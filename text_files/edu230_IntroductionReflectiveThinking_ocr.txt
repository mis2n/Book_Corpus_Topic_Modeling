  PREFACE 
In An Introduction to Reflective Thinking nine members 
of the staff of the Department of Philosophy at Colum- 
bia University have codperated in writing a book which 
is intended to show thinking at work by describing some 
of the great achievements of thought in the fields of 
science and morals. They have tried to indicate the 
characteristics of effective thinking and to clarify some 
of the methods of experimentation, investigation, and 
verification apparent in the thoughtful handling of va- 
rious subject-matters. The book may be used for a first 
course in philosophy, or in connection with an introduc- 
tion to science; and it is the hope of the authors that not 
a few persons who have gone out from college halls, or 
have never entered them, may find interesting this new 
survey of the workings of the mind. 
The authors have been much helped in their treat- 
ment of the different subject-matters by advice from 
colleagues. Among the many who have advised, especial 
thanks are due Professors John Dewey, F. J. E. Wood- 
bridge, W. T. Bush, and A. L. Jones, of the Department 
of Philosophy; Professor Henry Preserved Smith, of 
Union Theological Seminary ; Professor Harold Jacoby, 
of the Department of Astronomy; Professor W. B. Fite 
and Dean H. E. Hawkes, of the Department of Mathe- 
matics; Professor J. H. McGregor, of the Department of 
Zodlogy; Professor H. W. Farwell, of the Department 
of Physics; Dr. B. D. Wood, Assistant to the Dean of 
Columbia College; and Dean Harlan F. Stone, of the 
Law School.

AN INTRODUCTION TO 
REFLECTIVE THINKING 
CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION — WHAT REFLECTIVE THINKING 
MEANS 
Section 1. What Reflection Is? 
To speak of reflective thinking seems strange. Is not all 
thinking reflective? If all thought had to do with 
reaching a well-founded belief which could be defended 
from attack and which might. be followed in action, it 
would be possible to say that all thinking is reflective. 
But sometimes we think in a rambling sort of way and 
are not interested in any particular outcome. Man’s 
discovery of valuable hints as to the conduct of his life 
is of two kinds — rambling and direct. As dogs, when 
directions, follow a multitude of paths, and nose about 
under many fallen branches, thickets and patches of 
brambles, so human beings, when they idly, playfully 
think about the common objects of daily life, or about 
ideas so usual as to be old friends, display in their own 
way much the same activity as the roving dogs. Such 
activity is casual or undirected thinking, and it turns 
1 For this section, as for the entire text, a knowledge of John Dewey, 
How We Think (Heath & Co., 1910), is important since the ideas of that 
book have influenced greatly the writers of this one. Irwin Edman, Hu- 
man Traits and Their Social Significance (Houghton Mifflin Company, 
1920),. will also prove useful.
-P-A-G-E-10
2 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
up, now and then, important new combinations which 
may be valuable discoveries. 
Sometimes, too, our consciousness is fully taken up 
with the appreciative consideration of beautiful objects. 
A noble building, a chapel window of old glass, an au- 
tumn hillside with blue sky and floating cloud-bank 
above it, a chorus from Euripides or a simple and lucid 
mathematical solution may command our admiration. 
To deny to such appreciative mental experience a place 
in thought seems to do violence to the common under- 
standing of the term. 
On occasion thought may not be roving or primarily 
appreciative, but concerned only with the spinning of a 
yarn which makes no pretense to reaching correct be- 
lief, but is content, as Dewey says, merely to maintain 
an emotional congruity. Such thought must tell a 
story which holds together; it need not be concerned to 
make its content conform to statements about the ac- 
tual relations of things. 
When thought, however, is bent on solving a problem, 
on finding out the meaning of a perplexing situation, or 
reaching a conclusion which is trustworthy, it is to be 
distinguished from other types of mental activity and 
' should be called reflection. | Such thinking may be de- 
fined as: ‘‘active, persistent and careful consideration of 
any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of 
the grounds that support it and the further conclusions 
to which it tends.” ! 
Section 2. Dewey’s Analysis of an Act of Thought 
a. THE OCCASION OF REFLECTION 
The occasion of reflective thought becomes clear when 
the activities of a day are reviewed. We rise, dress,

INTRODUCTION 3 
breakfast, read headlines, go to business, but only when 
the morning’s mail brings up a question requiring a de- 
cision does real thought make its appearance. Thought 
comes when decisions or conclusions are necessary, when 
the usual succession of acts is interrupted and considera- 
tion has to be given to the next step.!_ A doctor thinks 
when he has to diagnose a new case, a lawyer thinks 
when he considers the elements of a dispute and their 
relation to precedent, a student thinks when he applies 
his knowledge to the solution of an original problem in 
geometry, a city official thinks when he considers the 
best method of making a tax levy or improving the 
school system. 
b. THE DEFINITION OF THE DIFFICULTY 
In each of these cases a difficulty is faced. The 
morning’s letter asks whether money should be invested 
in the common stock of an industry or in government 
bonds. Before any progress can be made in reaching 
an answer, the conditions of the question must be clari- 
fied. A widow of slender means is asking the question, 
how she may invest her capital most safely and profita- 
bly. The reader of the letter, understanding her situa- 
tion, has cleared his field, and the next step in thinking 
occurs. 
c. THE RISE OF SUGGESTIONS 
This next step is the rise of suggestions or possible an- 
swers. What advice is to be given — that is the per- 
plexity. Answers flash up— buy bonds, buy stocks, 
1 Consideration of thought when its operation is more contemplative 
than decisive will be found in Chapters IX and XIII. It is the hope of 
the authors that a later edition may contain a chapter on the place of 
reflection in esthetic judgments.

buy neither, but rather buy a farm mortgage. Such 
suggestions or others would arise. The psychological 
machinery of their appearance we do not fully under- 
stand, but the factors conditioning their excellence may 
be named. Save by chance, penetrating suggestions 
come only (a) when the difficulty is clearly defined, (6) 
when the thinker is thoroughly familiar with the back- 
ground into which the problem fits and has had a wide 
range of experience with similar difficulties, (c) when the 
thinker has a more or less indefinable something called 
now native ability, now disciplined but daring imagina- 
tion, now shrewdness, now penetration. 
d. THE MENTAL ELABORATION OF SUGGESTIONS 
When the suggestions have arisen, they must be 
tested by reference to foundations and consequences. 
Suppose the idea of buying stock should be entertained 
asthe solution. In thought the circumstances attending 
such investment would be reviewed — is the stock safe, 
what is its cost, what its return, what its likelihood of 
ready sale. Each item would be considered in refer- 
ence to the conditions of the purchaser, and if all the 
factors surveyed in the mental investigation fitted her 
need, the suggestion to buy stock would be thought to 
be a good one; if not, other proposed solutions would be 
tried in the mental examination. 
@. EVIDENCE IN FACT AND CONCLUSION 
When the suggestion is accepted, after this imagina- 
tive grilling, as apparently true, the careful thinker 
seeks confirming evidence — he may seek to ascertain 
the opinion of others as to the wisdom of his view, or in- 
vestigate the class of persons holding the stock. Such
-P-A-G-E-13
INTRODUCTION 5 
investigation may confirm his opinion and leave him 
ready to accept his judgment and say “buy.” Unhap- 
pily, before his advice is given he cannot, as he might in 
other kinds of decisions, experiment with the actual 
operation of his conclusion before determining finally 
upon practice. His experimentation for the verification 
of his belief must be undertaken at the widow’s expense, 
since after she follows his advice the genuine verifica- 
tion will follow when time shows whether the stock 
bought proves a safe and lucrative investment. The 
closing of the reflective process incident to his reaching 
a conclusion comes, however, only after the experimen- 
tal verification. 
The steps in the reflective process have been described 
in a logical and schematic fashion. In the actual think- 
ing of every day the order is sometimes as clear as the 
outline, but usually suggestions come to a person before 
he has analyzed the problem very far, in which case he 
develops the suggestions or hypotheses immediately. 
These suggestions, the outcome of a hasty or inadequate 
impression of the problem, are necessarily superficial 
and may lead seriously astray the man who accepts 
them precipitately. They may, on the other hand, 
guide and check the observation by which the difficulty 
is more precisely defined, and where the situation is 
complex and baffling, the final determination of the 
difficulty is possible only as the climax of such par- 
tial and tentative suggestions. Not infrequently in 
the successful completion of each of the steps practi- 
cally all are involved. An instance of such an occur- 
rence is given in the treatment of observation in the 
next chapter. Thus it will be seen that the order given 
above is seldom the order consistently followed in an
-P-A-G-E-14
  6 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
actual thinking process; it is rather a diagram of the 
necessary steps. a 
Section 8. The Variations in Human Ability 
The quality of reflective thinking will vary with the 
excellence or grade of the thinker. There is a very wide 
variation in human ability to think. A day’s walk 
through almost any county in this country, undertaken 
as a kind of exploration into the society of human minds, 
would be a startling excursion for an acute observer who 
is at once a good questioner and listener. At the end 
of the day the inventory of minds would show a range of 
ability reaching from the near idiot to the near genius; 
the real genius or the complete idiot would be difficult 
to find. The stock-taking in the evening would, how- 
ever, abound in middle grades. Most men are neither 
geniuses nor idiots. 
The thoroughgoing explorer might undertake to work 
out sharply contrasting classifications for the minds he 
had encountered. He would find that he had few per- 
fect examples of these sharp distinctions, but many 
minds that had certain amounts of both contrasting 
qualities. He would distinguish the educated and the 
uneducated, but he would find most of his specimens in 
the partly educated class. He would call some minds 
resourceful and some helpless, though few would be 
thoroughly helpless under all circumstances. Some of 
his discoveries would be classified as impetuous, others 
deliberate; but almost none would always think things 
out before conclusions were accepted or actions under-

INTRODUCTION 7 
taken. A few would be subject to all kinds of supersti- 
tions, even the most obviously absurd; while others 
would be so critical and analytical as to cause the stock- 
taker to wonder if they would ever accept any statement 
as above suspicion. Another group would be entered 
as narrow or closed-minded, and their brothers at the 
other extreme ultra-liberal, some even faddists. Closely 
akin to this classification would come the rigid minded, 
and their contrasting group the flexible minded, or, in 
slightly varied terms, the traditional or hidebound and 
the progressive or free-minded folk. Then there might 
be the imaginative with the literal-minded as opposites. 
And for a last contrast the far-sighted matched by the 
short-sighted, or, put differently, the predicting and the 
surprised. 
These classifications are but the faintest beginning of 
the analysis to which the day’s observation of human 
minds might be subjected. But carried even this little 
way, one is led to exclaim, “ What striking contrasts and 
varied traits are to be found in the society of minds!” 
A question is apt to arise at this point, some interro- 
gation as to the value of these different minds. Before 
an answer could be given, one would have to know just 
what kind of value was to be considered. A slow and 
stolid mind may be good under certain conditions; great 
imagination useful under others. If, however, those 
minds were, for the time, considered most valuable that 
could best find out the ‘‘real truth” about things, that 
would care most keenly to be right, and that could go 
on to make new discoveries about the world of men 
and things in which we live, it seems likely that cer- 
tain of the traits would be found much more desirable 
than others.  
-P-A-G-E-16
  
8 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
A man suddenly confronted with a new kind of dan- 
ger, such as swept over the Canadian lines when the 
first gray-green waves of poison gas were released, would 
want as his comrade in distress a fellow creature who 
was something more than a bundle of fixed habits. 
Such a man might do a well-learned and often-repeated 
task very well indeed. Habitual ways of doing things 
are genuinely first-rate, after their fashion. They are 
good servants, taking over the performance of the thous- 
and and one acts which we all have to do every day. 
But they are fixed, otherwise they would not be habits. 
The set, rigid, inflexible, unvarying behavior which 
characterizes the predominately habitual man cannot 
successfully meet new situations. The blind man can 
make his way easily over old ground, but on a new and 
unlearned path he walks slowly, and is in danger at 
every step. The habit-man is a blind man, he is not a 
pathfinder. 
This does not mean, of course, that the ideal discov- 
erer is the man who has had no previous knowledge of 
the ground he surveys. The intellectual explorer in any 
field should be acquainted with, familiar with, habitu- 
ated to, the subject in which he works. But this habitu- 
ation must not mean the easy following of long familiar 
routes; routination is the greatest enemy of progress. 
Another kind of man who cannot help in the sudden 
danger is the impulsive person. A big bluebottle fly in 
a sunlit room buzzes about in a most energetic way, but 
there seems no direction or purpose to its blundering 
flight. Its activity is “full of sound and fury signifying 
nothing”; it does n’t know what it’s about. Neither do 
some human beings when in a kind of feverish haste 
they try first this, then that way out, instead of taking
-P-A-G-E-17
  
  INTRODUCTION 9 
stock of the difficult situation first and estimating the 
varying likelihood of success attending each possible 
line of action considered. 
It seems clear that neither the habitual nor the impul- 
sive man who follows on the instant whichever control- 
ling tendency is present can be called an intellectual 
leader. Such men cannot be trusted to blaze new and 
reliable trails in the wilderness of human ignorance. 
Yet for all that, trails have been blazed, and for many 
hundreds of centuries they were hacked out, not in a wil- 
derness, but ina veritable jungle. When we look back 
on the eight or nine thousand years of history, and let 
our imagination reconstruct the one hundred thousand 
or more years of human life that went before, and the 
half million years of pre-human yet man-like existence 
that separate human beings from their more brute-like 
ancestors, we ask ourselves how man ever came to be 
civilized at all. A part of the answer is that happy 
accidents occurred. They may have helped in getting 
fires going, in the cooking of flesh, and in the smelting 
of metals. Another fact is that there were rare individ- 
uals who were curious — free and flexible minded — 
and tried different combinations. They had imagina- 
tion and after a time could tell in advance what would 
happen if different things were put together. They 
were able to predict. Their efforts were short-lived 
until speech and writing became the transmitters and 
preservers of knowledge. But after that the store of 
knowledge increased, and those acquainted with it (the 
educated, if they also displayed curiosity, imagination, 
and the ability to predict) were able to find out more 
and more ways of doing things, of escaping dangers, 
of producing pleasing and desirable things. .
-P-A-G-E-18
  10 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
Just here, when the benefits which progressive minds 
have brought to man have been indicated, one should 
stop for a moment to consider how sharply two-edged 
the sword of human intelligence is. Men find out 
things which are of great use — explosives, steam, elec- 
tricity, gas, and so on — and yet just these same things 
unless kept in control turn against their discoverers. 
Steam and steel made railroads possible, but they also 
create congested cities, prove sources of high finance 
and public corruption, and give us an apparently never- 
ending series of labor troubles. The mind of man seems 
much more capable of learning how to control nature 
than of learning how to use the new knowledge to the 
complete good of human beings. 
This melancholy fact does not, however, diminish the 
brilliance of the pathfinders. It only indicates the su- 
preme importance of men who can work effectively on 
the many problems of human relationship. We have 
many good bridge engineers. We need good engineers 
of social relationships and institutions, of economics, 
politics, law, and education. 
After all, only a small number of men have sufficient 
originality (a combination, still, of curiosity, imagina- 
tion, and prediction) to break through habits and avoid 
the difficulties of impulse. The discoverers are like field 
‘ marshals or generals. They need great armies, supplied 
with minor leaders, to be sure, but composed largely of 
the rank and file. Man might well be proud if each hu- 
man being could rank as a general by reason of his men- 
tal penetration; since, however, in the society of minds 
few attain the grade of genius, the part of wisdom is to 
make capital of the discoverers and create a quick and 
ready understanding of and sympathy with them.
-P-A-G-E-19
  INTRODUCTION ll 
y The function of education, in large part, is the mould- 
/ ing of minds capable of taking and using the best that 
the world has given. Such minds must be well stored 
with information, free from prejudice, critical of new 
ideas presented, and fitted to understand the kind and 
quantity of proof required before they may adopt the 
pronouncements of the generals of the society of minds. 
To be sure a formal education is probably the first step 
in the career of these generals, but nature has already 
given them an endowment far surpassing that of the 
average man. 
To come back to just this average man. He makes 
up most of the world’s population, but he has not begun 
to use his power in a well-trained and disciplined way. 
His mind is an instrument for the control of things and 
of men. The keener, the more penetrating, the more 
persistent, the more inclusive the operation of this mind 
is, the greater is the likelihood of the moulding of the 
world in which we live into an environment satisfying 
our needs. Not merely in the attainment of the satis- 
faction of human wants is the mind the instrument, but 
in the criticism of these wants or needs it is the agent. 
The kind of life which seems natural, the kind of values 
which are accepted without hesitation, the plays and 
pictures, clothes and houses which men admire may be 
accepted quite uncritically as a nation’s, a group’s, or a 
family’s inheritance. If accepted critically or rejected 
with reason or modified consciously, it is because the 
mind has been at work, the mind as an instrument in the 
creation of a more excellent human existence. 
Section 4. How Thought is Limited 
If thought is such a creative and vital element in a
-P-A-G-E-20
  12 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
plastic world, one wonders why the world is n’t by now 
a kind of restored Garden of Eden. There are many 
reasons why it is not. One of the most important of 
these is to be found in man’s own nature which is im- 
petuous, impulsive, and passionate. Thought is slow; 
the very term ‘‘reflection’”’ comes from the Latin words 
— “back” and ‘“‘to turn.” Thought is deliberate and 
questioning. Appetite is headlong and compelling. 
Some one has said that we are ninety-five per cent habit 
and desire, and five per cent thought. The figures may 
be wrong, but the idea is right. Take a single instance — 
that of eating. Thought can determine and regulate a 
diet, but a hungry boy eats anything in sight and as 
much of it as he can hold — there is no check to his ap- 
petite. The motive power of our natural desires drives 
us, and thought lags behind, and comes to our rescue 
only when trouble surprises us. 
Habit is another of thought’s excluders. When we get 
into any particular habit, we repeat acts easily and com- 
fortably as a perfectly adjusted and well-oiled engine 
runs in a power plant. The engine does n’t think; 
neither need we in that part of our life which is so well 
unified as to run itself. Habits grow into a very real 
part of us, and we like them. Old ways are pleasant 
ways, and we love them and hate those things or per- 
sons that disturb them. When we are defending our hab- 
its — of belief just as well as of act — passion reinforces 
custom; and criticism or reconsideration has a poor 
chance to win the day. All this is not at all to say that 
the drive of desire and the easy continuity of habit are 
not good things. They are; but they may take over too 
completely the management of a human life. When 
they control, we miss discrimination, freedom of action,
-P-A-G-E-21
INTRODUCTION 13 
change, improvement. They make us feel comfortable 
and pretty contented, and thought implies a real dis- 
content, not complaining, but energetically investiga- 
tory. ; 
The defense of habits of thought manifests itself in a 
multitude of ways. ‘“‘ Prejudice’ is derived from roots 
meaning “‘a judgment before.” When we are preju- 
diced, we tend to repeat an earlier decision and to object 
to interference. Under such circumstances we are apt to 
refuse to consider. Men find themselves swayed by 
personal preferences, self-advantage, dislike of one of 
the parties of a controversy; and in this mingling of de- 
sire and habit, they are apt to omit unbiased considera- 
tion of all of the factors in the case. 
Another trouble with thought is that it requires a 
considerable accumulation of experience and knowl- 
edge. Not everybody can think well because not ev- 
erybody knows enough. And what applies to persons 
applies to peoples too. Fancy expecting an Eskimo to 
think out anelectric heater! To get such an accumula- 
tion of knowledge as thought requires, men must have 
a stable civilization, books and investigators who 
bequeath their findings, schools or places to impart 
knowledge. Thought on a wide range of subjects makes 
very large demands indeed. 
New thinking requires besides old information a hu- 
man endowment of great imagination, and this we have 
seen is a rare native gift. It requires also means of ex- 
perimentation, of checking up the brilliant idea to see how 
the world of fact corresponds to the hypothesis formed. 
How could a doctor be sure that he had found in a small

The path-finders need instruments, tools to enable them 
to use their own personal instrument — thought. 
Section 6. Mind and the Future 
From what has been said already it is clear that man’s 
ability to think is his most powerful weapon in his com- 
bat with nature, and in his ascent to the level of genu- 
inely humane existence. It is not at all difficult to see 
why mind by reason of its presence in the world en- 
hances even the glory of reality. Understanding, ap- 
ptaisal, criticism, appreciation, prediction, verification, 
control — all these are products of mind. 
The utility of mind has already shown itself in the 
development of well-organized systems of belief — the 
exact sciences, and in the application of these beliefs, 
sometimes called truths, to practical problems. The 
great French scientist Pasteur stated in abstract terms 
that fermentation could not take place in sterile fluids. 
Then he proceeded to apply his knowledge to the 
preservation of export wines. He had an ‘‘idea,”’ he 
tested it by experimentation to his entire satisfaction, 
and then he had the courage to say, ‘‘I can put this idea 
to work in the practical everyday life of men.” 
In the future one may expect an indefinite advance in 
our theoretical understanding of physical phenomena, 
and in our actual control of natural forces. Old opera- 
tions will be performed more easily and new ones added. 
Even the most enthusiastic prophet would probably 
fall far short of the accomplishment which only a hun- 
dred years will see. 
It is not too much to expect that in the understanding 
of man’s nature notable advance will be made. We 
know more now about individual and public health than

had been suspected in 1840. The knowledge of bacteri- 
ological infections, anesthetics, and, with these two, 
practically the whole of modern surgery has come since 
then. Psychology and human physiology, or the study 
of man’s behavior, are but infant sciences. Their de- 
velopment will probably greatly increase the welfare of 
men. 
An exact and dispassionate study of, and a, scientific 
procedure in, the field of group life is still a goal to be 
accomplished. In spite of this fact the study of public 
administration is each year increasing and new ways of 
obtaining control over group action are being standard- 
ized. No one can say of the phenomena of human behav- 
ior, individual or group, that they are simple, static, 
or as yet thoroughly predictable. But many believe 
that, in spite of their great variety, and their complica- 
tion by reason of consciousness, we shall some day un- 
derstand and direct them. 
Section 6. The Purpose and Method of the Book 
The advantages of a reflective life have been indicated 
very incompletely in the preceding pages, but enough 
has been said to make clear the importance of thought 
in a life which is interested in the selection of the best. 
This book is written to emphasize the part which 
thought plays in the formation of beliefs, and to stimu- 
late its readers to a more lively realization of the road to 
a more congenial world which lies open to those who 
think: It hopes to point out some of the workings of 
thought and the habits of mind which those who desire 
to participate in the enterprise of knowing should culti- 
vate. It does not desire to hide the dangers to which 
thought is exposed, nor to omit the limitations which 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  16 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
thought encounters. It cannot expect to make men 
think, but it may make them desire to do so and aid 
them in their effort. 
For the accomplishment of its purpose the book fol- 
lows the method of presenting contrasting solutions of a 
series of problems. It may be that through the under- 
standing of two beliefs about the same circumstances — 
such as the relations of the heavenly bodies which both 
Ptolemy and Copernicus studied — and through the real- 
ization of the way in which these beliefs were reached 
and the reasons why one was discarded and another 
kept, some appreciation of the character of thought at 
its best may be reached, and some of its methods laid 
hold of by the reader. 
In the course of the presentation much of the material 
which logic has treated in a formal way is shown in a 
setting so concrete and real as to bring it near to the ac- 
tual thinking of the reader. By watching the thought 
game of some of the masters perhaps the rules which 
they used will be better understood and followed by the 
novices than they could be if the rules were all read to- 
gether in the ‘‘Laws of Thought.’’ The older so-called 
formal logic seems strangely technical and remote to the 
student of the present day. Its nice distinctions and 
mathematical precision may be appreciated and en- 
joyed, but they do not seem to be carried out of the text- 
book into everyday thinking. Yet the importance of the 
end which the traditional logic seeks to accomplish was 
perhaps never more appreciated than it is to-day. To 
serve this end, which is the increase of thought and the 
improvement of its quality, a new approach has been 
adopted. : 
A careful reading of the Table of Contents will show

  INTRODUCTION 17 
the progress of the text. Through chapters two to six, 
the stages in an act of thought are illustrated and devel- 
oped by the examples chosen. In the chapter on “‘Di- 
agnosis” the meaning of observation, definition, and 
classification are treated as elements in clearing up a 
difficulty — the second stage in an act of thought. In 
chapter three, ‘‘The Development of Hypotheses in As- 
tronomy,” the suggestions or probable solutions are es- 
pecially emphasized. The elaboration or verification of 
hypotheses or tentatively accepted suggestions (the 
fourth and fifth steps in an act of thought) form 
the theme of the fourth chapter on ‘“‘The Methods 
of Experimental Science,” with its treatment of induc- 
tive reasoning, and of the fifth chapter on ‘‘ Deductive 
Elaboration and the Relation of Implication in Math- 
ematics.’”’ Chapter six brings with it a general consid- 
eration of the whole problem of explanation. Chapter 
seven, on “Evolution,” gives in broad outline the devel- 
opment of all the steps in thought by the survey of the 
history of a great inquiry. This chapter, too, presents 
the part which anthropomorphic influences play in our 
thinking. Historical investigation and its methods are 
the subject of chapter eight. This treatment of the con- 
trasting methods of handling an historic document has 
been included since men are so commonly uninformed and 
uncritical in their acceptance of traditional views. The 
last section of the book, including chapters nine to 
twelve, deals with problems of value, questions of 
better or worse, and attempts to show in what fashion re- 
flection serves as a guide to right opinion on personal and 
social problems. - A summary chapter brings a review 
of the principles and methods of thought which have 
been illustrated and developed throughout the book. 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  18 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
In the early chapters including the treatment of. his- 
torical method, the illustrations are from fields in which 
a definite and on the whole an accepted method of veri- 
fication has been worked out. In the natural sciences 
we have found how to reach conclusions to which men 
will generally assent. In the later chapters, dealing 
with conclusions about values, good things and bad, de- 
sirable and undesirable, we find a different situation. 
There is little agreement on findings and there are few ob- 
jective methods of verification. One of the chief reasons 
for increasing the acquaintance with the kind of thinking 
which has brought certainty in science is to increase the 
possibility and desire of applying reflection in the so- 
called social sciences. We know fairly well the inter- 
actions of material forces; we know very poorly the in- 
terplay of psychological forces. Yet our attainment of 
@ more secure and reasonable existence in a world so 
complicated as our own requires such knowledge. Re- 
flective thought must win new victories in the empire 
of man.

CHAPTER II 
DIAGNOSIS: ANCIENT EGYPT AND THE MASSACHU- 
SETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL 
OBSERVATION — CLASSIFICATION — DEFINITION 
Section 1. Two Ways of Treating a Sick Man 
On October 8, 1906, a farmer entered the Massachu- 
setts General Hospital. He was thirty-five years of age. 
About August Ist he began to have eruptions, swellings 
in various parts of his body. He had previously been 
treated for an attack of a disease of the skin character- 
ized by non-inflammatory swellings on various parts of 
the skin and mucous membranes. In the middle of Au- 
gust he had smothering sensations in his chest, which 
lasted from one to three hours. On October 3d he be- 
gan to have headache, which grew rapidly worse. On 
October 6th he had a chill at 3 p.m., and the next day 
one at 7 P.M. Since the onset of his headache, he had 
fever continuously. He had lost much money recently, 
but said he did not worry about it. A physical exami- 
nation showed that glands in the neck, armpits, and 
groins could be felt. An examination of his chest and 
abdomen revealed no signs of disease.! : 
If this man had lived in Egypt, let us say in the year 
400 B.c., what would the doctors have done with him? 
As far as we can judge from the remaining historical rec- 
ords, he would have been treated by many physicians, 
each one specializing upon the difficulties presented in 
1 The facts of this case have been described almost verbatim after

DIAGNOSIS 21 
some particular part of the man’s body. One physician 
would have applied some paste or liquid to the swelling: 
in his mouth. A second would have recommended 
something for the smothering sensations in his chest, ¢ 
third for his headache, and a fourth for his chill. Still 
another would have applied himself to the reduction of 
his fever, and perhaps some one might also have been 
found to suggest a treatment for the glands. Mean- 
while what would have happened to the man receiving all 
this attention? Perhaps he would feel a little better for 
it. Some of his aches and pains might in this way be re- 
moved. But for several weeks he probably would not 
feel wholly well. He might get suddenly worse, and die, 
or he might recover quite completely, and in another 
month or two forget entirely about his illness. At any 
rate, during the course of his illness, it is highly prob- 
able that he would not avoid contact with other people. 
When not feeling too miserable, he would probably be 
up and about, he would see his friends as usual, and his 
way of life at home would not be changed. In conse- 
quence of this, it is very likely that others who lived 
with him, or even near his dwelling, would soon fall ill, 
and also be obliged to seek the aid of doctors.1 
Now what happened to the farmer at the Massachu- 
setts General Hospital in 1906? First, a doctor exam- 
ined him carefully. This doctor asked himself the ques- 
tion: What is really the matter with this man? What 
is his trouble fundamentally? What disease has he? 
What the doctor saw upon a first examination of the 
patient suggested several diseases as possibilities. 
Though the man said he did not worry about his money

-P-A-G-E-30
  22 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
losses, perhaps he did, and such anxiety continued over 
a considerable period of time might possibly account for 
hissymptoms. The chills might indicate malaria. The 
glandular enlargement suggested the possibility of 
syphilis, or of leukemia, a condition occasioned by an 
excess of white corpuscles in the blood. Finally, the 
swellings which appeared on various mucous mem- 
branes, and for which the patient had been previously 
treated, might themselves explain some of the other 
symptoms, such as the headache and the fever. And if 
these swellings were also present in the respiratory tract, 
they might account for the smothering sensations which 
the man had experienced in his chest some weeks earlier. 
The doctor considered each of these suggestions in 
turn. The constancy of the patient’s fever seemed to 
eliminate the possibility of his condition being due to 
financial anxiety alone. A microscopic examination of 
his blood likewise promptly negatived the suggestion of 
malaria. Moreover, the blood appeared wholly normal 
in other respects, the number of white corpuscles and 
their proportion to the red corpuscles being such as to 
prevent a diagnosis of the case as leukemia. The glan- 
dular enlargement itself, which had suggested leukemia 
was not at all general. Not general enough to support 
the thought of syphilis, and there was nothing else in the 
case to suggest syphilis. Indeed the glandular condi- 
tions were such as are frequently found in normal per- 
sons, so that there was no need to regard them as patho- 
logical at all. Finally, if the headache and fever were 
due to the swellings, there ought to have been some ex- 
ternal eruptions on the skin, since such swellings almost 
never occur on mucous surfaces and serous membranes 
alone.
-P-A-G-E-31
  DIAGNOSIS 23 
Thus none of the doctor’s suggestions seemed to him 
convincing. He was confronted with a patient having 
“a continued fever and nothing to show for it.” This 
very inability to associate the fever with any of the 
other symptoms made the doctor suspect typhoid. For 
typhoid fever is a disease which presents a great variety 
of general symptoms, no one of which, however, occurs 
in all cases, except possibly the fever itself. (And even 
the fever may sometimes be absent, at least for a time. 
— ‘‘Afebrile’” cases) The diagnostic principle which 
physicians employ in this predicament may be formu- 
lated somewhat as follows: In any case of continued 
fever, where the other symptoms lead to no positive 
diagnosis, make laboratory tests for typhoid fever. 
There are six or seven specific laboratory tests for 
typhoid fever, and two of them are in very general use. 
In this case the doctor had a specimen of the patient’s 
blood sent to the laboratory, to see if a typhoid culture 
could be developed from it. The culture revealed ty- 
phoid bacilli. This completed the diagnosis, the patient 
could now be isolated as a typhoid case, and all our 
knowledge of that disease applied to his cure, and to the 
protection of others. 
Section 2. Differences in Observation and Their Causes 
The Egyptian and the modern treatments both rested 
on the observation of a patient suffering from typhoid. 
The Egyptians looked at the man carefully, no doubt. 
They saw a number of different ailments. They treated 
each separately. They did not see the typhoid bacillus 
at all. It is easy to say, then, that the observation at- 
tendant on the location of the difficulties (the cause of 
the man’s illness) was the reason for the difference in
-P-A-G-E-32
  24 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
treatment. But to understand why that difference in 
observation existed, is not so easy as the saying. 
The location of the difficulty by the modern physician 
depended on his knowing what to look for, what to dis- 
regard, how to check his findings. These items in turn 
depended upon the accumulation of a great body of 
medical knowledge. The first point concerning the excel- 
lence of the observation is, therefore, that men observe 
with the eye of the past. The most searching analysis 
of the difficulty is possible only when the searcher is ac- 
quainted with his field. The modern physician had, as a 
part of his medical equipment, the constantly function- 
ing knowledge that fever is a key symptom, and that it 
is sometimes caused by microscopic organisms which 
can be determined by laboratory tests and which must 
be the center of medical attack. Until the middle of the 
nineteenth century men did n’t know how to find nor 
how to interpret these organisms. Men observe with 
the eye of the past. 
But such a statement needs qualification. Although 
the past furnishes the background of experience and 
knowledge necessary to the understanding of a problem, 
not everything in the past is important, and not the 
past alone will fit for discovery by observation. The 
past is rich because there have been men of genius who 
have seen afresh, who, in the words of the analysis of our 
act of thought, have had new and fruitful suggestions 
as to the problems at hand and who have diligently 
checked their findings. Their discoveries remain em- 
bedded in the heritage of the past, yet they are perpetu- 
ally new, for they may be rechecked at will by any new 
investigator. To see clearly with the eye of the past 
means to use such signal discoveries as illuminate the
-P-A-G-E-33
' DIAGNOSIS 25 
present situation and to keep these verified by reinvesti- 
gation. But to do this is not enough to secure the best 
observations. As additions were made in bygone years 
to the fund of knowledge, so to-day men come at their 
problem with inquiring minds and searching observa- 
tion, and, because they have in addition to past knowl- 
edge a spark of genius, imagination, deeper insight, they 
see things which have never been noticed before or 
thought important. Such men are usually willing to 
take great pains to be thorough and exhaustive in their 
investigation, and to follow every implication or sugges- 
tion, even the most casual, which appears while the 
investigation is proceeding. These discoverers are in 
most instances high in the scale of intelligence. They 
bring great native endowment to their work. They 
work thoroughly; they use the past, but they are not 
blinded by it, for they look with searching attention for 
new factors which will explain and control the difficulty 
at hand. 
In observing the fever and taking it asa key symptom, 
the modern physician would not proceed to diagnose 
without getting all the available qualifying information 
about his patient. He could not clarify or define his dif- 
ficulty merely by saying ‘“‘fever.”’ Had his patient been 
a young child and the fever slight, he might not have 
made fever his key. Had his patient had none of the 
symptoms associated with the onset of typhoid, the fe- 
ver would not have been so significant for his diagnosis, 
or at any rate might not so clearly have indicated a 
specific diagnosis. The observation, then, included the 
whole case. The diagnosis, furthermore, called for fur- 
ther investigation and further observation of the blood 
when tested. The observation was comprehensive.
-P-A-G-E-34
ee eer eee 
26 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
Observation, furthermore, if complete, is not limited 
to an isolated circumstance, but is progressive. With 
Hippocrates in Greece (c. 460-359 B.c.) men began to 
realize that the history and course of a disease had to be 
known and studied. Our modern examiner would ask 
for the history of the patient, and our modern hospital 
would keep a record of daily, sometimes hourly, change. 
Why? Because the most significant feature for diagno- 
sis may be the relation of the observed facts to one an- 
other, rather than each fact taken singly. The great 
mistake of the Egyptians was their failure to connect 
their observations sufficiently. Observation is at work 
all through the thought process and its verification. 
v Observation depends on something more than seeing 
or hearing. It is reinforced by suggestions arising in its 
course. The physician observes characteristic a. This 
perceived, suggestions arise as to probable additional 
characteristics b, c, and d usually associated with a. 
Back he goes in his observing to see if b, c, and d are 
there; hidden away, perhaps, but there. Observation 
demands the whole man and not merely his sense or- 
gans. This fact throws additional light on the state- 
ment that the trained observer is one who knows his 
field through and through. The young physician in the 
clinic marvels at the things which his chief sees and looks 
for. But his chief sees with his mind’s eye, and the 
young physician has not yet freely developed this indis- 
pensable organ of acute and searching observation. 
Important as is this inner sense organ, the fact must 
not be neglected that perfect sense organs of the unusual 
kind are necessary for trustworthy observation. The 
Egyptian physician might have been handicapped for all 
his observing by bad vision. So, too, might his modern 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
  DIAGNOSIS a 
colleague, but this observer of to-day could correct or 
offset his physiological handicap by glasses. His fail- 
ing hearing he might find harder to compensate, and 
through it he might miss important symptoms in the 
sounds of the heart or lungs. Were the hearing unusu- 
ally keen and well trained in detecting the slightest ab- 
normalities the physician would have a corresponding 
advantage — provided, of course, that his mind’s ear 
knew the significance of these rarely detected sounds. 
Physiological normality or supernormality are precondi- 
tions to correct observation. 
Another kind of eye, still, is used in observing to sup- 
plement the human organism. The modern diagnosti- 
cian is greatly handicapped unless he has at hand his 
laboratory with its equipment of microscopes to increase 
his vision many fold and give him access to exact obser- 
vations of the most minute organisms which may be the 
root cause of the disease. He also creates elaborate ap- 
paratus for the experimental or artificial construction of 
conditions under which he can verify a suggestion which 
arises as he observes his case. He has instruments of all 
kinds to use in his examination, merely to get complete 
observation so that the difficulty may be made so thor- 
oughly clear that the proper solution may arise. The 
thermometer is one of his most constant assistants. He 
does not have to rely on flushed cheeks or hot brow, felt 
by a hand which may itself vary in temperature as it is 
plunged in hot or cold water before it touches his pa- 
tient. His little glass instrument with its mercury col- 
umn, tested by a constant standard, cannot mistake; it 
has no subjective factor which must be discounted. 
Helpful mechanical instruments, keen senses, and a 
proper mental attitude are, therefore, the three pre- 
   
-P-A-G-E-36
    28 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
requisites to correct observation. By a proper mental 
attitude is meant having valuable information which 
guides your investigation fruitfully, being free of preju- 
dices or prejudgments, and so on. Correct observation 
is the very first demand of science, for tested facts are 
like stones out of which the solid edifice of knowledge is 
built. But how do we know when our observations are 
correct? When can we be sure we have the facts? This 
is a difficult question which we cannot answer very sat- 
isfactorily until we have surveyed the whole process of 
reflective thinking. Suffice it to say, at this point that 
there are three principal tests of observation. The first 
is the agreement of competent investigators; the second 
is the agreement and congruity of observations with 
each other. And the third is the utility of observations 
in helping us to solve our problems. 
Section 3. Classification and Implication 
The doctors in Egypt and in the Massachusetts Gen- 
eral Hospital had both classified their patients. The 
difference between the physicians was that their classifi- 
cations were not equally significant. The Egyptian 
had a class ‘‘enlarged glands.”’ For this class he had 
one treatment. ‘The modern has not one class ‘“‘en- 
larged glands,’ but several, falling under different 
causal classifications. Not the superficial appearance of 
the glands is the basis of classification, but the underly- 
ing and fundamental ailment of which the glands are 
but one manifestation. The importance of the way in 
which things are grouped varies with the significance or 
implication of the basis of classification. 
The nature of the instances under consideration, and 
the uses to which the knowledge about them will be put, 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
DIAGNOSIS , 29 
must both be known before things can be arranged to- 
gether. One single object may be put in half a dozen 
different classes, and each time usefully, if it serves the 
purpose of the classifier. The classification of enlarged 
glands, as ‘‘things to be treated in order to cure the 
man,” was bad, for the more important ‘‘thing to be 
treated”’ was the bacillus causing the fever, and if the 
man was to be cured, the right thing had to be put in the 
class ‘things to be treated.” But the typhoid patient 
could also be classified by the health authorities as 
“possible cause of infection,” as ‘‘patient for Ward D,” 
as “holder of disability insurance,” as ‘interesting ty- 
phoid case with new features,’”’ or as ‘Smith, Martin 
Stone,” with perfect propriety and usefulness. 
The reason such grouping is useful is that it carries 
with it implications. Call the man “‘cause of infection,” 
and that means ‘‘keep him from infecting others.” It 
also means “‘case which came from town X, and town X 
must be inspected in regard to its milk and water sup- 
ply.” This fact of implication gives further indication 
of the skill required in making and interpreting classifi- 
cation. Nothing must be put in a class having certain 
implications unless it, too, has them; and no classifica- 
tion can be understood and made use of unless the user 
knows its wider meaning. But to the physician who 
knows what typhoid means, the diagnosis by any expert 
of a patient, as of the group typhoid cases, is full of sig- 
nificance because this group has associated with it rules 
for care and cure. 
A class may be too large for significance. The ty- 
phoid patient is a sick man — true, and in a sense sig- 
nificant, because this means he must have attention. 
But put him in the class suffering from “bacillus typho-
-P-A-G-E-38
30 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
sus” and he can be treated specifically. A class isa key 
to meaning, and the richer in meaning it is for a par- 
ticular purpose — such as effecting a cure — the better 
is the classification. 
The history of progress in the sciences is in a sense 
the history of classification. When Copernicus put the 
earth in the class ‘‘body revolving about the sun,’’ he 
worked a revolution. But before he could make a class 
of ‘‘bodies revolving about the sun,” he had to under- 
stand the system of heavenly bodies and their relations. 
Classes, then, are a product of investigation. When 
significant characteristics are found in a number of bod- 
ies, a class may be made, and to include a body in that 
class means thereafter to give it all the significance of the 
class. Good observation demands the whole of one’s 
powers; it is not mere looking. Good classification re- 
quires the most comprehensive knowledge, not mere 
ordering in group by any chance resemblance. 
In a real sense classification is the basic process in all 
the steps of thought. A circumstance would not ap- 
pear difficult if it were recognized at once as falling into 
a class, and on the other hand, if it resisted ordering un- 
der every relationship, it could never be understood; in 
fact, such utterly unrelated circumstances would prob- 
ably not stir us, for the thing which perplexes us is the 
questionably or partly classified, rather than the totally 
unrelated. When a suggestion arises it is significant 
only in so far as it associates the perplexing element 
with a class or classes through union with which it gains 
clarity. In the final acceptance of the suggestion con- 
fidence is felt that an exact classification has really been 
accomplished. Such an achievement may, furthermore, 
involve some adjustment in classes already established
-P-A-G-E-39

if the new difficulty solved presents aspects different 
from other members of a class to which it belongs by 
reason of exhibiting the more significant characteristics 
of that group. 
Section 4. Definition as a Formula for Work 
When things have been put in classes, men frequently 
find it convenient to record the fact in concise form, for 
their own convenience in explaining what a thing is, and 
as a service to others who may know the name of a thing 
but nothing of its relationships. 
The malady which we call typhoid fever men studied 
for many years, and as they made new discoveries they 
recorded them in a brief formula of identification and 
implication. In other words, they defined typhoid. 
The definition would not be complete until it was such 
a compressed classification and identification as would 
point out typhoid and no other disease. The definition 
might be, “‘typhoid is a fever usually associated with 
such and such symptoms, with such and such a bacillus 
determinable through laboratory tests of a specified 
character, and responding to treatment of a prescribed 
nature.” The definition would be good if it were unerr- 
ing; that is, if it would give such a class and such sub- 
classes as could apply to typhoid and typhoid only. The 
definition would then be exact, not so narrow as to ex- 
clude any case, nor so broad as to take in any case not 
typhoid. A brief definition suitable for dictionary or 
encyclopedia purposes rather than a descriptive one 
valuable for the physician might be “‘typhoid is a fever 
caused by Bacillus typhosus.’’! 
The definition would be a formula for work because it 
; 1 Encyclopedia Britannica,
-P-A-G-E-40
  82 ' REFLECTIVE THINKING 
would carry within itself indications of tests to verify 
the identity of the thing defined. If it said, caused by 
bacillus typhosus and gave the methods of testing for 
this bacillus, it would be as good as to say, ‘‘make these 
tests and find out if this case you think to be typhoid 
really is that.”” Who had made this definition? Medi- 
cal men who worked before the physician now using 
it. Why had they included these items of information? 
Because each was significant for identification or for 
subsequent action in handling the disease. The framers 
of the definition had had their eyes on practice, and the 
doctor who used the definition found in it a guide for his 
observation: a fever—yes; a bacillus discovered and 
identified by specific tests — yes; the disease responding 
to the prescribed treatment — yes. The case is clear, 
this sick man belongs to that well-known class of ty- 
phoid patients. 
It is very clear that classification and definition are 
closely related. Classification involves definition, and 
definition is possible only by including the thing defined 
within a class, and then by identifiable characteristics 
separating it from other members of the class. Both 
are important in clarifying the situation because of the 
implications contained in them; and both in their fram- 
ing are determined by the purposes which they are 
meant to serve. 
Section 5. Summary 
* The discussion of the two cases of diagnosis and the 
explanation of some of the processes useful in clearing 
up a doubtful situation have emphasized several factors. 
In adequate observation a basic idea is important, such 
as, ‘fever is the significant and correlating phenom-
-P-A-G-E-41
  
DIAGNOSIS 33 
enon.” The past may give us such an idea, but the pres- 
ent must always recheck and be alert to discover a still 
better idea. Personal interest or bias may befog obser- 
vation or lead it astray. Observation must not miss 
any circumstances; it must know all about the past and 
future of the thing to be observed. Observation de- 
mands a rich fund of knowledge in order that an “‘inner 
eye” may interpret the facts observed and make capital 
of their implications. The observer must use all his 
senses, unimpaired, and may supplement them by in- 
struments, apparatus, and experiment. 
In valuable classification, groups must be based on 
t genuinely significant similarities. The purpose of the 
classification will determine its character. The impor- 
tance of classification resides in the fact that to classify 
is to give a member of the class a group of implications. 
Classification cannot be valuable unless there is present 
a penetrating and comprehensive knowledge of the 
thing to be classified and of all its relationships. 
Definition is compressed classification. The defini- 
tion must prove the means of identifying the thing de- 
fined and no other. The definition is a formula for work 
because it indicates means of doing or observing things 
to render sure the identification of the thing defined.

  CHAPTER III 
TIIE DEVELOPMENT OF HYPOTHESES IN ASTRONOMY 
Section 1. The Nature of an Hypothesis 
Tue last chapter, in dealing with the indispensable proc- 
esses of the careful observation of all phenomena that 
may have a bearing on the problem in hand, of their 
classification in such ways as seem most fruitful, and of 
thus providing the material for an accurate definition, 
was really an account of the method by which the 
trained scientific thinker seizes upon the first step in our 
analysis of the everyday act of reflective thought and 
elaborates upon it with all the resources at his com- 
mand. Although the type of diagnosis that we en- 
counter in modern medicine, dependent as it is upon the 
microscope, the culture dish, and all the rest of the ap- 
paratus of the laboratory, to say nothing of the carefully 
tabulated results of the experience of thousands of phy- 
sicians, may seem enormously different from the kind of 
analysis which we all bestow upon every problem whose 
solution demands real thinking, in the fundamental 
principles upon which it proceeds it is to be distin- 
guished therefrom only by its complexity and thorough- 
ness. We saw that this analysis was followed by the 
occurrence of one or more suggested solutions to the 
difficulty. In the history of science these suggestions are 
usually elaborate and complicated explanations of cer- 
tain observed phenomena, and are known as “‘hypoth- 
eses.” In the present chapter we shall examine two 
famous scientific hypotheses in the interest of finding 
out how a theory is formed to account for certain facts, 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  36 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
undergoes successive modifications as new facts are 
gradually brought to bear upon it, and then may have 
to give way to an entirely different theory if further 
facts are discovered with which it cannot be reconciled. 
How is a great hypothesis formulated by the labors of a 
whole series of investigators? What conditions must 
such an hypothesis fulfill if it is to be accounted as in all 
probability the true explanation? Why is one hypothe- 
sis, even though it possesses great plausibility, discarded 
in favor of another? In answering these questions we 
shall be discovering what the scientist has learned to be 
the greatest safeguards that can be thrown about the 
third stage in the typical act of reflective thinking. 
To illustrate these principles we have chosen from the 
field of astronomy the Copernican and Ptolemaic the- 
ories of planetary motion. It is appropriate that we 
make this selection, for astronomy was historically the 
first of the natural sciences to be developed, and the re- 
placement of the Ptolemaic theory by the Copernican is 
the intellectual event from which the birth of modern 
science is usually reckoned. The theory of Ptolemy was 
marvelously ingenious in the way in which it did explain 
the observed motions of the heavenly bodies, and the 
conflict between it and that of Copernicus was not a 
struggle between a poor and a good hypothesis, but be- 
tween a good hypothesis and one that proved to be even 
better. Few tales are more impressive than that of the 
long line of patient investigators who built stone by 
stone the vast edifice of modern astronomy.

Se firmly ingrained is our belief in the daily rotation 
of the earth upon its axis and its yearly revolution about

DEVELOPMENT OF HYPOTHESES 37 
the sun that it is extremely difficult to think ourselves 
back into the position of men to whom these explana- 
tions of the observed phenomena of the heavens had not 
occurred. But since we are to contrast our interpretation 
with another and quite different one, it will be well to 
start first with those facts which observation of the sky 
can actually establish. It is these facts which every hy- 
pothesis must explain; and it is by its accord with these 
facts that it must be ultimately tested. From the earli- 
est times men have observed the heavenly bodies and 
have kept some account of their changes in position. 
‘These records are the result of careful observations kept 
and corrected through long years. The Chaldean and 
Egyptian priests whose records we possess, however, for- 
mulated no theories as to the way in which the sun and 
the moon and the planets are related to each other and to 
the earth; they were seemingly content to tabulate and 
to note certain recurrent sequences of events like eclip- 
ses. They furnished a series of more or less unconnected 
items, usually marked and kept for some practical pur- 
pose, such as the fixing of religious festivals or the dat- 
ing of important political events. Even to-day Easter 
is fixed by reference to astronomical phenomena, and 
farmers still talk of planting in the dark of the moon. 
Just what are these facts which form the data of as- 
tronomy? A little thought will convince us that all that 
we can really see when we look at the heavens is a num- 
ber of spots of light, which appear from time to time in 
different directions from the earth, and which change 
their position with regard to each other. The varying di- 
rections of these light spots form the only immediate 
facts for the astronomer; his theories are all designed to 
account for the particular way in which these spots  
-P-A-G-E-46
  38 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
move about. Their size, their distance, their rate of 
movement — these are all items that cannot be directly 
observed, and that are based on inferences from the 
primary data. 
From earliest times men have classified these points 
of light into distinctive groups. They have picked out 
certain of them and given them the names of the fanci- 
ful figures which they seemed to resemble. Thus the 
Greeks named the constellations of the Great Bear, The 
Twins, Orion’s Belt. But another kind of classification, 
based not on this resemblance, but upon the kind of mo- 
tions which they performed, proved far more fruitful. 
For the sake of city dwellers who have forgotten the sky, 
let us list a few of the most important types of observ- 
able motion. 
First, the great body of so-called fixed stars, together 
with the sun and moon, appears to rotate about the 
earth once a day, rising in the east and setting in the 
west. To the unsophisticated observer, these heavenly 
bodies seem to be fixed upon the inside of a great spheri- 
cal surface of which the earth is the center, and the vast 
majority of them appear to possess no motion but this 
daily rotation about the earth. This apparent spherical 
surface upon which the spots of light which we call stars 
are seen is known to astronomy as the celestial sphere. 
The fixed stars receive their name because they remain 
always in the same position relative to each other, al- 
though of course when viewed from the earth they share 
in the rising and setting in which all the heavenly bodies 
participate. 
But certain of the light spots are not fixed, and change 
their positions with relation to the other stars. These 
are, besides the sun and the moon, those called planets

DEVELOPMENT OF HYPOTHESES 39 
or wanderers; and from the earliest times their courses 
amongst the fixed stars have been plotted with great 
care. Since the primary reason for theories of the solar 
system is to account for the seemingly irregular move- 
ments of these points of light, we shall have to note 
just what these courses appear to be.

celestial sphere, appears to lag behind it somewhat, so 
that it rises about fifty minutes later every day. In the 
course of approximately a month, it has traversed a 
complete circle about the sky, and the celestial sphere 
has gained upon it one entire rotation. Though it is not 
so easily observed, the sun also travels in a great circle 
around the sky, losing four minutes upon the fixed stars 
each day, so that at the end of a year it has returned once 
more to the same relative position. These two courses 
are quite regular, but the planets, while in general per- 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  40 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
forming similar circles from west to east that require 
greater or less time, seem to possess a much more erratic 
motion. At times their progress from west to east 
gradually slackens and stops, and they then seem to re- 
trace their steps for a period from east to west. Soon 
they again seem to slow up, stop, and then return once 
more upon their normal course from west to east. The 
accompanying diagram shows the apparent course of the 
planet Jupiter among the fixed stars on the celestial 
sphere during a period of about a year. (See Figure 1.) 
These are the chief motions of the heavenly bodies 
which the various theories of the relation between the 
members of the solar system are designed to explain: 
the daily rotation about the earth, the more extended 
courses of the sun, moon, and planets around the sur- 
face of the celestial sphere, and the backward or retro- 
grade motions of the planets. There are various minor 
movements which the great accuracy of modern tele- 
scopes is able to detect, and some of these minute varia- 
tions in direction shared even by the fixed stars will be 
noted later for their importance in deciding between the 
theories of Ptolemy and of Copernicus. 
Section 3. Ptolemy’s Hypothesis 
The first attempt at the systematic ordering of these 
observations was made in the second century B.c. by a 
Greek named Hipparchus. Following his lead, in the 
second century a.p., Ptolemy at Alexandria wrote a 
treatise which has come down to us under the title of 
the “Almagest.” He took the accumulated teachings 
of his predecessors and made from them what he called 
“a great’?! or “a mathematical composition.” He

-P-A-G-E-49
DEVELOPMENT OF HYPOTHESES 41 
placed the earth as an unmoving sphere at the center 
of things. The spherical character of the earth he ac- 
cepted from his predecessors. Pythagoras, or at least 
his followers, had believed it, on what grounds we do not 
know. ‘The earth was at the center of the heavens be- 
cause “heavy bodies descend to the center of the heay- 
ens, which is the center of the earth,” and because if the 
earth were not in the center “‘one side of the heavens 
would appear nearer to us than the other and the stars 
would be larger there.” The earth was immovable 
because there must be ‘‘some fixed point to which the 
motion of others may be referred,” and because, ‘‘if 
there were motion, it would be proportionate to the 
great mass of the earth and would leave behind animals 
and objects thrown into the air.” 
Around the earth there circled the moon, the sun, and 
the planets, and outside of all was the sphere in which 
were fixed the stars, which was thought of by Ptolemy 
as an actual sphere. These circlings were not at quite 
the same rate; the stars rotated fastest, then the plan- 
ets, the sun, andthe moon. This slight gain of the stars 
upon the other heavenly bodies accounted for their 
apparent paths among the stars. Ptolemy explained 
the irregular retrograde motions of the planets by a sim- 
ple and ingenious method. While the sun and moon 
circled about the earth directly, the planets really took 
part in two circular movements. An imaginary point 
on a planet’s great circle, called the ‘‘deferent,” did 
travel regularly about the earth, but at the same time 
the planet itself was revolving in a smaller circular orbit 
about this imaginary point. The center of this smaller 
circle traveled west to east at a uniform rate, but the 
planet itself was revolving about this center. Its ap-
-P-A-G-E-50
  42 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
parent path was thus a combination of the two circular 
movements. Figure 2 will make this clear. It shows 
both the large orbit, or deferent, and the smaller orbit, 
or epicycle, and the consequent epicycloid path of the 
planet. By comparing his figure with Figure 1, it will 
be seen how, if we assume that the epicycle orbit is 
  Ficurn 2. A Praner’s Motion in Tae Epicycie 
(From Todd, New Astronomy, American Book Company.) 
The center, c, of the small circle, called the “‘epicycle,”’ moves round 
the center # of the large circle, called the “‘deferent”; and at the end of 
each 24th part of a revolution, it occupies successively the points 1, 2, 3, 
4, 5, and so on. But while ¢ is moving to 1, the point ais traversing an 
arc of the deferent equal to a:, b;. By combination of the two motions, 
therefore, the point @ will traverse the heavy curve, reaching the points 
indicated by b1, be, bs, bs, bs, when c arrives at corresponding points 1, 2, 
8,4, 5. In passing from be to by the planet will turn backward, or seem 
to describe its retrograde arc among the stars. By combining different 
rates of motion with circlesof different sizes, it was found that all the ap- 
parent movements of the planets could be almost perfectly explained.
-P-A-G-E-51
    
DEVELOPMENT OF HYPOTHESES 43 
slightly tilted from the plane of the deferent orbit, the 
apparent path viewed from the earth would correspond 
to the observed course of Mercury. It should be noted 
that Figure 1 represents what can be seen when look- 
ing along the plane of the orbits, while Figure 2 repre- 
sents the orbits looked at perpendicularly from above. 
(See Figure 2.) 
In taking this position, Ptolemy apparently did not 
assert that he was picturing a real system. His interest 
seemingly was in calculating and predicting the posi- 
tions of the planets on the celestial sphere, rather than 
in portraying an actual relationship among heavenly 
bodies. He generally begins the theory of a particular 
fact of a planet’s motion by saying, ‘‘Let us imagine a 
circle,” and in the introduction to his Hypotheses he 
says: ‘‘I do not profess to be able thus to account for all 
the motions at the same time; but I shall show that each 
by itself is well explained by its proper hypothesis.” It 
is interesting to know that, though it is now held to be 
quite false, if considered an objective picture of things, 
it is still possible to base exact calculations and predic- 
tions verifiable by experience on this system, elaborated 
in accord with its own fundamental conceptions. Ptol- 
emy’s system was thoroughly scientific, in that it started 
from observed facts and assumed nothing that could not 
be tested by comparison with those facts. It forms a 
great contrast, for example, with the somewhat similar 
system propounded by Aristotle and elaborated during 
the late Middle Ages, which regarded each of the seven 
bodies, moon, Mercury, Venus, sun, Mars, Jupiter, and 
Saturn, as fixed in a great actual sphere of crystal, the 
whole series being included in an outer opaque sphere 
to which were attached the stars, and by whose move-
-P-A-G-E-52
  44 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
ments the whole eight concentric spheres were kept ro- 
tating. Such a fanciful conception had obviously lit- 
tle but superficial similarity to the scientific theory of 
Ptolemy. 
Why do we admire this system and call Ptolemy a 
great scientist? He taught a theory long since dis- 
carded and fixed human opinion in incorrect views for 
thirteen hundred years! 
1. He was great because he looked for natural expla- 
nations. All of the movements were accomplished by 
reference to orderly and well-known types of physical 
behavior, which were subject to study at will. No mys- 
terious and arbitrary power came into his system at any 
point to help him out of some unmastered difficulty — 
he did not assume the existence of anything whose oper- 
ation could not be observed and verified. 
2. He was great because he could understand and 
hold an enormous number of items of information and 
beliefs and compose them into an harmonious system. 
As a work of the scientific imagination his creation is 
superb. Such achievements bring with them a sense of 
mastery and security in a world where before no order 
seemed torule. Such systems may, indeed, give a false 
sense of finality by reason of their seductive complete- 
ness. They may stifle further inquiry. In spite of all 
this, they do not fail to call forth admiration from those 
who comprehend them. 
3. He was great because he could construct hypothe- 
ses conforming to a single type, to meet his phenomena, 
and clearly recognize them as working formulas. His 
hypotheses were assumptions made to aid in solving 
problems. They served their purpose if they were of use 
in this way. Ptolemy did not demand that, in addition,
-P-A-G-E-53
DEVELOPMENT OF HYPOTHESES 45 
they should be hypothetical constructions of natural 
conditions. In his one-sided adoption of hypotheses he 
illustrates one of the enduring uses of scientific suppo- 
sitions, but he also shows his limitations. 
4. He possessed remarkable mathematical ability and 
ingenuity in several particular solutions, which for the 
sake of simplicity are not given here. 
Ptolemy lacked instruments of exact observation, 
and, as noted above, he seems not to have been troubled 
by the question: ‘‘Is this system actually a real picture 
of the universe?’’ Such a question is vital when the be- 
lief is concerned with physical objects. In addition, 
Ptolemy did not seem to be offended by the need of 
complicating his explanations. 
Section 4. The Conflict of Authoritarian and Scientific 
Explanations 
In contrast to Ptolemy’s close hold on observation 
and theory conforming to nature, there may be cited the 
position of one of his critics, who started not from na- 
ture, but from an uncritical acceptance of a dogma — 
an inflexible and unexamined belief. 
A Syrian bishop of the fifth century, in attacking the 
theories of the heathen, wrote that “the heaven is not 
a sphere, but a tent or tabernacle; ‘it is He... that 
stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth 
them out as a tent to dwell in’; the Scripture says that it 
has a top, which a sphere has not, and it is also written: 
‘The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came unto 
Zoar.’ The earth is flat, and the sun does not pass un- 
der it in a night, but travels through the northern parts 
‘as if hidden by a wall,’”’ and he quotes: ‘‘The sun go- 
eth down and hasteth to his place where he ariseth.”
-P-A-G-E-54
46 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
Such a reliance upon the Scripture accepted literally as 
determining the details of all beliefs, we think of as an 
improper use of authority in determining opinion. It 
seizes upon a generalization that is, to be sure, based 
upon a certain number of observed facts, and applies 
that provisionally acceptable theory uncritically, with- 
out recognizing the modifications which new facts must 
introduce. It is a characteristic prejudice of the human 
mind to cling thus tenaciously to an old view even in the 
face of broader knowledge. Thus it is interesting to 
note that when finally the Ptolemaic theory was ac- 
cepted by the Church, it too became an unquestioned 
criterion for all other doctrines, and its authority was 
called in to confound the new system of Copernicus. 
Section 5. The Hypothesis of Copernicus 
The system of Ptolemy was not subject to serious dis- 
pute until Copernicus (1473-1548) issued his De revolu- 
tionibus orbvum celestium. Copernicus was a Pole, ed- 
ucated in mathematics and in astronomy at Cracow and 
in Italy. In his writing he tells how he was first induced 
to seek for a new theory of the heavenly bodies by find- 
ing that mathematicians differed greatly among them- 
selves about the earth’s motion. He therefore took the 
trouble to read the writings of the ancients. He found 
a statement that Hiketas had believed the earth to be in 
motion. “‘Occasioned thus,’ he wrote, ‘I also began to 
think of a motion of the earth, and although the idea 
seemed absurd, still, as those before me had been per- 
mitted to assume certain circles in order to explain the 
motions of the stars, I believed it would readily be per- 
mitted me to try whether, on the assumption of the mo- 
tion of the earth, better explanation of the revolutions 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
DEVELOPMENT OF HYPOTHESES AY 
of the heavenly spheres might not be found. And thus 
I have, assuming the motions which I in the following 
work attribute to the earth, after long and careful inves- 
tigation, finally found that when the motions of the 
other planets are referred to the circulation of the earth, 
and are computed for the revolution of each star, not only 
do the phenomena necessarily follow therefrom, but the 
order and magnitude of the stars and all their orbs and 
the heaven itself are so connected that in no part can 
anything be transposed without confusion to the rest 
and to the whole universe.’ ”’ 
His work had indeed been long — it began in 1506 
and was written out only in 1531 or 1532. He states 
that “‘‘the world has the form of a sphere, the most per- 
fect as well as the most roomy figure, which everything 
tends to assume as we may see in drops of water and 
other fluids.’ ‘The motion of the heavenly bodies is 
circular or a composition of circular motions, since only 
a circle can bring a body back to its original position. 
The question of the rest or movement of the earth can- 
not be considered settled since any change observed 
may be caused either by a motion of the object observed 
or by that of the observer, or by a different motion of 
both; so that if the earth had a motion it would produce 
an apparent motion of everything outside it in the op- 
posite direction.’”’ ‘To Ptolemy’s argument that a ro- 
tation in twenty-four hours would be so violent a motion 
that the loose earth would long ago have been scattered 
over the heavens while falling bodies would never reach 
the place intended, as the latter would have been torn 
away from under them, and clouds and other bodies in 
the air would always be moving toward the west, Co-

that the immense heavenly sphere would fly asunder; 
and as to the clouds we have only to assume that not 
only the earth and water, but also a considerable portion 
of the air rotate, whether the reason be that the lower 
layers, mixed with earthy and watery matter, are of the 
same nature as the earth, or that the friction with the 
earth makes the air partake of the earth’s rotation.” 
Copernicus next asserts that the earth is not the cen- 
ter of all circular motions, since the planets vary in their 
distance from the earth. The planets do, in fact, move 
around the sun, and so, too, the earth. The irregulari- 
ties of the movements of the planets are not real but 
apparent phenomena, caused by the fact that the earth 
itself is in motion. 
Copernicus in the course of his writing proceeds to 
work out the revolutions of the planets on these assump- 
tions, and rests his case on the possibility of this proced- 
ure. He does not, however, avoid the use of epicycles 
to account for irregularities, though he does decrease 
the number required for his computations. He is con- 
fronted with the difficulty, however, that his system lacks 
a certain harmony, since he is unable to solve the ir- 
regularities found in a single planet by two epicycles both 
of which can at the same time be thought of as really ex- 
istent. That is, he is still forced to assume epicycles as 
_ hypothetical entities to enable him to account for excep- 
tions in his system. 
How, specifically, does the Copernican theory ac- 
count for the planetary movements? Whereas Ptolemy 
had to place an extra circular motion or epicycle in the 
course of each planet, to explain their retrograde move- 
ments, Copernicus saw that these movements could be 
much more easily interpreted by putting a single circu-

lar motion in the path of the earth. The retrogression 
thus becomes an apparent one only, and is easily ex- 
plained as due to the fact that the earth is at that time 
moving more rapidly than the planet and overtaking it.

Refer to the figure. The largest ellipse, ABCD, is the 
ecliptic. Intermediate ellipse is orbit of an exterior 
planet; and smallest ellipse is the path of earth itself. A 
planet when advancing always moves in direction GH. 
The sun is at S. When earth is successively at points 
marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, on its orbit, the outer planet is 
at the points marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, on the middle el- 
lipse; so that the planet is seen projected upon the sky 
in the directions of the several straight lines. These in- 
tersect the zone F, G, H, J, of the celestial sphere in the 
points also marked upon it 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and among 
the stars of the zodiac. Following them in order of num- 
ber, it is evident that the planet advances from 1 to8, 
retrogrades from 3 to 5, and advances again from 5 to 7. 
Also its backward motion is most rapid from 3 to 4, 
when the planet is near opposition, and its distance 
from earth is the least possible. In general, the nearer 
the planet to earth, the more extensive its loop.

50 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
The teachings of this sixteenth-century astronomer 
are often referred to as the Copernican revolution, and 
from them we date the birth of the modern intellectual 
spirit. ‘Tremendous as was the genius involved in find- 
ing a new path through the perplexities of heavenly mo- 
tions, Copernicus did not prove by any physical experi- 
ments that the earth did revolve on its axis and around 
the sun. His system was a brilliant hypothesis, sim- 
pler than Ptolemy’s, and equally comprehensive. In this 
greater simplicity consists one of the chief claims of this 
system to scientific praise, for the scientist is constantly 
seeking for that explanation which will meet all the facts 
with the least expenditure of assumption. Besides this, 
his theory was confirmed by the work of his successors, 
Galileo, Kepler, and Newton, each of whom added new 
observations, and new major theories which gave greater 
sweep to his creation, and eliminated the exceptions 
which he had been unable to master. He himself had 
doubted, been perplexed by contradictory theories, had 
started to try out a new initial assumption, and had 
found that the superstructure reared upon it corre- 
sponded closely — though he knew that it was not ex- 
actly — to the phenomena to be explained. It was a 
trial of a seemingly possible shift in basic principle and 
an example of tireless scrutiny of the consequences. 
In his ability to use the great tool of astronomical 
theory — mathematics — he equaled, but probably 
did not surpass Ptolemy; but he built a new system. 
Ptolemy organized an old one. His main concep- 
tions, furthermore, did, in years to come, fit into new 
discoveries when the assumptions of Ptolemy proved 
useless, _

DEVELOPMENT OF HYPOTHESES 51 
Section 6. Why Men accept the Heliocentric Hypothesis 
Although Copernicus had set up an alternative the- 
ory to the time-honored Ptolemaic description of the 
solar system, and had succeeded in the main in making 
it fit the observed facts about the successive positions 
occupied by the heavenly bodies, he had not offered any 
direct proof that his hypothesis was true while that of 
Ptolemy was false. Nevertheless, he was firmly con- 
vinced of its truth himself, and despite the fact that 
no experimental proof was immediately forthcoming, 
within the next century the Copernican theory had been 
adopted by all the greatest astronomers. Why did 
these men throw overboard a firmly established theory 
and adhere to a new and daring hypothesis, seemingly 
utterly subversive of all that had been established in 
thought, when there was actually no decisive proof that 
the old theory was false or that the new theory was true? 
Unless we can understand their action, and the reasons 
for it, we shall not be able to understand much of that 
fabric of theories and hypotheses which goes to make up 
modern science. Nearly all of the marvelous advance 
we have made in solving the secrets of nature has been 
due precisely to this, that scientists have preferred one 
hypothesis to another, and by that preference, however 
unable it may have been to justify itself immediately on 
grounds of strict proof, have been led to many new dis- 
coveries of fact. 
Indeed, it is not usually recognized by the layman 
that even to-day it cannot be said that the Copernican 
theory has, strictly speaking, been proved true. It is 
still quite possible to explain all of the observed facts of 
astronomy by means of the Ptolemaic theory, although,
-P-A-G-E-60
    52 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
of course, that theory would have to be made much more 
complex by the introduction of new epicycles for each 
newly discovered celestial phenomenon. Nevertheless, 
probably no other scientific hypothesis is so universally 
accepted as the Copernican, and the astronomer who 
seriously upheld the Ptolemaic theory to-day would be 
regarded as an amusing crank. If this belief rests upon 
no conclusive proof, why do all scientists maintain it as 
almost axiomatic? In answering this question, we shall 
discover some extremely important things about the way 
in which the scientifically trained mind tests hypotheses. 
Although Copernicus did not attempt to disprove the 
Ptolemaic theory, he did work long and hard to show 
that his new hypothesis would explain all the observable 
facts. Had there been any planetary motions which it 
could not explain, while his predecessor’s theory could, 
obviously his theory would have been worthless. This 
is the first requisite of a good hypothesis, that it must be 
consistent with all the known facts; at least, with more 
of them than any rival theory. And when he had proved 
this of his heliocentric hypothesis, Copernicus was con- 
tent to leave to others the disproof of the old theory. 
Astronomers now had before them two hypotheses, 
both of which seemed able to account for all the ob- 
served motions of the stars. Obviously only one could 
be true. Hither the earth, together with the other plan- 
ets, went around the sun, or the sun and planets went 
around the earth — the motion being, of course, meas- 
ured in comparison with the fixed stars. Hence as- 
tronomers, in the absence of direct proof, were forced 
to choose one or the other, and they chose the simpler 
hypothesis. The greater simplicity of the Copernican 
system, which in its completed form got rid of all the
-P-A-G-E-61
DEVELOPMENT OF HYPOTHESES 53 
epicycles built upon epicycles, made calculated pre- 
dictions somewhat easier to work out; though, as a 
matter of fact, the actual reckoning is carried out by 
means of the same equations under either hypothesis. 
But, besides the practical advantage of facilitating com- 
putation, the human mind, and perhaps especially the 
mind of the scientist, feels that a simple explanation 
without undue complexities, one great formula that will 
comprehend an infinite series of phenomena, is more at- 
tractive, more beautiful, and, other things being equal, 
more apt to be true than one that is extremely involved. 
Perhaps this simplicity is inherent in the nature of 
things, and in seeking for it men are looking for what is a 
great truth about our universe. Many of the foremost 
thinkers would agree with Sir Isaac Newton when he 
says: ‘‘Nature does nothing in vain, and more is in vain 
when less will serve; for Nature is pleased with simplic- 
ity, and affects not the pomp of superfluous causes.” * 
Perhaps this desire for simplicity is rather a characteris- 
tic trait of the mind of man than the result of the experi- 
ence of nature; certainly with increased facilities for ob- 
servation we are often forced to recognize that facts are 
much more complex than we had hoped. Whatsoever 
its foundation, however, this craving for the simple is of 
the utmost importance in scientific thinking. It is gen- 
erally known as the ‘‘Law of Parsimony,’’ and can be 
formulated, If two hypotheses each account equally for 
all the observed facts, the simpler one — that is, the one 
which makes the fewer assumptions —is to be preferred 
to the more complex. And it was largely because of 
the principle so expressed that the Copernican system 
gained such rapid and complete dominance. 
1 Newton, Principia, Book m1.
-P-A-G-E-62
  54 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
Naturally, however, astronomers were eager to find 
some more conclusive demonstration of the correctness 
of the Copernican theory. Did both hypotheses explain 
equally all the observed facts? The apparent motions 
of all the members of the solar system could be calcu- 
lated and predicted with almost equal facility under 
both theories. Could men discover certain motions in 
the fixed stars that would furnish a final proof? Two 
courses were open. One could proceed to elaborate 
each theory, to see what further consequences each 
would imply if it were true, and then to investigate 
whether these further consequences actually did take 
place. Or one could observe some new fact that could 
not be satisfactorily accounted for by one of the theo- 
ries, and which would thus disprove it. These are the 
two ways in which all scientific hypotheses are subjected 
to scrutiny and testing. Whenever a new theory is pro- 
pounded, there is carried on this double process of elab- 
oration and development to discover its utmost possi- 
ble bearings, and of constant reference to the observable 
facts. If it be true, then such and such things must fol- 
low. Do they? Such and such phenomena are ob- 
served. Does our theory explain them? In the natural 
sciences this first development is made possible largely 
by means of mathematical calculation. If such and such 
a theory is true, then these equations hold, and from 
them we can deduce other equations which lead to the 
following conclusion. If that conclusion prove correct 
in experiment, the original theory has been verified. In 
astronomy, the positions all the heavenly bodies would 
have to assume on the basis of the theory are calculated 
with great precision, and then the telescope is pointed to 
thosespotsin thesky to observe their presence orabsence. 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
  DEVELOPMENT OF HYPOTHESES ” 55 
Men at once saw that if the Copernican hypothesis 
were correct, and the earth did revolve about the sun, 
the stars would have to appear in different positions 
when viewed from different points in the earth’s orbit, 
just as when one walks around his dinner table the pic- 
tures upon the walls appear in different relation to each 
other. But no telescope in the sixteenth or seven- 
teenth century could reveal any change in the apparent 
positions of the fixed stars. This objection seemed to 
even the great Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) irreconcilable 
with the heliocentric hypothesis, and he formulated a 
system in which, although the planets went about the 
sun, the sun in turn, together with the starry sphere, ro- 
tated about the earth. The upholders of Copernicus re- 
plied that the stars were so exceedingly distant that the 
change in position of the earth in its orbit could make no 
discoverable difference in their apparent positions. But 
the fact that if the earth did revolve the stars should 
change their position, however slightly, and the fact 
that there was no discernible change, led men to investi- 
gate with the utmost precision in the hope of establish- 
ing this conclusive proof of the heliocentric hypothesis. 
It was not until 1838 that astronomical instruments 
became accurate enough to detect the extremely small 
variation in the apparent position of a star attributable 
to the earth’s motion. In that year Bessel measured the 
minute orbit which the star 61 Cygni seems to describe, 
and since then some fifty other stars have been found 
near enough to the earth to be affected by her move- 
ment. In explanation of the inability of the early in- 
vestigators to detect these tiny orbits, it can be said that 
that of 61 Cygni is as difficult to measure as a penny 
would be at a distance of three miles.
-P-A-G-E-64
  56 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
What had Bessel done? He had observed a fact 
which could be beautifully explained on the assumption 
that the earth moved. But could not the geocentric 
theory also explain such facts? Strictly speaking, it 
could take account of them; that is, one could still as- 
sume that the earth was immobile, but one would have 
to assume also that all of the stars whose displacement, 
had been observed had an annual motion of their own, 
and revolved in epicycles. Why should these motions 
be completed in just a year if they had no connection with 
the earth? On the Ptolemaic theory, these facts would 
have been accepted as unrelated; on the Copernican, 
they could be explained. 
Moreover, the English astronomer Bradley discov- 
ered an apparent motion in which each star participates 
that is attributed to the effect of the earth’s motion 
upon the light rays. This is too complicated to explain 
here, but suffice it to say that these millions of move- 
ments can all be beautifully understood on Copernicus’ 
theory, while on Ptolemy’s they are only to be accepted 
as brute and unintelligible facts. 
Had, then, the heliocentric theory been proved? In 
the sense in which astronomers can prove anything, yes. 
No one who by admitting the revolution of the earth 
could at one stroke understand and predict millions of 
other movements would refuse to admit it. Bessel’s 
and Bradley’s accomplishments were an example of the 
Law of Parsimony at its highest development, the sum- 
ming up of innumerable hitherto unrelated phenomena 
in one simple formula of explanation. And since that 
time various other movements of the heavenly bodies 
have been discovered which, though theoretically ad- 
mitting of explanation and calculation by the invention 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
DEVELOPMENT OF HYPOTHESES ° 57 
of millions of additional epicycles, can with infinitely 
greater ease and simplicity be shown to follow from the 
earth’s revolution. As our instruments have become 
more and more accurate, we have found more and more 
ways in which the motion of our earth affects the ap- 
parent positions of other bodies. 
Can we hope to receive confirmation of the Coperni- 
can theory in any more decisive way? Can we hope 
that we shall some day discover some new celestial mo- 
tion that no conceivable complexity of epicycles could 
explain? The mathematician tells us that we cannot, 
for in calculating astronomical positions we use only the 
algebraic functions of sine and cosine, and it can be 
proved mathematically that everything that can be 
calculated algebraically by the use of these terms can 
also be calculated geometrically by means of epicycles. 
Hence, so far as the computation of mere positions goes, 
Ptolemy could still, in theory, hold his own. It is possi- 
ble that some other phenomenon may be discovered that 
will add independent confirmation, and that we may be 
able to demonstrate the revolution of the earth as cer- 
tainly as we can its rotation, which now is definitely es- 
tablished as depending upon the laws of motion, and as 
being false only if they are false. Yet we must not for- 
get that so far at least the theory of the revolution of the 
earth about the sun is not a fact, but an hypothesis, an in- 
ference, and that in the last analysis it rests solely upon 
the Law of Parsimony. 
Section 7. The Fruitful Hypothesis 
There is still another most important reason for ac- 
cepting the heliocentric hypothesis. Where the geo- 
centric theory was utterly barren, the other proved
-P-A-G-E-66
  
  58 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
enormously fruitful. Ptolemy could always manage by 
inventing new epicycles to explain whatever new celes- 
tial motion might be discovered, but he could never pre- 
dict beforehand that with more accurate observations 
men would find those irregularities. His wisdom was 
the wisdom that is wise after the event. He could 
absorb the new knowledge into his scheme, but he 
proved quite unable to discover any new knowledge 
himself. His theory gave rise to no new suggestions and 
hypotheses. 
The Copernican theory, on the other hand, has sug- 
gested many possibilities which later have been experi- 
mentally verified.. It tells us what we may expect, 
instead of being profoundly surprised at each new ob- 
servation. It leads us on to the discovery of further 
knowledge. It is a signpost pointing out the road 
ahead, instead of a mere milestone to mark the dis- 
tance already traversed. A single noteworthy example 
will suffice to make this difference clear. 
In 1781 the planet Uranus was discovered, and after 
some observation its orbit was plotted and calculations 
as to its future position made, based upon the heliocen- 
tric theory and the gravitational theory of Newton. By 
1820 there were noted discrepancies between its calcu- 
lated and its observed position; by 1840 these had be- 
come intolerable. Some other element not included in 
the computation was affecting Uranus’ motion. What 
would the Ptolemaic system have done in such a case? 
It would have recognized the fact, and added another 
epicycle as the explanation. What did the astronomers 
who adhered to the Copernican theory do? Assuming 
that Uranus was one of a number of planets revolving 
about the sun, they further assumed that the discrepan-
-P-A-G-E-67
    DEVELOPMENT OF HYPOTHESES 59 
cies were due to the attraction of another and unknown 
planet. Still working upon the heliocentric theory and 
the Newtonian laws of motion, Adams and Leverrier 
computed the probable course of the unknown planet if 
it were to exert such force upon Uranus. When their 
figuring was finished, Galle turned his telescope upon 
that particular spot in the heavens, and there he beheld 
a new planet, since named Neptune. There had been 
made one of the most dramatic discoveries in the history 
of science. What would the Ptolemaic system have 
said to the new planet? It could have proceeded to fit 
it out with the requisite epicycles, when once it had been 
discovered, but it could in no wise have contributed 
to that discovery. It would have remained unfruitful 
while its rival added directly to our knowledge. 
Section 8. The Marks of a Good Hypothesis 
In the Copernican theory we thus have a scientific be- 
lief which, though not a fact, in the sense that it can be 
directly ascertained by simple observation, as though 
from a distant star we could actually watch the earth go- 
ing round the sun, is yet as firmly established as any 
scientific inference can well be. Any hypothesis in the 
field of science which is distinguished from a rival hy- 
pothesis as the Copernican is marked off from the Ptol- 
emaic theory would be regarded as equally certain and 
true. Let us recapitulate those marks. 
In the first place, the heliocentric theory enables us to 
predict what will occur in the future with the utmost 
nicety. Astronomers are able to formulate beliefs about 
the movements of the heavenly bodies which are veri- 
fied as completely as any in the physical sciences. Their 
planetary hypothesis thus performs the essential work 
of prediction for which it was devised.  
-P-A-G-E-68
  60 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
Secondly, the heliocentric theory explains the move- 
ments observed among the stars as the geocentric theory 
does not. It explains every cyclic motion that is com- 
pleted in a year as dependent upon a single simple factor, 
the movement of the earth. A theory which requires a 
new explanation for each motion can hardly be said to 
explain anything at all, for it does not succeed in reduc- 
ing what is complex to what is more simple. Hence, 
while Ptolemy could perhaps enable us to predict the 
small variations in the positions of the stars, he could 
never enable us to understand them as all following from 
some other occurrence. Moreover, the simplicity re- 
sulting from this economy of assumption facilitates our 
calculations. It also appeals to the human mind as a 
precious quality of intellectual beauty; were astronomy 
still Ptolemaic, it would probably have long since ceased 
to occupy the place of the most elevating of all the sci- 
ences. As it is, its marvelous simplicity furnishes many 
with an esthetic enjoyment unequaled in human ex- 
perience. 
Thirdly, the heliocentric theory has proved to be 
highly suggestive, an opportunity rather than a com- 
pleted achievement. It has proved easily congruous 
with other scientific discoveries, notably the whole of 
Newtonian mechanics. It seems to give us a real insight 
into the essential structure of our planetary system, and 
to be, as no other system is, the key to unlock its further 
secrets. If nature be the great riddle, Copernicus seems 
. to have come very close to part of the answer. He has 
found a successful key, and we cannot help but think 
it must be the true one. 
These are the marks of a good scientific hypothesis. 
We have traced the way in which such theories rise and
-P-A-G-E-69

are elaborated and modified as the discovery of new 
facts, made possible by improved means of observa- 
tions, reveals the insufficiency of the old notions. In 
the next chapter we shall examine more in detail the ac- 
tual processes by which the scientist formulates an hy- 
pothesis, and the careful tests he has devised for guard- 
ing against the possibility of error.

  ‘CHAPTER IV 
THE METHODS OF EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE: THE 
DISCOVERY OF CAUSAL RELATIONS IN BIOLOGY 
Section 1. The Significance of Causal Relations 
“Happy is the man who knows the causes of things,” 
says the poet, and it is precisely this understanding 
which has seemed to many to be the fulfillment of all in- 
tellectual endeavor. To know the causes of things and 
their effects is to gain a sense of security in the fuller 
comprehension of past events, and the power of envisag- 
ing and perhaps guiding them in the future. 
We have seen how the scientist in the field of medi- 
cine gains an understanding of his subject by observing 
certain fundamental similarities in the cases which he is 
called upon to treat, and how the astronomer advances 
by considering the relation of numerous celestial changes 
to some significant occurrence in the heavens. But it 
was clear that the purpose of the physician and the as- 
tronomer is not merely to observe symptoms and events, 
or even to relate them to other happenings by pointing 
out resemblances or temporal sequences. 
For when we speak of diagnosis and of the construc- 
tion of an hypothesis, we are really concerned with what 
caused the appearance of certain symptoms and what 
effect a definite remedy will have, or we inquire into 
the cause of a comet’s path and the effects of the sun’s 
position. If we know the answers to questions such as 
these, we have truly penetrated deep into the mysteries 
of nature. When we realize what is meant by these
-P-A-G-E-72
  64 REFLECTIVE THINKING - 
terms ‘‘cause”’ and ‘‘effect,”” we shall see why the dis- 
covery of causal relationships in different fields of knowl- 
edge is so important a step in scientific progress. 
The usefulness of this discovery is apparent in the proc- 
ess of verification which we noted as being an important 
step in our analysis of a typical act of reflective think- 
ing. It is in this connection especially that we shall 
study the meaning of scientific experimentation. We 
shall have occasion to notice that experimentation is 
not, what it sofrequently seems to the uninitiated to be— 
fooling in a more or less haphazard way with a variety 
of materials; but that it is, commonly, the method by 
which the scientist tests the validity of an hypothesis 
formulated in accordance with the principles studied in 
the last chapter. Having been led by observation and 
analysis to the tentative opinion that certain facts or 
events are the results of other facts or events, he sets to 
work to test this opinion. In doing this he relies, as has 
been said, chiefly on the above-mentioned conceptions 
of “cause” and “effect.” 
Though these conceptions are useful in all fields, it is 
perhaps evident that they are more readily applied in 
some than in others. You can more easily explain the 
cause of a severe headache than the cause of your affec- 
tion for a dear friend. It is simpler to discover the 
cause of the failure of your vegetable garden to yield all 
that you had hoped for than to find the cause of wide- 
spread business depression. Just what we mean when 
we say that the cause of the headache was that extra cup 
of coffee, or that the garden’s failure was the effect of in- 
sufficient rain, we shall have an opportunity to inquire 
later on. For the present, however, let us note that the 
establishment of causal relationships is easier in some
-P-A-G-E-73
  EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE ” 65 
cases than in others. Superficially it may appear, and 
it has often been said, that it depends to a great extent 
on the degree of complexity of the objects whose rela- 
tionship we happen to be studying. There is some basis 
for this explanation, however partial it be; though one 
may question whether to some extent those things 
which we understand do not therefore seem simple, 
whereas those which we fail to comprehend seem com- 
plex. In any case we are forced to realize that we do 
know more about the causes of electricity than about 
the causes of life, that the effects of sulphuric acid on 
zinc are better understood than are the effects of fright 
on an immature mind. 
However complex or simple these several relationships 
may be, our greater knowledge of some than of others un- 
doubtedly depends to a very large extent on our ability 
to demonstrate and test out our judgments about these 
relationships. When we can provide for the repetition 
of an event, such as the reaction of zinc to an acid, under 
controlled conditions, we can gain a greater understand- 
ing of what is taking place than when our powers of ob- 
servation are restricted as in the case of psychological in- 
fluences. By means of experimental investigation, our 
preliminary observations, even in very complex fields, 
are improved and corrected, and, as we perfect our 
methods of studying these subjects, we may reasonably 
hope to learn more about them, even about such com- 
plex subjects as the nature of life and the factors in men- 
tal development. The advance in various sciences has 
depended largely on the discovery of more applicable 
methods of experimentation whereby various theories 
might be tested and further facts secured for their subse- 
quent elaboration.

    66 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
In the following sections we shall trace the history of 
the biologist’s efforts to understand certain events; 
namely, the processes by which the individuals of va- 
rious species are generated. Are they all brought into 
the world by well-definable methods of reproduction, as 
the offspring of creatures similar to themselves? Or are 
they the unaccountable, spontaneous products of a form 
of nature fundamentally different from themselves? 
Questions such as these long puzzled the biologist. 
How were they to be answered? 
Section 2. “Spontaneous Generation” as the Origin of 
Life 
The natural scientist has always recognized that in 
most instances organisms are propagated by parents 
similar to the offspring. Another mode of generation, 
however, was formerly widely believed in. ‘‘Hetero- 
genesis,” the creation of a living organism out of inor- 
ganic matter, was generally accepted as another method. 
Animals as high in the scale of life as the frog were 
thought of as being in some cases the product of spon- 
taneous generation. Hels were said to have come into 
being suddenly from the slimy ooze of the river Nile, and 
caterpillars and many insects were supposed to be the 
spontaneous product of the leaves on which they fed. 
A formula for creating mice was even suggested; and it 
was shown that they could be procured by putting 
grains of wheat with some dirty linen in a receptacle, 
whereupon the mice would presently appear. Decay- 
ing meat was regarded especially as a source of sponta- 
neous generation of living matter. Worms and maggots 
were supposed to find their origin in putrefying flesh. 
An Italian, Francesco Redi, in the seventeenth cen- 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE 67 
tury, disproved the truth of this last example.’ Hs 
placed the meat in a receptacle over which he fastened a 
paper cover. The meat yielded no products. Chang- 
ing the cover, he put gauze over the meat through which 
the odor of the flesh could rise. Flies were attracted to 
it, laid their eggs on the gauze, and these developed 
upon it instead of on the meat. By such simple ex- 
periments as this the theory of spontaneous genera- 
tion gradually lost ground and might well have been 
vanquished altogether but for the invention of the 
microscope. 
It is a curious fact, not without parallel in other cases, 
that the development of this instrument led temporarily 
to the revival of an erroneous theory. The microscope, 
which has in so many directions advanced our under- 
standing of the world of nature, was the immediate 
cause of the revival of the theory of heterogenesis, for by 
its aid there were discovered innumerable tiny organ- 
isms invisible to the naked eye, but which lived and had 
their being and could now be observed. These micro- 
organisms, it was said, came spontaneously into being in 
any liquid, however free it had been from these infu- 
sions previously. For this reason these organisms were 
given the name of ‘‘Infusoria.’”’ The liquids in which 
these animalcule were generated were spoken of as 
“putrescible.” 
Many experiments were performed by the defenders of 
the theory of spontaneous generation to show that pre- 
viously sterile water generated life in this way and pos- 
sessed ‘vegetative force.” The question was the sub- 
ject of endless debate and much abstract speculation. 
The doctrine of spontaneous generation, mysterious 
though it was, appealed to simplicity-loving minds, and
-P-A-G-E-76
ee ee a ee ee 
68 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
the opposing views found it well-nigh impossible to 
substitute a convincing explanation. Moreover, the 
heterogenists pointed with assurance to innumerable 
“men of genius” from Aristotle down who had accepted 
their opinion. They regarded as ridiculous and fantas- 
tic any effort to discover how the swarm of minute crea- 
tures disclosed by the microscope could have entered the 
medium in which they were found. And they spoke with 
such assurance and conviction, and with such an array 
of erudition, that they seemed to carry the day by sheer 
enthusiasm. An earlier defender of the theory had 
written that ‘‘to question this view is to question rea- 
son, sense and experience”’; and the new converts to the 
doctrine failed to realize that that is precisely what wis- 
dom demands that we should do. Many ingenious sys- 
tems, such as that of Buffon, were set forth, and new 
and elaborate terminologies were invented to describe 
the phenomena: a frequent but a poor way to explain 
things. 
What was most needful was a mind which would 
frankly face the problem, locate the difficulty, and sug- 
gest some natural hypothesis susceptible of proof or 
disproof. What conditions are necessary before these 
living beings can appear? That question had to be 
answered. But the opposing theorists failed to suggest 
any method of testing their conclusions. Indeed, every 
one seemed to secure the very results which he had an- 
ticipated and desired. And when an opponent offered 
contrary testimony, his ‘‘error” could readily be as- 
signed to special causes of which he had failed to take 
account.

EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE 69 
  Section 8. Pasteur’s Investigations into the Origin of 
Living Beings 
It remained for a patient and open-minded investiga- 
tor to make a fresh start, to state his problem as simply 
as possible, to consider the implications of his statement, 
and to examine each of these in order to see which were 
relevant to the question and which were not. It was the 
great French biologist, Louis Pasteur, who in 1860 set 
about this laborious task. Not neglecting the testimony 
of the past, but refusing to accept without scrutiny the 
opinions even of ‘‘men of genius,” he was not afraid to 
consider any theory, however “‘ridiculous or fantastic” 
it might at first appear. Above all he conscientiously 
avoided jumping to conclusions; for whereas, as he him- 
self stated, it was impossible not to lean to some theory, 
he endeavored to hold it in suspended judgment and, 
“while marching forward to establish some new facts, 
sought arguments against himself and turned back to 
strengthen points which seemed yet weak.’’! 
“Can matter organize itself? Can living beings come 
into the world without having been preceded by beings 
similar to them?” Thus he stated his problem. Lo- 
cating the question more definitely, he asked himself 
whence the minute organisms which the microscope dis- 
closed in previously sterile liquids had come. Can these 
have come in from the air, and if so can they be there 
discovered? If such germs exist in the atmosphere, it 
should be possible to gather them from it, and to this 
attempt Pasteur first addressed himself. By drawing a 
current of air through a cotton filter, he found deposited 
on the latter germs and spores like those under consid- 
\Vallery-Radot, Life of Pasteur, p. 99. 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  70 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
eration. Had he then proved his point? No, for the 
cotton was itself an organic substance, and might there- 
fore have given rise to these organic particles. Pasteur 
substituted a mineral filter, asbestos, for the cotton, and 
again an air current left its deposit! 
But the heterogenists were ready with another ob- 
jection. If these germs exist in the air, they asked, why 
is the atmosphere not clouded with them, or are they, 
perchance, unevenly distributed, being thick at one 
point and rare at another? Such an arrangement 
seemed utterly ridiculous. But while they laughed, 
Pasteur set about his investigations, using specimens of 
air in different places to discover whether their effects 
were indeed uniform or different. In the streets of Paris, 
in his cellar laboratory, in country fields, and on Alpine 
glaciers Pasteur performed his tests. The results varied 
greatly, and upon completing these investigations he 
was led to formulate his belief that ‘‘the dusts sus- 
pended in atmospheric air are the exclusive origin, the 
necessary condition of life in infusions.” 
How could Pasteur justify so daring an hypothesis? 
Up to this point he had, as we have seen, merely discov- 
ered that the germs which he was studying could be 
found in the atmosphere, and this in varying degree. 
But, granting that the air contained germs, could it be 
shown that these invariably came from the air? Pred- 
ecessors of Pasteur had attempted to boil ‘‘putresci- 
ble” liquids in closed tubes, and had thus succeeded in 
destroying the living organisms which they contained. 
But their opponents insisted that the excessive heat had 
also changed the “‘ vegetative force” of the fluids. How 
could Pasteur demonstrate that the air was the cause 
of the appearance of life in previously sterilized water
-P-A-G-E-79
  EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE 71 
without apparently impairing the liquid and thus intro- 
ducing a new and perplexing problem? 
He did it by taking liquids sterilized in each case by 
the same method and showing that organic life ap- 
peared in certain flasks and not in others. Here is his 
own description of the experiment: 
I place a portion of the infusion into a flask with a long 
neck. . . . Suppose I boil the liquid and leave it to cool. After 
a few days mouldiness or animalcule will develop in the liq- 
uid. By boiling I destroyed any germs in the liquid or 
against the glass; but that infusion being again in contact 
with air, it becomes altered as all infusions do. Now suppose 
I repeat this experiment, but that before boiling the liquid I 
draw the neck of the flask into a point, leaving, however, its 
extremity open. ... Now the liquid of this second flask will 
remain pure.... What difference is there between these two 
vases? ... The only difference between them is this: in the 
first case the dusts suspended in air and their germs can fall 
into the neck of the flask and come into contact with the liq- 
uid, where they find appropriate food and develop. Thence 
microscopic beings. In the second flask, on the contrary, it is 
impossible, or at least extremely difficult, unless air is vio- 
lently shaken, that dusts suspended in air should enter the 
vase. They fall on its curved neck. 
This experiment is full of instruction. For this must be no- 
ticed, that everything in air save its dusts can easily enter the 
vase and come in contact with the liquid. .. . Only one thing 
cannot enter easily, and that is dusts suspended in air. And 
the proof of this is, that if I shake the vase violently two or 
three times in a few days it contains animalcule or mouldi- 
ness. Why? Because air has come in violently enough to 
carry dust with it. 
Could the heterogenists maintain that some of this liq- 
uid had ‘‘ vegetative force” which had been destroyed 
in the other flasks? Clearly not, for the liquid was iden- 
tical in all cases. The only varying factor was the dust-
-P-A-G-E-80
  72 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
laden air which was introduced in some and kept out of 
others, the former of which produced organic beings, 
while the latter remained sterile. 
We have here the secret of Pasteur’s method. He 
carefully controlled his conditions so that each factor 
could be considered. If the only changed condition 
was the change of atmosphere, then that change was, be- 
yond peradventure, to be regarded as the cause of the 
varying results. Moreover, as this precondition varied, 
the consequences varied similarly. The clear light of 
analysis had been thrown on the situation, and had re- 
vealed the origin of the living organisms. 
It may be noted that this discovery of Pasteur’s 
yielded far-reaching and significant results. His own 
work was to apply his new knowledge to the study of 
ferments, and these also he showed to be living beings, 
not yielded spontaneously as a matter of accident, but 
the product of entirely natural and controllable proc- 
esses. The tremendous progress in the investigation of 
disease which the last half-century has witnessed fol- 
lowed this work, with the isolation of specific germs and 
the consequent discovery of remedies. In two instances, 
anthrax and smallpox, Pasteur himself was the path- 
finder, but other scientists of all nations followed his 
lead. The marvelous advance in surgery and in meth- 
ods of sterilization associated with the name of Lord 
Lister, all owe their inspiration to this beginning. 
What had Pasteur proved? Before we go on to re- 
view in greater detail the processes by which he reached 
his conclusions, it is important to stop and consider pre- 
cisely what the results of his tests were. All too fre- 
quently at the conclusion of an argument it is by no 
means clear what has been proven. All too often the re-
-P-A-G-E-81
  EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE " 13 
sults of even a valid proof are vitiated by attempting to 
make it signify more than it really does. You prove that 
aman is thoroughly honest, which fact, if his good name 
has been questioned, may be a very important thing to 
do, and you thereupon jump to the conclusion that he - 
would make an excellent club treasurer, which requires , 
other qualifications in addition to honesty. Or you in- 
sist that you have symptoms of typhoid fever, which 
should, of course, require careful treatment and examina- 
tion, and you argue that it is therefore quite proper for 
you to be with your favorite brother who has the disease, 
since exposure will no longer endanger you. 
It is therefore desirable for us to ask: What had Pas- 
teur proved? Had he proved that all life is the effect of 
previous life, that ‘‘biogenesis” is universal and always 
has been? This view is held by numerous scientists, who 
either take an agnostic position as to the ultimate ori- 
gin of life on earth, or hold that living organisms were 
“created” at the same time as the inorganic world, or 
suggest that living cells drifted to the earth on “‘solar 
dust” from some other world where life existed pre- 
viously. But whichever of these views be valid or false, 
Pasteur’s investigations do not prove their truth or their 
falsity. Nor did he prove that life was always the re- 
sult of earlier life — though he did show that this was 
the case in those many instances where his opponents 
had advanced the occult explanation of ‘spontaneous 
generation.” He did not even demonstrate that organ- 
isms could not be produced synthetically from inorganic 
substances, or that this process was not taking place 
continually on this planet under favorable conditions. 
These questions remain to be answered. But Pasteur 
did prove beyond peradventure that the living micro-
-P-A-G-E-82
    4 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
organisms which he was studying, like other organisms 
with which we are familiar, had definite life histories, 
specific modes of generation ; that their presence was not 
due to unforeseeable, uncontrollable, mysterious proc- 
esses, but that they were the offspring of parents simi- 
lar to themselves which floated on the dusts of the air 
and were thus introduced into previously sterile liquids. 
We have seen how this discovery made possible an un- 
derstanding of the processes on which the appearance of 
these bacteria and similar organisms depend, and their 
increased cdntrol and uses. But, of course, though we 
speak of Pasteur’s proof of the nature and activity of 
these creatures, he had really only demonstrated certain 
facts concerning particular individual representatives of 
this type. What justified him in assuming that they 
were truly representative, and in proceeding from the 
facts which he had observed to the generalized statement 
which made these facts significant? 
Section 4. The Experimental Methods 
It is this process whereby the investigator is enabled 
to go from the restricted individual case which he has 
studied to a generalized conclusion concerning all such 
cases, which we must now consider in detail. This 
transition from particular facts to a general knowledge 
about these facts is known as the ‘‘process of induc- 
tion.’ It is, of course, involved in other stages of re- 
flection which we have studied in earlier chapters. It 
assists the diagnostician in determining what facts it is 
important for him to observe and in classifying those 
facts. The tremendous advance from collected data to 
an hypothesis about these facts has itself sometimes 
been referred to as the ‘‘inductive leap,” and it is indeed
-P-A-G-E-83
  EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE 15 
an enormous “‘jump.” And again, as we have seen in 
the case of Pasteur, the experimental scientist endeav- 
ors to perform certain tests which will lead him to verify 
his hypothesis by linking it close to the facts which 
he wishes to comprehend. Thus the whole system of 
reflective thinking is an almost continuous process for- 
ward and back from the facts to be explained to the hy- 
pothesis or theory which embraces them. In this way 
the mind of an intelligent man is forever turning from 
the things which he observes to a fuller understanding 
of these things, from his theory back to the facts which 
are illuminated and clarified thereby. In studying 
these processes of reciprocal reference from hypothesis 
to experience and from experience to a more adequately 
established theory, we will consider the widely used 
methods of experimental science. 
What, then, is the significance of those methods so 
fruitfully employed by the experimental scientist? 
How can he safely go from his observations to his gen- 
eralizations? How could Pasteur, on the basis of a few 
selected experiments, say that these proved that micro- 
organisms did not appear in “‘putrescible”’ liquids as an 
effect of the “vegetative force’’ of these liquids, but that 
their appearance was caused by the introduction and 
propagation of germs carried as floating matter in the 
air? 
Let us see first what determines the selection of cer- 
tain experiments as being crucial and convincing. A 
plausible hypothesis has arisen in the mind of the inves- 
tigator: what experiments shall he perform to test it? 
Clearly he will not manipulate his materials at random, 
he will not use the primitive, ‘‘monkeying,” method of 
trial and error. He will rather consider just what will
-P-A-G-E-84
  76 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
prove or disprove his hypothesis. ‘If I am right,” 
Pasteur in effect said to himself, ‘then, whenever the 
germ-bearing atmospheric dusts are present, micro- 
organisms will propagate in these liquids; whenever 
they are not present, the liquids will remain sterile. I 
must try it out to see if this is the case.” 
What is needed in all such cases is a full analysis of the 
circumstances under consideration. The investigator 
requires an exhaustive list of all the factors which may 
possibly be determining the processes which he is study- 
ing. How inclusive this list must be in order to be re- 
garded as genuinely exhaustive of all the possibilities, it 
is difficult to say. Much will inevitably depend on the 
skill of the investigator and on the obscurity of the 
events which he is analyzing. The hope held forth by 
Bacon in his Novum Organum of a ‘‘fool-proof” method 
which would ‘‘leave little to the acuteness and strength 
of wit” of the investigator seems to overlook the fact 
that in the enumeration of factors to be considered the 
training and insight of the scientist are of the greatest 
importance. It is evident that a really complete enu- 
meration of all the circumstances involved would be 
beyond attainment. Indeed when we stop to consider 
that the purpose of such an enumeration is to make pos- 
sible the testing of these various factors and the elim- 
ination of those which are definitely not operative, we 
see that a list, unnecessarily long, would by no means be 
desirable. The methods which we are about to study 
serve to suggest what factors may be regarded as espe- 
cially significant, and, when the situation has been sub- 
jected to this analysis, to make possible the elimination 
of those which in all probability are not the cause or 
causes sought.  
-P-A-G-E-85
  EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE 7 
This analysis is the basis of all experimentation: if 
this fact a is really the cause of this event b, then we must 
try to see if whenever a occurs b inevitably also occurs, 
and if whenever a is absent b fails to occur. It must be 
borne in mind that, whereas a and b are simple symbols, 
the events which they signify are complex and involved. 
Thus it is by no means an easy thing to discern the 
cause a. What we see is rather a total situation a, of 
which some aspect or part, a), d2, @3,... may be the sig- 
nificant factor. It is therefore essential that our enu- 
meration of these parts be adequate so as to include the 
relevant factor a in the total situation. The methods 
which are to be discussed aim to identify this factor. An 
extended analysis of this basis of the methodology of 
experiment has keen made by the British philosopher, 
John Stuart Mill, and we shall follow his classic discus- 
sion.! He distinguishes five methods which he found in 
actual use among men of science, and summarizes them 
in five famous ‘‘Canons.” ? 
1J. 8. Mill, System of Logic, Book 3. 
2 A familiar device by which to illustrate symbolically the use of the 
various experimental methods is seen in the following scheme: 
If a set of circumstances a, b, c, d is followed by the result R, and an- 
other set of circumstances a, x, y, z is followed by the result R, then the 
circumstance a is causally related to the result R. This represents the 
Method of Agreement. 
  Similarly, if i020) GiiG, aie k dee gee a R 
and GeO OO pes8 bei tings S095 
then the circumstance b is causally related to the result R.

then not a but d is causally related to R. (Joint Method.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  78 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
1. The Canon of the Method of Agreement is stated 
by Mill in this way: If two or more instances of the phe- 
nomenon under investigation have only one circumstance 
in common, the circumstance in which alone all the in- 
stances agree ts the cause of the given phenomenon. ‘This 
has been more simply, though negatively, stated by a 
recent writer,! who says that ‘‘ Nothing is the cause of a 
phenomenon in the absence of which it nevertheless oc- 
curs.” Let us, in order to understand the uses and im- 
plications of this method, see how it was applied in 
Pasteur’s work. 
When his opponents objected that the filter used by 
Pasteur was itself an ‘‘organic” substance, and might 
therefore produce the micro-organisms, he simply 
changed the nature of filter substance, using the min- 
eral asbestos. The point of this change was, of course, 
that the material used for the filter was irrelevant and 
was not the cause of the germs which appeared on it, 
but that the atmospheric dusts which were caught by 
either filter were the cause. Again, in the subsequent 
experiments Pasteur held that if the germs were pro- 
duced when the dust-laden air was brought in contact 
with the liquids, and if no other factors were common 
to all cases, the air or some factor connected with the 
air would be shown to be the cause of the appearance 
of the living beings. 
We must recognize that the strict requirements of this 
method were not, and really could not be, observed in 
either of these instances. Many other factors were com- 
mon to all tests in addition to the condition of the air. 
In a sense it may, indeed, be questioned whether this 
method can ever be employed with absolute precision.

EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE 19 
For will not some feature remain common to any test, 
some feature which just because it is so common es- 
capes attention and is nevertheless of great importance? 
For example, the effects of gravitation are constantly 
present, and the success of numerous investigations has 
been seriously impaired by the failure to take this into 
account as a common factor in the several instances. 
However, though we must remember these deficiencies 
in the application of the method of agreement, its prac- 
tical usefulness in suggesting a solution when the com- 
mon factor is somewhat unusual and in the elimination 
of supposed ‘‘causes’”’ (the cotton filter, for instance) is 
very great. Whereas it cannot prove what is the cause 
of a phenomenon, it can be used to show that certain 
assumed ‘‘causes” are not genuinely so. Other diffi- 
culties which the method of agreement shares, more or 
less, with the other experimental methods will be noted 
below. 
2. The second method, called by Mill the ‘‘Method of 
Difference,’”’ is rather more readily applicable to the 
laboratory conditions of experimental investigation. 
Mill phrased the canon of this method thus: Jf an in- 
stance in which the phenomenon under investigation occurs 
and an instance in which it does not occur, have every cir- 
cumstance in common save one, that one occurring only in 
the former; the circumstance in which alone the two in- 
stances differ is the effect, or the cause, or an indispensable 
part of the cause of the phenomenon. Again, to cite a 
simpler expression of this method phrased negatively, it 
may be said that ‘‘nothing is the cause of a phenomenon 
in whose presence the phenomenon fails to occur.” 
It is this test which the experimenter uses when, care- 
fully controlling the conditions of his investigation, he 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
    80 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
seeks to eliminate some supposedly significant factor in 
order to see precisely what influence this will have on 
the whole procedure. In the case of Pasteur’s re- 
searches, we saw how he prepared a series of vessels un- 
der identical conditions filled with the same sterilized 
liquid, but constructed so that the air could enter some, 
but not the others. The fact that the bacteria subse- 
quently appeared in the former and not in the latter (or 
in the latter only after air had been forcibly injected by 
shaking) justified the conclusion that the circumstance 
in which alone the two sets differed — i.e., the entry of 
the air — was the cause of the varying result. 
It might, of course, be objected that the two sets of 
flasks were not, and could not possibly be, absolutely 
alike in all circumstances save the one referred to. No 
two things can be identical in this sense; the flasks stood 
in slightly different positions; they were not filled at pre- 
cisely the same moment nor in just the same manner; 
they were not originally manufactured in exactly the 
same way, and so forth. Of course we would be in- 
clined to dismiss all of these ‘‘differences” as unimpor- 
tant and inessential, and in the case at hand this would 
undoubtedly be justified. Nevertheless, it is important 
to note that, just as in the case of the method of agree- 
ment it was seen to be well-nigh impossible to secure in- 
stances which had only one factor in common, so in the 
use of this second method it is exceedingly difficult to ob- 
tain cases differing in only a single circumstance. Very 
often these minor differences may be disregarded as 
irrelevant, but in this, as in other matters, what at one 
time seemed irrelevant has sometimes been shown later 
to be really significant, and the cautious scientist will 
bear this in mind.
-P-A-G-E-89

8. In order to eliminate as far as possible these practi- 
cal difficulties, Mill combined these two methods so that 
the logical conclusiveness of the Method of Difference 
might be combined with the practical availability of the 
Method of Agreement. The canon of the Joint Method 
seems somewhat alarmingly involved, but to those who 
understand the Methods of Agreement and Difference, 
the advantage to be gained by their joint use will become 
apparent. If two or more instances in which the phenom- 
enon occurs have only one circumstance in common, while 
two or more instances in which tt does not occur have noth- 
ing in common save the absence of that circumstance, the 
circumstance in which alone the two sets differ is the effect, 
or the cause, or an indispensable part of the cause of the 
phenomenon. 
The obvious difficulties of this rule are not confined 
to its involved phraseology. As the above-mentioned 
critic points out,! ‘it would be better if for ‘the circum- 
stance in which alone the two sets of instances differ’ we 
read ‘the circumstance in which alone the second set of 
instances agrees to differ from the first set.’” As may 
be seen by reference to the symbolic representation cited 
above,? as well as to the illustrations given below, the 
method is useful in those cases where several factors are 
common to a set of instances in which the same result 
occurs. The elimination of certain of these factors is 
made possible by the discovery of cases in which they 
are present without bringing about this result. 
Take the instance cited in applying the Method of 
Agreement. We there saw that, by changing the nature 
of the filter from cotton to asbestos, Pasteur had indi- 
cated that the nature of the filter did not matter. We

realized, however, that this introduction of the air was 
not the only factor common to the two cases; that many 
circumstances, such as the presence of the same investi- 
gator, of the force of gravitation, of a specific tempera- 
ture, atmospheric moisture, and the like, were shared by 
the two tests. Could any of them be the cause of the 
appearance of the germs? We shall have occasion later 
on to ask ourselves this question in a somewhat different 
context. For the present let us note how, by supple- 
menting the use of the Method of Agreement by the in- 
troduction of the Method of Difference, it could easily 
be shown that none of the above-mentioned factors was 
the cause. It was simply necessary to show that in 
many instances where these factors were present, even 
if others in addition to the dust-carrying air were not, 
the germs did not appear. 
To clarify further the use of the Joint Method, as well 
as because it is frequently employed in investigations 
such as this, it is desirable to present another illustration, 
this time one not taken from the laboratory. Preven- 
tive medicine finds it necessary not only to cure the sick 
and to prevent contagion, but also if possible to protect 
the healthy from the exposure which caused the original 
cases. It is therefore important to discover how the 
sick persons were infected. In a given town, let us say, 
several cases of anthrax have occurred. What was the 
cause? The health department will inquire about the 
habits and recent activities of the various patients. All 
are women and almost all are employed in the same loca- 
tion. But so are many others who were not infected. 
Several are in a brush factory, but then others who also 
have the disease are not. What we must find, if that be 
possible, is some circumstance common to all the cases,  
-P-A-G-E-91
  EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE 83 
which distinguishes them from all persons not infected. 
This factor is finally found to be that they all purchased 
a certain cheap grade of fur which they have been wear- 
ing and which has infected them; whereas the other 
women of the town had nothing in common which 
might have been connected with the disease, save the 
fact that none of them had worn the furs. Of course, in 
actual experience the lines may never be so sharply 
drawn. Some women may have bought fur pieces and 
avoided infection by reason of greater resistance, or 
other modifying conditions may have entered. How- 
ever, the method is effectively employed, though com- 
plete precision is impossible. It depends on discovering 
all the cases united by some common circumstances, 
and then eliminating other factors also common to 
them, by discovering that these latter are not actually 
productive of the results in other cases where they are 
present. 
4. It may not always be possible to find instances in 
which a phenomenon is totally absent. To cover cases 
of this kind Mill distinguished a fourth method, the 
Method of Concomitant Variations, depending on the 
fact that Whatever phenomenon varies in any manner 
whenever another phenomenon varies in some particular 
manner, is either a cause or an effect of that phenomenon, or 
ts connected with it through some fact of causation. It will 
be recalled that Pasteur, in considering the effects of 
the dusts of the air, took specimens in various places, in 
the city, in rural districts, even on remote Alpine gla- 
ciers. Certain of these specimens, he found, were purer 
than others in respect to their micro-organic contents. 
Moreover, the degree of concentration of these germs 
corresponded to the relative purity of the air in the dif-  
-P-A-G-E-92
  
  84 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
ferent localities. Inasmuch as this variation of the at- 
mospheric dust was the only ‘‘significant”’ circumstance 
which was changed in the different tests, the Method of 
Concomitant Variations is really a refined use of the 
Method of Difference. Where the corresponding varia- 
tions can be quantitatively measured, this method gives 
striking results.!_| Where such a factor as a specific 
change in temperature gives rise to corresponding 
changes, let us say, in the degree of vitality of the organ- 
isms affected by these altered conditions, the relation- 
ship becomes all the more apparent. This relationship is 
not necessarily uniform throughout the scale of tempera- 
ture; there may be no effect apparent for a wide range, 
but below a certain degree and above another tempera- 
ture, definite effects will be noticeable and therefore as- 
signable to these heat conditions. Clearly it is not nec- 
essary that, as one circumstance increases in quantity or 
intensity, the other should do the same. Where the one 
increases while the other diminishes, or whenever there 
is any proportionate variation between two or more 
phenomena, especially if a quantitative ratio is discover- 
able, one is justified in concluding that this relationship 
is not accidental, but is due to a causal connection. 
5. The fifth and last method defined by Mill was 
called by him the Method of Residues: Subduct from 
any phenomenon such part as is known by previous in- 
ductions to be the effect of certain antecedents, and the 
residue of the phenomenon is the effect of the remaining 
antecedents. ‘The number of instances in which one can 
assign to their precise causes all the conditions of a case 
except the one under investigation, and thereby isolate 
1 Cf. Joule’s experiments described in chap. vi, and also section 4, 
chap. x. °
-P-A-G-E-93
  EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE 85 
the previously unknown cause of this particular condi- 
tion, seems exceedingly rare. But such approximate om- 
niscience is not really required for the useful application 
of the Method of Residues. In practice it is the method 
which we continually employ when some new and un- 
usual circumstance arises in an otherwise familiar situa- 
tion. You come into your room and find your desk in 
total disorder; you hear the sound of a gun in a usually 
quiet forest — and in either instance you associate these 
events not with any normal circumstances, but with 
some happening which you had not previously attended 
to — say, the stranger who passed you in the hallway or 
the new campers who pitched their tents recently by the 
lakeside. Just so the scientist, who in pursuing his inves- 
tigations discovers some unexpected circumstance, re- 
considers and re-analyzes the conditions under which 
they arose to find the neglected factor which had caused 
them. It may be seen that this method is rather of serv- 
ice in improving the observation of a case, and its com- 
plete diagnosis, than in actually verifying an hypothesis. 
In this sense the Method of Residues is to be regarded as 
being comparable to a total consideration and analysis 
of the problem under investigation, rather than as a 
testing of those factors which have been enumerated as 
being relevant to the situation. Such a testing, by 
means of one or more of the methods previously consid- 
ered, must follow an application of this analysis. Nev- 
ertheless, its usefulness and significance must not be 
underestimated. Indeed, some of the most magnifi- 
cent discoveries in the history of scientific research de- 
pended on investigations guided by this type of reason- 
ing, as, for example, the dramatic discovery of the planet 
Neptune. Such a discovery is then tested out by one
-P-A-G-E-94
  86 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
of the previously mentioned inductive methods; that 
is, having been led by the Method of Residues to ask 
whether the desk was rifled by a burglar, the shot fired 
by a camper, or the planet Uranus diverted from its 
course by the influence of the planet Neptune, we seek 
to verify these judgments by employing one of the 
other methods of proof. 
Having considered these methods which the investi- 
gator uses in his attempts to validate some general 
hypothesis concerning a phenomenon, by reference to 
the precise conditions involved in any such case, indicat- 
ing how he shall control the factors of his experiment, 
and what tests will be significant and convincing, it is 
now necessary to mention briefly the difficulties attend- 
ing these steps. These difficulties are not restricted to 
any one or another of the particular methods, but are 
involved in any effort to discover the causal relationship 
between objects or events, and in the very concept of 
what a cause is. 
Let us start by considering a practical difficulty which 
might actually arise if some student were to attempt to 
reproduce Pasteur’s experiments. He would expose his 
flasks to the air, set them aside for a while to allow the 
germs to multiply, and then study the infusion under his 
microscope. His results, we feel confident, should con- 
form to those of Pasteur. But supposing that he had 
neglected to consider with sufficient care the nature of 
the liquid in his flasks. If this liquid contained even a 
comparatively small amount of alcohol, or a strong salt 
solution, his results would be very different from those 
expected. To be sure, the bacteria would have presum- 
ably entered the exposed flasks, but the germicide pres- 
ent in the liquid would have killed them and prevented
-P-A-G-E-95
  EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE 87 
their reproduction in sufficient numbers to be readily 
observable. 
Shall we, then, be forced to conclude that, to some ex- 
tent at least, Pasteur’s opponents were right in claiming 
that the liquids employed were the causes of the life 
which arose in them? And if that is true, is it not 
equally proper to claim that decaying meat is the cause 
of the appearance of worms and maggots, and linen and 
corn the cause of mice? Are we justified in merely re- 
plying to these questions that we can now easily show, 
by the use of our inductive methodology, that none of 
these are the true causes of the life which arises in them 
since the organisms can arise even in their absence? 
The one thing necessary, we would say, is that the par- 
ent organism should be given an opportunity to gener- 
ate its offspring, and it therefore is the real cause of the 
resulting life. 
If, however, certain other favorable conditions in ad- 
dition to the mere presence of the parent organisms are 
necessary, are they not also causally related to the ef- 
fects which are produced? Moreover, we must go on to 
consider other factors which have determined the possi- 
bility of these events. All the environmental conditions 
which made it possible for the creature to thrive and to 
develop seem to enter into the field of consideration, all 
the long history of the individual and of its species; in- 
deed, it is difficult to decide where to stop. All these in- 
numerable factors and circumstances, it would appear, 
had their share in shaping the course of events in such a 
way that this particular object which we are studying 
could appear in precisely the manner in which it does 
appear. Are all of these contributing conditions to be 
viewed as the causes of the phenomenon? Surely that 
depends on precisely what we mean by ‘‘a cause.”
-P-A-G-E-96
  88 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
Section 5. What is a Cause? 
If a boulder is rolled down a hill, it may crush flowers, 
break down a fence, and killa snail. Though we speak 
of the destruction done as being caused by the boulder, 
yet we recognize that the presence of the flowers, of the 
fence, and of the snail were also causes, and the absence 
of a man may have been the cause of his not being killed. 
To this we may add as causes, in other senses, the slope 
of the hillside and the youngster who pushed the stone, 
gravity, and probably a variety of other influences. 
Indeed, in common language we not infrequently use 
the word “‘cause’’ to designate any particular type of ex- 
planation. If we hear cries in an adjoining room, we 
might say, ““What is the cause of the disturbance?” 
Various answers might be given to such a question. 
Since what is really desired is an explanation, we might 
say that a child had been the cause of the noise, or we 
might specify the physiological organs which had been 
instrumental in producing the outcry. Or we might say 
that neglect had been the cause, meaning thereby that 
the child’s distress could have been prevented through 
adequate care. Or we might say that milk had been 
the cause, meaning that it was the object, conscious or 
unconscious, which was being demanded. 
The philosopher Aristotle presented a classification of 
possible uses of the term “‘cause.” Taking as an exam- 
ple a wooden statue, he showed that a sculptor might be 
the cause of a figure, or that the idea in the sculptor’s 
mind might be the cause, or that the wood might be the 
cause, or else the desire of the artist to honor Hermes. 
From one point of view none of these factors may be re- 
garded as genuinely being the cause of the artistic prod- 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
  
EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE 89 
uct, since any one of them might be present without 
actually producing the particular effect. And that, as 
we have seen, is precisely what is demanded of a bona 
fide cause, using it in the strict sense. The whole situa- 
tion, then, would be the cause, or that aspect of it which 
inevitably yielded the effect. But can we speak of a 
total situation in precisely that way, and, if so, where 
shall we stop? Shall we not be obliged to consider the 
muscles of the sculptor’s arm, the descent of the artist, 
the forest in which the tree was cut, etc.? And will this 
not take us to the consideration of some First Cause 
which accounts for all of that? Very often interesting 
questions of very different types draw us into the same 
predicament. So the child questions its parent, asking, 
“Who made the flowers?’”’ ‘Who made the mountains 
and the valleys?”’ Thus Napoleon sought to refute an 
atheistic general by pointing to the starry heavens ask- 
ing him, ‘“‘Who created the spacious firmament?” 
Astronomy offers no reply to this last question, and, 
indeed, science has no answer to any of these queries 
when phrased in this way. The botanist explains the 
flower by pointing to the seed; the geologist finds in me- 
teorological changes the explanation which he seeks for 
the contour of the land. If we ask who made an auto- 
mobile or a clock, we may discover the manufacturer of 
either. But science offers no analogy to disclose the ori- 
gin of the natural product as was disclosed in the origin 
of the human product by the man who made it. Though 
the idea of cause leads us to consider a total situation 
and all that lies back of it, science is satisfied in find- 
ing not a Cause, but many causes. 
To claim that any of the above suggested uses of the 
word “‘cause” are improper or incorrect would be un-
-P-A-G-E-98
  90 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
justifiable, but at the same time we must clearly recog- 
nize that for scientific purposes the term has a restricted 
and specific implication. What the scientist seeks are 
the proximate, not the ultimate, preconditions of the 
event which he is studying. He is searching for certain 
natural patterns or ways in which things hang together 
which will increase his understanding of the event. But 
before we ask more definitely what the function and 
characteristics of this understanding are, it will be well 
to note again the outstanding features of these patterns, 
these causal sequences which lead to it. 
The general scheme of causal relationship has been 
phrased: ‘‘ Whenever things occur in certain relations to 
each other, then a thing having a fixed relation to these 
things will occur at a date fixed relatively to their 
dates.” ! You hit one billiard ball with your cue and, 
if your aim is good, it will presently move another in a 
definite path. You expose a liquid to the dusts of the 
air and, unless some other counteracting cause inter- 
feres, micro-organisms will shortly be discernible in it. 
Moreover, we feel certain that, other things being equal, 
this always has been and always will be possible. 
What does this mean? ‘The great skeptic, David 
Hume, claimed that, when two events are causally re- 
lated, all that we really know about them is ‘‘that they 
are contiguous in time and space and that the object we 
call cause precedes what we call effect,” or at least 
comes along with it. Is a causal relationship, then, 
nothing more than invariable succession? The spokes 
of a wheel succeed one another and always in the same 
order, so that if the process continued without end, an 
observer might be led to believe that Spoke A caused 
1 Bertrand Russell, Scientific Method in Philosophy, p. 210.
-P-A-G-E-99
EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE 91 
Spoke B to follow it. If, however, the wheel were to 
stop turning, he would find that no such causation actu- 
ally took place; although the movement of the spokes 
is causally connected, that connection consists in a 
common relation to a third factor of which their move- 
ments are both effects. So also a common cause pro- 
duces the phenomena which we call winter and spring, or 
day and night, and provides the basis of their sequence. 
Wherever such an invariable sequence is discovered, the 
scientist feels certain that he has discovered a real pat- 
tern, areal causal relation in nature. Ina complex situ- 
ation, however, he is always trying to single out particu- 
lar patterns, to analyze the complex relations into sim- 
pler ones. How could he discover whether it was really 
Spoke B or the common motion of the axle that caused 
Spoke A to revolve? By removing B; that is, by apply- 
ing the Method of Difference. Many situations, how- 
ever, are in practice not susceptible of such simple treat- 
ment. It is extremely important not to assume that, 
just because some event came after another, it was due 
to its influence; even when the succession is constantly 
repeated, this may be the result of some common cause 
rather than the result of either one or the other. In 
other cases experimental control is entirely out of the 
range of possibility. We can hardly start pushing the 
earth over to see whether we cannot pass directly from 
winter to summer. We cannot experiment with the 
past, and discover whether Louis XVI’s weakness was 
the real cause of the French Revolution. How, then, do 
we analyze such situations? When we cannot apply the 
inductive methods in actual experiment, we apply them - 
in imagination. We can imagine what would have oc- 
curred had Archimedes found his fulerum and succeeded
-P-A-G-E-100
  92 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
in moving the earth, and we can in imagination observe 
summer succeeding immediately upon winter. We can 
in imagination kill Louis XVI at the age of ten, and ob- 
serve that events are not appreciably altered. Such 
are the uses of reflection! 
What basis have we for assuming that there is uni- 
formity of this kind in nature, that a given situation will 
yield definite consequences, and that for every set of 
circumstances there are antecedents which account for 
them? ‘This question leads at once to one of the funda- 
mental aspects of the universe in which we find our- 
selves. We discover, as we look about in nature, that 
events do not just happen without any relation to pre- 
ceding or succeeding events, but that certain sequences 
in events take place over and over again. We see light- 
ning, and we hear thunder. We are assured that every 
time we hear thunder, lightning has previously been ob- 
served. When we swat flies, they cease to buzz. No 
matter how many we swat, provided we swat vigorously 
and accurately enough, the same result will occur. 
These two examples are but typical of the myriads that 
occur in nature. Our life is one long course of discovery 
of these invariable sequences, these fixed patterns in 
events, that form so essential a part of our experience. 
They are, in fact, precisely that feature of our uni» 
verse that makes it an ordered cosmos rather than a 
mere chaos, in which lightning might be followed now by 
thunder, now by cream cheese, and now by purple- 
bearded tigers. These patterns which force themselves 
upon our attention, and to the analysis of which the 
scientist devotes his life, are causal relations, uniform 
correlations between causes and effects, such that, un- 
less some other cause has prevented it, when one part of 
the pattern is discovered the rest is sure to follow. 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE 93 
How do we know that these patterns exist in nature? 
Because we have discovered them in our experience, and 
have found that they repeat themselves again and again. 
Sometimes, to be sure, exceptions seem to occur, but we 
have hitherto been able to explain these exceptions as 
cases in which one pattern entered into and was altered 
by another pattern. Most bodies, we have found, fall 
to the earth; but balloons rise. This anomaly is ex- 
plained by reference to the more general laws of me- 
chanics, which furnish patterns into which we can satis- 
factorily fit bodies lighter than air. How do we know 
that these sequences will continue to repeat themselves 
in the future? Strictly speaking, of course, we don’t; 
it is possible that to-morrow the trump of doom will 
sound, that the dead will arise, and that all things will 
be made new — with, it is to be supposed, quite new 
millennial patterns for events to follow. Yet no man 
can really believe that such an overthrow will take 
place; the uniformity of nature, the conviction that 
things will continue to occur in the same manner as they 
have hitherto, is undoubtedly the best-founded general- 
ization in the whole range of human experience. 
It is this very generalization which provides the basis 
for scientific understanding and gives to it its outstand- 
ing characteristics. If these patterns are discoverable, 
then they can be traced out in detail. Prediction, as 
well as historical reconstruction, with all the innumer- 
able advantages which it entails, then becomes possible. 
When we see clouds gathering, we learn to seek shelter 
from the approaching storm. And closely allied to this 
possibility of prediction come the occasions to control 
some at least of the events involved in any sequence. 
Not only do we learn to seek shelter in houses, we also 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  94 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
attach lightning rods to our homes in order to protect 
them from the effects of electric bolts — we modify the 
particular series of events, alter the pattern of nature. 
Of course, the particular pattern which we select in the 
interests of prediction and control will depend on the 
purposes which we aim to accomplish. If we wish to 
photograph the flashes, we will concern ourselves with a 
somewhat different set of causal relations and arrange 
our actions accordingly. Sometimes the fact that mi- 
crobes multiply in certain liquids will guide us; at other 
times the fact that they may be killed by other media 
will be more significant for our purposes. It was this 
same consideration which led us to remark, in an earlier 
chapter, that any phenomenon could be classified and 
defined in different ways for different contingencies. 
The very fact that it is possible to achieve knowledge 
by observation and experiment rests on the existence of 
uniform and invariable causal sequences in nature anJ 
on the fact that events do not occur detached from se- 
quences. If we can find one of these sequences or pat- 
terns, we are as sure as we can be of anything in experi- 
ence that it will follow its stereotyped routine. Hence 
a single crucial set of experiments can prove to us a 
universal causal law. By the use of the experimental 
methods we can verify an hypothesis. We can proceed 
from particular instances to general law; that is an ul- 
timate fact of our experience. It cannot be explained 
by anything else; but it throws a flood of light upon 
the very nature of our universe. For knowledge to 
be possible, our universe must, to that extent, be an 
ordered cosmos; which is but another way of saying 
that the existence of scientific understanding, predic- 
tion, and control depends on the intelligibility of our
-P-A-G-E-103
EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE 95 
universe and the possibility of framing universal laws. 
How these laws may be developed we shall see in the 
next chapter.

  CHAPTER V 
DEDUCTIVE ELABORATION AND THE RELATION OF 
IMPLICATION IN MATHEMATICS 
Section 1. The Nature and Function of Mathematical 
Reasoning 
Tue fourth stage in our analysis of the typical act of 
reflective thinking we found to be the elaboration of 
the various hypotheses that had been suggested as solu- 
tions to the initial difficulty, and the careful ascertain- 
ing of all the consequences they might be expected to 
have if true. Thus, in our example of the Copernican 
theory, we saw how men reasoned that, if that were a 
correct explanation of the planetary motions, then there 
would have to be some apparent displacement, no mat- 
ter how slight, in the positions of the fixed stars when 
viewed from opposite sides of the earth’s orbit. 
It is this process which we purpose to examine in more 
detail in this chapter. Just how can we ascertain the 
consequences that will follow from certain other truths? 
It is obvious that we are here dealing with a kind of re- 
flection that differs markedly from that summing up of 
great bodies of facts under general laws that has occu- 
pied our attention hitherto. We are concerned here 
with the relations that subsist between two or more prop- 
ositions, not with those obtaining among facts; and 
more especially with that type of relation which holds 
between two propositions when from the truth of the 
first we can infer the truth of the second. We can ex- 
press this relation in several ways. We can say that one
-P-A-G-E-106
  98 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
proposition is ‘‘implied”’ by another, or we can say that 
the second ‘‘follows necessarily’’ from the first. It is 
significant that the truth of the relationship in no wise 
depends upon the truth of the first proposition. It 
makes no difference whether John has a sister Helen or 
not; we know that if he has a sister Helen, then she has a 
brother John. 
This relation of “if... then...” is called the relation 
of implication, and the elaboration of hypotheses which 
constitutes the fourth stage of our analysis consists in 
the discovery of the various propositions which are im- 
plied by the original suggestion. This whole process of 
following the network of relations which bind truths to- 
gether is called “‘deduction”’; whenever we can deduce 
one proposition from another, we know that a relation 
of implication obtains between them. This relation of 
implication has been defined as that which holds be- 
tween two propositions when the denial of the second 
is inconsistent with the truth of the first. 
Our example of this deductive elaboration of hypothe- 
ses will be drawn from mathematics, whose very defini- 
tion is ‘‘the science of implication.” For mathematics 
is concerned with that structure of things which by its 
existence makes it possible to proceed from one truth to 
another deductively. That is why in every completely 
developed science the part played by mathematics is 
very large indeed. The relations with which the math- 
ematician deals seem to be a part of the very founda- 
tion of the world we live in, so that we have discovered 
that, if any proposition that holds true of experience is 
elaborated in accordance with the rules of mathematics, 
the conclusions thereupon reached will also hold of ex- 
perience. This fact about our universe, and the addi-
-P-A-G-E-107
DEDUCTION IN MATHEMATICS 99 
tional fact that the quantitative methods of mathe- 
matics admit of the utmost accuracy and precision of 
formulation, explain why in each of the fields we have 
looked at so far mathematics is so fundamental. It 
does seem to be true that the more highly developed a 
science becomes, and the more knowledge we gain about 
the relations between its objects, the more its beliefs 
tend to fall into mathematical form, and to admit of 
treatment by purely mathematical methods. So true is 
it that a science is successful just in so far as it is able 
to formulate its beliefs mathematically, that many men 
have naturally come to think that in mathematics is to 
be found the exemplar of all true knowledge. 
They have been aided in reaching this conclusion by 
the seeming absolute certainty with which mathemati- 
cal conclusions are vested. In experimental science, in 
even so well-established a body of knowledge as modern 
chemistry, however sure we may be that, tested again 
and again in the laboratory, our beliefs are true and un- 
shakable, we can never be quite certain that some new 
discovery may not upset all our theories and require an 
entire readjustment. We have just been astounded to 
learn that astronomy, which we had fancied in all its 
essential features fixed since the days of Newton, has 
suddenly been forced by the theory of relativity to 
reconsider a great many of its fundamental beliefs. 
Hence it is little wonder that investigators have looked 
enviously upon mathematics as that science in which 
truths can be proved with no fear that they will ever be 
questioned. When a proposition in mathematics has 
been proved, within the field of its own presuppositions, 
itis so. Inno other field of human knowledge can this 
be said. For this reason, there have even been men
-P-A-G-E-108
100 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
who have dreamed of the time when it would be just as 
easy to determine whether a certain course of action is 
right or wrong, and when that question would be just as 
finally settled, as it is now to determine once and for all 
the product of 674 and 45367. Or they have painted 
pictures of the replacing of our present costly, cumber- 
some, and exceedingly inefficient system of popular elec- 
tion as a means of determining the best man to govern 
us, by a mathematical method that would give us the 
fittest candidate as infallibly as we can now compute the 
area of a triangle with given sides. 
Are these admirers of mathematical reasoning indeed 
right? Is the mind that has been trained to think in 
terms of mathematics, to solve mathematical problems 
and to reach certainty by rigid and unassailable mathe- 
matical proofs, really the best? Though this has been 
believed by many of the world’s greatest thinkers, most 
men at the present time do not maintain it. While ad- 
mitting all that is claimed for the certainty of mathe- 
matical thought, they hold that the field to which it 
applies has its limits, and that, although it is an invalu- 
able tool, it is by no means the only one that must be 
employed. 
Mathematics, then, guides us into the world of the re- 
lations between truths, and hence helps us incalculably 
in the interpretation of nature. But the great advan- 
tage of mathematical beliefs is that we can know be- 
yond peradventure of doubt when they are right. Since 
the trained mind is the mind that is right, and knows it 
is right, we have in mathematics an opportunity to ob- 
serve the trained mind at work in a field where it has 
succeeded in testing out its hypotheses rigorously. In 
fact, mathematics is preéminently an instrument for
-P-A-G-E-109
    DEDUCTION IN MATHEMATICS 101 
testing, for proving what has been suggested, and it is 
only secondarily that it served as a direct means for the 
discovery of new truth. This holds especially of nearly 
all of the mathematical reasoning that finds its way into 
books. Of course, the discovery of new knowledge in 
geometry or algebra springs out of the imagination that 
can envisage new suggestions, and is not different from 
such discovery in any branch of science. But what the 
ordinary demonstration contains is not the intuitive in- 
sight, the creative synthesis which is the mark of the 
great mathematica] pathfinder, but rather the setting 
forth of the precise proof of relationships in such a form 
that their validity can be established for all. And one 
reason at least for the certainty of mathematical knowl- 
edge lies in the great ease and simplicity with which it is 
possible to apply to it the most rigorous tests. 
For example, take the simple proposition in geometry, 
the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right 
angles. We know that this is true.! It is thoroughly 
tested knowledge. We know that if there is at any time 
a triangle anywhere, this must be true of its angles. We 
know it because it has been proved, proved in a very 
simple way. We do not have to measure the angles of 
any triangle to verify this, say, on the planet Mars, be- 
cause we have established it once and for all, for every 
possible triangle. 
Section 2. The Pythagorean Theorem — the Empirical 
Discovery 
Let us now take a simple piece of mathematical rea- 
soning with which we are all familiar, and analyze it 
1 Provided we know what we mean by all the terms involved, of 
course. See Section 5.
-P-A-G-E-110
  102 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
carefully, both to discover the superiority of good over 
poor mathematical thought, and to find out if possible 
the significance such reflective thinking possesses. We 
shall trace the development of the Pythagorean theorem 
from its early beginnings in crude experimental survey- 
ing to its classic formulation in the 47th proposition of 
the First Book of Euclid, and we shall then subject that 
elaborate reasoning to careful scrutiny. 
The science of geometry originated, we are told by 
the earliest historians, in the necessity for finding some 
means of laying out the boundaries of the Egyptian corn- 
fields after the floods of the Nile had swept away the old 
marks. Egyptian surveyors were called ‘‘rope-stretch- 
ers’”’ because they worked with a rope twelve units long, 
divided by knots into three lengths of three units, four 
units and five units, respectively. When this rope was 
stretched into the form of a triangle, they found that 
they had, between the sides of three and four units, an 
angle that was sufficiently like a right angle to suit their 
purposes. 
What had these rope-stretchers discovered? They 
had observed the fact that apparently a rope of a certain 
length, stretched into a triangle of a certain size, formed 
aright angle. How had they tested this? By measur- 
ing ropes and by comparing the angle formed with right 
angles formed in other ways. Their test was obviously 
crude and inexact, and they could never be certain 
whether they had a right angle or only an approxima- 
tion of one, or whether if they had more accurate meas- 
urements they might not get an angle less rather than 
more like a right angle. 
In Greece there lived men who were more interested 
in knowing for its own sake than in any practical appli-
-P-A-G-E-111
  
DEDUCTION IN MATHEMATICS 108 
cation of that knowledge, and they studied these curious 
discoveries of the Egyptians. One of them, as the tra- 
dition goes, a somewhat mysterious figure, Pythagoras, 
observed that in the triangle of the rope-stretchers the 
sides bore a relation to each other such that 3? plus 4? = 
5°; that is, that in a triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5, the 
squares of the two sides equaled the square of the side 
opposite what seemed to be aright angle. This set him 
to thinking. Wasit true? It was proved only by meas- 
urements of doubtful accuracy. Or, granted that the 
angle was really a right angle, was this merely an acci- 
dent, due to the particular lengths of sides chosen? 
Was there any reason for the fact? Or, was it possible 
that it was due to the very nature of right triangles? If 
so, was there any other shaped right triangle of which it 
could be proved true? Pythagoras was a pathfinder in 
mathematics, and truths that had remained unfruitful 
in the minds of others suggested further possible truths 
to him. 
Section 3. The Pythagorean Theorem — The Proof 
for the Isosceles Right Triangle 
Pythagoras found that there was in truth another 
shape of right triangle of which he could prove that the 
sum of the squares upon the legs was equal to the square 
upon the hypotenuse. In the case of the isosceles right 
triangle, not only does the same relation appear, but it 
is possible to demonstrate it by means of a simple fig- 
ure. Thus, take the isosceles right triangle ABC, with 
squares erected upon its three sides, and draw the diag- 
onals of the three squares. It is easy to prove that the 
eight new right triangles formed are equal to each other. 
Thus, right triangle 1 = right triangle 2, because two 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  104 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
sides of the one are equal to two sides of the other, re- 
spectively. Similarly, right triangle 2 = right triangle 
ABC =3 =4. Now, the 
diagonals of a square bi- 
sect each other at right 
angles, and hence, for 
the same reason, right 
triangle 5=6=7=8. 
Right triangle 5= right 
triangle ABC, as the side 
and adjoining angle of 
the one is equal to the 
side and adjoining an- 
gle of the other. Hence, 
Figure 4 all nine triangles are 
proved equal, and 1 + 2 
+3+4=5+6+7+8. Thus, for the right triangle 
with equal legs, the Pythagorean theorem has been 
proved to hold. 
Now, just what has been done in this geometrical 
proof of a special case of the right triangle? In the first 
place, it is now seen that it is not an accident that the 
sum of the squares on the legs is equal to that on the hy- 
potenuse. We know that it follows from the very na- 
ture and structure of the isosceles right triangle, and that 
it could not be otherwise. We have proved it to be so, 
and we have proved it not for just some particular tri- 
angle, like the 3, 4, 5 triangle of the rope-stretchers, but 
for every and any right triangle whose legs are equal. Did 
we have to measure the legs and the angle of the trian- 
gle? No, not atall. In fact, were we to try, we should 
soon discover that we could not do so, for, as we know, 
the sides of such a triangle are incommensurable. How, 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
  DEDUCTION IN MATHEMATICS 10% 
then, are we justified in assuming that every isoscelen 
right triangle has such a relation between its sides when 
we cannot measure those of even one? 
Before answering this question, let us ask another. 
Of what triangle is the proposition true? Is it true of 
the figure on the paper? No, because that is manifestly 
inaccurate. Is it true of any right triangle we could 
draw or lay out anywhere, with the most exact of in- 
struments? No, because no instruments are accurate 
enough to construct one absolutely right angle. Then 
of what is it true? We have just said, of every isosceles 
right triangle. But just what is the isosceles right tri- 
angle of which it is true? Obviously, it is no existent tri- 
angular object anywhere in the world, but rather a 
geometrical figure we have defined as “‘a plane surface, 
bounded by three straight lines, two of whose sides are 
equal and enclose a right angle.” We have proved that, 
af there should actually exist such a thing, the squares 
on its sides would have to equal the square on its hy- 
potenuse; but we have no means of knowing that such a 
thing does exist, and we are here dealing with an abstract 
figure, made by selecting certain characteristics of ex- 
istent things, and by excluding others, such as inac- 
curacy, etc., by our definition. Starting with this defini- 
tion, and assuming that certain other relations are also 
true (such as, for example, that the diagonals of a square 
bisect each other at right angles), we have shown that if 
there is such a thing, and if those other relations are 
true, then if we consider the squares on the sides of such 
a triangle they must be equal to the square on the hy- 
potenuse. These proportions are related by a chain of 
implications. 
Let us now ask, what advance has been made in this 
   
-P-A-G-E-114
    106 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
strictly mathematical proof over the purely empirical 
testing of the 3, 4, 5, triangle? First, it is a much more 
thorough test. We could not be quite sure of the latter; 
we know, with absolute certainty, that the former is 
true. Hence we have achieved a belief that has been 
rigorously tested. Secondly, we are no longer concerned 
with particular triangles of certain sizes. We have 
proved that every isosceles right triangle has the same 
relation between its sides. Thus we have achieved 
both certain proof and universality. 
Yet there is a third and a most important distinction. 
The two propositions have been proved about entirely 
different kinds of things. In the first case, we were deal- 
ing with an actual rope of a certain length. In the 
second, we are dealing with an abstract figure defined by 
selecting certain chosen qualities from existent triangular 
objects. We have proved our proposition to be true in 
the realm of such abstract figures, that is, in what we 
call geometrical space, and to be true of any figure con- 
forming to the definition; but how do we know that it 
will hold true of real triangular objects in the actual 
world? It will do so only as those real objects possess a 
structure that is like that of the abstract triangle we 
have been discussing; that is, only as the inaccuracies 
and other adventitious qualities characteristic of these 
real objects are irrelevant to our purposes with them. 
Now, the whole secret of the enormous success of the 
mathematical interpretation of nature lies precisely in 
this fact, that, so far as we can ascertain by means of 
repeated experiments, for many of our most important 
purposes these inaccuracies are irrelevant, and thus 
actual triangular objects do possess a structure that 
does coincide closely enough with the abstract triangles
-P-A-G-E-115
DEDUCTION IN MATHEMATICS 107 
of which we prove things so that our proofs can be 
counted upon to hold of them also. Were this not the 
case, our geometry would be a pleasant game and noth- 
ing more; as it is, just because it seems to give us an 
insight into the nature of our world, it has proved im- 
mensely illuminating, and has served as one of the most 
potent tools in man’s hands for the understanding and 
the consequent conquest of nature. 
Section 4. The Pythagorean Theorem — the General 
Proof} ; 
But Pythagoras was not satisfied to stop with this 
proof. He still suspected it was possible to prove the 
relation for the 3, 4,5 
triangle, and if it held 
for the two cases, it 
might also hold for 
every case of right tri- 
angle. With this hy- 
pothesis in mind, he 
sought to discover a 
proof for the general 
ease. In this he even- 
tually succeeded, and 
this theorem we shall 
now examine more 
carefully, for it rep- 
resents geometrical 
thinking at its fullest. However, we shall not take up 
the proof that Pythagoras worked out, but rather the 
simpler form that was given to it by Euclid. 
Theorem: If a triangle, ABC, be right-angled, the 
1 Euclid, book 1, proposition 47. 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
    108 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
square constructed upon the side BC subtending the 
right angle is equal in area to the sum of the squares 
constructed upon the sides AB and AC which form the 
right angle. 
Construction: On the sides AB, BC, and AC, con- 
struct the squares BG, BE, and CH; through A draw AL 
parallel to BD, and join AD and FC. 
For our purposes it will not be necessary to give the 
entire proof in detail, as an examination of a single part 
will suffice. It will be remembered that the general 
method consists in proving first that triangle FBC = 
triangle ABD; then that triangle FBC is equal in area to 
one half the area of the square BG, and that triangle 
ABD is similarly equal to one half the rectangle BL, 
and that consequently BG is equal in area to BL. In 
the same way it is proved that the square CH is equal 
in area to the rectangle CL, and hence BG plus CH = 
BL plus CL, or the square BE. Let us examine the 
first part of the proof. 
Angle FBA = angle CBD, because both are right an- 
gles (definition of a square), and magnitudes which coin- 
cide with one another are equal. Add to both the angle 
ABC, and angle FBC = angle ABD, because if equals 
be added to equals the results are equal. FB= BA, 
and BC = BD, by definition of a square. Hence triangle 
FBC = triangle ABD, because two triangles are equal 
if two sides and the included angle of one are equal re- 
spectively to two sides and the included angle of the 
other. Because the angles GAB and BAC are both 
right angles, GA and AC are in the same straight line. 
Now the square BG is double in area the triangle FBC, 
because they are on the same base FB and between the 
same parallels FB and GC, and similarly the rectangle
-P-A-G-E-117
DEDUCTION IN MATHEMATICS 109 
BL is double the triangle ABD, because they are on the 
same base BD. and between the same parallels BD and 
AL (the area of a rectangle is equal to the base times the 
altitude, while that of a triangle is equal to one half the 
base times the altitude). Because the doubles of equals 
are equal to one another, the square BG is equal to the 
rectangle BL. And so on. 
What does this theorem prove? Like the proof about 
the isosceles right triangle, it proves nothing about any 
real object, but is true only of an abstract triangle. 
But now, in this more general case, we have proved our 
theorem, not about a triangle of some particular shape, 
such as one whose legs are equal, but of all right trian- 
gles whatsoever, and of the 3, 4, 5 kind incidentally. 
How did we reach this conclusion? Had-we attempted 
to measure all right triangles, following the method of 
the rope-stretchers, we should have required an infinite 
time. We might have reached a great probability, but 
we could never have become certain, as we are now, that 
no exception would ever be found. Instead, we have 
now shown the relation to follow from the nature of the 
right triangle itself, and have discovered that size and 
shape are quite irrelevant. That is, just as before we 
selected from our diagram triangularity, right-angled- 
ness, and equal-leggedness, leaving out of account par- 
ticular lengths, thickness of line, breadth, inaccurate 
drawing, etc., just so here we can disregard the equal- 
leggedness and consider only the two properties of trian- 
gularity and right-angledness. We have become more 
general and more abstract; the truth of our proposition 
depends upon fewer presuppositions. And, incidentally, 
we have proved a proposition that not only suggests an 
infinite number of further propositions, but that also is  
-P-A-G-E-118
  110 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
the basis of all the indirect measurement of geometry, 
and without which the practical applications of trig- 
onometry to surveying could scarcely exist. 
Section 6. Critical Examination of the Proof 
This, then, is an example of one type of mathematical 
reasoning. We have seen how it differs from the crude 
observation and untested experiment of the rope- 
stretchers; we have seen how Pythagoras first proved a 
particular case, and then how that case was made more 
general. Let us now examine this reasoning more 
searchingly, that we may ascertain its precise nature 
and its validity. 
What is the general nature of this reasoning? It isa 
series of ‘‘implications”’ or ‘‘necessary truths,” each de- 
pending on or following from some preceding truth. 
Each step is true if the preceding step is true. Angle 
FBC = ABD if it is true that the results of adding equals 
to equals are equal. Triangle FBC = ABD if it is true 
that two triangles are equal if two of their sides and the 
included angles are equal, and that proposition in turn is 
true if other relations are true. It is obvious that this 
chain is no stronger than its weakest link, and also that 
the chain must be attached at its end to something. If 
the reasoning follows step by step, the whole conclusion 
depends on the truth of the initial assumptions. The 
proof is true only if these are true. Now what exactly 
are the initial assumptions in this case? 
First, there are definitions. We have defined our tri- 
angle in certain arbitrary terms, suggested by, but dif- 
fering greatly from, any triangular object in the actual 
world. But here, again, definition is possible only in 
terms of something further. and so there are some terms
-P-A-G-E-119
DEDUCTION IN MATHEMATICS 111 
with which we must start, leaving them undefined. Our 
triangle is defined in terms of straight lines. A straight 
line is defined as ‘‘the shortest distance between two 
points.” But it is impossible to define distance with- 
out doing so in terms of a straight line, and we have got 
nowhere. ‘ 
Secondly, there are axioms such as that about equal 
“magnitudes. These are first truths which cannot be 
proved to follow from any simpler truth. Geometry, 
like all mathematics, has a certain number of such ulti- 
mate beliefs lying at its basis. 
Thirdly, there are the fundamental principles of im- 
plication itself, by which we pass from one step to the 
next. These principles, sometimes called the ‘‘laws of 
thought,” are so ultimate that it is almost impossible to 
formulate them into words without at the same time em- 
ploying them. An outstanding example is the so-called 
‘principle of contradiction,” that a thing cannot be that 
which it is not. 
Now whence come these axioms, whence come these 
laws of thought? How do we know that they are true? 
For upon their validity depends the entire certainty 
we have found so characteristic of mathematical reason- 
ing. Here we reach a point where great disagreement 
of opinion has existed since the very beginning of 
thought and is very widespread to-day. The oldest and 
most common answer has been, we just know that they 
are so. They are self-evident truths, which cannot be 
denied without bringing indescribable confusion and 
contradiction into our thinking. Unfortunately for this 
point of view, it was discovered and proved in the last 
century that not only could these axioms be denied 
without introducing any inconsistency into our think-
-P-A-G-E-120
  112 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
ing, but that we could build up other systems of reason- 
ing that seemed in every way as valid as our ordinary 
Euclidean geometry. Which of these geometries was 
true? Both followed from their premises, and as ab- 
stract sciences both were able to pass the test of internal 
consistency. But which premises were true? Some 
took the position that axioms were merely generaliza- 
tions from experience, and that we just found our world 
to be like that which they describe. Unfortunately for 
this point of view, although, of course, a geometry that 
is to be useful to us must be able to describe the world in 
which we live fairly accurately, so far as means at our 
disposal for testing out which set of axioms is true are 
concerned, there are a number of different sets, each 
giving rise to its own different geometry, and each 
equally able to interpret our world. For instance, in 
one of them it is quite possible to have more than one 
straight line drawn between two points, and unless we 
were able to measure distances enormously greater than 
we can with anything at our disposal, we should never 
be able to tell whether we were living in one kind of a 
world or the other. 
Hence most mathematicians to-day regard the axioms 
at the basis of geometry as neither self-evident nor found 
in experience, but rather as conventional assumptions 
about our world, very much like our definitions of geo- 
metrical objects. These assumptions work on the whole, 
but we have no means for testing with extreme accuracy 
whether our world really corresponds to one set or the 
other. Where we can thus not prove which is true, we 
sensibly choose that system which will work and which 
is by far the simplest, ordinary Euclidian geometry. 
Hence geometry is now regarded as a wholly abstract 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
  DEDUCTION IN MATHEMATICS 118 
or hypothetical science, which treats of the properties, 
not of anything that actually exists, but of objects 
which are defined in a certain conventional way, and 
which therefore must have the properties which we as- 
sign to them in our definitions. The axioms about space 
are not truths which we discover to hold of the space in 
which our universe is set, but rather assumptions about 
an abstract space whose nature we have agreed shall be 
such as is described by them. It would be quite possible, 
the geometrician tells us, to assume that our space had a 
great many other characteristics, and that other axioms 
described it better than those of Euclid. Such systems 
have in fact been constructed by Lobachevsky, by 
Riemann, and by others, and, for the portions of that 
actual space in which we live and with which we are our- 
selves acquainted, they could perhaps be made to apply 
just as well as the ordinary system. But they are very 
much more complicated, and hence there is every reason 
for retaining the traditional system in all of the practical 
applications of geometry. 
It is possible, maintain the upholders of this view of 
mathematics, that the time may come when, in measur- 
ing the immensities of interstellar space, we shall dis- 
cover that some one of these other systems of geometry 
is more nearly like the nature of our space. It is possi- 
ble that developments following the discoveries of Ein- 
stein may lead to the adoption of non-Euclidean geom- 
etry by astonomers in certain cases. This is, however, 
doubtful, because in such measurements our only yard- 
rule is a beam of light, and it seems much easier to as- 
sume that our yard-rule is not quite straight than to 
assume that the space that perceptibly deviates from it 
is different from what we had thought.
-P-A-G-E-122
    114 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
In contrast to this effort to free mathematics of all 
dependence upon the world we actually experience, 
some mathematicians believe that the axioms of Eu- 
clidean geometry are fundamental abstractions from 
experience, rather than conventions arrived at inde- 
pendently of it — abstractions so constantly present, so 
universal to all mankind, so simply and clearly con- 
ceived, and so basic in man’s thinking, that all men may 
and at an early age do understand exactly what aspect 
of our common experience they refer to. Although 
these men are in a distinct minority to-day, there seems 
much to be said for their contention that the axioms 
and the space of our ordinary geometry are not purely 
arbitrary conventions, and that while they are un- 
doubted simplifications, they are nevertheless derived 
from a fundamental aspect of our universe. Support is 
lent to this view by the fact that although the defini- 
tions of geometrical figures, and the axioms concerning 
the nature of geometrical space, may be regarded as con- 
structions of the mind reached by convention and agree- 
ment, the axioms about quantity in general, and espe- 
cially the so-called laws of thought, seem to us to be 
more deep-seated. Are they, like the geometrical ax- 
ioms, conventions? Is it possible to interpret our ex- 
perience just as well if we assume other and contradic- 
tory axioms? So far it can only be said that we do not 
know. It has not yet been done. No one has been able to 
think consistently while denying the axiom, that two 
things equal to the same thing are equal to each other. 
Yet such axioms can certainly not be proved from 
anything else. They certainly do coincide with our 
experience. They seem to be part, not only of the very 
structure of our minds, but also of the structure of the
-P-A-G-E-123
  
DEDUCTION IN MATHEMATICS 115 
universe to which thousands of years of biological ex- 
perience has adapted the mind of man. Mathematics 
can go no further than to attempt to analyze these 
fundamental axioms, and to make certain that they 
are really ultimate and cannot be shown to follow from 
any simpler notions. 
Hence, because in mathematics we have to start with 
certain terms undefined, and because we have to assume 
that certain beliefs are true, Bertrand Russell has de- 
fined that study as ‘‘the science in which we never know 
what we are talking about nor whether what we are say- 
ingis true.’ Weare dealing with abstractions from our 
world, not with that world as we actually experience it, 
and we can never prove, as the mathematician proves 
his propositions that the world in which we live is any- 
thing like that described by such abstract thinking. 
Hence we find that, while those who have seen in 
mathematics the ideal of knowledge thoroughly and 
conclusively tested are right, that certainty is possi- 
ble only because we first put it into our definitions. It 
is a certainty within a highly abstracted realm, not a 
certainty in the world we experience. To ascertain just 
how valid any mathematical formula will be as an inter- 
pretation of the way things are in the world, we have to 
rely upon the tests that repeated experiment and verifi- 
cation will bring, just as does any other scientist. We 
have abundant proof that in this sense mathematics is 
marvelously borne out as describing accurately certain 
aspects of our experience. And that is why it is the 
wonderful tool and instrument that it is in the hands of 
the scientist who knows how to use it. As Descartes 
said three hundred years ago, nature is like a great ci- 
pher to be solved by man. We invent a key to the code,
-P-A-G-E-124
  116 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
and we find that the interpretation makes excellent 
sense. No wonder we feel proud of our ingenuity and 
satisfied with our key. 
Section 6. The Essentials of Good Mathematical 
Thinking 
We can now summarize the characteristics we have 
discovered that good mathematical thinking must pos- 
sess. Since so much depends on our initial assumptions, 
we must be exceedingly careful to make them as clear as 
possible. Our definitions must be absolutely clear-cut, 
that we may know exactly what kind of things we are 
talking about. We must know precisely what our as- 
sumptions are, and both definitions and assumptions 
must express the essential nature of the realm in which 
we are operating; that is, it must be possible to prove from 
them the entire body of beliefs making up the science. 
This goal, it must be said, has not yet been fully reached 
by the mathematician. With these tools at our disposal 
it will be possible for us to test thoroughly every math- 
ematical belief, and to make certain that it follows from 
the assumptions with which we started. But to dis- 
cover whether there is in reality anything like those 
ideal entities about which we have proved so many 
things, we must adopt an entirely different kind of rea- 
soning. That is the province of the careful experimen- 
tation whose principles we have already examined. All 
that mathematics can do is to tell us that, if certain 
things are true, then we can be quite certain of the truth 
of other things. It remains purely hypothetical. But 
as such it is an invaluable instrument for the deductive 
elaboration of the various theories and suggestions that 
occur as explanations to the scientist. It is with the

nature of these explanations themselves that our next

CHAPTER VI 
THE FUNCTION OF EXPLANATION IN PHYSICS 
Section 1. Explanation by Analogy 
WE have now taken up in turn each of the stages of the 
typical act of reflective thinking, and have examined the 
methods by which the scientist guards against the possi- 
bility of error at each step and arrives at the truth he is 
seeking. We have followed his hypothesis from its birth 
among the multitude of facts and observations he has 
made, through its gradual shaping and testing in ac- 
cordance with the criteria of a good hypothesis and the 
five inductive canons, and its complex deductive elabo- 
ration at the hands of the mathematician. It now re- 
mains to consider a little more closely the nature of the 
scientist’s aim and the extent of his achievement in mar- 
shaling hosts of facts under the banner of a scientific 
law. The discovery of these causal laws we have as- 
sumed to be the chief task of the investigator; now we 
must ask just what these causal laws really tell us. Al- 
though it is in their ability to serve as instruments of 
prediction that the practical utility of these laws con- 
sists, their essential value to the inquiring mind lies in 
enabling it to wnderstand the world in which it finds it- 
self, and to explain its events. 
Because this function of explaining our world to us isso 
fundamental to science, and because so many men have 
been led astray through not knowing just what scien- 
tists were attempting to do in this explaining, we shall se- 
lect from the great realm over which the physicist holds
-P-A-G-E-128
  120 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
sway this one problem of the nature and meaning of 
scientific explanation. Through the consideration of a 
single phenomenon to be explained, we shall show how 
physicists have come gradually to adopt certain beliefs 
about that thing because they feel that they are thus 
“explaining” it much better than they formerly did. 
When a man has beheld something new and strange, 
and returns to inform his friends, they ask him eagerly, 
“Tell us all about it. Explain it to us. What is it 
like?” And in his explanation he does tell them what 
it is like, for he describes it in terms of the things with 
which they are already familiar. Nor does the scientist 
do otherwise. When he seeks to explain a certain phe- 
nomenon, he too sets out to tell us what it is like. If it is 
some newly observed occurrence, he seeks to show that 
it is really like some other occurrence with which we are 
already familiar, and whose manner of taking place we 
already know. Were the average scientist to formulate 
his ideal, it would probably be that of showing that all 
the complex occurrences in our world are at bottom not 
dissimilar and different events, but that fundamentally 
they are all special cases of some more general type 
of happening. Did we know the laws describing how 
this one great type of event takes place, and could we 
show that everything that comes to pass really falls un- 
der these laws, then, so far as most scientists are con- 
cerned, we should have explained everything in the 
world. Thus most psychologists are seeking to ‘“‘re- 
duce”’ the mental phenomena with which they deal to 
the more general laws of physiology, and thus ‘‘ex- 
plain” the unfamiliar mental happenings in terms of 
familiar physiological principles; most physiologists are 
seeking to ‘‘reduce” their physiological laws to special
-P-A-G-E-129
  NATURE IN EXPLANATION 121 
cases of the more general and better known laws of 
chemistry and physics; while the chemists and the phys- 
icists are busily engaged in the attempt to show that 
all the phenomena of their sciences ultimately depend 
solely upon the laws of matter and energy — perhaps 
of energy alone. For that is what they mean by ‘‘ex- 
plaining.” 
Of course, the scientists have not yet been success- 
ful in their attempt to ‘‘explain” all phenomena as 
essentially happenings in the domain of the science of 
mechanics; many, in fact, feel that this is probably an 
impossible task, while some few even question its desira- 
bility. Yet it remains the ideal of what the average scien- 
tist would like to do if he could, for he feels that he can 
“understand” any type of occurrence only when he has 
shown that, instead of being something very complex 
and unique, it is really the combination of things that are 
very simple and universal. Thus the astronomer, when 
confronted with the millions of quite unrelated tiny or- 
bits of the stars, even though he might be able to work 
out on the epicycle theory the positions where they 
could be depended upon to be at any particular time, 
could never on that theory feel that he understood why 
the stars had such curious habits. He could take ac- 
count of the observed facts, but he would be able to ez- 
plain them only when he realized that those habits de- 
pended upon the simple orbital motion of the earth 
about the sun. All those complexly varying motions 
would then be seen to be merely the result of the simple 
path of the earth and the direction whence the light 
came. 
Now in the world with which the physicist deals, the 
profusion of different kinds of occurrence is far greater,
-P-A-G-E-130
    122 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
There is an almost infinite number of different sorts of 
physical objects, water, air, earth, trees, houses, trains, 
animals, cats, granite hills, snow, mosquitoes. Each of 
these things differs from all the rest in fundamental qual- 
ities. Some are cold,some are hot, some are brown, some 
are slimy, some are loud, some are heavy, some are brit- 
tle, some are magnetic. All these things are constantly 
changing their colors, their sounds, their temperatures, 
their shapes, their weights, their positions. Amidst all 
this multiplicity of differences, how are we to find any- 
thing that we can count upon? How are we to explain 
anything, to understand anything in all this welter? 
To the physicist, this hurly-burly does not seem to be 
aconfusion. Rather it seems the soul of orderliness and 
regularity. He has discovered so much of order in this 
seeming disorder that he can calmly assure us that there 
is none of these things that he does not in some measure 
understand. For nearly every change that we observe 
he is ready with an explanation showing just why that 
change took place, and just what change will occur next. 
Does a hunter elevate his gun and bring down a duck? 
Then our physicist can tell us exactly the path of the shot, 
the fall of the bird. Does the sixteen-inch gun discharge 
a shell at an invisible target? He can tell us just where 
it will land, how long it will take, how hot it will be, how 
great a force drove it, and almost any other question 
we may choose to ask. Does something go wrong with 
the storage battery in ourcar? He can tell us what 
has been happening in that little black box, and what 
the trouble is. Most of the events of nature find him 
unsurprised, for he knows what to expect. For nearly 
every one he can give some kind of reason and explana- 
tion. He has found that things happen in certain fixed
-P-A-G-E-131
  
NATURE IN EXPLANATION 128 
and invariable ways, and that when he has discovered 
what those ways are, he has the key to every phenome- 
non that belongs in that class. For after all the com- 
plexities of nature do seem intelligible in terms of a 
comparatively few simple elementary processes, and the 
physical laws which explain many of her aspects and 
enable us to calculate them with uncanny accuracy, 
could readily be formulated in the compass of a small 
manual. And every new discovery is a further simplifi- 
cation, until it seems almost possible that the ideal of the 
physicist, some all-comprehensive formula from which 
could be predicted every possible event in the world of 
nature, may not be absolutely unattainable. 
Whether he reach such a goal or not, it is in achieving 
such explanations that he has won his greatest triumphs. 
One by one he has been reducing complex happenings to 
simpler ones, and involved laws and formulas to simpler 
and more general forms. We shall take a single exam- 
ple to show the kind of thing that he has aimed at, and 
the wonderful success that has crowned his efforts. 
Then we shall examine more closely into just how the 
new scientific explanation “explains” the events with 
which it deals, and what that “explanation” really 
means. 
Section 2. The Scholastic Theory of the Nature of 
Physical Objects 
It is hardly too much to say that during the Middle 
Ages the world had no scientific explanations of those 
happenings with which the modern physicist deals. To 
the greatest minds as well as to the average man the 
world of natural objects was just what it seemed to be 
and nothing more. Every object in the physical world 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  124 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
was just an object of a certain character, quite distinct 
from all the other objects. Each was a real substance; 
that is, in the technical definition, each was able to exist 
by itself. Each substance possessed certain qualities. 
It was green, it was flexible, it was damp, it was of a cer- 
tain size, it weighed so many pounds. If any of these 
qualities changed, the object was no longer the same 
substance. Substances frequently disappeared alto- 
gether, as when one applied a flame to a piece of wood. 
The wood vanished, leaving only a little of a new sub- 
stance, ashes, in its place. Or again substances fre- 
quently just happened, as when one found dew where a 
few moments before there had been none. These quali- 
tative differences were real. Ice was one substance, 
water another, steam a third. If you heated water, it 
would be transformed into steam, an entirely new kind 
of substance. If you mixed copper and zine, you got a 
new substance, brass, that was gold in so far as its color 
went. If you could thus transform copper into gold in 
color, why not in its other qualities also? Nothing was 
more common than the everyday transmutation of wood 
into ashes, or of water into steam through the addition 
of two other substances, flame or fire, and heat, respec- 
tively. 
This glorification of common sense served the Middle 
Ages well enough, because they were not very much con- 
cerned with either understanding or predicting physical 
phenomena. But so soon as men came to feel an inter- 
est in doing this latter thing, the method that the scho- 
lastics had developed for handling objects broke down, 
because it explained nothing. For the scholastic, noth- 
ing was just like anything else. Each kind of object 
possessed its own character and individuality, each was
-P-A-G-E-133
NATURE IN EXPLANATION 126 
qualitatively different from its fellows. This way of 
looking at objects had been developed primarily for 
dealing with human beings, where character and in- 
dividuality are obviously the most important things 
to be considered. But unfortunately for the physical 
science of the Middle Ages, methods admirable in deal- 
ing with human relations bear little fruit when applied 
to material objects, and the heavy hand of Aristotle’s 
ethical physics lay for fifteen hundred years upon nat- 
ural science, and drove out other hypotheses that would 
have been much more successful. One could make no 
statements about more than one class of objects, be- 
cause between classes there were no relations of similar- 
ity that would lend themselves to generalization. Cold 
water was one kind of thing, hot water another, and the 
difference was due to the presence in the case of the 
latter of a new substance or thing, heat. Why did 
heat make things hot? Because heat possessed very 
strong calorific qualities. Why, in the classic instance, 
did opium put one to sleep? Because of its well-known 
dormitive qualities. The operation of any particular 
substance was always explained as due to something in 
that substance which was unique to it, and which made 
it do exactly what it did. 
Modern scientists are accustomed to laugh at these 
pseudo- ‘‘explanations” as mere attempts to cover igno- 
rance. That is because they do not realize what the scho- 
lastics were doing. They were pointing to and recording 
observed facts, and the various qualities with which 
they saddled unoffending materials were scientific labels 
indicating the presence of those facts. This observation 
of facts is the indispensable prerequisite to any scientific 
explanation of them. Until you know that heat makes
-P-A-G-E-134
  126 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
an object hot, you can never hope to explain why it per- 
forms that function. Without knowing what the case is, 
you can scarcely show what else it is like. These ob- 
served facts, as we saw in astronomy, heap up for cen- 
turies before men can explain and account for them. 
Every new science has multitudes of just such facts, 
neatly labeled and awaiting the pathfinder who will em- 
brace them all in one great hypothesis. Such labeling is 
dangerous only if we forget that it is merely labeling, 
and assume that the label itself is a real explanation. 
Thus, for example, many psychologists to-day, when 
asked to explain why human beings like to be in each 
other’s company, and dislike solitude, answer readily, 
“Oh, that is due to the gregarious instinct.” If they 
imagine that they have given a real explanation, that 
they have clarified a complex phenomenon by reducing 
it to one simpler, they are in the position of those who 
explain the heat-giving nature of heat as due to its 
calorific qualities. But if they say, ‘‘We don’t know 
why human beings behave in that particular way, but 
we know that they do, and we think that fact so impor- 
tant that we will call it the gregarious instinct,” then 
they are paving the way for the pathfinder who is to 
overcome their ignorance. 
Section 8. The Kinetic Theory of Matter 
In striking contrast to the theory of the scholastics, 
that each physical object is qualitatively different from 
all the other kinds, and observes its own particular hab- 
its in accordance with its own individual nature, is the 
view known as the kinetic theory. It assumes that all 
objects are composed of a great number of tiny particles 
or molecules, of a certain small and definite number of
-P-A-G-E-135
NATURE IN EXPLANATION 127 
kinds, and that the marvelous qualitative diversity we 
find in our world is due to the different ways in which 
these particles are combined, or are behaving. Thus, if 
this hypothesis be true, we have a really scientific ex- 
planation of multitudes of the phenomena we observe, 
because we can interpret them as consequences of eer- 
tain simple relations obtaining between these particles. 
The laws describing the actions of these particles we 
already know, for they are the same as those governing 
the motions of the heavenly bodies. We are familiar 
with what happens when two billiard balls strike each 
other. If we can show that all the complex phenomena 
of gases and liquids and solids and pressure and heat, 
and many others, can be treated as if they were cases of 
a certain number of billiard balls of a certain size strik- 
ing each other at a certain velocity and with a certain 
frequency, we have achieved a marvelous result in show- 
ing that all these varied events are really like the me- 
chanical action and reaction with which we are already 
familiar. We can apply mathematical formule to me- 
chanical motions, and predict with the utmost exacti- 
tude exactly what will occur in a given case. And just 
in so far as we can show that different temperatures, 
different pressures, different forms of matter, different 
phenomena of all sorts, are really dependent upon the 
different velocities with which our tiny billiard balls are 
traveling, we can make similar predictions about them. 
We have attained a real explanation, because we have 
succeeded in reducing happenings that we did not under- 
stand, and that were qualitatively different, and hence 
not susceptible of mathematical or quantitative han- 
dling, to happenings the laws of which we do know, and 
which, since they depend upon quantitative differences
-P-A-G-E-136
  
  128 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
in velocity, we can handle by means of mathematical 
formule. Thus, if we know that water is composed of 
certain molecules, and that, when these are vibrating at 
certain rates, it remains a liquid, but that, when, in 
general, the rate of vibration falls below a certain level, 
it becomes a solid, ice, and when the rate rises above a 
certain level, it becomes a gas, steam, we have really 
explained these changes as we never could have had we 
assumed the difference to be due to the addition or sub- 
traction of a substance, heat, and the changes to be real 
transmutations. 
The aim, then, of the kinetic theory is to give a math- 
ematical account in terms of the mechanical action of 
the molecules of which matter is composed, of all the 
non-chemical and non-electrical properties of things. 
It endeavors to reduce all objects to the fundamental 
elements of matter and energy, and to interpret the 
various changes that they undergo in terms of the laws 
of motion, or mechanics, of geometry, and of arithmetic. 
Hence it is the attempt to find one simple explanation 
for all those properties which are not chemical or elec- 
trical. The reason for this exception of the two latter 
kinds of properties is that the molecule, which is the 
ultimate element with which the physicist is dealing, is 
itself complex, made up of atoms which are in turn 
composed of electrons, and that while in most cases we 
can disregard the particular chemical kind of molecule, 
and treat of ‘‘matter” indiscriminately, in certain cases 
we must take into consideration the particular sort 
of molecule with which we are working. Thus the 
chemical properties of objects are dependent upon the 
internal nature and structure of the molecules, whereas 
the electrical properties seem to depend rather upon the  
-P-A-G-E-137
  
NATURE IN EXPLANATION 129 
structure of the atom and its component electrons. Just 
inso far as the scientist has not succeeded in eliminating 
all qualitative differences, and hence just in so far as he 
must know with which chemical element or combination 
of elements he is dealing in order to explain his results, he 
has not succeeded in his aim of finding one simple princi- 
ple of explanation for all phenomena. It is, however, 
very significant that most chemists at the present time 
feel sure that the atoms themselves, which we used to 
think were qualitatively distinct elements, of some 
eighty odd varieties, are really combinations of a simpler 
thing, the electron, and that these differences of kind are 
explicable as merely differences of quantitative structure. 
The ultimate constituent of matter, so far as we are able 
to discover at present, is the electron — or perhaps the 
positive nucleus of the atom, the “proton” — and here 
at last scientists seem to have discovered a thing that 
isallofonesort. It is already the dream of many scien- 
tists that, when we have once discovered the laws de- 
scribing the nature and behavior of the electron, we shall 
have a principle of explanation that will enable us to 
understand every possible occurrence in the world of 
nature. 
However, it would take us too far afield to enter into 
this question of the component parts of molecules, and 
hence we shall restrict ourselves in our example to a 
phenomenon which the kinetic hypothesis, without 
drawing on any further theories about atoms or elec- 
trons, enables us to explain beautifully. 
Section 4. The Nature of Heat 
The fact that some bodies are hotter than others, and 
that the same body can vary greatly in temperature, was  
-P-A-G-E-138
  130 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
one of the first observations that men made. They also 
soon found that, if heat is applied to most bodies, those 
bodies expand, and that, if you add enough heat, solids 
will be changed into liquids and liquids into gases. Why 
is this so? How can we explain these events? Just 
what is this thing “‘heat”’? From the earliest times, 
men sought an explanation of these happenings. And 
quite naturally they assumed that “heat” was a thing, 
a substance, a fluid like other fluids, that possessed the 
qualities we associate with “hotness” and that caused 
certain changes in bodies to which it was added. It 
could penetrate, expand, dissolve into fluids, and dissi- 
pate into gases. This heat fluid was by early physicists 
given the name of ‘“‘caloric.”” Now this theory is a real 
explanation of the various phenomena connected with 
heat, because it does interpret them in accordance with 
certain other types of event with which we are already 
familiar. Adding caloric to a body will naturally in- 
crease its size, just as adding any fluid to another in- 
creases the total volume. It will turn solids into new 
liquids, just as water will turn salt into brine. With 
these latter occurrences we are familiar, and, when heat 
is explained as working like them, we can understand 
them better. 
This was as far as men were able to go so long as they 
had no means of measuring quantitatively differences in 
temperature. It is a testimony to the complete de- 
pendence of science upon mathematical measurement 
that no science of heat could develop until the thermom- 
eter was invented, about 1612. Strictly speaking, of 
course, we cannot measure ‘‘hotness,’’ any more than we 
can measure any other quality. We cannot tell how 
much hotter we feel to-day than we did yesterday. We 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
  NATURE IN EXPLANATION 181 
can only measure the results of heat in expanding mer- 
cury, alcohol, or some other fluid. But once we have in- 
vented a thermometer, and can take exact measure- 
ments of these results, we can proceed to establish defi- 
nite quantitative relations; and so soon as the physicists 
did do this, they found a number of phenomena, that 
the caloric or fluid theory of heat had great difficulty in 
solving. 
Most important were the heat of compression, and the 
heat of friction. When you compress a gas it becomes 
much hotter than before, as any one who has ever 
pumped up a tire knows. Where does this heat come 
from? Notfrom outside, as in most other cases of a 
rise in temperature, because the surroundings do not 
become cooler, as they would if some caloric passed into 
the gas. It must come from inside the gas itself, and 
hence, if caloric is a fluid, it must have been there all 
along without our knowing it. Similarly, where does 
the heat that appears when two bodies are rubbed to- 
gether come from? It also must have been hidden in 
the bodies. If caloric is fluid, it must be able to lie la- 
tent or hidden within bodies on occasion. The explana- 
tion which the calorists offered of the appearance of heat 
on friction or compression was that some of this “‘la- 
tent”’ caloric was squeezed or ground out of the bodies 
concerned and became “‘sensible” or apparent. Ob- 
viously, if such was the case, if you rubbed long enough 
you would eventually reach a limit to the calorie you 
could rub out, because the supply could hardly be infi- 
nite. In a work published in 1798 Benjamin Thomp- 
son, Count Rumford, described how he endeavored to 
find how much he could extract. He placed a metal 
cannon in a box containing water, and, by the friction
-P-A-G-E-140
  
  132 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
of a blunt revolving borer driven by horse-power, the 
water was heated to boiling in two and a half hours. 
There seemed no limit to the calorie he could produce. 
He exclaimed, ‘What is heat? Is there any such 
thing as a caloric fluid?... Anything which any in- 
sulated body, or system of bodies, can continue to fur- 
nish without limitation, cannot possibly be a material 
substance; and it appears to me to be extremely difficult, 
if not quite impossible, to form any distinct idea of any- 
thing, capable of being excited, and communicated, in 
the manner the heat was excited and communicated in 
these experiments, except it be MOTION.” 
The next year Sir Humphry Davy performed an even 
more conclusive experiment. A considerable amount 
of heat must be applied to ice in order to melt it, so that 
on the caloric theory water contains a much greater 
quantity of caloric fluid than does ice: that is, ice in it- 
self does not contain enough caloric to melt it. Davy 
rubbed two blocks of ice together by clock-work in a 
vacuum, and succeeded in melting them easily. On the 
fluid theory the caloric could only have come from the 
ice, and it was an observed fact that ice did not contain 
enough heat to melt itself. Both of these experiments, 
it may be noted, were applications of the Method of 
Difference. 
Just what had these two experiments proved? They 
pointed out two observed facts about heat that the cal- 
oric fluid hypothesis was unable to account for. When 
dealing with them, it made matters more difficult rather 
than easier to understand for one to assume that the ac- 
tion of heat was like the ordinary action of a fluid added 
toabody. Hence they conclusively disproved that hy- 
pothesis. But, of course, they could not establish of

NATURE IN EXPLANATION 183 
themselves any alternative hypothesis. So far as the 
theory of heat as due to molecular activity could explain 
these two observed facts, as well as all the other phe- 
nomena of heat, it was a better hypothesis than its 
rival; but perhaps still another was even better. The 
establishment of the kinetic theory depended upon fur- 
ther experiments, and, significantly enough, these were 
impossible until physicists had learned enough about the 
behavior of gases to formulate the kinetic hypothesis 
in definite quantitative terms capable of exact verifica- 
tion. Thus again does physics depend upon mathe- 
matics. 
The honor of placing the kinetic theory of heat 
upon a sound experimental basis belongs almost exclu- 
sively to the Englishman J.P. Joule. He elaborated 
the consequences of that theory, and then actually dis- 
covered by physical measurements in his laboratory that 
those consequences did take place. If heat is not a fluid, 
but is rather the energy of molecular motion within a 
body, and if those molecular movements take place in 
accordance with the ordinary mechanical laws of motion, 
then, when mechanical energy is expended upon a body, 
say through pressure upon a gas, and is transformed into 
heat, or the increased motion of the molecules within 
that body, the energy which disappeared in the act of 
compression should exactly equal the energy which ap- 
pears in the increased motion of the molecules, or heat. 
Conversely, the energy of molecular motion which dis- 
appears when a gas expands again (or the heat which it 
loses on expansion) should reappear as mechanical work 
done by that expansion. For on the molecular theory 
we are dealing not with two different kinds of energy, me- 
chanical energy, or the ability to perform work, and an 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  
  134 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
energy of a different sort entirely, heat, but rather with 
mechanical energy on two different scales, the motion 
of large bodies; and the motion of very small bodies, or 
molecules. In other words, the theory could not be re- 
garded as complete until it had been shown that, in the 
production of work from heat, a certain quantity of heat 
disappeared, and ceased to exist as heat; and that this 
quantity was the same as that which could be generated 
by the expenditure of the work produced. 
This actual quantitative determination of what is 
called the “‘mechanical equivalent”’ of heat was the task 
of Joule, and in experimentally verifying that equiva- 
lence he conclusively demonstrated the whole kinetic 
theory of heat. For he succeeded in showing that heat 
could be regarded as mechanical motion on a small scale, 
and that it obeyed the laws of all motion. To this end 
he instituted a number of different experiments. He 
measured the heat produced by the expenditure of a 
certain amount of electrical energy, and found that it 
was constant. He measured the heat produced by the ex- 
penditure of a certain amount of mechanical energy in 
compressing a gas, and found that it was exactly equal 
to the heat produced by the same amount of electrical 
energy. He found also that that same amount of heat, 
when converted back into mechanical energy, produced 
the amount that had originally been expended in creating 
it. He found that the results so obtained tallied exactly 
with results when he produced heat by friction. He tried 
also a number of other experiments, varying his meth- 
ods greatly each time, and in every case he established 
the same definite ratio between the amount of heat and 
the amount of work performed. The great value of 
Joule’s work lay in the variety and the completeness of
-P-A-G-E-143
  NATURE IN EXPLANATION 135 
the experimental evidence he brought forth. It was 
not, of course, sufficient to find the relation between 
heat and mechanical work in one particular case. He 
had to show, to fulfill the requirements of the Method of 
Agreement, that the same relation held in all cases that 
could be experimentally examined, and that the “‘ratio 
of equivalence” of the different forms of energy, meas- 
ured in very different ways, was independent of the 
manner in which the conversion was effected and of the 
material used. Since Joule’s day many more experi- 
ments have been devised, and in every case the same re- 
sult has been secured. 
Why, then, did physicists adopt the kinetic theory 
of heat? Because they found that they could thus re- 
duce all the different phenomena of heat to a single sim- 
ple basis, the energy of motion of the molecules compos- 
ing bodies, and because that motion was itself of pre- 
sisely the same nature, and obeyed precisely the same 
laws as does any motion in the universe. It is a marvel- 
ous achievement in scientific explanation when we can 
confidently assert that the tremendous movements of 
the heavenly bodies and the qualitative differences in 
temperature of the tiniest objects are both alike, and 
that they are together like the simple and easily under- 
stood and predicted movements of two billiard balls 
striking each other. One formula will describe all three. 
Surely few achievements of the human mind are worthy 
to rank with such a feat! 
Of course, the kinetic theory of matter, though it 
was originally developed as an explanation of heat, does 
not stop with that phenomenon. There are probably 
few other hypotheses in the history of science that have 
proved so extremely fruitful. Men, assuming its truth,
-P-A-G-E-144
  136 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
have made detailed calculations about what must then 
occur, and on experimental verification have made mul- 
titudes of new discoveries as to the nature of events. 
Nothing has as yet been observed that has not already 
been predicted on this basis with uncanny accuracy. 
Men have proceeded to measure the weight of the mole- 
cules, their volume, their size, their speed, the distance 
they travel, the number of collisions a second, and the 
number actually within a given space. Almost the only 
thing the physicist cannot tell us is the precise shape of 
the molecules. The physicist can well-nigh point under 
the microscope to actual molecular motions themselves, 
and enable us almost to see the molecules in their vibra- 
tion; for he can show us in the so-called ‘‘ Brownian 
Movement,” the irregular and jerky motions of tiny 
particles that are the direct result of the terrific bom- 
bardment to which they are submitted on the part of 
the molecules. And all of these things which the physi- 
cist, basing his calculations on the kinetic theory, has 
been able to predict, have been borne out exactly by 
experiment and observation. It is this remarkable 
correlation between the results of the kinetic theory 
and the experimentally determined facts of nature that 
constitutes the real ‘‘proof”’ of the theory. 
This, then, is an admirable example of what the scien- 
tist means by “‘explanation,” this reduction of things so 
qualitatively different as the varying temperatures and 
states of bodies to the simple terms of matter and the 
energy of motion. But just what has he done in this 
“explanation” ? What has he, after all, proved about 
heat? What have we the right to expect from scientific 
explanation, anyway? In how far and in what way is it 
“valid” ? Isit the only possible kind of “explanation” ?
-P-A-G-E-145
  NATURE IN EXPLANATION 137 
All of these questions are so extremely important that 
we shall devote our concluding section to a considera- 
tion of the problems they suggest. 
Section 5. The Nature of “Explanation” 
Just what has the physicist accomplished when he has , 
“explained” heat as a form of molecular energy? This 
question may perhaps appear somewhat unnecessary, 
for most of us would feel that the answer was obvious. 
Yet upon precisely this point there have arisen so many 
misconceptions and misunderstandings, and so many 
men, both laymen and scientists, have felt firmly con- 
vinced that they have accomplished much more than 
they actually have, that it is extremely important that 
we determine clearly the exact nature of the scien- 
tist’s achievement. Nothing unfortunately is more 
common than for a man to attempt a detailed and elab- 
orate proof of some hypothesis, and to establish that 
hypothesis successfully, and then suddenly to lose en- 
tirely all of his critical faculties when it comes to inter- 
preting the meaning and significance of that successfully 
tested and verified theory. This latter task seems, in 
fact, usually much more difficult than the former, and 
perhaps there are many more men who can place an hy- 
pothesis upon a firm foundation than there are those 
who can use that achieved knowledge correctly for the 
attainment of further knowledge. It is a frequent ex- 
perience for two men to argue very hotly over a certain 
contention that one of them has made, and then, when 
that contention has been finally grudgingly admitted, 
for the other to cut the ground from under the feet of his 
adversary by pointing out that really this special con- 
tention has little bearing on the main question at issue.  
-P-A-G-E-146
  138 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
The greatest scientists have at times given the results 
they have actually discovered significance and further 
implications which those results will not bear. For ex- 
ample, take the case of the theory of biological evolu- 
tion with which we shall be concerned in the next chap- 
ter. When that hypothesis was first generally received 
a generation ago, many men felt that if the present spe- 
cies had originated through the long process of natural 
selection, that fact conclusively disproved their creation 
by God. It should be obvious that, whatever the indi- 
rect effect of the Darwinian theory may have been, a de- 
scription of the various steps in the process of creation 
can neither confirm nor invalidate that process itself. 
Perhaps, then, it is best to clear away some of these 
misconceptions as to the real nature of ‘‘explanation” 
at the outset, and to preface our account of what ‘“‘ex- 
planation” does with a list of the things that it does 
not do. 
In the first place, it ought to be obvious that, al- 
though we have explained heat as a form of molecular 
energy, and have found means of measuring that energy 
accurately, we have in no wise altered the fact that some 
bodies are hot and some are cold. The scientist uses in 
this connection a phrase that is very apt to lead to mis- 
understanding, and that has caused incalculable confu- 
sion in interpreting the significance of his results. He tells 
us that he has succeeded in “‘ reducing”’ the qualitative 
and unmeasurable differences between more and less hot 
to purely quantitative differences that can be accurately 
measured, and that hence lend themselves readily to 
mathematical calculation and prediction. He tells us 
that he has succeeded in “‘reducing” all the varied colors 
that meet our eye in a sunset to tiny electro-magnetic 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
  NATURE IN EXPLANATION 139 
vibrations of various determinable lengths. He may even 
claim to have ‘‘reduced”’ the highest manifestations of 
ethical activity in man, such as the sacrifice of one’s life 
for an idea, to a process that can be described in these 
terms: “‘It might be possible that under the influence of 
certain ideas chemical changes, for instance, internal se- 
cretions within the body, are produced which increase 
the sensitiveness to certain stimuli to such an unusual 
degree that such people become slaves to certain stimuli 
just as the copepods [tiny little crawfish-like creatures] 
become slaves to the light when carbon dioxide is added 
to the water.’’! Now, in so far as this process of ‘‘re- 
duction’’ means the getting rid of something with which 
we started, and in so far as the scientist in using the 
phrase means to imply that as a result of his discoveries 
we now know that hot objects are not really hot, but 
only vibrating rapidly, or that the sunset is not really a 
blaze of color, but only complex wave-motions, or that 
the man is not really manifesting the highest ethical ac- 
tivity, but only responding to chemical stimuli — in so 
far as he allows this notion to creep into his mind, he is 
very obviously talking nonsense. The term ‘‘reduc- 
tion” is a technical one that originates in mathematics, 
and means the transformation of one equation into an- 
other, usually, though not always, simpler, by means of 
the ordinary algebraic processes. This mathematical 
“reduction” is usually performed for the purpose of 
greater convenience in handling, and that very fact sug- 
gests the reason why the physicist does a somewhat anal- 
ogous thing in dealing with his complexities. But one 
outstanding difference between the world of the actually 
existent in which the physicist works, and the non-exist- 
1 Loeb, Mechanistic Conception of Life, p. 62.
-P-A-G-E-148
  140 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
ent or hypothetical world in which the mathematician is 
at home, lies in just this fact, that in the latter one equa- 
tion is as good as another, and can be substituted for the 
other, whereas in the former, though for purposes of con- 
venience we must perform this ‘‘reduction,”’ we can 
never take away a single iota from the actual world with 
which we commenced. The geometer starts with as- 
sumptions which he can change at will; the physical 
scientist starts from facts which nothing can ever 
change. It is so easy to forget this simple truth that it 
cannot be insisted upon too strongly. 
What the scientist has really done is to establish a cer- 
tain definite relation between certain changes in molecu- 
lar motion and corresponding changes in the degree of 
heat. We know that when the mercury column is of one 
length, we can experience a certain degree of hotness; 
and that when it becomes shorter we shall get cooler. 
But no one would say that the mercury column is the 
hotness,or that the rapid movement of molecules is that 
phenomenon we call heat. When we say that water 
is hot, we may know perfectly the mass, volume, veloc- 
ity, and path of the component molecules, but that is 
not what we mean by that statement. We mean by 
that hotness something that both the upholders of the 
calorific and the molecular explanations of heat, or any 
child with no explanation at all, would all recognize as a 
fundamental fact of experience. Nor are all the king’s 
horses and all the king’s men able to alter the fact that 
hot things are hot, and sunsets colored, and men laying 
down their lives for an idea truly moral. The scientist, 
in his explaining of these phenomena, has not taken 
away from them a jot or a tittle; he has merely added 
a great many things. He has discovered that bodies
-P-A-G-E-149
  NATURE IN EXPLANATION 141 
which are hot are not only hot, but that they are in ad- 
dition composed of rapidly moving particles. He has 
added new facts, and has not, as he may fondly think, 
robbed us of any we possessed before. He has cor- 
related molecular velocities with degrees of heat, and 
this established relation has proved, as we have seen, 
immensely fruitful. He can measure those velocities, 
where he could not measure heat directly. He can 
calculate with them, he can predict with them, he can 
bring a whole series of phenomena within the scope of a 
few simple formule. But the fact that we have found 
out just how much hotter it is to-day than it was yes- 
terday can never alter the fact that it is hotter. 
Moreover, the molecular explanation, in introducing 
the same underlying notion of motion into a number of 
different physical happenings, and in showing that all 
these happenings can be grouped together because of 
the fact that all possess this motion, does not alter the 
great differences that do exist between them. Steam is 
still a vastly different kind of thing from ice, even if we 
have learned that the molecules of both are composed of 
one atom of oxygen and two of hydrogen. The fact that 
they are both forms of water does not make it a question 
of indifference which we shall use if we want to make ice 
cream or a steamed pudding. Ice and steam are just as 
distinct and act in ways just as different as we ever 
found them to, but we have learned that, in addition, 
for certain chemical purposes they can be used indiffer- 
ently. The fact that heat is discovered to be a form of 
motion does not prejudice its being a very particular and 
special kind. And the fact that human beings dying 
for ideas and copepods moving toward the light may 
have certain characteristics in common is, for most pur-
-P-A-G-E-150
  142 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
poses, of infinitesimal importance compared with the 
enormous gulf that will always remain between them. 
Explanation, then, robs us of no facts; on the con- 
trary, it adds greatly to our possessions. Closely allied 
to this first common misconception, from which even 
scientific pathfinders have by no means been free, is the 
notion that those simple and ultimate things, in terms of 
which every other event is explained, are in some sense 
real, while the complex events and things so explained 
are not real. The analysis of compounds into their ele- 
ments does seem to the human mind to make those ele- 
ments the important things and the compounds fade 
away into the background. That is the reason why a 
good many men have felt called upon to do battle vigor- 
ously against the whole method of explanation by analy- 
sis which is the mainstay of the scientist’s success. To 
them, and also to a great number of scientists, it must 
be confessed, explaining something really does seem to 
mean explaining it away. To explain heat seems to ex- 
plain heat away and leave nothing but molecules. To 
explain the sacred religious experience of a man who 
has walked with God seems to be explaining his religion 
away. Deep down in the processes of men’s minds there 
seems to lurk the feeling, never perhaps put into words, 
that only those things which are simple and cannot be 
further broken up into parts, and which remain the same 
in all the manifold changes of natural events, can be 
in any significant sense ‘‘real.”” Things susceptible of 
change, things which come into being and decay, which 
suffer the mutability of temporal existence, do seem less 
real, less cosmically important, than those things which 
are able to preserve their own integrity against the en- 
croachments of time, and to enjoy the blessings of eter- 
   
-P-A-G-E-151
NATURE IN EXPLANATION 143 
nal life. Hence it is perhaps natural that scientists 
| should speak of ‘‘the gross world of matter in bulk, 
which is all that our unaided senses can perceive,” and 
turn with admiration to ‘‘the real world, the world of 
molecules.” 
“The One remains, the many change and pass,” 
and for that reason the many are flitting shadows and 
the One alone is real. That men instinctively feel this, 
it is impossible to deny, and hence it is probably just 
to say, “It would ill become science to deny the real- 
ity of things with which it has no concern. But it has 
most definitely, but at the same time unconsciously, 
limited itself now to the recognition of only those ex- 
istences which appear to obey the law of conservation, 
and for which, therefore, there is this much of proof of 
reality.” + 
Deep as this feeling may be with many, it would be 
difficult to give any rational argument in its favor. 
To say that the only real things in the world are the 
units of matter, energy, and electricity, is to place an 
unusual interpretation on ‘‘real.’”’ Certainly it would 
seem that everything in our experience has a prima facie 
right to be considered real until proved not to be, and 
it seems difficult to maintain the contention that only 
the ultimate simples into which compounds are analyzed 
are real. For obviously, on this criterion, the world of 
molecules could not be the ‘‘real world,” nor could the 
world of atoms, nor, it appears highly probable, the world 
of electrons and ‘‘protons.”’ For all of these it seems are 
themselves compounds, and in time break up into some- 
thing else. If immutability and eternal existence are 
1 The quotations are taken from the otherwise excellent little book of 
Frederick Soddy, Matter and Energy.
-P-A-G-E-152
  144 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
the sole criteria of reality, then no thing at all, but only 
the laws describing the behavior of the various things, 
seem to be able to pass the test, and even their position 
would be in constant jeopardy. And if nothing we 
know about is at all “real,” the distinction between 
“real” and ‘‘unreal’’ becomes meaningless to us. But 
such a distinction obviously exists, and if we try to give 
it up we shall find ourselves making it again with other 
terms. 
It is, then, safe to assert that explaining a thing can in 
no sense explain it away. The thing explained remains 
as ‘‘real’’ as it ever was, and scientists who feel other- 
wise are merely thinking confusedly. Heat may be 
molecular energy, but that does not prevent to-day 
from being a really roasting day. The scientist ana- 
lyzes and explains for the sake of understanding better 
the thing he is explaining, not for the sake of arriving 
somewhere else. Of this error psychology, here as else- 
where, since it is our newest science, furnishes us per- 
haps with our most glaring examples. No mental phe- 
nomenon is so real as that we call ‘‘will.”” Yet the psy- 
chologist is prone to analyze that complex thing into 
its constituent elements, and then calmly to announce 
that, of course, there really is n’t any such thing as will- 
power; there are only a great number of habits and 
tendencies! Nor is it any less clear that it is our ‘‘con- 
science” that keeps us from doing wrong. Yet the 
psychologist, after completing his analysis of that men- 
tal phenomenon, is apt to laugh at those who “‘still be- 
lieve there is such a thing”’! 
It is, to be sure, of the utmost importance to point out 
that there is something permanent in change, and to dis- 
cover what those elements are; but when the scientist
-P-A-G-E-153
NATURE IN EXPLANATION 145 
claims that his explanation in any sense lessens the 
reality of that which he is explaining, he is merely giv- 
ing way to a deeply rooted misconception of the human 
mind. 
Thirdly, the fact that our explanation has not altered 
the facts nor taken anything from them nor made them 
any less real, but has rather left them just as they were 
with the addition of certain new knowledge, is extremely 
important in the bearing it has upon the limitations of 
explanation. For it makes it quite possible to have 
more than one explanation of the same happening, to 
suit different purposes. No one explanation can possibly 
exhaust a given occurrence, because it adds to rather 
than subtracts from it. Thus a man who sees small 
boys making off with his fruit gets red in the face and 
there is a marked rise in his temperature. The explana- 
tion of the physicist is that the molecules in his blood 
have increased their velocity. That of the physiologist is 
that the heart has started to pump the blood through the 
lungs much more rapidly, and that oxidation has greatly 
increased. That of the psychologist is that in response 
to acertain stimulus the instinct of self-defense has been 
evoked with its accompanying emotions; while the com- 
mon man would say that the real explanation was that 
the gentleman had become exceedingly angry at the mis- 
chievous boys. Which of the four is right? Obviously all 
are, for each one is explaining the event in the terms 
that he finds most convenient to work with, and each 
one finds that it is like something quite different from 
that which occurs to his fellows. Moreover, in this case 
it is apparent that for the great majority of men it is the 
last explanation and not the first that is really the sim- 
plest and most illuminating. But the others, and per-
-P-A-G-E-154
  146 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
haps still more, are also explanations, perfectly correct 
and valid in their way, and none conflicts with the rest. 
Each rather adds to our knowledge of the situation, be- 
cause each new thing which it is shown to resemble 
brings into prominence and makes really significant a 
new aspect of the case. 
This is especially important because scientists have 
again and again claimed more for their explanations 
than they really do tell us. They have felt that any one 
explanation, in “reducing” the event to simpler terms, 
has got at its real or essential elements and that no other 
explanation could be equally valid. The reasons why 
this position is erroneous ought now to be apparent. 
And, in particular, the reasons why the explanation 
that the physicist gives of events by no means exhausts 
those events nor makes it impossible for another type of 
explanation to be applied, should be plain. To the phys- 
icist, explaining a natural phenomenon means showing 
that it is like the behavior of certain ultimate units of 
matter and energy. ‘This type of analysis he chooses 
because it is the only way in which he can obtain ele- 
ments that will lend themselves to quantitative and 
mathematical handling, that he can measure and weigh 
and accurately determine in advance. But there are 
many other purposes in life besides this one of the physi- 
cist, and hence there are many other types of explana- 
tion quite as applicable. Scientific explanation is of a 
definite kind determined by the aims of science; it an- 
swers the question, ‘‘ What is this like?’’ in terms of cer- 
tain specific things like objects in motion. It explains 
wholes by analyzing them into their component parts. 
It explains houses as being built out of such and such 
bricks. But it is equally important on occasion to ex-
-P-A-G-E-155
NATURE IN EXPLANATION 147 
plain a brick as the kind of thing houses are made out of, 
even though that explanation be not the kind the physi- 
cist would give. It is certainly as valid to interpret the 
“Why?” of inquiry as meaning ‘‘ What is it for?” as it is 
to interpret it as meaning ‘‘What is it like?” When 
men ask ‘‘Why?”’ they are apt to have a confused notion 
of both types of answer in their minds. When they 
wish an event explained to them, they wish to know both 
what it is like, in what great group of phenomena and 
under what laws it falls, and also for what purpose it 
takes place. The first of these questions the physicist 
attempts to answer; the second lies beyond his province, 
but it is none the less important. 
As an illustration of these different kinds of explana- 
tion, take the case of a man at the automobile show who 
is examining a new engine and wishes the demonstrator 
to explain to him the new valve which he finds in a 
strange place. The demonstrator would answer him in 
several ways. He could show how it opened and closed 
as the cam shaft revolved, and how it was so made 
that it closed very rapidly indeed. This would be de- 
scribing its operation. Or he could tell the inquirer 
how it was made, and describe the various elements 
that went into it. He could go into the matter of its 
origin, and trace how it had come to be there in its 
place. This would be a causal explanation. But he 
would probably do neither of these things. He would 
rather tell the man why it had been put there — what 
good it did there, what function it performed in the 
working of the engine as a whole. And this latter ex- 
planation would not be of the type of the explanation 
of the physicist, because it would be in terms of pur- 
pose, in terms of the engine as a whole, of which it 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  
  148 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
was but a part. Yet it is obviously the most impor- 
tant kind of explanation for the man who wants to run 
the engine. But it does not conflict at all with the 
other explanations. 
This point has been emphasized because historically 
many of the greatest pathfinders have felt that these 
two kinds of explanation really excluded each other. 
They have felt that men must cleave to the one and for- 
sake the other; that men could not serve two masters, 
explanation in terms of simple component elements, and 
explanation in terms of purpose. They have not been 
able to see how the universe could be a great mechanical 
system, capable of mechanical explanation, and at the 
same time be a great whole whose parts could be con- 
ceived to be fulfilling certain purposes, to be for the sake 
of something. They have failed to see how man’s ac- 
tions could be explained both in terms of the purposes 
for which he performs certain acts and the mechanical 
way in which his body acts. If the foregoing discussion 
has made anything clear, it should have served to show 
us that these two kinds of explanation, different as they 
are, are quite compatible. 
A quotation from the great philosopher Plato’s de- 
scription of the death of his teacher Socrates will illus- 
trate this clearly. Socrates is in prison awaiting exe- 
cution, talking to his friends, and he is finding fault 
with the type of explanation given by a scientist of his 
actions:+ 
I might compare him to a person who began by maintain- 
ing generally that mind is the cause of the actions of Socrates, 
but who, when he endeavored to explain the causes of my sev- 
eral actions in detail, went to show that I sit here because my

NATURE IN EXPLANATION 149 
body is made up of bones and of muscles; and the bones, as he 
would say, are hard and have ligaments which divide them, 
and the muscles are elastic, and they cover the bones, which 
have also a covering or environment of flesh and skin which 
contains them; and as the bones are lifted at the joints by the 
contraction or relaxation of the muscles, I am able to bend 
my limbs, and this is why I am sitting here in a curved pos- 
ture: that is what he would say, and he would have a similar 
explanation of my talking to you, which he would attribute to 
sound, and air, and hearing, and he would assign ten thou- 
sand other causes of the same sort, forgetting to mention the 
true cause, which is that the Athenians have thought fit to 
condemn me, and accordingly I have thought it better and 
more right to remain here and undergo my sentence; for I am 
inclined to think these muscles and bones of mine would have 
gone off to Megara or Beeotia — by the dog of Egypt they 
would, if they had been guided only by their own idea of what 
was best, and if I had not chosen as the better and nobler 
part, instead of playing truant and running away, to undergo 
my punishment which the state inflicts. There is surely a 
strange confusion of causes and conditions in all this. It 
may be said, indeed, that without bones and muscles and the 
other parts of the body I cannot execute my purposes. But 
to say that I do as I do because of them, and that this is the 
way in which mind acts, and not from the choice of the best, 
is a very careless and idle mode of speaking. 
In calling his own explanation the true one, Socrates 
is, of course, falling into the same error of exclusiveness 
that he is reproaching in his adversary; yet it is obvious 
that, as an explanation of the conduct of the man in re- 
maining for his death, the scientist’s attempt is futile. 
For ethics differs greatly from a natural science like 
physiology, as we shall see later. Scientific explana- 
tion, then, does not alter or ‘‘reduce’’ an event, but adds 
to our knowledge of what that event is like instead of 
robbing us. It does not explain it away; and it in no 
   
-P-A-G-E-158
    150 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
wise precludes the possibility of a number of other 
equally valid explanations. The importance of these 
considerations will become increasingly obvious as we 
come to those fields in which the physicist’s type of ex- 
planation does not seem to produce especially happy re- 
sults. There we shall see that, because men have failed 
to realize what the physicist was trying to do in his ex- 
planations, and what was the limitation of that particu- 
lar type, they have tried to apply methods quite un- 
suited to those fields, and have succeeded in involving 
themselves in well-nigh inextricable confusion. Perhaps 
these men are themselves chiefly to blame for their 
own failures, but a good many natural scientists have 
great responsibility for their own inability to realize 
the nature and the significance of their own methods. 
In the course of telling what scientific explanation is 
not, we have arrived at a fairly definite idea of what it 
is. It will be necessary only to summarize it briefly here. 
Scientific explanation is telling what a thing or an event 
is like; that is, it is describing it in terms of some other 
type of thing or event with whose ways of happening we 
are already acquainted. If we can discover some sim- 
ple type of happening in whose terms we can describe 
all other manifold events and phenomena, we shall have 
achieved the ideal of such explanation. This the phys- 
icist has almost accomplished when he can understand 
all non-chemical and non-electrical properties of bodies 
in terms of the varying energy of motion of the mole- 
cules of which they are composed. In so far as all phys- 
ical occurrences can be correlated with these molecular 
motions, the physicist is in a position to calculate and 
predict with extreme accuracy and success, and as a 
matter of fact he has found this molecular hypothesis  
-P-A-G-E-159
  NATURE IN EXPLANATION 161 
marvelously fruitful. In particular, it has proved su- 
perior to the old caloric theory of heat in enabling us to 
explain a much greater number of observed phenomena 
in terms of the one simple type of motion, and to predict 
other phenomena which later experiments verified. But 
we must not forget that the scientific type of explana- 
tion by analogy is but one among many possible and, 
depending upon the specific purpose we have in view, 
equally valid kinds. We can explain the electric light 
either by expounding the electro-magnetic theory of 
electricity and light, or by describing the production of 
bulbs in the Mazda factory, or by considering the need 
of man for artificial illumination; and our explanation 
will be analogical, genetic, or purposive according as 
our interest is predominantly that of the physicist, the 
manufacturer, or the interior decorator. 
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
1. Why do we understand events better if we are shown that they re- 
semble something with which we are familiar? How does such 
a resemblance help us to control them? 
2. Does the scientist always choose elements that are familiar by 
which to explain phenomena? Are we more familiar with mole- 
cules or with heat? Give further illustrations. 
3. What were the aims of the medieval scientists in their classifica- 
tion of natural objects? Why does such a classification seem un- 
fruitful to the modern physicist? What basis of classification does 
he employ?

day. 
. In how far was the caloric theory of heat a scientific explanation?

every type of event in terms of the behaviour of electrons?

understood?

rather than on that of a fluid enable us to understand it better? To o fer NN An Sf

CHAPTER VII 
EVOLUTION AS A PRINCIPLE OF EXPLANATION 
Section 1. The Variety of Living Things 
One does not have to look closely in order to see that 
earthworms, lobsters, spiders, clams, sharks, frogs and 
monkeys all differ more or less widely from each other. 
Buried in the earth, there are found the remains of 
strange plants and animals, unlike any in existence. 
Thousands upon thousands of species have been mi- 
nutely described and distinguished by the botanist and 
zodlogist. In what manner have these extinct and liy- 
ing forms come into being? This question is to be dis- 
tinguished from that raised in a previous chapter, re- 
garding spontaneous generation. We are not now con- 
cerned with the processes by which the individuals of 
various species are generated ; nor shall we inquire about 
the ultimate origin of life. What we shall consider is 
the nature of the relationship between the great variety 
of living things. 
Two general types of answer have been given to this 
problem: (1) The forms of life which now or ever have 
existed have been introduced by separate, distinct, and 
unconnected creative acts; each species is fixed and ge- 
netically unrelated (special creation). (2) All forms of 
life have descended from a common ancestry; species 
merge one into another, often by almost indistinguish- 
able differences (evolution). 
As historical accounts of the organic realm, the two 
answers have been, and are, in competition. After

formulating them in more detail, therefore, we shall pro- 
ceed to test them in accordance with the criteria of a 
good hypothesis. During this analysis, we shall have 
occasion to refer, in a brief way, to most of the methodo- 
logical principles thus far examined, as ee trace a great 
inquiry from its beginning in a puzzling situation to 
its culmination in an hypothesis Se ere verified 
from many different fields. 
Section 2. Special Creation: A Fixed World 
On the analogy of the jeweler making a watch, or the 
potter making a vessel of clay, this view asserts that the 
various kinds of living things were manufactured, pro- 
duced, fashioned, by some great Artificer whose attri- 
butes are essentially human. Appearing very early 
in the history of the race, the eon ae was carried 
down through oral tradition, popular mythology, and 
general literature. Numerous expressions of it might 
be cited, from ancient Babylonian narratives to the 
pronouncements of present-day literal interpreters of 
Genesis. But as a more familiar presentation, we may 
select a number of verses from the seventh book of 
Paradise Lost. : 
It is the beginning of the fifth day of Creation: 
“And God said, Let the waters generate 
Reptile with spawn abundant, living soul: 
And let fowl fly above the earth, with wings 
Display’d on the open firmament of heav’n. 
And God created the great whales, and each 
Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously 
The waters generated by their kinds, 
And every bird of wing after his kind; 
“The sixth, and of creation last, arose” With ev’ning harps and matin; when God said, 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  
EVOLUTION AS EXPLANATION 155 
Let the earth bring forth soul living in her kind, 
Cattle, and creeping things, and beast of the earth 
Each in their kind. The earth obey’d, and straight 
Op’ning her fertile womb, teem’d at a birth 
Innumerous living creatures, perfect forms, 
Limb’d and full grown. 
“There wanted yet the master-work, the end 
Of all yet done; a creature, who, not prone 
And brute as other creatures, but indued 
With sanctity of reason, might erect 
His stature, and upright with front serene 
Govern the rest, self-knowing; 
“Tet us make now man in our image, man 
In our similitude, and let them rule 
Over the fish and fowl of sea and air, 
Beast of the field, and over all the earth, 
And every creeping thing that creeps the ground. 
This said, He form’d thee, Adam, thee, O man, 
Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breathed 
The breath of life: in his own image he 
Created thee, in the image of God 
Express, and thou becam’st a living soul.” 
This modern retelling of very ancient stories has well 
been called ‘‘the Miltonic hypothesis,” for in its funda- 
mental characteristics it was the prevailing explanation 
of natural science until sixty years ago. Linnzus (1707- 
78), for example, the leading botanist of his time, ac- 
cepted, without question or qualification, the traditional 
notion of species, as specially created and unchangeable. 
To this effect he wrote: “‘ Reason teaches that, at the be- 
ginning of things, a pair of each particular species was 
created.” And again: ‘‘We reckon as many species as 
the Infinite Being created in the beginning.” Originally 
they all appeared at a single spot, resembling the Gar- 
den of Eden, and from there spread about the earth. “I 
believe that I am not straying far from the truth if I
-P-A-G-E-164
  156 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
affirm that in the infancy of the world all the mainland 
was submerged and covered by an enormous ocean, save 
one single island in this immeasurable sea, on which all 
animals dwelt and plants grew luxuriously.” ? 
In this connection it would be possible to examine the 
more or less similar opinions of other distinguished sci- 
entists such as Cuvier, Agassiz, and Richard Owen, but 
our historical interest in this question is only inciden- 
tal. Let a summary paragraph from A. D. White suf- 
fice. After surveying widely the growth of the special 
creation hypothesis, he writes: 
Thus down to a period almost within living memory, it was 
held virtually “always, everywhere, and by all,” that the uni- 
verse as we now see it was created literally and directly by 
the voice or hands of the Almighty, or by both — out of noth- 
ing — in an instant or in six days, or in both — about four 
thousand years before the Christian era — and-for the con- 
venience of the dwellers upon earth, which was at the basis 
and the foundation of the whole structure.” 
THE ARGUMENT FOR SPECIAL CREATION 
The special creation theory, accepted for many centu- 
ries on the basis of an analogy to the making of things 
by men (see section 5) came to be supported in later 
years by a number of observations which at the time 
represented the best opinion of eminent scientists. Pale- 
ontology and geology both seemed to substantiate it. 
For an extended period there were controversies as to 
the nature of those peculiar figures that were found im- 
bedded in the rock strata at so many different levels. 
They were explained by a great variety of conflicting 
opinions: (a) as mineral concretions, or chance forma- 
1 Quoted by O. Schmidt: The Doctrine of Descent and Darwinism. 
2 A History of the Warfare of Science and Theology.
-P-A-G-E-165
EVOLUTION AS EXPLANATION 157 
tions of mineral matter; (b) as models employed by the 
Creator; (c) as divine mysteries; (d) as products of the 
germs of animals and plants which had lost their way. 
In the eighteenth century, however, paleontology be- 
came an important science, and we arrive at Lamarck’s 
modern accepted definition of fossils as ‘‘the still recog- 
nizable remains of organic bodies.” With this convic- 
tion, the scientist now proceeded to a more detailed ex- 
amination of the fossil record, and soon discovered the 
remains of many extinct plants and animals. He found, 
further, that there was often no suggestion of relation- 
ship between the various levels of fossils, that gradual 
gradations are not present —in short, that there are 
wide gaps in the fossil series which would seem to contra- 
dict any idea of common ancestry and slow evolution. 
These observations, which apparently confirm the doc- 
trine of special creation, were the main source of the pre- 
vailing assumption in the allied field of geology, while 
they in their turn were supported by it. 
Combining the above conclusion regarding fossil de- 
posits with a belief in the special creation of fixed species 
and the second important belief that the earth is less 
than six thousand years old, and we are almost com- 
pelled to draw a particular inference regarding the ori- 
gin of fossils. The inference is that the past history of 
the earth was marked by a series of tremendous catas- 
trophes unlike any now observable as a result of which 
all living organisms were destroyed. After each one of 
these catastrophes, there was no life in the world until 
the Creator had introduced a new generation of plants 
and animals. Although the examination of the succes- 
sive layers of fossils might reveal an ascending order 
pointing toward the human race, we could only conclude  
-P-A-G-E-166
  158 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
that this order displayed a series of separate creative 
acts, based, no doubt, on some plan culminating in man, 
but furnished no evidence of genetic relationships. Ac- 
cording to this view, then, the present inhabitants of the 
globe are the lineal descendants of the last creation. 
From these views of a broken series of fossils and a 
short and catastrophic geological history the inference 
was drawn that special creation was the only hypothe- 
sis meeting all conditions. It was an inference only, 
since no one had ever witnessed the creation of a species. 
The evidence was consequently indirect. 
In examining the evidence we should ask: Does the 
inference supporting the hypothesis rest on facts cor- 
rectly presented? Let us examine critically the beliefs 
regarding fossil groups, and the short space of the 
earth’s history. 
It was maintained that the fossil record was broken 
because a number of past cataclysms brought about the 
extinction of all life, thereby making necessary innumer- 
able new acts of special creation. When this view was 
most popular at the opening of the nineteenth century 
the science of paleontology was at its infancy. But in 
the interim many gaps in the record have been filled 
and various series have been made more or less complete, 
as thousands upon thousands of specimens have been 
collected and arranged. As early as 1853, Lyell in- 
sisted that ‘There are no signs of an abrupt termination 
of one fauna and flora, and the starting into life of new 
and wholly distinct forms.” 
When there are still gaps in our fossil record there are 
reasons of seeming adequacy to explain them. ‘The 
imperfection of the geological record”’ is not difficult to 
understand. Climatic cycles of thousands of years bring
-P-A-G-E-167
  
EVOLUTION AS EXPLANATION 159 
about extensive migrations of animals. Driven by the 
changes from its original habitat, a particular species 
may return at the end of a very long period. In the in- 
terim the remains of that species would not become en- 
tombed in the strata then forming. The locations of 
fossil deposits would be altered by the redistribution of 
currents and upheavals or subsidences of shores or sea- 
bottoms., An ocean floor raised to the level of a conti- 
nent would soon accumulate fossils wholly different from 
the deeply underlying strata. Vast quantities of fossil 
remains must have been destroyed by the intense heat 
in the interior of the earth. But simpler than such geo- 
logical detail is the fact that many frail organisms not 
composed of some firm substance such as shell or bone 
could not possibly be preserved. 
The gaps in the fossil series seem susceptible of an ex- 
planation other than that of cataclysm, and separate 
fixed species; and, as these gaps are constantly being 
filled, the fact of their existence becomes less significant 
and the thesis of evolution, the rival of special creation, 
seems better substantiated. 
The short duration of the earth’s history, a second 
supposed fact, began under expert geologic investigation 
to expand itself until the period since life began grew 
from a few thousand to hundreds of thousands or mil- 
lions of years — a period of time so vast as to be quite 
outside the thought of those who had conceived the 
first account of the origin of living things and had 
thought in terms of time-spans easily within man’s 
imagination. 
The catastrophic theory had, moreover, included a be- 
lief in the operation of forces of which we know nothing. 
These had brought about the great periods of destruc-  
-P-A-G-E-168
  * 160 REFLECTIVE THINKING © 
tion. In its place a new theory gradually gained fol- 
lowers — the theory of uniformitarianism; that is, the 
theory which holds that all through the period of the 
formation of the earth the same uniform forces with 
which we are acquainted have been at work. Whenever 
possible, the scientist prefers to entertain an hypothesis 
that is susceptible of verification by further investiga- 
tion. The catastrophic geology presented a series of in- 
comprehensible revolutions in the past; the uniformita- 
rian explanation made it possible to observe and test in 
the present those forces to which the past changes 
were attributed. The catastrophic theory, furthermore, 
proved to be an unnecessary assumption in violation of 
the Law of Parsimony. 
In criticism of an hypothesis, in addition to asking con- 
cerning the facts from which it is an inference, we ask, 
Does it bring simplicity into our world view? In the 
theory of special creation there is no tendency to derive 
the simple from the complex; if anything, the problem 
becomes more complicated. We are compelled to think 
of countless species coming into existence, independ- 
ently of one another. On estimating the living and 
extinct species of plants and animals as approximately 
ten million, we are compelled by this view to think of 
ten million acts of special creation. 
The theory of special creation seems, furthermore, 
quite unable to throw light on other fields, while its rival, 
the theory of evolution, does assist in the understanding 
of the facts of comparative anatomy, embryology, pa- 
leontology and geographical distribution. 
In a good suggestion we expect to find implications. 
We say, If this is so, then this, too, will likely be associ- 
ated and may be understood. Special creation carries
-P-A-G-E-169
EVOLUTION AS EXPLANATION 161 
with it no such range of implication; evolution, as we 
shall see in Section 4, is notably fruitful in this regard. 
Section 8. The Problem of Darwin 
“Reason teaches that, at the beginning of things, a 
pair of each particular species was created.”’ Thus defi- 
nitely did Linnzeus, the lawgiver of Natural History in 
the eighteenth century, answer the question regarding 
the variety of living things. It seemed to him as if the 
world of plants and animals had been ready-made for a 
clear-cut, precise system of classification (‘‘Linnzan” 
classification, as we say). As each species was created 
separate and immutable, one could not possibly be trans- 
formed into another. But at the very time that these 
principles were most dominant, the advance of science in 
various directions was leading to another point of view. 
The earliest, important steps were made in geology. 
While the catastrophic geology was still universally ac- 
cepted, a Scotchman, James Hutton (1726-93), who had 
been studying the formations of his native country for 
many years, reached the conclusion that the mysterious 
causes called in by the ‘‘catastrophists” were superflu- 
ous and fictitious. Affirming that the present is the key to 
the past, he wrote an extensive work illustrating this the- 
sis. Just as the crust of the earth is being changed to- 
day by the action of rain, rivers and tides, chemical de- 
composition and internal disturbances, so continents 
have always been altered and the most ancient strata 
built up. This is the principle of uniformitarianism (cf. 
von Zittel, p. 72) which was elaborated by Lyell and in its 
essential character became the keynote of modern geo- 
logical investigation. The following quotation from 
Playfair was inscribed on the opening page of Lyell’s 
   
-P-A-G-E-170
  162 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
great book: ‘Amid all the revolutions of the globe, the 
economy of nature has been uniform and her laws are 
the only thing which have resisted the general move- 
ment. The rivers and the rocks, the seas and the conti- 
nents have been changed in all their parts; but the laws 
which direct those changes, and the rules to which they 
are subject, have remained invariably the same.’ Dar- 
win once wrote that Lyell’s Principles of Geology “ al- 
tered the whole tone of one’s mind.” And it has often 
been said that the doctrine of organic evolution is sim- 
ply the application of uniformitarianism to the prob- 
lems of biology. 
Let us try to understand what is meant by that last 
statement. The existence of groups of animals having 
certain peculiar qualities was always more or less evi- 
dent, until finally the opinion grew up that some of these 
groups, carefully defined as ‘‘species,’”’ were definitely 
immutable. The criterion of fertility was considered 
absolute, and since they could not have descended from 
one another, they must have been created separately. 
But, on the other hand, there were a great many obscure 
facts which were not illumined by such explanations, 
and which would at once generate questions in the cu- 
rious mind, especially in such a mind as that of Charles 
Darwin. For example, careful observation and classifi- 
cation of fossil remains would reveal the fact that there 
were gradations in the fossil series, and that those higher 
in the series resembled contemporary beings more 
closely than those lower down. Why do animals in a 
particular region always appear to be related to those in 
the next region, so that the order of replacement is grad- 
ual? “Jt was evident,” wrote Darwin in his Autobiogra- 
phy, ‘that such facts as these, as well as many others, could  
-P-A-G-E-171
  
EVOLUTION AS EXPLANATION 163 
only be explained on the supposition that species gradually 
become modified.” 
But now we are faced by the most difficult problem of 
all. Assuming for the moment that the thousands of ex- 
isting species all have a common ancestry, what could 
_be the explanation of such an inconceivably complex 
development? Why should there have been such an 
evolution? Until the ‘““how” of the process had been 
discovered, it would be almost impossible to convince 
people of the process itself. Some solutions had been 
offered, but none seemed adequate. “That which we 
were all looking for,”’ wrote Huxley concerning the in- 
vestigators who were interested in the question before 
Darwin published The Origin of Species in 1859, ‘was an 
hypothesis respecting the origin of known organic forms, 
which assumed the operation of no causes but such as 
could be proved to be actually at work.” 
Unless such causes were forthcoming, special creation 
seemed to be the alternative; and the purposive or teleo- 
logical character of each living thing became the only 
explanation which men might know for its existence. 
Each organism exists for some end. Insects were made 
to fertilize flowers, while cats exist to catch mice. It is 
the function of horses to serve men. In the same way 
every organ was made for a purpose — the eye to see, 
the ear to hear, the hand to grasp, and soon. For one 
who accepts this point of view, every fact of adaptation in 
nature, from the most immense to the most delicate, ap- 
pears to be clearly explained. This is but a brief state- 
ment of the well-known argument from design which 
was elaborately worked out in Paley’s famous work on 
Natural Theology. 
The theory of special creation might, to be sure, be
-P-A-G-E-172
  164 REFLECTIVE THINKING * 
held by those who read no purpose into the creation of 
the myriad forms, but the theory is usually associated 
with the belief that the reason why each thing exists is 
because it is destined to serve some end. This type of 
explanation gives great satisfaction, since, if it can be 
held without contradiction, it serves, better than any 
other, to answer the question, Why? The discovery of 
a final or ultimate cause sets the mind at rest, while 
proximate or efficient causes set one wondering as to 
their origin. 
Darwin was not interested, however, in the discovery 
of a final cause, though nothing in his system or in the 
belief in evolution precludes the belief that, back of all 
the process which has brought the world to its present 
state, there exists one all-inclusive purpose. The Dar- 
winian explanation of the presence of the forms which 
have existed or now live upon the earth had to do, not 
with the purpose, but with the mechanism, of evolution. 
His theory here, that of natural selection, was not his 
main, evolutionary theory, but only an explanatory ele- 
ment within it. He had perceived the origin of many of 
our domesticated plants and animals — the result of de- 
liberate planning on the part of breeders and horticul- 
turists. Here were countless examples of modification 
going on right before his eyes. But this was man-ar- 
ranged, artificial selection; is there some such selection 
taking place in nature at large? If so, what are the agen- 
cies bringing this about? Now, Darwin had read Paley, 
but he also read Malthus on The Principle of Population. 
With his original belief in special creation shaken by 
such questions as we have already referred to, he began 
to brood over the assertion of Malthus, that the food 
supply increases arithmetically, whereas animals in-
-P-A-G-E-173
  EVOLUTION AS EXPLANATION 165 
crease in geometrical proportion. If this is true, a con- 
stant struggle for existence will go on in the living world, 
and those creatures which are able to secure food and ad- 
just themselves to their environment generally will sur- 
vive, while the others will perish — the process known 
as ‘‘Natural Selection,” or ‘‘Survival of the Fittest,’ 
“fittest”? simply meaning capacity for adaptation, and 
not necessarily largest or muscularly strongest. Since 
offspring always tend to vary from the parental line 
(taking variation as a fact given) “favorable varia- 
tions would tend to be preserved, and unfavorable ones 
to be destroyed. The result of this would be the for- 
mation of a new species. Here then I had at last got 
a theory by which to work.” ! These sentences mark 
the beginning of the triumph of the evolution idea. As 
man produced the types of domestic animals by artifi- 
cial selection, the struggle for existence has produced 
changes in the organic forms, in nature at large. It was 
no longer necessary to invoke supernatural interference 
in order to understand such changes. It was no longer 
necessary to introduce a complete teleology in nature 
in order to explain nice adaptations. 
In this chapter we are concerned primarily with the 
general theory of evolution, and not with the factors, or 
mechanism in nature, which brought about the evolu- 
tion. It is entirely possible to be convinced of the fact, 
which is one problem, without having certain knowledge 
of the factors, which form another problem. But in or- 
der to come to a proper understanding of Darwin, it was 
necessary to dwell in some detail on the causal mechan- 
ism of natural selection just described, which led rapidly 
to the general acceptance of a belief that was as old as 
1 Darwin’s Autobiography.
-P-A-G-E-174
  166 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
ancient philosophy. Many thinkers before Darwin had 
contended for evolution, and had offered evidence in 
support of their contention, so that his particular, 
unique contribution was the explanatory hypothesis of 
the mechanism of natural selection, or survival of the 
fittest. It is true that natural selection is by no means 
adequate to explain all of the complicated features of 
evolution, nor did Darwin ever argue that it was the ex- 
clusive cause. Such factors as the direct influence of 
environment and the effect of use and disuse of organs 
have not yet been sufficiently investigated. But what- 
ever further conclusions are drawn, it seems certain that 
natural selection will always be regarded as one of the 
important factors. 
From a period very early in his investigation, the 
work of Darwin became largely deductive — the prob- 
lem of fitting into his hypothesis the concrete facts 
which came under his observation, with the result that 
the facts which might have led to the formulation of the 
hypotheses became evidences for their validity. What, 
then, are the implications of the suggestion that all liv- 
ing forms have a common ancestry? If this hypothesis 
is sound, we should be able to find many indications of 
interconnections between the various so-called ‘‘spe- 
cies.” We should also behold interconnection between 
fossils. In the bodies of very different animals, there 
should appear telltale marks of their common origin. 
From various fields Darwin collected quantities of evi- 
dence which confirmed his hypothesis, and since his day 
there have been opened new fields of investigation which 
are only illuminated when we interpret them in terms of 
evolution. (The several kinds of evidence will be con- 
sidered in the following section.)

  EVOLUTION AS EXPLANATION 167 
At this point let us summarize briefly the method of 
Darwin. (a) Starting with the traditional belief in spe- 
cial creation and design in nature, he came upon such 
facts as the geographical distribution of animals and the 
peculiar relations of fossils. He was impressed further 
by the way in which breeders produced new varieties by 
deliberate selection. (6) Such observations seemed to 
imply modification of species, or diversified develop- 
ment from the same progenitors — the evolutionary hy~ 
pothesis. But an explanation of this development was 
lacking, and he found it in the further hypothesis of nat- 
ural selection, or survival of the fittest. (c) Finally, he 
discovered that the laborious examination of all manner 
of facts verified the evolution hypothesis; or, in other 
words, that from it the specific phenomena of animal 
and plant life were deducible. 
Section 4. Evolution: A Growing World 
Organic evolution means that the present is the child of the 
past and the parent of the future. It is not a power or a prin- 
ciple; it is a process — a process of becoming. It means that 
the present-day animals and plants and all the subtle inter- 
relations between them have arisen in a natural knowable 
way from a preceding state of affairs on the whole some- 
what simpler, and that again from forms and inter-rela- 
tions simpler still, and so on backwards and backwards 
for millions of years till we lose all clues in the thick mist 
that hangs over life’s beginnings.! 
Applicable to every living thing in the history of the 
earth, evolution is one of uthe most sweeping, all-inclu- 
sive generalizations ever conceived. Obviously, it can- 
not be completely established by direct observation or 
experiment, since human experience extends over such a

relatively brief period of time and a small part of the 
globe. But, on the other hand, it is based upon such a 
multitude of observed facts, constantly being added to, 
from so many different sources of investigation, that 
most scientists would probably be inclined to say that 
evolution is now as well founded as Newton’s law of 
gravitation or the Copernican astronomy. It is this 
cumulative character of the evidence for evolution which 
becomes such a convincing confirmation. Not the pres- 
ence of complete proof in any one field, but the fact that 
in every field evidence has been converging, and in none 
has it been incompatible with evolution, is the real argu- 
ment supporting that theory. This fact deserves em- 
phasis as it is a point in the methodology of thought 
which the evolutionary hypothesis illustrates with par- 
ticular clarity. 
In putting the hypothesis to the test, then, we may 
repeat the questions formerly asked concerning special 
creation, without reference to the subordinate problem 
of the mode or mechanism of the evolutionary process. 
Is evolution consistent with the known facts? Does it 
enable us to consider highly complex facts in simpler 
terms? Does it lead to further unknown facts? In this 
instance there will be no need of treating the answers 
separately. We shall see how a vast quantity of appar- 
ently unrelated phenomena are made intelligible by a 
single principle, and for the same reason how a group of 
originally independent sciences becomes unified. In 
this way do various distinct types of evidence point to- 
ward the same conclusion. ©

CUMULATIVE EVIDENCE AND EXPLANATION 
(1) Distribution: Paleontology and Geography. 
The examination of geological strata reveals an as- 
cending order of fossil remains from the exceedingly 
simple to the most complex. Though there are imper- 
fections in the record, there is no indication of com- 
pletely new beginnings. The latest fossils resemble 
most closely existent organisms. From the observation 
of such order we infer genetic continuity. On exhibi- 
tion in our various museums are concrete examples of 
genealogical series. Of these the horse pedigree is per- 
haps the most famous. Through nearly thirty stages, 
covering a period of approximately two million years, 
the modern horse is traced from a small animal of about 
the size of the fox, possessing several toes. Moreover, 
there have been predicted, and later found, intermediate 
fossil forms connecting large and now distinct groups, 
such as the archeopteryx and the pterodactyl, a flying 
reptile. This great accumulation of facts only becomes 
intelligible under the evolution hypothesis, so that Hux- 
Jey was led to remark that paleontologists would have 
had to invent it if it had not already been put forward. 
And according to von Zittel, paleontology had a new 
beginning with the publication of The Origin of Species. 
It will often appear that there is not the slightest rela- 
tion between the animals of widely separated sections of 
a continent. But investigation of the intervening re- 
gions will show animals gradually varying between the 
two extremes. Interpreting these facts in terms of evo- 
lution, we conclude that they have all originated from 
a common center, being gradually modified as they were 
adapted to a new environment.

(2) Comparative Anatomy: Classification, Homology, 
Vestiges. 
It is possible to draw up a “‘tree of life’? which will 
point to the general unity of the entire animal world. 
Group merges into group in the most significant man- 
ner. The natural connections between some of the 
larger classes are continually being discovered. In a 
broad way, we can trace a line of descent from the one- 
celled amceba to the highest vertebrates. The possi- 
bility of zodlogical classification would be a profound 
mystery without the development principle. 
Homologous structures, according to the comparative 
anatomist, are those which have a close resemblance 
both in architecture and in manner of development. 
For example, ‘‘the fore leg of a lizard, the wing of a 
bird and of a bat, the burrowing shovel of a mole, the 
flipper of a whale, the fore leg of a horse, the human arm 
and hand,” are all homologous structures. They seem 
to be modifications of a single primitive type, the con- 
clusion implied by evolution. 
Useless and imperfect organs exist in all animals. 
There are several incomplete bones in the leg of the 
horse, including two functionless digits. Whales have 
vestiges of hind legs, hidden below the surface. In hu- 
man beings there are the muscles of the ears, the vermi- 
form appendix, and occasionally ‘‘hare-lips,” none of 
which are of any value. Such vestigial structures either 
indicate nothing, or they point back to a prolonged evo- 
lution, to animals in which such organs were functional. 
(83) Artificial Breeding: Domestication and Experiment. 
It is difficult to deny the fact of evolution when we see
-P-A-G-E-179
EVOLUTION AS EXPLANATION 171 
concrete examples of the process in the cultivation of 
plants and the domestication of animals. An observer 
of the preévolution period, no matter how acute, would 
naturally see numerous fixed species among the many 
varieties of dogs, horses, pigeons, and so forth. But 
there is sufficient reason for affirming that our dogs are 
domesticated wolves, the many kinds of pigeons have 
descended originally from the wild rock-dove, and our 
beasts of burden have also had their more or less com- 
mon progenitors. 
Data drawn from the comparatively new science of 
genetics have verified further the hypothesis of evolu- 
tion. The experiments often involve dozens or even 
hundreds of generations of a single species. Observa- 
tions made under controlled conditions have revealed 
wide variations from an identical ancestry. Permanent 
and hereditary modifications have been brought about 
by abrupt changes of the environment. ‘‘Thus,” as Pro- 
fessor Scott writes, ‘‘the experimental proof goes to 
show that the species of plants and animals are not fixed 
and immutable entities, but are capable of extensive 
modification even in the short time which is at the com- 
mand of the experimenter.” + 
(4) Embryology and Blood-Tests. 
There are striking resemblances in the embryonic de- 
velopment of animals in the same group. The embryos 
of reptiles, birds, and mammals, up to a certain stage, 
are not immediately distinguishable. At one point, the 
circulatory systems of all mammalians are essentially 
fish-like. In embryos, also, there occur vestigial struc- 
vwures, many of which, however, disappear before birth. 
1 The Theory of Evolution, p. 157. 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  172 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
In a highly abbreviated fashion the embryos seem to - 
repeat the supposed history of the race. As species are 
seen to be related, so the individual, bearing numerous 
traces of his remote ancestry, ceases to appear as a dis- 
tinctly new, sharply defined entity. Unbroken conti- 
nuity is the outstanding feature of the organic realm. 
There is a final class of evidence for evolution which 
differs in character from any known to Darwin, namely, 
the more recently discovered blood-tests. It is found 
in many cases that when the red blood corpuscles of a 
dog or a lower monkey are brought into contact with 
the serum or liquid portion of the blood of a human 
being the corpuscles are dissolved; but when the red 
blood corpuscles of a higher anthropoid ape are brought 
into contact with human serum they remain unaffected. 
This condition is paralleled in the case of a horse and 
an ass, a hare and a rabbit, an orang and a gibbon, a 
dog and a wolf. There is a slightly different reaction 
known as the precipitin test which has been performed 
by Professor Nuttall of Cambridge University sixteen 
thousand times with a large variety of blood sera. These 
two types of experiment are further indications of the 
general unity of all animal life and they point out specifi- 
cally the degrees of relationships between the groups of 
animals, including the relationships between man and 
the higher apes. In this way, not only is the evolution 
hypothesis further substantiated, but an entirely new 
field of investigation is illuminated, which, without that 
hypothesis, would be incomprehensible. Add to this 
the multifarious facts of paleontology, geographical 
distribution, comparative anatomy, genetics, and em- 
bryology as integrated by the evolutionary interpre- 
tation, and we may understand somewhat how far-  
-P-A-G-E-181
  EVOLUTION AS EXPLANATION 173 
reaching in its consequences a profound theory may be. 
Literally, evolution has created new sciences while it has 
remade old ones. 
THE EFFECT OF EVOLUTION ON CLASSIFICATION 
But more immediately in connection with our study 
of scientific principles, it is important to note the effect 
of evolution on the former conception of biological clas- 
sification. That conception, as most thoroughly devel- 
oped by Linnzus, was based on the doctrine of special 
creation; the same position was taken by Linnzus’ con- 
temporary, Cuvier, one of the keenest observers in all 
the history of science. According to them, the organic 
world was naturally divided into a certain number of 
sharply defined, unrelated classes. For them, the ap- 
parent connections between some of the classes is only 
ideal, and not genetic. ‘‘Specific features are constant, 
and remain so even in domesticated breeds.” Thus, 
careful definition and accurate classification, which are 
the first stages in scientific investigation, became the 
end and ideal of biological science in the eighteenth cen- 
tury. This was the inevitable consequence of the false 
foundation upon which biology then rested. Not even 
genius, such as that of Linnzeus or Cuvier, could advance 
far without a sound hypothesis, both as a guide for ob- 
servation and as a principle of explanation. ‘‘Nature, 
it has been said, gives no reply to a general inquiry — 
she must be interrogated by questions which already 
contain the answer she is to give; in other words, the ob- 
server can only observe that which he is led by hypothe- 
sis to look for; the experimenter can only obtain the re- 
sult which his experiment is designed to obtain.” !

Logic, pp. 278-82.  
-P-A-G-E-182
  174 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
The doctrine of evolution has exposed the arbitrary 
character of the older classification. We have come to 
realize that there are no sharp lines in nature, that the 
various forms of life have numerous relationships, and 
that ultimately they are all parts of one continuous 
stream. We have come to realize that there are no sep- 
arate groups resulting from special creation. For pre- 
cisely this reason, the word “‘species,” which has been 
used so often in this chapter, has not undergone defini- 
tion; it cannot be strictly defined. There are no fixed, 
immutable species, as formerly imagined. Even the 
chemist has found that his divisions are not absolute, 
discovering that atoms break down to form other ele- 
ments. The distinction often made in logic textbooks 
between ‘‘natural” and ‘‘artificial”’ classification is 
really misleading; all classification is more or less artifi- 
cial, more or less approximate. Such terms as ‘“‘species”’ 
and ‘‘genera”’ are not, as we have noted, descriptive of 
actual divisions in the nature of things; they are only 
convenient, practical instruments, by means of which 
the naturalist organizes his material. And as such, they 
are exceedingly valuable, being the raw material of bio- 
logical generalization. 
Section 5. Some Psychological Factors in Biological 
Belief 
The belief that each living thing existed by an act of 
special creation, and the belief that all creation had a 
purpose, including, ultimately, that of serving man him- 
self, find support in some of the most deeply rooted tend- 
encies of thought. 
Man knows how he himself does things; he knows that 
he makes his tools, his home, his garments. Each new 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
  EVOLUTION AS EXPLANATION 175 
object which aids him in his life is directly or indirectly 
the work of his hands. With this knowledge strong 
within him, what could be more natural than that he 
should think of all living things, and the earth itself as 
the work of some great artificer, man-like, but enor- 
mously more wise and powerful? This tendency of man 
to think of things in terms of himself is called ‘‘anthro- 
pomorphism,” man-form-ism. It is hard, furthermore, 
to understand not merely how things came to be, but 
also how they came to fit together. When things suit 
man’s convenience, he himself has usually brought them 
together in accordance with some plan. Many things 
in the world man is acquainted with, fit together with 
amazing serviceability. This fact cannot escape even a 
casual observer. What more natural, then, than that 
man, even in explaining this world, should think that 
all created things play a part in some great precon- 
ceived plans, and that each thing serves some pur- 
pose? Spinoza (1632-77) gave a classic expression to 
this idea in his Ethics: + 
Men do all things for an end, namely, for that which is use- 
ful to them, and which they seek. Thus it comes to pass that 
they only look for a knowledge of the final causes of events, 
and when these are learned they are content, as having no 
cause for further doubt. If they cannot learn such causes from 
external sources, they are compelled to turn to consider- 
ing themselves, and reflecting what end would have induced 
them personally to bring about the given event, and thus they 
necessarily judge other natures by their own. Further, as 
they find in themselves, and outside of themselves, many 
means which assist them not a little in their search for what is 
useful, for instance, eyes for seeing, teeth for chewing, herbs 
and animals for yielding food, the sun for giving light, the sea 
1 Appendix, Book 1.
-P-A-G-E-184
  176 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
for breeding fish, etc., they come to look on the whole of na- 
ture as a means for obtaining such conveniences. Now, as 
they are aware that they found these conveniences and did 
not make them, they think they have cause for believing that 
some other being has made them for their use. As they look 
upon things as means, they cannot believe them to be self- 
created; but judging from the means which they are accus- 
tomed to prepare for themselves, they are bound to believe in 
some ruler or rulers of the universe endowed with human free- 
dom, who have arranged and adapted everything for human use.” 2 
Thus, as Spinoza says, man is apt to see a purpose in 
the order of creation which serves himself as its pinnacle. 
Pride is a great motivator of belief. For this reason 
each creature might well be thought of as specially 
placed on earth for man’s use. This tendency is called 
“anthropocentrism” — man’s tendency to orient all 
things from himself as the center. This psychological 
tendency is one of the reasons for the enduring appeal of 
special creation and for the opposition to evolution. 
The believer in evolution, who may be, to be sure, 
convinced on other grounds, sometimes finds in his de- 
sire to believe the doctrine an additional motive for its 
acceptance. Perhaps the best example of this psycholog- 
ical rather than logical element in belief is to be found in 
those persons or groups who pursue in their conduct the 
theory of the survival of the fittest, carried over into 
the ethical field of conscious and responsible human re- 
lations, with all the crudeness of its operation in the non- 
conscious and non-evaluating realm of nature. Valid 
standards for human ethics are not discoverable in the 
non-human world. The uncritical belief that the sur- 
vival of the fittest is everywhere nature’s law seems to 
1Cf. Hume, The Natural History of Religion.
-P-A-G-E-185
EVOLUTION AS EXPLANATION 177 
such persons justification for their conduct; and justifi- 
cation is a constant human need.* 
In the scales for weighing belief neither man’s tend- 
ency to such self-justification, nor his habit of viewing 
things in terms of likeness to himself, nor his fondness 
for making all things serve him, should weigh heavily — 
they may be causes, but scarcely reasons, for belief. 
Evidence rather than desire is a reliable guide. Into 
figures there can creep few biases. Even there, how- 
ever, bias may appear in interpretation. 
Section 6. Misconceptions of Evolution 
However carefully the principle of evolution may 
have been formulated, misinterpretations were bound 
to follow as it became involved in general application. 
Among scientists themselves the implications of an hy- 
pothesis are frequently carried beyond their logically 
justifiable bounds. But when an idea derives its name 
from the common speech and makes a serious appeal to 
the popular mind, the danger of perversion is indefi- 
nitely greater. This is especially true of the doctrine of 
evolution. A large part of our thinking, often quite un- 
consciously, is “evolutionary.” It has become the gen- 
eral tendency to study all phenomena in terms of origin 
and growth. The development of religious beliefs, po- 
litical institutions, and moral customs is traced along 
with the genealogies of plants and animals. As might 
be expected, therefore, the strictly scientific notion of 
evolution has been variously misunderstood, and in the 
following sections we shall discuss two of the more com- 
mon misconceptions.

Ethics. 
   
-P-A-G-E-186
  
  178 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
EVOLUTION NOT SELF-EXPLANATORY 
How exceedingly valuable evolution is as a principle 
of explanation, we have already observed in some detail. 
It has indicated relationships between multitudes of 
widely separated phenomena. We realize that ideas and 
objects, animals and institutions, do not soar up in sud- 
den isolated fashion, but, on the contrary, are all parts 
of continuous series. 
An evolutionary explanation is an historical descrip- 
tion of events occurring in time. But an historical de- 
scription is not per se a causal explanation. It is one 
thing to trace antecedents; it is quite a different thing to 
discover reasons for that particular succession. ‘‘There 
is an obvious and striking similarity between the evolu- 
tion of man’s inventions and the evolution of the shells 
of molluscs and of the bones of mammals, yet in neither 
case does a knowledge of the order in which these things 
arose explain them.”’! The fact that there should have 
been any changes at all is a profound, and often an in- 
soluble, problem. This is simply the crucial distinction 
that we have already made between the fact and the 
factors of evolution. Granting this order, why has it 
been as it has been? Why did this occurrence precede 
that? Or, for example, why have our ancestors had cer- 
tain beliefs? 
If we ask why they so believed, it will not profit us to pursue 
antiquity again, unless by so doing we come upon the con- 
temporaneous, experimental origin of that belief. For it is 
evident that if the belief had an origin, there was a time an- 
terior when it did not exist, and its origin cannot, therefore, 
be explained solely in terms of that anterior time. Its origin 
points, not to continuity, but to action. It indicates, not that 
1T. H. Morgan, Theory of Evolution, p. 4.
-P-A-G-E-187
EVOLUTION AS EXPLANATION 179 
the originators of the belief had ancestors, but that, in view of 
their contemporaneous circumstances, they acted in a certain 
way. To explain the origin of anything, therefore, we cannot 
trust to the continuity of history alone. The continuity may 
carry us back to the beginnings of beliefs and institutions 
which have persisted and been transmitted from age to age; it 
may reveal to us experimental factors which have shaped be- 
liefs and institutions, but which have long since been forgot- 
ten; but it can never, of itself, reveal the experimental origin 
of any belief or institution. That is, in principle, the limita- 
tion by which the explanatory value of historical continuity 
is restricted. To understand origins we must appeal to the 
contemporaneous experience of their own age, or to experi- 
mental science.! 
Certainly evolution is a valid kind of explanation, but 
it is by no means the only kind. ‘To explain anything 
at all, it is necessary to keep in mind the questions to 
which the proposed explanation is relevant.” In the 
previous chapter we discovered that a variety of expla- 
nations can be given for the same facts, depending on 
the specific questions that have been asked. A mechani- 
cal explanation, for example, is not incompatible with an 
explanation in terms of purpose. So we may consider 
a particular lyric as the consequence of the poet’s un- 
usual diet or his unusual lady, and neither explana- 
tion will exclude the other. The beauty of the lyric 
itself, as much as the beauty of a rose sprung from a 
refuse heap, is quite independent of its origin. In the 
same way, the truth of Schopenhauer’s philosophy, or 
of Nietzsche’s, or of Carlyle’s, may be examined without 
reference to mental pathology. Though science origi- 
nated in myth, it does not follow that contemporary 
science is mythical. If religion developed from ghost- 
1 Woodbridge, The Purpose of History, p. 69. 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  180 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
worship, modern religion is not therefore nothing but a 
modification of belief in ghosts. The understanding of 
most phenomena is reached better by a contemplation 
of the latter stages than of the earlier, the contempla- 
tion of the oak rather than the acorn, the bird rather 
than the egg, the finished book rather than the fragmen- 
tary outline. The conduct of conscious beings can be 
interpreted more intelligently by considerations of pur- 
pose than of physiology. The knowledge of man’s hum- 
ble origin and of his bloody history is no justification 
of bellicose ideals and continuous wars among civilized 
peoples. 
EVOLUTION NOT NECESSARILY PROGRESSIVE 
In the briefest phrase possible, evolution means de- 
scent, with modifications which are usually adaptive. 
It is thus purely a scientific, descriptive term, with no 
moral or esthetic implications. It has no necessary 
connection with progress. But that some such identi- 
fication would be made is explained by the theory that 
the idea of evolution itself evolved from the idea of prog- 
ress as ‘‘a gift from the philosophy of human nature to 
the philosophy of all nature.” ! Progress was the dom- 
inant theme of revolutionary enthusiasm early in the 
last century, and somewhat later, evolution became the 
focus of discussion. In the Synthetic Philosophy of Her- 
bert Spencer and the poetry of Tennyson the two ideas 
are hopelessly mingled. 
On the whole, we have been right in thinking of evolu- 
tion as a movement from the relatively simple to the rel- 
atively complex. This has involved finer adaptations, 
1Cf. Benn, History of English Rationalism in the Nineteenth Cen- 
tury, vol. v, p. 13.
-P-A-G-E-189
  EVOLUTION AS EXPLANATION 181 
increased stability, and advance in intelligence. The 
human race is the latest stage of a prolonged and compli- 
cated process. But there may be, and indeed there is, 
in nature, evolution ‘‘downward’’ — that is, movement 
from the more complex to the less complex — in a most 
astonishing degree. As Professor Lankester has pointed 
out, there are three possibilities for any form of life: (1) 
balance, in which it maintains more or less its status quo, 
an even equilibrium; (2) elaboration, in which it becomes 
more complex in structure; (3) degeneration, in which the 
complexity of its structure diminishes and it becomes 
adapted to more simple conditions of life. Parasitism is 
a manner of adaptation in which one organism lives off 
another, inhabiting the food-canal, the blood-stream, or 
the tissues. It has been estimated that more than half 
the animal kingdom is parasitic. 
With regard to ourselves, the white races of Europe, the 
possibility of Degeneration seems worth some consideration. 
In accordance with a tacit assumption of universal progress 
— an unreasoning optimism — we are accustomed to regard 
ourselves as necessarily progressing, as necessarily having ar- 
rived at a higher and more elaborated condition than that 
which our ancestors reached, and as destined to progress still 
further. On the other hand, it is well to remember that we 
are still subject to the general laws of Evolution, and are 
as likely to degenerate as to progress. As compared with 
the immediate forefathers of our civilization — the ancient 
Greeks — we do not appear to have improved as far as our 
bodily structure is concerned, nor assuredly so far as some of 
our mental capacities are concerned. Our powers of per- 
ceiving and expressing beauty of form have certainly not in- 
creased since the days of the Parthenon and Aphrodite of 
Melos. In matters of the reason, the development of the in- 
tellect, we may seriously inquire how the case stands. Does 
the reason of the average man of civilized Europe stand out 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  182 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
clearly as an evidence of progress when compared with that of 
men of bygone ages? In such respects we have at least reason 
to fear that we may degenerate.! 
Section 7. Summary 
_ The foregoing comparison of the special creation and 
evolutionary hypotheses illustrates once more on a large 
scale all the methodological principles described in pre- 
vious chapters, makes the meaning of those principles 
clearer, and adds new poiuts to our account of reflection 
in the sciences. In comparing the Ptolemaic and Co- 
pernican astronomies the criteria of a good scientific hy- 
pothesis were found to be: (1) ability to explain all the 
facts, (2) simplicity, and (8) usefulness in prediction 
and further discovery. The analysis of the molecular 
theory in physics showed us what was meant by ex- 
planation. 
In one sense the special creation theory is able to ex- 
plain all the facts better than any evolutionary theory. 
For no description yet offered of the mechanism of evolu- 
tion is quite consistent with all the evidence, whereas the 
Creator is by a single act of faith endowed with the 
power to produce anything He likes. But this greater 
inclusiveness of the special creation theory is procured 
by giving almost no account of the mechanism of crea- 
tion, so that we cannot be said to understand it at all, 
much less to predict what further species it may be ex- 
pected to produce. In the full sense of the word ‘‘ex- 
planation,” therefore, the special creation theory may 
be said to explain nothing whatever. The only kind of 
explanation it gives is a sense of completed inquiry and 
rest in the contemplation of a supreme power that can

-P-A-G-E-191
  EVOLUTION AS EXPLANATION 183 
do anything. The satisfaction which accompanies the 
final solution of a problem is here reached, but only by 
surrendering the problem, and without real illumination. 
One should observe that simplicity in science must 
never be procured by turning away from facts. Though 
the creation process may seem simpler than the evolu- 
tionary one, the latter has the tremendous scientific ad- 
vantage of involving processes that have all been actu- 
ally observed in nature, while all the elements of the 
former are hypothetical. The special creation theory 
illustrates two tendencies of the human imagination 
which are dangerous to science. One is the tendency to 
speculate rather than to observe; the other is the tend- 
ency of these speculations to take an anthropomorphic 
form, as if all beings were like men. We have at once 
too much and too little imagination for science. Sci- 
entific imagination must be free to conceive unfamiliar 
processes, and at the same time ready to test its concep- 
tions by experience. It must be bold, yet disciplined. 
To illustrate these qualities of scientific imagination, 
and also to show how a broad generalization like evolu- 
tion rests on evidence accumulated from many fields, was 
the special function of this chapter. It may be pointed 
out, in closing, that the question of the ultimate origin of 
the universe was not involved in the problem, and there- 
fore was not discussed.

  CHAPTER VIII 
HOW REFLECTIVE THOUGHT DEALS WITH THE PAST 
AS ILLUSTRATED BY THE CRITICISM OF THE 
PENTATEUCH 
Section 1. Character of Historical Inquiry 
We have seen how scientific inquiry deals with natural 
phenomena; that is, those facts of experience which 
can either be reproduced at will or observed repeatedly 
as they recur. Some scientific methods, however, will 
evidently fail us when we seek to ascertain events in 
the past; for, in the nature of the case, past events do not 
recur and cannot recur. Historical events differ from 
scientific events proper, in that they cannot be proved 
experimentally; for they cannot be repeated. No doubt 
one Indian war may be much like another; but no In- 
dian fighter, General Miles, for example, ever did, or 
ever could, duplicate Custer’s last fatal battle with the 
Sioux. Historical inquiry, therefore, must resort, either 
(1) to the after effects of events gone by — too often 
mere vestiges —or (2) to the testimony of eye- and 
ear-witnesses, all of whom, recent history apart, are 
now dead. Geology, the history of the physical earth, 
is virtually confined to the first resource; human his- 
tory makes use chiefly of the second — the testimony 
of former witnesses. 
Historical inquiry is thus dependent mainly upon 
written testimony, or documents. Hence it is, also, 
largely a literary and critical inquiry; that is, it is con- 
cerned with questions as to the age, correct test, author- 
ship, teachings, and design of its documentary sources,
-P-A-G-E-195
  HISTORICAL INQUIRY 187 
(1) The Lower Criticism. The determination of the 
true text of an ancient manuscript requires such special 
training that this kind of investigation has become a dis- 
tinct branch of historico-critical inquiry. It is known 
as the “lower criticism,” or at times “‘ textual criticism,” 
criticism being the accepted name for careful inquiry into 
the past according to canons already approved in expert- 
ence. It is called “lower,” not because it is inferior, but 
because it is concerned with the evidential foundations 
of the subject-matter. In most cases ancient books are 
now extant in the form of various manuscripts the word- 
ing of which differs not infrequently one from another. 
The original manuscripts were, of course, long since 
worn out orlost. Those of to-day are copies, and copies 
of copies, indeed the last #inks in a long chain of copies. 
All of these were made by hand; and even the best 
copyists are subject to error. Omissions have been 
made; additions, also, sometimes in the form of what 
are called ‘‘glosses.” A ‘‘gloss” is a comment written 
upon the margin of the page by some reader, which a 
later scribe, supposing it to have been omitted, has 
copied into the body of the manuscript. In all such 
cases, which is the correct text? It is for the “‘lower 
critic’”’ to answer. 
(2) The Higher Criticism. All questions as to date, 
authorship, contents, and purpose fall within the field of 
the ‘‘higher critic”; that is, the inquirer concerned with 
the superstructure of record and thought reared by the 
author of the book. In this extensive task the higher 
critic is not without accepted canons of judgment to 
guide him; for historical criticism, learning partly from 
its own experience and partly from that of the courts of 
law, has established certain principles of documentary
-P-A-G-E-196
  188 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
evidence. In practice these methods take the form of 
queries to be applied to each document, and are such 
as the following: 
(a) What is the content of the writing? that is, 
What does the witness actually say? 
(6) Who is the witness? This question is not one of 
purely literary interest; it often has a most important 
bearing upon the witness’s competency. To answer it is 
often much harder than an ordinary reader might sup- 
pose. Ancient writers were not wont to put their names 
upon their manuscripts. When the author’s name is 
present, it has usually been placed there by a later 
hand, probably that of a copyist. But did the copyist 
know who was the author? If not, what were the 
grounds of his opinion on the subject? A further diffi- 
culty arises from the fact that in ancient times the 
name attached to a book as its ostensible author was 
sometimes not that of the writer, but of some man of 
distinction in an age gone by whose putative authorship 
would be likely to give the book prestige and authority. 
(c) Another question concerns the personal qualifica- 
tions of the writer as to character, competency, and op- 
portunity. Was he an eye- or ear-witness, or does his ac- 
count rest upon hearsay? If parts of the Pentateuch 
were written by Ezra (in the fifth century B.c.) it is ob- 
vious that they may not be good evidence as to what 
happened in the time of Moses, over a thousand years 
before. But even eye-witnesses, as every court of jus- 
tice knows full well, differ greatly in their powers of ob- 
servation, and still more in their capacity to report 
events as they actually saw them. For example, it has 
been shown that the three principal eye-witness ac 
counts of so recent an event as the surrender of Napo
-P-A-G-E-197
  HISTORICAL INQUIRY 189 
leon III at Sedan vary in material respects, although one 
of the witnesses was the owner of the house in which the 
capitulation was signed, another a prominent German 
general, and the third the noted war-correspondent, 
Archibald Forbes. 
In particular, it has been found that witnesses have a 
tendency both to perceive and to remember things, first, 
according to their expectations, second, according to 
their emotional bias, and, third, according to their pri- 
vate notions as to what would be the natural or reason- 
able way for things to happen. So criticism inquires, 
also, into the personality of the witness, which means 
not only his veracity, but also his mental tendencies. 
Was he a man of sober frame of mind, or was he imagi- 
native in his thinking? Was he chiefly concerned with 
actual events — the facts — or was his main interest 
in the political or ethical or theological bearings of 
things? 
(3) For most historical inquiries two kinds of evi- 
dence are available, external and internal. 
(a) External evidence consists in such things as refer- 
ences to the writing in question, or quotations from it, 
by contemporary or shortly succeeding writers. In the 
case of most of the Old Testament books this kind of 
evidence is lacking. The books themselves are the only 
survivals of early Hebrew literature, and international 
culture in those days can scarcely be said to have ex- 
isted. 
(b) Internal evidence consists in all those critical indi- 
cations which lie within the writing itself, such as the lan- 
guage used, the literary style, the opinions expressed or 
implied, and the historical and geographical references. 
For instance, when in Isaiah xutv, 28 Yahveh is repre-
-P-A-G-E-198
  190 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
sented as saying of ‘‘Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall 
perform all my pleasure; even saying of Jerusalem, 
Thou shalt be built: and to the temple, Thy foundations 
shall be laid,’’ etc., it is evident that that part of the 
book was not written by Isaiah, who antedated Cyrus 
by a century and ahalf. Nor, indeed, was it written be- 
fore the captivity, for evidently Jerusalem was lying 
waste and needed to be rebuilt. 
As an example of historical inquiry the problem of the 
origin and general structure of the Pentateuch, or first 
five books of the Bible, has been chosen for study, in the 
belief that it is a case which can be followed by any in- 
telligent reader. 
Section 2. The Traditional and Critical Views of the 
Old Testament 
At the beginning of the Christian era, the Jewish lit- 
erature then current consisted chiefly of certain books 
which, because of their religious contents, were regarded 
as sacred and authoritative. They were known as the 
Scriptures, or writings. Later when taken collectively 
ecclesiastical scholars called them the canon, but the 
popular name for them became the Bible. These writ- 
ings were divided by a writer! of the second century B.c. 
— probably not for the first time — into three groups, 
“the law and the prophets and the rest of the books.”’ (1) 
Subsequent usage in the Talmud, New Testament, and 
Josephus shows that by the ‘‘ Law” was meant the Pen- 
tateuch — Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and 
Deuteronomy — all of which were attributed to Moses 
asauthor. (2) By the ‘‘Prophets’’ was meant of course, 
1 The grandson of Jesus, the son of Sirach, who about 139 s.c. trans- 
lated his grandfather’s Proverbs into Greek.
-P-A-G-E-199
  
HISTORICAL INQUIRY 191 
the books of Amos, Hosea, and so forth, called the 
“Later Prophets,” Daniel excepted, and also the more 
important of what we now consider the historical books, 
namely, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings. These 
were known as the ‘‘Earlier Prophets.” (8) The third, 
or miscellaneous, group came to be called the ‘Sacred 
Writings,” though in point of fact it was regarded as less 
sacred than the ‘‘Law” or even than the ‘‘Prophets.” 
These Biblical writings are accepted, not only by or- 
thodox Jews, but by Mohammedans and virtually all 
Christian churches as true and authoritative, as are also 
the main Jewish literary ideas concerning them. For 
example, the Council of Trent, which in 1564 largely 
stereotyped the Roman Catholic creed, pronounced as 
follows: ‘‘The sacred and holy cecumenical and general 
Synod of Trent, lawfully assembled in the Holy Ghost 
.. receives and venerates with an equal affection of piety 
all the books both of the Old and New Testament, see- 
ing that one God is the author of both.... And it has 
thought it meet that a list of the sacred books be in- 
serted in this decree,” etc. At the end of the list the de- 
cree adds, “‘if any one receive not as sacred and ca- 
nonical the said books entire with all their parts .. . let 
him be anathema.” In general the Protestant churches 
have concurred in these statements although the latter 
do not accept the so-called ‘“‘apocrypha”’ as inspired. 
This brief historical sketch reveals two connected, 
but quite distinguishable, things: 
(1) The existence prior to the Christian era of a col- 
lection of books accepted as sacred, the first five of 
which (the “Law” or Pentateuch) current Jewish opin- 
ion assigned to the initial period of Israel’s history 
and attributed to one author, Moses — Israel’s origi-  
-P-A-G-E-200
  
  192° , REFLECTIVE THINKING 
nal legislator, and traditional liberator from Egyptian 
bondage. 
(2) A remarkable consensus of opinion as to the su- 
pernatural character and authority of these books, an 
authority varying in degree usually in direct proportion 
to their reputed age. Thus the Protestant Westminster 
Confession declares concerning them, “All which are 
given by inspiration of God, to be the rule of faith and 
life.” These opinions as to age, authorship, and author- 
ity constitute the traditional view of the Old Testament 
and of the Pentateuch as its oldest and most sacred por- 
tion. 
Over against this age-long and cumulatively but- 
tressed body of opinion the modern critic has dared to 
offer another account of the Hebrew Scriptures, and to 
advocate it as rationally superior. According to him 
the Old Testament is the selected literature of an ancient, 
developing people, the selective criterion (used more or 
less subconsciously) being that of religious and patriotic 
value. 
(1) As in Greece and other seats of early culture, the 
literary beginnings consisted of songs, such as the song 
of Miriam, the song of Moses, and the song of Deborah. 
(Exod. xv, 1-19, 21; Judges v.) Professor Sanday 
characterizes them as ‘‘impassioned utterances of the 
natural man.” They are strong in group loyalty, and 
breathe a lively devotion to Yahveh as the tribal God. 
(2) The next type of writing to appear was that of 
history, or quasi-history, though much legal material 
was included in it. In the main the Pentateuch is a 
synthesized and edited collection of parts of three his- 
torical writings, parts selected by a fourth and later 
hand, a hand which added no little material of its own
-P-A-G-E-201
  
HISTORICAL INQUIRY 193 
and thus became the author of the Pentateuch as a 
whole. Except in the case of Deuteronomy the parts 
selected from older documents do not correspond with 
the traditional divisions of the Pentateuch. 
(a) One of the original sources used is now known as 
the Elohist, owing to the fact that, along with his other 
distinctive characteristics, the author, down to the Mo- 
saic period, uses the name Elohim for the national God. 
His narrative — technically known as E — is annalistic. 
It includes many genealogical lists, and lays weight 
upon orderly development. The author was a citizen 
of the northern kingdom, which means, of course, that 
he wrote after the time of Solomon, and is by no means 
to be identified with Moses. 
(b) Another leading Pentateuchal author is known as 
the Jehovist, or Yahvist, because from the very first he 
calls the divinity by his tribal or covenant name of Yah- 
veh. His contribution is called J (Jehovist). He gives 
another and strikingly different account of the creation. 
He treats the early history from the ethical and theo- 
logical viewpoint of prophetism, and seems to have lived 
in the kingdom of Judah. Manuscripts E and J origi- 
nated apparently between the time of Solomon and the 
eighth century prophets (Hosea, Amos, etc.), and at a 
relatively early date were so combined that in places 
they are not now distinguishable. So they are some- 
times referred to together as J. E. 
(c) The third historical factor is Deuteronomy, which 
made its appearance in the reign of Josiah in the latter 
part of the seventh century, B.c. It contains much 
legal and ecclesiastical material, but is written largely 
from the prophetic point of view. It was perhaps the 
outcome of a compromise between the prophetic and the 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  194 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
priestly parties. Its aim was, on the one side, a stricter 
monotheism and, on the other, a more equitable social 
order. It was apparently a product, and certainly an 
instrument, of the notable prophetic reformation ef- 
fected under King Josiah. Its references to addresses 
made to the people by Moses were literary devices for 
claiming the authority of the great deliverer of old, an 
authority which the author doubtless believed was on 
his side; but there is no reason to think that he had 
more than possibly an oral tradition to justify him. 
The Book of the Covenant (Exod. xx1-xxi) already 
ascribed to Moses may have been a written source 
utilized by the author. 
(d) The fourth and all-inclusive section of the Penta- 
teuch is primarily legal, and especially occupied with 
ceremonial matters. It is known as P, because it ap- 
pears to have been the work of a priest, or of a partisan 
of the priestly ideals and interests. It dates from the 
Jewish restoration in the fifth century B.c. under Nehe- 
miah and Ezra, and Ezra probably was its author. The 
ceremonial law as proclaimed by him was a combination 
of prophetic and priestly factors, factors which had 
formerly been often at variance, but which the tribula- 
tions of deportation and captivity had brought inte 
temporary accord. Religious ritual and rules regulat- 
ing it there had been, of course, from very early times, 
and it had been increasing in amount for generations 
prior to the fall of Jerusalem. These ceremonial pro- 
visions Ezra incorporated into his edition of the Mosaic 
law; but many of his rules appear to have had no stand- 
ing in that law before his time, unless it be in the minds 
of certain priestly zealots. As a completed whole the 
Pentateuch thus arose in one of the later stages of He- 
. brew history and by no means at the outset. 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  HISTORICAL INQUIRY 195 
In this critical view of the Pentateuch the most fun- 
damental contentions appear to be two: (1) In general 
its older parts are not now in their original form, but 
have been expanded or curtailed, cast and recast, in 
later times. (2) The Pentateuch, and indeed most of 
our present Old Testament books, are composite, being 
constituted largely, and through various editing proc- 
esses, of the older writings just referred to. 
The opposition between these two views is evidently 
great. To the conservative believer the critic seems to 
be unreasonable and presumptuous in thus challenging 
(as one such! says) ‘‘convictions which have come down 
unchallenged from the earliest Jewish age until what 
may be called yesterday.” John Stuart Blackie’s re- 
mark about the criticism of the Iliad is cited: ‘‘We who 
stand on the recognized text have the tradition of long 
centuries in our favor. ... Possession in literary, as in 
civil, matters is nine points of the law.’ Indeed, the 
very concessions of the new interpreters favor the charge 
of presumption. ‘The critic,” says Professor Kuenen, 
“has no other Bible than the public. He does not pro- 
fess to have any additional documents, inaccessible to 
the laity, nor does he profess to find anything in his 
Bible that the ordinary reader cannot see.... Yet he 
dares to form a conception of Israel’s religious develop- 
ment totally different from that which, as any one may 
see, is set forth in the Old Testament.” 
Nor is the critic able to appeal to archeology for sup- 
port. The monuments and other material remains of 
ancient times do not contradict the traditional view. 
The opposition between the two views is thus not prop- 
erly one as to the facts, but one as to the right interpre- 
1 John Kennedy, D.D.
-P-A-G-E-204
  196 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
tation of the facts. Opposite ways of thinking are 
involved. This thought opposition will appear more 
clearly if we follow the critic in a few of his reasonings. 
Section 8. Some of the Critical Arguments 
All of these are appeals to internal, not external, evi- 
dence. In the first place, the critic points to the com- 
posite character of the Pentateuch. That the book of Prov- 
erbs is a collection of writings of various authorship 
probably no Biblical student will deny. The first nine 
chapters, attributed by the text to Solomon, and headed 
repeatedly with the words, ‘‘My son,” are plainly differ- 
ent in style from the succeeding thirteen chapters, which 
have a fresh title and do not use that form of address. 
Other parts of the book are attributed to ‘‘the wise,” 
to Agur, to King Lemuel, while the conclusion (an alpha- 
betical acrostic) appears to be anonymous. Much the 
same is true of the book of Psalms. Five distinct hymn- 
books are plainly in evidence, each having a concluding 
doxology, and each made up apparently with no more 
regard for authorship than a modern hymn-book. Evi- 
dently literary compilation was nothing foreign to an- 
cient Hebrew composition. 
In the Pentateuch the composite structure is natu- 
rally not so obvious; but surely few who believe that 
Moses was its author will deny that verses 5 to 12 in the 
34th chapter of Deuteronomy were written by a later 
hand than his. Even with the utmost good-will, one 
can scarcely believe that Moses wrote the account of his 
own death and burial, and then added, ‘‘No man know- 
eth of his sepulchre unto this day.” Such a remark could 
come with propriety only from one who wrote long af- 
terward, with the admission of which truth, be it noted,
-P-A-G-E-205
  HISTORICAL INQUIRY 197 
the higher criticism of the Pentateuch has begun. It 
cannot stop there, however. 
A composite character appears manifestly in the Pen- 
tateuch’s inclusion of the songs of Lamech, of Balaam, 
of Moses, of Miriam, etc. It is almost equally evident 
in the duplicate and variant accounts of certain events. 
The first two chapters of Genesis offer us two descrip- 
tions of creation, descriptions which disagree in material 
respects. In the first account, man as a species (‘‘male 
and female’’) is the last and crowning product of the 
creative process; in the second account, man as male is 
produced early in that process; and afterwards plants, 
animals, and finally woman, are created to keep him 
company. In the story of the flood, too, Noah is first 
directed to preserve two specimens (one couple) of 
every species, without distinction of clean or unclean; 
then, without suggestion of any divine change of mind, 
the command is to save seven couples of the clean beasts 
(Gen. v1.19; v1, 2). Jacob’s change of name is recorded 
twice, and the event located in different places, first at 
Peniel, second at Bethel (Gen. xxxu1, 27-30; xxxv, 10, 
15). Two explanations of the name Bethel (house of 
God) are furnished. One connects it with Jacob’s vision 
of angels and the heavenly ladder on his way to the east; 
the other with his meeting with God on his return from 
the east (Gen. xxvutt, 10-22; xxxv, 9-15). The death of 
Aaron is recorded twice; and located once on Mount 
Hor, and once at Mosera (Num. xxxutt, 38; Deut. x, 6). 
So, too, the separation of the tribe of Levi for sacramen- 
tal purposes is related twice, and with different accom- 
paniments (Num. 11, 5-8; Deut. x, 8). Three variant 
accounts of the laughter in connection with the birth of 
Isaac are given (Gen. xvu, 17; xvii, 12; xx1, 6), two of, 
   
-P-A-G-E-206
  198 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
Hagar’s expulsion from Abraham’s tent (Gen. xv1, 4-14; 
XXI, 9-21), and two of Moses’ reluctance to go to Pha- 
raoh, in one of which it is promised that Moses shall 
be “‘as God” to Aaron, and in the other ‘‘as God to 
Pharaoh” (Ex. rv, 10-16; v1, 29 to vu, 2). The spies 
sent into Canaan are differently commissioned in two 
places, and the reports credited to them on their return 
are conflicting, one being highly favorable to the nat- 
ural character of the country, while the other describes 
it as “‘a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof” 
(Num. x11, 2, 3, 21, and 17-20, 22, 26, 27, 32). There 
are three distinct references to the divine covenant 
name, Yahveh. According to Gen. rv, 26 (part of the 
J. document), this name was known to Adam’s grand- 
children,! whereas in Ex. v1, 2, 3, 6,8 (part of the P doc- 
ument), God is represented as saying to Moses, ‘‘I am 
Yahveh, and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, 
and unto Jacob, as God Almighty, but by my name 
Yahveh? I was not known to them.” Yet in Ex. 11, 
13-16 (the E document), the charge unto Moses is, 
“Say unto the children of Israel, Yahveh, the God of 
your fathers... hath sent me unto you. This is my 
name forever,” etc. 
Coincident with these differences in statement are 
differences in style, which critics regard as also pointing 
to multiple authorship. Our space limitations forbid 
their description here. Differences, too, in theological 
conception are not uncommon. Thus in the first account 
1 The name usually translated into English “the Lord” is in the He- 
brew text, Yahveh. 
2 The word Jehovah, which appears here in the Revised Version, is due 
to the practice of pronouncing the consonants in Yahveh by means of the 
vowels in the Hebrew word for “ the Lord,’”’ Yahveh having become tabu 
long before the Christian era. 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
  HISTORICAL INQUIRY 199 
of creation (the E MSS.) the process is by pure fiat, 
while in the second account it is by a kind of experimen- 
tation. After the human male had been formed and put 
in charge of the Garden of Eden, “‘ Yahveh God said [ap- 
parently as a new discovery], It is not good that the 
man should be alone,’’ whereupon the beasts and birds 
and woman were created. It was only then, too, it would 
seem, that Yahveh realized the need of names for these 
creatures, for then He “brought them unto the man to 
see what he would call them.” 
‘A second argument alleges the comparatively late date 
and non-Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch as such. 
The grounds of this contention could easily be given in 
detail, as in the sub-section above, did space permit. 
We shall have to confine ourselves to a few examples. 
(1) The topographical references often indicate that 
the author was a resident of Palestine and not of the 
Sinaitic wilderness. In Deuteronomy 1, 1, he states that 
the words of Moses were spoken ‘‘beyond Jordan in 
the wilderness” — a, description which implies that the 
writer was on the Canaan side of the river, which Moses 
never was. Moreover, his phrase for westward was sea- 
ward, which would not be correct at Sinai; and for south- 
ward it was ‘‘toward the Negeb”’ (or ‘‘parched land”’) — 
the dry steppe in the south of Judah. This again was 
an expression which a Hebrew would use only if he was a 
resident of Palestine. 
(2) The historical books show that much of the Pen- 
tateuch was unknown to Israel prior to the time of Jo- 
siah, late in the seventh century, B.c. On the religious 
and ceremonial side the distinctive thing about Deuter- 
onomy is its insistence upon the restriction of the sacri- 
fices to Jerusaiem and the Temple, and the destruction
-P-A-G-E-208
  200 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
of the ‘‘high places” or rival local altars. King Josiah 
yielded to this demand, but at first with no little as- 
tonishment. The people at large must have been as- 
tonished also; for the high places, with their associated 
pillars and poles, had been in use for the worship of 
Yahveh from the time of the patriarchs down. Samuel 
and Saul sacrificed to Yahveh repeatedly on the high 
places. So did the youthful King Solomon, going to 
Gibeon — described as “‘the great high place” of the time 
—and there Yahveh appeared to him (Judg. x1, 11, 
xx, 1;1 Sam. vu, 6, 9-11, 17; rx, 12-14, 25; x, 3, 5, 13; 
xiv, 35; 1 Kings 11, 4, 5 ff.) Elijah at Mount Carmel, 
as the very champion of Yahveh, “‘repaired the altar of 
Yahveh that was thrown down,” and succeeded in 
bringing down upon it Yahveh’s baptism of fire. Thus 
an old Yahvist altar, far from Jerusalem, and from the 
Deuteronomic point of view utterly improper, is dra- 
matically recognized by the divinity. A little later, at 
Horeb, it is one of Elijah’s chief grievances that ‘the 
children of Israel’’ had “‘thrown down” Yahveh’s altars, 
which evidently were many, and none of them doubt- 
less at Jerusalem in the neighboring kingdom of Judah. 
In other words, Elijah deplores as the triumph of 
heathenism the very acts which nearly three centuries 
later Josiah did in obedience to what purported to be 
the law of Moses! (1 Kings xvi, 30, 38; xrx, 14; 2 
Kings xxu, 11; xxi, 2-9.) 
As the legislation of Deuteronomy exalted the Jerusa- 
lem Temple worship, so the legislation of Ezra exalted 
the priesthood, or clergy. This also was evidently a 
new order of things. Samuel belonged to no priestly or 
Levitical family; yet, even as a child, he ministered be- 
fore Yahveh, wearing the ephod and the high-priestly
-P-A-G-E-209
HISTORICAL INQUIRY 201 
mantle. He actually slept “in the temple of Yahveh, 
where the ark of God was”’ — a thing sacrilegious under 
the full Pentateuchal system — and on various occa- 
sions seems to have offered public sacrifices. (1 Sam. 
Ix, 10-14, 19, 25; x11, 7-12; xvi, 2-5.) 
Such facts as the above, which are but a few out of 
many open to the observation of any careful reader of 
the Old Testament, have been the ready material of the 
hostile critic — the so-called ‘‘infidel’”’ — for genera- 
tions. Sometimes they are called ‘contradictions,” 
sometimes the ‘‘mistakes of Moses”; and are cited as 
evidence of the untrustworthiness of the Bible. How 
should an intelligent reader regard them? The usual 
course of the religious believer has been not to regard 
them at all — to ignore them; which is plainly deserting 
the field to the enemy. To the historico-literary critic 
they are not proofs of the dishonesty of the Biblical 
writers, but simply evidences that those writers were 
lacking in trained historical judgment and used their 
documentary sources in an uncritical way. 
Section 4. The Main Logical Methods of the Rival 
Schools 
A. The Critical Methods. 
From the survey just made of the critical arguments, 
fragmentary as it necessarily was, the general character 
of the inquiry must now be evident. First of all, it is 
manifestly an appeal to the facts of the subject-matter; 
second, it is an interpretation of those facts according to 
recognized historical canons. More particularly Old 
Testament critical inquiry is governed by the two great 
logical principles of science known as “‘positivism”’ and 
“scientific analogy.”’ The latter principle has been con-  
-P-A-G-E-210
  202 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
sidered in Chapter VI, and will be referred to later. Pos- 
itivism is the cardinal rule of science that the most cer- 
tain and the most authoritative elements of knowledge 
are the empirical facts; that is, the things vouched for by 
the direct evidence of the senses — our own senses or 
those of others. The other prominent factor in knowl- 
edge, namely, the ideas which the mind adds to these 
facts (explanations, laws, etc.), must be accommodated 
to the facts, not vice versa. For science ideas, no matter 
how venerable or imposing, are never coercive until the 
empirical facts make them so. Now, this is precisely 
the attitude of the higher critic to the facts of Old 
Testament history and life. He dares to maintam 
revolutionary conclusions in the face of ideas clothed 
with all the prestige of age-long opinion and ecclesiusti- 
cal pronouncements, because those conclusions are the 
coercive results of a careful and unbiased examination 
of the historical facts. 
B. Methods of the Traditional School. 
Modern scholarship has gone over to the critical view 
primarily because of its scientific character; but, also, in 
no small degree because of its confirmed distrust of the 
intellectual methods of the older view. In so far as 
these are distinctive, they may be reduced to three — 
tradition, authority, and a priori reasoning. 
(1) Tradition is the handing down from parent to 
child, or teacher to pupil, of observations and ideas of 
the past. This is done mostly by word of mouth; but 
not infrequently tradition’s story, at some point in its 
course, becomes more or less fixed by being reduced to 
writing. 
The present-day power of tradition appears to lie in
-P-A-G-E-211
  HISTORICAL INQUIRY 203 
the strong influence upon the mind of ideas received by 
it in its early, formative period, when interest is keen and 
impressions deep, reinforced by continual social sugges- 
tion in the form of the expressed opinions of others, the 
recitation of catechisms, creeds, etc. This influence of 
the ideas of older generations, this functioning of the 
past in the present, is proper enough in childhood; for 
only through it can the new personality of the child 
come into vital touch with the life of society; but it is no 
longer to be approved when the mind reaches maturity 
and becomes capable of judging things for itself. Its 
factors are ordinarily strong determinants of convic- 
tion; but in the field of thought their condemnation is 
that they are as effective on the side of wrong as of right 
beliefs. 
No doubt there are cases where tradition is a quasi- 
historical source, from which critical inquiry can derive 
certain probabilities as to past events otherwise unas- 
certainable; but even this standing is not to be conceded 
to ecclesiastical tradition regarding the Old Testament. 
It fails to cite a single eye- or ear-witness in support of 
its major claims. Its evidence, when traced up, leads 
only to the opinions of men — Josephus, for example — 
who lived long after the events they mention, and who 
well may have known no more about them than any 
well-read man of to-day. 
(2) Another main support of the traditional view is 
authority. Like tradition this is largely a matter of ac- 
cepting ideas by social suggestion, and without any se- 
rious question as to their rational grounds. Authority 
stands primarily for what the psychologist calls “ pres- 
tige suggestion’”’— the docile acceptance of ideas 
vouched for by men who are regarded as superior, either
-P-A-G-E-212
  204 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
in learning or ability or position. Among such men are 
the venerated heroes and teachers of the past, and at 
this point authority and tradition merge; but the au- 
thoritative teacher may also be in the present, and his 
deliverances relatively new and untraditional, as in the 
case of the Pope’s encyclical letter condemning ‘‘mod- 
ernism.” Authority in belief may also be recognized 
as residing in a great institution; such as the Roman 
Catholic Church, or in a venerated book, such as the 
Bible or the Koran. 
Authority often owes much to the reinforcement of its 
teachings by associated emotions and interests, as in the 
case of religion and patriotism. Some words, as Lowell 
says, 
“have drawn transcendent meanings up 
From the best passion of all by-gone time, 
Steeped through with tears of triumph and remorse, 
Sweet with all sainthood, cleansed in martyr fires.” 
Such words naturally have a vitality, a sacredness, and 
a compelling force, with which their mere rational co- 
gency would never have endowed them. Now, in the 
wide sphere of active life and purpose these personal 
and emotional — that is, essentially authoritative — 
factors in received beliefs are often of large importance 
and value; for, in the last analysis, life is more of a ven- 
ture than an applied science. In the field of reflective 
inquiry, however, where conclusions are sought which 
will fit in with all the rest of things in experience, these 
warm human determinants are out of place, indeed, in- 
truders; for they tend to override reason, and bias the 
intellectual outcome in an irrational way. 
There is, indeed, a qualified authority recognized in 
science, the authority of the proved expert; but this,
-P-A-G-E-213
  
HISTORICAL INQUIRY 205 
although proper, since it has been earned by laborious 
research and the attainment of special competence, is 
merely relative. It has its limits, and is always subject 
to correction by the judgment of other experts in the 
same field. With this exception scientific inquiry now 
has no place for authority in intellectual matters, be it 
seated in exalted persons, in widespread vogue, in in- 
stitutions, in books, or in creeds. For science it matters 
not in the least how many men have believed, and what 
notable religious leaders have taught, that Moses wrote 
Deuteronomy, if none of them was qualified to form a 
scientific opinion on the subject. Their views are to be 
classed with the opinion of the overwhelming majority 
of the race, past and present, that the earth is a flat disc. 
The traditional view of the Pentateuch is, of course, 
abundantly supported by ecclesiastical authority repre- 
sented in church fathers, prelates, councils, etc., and 
with impressive references to the penalty of anathema; 
but it can hardly be said to have any expert authority on 
its side. The nearest approach to that is the teaching 
of Saint Jerome — an eminent student of Hebrew who 
about 400 a.p. translated the Scriptures into Latin, 
making what is now known as the Vulgate version. Je- 
rome himself, however, did not claim to be a Hebrew ex- 
pert, but invited his critics, of whom then there were 
many, to “ask the most trustworthy Jew you can find, 
and see if he does not agree with me.”” That is, Jerome 
put into the Vulgate, not his own critical judgment, but 
the tradition of his Jewish teachers! Thus the second 
support of the traditional view proves likewise to be a 
broken reed. 
(3) The remaining support of that view is a priori 
reasoning; that is, reasoning conditioned and controlled
-P-A-G-E-214
    206 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
by initial assumptions. This in its place may be valid. 
In mathematics, for example, the reasoning is a priori; 
but then mathematics does not pretend to yield true 
conclusions about the actual world of objects and 
events, except in so far as that objective world corre- 
sponds with its own hypothetical world. Theological 
reasoning, however, is wont to start out with large exist- 
ential assumptions; that is, assumptions with the stand- 
ing, not of hypothesis, but of metaphysical and ethical 
certainties. For example, an American work on natural 
theology,’ which had much vogue a generation or two 
ago, argues regarding the Scriptures as follows: A di- 
vinely inspired Bible is a ‘‘moral necessity, because the 
moral constitution of man implies, in order to its devel- 
opment, a written revelation.” Man is ‘a cultivable 
being,”’ but ‘‘no species of things can improve itself... 
the culture must come in all cases from a nature higher 
than their own.”’? Essential to the process of improve- 
ment from above is a knowledge by man of God’s moral 
nature, which can be produced only through a written 
revelation. ‘‘Without revealed truth, reason has no 
data, faith is mere credulity, and conscience is misdi- 
rected.” Thus ‘‘the moral constitution of man de- 
mands a revelation ab extra — from without — as its 
complement.” 
So much for the apologist. It is evident that, if his in- 
itial assumptions are granted, there is much force in his 
plea. Man’s need of guidance and of incitement by 
something higher than himself is assuredly great. But 
how does this need, however sore, prove the existence of 
1J.B Walker, Philosophy of the Plan of Salvation, New York, 1841. 
2 This is an Aristotelian idea. It is found also in the New Testament; 
ef. John m1, 3.
-P-A-G-E-215
  HISTORICAL INQUIRY 207 
what will satisfy it? Evidently only on the author’s con- 
tident assumption that the world has a supreme moral 
Governor, who is intent upon bringing men to their 
highest possible development. That is, this theological 
writer starts his argument with a theory of history. 
Now, it is doubtless true that some working historical 
theory must underlie an account of events, if it is to be 
properly history and not mere annals; but what kind of 
atheory? The traditional view holds that it should be 
paternalistic, assuming a purposive and superintending 
Providence to be in charge of human affairs; and it 
chooses this theory apparently because it is interested 
chiefly in moral and religious ends — the guidance of 
practical life and the increase of peace and hope. ‘The 
critical view, on the other hand, being swayed by an in- 
tellectual rather than a moral interest —a desire to 
learn how things actually happen in the world! and 
to frame a coherent and credible account of events — 
adopts the naturalistic theory, according to which the 
history of every people is a natural development, an 
unfolding of its nature — that is, of group life and 
thought — under the conditioning influences of the en- 
vironment and of historical circumstance. From this 
point of view, which has opened up discoveries in the 
study of other ancient peoples, Hebrew literature is to 
be presumed, in the absence of serious evidence to the 
contrary, to have arisen in ways similar to the literature 
of other ancient peoples — those of Babylon and Greece, 
for example — and is to be interpreted by the same gen- 
1 The temper of the critical view was well expressed by a wise moralist 
nearly two centuries ago: “The constitution of nature is as it is.” 
“Things and actions are what they are, and the consequences of them 
will be what they will be; why, then, should we desire to be deceived?” 
(Bishop Butler, Sermon VII, last paragraph.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
    208 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
eral canons. A true understanding of it demands that 
we reconstruct imaginatively the historical situation in 
which its various parts, or books, arose. 
Does modern scholarship, then, regard historical ac- 
curacy as more important than moral welfare? By no 
means; but it holds that, when historical results are the 
ends sought, considerations of moral welfare are irrele- 
vant. To appeal to them for interpretation of state- 
ments of fact is illogical. Mention has been made al- 
ready of the fundamental scientific principle known as 
“scientific analogy.’”’ It consists in the accepted rule of 
science that, whenever possible, phenomena are to be 
explained by ideas known to apply in the field of investi- 
gation; and that no ideas imported from another field 
are to be trusted for interpretive purposes until their 
value in the new field has been established experimen- 
tally. According to this rule, Aristotle, in maintain- 
ing that the planets move in circular orbits, because the 
circle is the most perfect curve, invited the error into 
which he ran; for there is nothing to show that perfec- 
tion is a principle of control in astronomy. 
The like remark appears to apply to the paternalistic 
theory of history. Until the actuality of a superintend- 
ing Providence has been established, the use of that idea 
for historical and literary explanation is unscientific. 
On the practical side, the doctrine of Providence may 
be a proper article of faith and, through its stimulus 
to moral endeavor, may be a useful determinant of life; 
but, so long as it 7s faith and not knowledge, it cannot be 
used as a proof or support of anything claiming to be 
knowledge. Intellectually it is merely an hypothesis, 
and cannot possibly prove that other hypothesis, the 
Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch; for to justify one
-P-A-G-E-217
  HISTORICAL INQUIRY 209 
hypothesis by another is very like the blind leading the 
blind. 
It thus appears that the third main support of the 
traditional view, namely, a priori reasoning from theo- 
ries rather than established truths, falls to the ground, 
and falls, too, even when it is well articulated in itself. 
Modern thought is evidently quite justified in adopting 
the critical view; for its results have been reached by 
scientific processes, while the supports of the traditional 
view dissolve like pillars of fog under the clear light of 
impartial inquiry. 
In the case of most historical books it would not be 
needful to carry this discussion further; but we cannot 
and should not ignore the fact that in the western na- 
tions of the world the Bible is generally regarded as 
much more than a book of history. It is held to be a 
prime authority in morals and a saving guide in religion. 
But can it, and should it, continue to be so regarded if, 
as an historical record, it is subject to like errors with 
other ancient histories? Not a few have been quick to 
answer in the negative, and to deny it all moral or reli- 
gious authority. This view, in the face of the countless 
testimonials to the Bible’s value on the part of human- 
ity’s best and ablest, ancient and modern, is a hasty and 
far too sweeping judgment. If the Bible contains er- 
rors, and errors really integral to it, it evidently cannot 
be received by intelligent men as literally inspired by 
God. Two other ways, however, of recognizing and re- 
taining its power and value remain: 
(1) It may be held that the Scriptures contain ‘the 
word of God,” that is, a divine revelation. Some be- 
lievers who adopt this formula admit historical inac- 
curacies, but charge them to the human side of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  210 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
Bible, and claim inerrancy and authority for the divine 
side, namely, its moral and religious teachings. Unfor- 
tunately, these latter teachings, also, can be shown to be 
defective in places, sometimes seriously so. Thus no 
clear intellectual line of demarcation between man’s and 
God’s contributions to the Bible appears to be possible. 
Naturally enough traditionalists and radicals alike pro- 
nounce this theory of human and divine collaboration 
worthless, since it fails to show what parts of the Bible 
have any sort of divine backing. In reply, its more lib- 
eral defenders maintain that if no hard-and-fast scien- 
tific rule is furnished by it, yet for practical purposes the 
test of Coleridge is sufficient, that philosopher having 
held that those parts of the Bible are inspired ‘which 
find me”’; that is, those which aroused within him an 
adequate spiritual response. 
(2) The other theoretical way out is to renounce 
frankly all claim to special divine participation in the 
production of the Hebrew (and Christian) Scriptures, 
and to claim for them simply a first place in the spiritual 
literature of the world, a literature which it is possible 
to believe discovers intuitively and reflects convincingly 
divine truths and purposes of utmost moment to men. 
Such a claim is possible only for certain selected parts 
of those Scriptures (parts to be determined by Cole- 
ridge’s test) ; for much of their contents have to do with 
matters of only passing concern, and some of them are 
below the level of other ethical and religious writings. 
From this point of view the Bible owes its unique posi- 
tion in the religious world, partly to its high insights ex- 
pressed in everyday speech, and partly to the fact that 
so many generations of men of aspiration have ap- 
proved those insights and witnessed to them in, and
-P-A-G-E-219
  
HISTORICAL INQUIRY 211 
sometimes with, their lives. Coleridge’s test of spiritual 
truth, mentioned above, is evidently not a scientific one; 
for it does not appeal to a standard which is, or can 
be, common to all trained minds. On the contrary, it 
appeals to the individual mind. The teachings which 
actually awoke within him a spiritual response were 
doubtless dependent for their effect upon his emotional 
sensitiveness; and this is by no means alike in men of 
equal intellectual competency. 
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
1. Give a concrete example of the difference between external and in- 
ternal evidence. 
2. State and justify the critical inferences in the following sets of Bib- 
lical references: 
a. Exod. xxt, 1-6, and Deut. xv, 12-18, compared with Lev. xxv, 
39-46. 
b. Deut. xm, 1-14, Exod. xxvu, 1, 2 Chron. rv, 1, compared with 
Exod. xx, 24-26, 1 Sam. rx, 10-14, 19, 25, and 1 Kings m1, 2-5. 
3. It is stated in the Talmud that “ Moses wrote his own book... 
Joshua wrote his own book and... Samuel wrote his own book”. 
What inference regarding the authorship and date of Joshua is to 
be drawn from Josh. xx1v, 29 ff., and from a comparison of Josh. 
XI, 23, xv, 63, and Judges 1, 21, with 2 Sam. v, 4-10, and xxiv, 
18 ff.; and by comparing Josh. x, 13 with 2 Sam. 1, 17? 
4, What is to be inferred as to the date and authorship of the books of 
Samuel from 1 Sam. xxvii, 3; xxvu, 6; xxx, 23-25; and 2 Sam. 
vi, 8? Compare the accounts of how Saul became king in 1 Sam. 
chaps. viti to xi (especially chaps. vi, x, 17-27; and xu with 
chaps. Ix, x, 16, x1, 1-11), pointing out significant differences and 
drawing conclusions as to the origin of the book. Do the same 
with the story of David in 1 Sam. xv, 52, xvi, 14-23, xvi, 5-11, 
20-30, comparing these passages with chaps. xv to xvi, 4, 13-19. 
5. In June, 1916, the British Government reported the death of Lord 
Kitchener in the Atlantic Ocean; yet no witnesses testified to it, still 
less did any attendant physician certify to it. Why, then, should 
we believe the report? Are we violating the principle of positivism 
in doing so? If not, why not? 
6. If a friend, who had just attended a widely and pictorially adver- 
tised prestidigitation performance, assured you that he had seen 
the performer actually swallow a thirty-inch sword, in what ways, 
without impeaching his veracity, could you account for his state- 
ment and belief? .

7. A classmate of the present writer assured him that the absence of 
teeth at the sides of a horse’s mouth was clear evidence that the 
mouth was designed to hold the master’s bit: what scientific prin- 
ciple was violated in that claim? Explain the principle, and show 
its reasonableness. 
8. Make a brief outline of the argument in this chapter, and show how 
it leads up to the conclusions on pages 101, 102, 103, 104. (Any

   CHAPTER Ix 
REFLECTIVE THOUGHT IN THE FIELD OF VALUES 
Section 1. The Value Situation: Mediate and 
Immediate Values 
Hirverto our illustrations of the principles of sound 
thinking have all been drawn from those sciences which 
deal with the various aspects of our universe from the 
purely descriptive point of view, apart from all consid- 
erations of good or bad, better or worse. We have pur- 
sued this course because our primary interest has been 
to examine the way in which scientists who have ac- 
tually achieved knowledge have gone about that quest, 
and because it is in astronomy and mathematics and 
physics and biology that they have been most success- 
ful. Here, if anywhere, we can find those principles of 
discovery and testing actually displayed. With a clear 
realization of the part they play in the realm in which 
we can truly claim that knowledge is an accomplished 
fact, we can approach the difficult field of human rela- 
tionships with some assurance that we may find a path 
through the maze. 
So far, in our analysis of the typical act of thought, 
we have taken for granted, as given, the goal we had in 
mind. ‘The solution of a presented difficulty was the 
aim at which all of our suggestions were directed, and by 
their success in reaching that solution they were judged. 
Throughout we have assumed that that solution was 
something unquestionably desirable to arrive at, and all 
of our suggestions have been measured by their value as
-P-A-G-E-222
  214 REFLECTIVE THINKING — 
means to the attainment of that end. One suggestion 
was good, another bad, one was better than several 
others, as it effected the end which had all along stimu- 
lated our action, whether that end was the arrival in a 
certain place at a certain time, or the explanation of the 
movements of the heavenly bodies. The kind of value 
possessed by these suggestions is known as “‘mediate”’ 
value; that is, they are valuable as they serve as means 
to some end beyond themselves. It is obvious that the 
whole process of reflection which we have hitherto so 
closely examined is concerned with the measuring of 
various ‘‘mediate’’ values; nor is it too much to say that 
the whole of science is fruitful in so far as it enables us to 
decide with certainty just what are the best means of 
achieving certain desired results. 
Natural or descriptive science stops here, and does 
not go on to ask the further question of what results are 
to be desired, to be preferred to others. Science in it- 
self furnishes none of the ends of action; in so far as the 
knowledge of the scientist is concerned, it is immaterial 
whether what we know of high explosives is used to build 
a great reservoir to make the desert blossom as the rose, 
or to construct giant shells to snuff out the lives of an 
entire city. As a man the scientist may, nay, must, 
make some preference; but the grounds for that prefer- 
ence are not to be found in physics. 
How are these preferences themselves to be dealt 
with reflectively? Let ustakeasimple example. If we 
are bent upon getting downtown in the quickest possible 
time, it is easy to decide that the subway is a better 
mode of conveyance than the top of a bus, and it is no 
difficult matter to prove it to any one. If we desire to 
get downtown in the most comfortable way on this fine
-P-A-G-E-223
REFLECTION IN VALUES 215 
day, it is again easy to decide and to prove that the bus 
is the better method. So long as we accept the aim 
of either speed or comfort and raise no further question, 
we can arrive at a valid conclusion, easily tested, in ac- 
cordance with all the principles developed so far in this 
book. We have only to judge of bus and subway as 
means to the end we have already accepted. But sup- 
pose that we are in no special hurry, and yet do not 
desire to waste any time unnecessarily; how are we to 
decide whether we shall make the speed or the comfort 
our goal? It is good to ride on the top of a bus; it is 
also good not to waste an afternoon. Which is it bet- 
ter to do? 
Our decision could be made in several ways. We 
might toss a coin. We might accept the preference of 
our companion. We might say, ‘‘I haven’t ridden on a 
bus for some time; I think I’ll try it to-day.” But, in 
any of these cases, we should not be choosing reflec- 
tively, and we should not be able to prove that our choice 
was the better one, as we could prove which was quicker 
and which was more comfortable. Is there any way of 
proving that in this case speed is the better choice? Is 
there any way of proving that to build a reservoir is bet- 
ter than to construct giant shells? 
In the face of this problem of evaluating competing 
goods, and of working out some method which will giveus 
valid grounds for preferring one to the other, those who 
have given most consideration to the question are by ne 
means agreed. It may well be that very often it is im: 
possible to make such a preference anything more than a 
merely personal liking; it may well be that in many 
cases we cannot deal reflectively with such evaluation of 
ends. But one thing at least does seem fairly clear, 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
  
216 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
that, if reflection can enter into the matter at all, it 
must do so in certain definite ways. If we are to decide 
reflectively, when goods are compared with other goods, 
we cannot attempt to choose between them until all of 
the consequences that will flow from their acceptance, 
and all of the other values which are implied in them, 
have been carefully developed so far as lies in our 
power. Reflection can do very little if it tries to com- 
pare competing goods directly. We could set speed 
over against comfort, and be torn between them for so 
long as we wished; but, if we stopped there, we could 
get little basis for decision. We might, of course, feel 
that comfort made a greater appeal to us than speed, 
and hence choose the bus. But we could not prove to 
our companion that we were right; he would have to ac- 
cept our preference as a brute fact. But if we regard 
the two courses in the light of the further consequences 
with which they are bound up, and which must follow if 
either is chosen, then we are in a better position to make 
. an objective judgment. We can then realize that the 
extra half-hour spent on the bus may make it impossible 
to go to the play to-night; that, after all, the bus seats 
are very tiring; that if we took the subway we could 
stop in at the station and inquire about trains; and hay- 
ing before us, as it were, the complete pictures of what 
is likely to follow in either case, we can not only decide 
that it is the second rather than the first state of affairs 
which we desire to bring about, but we can also prove to 
our friend that he, too, wants to go to the theater, and 
hence accepts speed as the better end in this instance. 
It thus seems possible to evaluate various courses of 
action only when we are in a position to know how they 
will lead to or affect other things or actions which, for
-P-A-G-E-225
REFLECTION IN VALUES 217 
the time being at least, we accept without further ques- 
tion. Ends can be evaluated reflectively only when 
they are regarded in the light of still further ends to 
which they may contribute. Other things being equal, 
that end is the better end which the better effects still 
further good. In this further good there must, of 
course, be included the immediate satisfaction of de- 
sires which is attendant upon the acceptance and enjoy- 
ment of any good; and, if I do like to ride on the bus 
much better than on the subway, the satisfaction I 
should derive from taking the bus must play an impor- 
tant part in the completed picture of the effects of taking 
it. This immediately satisfying quality which objects 
possess is known as their ‘‘immediate” or “‘intrinsic,” 
as distinguished from their ‘“‘mediate,” value; a good 
can satisfy us both in itself, and also through its effect 
in producing a further good which can satisfy us in 
itself. Thus it is pleasant to ride on a bus, even if one 
does not care to go anywhere in particular; and a bus 
can also get one to a theater which will offer a pleasant 
afternoon. But it is usually impossible to choose be- 
tween goods merely on the basis of this inherent satis- 
faction which they offer. The contention has been 
that, when it comes to measuring the relative value of 
two courses of action, we can come nearest to objective 
certainty when we take account of their mediate, as 
well as their immediate, aspect; when we see the whole 
picture and not the bare sketch. 
The outcome, then, of our examination of the princi- 
ples of the process of evaluation has been to make it but 
a special case of the typical act of reflective thinking. It 
is true that most things possess an immediate value, 
either positive or negative; that they are in themselves
-P-A-G-E-226
    218 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
good and intrinsically satisfying, or the opposite. It is 
true that in many cases this immediate good may be 
that aspect of them which on first consideration makes 
the strongest appeal. But it is at the same time true 
that, if we considered this intrinsic appeal alone, we 
should never be sure that we had really decided most 
wisely ; and since, in the nature of things, such an appeal 
must remain private and of little objective cogency, if 
we are to decide rationally and intelligently we must not 
stop with first appearances, but must go on to elabo- 
rate upon all the consequences of the various possible 
courses, to choose clearly some end which we will adopt 
as a standard, and to ascertain which of the courses will 
best effect that end. 
It is obvious that the unquestioned ends which are ac- 
cepted as the outcome of the process of elaboration are 
but preferences, in the sense that they are assumed to be 
good without further proof. When two men conflict 
upon these preferences, there can be but one way of 
reaching agreement. These preferences must them- 
selves be subjected to elaberation and clarification, un- 
til it is made plain that the acceptance of one or the 
other will bring with it some still further good upon 
which the two disputants can agree. Suppose, as in the 
case which forms the basis of one of the following chap- 
ters, two men disagree about the legislative enactment 
of a maximum working day for women. If each con- 
tented himself with insisting upon the correctness of his 
own position, they might argue all day without produc- 
ing any effect upon each other’s convictions. But in 
actual practice each would try to show just what his so- 
lution would bring with it, and in the course of that elab- 
oration the two would probably agree upon some other
-P-A-G-E-227
  
REFLECTION IN VALUE 219 
good which both wanted to bring about. In this case, 
both would admit that the general health and welfare of 
the community was an end upon which they could agree, 
It would then be a comparatively simple matter to es- 
tablish by the citing of statistical and experimental evi- 
dence whether an eight-hour day did or did not effec- 
tively promote the general welfare. Thus, what had at 
first seemed to be a problem in evaluating ends could be 
turned into a mere question of testing two alternative 
means to an end, and that could be decided upon the 
basis of the knowledge we possess of industrial life. 
If two men could reach no agreement whatsoever 
upon any thing that both considered good, then, of 
course, it would be impossible to choose reflectively be- 
tween their proposals; the final choice would needs be 
based upon their irrational preference for one of the 
alternatives. Frequently reflection does find itself thus 
impotent to effect any agreement; and in such cases of 
conflict, when the circumstances preclude an agree-, 
ment to disagree, it may become necessary to appeal to 
unreasoning force, either through a majority vote, or 
through recourse to arms. Two nations can thus fly 
at each other’s throats when they both decide that the 
safety and glory of their own race is an ultimate good, 
and refuse to think of the effect of a victory upon the hu- 
man race asa whole. But even here, where through lack 
of any accepted standard reflection finds itself unable 
to effect a process of ultimate evaluation, through the 
elaboration and clarification of the various choices it 
can eliminate the necessity of such an appeal to force 
before all the returns are in. It might well prove that 
the patriot would prefer his country to perish upon the 
altar of national glory; but at least in making such a
-P-A-G-E-228
220 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
choice he could be brought to realize the full price such 
victory would entail. 
If this process of elaboration is to be succeeded by a 
genuine process of evaluation, however, in which alter- 
natives are tested in the light of some more ultimate 
standard, that standard must be accepted by both par- 
ties. In any given process of evaluation, some preferred 
end must remain unquestioned. Just how fundamental 
that preference must be depends upon how fundamental 
is the conflict between competing goods; the choice be- 
tween tennis and rowing as sports is much easier to 
make than the choice between a democratic and an aris- 
tocratic way of life. But, in any case, the preference 
must be pushed back until some good is reached which 
in the ensuing process of evaluation remains unques- 
tioned. 
Thus, when it becomes necessary to choose between 
two ends which offer themselves, three things are in- 
volved. First, those ends must be carefully elaborated 
until the complete picture is before us. Secondly, some 
further end must be agreed upon. Finally, those com- 
peting ends must themselves be treated as means, and 
evaluated as they serve to effect the further end. Re- 
flection can thus clarify ends and evaluate means; but 
the acceptance of a standard for that evaluation re- 
mains something into which reflection cannot enter. 
That is a fundamental preference to be made upon a 
basis of experience and acquaintance. 
Section 2. The Dogmatic and the Reflective Methods of 
Evaluation 
We have described the process of evaluation in simple 
terms, as though it were the most obvious thing in the
-P-A-G-E-229
REFLECTION IN VALUES 221 
world to apply the principles of reflective thinking to 
any conflict between values. But unfortunately it has 
not always been so, and even at the present time it is but 
rarely that men will consent to employ reason in this all- 
important field. Far too frequently they accept certain 
types of act as good or bad in themselves, and then re- 
fuse to admit even the possibility of a test in the case 
of conflict, through reference to further consequences. 
This is the utter negation of reason, and means the 
removal of the field of values entirely from the realm 
of reflection. These absolutely good or bad acts are 
accepted, in theory at least, either on authority, as 
divinely bestowed in some sacred code of laws, or else 
as intuitively perceived to be binding. In any case of 
actual conflict, the question is not whether one choice 
would effect what, on rational consideration, seems to 
be the best result; it is which commandment is to be 
applied. Those acts that are commanded have been 
commanded, and obedience must be unquestioning; 
those truths which are self-evident it would be sac- 
rilegious to subject to scrutiny and reflective criticism. 
It may very well prove that, when these objectives 
that are accepted as absolutely good are evaluated re- 
flectively, they will prove worthy of the confidence that 
men have placed in them. In fact, as we have already 
seen, no evaluative process can take place without some 
standard accepted, for the time being at least, as un- 
questionably good. Yet so often have the aims which 
men thus dogmatically imposed upon themselves and 
others resulted in evil and suffering, that it appears that 
to regard any values as quite removed from the possibil- 
ity of further criticism is exceedingly apt to mean that 
they are incapable of any rational justification whatso-
-P-A-G-E-230
222 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
ever. We shall have occasion to examine the function 
which such standards do perform in the evaluative proc- 
ess; but here we must assume that the more that prow 
ess can be made genuinely reflective and the less we 
must take refuge in a dogmatic statement of preferences, 
the more likely we are to arrive at objective truth about 
values. 
A different way of attacking the same problem is to 
say: “Let us forget for the moment that you say this 
must be done, and I say that must be done. Let us try 
to find out if we cannot agree on something of which we 
should both approve, and which we could both try to 
get. If we can agree on this good thing, then perhaps 
we shall not find it so hard to argue intelligently about 
the best way of getting it.” If such an undertaking 
were carried on, each advocate might tell why he 
thought the end he desired was good. Its implications 
would be pointed out. All of the further consequences 
it carried with it would be displayed as things which 
would have to be accepted if it were taken. Thus an at- 
tempt might be made to show just what values were 
bound up with that end. When its consequences had 
thus been clearly put before both disputants, they 
might well say, “We agree on this as our goal; now let 
us see how we can best secure it.” 
These two methods of evaluating goods we have 
called the “dogmatic” and the ‘‘reflective” ways. The 
dogmatic method holds that there are certain things 
that are beyond all peradventure of doubt right and 
good, and that they should be aimed at, be the conse- 
quences what they may — fiat justitia, ruat celum. The 
reflective method holds that, however good things may 
be in themselves, if it become necessary to choose, that
-P-A-G-E-231
  REFLECTION IN VALUES 223 
choice must be made in the light of further goods. In 
this distinction “dogmatic” is not used in any deprecia- 
tive sense; assuredly the more reasonable mode may be, 
at times, to adopt the dogmatic position. But that 
cannot alter the fact that such a position does exclude 
reflection. 
No more illuminating example could be found to illus- 
trate these two methods of dealing with values than the 
contrast between the two great historic series of argu- 
ments in favor of the general principles of democracy, 
the absolutistic and dogmatic assertions of the natural 
rights school, as found in the classic American Declara- 
tion of Independence and the French Declaration of the 
Rights of Man, and the equally classic arguments of the 
Utilitarians. Wequotetheadmirable summary of Bryce. 
“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are 
created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with 
certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, 
and the pursuit of Happiness, that to secure these rights, 
Governments are instituted, deriving their just powers from 
the consent of the governed.” (American Declaration of In- 
dependence, 1776.) 
“Men are born and continue equal in respect of their rights. 
“The end of political society is the preservation of the natu- 
ral and imprescriptible rights of man. These Rights are lib- 
erty, property, security, and resistance to oppression. 
“The principle of all Sovereignty resides essentially in the 
nation. No body, no individual, can exert any authority 
which is not expressly derived from it. 
“All citizens have a right to concur personally, or through 
their representatives in making the law. Being equal in its 
eyes, then, they are all equally admissible to all dignities, 
posts, and public employments. 
“No one ought to be molested on account of his opinions, 
even his religious opinions.” (Declaration of the Rights of
-P-A-G-E-232
  224 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
Man made by the National Assembly of France, August, 
1789.) 
These two declarations, delivered authoritatively by two 
bodies of men at two moments of far-reaching historical im- 
portance, contain the fundamental dogmas, a sort of Apos- 
tles’ Creed, of democracy. They are the truths on which it 
claims to rest, they embody the appeal it makes to human 
reason. Slightly varied in expression, their substance may 
be stated as follows: 
Each man who comes into the world comes into it Free, 
with a mind to think for himself, a will to act for himself. 
The subjection of one man to another except by his own free 
will is against Nature. All men are born Equal, with an 
equal right to the pursuit of happiness. That each man may 
secure this right and preserve his liberty as a member of a 
community, he must have an equal share in its government, 
that government being created and maintained by the con- 
sent of the community. Equality is the guarantee of inde- 
pendence. 
These axioms, being delivered as self-evident truths, ante- 
eedent to and independent of experience, require no proof. 
They are propounded as parts of the universal Law of Nature, 
written on men’s hearts, and therefore true always and every- 
where. 
While the Declarations of the Natural Rights of Man made 
at Philadelphia and at Paris were resounding through the 
world, there were other thinkers who, like some Greek philos- 
ophers more than two thousand years before, were drawing 
from the actual experience of mankind arguments which fur- 
nished another set of foundations on which democracy might 
rest. Testing the value of a principle by its practical results, 
they propounded a number of propositions, some of which 
may be given as familiar examples. 
Liberty is a good thing, because it develops the character of 
the individual, and conduces to the welfare of the commu- 
nity. When one man, or a few men, rule over others, some 
of the subjects are sure to resent control and rebel against it, 
troubling the general peace. No one is good enough to be 
entrusted with unlimited power. Unless he be a saint — 
perhaps even if he be a saint — he is sure to abuse it.
-P-A-G-E-233
REFLECTION IN VALUES 225 
Every man is the best judge of his own interest, and there- 
fore best knows what sort of government and what laws will 
promote that interest. Hence those laws and that govern- 
ment will presumably be the best for a community as a whole 
which are desired by the largest number of its members. 
Two men are presumably better able than one to judge 
what is for the common good. Three men are wiser still, and 
soon. Hence the larger the number of members of the com- 
munity who have the right to give their opinion, the more 
likely to be correct (other things being equal) is the decision 
reached by the community. 
Individual men may have selfish aims, possibly injurious to 
the community, but these will be restrained by the other 
members of the community whose personal aims will be dif- 
ferent. Thus the self-regarding purposes of individuals will 
be eliminated, and the common aims which the bulk of the 
community desires to pursue will prevail. 
As every man has some interest in the well-being of the 
community, a part at least of his own personal interest being 
bound up with it, every man will have a motive for bearing 
his share in its government, and he will seek to bear it, so far 
as his personal motives do not collide therewith. 
Inequality, by arousing jealousy and envy, provokes dis- 
content. Discontent disturbs the harmony of a community 
and induces strife. Hence equality in political rights, while 
it benefits the community by opening to talent the opportu- 
nity of rendering good service, tends also to peace and good 
order. 
To sum up, government by the whole people best secures 
the two main objects of all Governments — Justice and Hap- 
piness, Justice, because no man or class or group will be 
strong enough to wrong others; Happiness, because each man, 
judging best what is for his own good, will have every chance 
of pursuing it. The principles of liberty and equality are 
justified by the results they yield.! 
Why does the absolutist demand liberty and equality? 
Because they are Natural Rights with which all men are 
1 Bryce, Modern Democracies, vol. 1, pp. 43-45.
-P-A-G-E-234
  226 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
born. They are not subject to doubt. They are indel- 
ibly graven on the heart of every right-thinking man. 
They are beyond proof. They just are. Why does the 
man who reflectively considers consequences demand the 
same things? Because they conduce to the welfare of 
the community, to the general peace, to justice, to the 
common happiness — all of them things which even the 
opponents of democracy desire to effect. The first group 
state their demands categorically, and enforce them 
with their swords; the second explain why theirs will 
produce results which their opponents profess equally 
to advocate, and appeal to reason rather than to arms. 
It is significant that in France, where the absolutistic 
Natural Rights theory was made the defense of democ- 
racy, and was opposed by a similarly dogmatic divine 
right theory of autocracy, the political change was 
achieved only by a bloody and violent revolution. Be- 
tween men committed irrevocably to such contradictory 
beliefs about values, there was no way but force. On 
the other hand, in England, which on the whole adopted 
the opposing type of defense, the same change was 
accomplished peaceably and not wholly irrationally. 
Each side, accepting as its ultimate aim the common 
good, was able to claim that its system of government 
best effected that aim, and the autocrats and the demo- 
crats, being about equal in strength, could each demand 
that the other listen to their arguments. Reason here 
had at least a certain chance to develop its case. 
It is, of course, quite possible to defend autocracy 
upon purely reflective and empirical grounds. It is 
worthy of note that many present-day writers attack 
democracy and favor some form of monarchy in gov- 
ernment, with aristocracy in social structure. Some
-P-A-G-E-235
REFLECTION IN VALUES 227 
of their arguments against democracy are reviewed by 
Delisle Burns: 
If there is a choice of leaders by the common man, either 
he chooses some incompetent person whom he can under- 
stand, and thereby ruins society, or he makes democracy 
impossible by choosing an exceptional man who cannot 
easily be controlled by the average intellect. Again it is 
said that no democratic organization can possibly give due 
power to minorities. . . .Thirdly, democracy is said to be ir- 
reconcilable with social organization for rapid and effective 
group action.... Finally ...it is argued that the majority 
of men are not capable of original action and full personal 
responsibility. 
These arguments imply, on the whole, that the good of 
the majority is the ultimate aim, but that democracy is 
an ineffective means to its attainment. Other writers 
go still further, and deny that the good of the majority 
is the best end; ‘‘rather a few highly developed,” they 
say, ‘‘even at the expense of suffering in others, than a 
vast rabble of mediocrities.” These latter writers no 
longer admit the ultimate aim which the democrats pro- 
fess, and hence make rational argument with democrats 
impossible unless some further end, some type of life, 
can be agreed upon. But if there is any common ground 
whatsoever, it is possible to introduce reflective think- 
ing into the great field of values just as into every other 
branch of knowledge. 
Section 3. The Reflective Elaboration of Ends 
We have already outlined the general method which 
reflection must follow if it is to accomplish any fairly 
definite and objective results in the field of values. We 
have seen that the first service which reflection can per- 
1 Political Ideals, pp. 297-98. 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
  228 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
form is to develop the various courses of action or goods 
which are competing for our acceptance. It can reveal 
to us many of the further consequences which they will 
each entail. This process is essentially that of the 
fourth stage of the complete act of thinking, the stage in 
which the implications of the various suggestions are 
carefully elaborated. And, like that stage, it depends 
essentially upon the knowledge at our disposal of the 
causal patterns that do obtain. What will follow if we 
do perform certain actions? What things are valuable 
as means to further goods? We must possess this pre- 
liminary knowledge before we can either clarify our ends 
or evaluate them through reference to some further 
standard. 
This process is exceedingly complicated, for the knowl- 
edge we need in this field is very hard to come by. We 
shall, therefore, in this section indicate some of the main 
difficulties in the way of obtaining that knowledge, and 
attempt to suggest ways by which those obstacles may 
be surmounted. We must not assume, however, that 
the way will be easy or clear, or that we can hope to at- 
tain that same measure of general agreement, even upon 
causal relations, that the natural scientist regards as 
the prerequisite of any definitely established body of 
knowledge. The reasons for the comparatively chaotic 
confusion in which the whole field of human relation- 
ships, with which the problems of evaluation so largely 
deal, finds itself to-day, will become clear as we advance. 
For that field at present forms a marked contrast with 
the achievements which the natural scientist so proudly 
records. Despite the fact that human intelligence has 
been reflectively occupied with the problems of the rela- 
tions between man and man for a much longer time,
-P-A-G-E-237
  
REFLECTION IN VALUES 229 
than with those of our physical environment, and that 
many more men have devoted their attention to them; 
despite the fact that the pathfinders, from the great 
Greeks, Socrates and Plato and Aristotle, down, who 
have sought to blaze a way here, have most certainly 
not been inferior to any of the pioneers of natural sci- 
ence — it is unquestioned that these so-called social sci- 
ences have had little share in the growth characteristic 
of our knowledge of nature since the Renaissance, and 
that we are still pretty much where the Greeks left us 
two thousand years ago. 
When the intellectual history of this time comes to be writ- 
ten [says H. G. Wells], nothing, I think, will stand out more 
strikingly than the empty gulf in quality between the superb 
and richly fruitful scientific investigations that are going on, 
and the general thought of other educated sections of the 
community. I do not mean that scientific men are, as a 
whole, a class of supermen, dealing with and thinking about 
everything in a way altogether better than the common run 
of humanity, but in their field they think and work with an 
intensity, an integrity, a breadth, boldness, patience, thor- 
oughness, and faithfulness — excepting only a few artists — 
which puts their work out of all comparison with any other 
human activity. ... In these particular directions the human 
mind has achieved a new and higher quality of attitude and 
gesture, a veracity, a self-detachment, and self-abnegating 
vigor of criticism that tend to spread out and must ultimately 
spread out to every other human affair. 
James Harvey Robinson gives an even more striking 
example: 
When we compare the discussions in the United States Sen- 
ate in regard to the League of Nations with the consideration 
of a broken-down car at a roadside garage, the contrast is 
shocking. The rural mechanic thinks scientifically; his only 
aim is to avail himself of his knowledge of the nature and  
-P-A-G-E-238
    230 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
workings of the car, with a view to making it run once more. 
The Senator, on the other hand, appears too often to have lit- 
tle idea of the nature and workings of nations, and he relies 
on rhetoric and appeals to vague fears and hopes or mere par- 
tisan animosity. The scientists have been busy for a century 
in revolutionizing the practical relation of nations. The 
ocean is no longer a barrier, as it was in Washington’s day, 
but to all intents and purposes a smooth avenue closely con- 
necting, rather than safely separating, the eastern and west- 
ern continents. The Senator will nevertheless unblushingly 
appeal to policies of a century back, suitable, mayhap, in 
their day, but now become a warning rather than a guide. 
The garage-man, on the contrary, takes his mechanism as he 
finds it, and does not allow any mystic respect for the earlier 
forms of the gas engine to interfere with the needed adjust- 
ments.! 
What is the reason for this startling contrast? Why 
do we apply intelligence to the repair of our automobiles 
and refuse to apply it to the much more important hu- 
man relationships? Is it merely, as multitudes would 
have it, that we lack the will, and that a simple resolve 
to be intelligent, to employ reflective thinking, if it could 
only be carried out, would result in as revolutionary 
changes in social conditions as has the application of 
scientific thought to our control over the forces and re- 
sources of Nature? Need we only to repent and be con- 
verted? 
Assuredly, our souls need repentance, and there can- 
not be laid too great emphasis on the necessity for the 
most intense application of reflective thinking to the 
problems of man. That is why we have examined and 
formulated the methods that have in the natural sci- 
ences proved so successful. But we must recognize, if 
we would hope for anything like the results that have 
1The Mind in the Making, p. 8.
-P-A-G-E-239
  REFLECTION IN VALUES | 281 
been therein achieved, that the field of human relation- 
ships presents difficulties beside which any in the natural 
sciences seem simplicity itself. The backwardness of the 
social sciences is not due to any neglect by the pathfinder, 
for it is probable that the amount of reflective thinking 
devoted to these problems far exceeds that spent on the 
interpretation of nature. It is due to causes which are 
in the nature of things ineradicable, and, unless we de- 
sire these difficulties to remain insuperable, we must 
frankly recognize their existence and endeavor to coun- 
teract them. 
We have seen that the prerequisites for the formation 
and testing of suggestions are a body of exact and classi- 
fied knowledge of the general laws or patterns we may 
expect to discover, comparative freedom from prejudice 
and preconceptions, and the possibility of exact and 
careful experimentation. In the field of values none of 
these essentials is to be discovered. We have very few 
definitely established laws upon which we can count in 
social phenomena, we have very intense loyalties and 
prejudices, and we have practically no means of experi- 
mentation on an adequate scale. Hence it is exceed- 
ingly difficult even to evaluate goods as means to further 
goods. We lack the primary knowledge of what certain 
courses of action will actually accomplish. 
The first and most obvious obstacle in the building up 
of a definite body of knowledge here is the difficulty of 
discovering general laws that will simplify the initial 
confusion and complexity which greet us in every field 
of investigation. At first glance nature, too, seems 
singularly complicated, and the riotous profusicn of 
form and process in a forest seems to the ordinary man 
chaos itself. Yet it takes but the most elementary  
-P-A-G-E-240
    232 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
knowledge for that confusion to shape itself into a har- 
monious order; forms are seen to resemble each other, 
processes to repeat themselves with unfailing regularity. 
The pattern of causal relationships is, indeed, many- 
colored, but the same design is repeated through the 
whole range of nature, and when once its essential motifs 
have been discovered, we know what to look for at each 
spot. There is a pattern that enables us to predict with 
fair accuracy and precision what events each new mo- 
ment will bring forth, and the utilization of that knowl- 
edge has verily extended the bounds of human empire 
over nature. 
Not so in the field of human activities. If there be 
any pattern in the warp and woof of man’s social experi- 
ence, it has been so obscured by loose ends and tangled 
skeins that men have hitherto been unable to trace it. 
The complexity in the field of human affairs consists not 
so much in the chaotic profusion of the individual facts 
of that experience, for in this it differs little from the 
realm of nature; it lies rather in the inability of man to 
find any simple laws upon which those facts can be 
strung. This makes it well-nigh impossible to predict 
what will occur, and without prediction man is at a loss 
to control. 
It is both a cause and a result of this condition that 
mathematics, so successful in the interpretation of na- 
ture, seems quite impossible of application to human na- 
ture. The loss which the inability to use this invaluable 
tool entails is incalculable. It means that accurate 
measurements are precluded; in society we are to-day 
where the physicist was as regards heat before he had 
invented a thermometer. It means that we cannot 
formulate our social hypotheses with the precision lent
-P-A-G-E-241
REFLECTION IN VALUES 233 
by mathematics. It means that we are unable to elab- 
orate them deductively and arrive at further exact 
knowledge. It means that in the last analysis we find 
ourselves at a great disadvantage in testing them. 
There is, however, one method by which the facts of so- 
cial phenomena seem to lend themselves to quantitative 
treatment: that is the newly discovered science of statis- 
tics. By the aid of statistics we can measure in the 
large what we cannot in the small; and it seems probable 
that, with the increasing application of the statistical 
method, that accuracy which mathematics gives may 
be able to increase our knowledge and understanding of 
the complexities of the social sciences. So important is 
this, and so hopeful appears the possibility of overcom- 
ing this tremendous difficulty in the way of reflection, 
that a special chapter will be devoted to the method of 
handling such problems by statistics. 
It must not be forgotten, however, that, when all has 
been said, there enter so many incalculable elements 
into the actions of human beings that it is still quite im- 
possible for us to tell, in any individual case, just what 
will be the outcome of any particular act which they per- 
form. We can predict with fair accuracy how many 
men will commit suicide and how many men will marry 
in a given community in a year; but such a general 
statement will not satisfy our demands in the field of hu- 
man relationships. We wish to know whether John 
Smith will commit suicide or marry; and that we cannot 
predict. We are really asking for much more refined 
knowledge in the field of values than we ever ask for in 
natural science. There individual differences are mat- 
ters of little concern; here they are all-important. Since 
our demands are so much greater, it is not surprising 
that our results are less satisfactory. 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
    234 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
But it is not merely the actual difficulties of the sub- 
ject-matter that have kept back the social sciences; 
even if we knew how to do what we wished, we should 
still find ourselves bound up in a network of old associa- 
tions, of traditions and tender memories, of blind preju- 
dices and hatreds. The natural scientist is investigat- 
ing a field in which after all the average man has very 
little interest, and he is for the most part quite free to 
follow facts whithersoever he finds that they lead. His 
conclusions do not conflict with beliefs held dear by 
men from time immemorial, for the simple reason that 
they lie in a realm which the average man has never ex- 
perienced, and in which, consequently, he has no beliefs 
at all. It is far different with human relationships. 
Here every man has a vital interest; the beliefs here are 
bound up with emotional associations and interests 
which make every change a mutilation of the living 
flesh. If even the natural scientist has in the past found 
his way blocked by such established beliefs; if a Galileo 
feels the censure of the Church for maintaining that the 
earth moves, or if a Darwin and a Huxley are subjected 
to the taunts and jibes of the unthinking for declaring 
the record of the past, how much more will the man who 
finds it necessary to revise the fundamental ways in 
which men live feel the sting of social disapproval and 
hostility! 
In the first chapter mention was made of the numer- 
ous obstacles that strew the path of the investigator in 
any field, the masses of prejudice and preconception, 
the still more powerful inertia of habit and tradition 
that prevent a frank and free investigation of truth. It 
needs but to be pointed out here that it is in the social 
sciences that it is most difficult to avoid them. Even
-P-A-G-E-243
  
REFLECTION IN VALUES 235 
the enlightened mind can never wholly escape their in- 
fluence, and many of the greatest pathfinders have re- 
tained far more of traditional ideas and prejudices than 
they would care to admit even to themselves. It is a 
great mistake to regard those men who often stand in 
the way of scientific progress as consummate villains be- 
cause they cannot tear themselves loose from the mass 
of inherited beliefs in which their minds are embedded. 
To the ardent seer of new visions of life made more per- 
fect, it is exceedingly difficult to avoid attributing the 
most sinister of motives to all those who still feel the 
grip of the old. But this in itself is but to give way toa 
deep-rooted tendency of the human mind that enters 
in to obscure judgment: the desire to regard all who in- 
tellectually disagree with one as morally bad. Which of 
us is there who is himself without such sin? Nothing 
is more disheartening than the fitful flashes and shadows 
of the mind that is thoroughly convinced of its own en- 
lightenment, the genuine bigotry of the emancipated. 
It is inevitable that beliefs endeared by long association, 
perhaps learned at the mother’s knee, should seem com- 
pelling in the face of disagreeable facts whose only value 
is that they are true; who of us, however much he may 
be convinced by his reason of the futile horror of war- 
fare, can fail to feel a martial thrill as the band plays, 
the flags fly, and the soldiers come marching down the 
street? Prejudices and selfish interests offer perhaps 
the greatest single obstacle to the achievement of knowl- 
edge in the social sciences; and yet they must be ac- 
cepted as inevitable factors in the situation, with which 
men must reckon, and to remove which they must de- 
vote much of the precious time that might have been 
spent in the direct ascertaining of knowledge. 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
236 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
Moreover, in the third place, there is this much of rea- 
son on behalf of the conservatives, that in the social sci- 
ences it is extremely difficult to experiment patiently 
in the laboratory. In fact, there exists no laboratory. 
The maxim of experimentum in corpore vili has no mean- 
ing, for no corpus vile exists. No human being is cheap 
enough to risk the danger of failure. Hence the neces- 
sity of carrying on social experimentation in the realm of 
the imagination, where a single false step will not result 
in hardship and suffering. And the imaginative foresee- 
ing of consequences is in human relationships so much 
more difficult than in the natural sciences that it is com- 
monly said that no plan of social change is worth any- 
thing until it has been tried out. When a great nation 
like Russia elects to engage in social experimentation 
upon an enormous scale, we may be intensely interested, 
and watch with the utmost sympathy, but we cannot 
help regretting the inevitable failures and mistakes 
which must precede even an eventual success. We can 
only do the best we can, experiment on a small scale, 
proceed slowly, test carefully so far as we are able, and 
endeavor always to project into the future every possible 
consideration before we set about the actual verification 
of our suggestions. 
These are the difficulties which have made it so hard 
to find in the field of social relationships the fundamen- 
tal causal patterns upon whose discovery depends all 
evaluation of means, and ultimately of ends also. We 
can elaborate and evaluate only as we can perceive the 
consequences and implications of our choices; and in so- 
ciety we are never sure what will be the result of a given 
act. Before we can go much further, we must discover 
definite causal patterns, with all the accuracy statistics 
   
-P-A-G-E-245
REFLECTION IN VALUES 237 
can furnish. We must rid ourselves of prejudices and 
preconceptions and allow reflection a fair chance. And 
we must experiment patiently and carefully, in actuality 
and in imagination. 
Section 4. The Reflective Criticism of Standards 
But after all the most serious problems which the con- 
sideration of values in human relationships presents to 
us lie not in our inability to state with any certainty just 
what will be the consequences of one of our acts or 
choices; difficult as is the actual amassing of classified 
knowledge in this field, it is not absolutely insuperable. 
Modern psychological and statistical methods have en- 
abled us to discover far more of the patterns of the so- 
cial life of men than we had dreamed possible a few 
years ago. If agreement can be reached upon the de- 
sirability of aiming at some definite state of affairs, it 
is usually not impossible to establish with a fair degree 
of certainty that one proposed course will be more apt 
to bring about that state than another. Thus, to re- 
fer again to the example of the chapter on law, when 
once men have decided that the health and welfare of 
the community as a whole is an end to be preferred to 
the high profits of private individuals, it is not so very 
difficult to prove by statistical observation that unre- 
stricted hours for the labor of women are much less apt 
to effect that end than the legislative enforcement of an 
eight-hour day. Could men once agree on the kind of 
liberty and equality which a government should secure, 
it is not impossibly hard to determine whether certain 
measures will or will not be more effective instruments 
toward that attainment. So long as certain ends re- 
main unquestioned, it is relatively easy to evaluate the 
various proposed means for getting them. 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
    238 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
But supposing the question is raised, What kind of 
liberty and equality is best? Supposing the more ulti- 
mate ends in terms of which we are evaluating our 
means are themselves subjected to scrutiny? Supposing 
we ask the relative importance of liberty and authority 
in social activities, as we do in the chapter upon ethics, 
and endeavor to clarify just what we mean by liberty 
and by authority? It is when we attempt to make such 
an evaluation reflectively, and to get away from a purely 
irrational appeal to force or instinctive preference or per- 
haps mere blind chance, that we encounter the most 
serious obstacles of all. 
All of the difficulties we have seen in the endeavor to 
discover what are really purely objective facts in the 
field of human relationships are present, intensified a 
thousandfold when we seek the better and the worse. 
Such moral judgments are so bound up with the very 
characters of men that even to discuss them involves the 
risk of passionate misunderstanding. For it becomes a 
question of men’s ultimate preferences, those things 
which they hold to be most dear, and in the very nature 
of the case the frank and free doubting and discussion 
which are essential to the discovery of any sort of knowl- 
edge become well-nigh impossible. To convict a man 
of error in his aims and ideals, in his judgment of what is 
worth while, is far more than to convict him of an intel- 
lectual mistake; it is to brand him with moral obliquity 
and sin, to pass judgment upon the whole man. Who 
of us does not feel that the individual who differs with us 
upon the fundamental preferences, who refuses to ac- 
knowledge the sanctity of private property, or who sees 
no harm in the permanence of warfare — who does not 
feel that such a man is, indeed, beyond the pale? It is
-P-A-G-E-247
REFLECTION IN VALUES 239 
rare, indeed, that two men can engage in any discussion 
in which they find themselves differing thus radically 
without allowing the heat of passion to obscure the light 
of reason. To suggest even the need of criticizing and 
testing the commonly accepted standards of conduct is 
the surest way to incur the stigma of moral laxity. 
But even if the investigation can be kept upon a plane 
into which there enters no personal recrimination, the 
logical difficulties themselves are appalling. We have 
already called attention to the fact that the immediate 
value of any course of action — that quality it possesses 
of affording intrinsic satisfaction — must play a most 
important part in the complete picture of the effects fol- 
lowing upon it. But of all the consequences of an act, 
it is most difficult of all to foretell the amount of imme- 
diate satisfaction it will bring with it. Hard as it is to 
determine the total objective effects of, say, a single lie 
which a man tells to get himself out of a tight place, it is 
infinitely harder to predict the importance he will as- 
sign to the avoidance of that momentary embarrass- 
ment to-morrow morning or next week. It has been the 
advice of wise men from Plato down to endeavor so far 
as possible to escape from the immediate present and to 
look at our actsas they will appear to us amonth or a year 
hence. But the pleasure of the moment is strong, and 
the appeal of future good is notoriously weak. Video 
meliora proboque, deteriora sequor — what is this but the 
ery of humanity that immediate satisfaction, even 
though temporary and evanescent, outweighs more 
permanent good? The cynic who said, “There is but 
one thing in the world more terrible than not getting 
what you want, and that is getting it,” was a profound 
observer of human striving and aspiration. For the 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  240 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
gratification which the satisfaction of immediate de-’ 
sires will bring is the most unpredictable thing in the 
world, and nothing is more universal than for anticipa- 
ted pleasure to turn to dust and ashes when it is finally 
in one’s grasp. Just in so far as allowance is made for 
the respective satisfactions which it seems various goods 
will bring with them, an element is introduced into such 
deliberation about values which makes any strictly ob- 
jective calculation impossible. And yet not to take it 
into account would be the most irrational course of all. 
The only basis for giving to such pleasures their 
proper weight in the developed picture is that of actual 
and repeated experience with them. Only he who 
knows both the better and the worse can be a judge of 
which is the better; only he who has eaten of the fruit 
of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil can engage 
in moral deliberation. It is, for example, the inability of 
the average respectable morelist_ to comprehend the ap- 
peal which the worse course can make, as well as the 
better — it is his lack of a sympathetic acquaintance 
with all of the values entering into the problem — that 
makes the great mass of what ordinarily passes for 
moral guidance and exhortation quite worthless. But 
when a man can say, like Augustine, ‘‘I have tried both 
—I have dwelt amidst the flesh-pots of Egypt, and I 
have journeyed through the wilderness into the Prom- 
ised Land, and I tell you that all the delights of iniquity 
are as naught to the enduring worth of righteousness” 
— when a man has experienced both, he can speak as 
one possessing authority, and his words will be heark- 
ened to for generations. 
It may well happen that men disagree upon the ap- 
peal of various goods for lack of actual experience with 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
  
REFLECTION IN VALUES 241 
them. No one who had never heard a single symphony 
of Beethoven performed would be accepted as a compe- 
tent judge of the respective merits of Beethoven and 
Irving Berlin. We laugh at the Frenchman who tried 
to prove that Victor Hugo was a greater poet than 
Goethe, when we learn that he could not read a word of 
German. And yet not a day passes that we do not 
make ourselves some judgment of value upon an equally 
meager experience. To aman who is manifestly basing 
his opinion upon some such one-sided knowledge of the 
facts, we can only say, as Pascal said to the dissolute no- 
bility to whom he was trying to prove the worth and 
value of the Christian religion at its best, ‘“Tryit, taste of 
its fruits, and then decide whether human life is not the 
richer for it and the poorer without it.” 
John Stuart Mill well expresses this fact, that only he 
who has tasted the higher as well as the lower forms of 
satisfaction is a competent judge of which is the more ap- 
pealing, in a passage in his Utilitarianism that has be- 
come classic: 
Now it is an unquestionable fact that those who are equally 
acquainted with, and equally capable of appreciating and en- 
joying, both, do give a most marked preference to the manner 
of existence which employs their higher faculties. Few hu- 
man creatures would consent to be changed into any of the 
lower animals, for a promise of the fullest allowance of a 
beast’s pleasure; no intelligent human being would consent 
to be a fool, no instructed person would be an ignoramus, no 
person of feeling and conscience would be selfish and base, 
even though they should be persuaded that the dunce, the 
fool, or the rascal is better satisfied with his lot than they are 
with theirs. They would not resign what they possess more 
than he for the most complete satisfaction of all the desires 
which they have in common with him. . . . It is better to be a 
human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be
-P-A-G-E-250
  242 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or 
the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only 
know their own side of the question. The other party to the 
comparison knows both sides. 
In the last analysis, the final test of the relative worth 
of values must be experience, just as the final test of 
any truth must come down to an experienced agreement 
with fact. That is why in any process of evaluation 
there must be an initial agreement on some thing as 
good, on some standard as valid. Could the scientists 
not agree upon certain observed facts, there could be no 
science; could men not agree upon some standards, 
there could be no reflective choices of competing goods. 
Yet it still remains true that many men would disa- 
gree, even after a thorough experience of various values, 
as to the relative importance to be assigned to each in 
any ultimate standard of what constituted a good life. 
It often happens that the process of clarifying ends re- 
sults in a more marked disagreement than at the outset. 
Men who could fight together for the ideal of democracy 
might well quarrel with each other if they came to an- 
alyze precisely what they meant by that vague and gen- 
erous concept. Yet even if they finally came to blows 
themselves, they would know more clearly what they 
were fighting for, and that conflict would be fraught 
with a more genuine significance. The Northern and 
the Southern Colonies fought England twice in defense 
of their liberty; then for a generation their statesmen 
engaged in a process of clarifying just what they meant 
by that liberty. That led to the Civil War; but at least 
the liberty which was at stake in that conflict possessed 
aricher meaning than the vaguer liberty of the Revolu- 
41 Utilitarianism, chap. 11.
-P-A-G-E-251
  
REFLECTION IN VALUES 243 
tion. And, after all, both North and South did agree on 
most of the essential points, and the very fact of the 
final clarification on the field of battle has made possible 
a much fuller codperation since. The chapter on ethics 
is to deal with an issue in which all these points are 
brought out clearly. 
But this fact of what constitutes perhaps an ultimate 
disagreement on important preferences, which cannot be 
settled by an appeal to experience because experience 
differs from man to man, does lead to the most pro- 
found difficulty of all in any consideration of values. 
Judgments are assertions about matters of fact or 
about the relations of ideas; they are true or false, and if 
true for one, they are true for all. But preferences, it 
may be objected, are not true or false; they are personal 
traits; and, although a preference may be shared by 
many people, it is none the worse for being peculiar to 
one individual. Our judgments of value, it may be 
urged, are really nothing more than expressions of taste; 
and, if the proverb that there is no disputing about 
tastes is not quite an axiom, it can hardly be denied 
a large measure of truth. An argument can always be 
brought to an end if we agree to call the point in ques- 
tion ‘‘a matter of taste,” and though it would doubtless 
be a mistake to attach too much stress to a convention 
by which we are accustomed to avoid continuing a debate 
that has begun to seem unprofitable, we can hardly deny 
the fact any significance at all. A man who says that 
New York is more populous than London can be con- 
victed of error with a conclusiveness not to be hoped for 
if he says that the view of New York from the bay is 
more impressive, or less impressive, than the view of 
London from the Thames. Of the latter statement we  
-P-A-G-E-252
244 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
may say that it all depends on what you find impressive; 
one man may prefer mere bigness, another architectural 
harmony and the presence of historical associations, and 
who is to judge between them? If I prefer ripe olives to 
green olives, and you prefer green to ripe, neither of us, 
probably, is prepared to call the other wrong, though 
each may be convinced that his own taste is the more re- 
fined. If we differ on the relative merits of Aischylus and 
Shakespeare, there is more room for debate, and per- 
haps slightly more hope of agreement, but certainly we 
cannot expect a demonstrative conclusion on either side. 
Even if we take a judgment which seems to admit of no 
dispute, such as that Othello is a greater tragedy than 
The Easiest Way, proof seems impossible to find; more 
people will pay to see the latter, and to what quarter 
are we to look for an authoritative condemnation of 
their judgment? 
The same sort of criticism may be extended to moral 
judgments. The statement that murder is wrong seems 
to command assent almost as universal as that lead 
is heavier than water. We can, however, assent to a 
statement only when we know its meaning, and when 
we begin to examine the assertion that murder is wrong 
we find that it has no such unmistakable significance as 
the assertion about lead and water. The terms of the 
latter are absolutely specific, and within reasonable lim- 
its we can be quite sure when a substance is lead or 
water. To define ‘‘murder,”’ however, is by no means a 
simple affair. To kill a man is not murder unless it is 
done with malice aforethought and in the absence of 
justifying circumstances. Homicide in self-defense or 
in war is not generally regarded as unjustifiable, nor is a 
man a murderer when in anger he strikes a blow not in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
  REFLECTION IN VALUES 245 
tended to be fatal. We cannot, in other words, identify 
an act of homicide with murder until we have made sure 
cf a set of circumstances at least part of which, the 
frame of mind of the alleged murderer, is in the nature of 
the case uncertain., We have virtually prejudged an 
act as immoral in calling it murder, and the moral judg- 
ment that murder is immoral is to that extent tautolo- 
gous and not a true judgment at all. If this, probably 
the least doubtful of all moral judgments, thus turns out 
to be uncertain in its application, there seems to be little 
probability that any other of our precepts for conduct 
will stand on a firmer logical footing, and this we find 
upon examination to be the truth. Bribery, deception, 
theft, are all doubtless wrong. But these are vague 
terms: Is a man who to keep his position refrains from 
expressing unpopular opinions accepting his salary as a 
bribe for betraying the truth? Is he deceiving his em- 
ployer and securing money under false pretenses? We 
cannot answer these questions in the affirmative until we 
have decided in the light of all the circumstances that 
the act is wrong, and our alleged moral certainties turn 
out in consequence to be little more than statements that 
what is immoral is immoral. It can scarcely be main- 
tained that such judgments are of the same logical 
standing as the Pythagorean theorem or the law of 
gravitation. 
This conclusion about the validity of moral laws is 
enormously reinforced when we discover the variations 
in moral standards in time and place. We should con- 
sider nothing more outrageous than to burn a man alive 
rather than to permit him to differ with us on a matter 
of opinion. This, however, was regarded not so many 
centuries ago as not only a permissible method of con-
-P-A-G-E-254
  246 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
troversy, but also as a moral and religious duty if the 
controversy were about matters of serious importance. 
The moral skeptic is therefore led to generalize: to say 
that anything is wrong is to say that it displeases me, 
and to say no more. ‘‘Cruelty is immoral,” ‘‘Boast- 
ing is vulgar,” ‘“‘Way Down East’ is a bad play,” 
“Men should not use perfume,” and, ‘It is barbarous 
to put maple-syrup on lobster-salad,”’ are all, from the 
point of view of logic, indistinguishable. 
To these arguments of the complete moral skeptic, it 
must be admitted, there can be made no conclusive and 
irrefutable reply. But neither can any conclusive reply 
be made to the skeptic in any field, not even to the 
man who assails that vast edifice of observation and in- 
ference we call scientific truth. When all has been said 
in favor of skepticism, it remains clear that men must 
act, that some acts are better than others, and that some 
basis of discrimination must be used. The skeptic is 
right in maintaining that at some point all our knowl- 
edge, of sense-fact, of mathematical truth, of inference, 
of values, rests upon unproved assumptions. Yet it is ob- 
viously the part of reason to make these assumptions as 
fundamental as possible, to choose those that appear 
the least uncertain, and to introduce them only when re- 
flection has reached its limits. To maintain that, be- 
cause ultimately it is a matter of preference that wan- 
ton taking of human life is bad, we should slay the 
man next door, would be as foolish and impossible as to 
maintain that, because men lie and the senses deceive, 
every statement is as good and as true as any other. 
Nor is it by any means certain that disagreements 
are as absolute as the moral skeptic affirms. When men 
bave actually experienced several different goods, there
-P-A-G-E-255
  REFLECTION IN VALUES 247 
is generally fairly unanimous agreement about them. 
The South tried slavery, and it has tried emancipation; 
and the number of Southerners who would prefer to re- 
turn to slavery is certainly much fewer than the number 
who would reject, say, the ‘objectively established” 
theory of evolution. Before 1914 there were men who 
proclaimed war to be a good; but since we have experi- 
enced that state of affairs, such individuals, if there still 
be any, have preserved a pretty complete silence. 
No one who has ever tried to work out the solution to 
any complex problem of evaluation can ever be misled 
into thinking it an easy matter. No one who has ever 
been called upon to choose definitely between two com- 
plicated courses of action can feel confident that he has 
chosen rightly. For he will know that it is exceedingly 
difficult to foresee what consequences acts will have, 
that one can never be sure he has included all the rele- 
vant values in his picture of the future, and that the 
end which he has unquestioningly accepted may very 
possibly clash with other ends he would regard as of 
much greater importance. He will know that a most im- 
portant element of the future consequences of his choice, 
the satisfaction he will thereby attain for his immedi- 
ate desires and preferences, is something very largely 
eluding determination in advance, and that it is cer- 
tainly an element that varies with every man and every 
situation, and hence makes it virtually impossible to lay 
down any universal principles whose application is not 
tempered by a large consideration of the individual 
character involved. 
But while we may recognize that there is of necessity 
a very large irrational element in every judgment of 
value, an element that depends upon the constitution of 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  248 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
the man concerned, as well as upon the ultimate end or 
criterion which may or may not be able to stand up if it 
itself is submitted to test, nevertheless we should not let 
our keen realization of the limitations of reflection in 
dealing with the field of values prevent our endeavor to 
introduce it into such problems to the greatest degree of 
which we are capable. It may not be a large work that 
it can accomplish; compared with the success of reflec- 
tion in dealing with the much less difficult problems of 
natural science, it may well appear a feeble rushlight. 
But in the darkness and confusion in which we are wan- 
dering the tiniest match can furnish enough illumination 
to save us many a hard knock and disaster. 
Section 5. The Emergence of Standards and General 
Principles 
We have seen how the process of evaluation consists 
in testing out various suggested goods by the way in 
which they produce further desirable fruits. This does 
not mean, however, that in every particular case involv- 
ing values it is necessary to resort to this conscious re- 
flection, any more than it is necessary for the astrono- 
mer to prove the heliocentric theory every time he looks 
upon the stars. In the course of our experience of judg- 
ing the relative value of different goods, we build up 
certain moral principles, certain generalizations which 
will serve as criteria for further doubtful cases. To take 
our original illustration, we should probably decide to use 
the subway unless special considerations made the bus 
more attractive; having decided which shall have the 
priority, if need be, we develop a set of rules we can ap- 
ply without too great expenditure of time and energy. 
Neither do we have to deliberate when passing a fruit-
-P-A-G-E-257
REFLECTION IN VALUES 249 
stand whether it is better to steal or to buy the fruit; we 
have learned that stealing is bad, and that principle re- 
mains for us unquestioned. In all the practical exigen- 
cies of life these principles remain given, the points of 
reference by which all doubtful cases can be decided; in 
a sense so far as that problem is concerned, they are ac- 
cepted as absolute. As such they facilitate immensely 
the solution of difficulties, summing up as they do large 
bodies of experience, classifying our values under gen- 
eral heads. We should be as helpless without them as 
would the scientist without his accumulated and classi- 
fied body of established beliefs on which to rely. And 
yet there is a very real danger that these general prin- 
ciples, important and useful as they are if they are 
rightly regarded as summations of past experience, may 
come to be looked upon as fixed and unalterable, not 
themselves amenable to further testing. They may be 
removed entirely from the field to which reflection is ap- 
plied, and become the fixed dogmas of the orthodox 
moralist. 
As John Dewey so well puts it: 
Morals must be a growing science if it is to be a science at 
all, not merely because all truth has not yet been appropri- 
ated by the mind of man, but because life is a moving affair in 
which old moral truth ceases to apply. . . . Principles exist as 
hypotheses with which to experiment. Human history is long. 
There is a long record of past experimentation in conduct, 
and there are cumulative verifications which give many prin- 
ciples a well-earned prestige. Lightly to disregard them is 
the height of foolishness. But social situations alter; and it 
is also foolish not to observe how old principles actually work 
under new conditions, and not to modify them so that they 
will be more effectual instruments in judging new cases. 
Many men are now aware of the harm done in legal matters 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  250 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
by assuming the antecedent existence of fixed principles un- 
der which every new case may be brought. They recognize 
that this assumption merely puts a premium on ideas devel- 
oped under by-gone conditions, and that their perpetuation 
in the present works iniquity. Yet the choice is not between 
throwing away rules previously developed and sticking ob- 
stinately by them. The intelligent alternative is to revise, 
adapt, expand, and alter them. The problem is one of con- 
tinuous, vital readaptation.' 
This adaptive process, the continuous application of 
principles to particular cases and the accompanying re- 
vision of those principles, so important in every branch 
of human relationships, is the especial subject of the 
chapter upon the law that is to follow. Therein will be 
considered the problems that arise in the application of 
such general maxims as have been developed in the 
course of centuries and enshrined in the body of our law. 
They form a group of standards which, taken collec- 
tively, comprise the very essence of our civilization. 
They are the principles which have emerged through 
long experience. The lawyers have developed a most 
interesting technique for applying those general prin- 
ciples which are accepted by the public opinion of the 
country and embodied in its legal system, to the 
many particular cases of competing values which are 
brought before them for judgment. Of course, such 
general rules must be modified to fit each particular 
case and each particular problem; and how this is done 
we shall endeavor to ascertain. 
In summary, then, the field of values presents great 
difficulties, not only in the meager knowledge we can ac- 
tually obtain about the functioning of the factors in hu- 
man relationships, but even more in the arriving at pro-

visional standards by which any courses of action may 
be judged. The most promising method for reflection 
to follow is to elaborate suggestions until there does 
emerge some further standard by which they can be 
judged; and then, applying what knowledge is at our 
disposal, to try to evaluate our conflicting courses of ac- 
tion in the light of the consequences that appear to flow 
from them.

CHAPTER X 
MEASUREMENTS FOR USE IN SOCIAL DECISIONS 
Section 1. Two Ways of Choosing a Career 
Many persons are consciously anxious to choose a ca- 
reer in which they will be happy and successful. They 
would like so to live that they would find personal satis- 
faction and give to society the benefit of whatever tal- 
ents they possess. Frequently such anxiety is not felt 
by the persons directly concerned, but is keenly present 
in the minds of their parents or advisers, or in the de- 
sires of statesmen to know how a community or a na- 
tion may help its citizens to make the best use of them- 
selves and to contribute most to the common good. 
When, however, we consider the reasons which lie 
back of the advice given to a boy on his life plans we 
find very frequently that desire to raise the family 
prestige, the father’s estimate of the monetary returns 
of the prospective career, the mother’s fondness for an 
uncle who followed that calling, the ease of preparation 
for that vocation, the feeling that ‘‘this kind of job is as 
good as any other,” and dozens of similar guesses and 
whimsies are the sole bases for a decision. In business, 
when men are selected for different positions, ‘‘systems”’ 
of an equally inexact character are often followed. 
Some firms will have only blond salesmen, others only 
men with dark complexions, some tall men, some men 
with sharp noses.!_ To use such methods of vocational

  254 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
choice or of placement is to abandon reason completely: 
and to disregard our need for exact knowledge in matters 
requiring a well-founded belief. 
It is clear that we need more than exact knowledge in 
order to decide on a career. Some, unhappily many, 
persons are so poor in this world’s goods that they can- 
not follow the course of life which would mean most to 
them and to society. Such poverty may not prevent a 
person of the very highest natural or native ability, ca- 
pacity, or endowment from reaching his goal, but it is 
undoubtedly a barrier which many cannot surmount. 
Suppose that we consider, however, a boy whose par- 
ents are able to provide all needed advantages. What 
would he and they need to know? First, a great deal 
more information than we now possess about the exact 
requirements of the different careers open tomen. We 
might call such information “career specifications.” 
These would include a great variety of items of varying 
specificity, but they would in most cases include at least 
indications of the requirements in intelligence, ability to 
get on with other men, ability to take responsibility, and 
the advancement and income which might be expected. 
Next we should have to know whether the boy had 
abilities to match the ‘‘career specifications.” Such 
knowledge would be hard to get. Obviously the imma- 
ture boy might not have all of these abilities, yet per- 
haps he would develop them by the time they should be 
required. We should need to be able to measure pres- 
ent ability, and to predict future ability. If we could 
secure precise ‘‘career specifications,’ measurements of 
present ability, and predictions based on ability at 
present possessed, we should be able to approximate a 
reasoned decision.
-P-A-G-E-263
  
MEASUREMENT AND INQUIRY 255 
Section 2. Individual Differences 1 
There are many questions raised by the last sentence 
of the previous section. One may be: How do we know 
that abilities differ so greatly in individuals that so care- 
ful an analysis as is proposed will be significant? Dur- 
ing the last sixty years psychology has been at work en- 
deavoring to find out whether individuals differ in capac- 
ities, those potentialities with which they come into the 
world. Such potentialities we may call native; they 
cannot be created by nurture of any kind, though they 
may remain undeveloped because nurture is lacking. 
To-day practically all psychologists believe that there 
are native differences, and that there is a wide range in 
the possession of those human traits which no artificial 
development can bring forth. Psychologists do not 
agree on the accuracy of our present measures of these 
abilities, nor on the exact analysis of these traits into 
their separate parts, as, for instance, into intelligence, 
aggressiveness, courage, etc. 
All would admit that it is possible to determine how 
well each person in a group of four hundred does a par- 
ticular task, and nearly all would say that such tasks may 
be set as will reveal native ability and be at least some 
indication of future development. One of the most 
striking examples of the range of accomplishment known 
is the record of testing in the army. The chart on page 
256 shows us grades made by men in a wide range of 
occupations when they took a standard test which was 
interpreted as a measure of mental alertness, of so-called 
intelligence. 
Men vary widely also in traits which we call moral 
. } See Chapter 1, Section 3.

— honesty, courage, dependability, and so on—and 
they show a wide range of ability in manual dexterity 
and in sensitiveness to things of beauty. 
Another question which may be asked is whether an 
individual shows the same dominant ability and the same 
amount of it, relative to the amount shown by his fel- 
lows, throughout his life. That is: Do the traits discern- 
ible in a boy of ten appear in the same relationship in a 
man of thirty. To this we must answer that we do 
not know surely, but ‘‘all the experiments to date tend 
to prove that the relative mental capacity of the child 
determines his relative mental capacity as an adult.” + 
Section 8. Some Requirements of Measures 
The assertions which have just been made rest on in- 
vestigation and experiment. Psychologists have studied 
human behavior and have tried to use the same caution 
as other scientists and to reach the same kind of quanti- 
tative basis as has advanced scientific study in other 
fields. The determination of quantities has been the 
method of testing out the suggestions which have arisen 
as hypotheses and, as is so generally the case, the attain- 
ment of exact data has given rise to new theories. 
To say that measures are used to determine quantities 
is to say what every one admits. All will agree, too, that 
when one knows “‘how much,” one is able to carry on 
comparisons. Not every one, however, realizes the dif- 
ficulties involved in the use of measures as aids to well- 
founded beliefs. It is worth while, therefore, to state 
some of the elements essential to measurement. First 
of all, if we want to compare quantities, we must have a 
1C, S. Yoakum, “Basic Experiments in Vocational Guidance,” 
Journal of Personnel Research, vol. 1, no. 1, May, 1922. 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
258 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
numerical basis; we must count and have ten of a, and 
five of a, and three of a, and so on. When we want te 
measure intellectual ability, we devise a task and set 
every one about this same task in which degrees of suc- 
cess must be expressed in figures. This raises a second 
point: We measure indirectly. When we measure in- 
telligence, we are really counting scores; as when we 
measure temperature, we are measuring the height of a 
mercury column in a tube. We must always define what 
we are directly measuring and then define the thing for 
which it stands. A third point is that we must have con- 
stant units agreed upon (by convention) which are qual- 
itatively alike, so that they can be added and otherwise 
handled quantitatively. The unit of the Fahrenheit 
scale is one one-hundred-and-eightieth part of the dif- 
ference in the height of a column of mercury as it rises 
in water from freezing to boiling, but for the Centigrade 
scale it is one one-hundredth of that distance. Fourth, 
in making measurements there must be some point of 
reference agreed upon by convention just as the units 
are. In measuring temperature, for instance, the point 
of reference for Fahrenheit is thirty-two degrees below 
freezing, while for Centigrade it is the freezing point 
itself. When all these conditions are met, it is possible . 
to say, for example, that in this instance measured there 
are ten units with x taken asthe point of reference in 
the count, while in that instance measured there are 
eight units with x the point of reference. With such 
knowledge exact comparisons can be made. 
Section 4. Putting Measurements into Relation 
In the chapter on experimental methods we saw that 
one of the methods was called concomitant variations.
-P-A-G-E-267
  MEASUREMENT AND INQUIRY 259 
It could be employed when two factors varied in a con- 
stant relationship. Now, in making measurements we are 
often interested in being able to tell from one measure- 
ment made what we may expect concerning other ele- 
ments which have not in that particular instance been 
subjected to measurement. Such referential knowledge 
cannot be based on guess, but must rest on previous in- 
vestigations where many instances in which quality A is 
measured have been examined also for the quantitative 
amounts of quality B. Suppose, for instance that we 
have a group of 100 with a college entrance score of 125. 
We then find out how many of these finish the Fresh- 
man year without failing a course. Perhaps 95 mem- 
bers of the group turn out to have passed all the courses. 
To get greater accuracy, suppose we increase the count 
and discover that, in a thousand cases of men receiving 
125 as entrance score, 930 pass all Freshman work. We 
should then feel justified in saying that we have estab- 
lished a relationship between an entrance score of 125 
and success in Freshman studies. If, then, we wanted to 
make reasonably sure that 93 out of 100 men admitted 
to college would pass, we should insist that they all have 
scores of 125. In other words, by knowing the score 
125, we could predict that another element would be in 
co-relation; namely, success in Freshman courses. Stat- 
isticians, working in education or in economics or in 
health departments, or in any of the sciences where the 
knowledge of relationships and their predictability is es- 
sential, have reduced the expression of correlation to a 
numerical statement. If one element always varies di- 
rectly as the other, this perfect positive correlation is ex- 
pressed by saying that the coefficient of correlation is 1. 
_ If one element always varies inversely as the other, this 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
  
  260 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
perfect inverse correlation gives a coefficient of correla- 
tion of -1. If the variations in one element bear no re- 
lation, direct or inverse, to those of the other, this lack 
of relationship is signified by a coefficient of correlation 
of o. Correlation is an excellent example of the truth 
brought out in Chapter II that to include a thing in a 
class carries with it the implications of that class. 
Section 6. The Application of Measurement to an 
Individual Case 
Let us now look back at the case of the boy seeking ad- 
vice as to his career. If he should think he wanted to be 
an engineer, and as a Freshman in college was taking 
calculus and physics and passing well, we might say to 
him that out of 100 men who passed these subjects 85 
graduated in the minimum time from their engineering 
course. Such an approach to accuracy we could attain. 
This information would not tell the student anything 
in quantitative terms about the likelihood of success in 
actual engineering practice. We should notice, more- 
over, that we still could not tell him that he would 
be one of the 85. Such statistical treatments deal with 
groups, and do not predict as to specified individual 
members of a group. But suppose we knew more about 
engineering and found that there were among other 
types designing engineers, operating engineers, and 
salesmen engineers. We should want to find out success 
correlations with the student’s subjects and each type. 
Did we aim at the maximum advice, we should want to 
know in the greatest detail all the duties of the kind of 
engineering he proposed to enter, and also the qualities 
of mind and character (including desires) which the 
work demanded. We should need to study each type of
-P-A-G-E-269
  MEASUREMENT AND INQUIRY 261 
engineering very carefully and, from the analysis of the 
qualities in a large number of successful engineers in a 
defined kind of work, determine the traits most con- 
stantly associated with success in its various ranges. 
These we should express in quantitative terms. We 
should then want to determine again in quantitative 
terms his possession of these qualities. We might then 
be able to tell him into what group, with a specified cor- 
relation with success (externally and personally satis- 
factory), he would fall. It is unnecessary to say that we 
are far, far removed from such an ability to predict. 
But we are, nevertheless, able to point out lines of prob- 
able failure and success with a certainty which is of an 
altogether and completely different sort than could be 
claimed by him who chose his salesmen by the color of 
their hair, or advised his son to go into a profession be- 
cause of its financial return. 
Section 6. The Social Utility of Measurements 
If the student whom we have considered had been 
well advised and he had entered a profession in which he 
would have gained happiness and success and had 
helped effectively to carry on the work of the world, we 
should have been using exact information to some pur- 
pose. We should have been discovering a causal pat- 
tern in social phenomena, as Chapter IX put it. 
There is opportunity in education for the use of exact 
measures on a scale so great as to dwarf any individual 
instances. When the measuring of individual differ- 
ences in ability and interest finally reaches a complete- 
ness and accuracy now only dreamed of, we shall doubt- 
less be able to direct students into a wide variety of 
types of education rather than send them through one
-P-A-G-E-270
262 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
stereotyped curriculum. We shall be able to advise, 
furthermore, as to the probable profit of continuing the 
education beyond a certain point, for we shall be able to 
tell with considerable accuracy how much a person with 
a specified amount of ability may hope to gain from con- 
tinued study in a certain line. 
The application of exact measurements to the accom- 
plishment of students is important for school systems, as 
well as for individuals, for, when we know how much 
students of x ability do in School A, we can compare the 
effectiveness of School B which is also training students 
of x ability. In this fashion, school administration is 
given some tangible basis for the criticism of its stand- 
ards. 
In the study of various political mechanisms, as, for 
instance, the referendum, success can within limits be 
studied quantitatively; and in economics the equation of 
wage and the cost of living is an excellent example of the 
quantitative treatment of a public problem of the great- 
est importance. Insurance is another instance of the 
practical application of the statistical method or the de- 
termination of probabilities for groups. Statistics have, 
indeed, been advanced partly because of their utility in 
the insurance field. 
In all of these applications of a quantitative method 
what we are doing is making increasingly clear the ac- 
tual situation with which we are dealing. We are mak- 
ing a more exact observation and classification possible. 
The difficulties of such quantitative treatment in the 
field of human life, with its great variability, its rapid 
changes and its responsiveness to a tremendously com- 
plex multiplicity of stimuli from within and without, far 
exceed the limitations under which quantitative meas-
-P-A-G-E-271
  MEASUREMENT AND INQUIRY 263 
ures in the field of physics suffer. But the advantages 
of exact knowledge in individual and social decisions are 
readily appreciated, and the statement of Chapter I, that 
we need human engineers, may now, perhaps, be better 
understood. 
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
1. a. If some one should question the effectiveness of the referendum 
as a means of finding out public opinion, why would an advan- 
tage in determining the validity of the question be gained by a 
study of the vote on measures referred for public expression of 
acceptance or rejection? 
b. What kinds of information should such a study seek? 
c. What would be the end which referendum would serve, and under 
what circumstances would it be considered an effective means? 
2. On the basis of what findings through exact measures would it be 
desirable, when financially possible: 
a. To establish high schools of widely different curricula? 
b. To establish schools for the mentally retarded and mentally pre- 
cocious? 
3. How could physical fatigue be measured exactly? Show why such 
measurement might be valuable for law makers, safety engineers, 
production managers in business. 
4. a. In the mobilizing of an army from private citizens, why would a 
knowledge of the mental ability and of the kind and degree of 
trade craft or professional skill be important? 
b. How would you go about testing degrees of skill in telegraph op- 
erators? 
5. If you were a manufacturer of cotton dress goods, and wanted to 
know what color in gingham to manufacture, what steps would 
you take to find out the answer to your problem?

CHAPTER XI 
REFLECTIVE THINKING IN LAW 
Section 1. The Non-Reflective Growth of Law 
Tue institution and practice of law, like all other institu- 
tions, is only in part a reflective process. It has its ori- 
gins in the most primitive and unconscious forms of hu- 
man behavior and social organization. Mankind, in its 
blind gropings, in the half-conscious process of feeling its 
way out of primitive brutishness, had created unwritten 
laws and was governing itself according to them long 
before it became aware of the fact. Indeed, so closely 
inwoven into the fabric of social life are these rules and 
customs that those who first reflected upon them natu- 
rally attributed them to the Creator himself or to what- 
ever forces were supposed to control human life and des- 
tiny. Even long after it had ceased to be intellectually 
fashionable to attribute these laws to the designing will 
of some superhuman spirit, men still regarded them as 
part of the universal framework of nature, calling them 
“Jaws of nature.” According to this theory human so- 
ciety is supposed to be under the government of laws 
not of its own making, and therefore not of its own 
unmaking; laws similar to the “‘natural laws” of which 
the scientists speak, which are as immutable and eternal 
as Nature herself. 
But as knowledge of human history and of human na- 
ture advanced, men became conscious of the fact that 
“these laws are man-made and self-imposed, that they 
were a long time in forming, and that the forces of habit
-P-A-G-E-274
    266 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
and gregariousness operating for the most part uncon- 
sciously had succeeded in moulding society into more or 
less stable patterns, whose guiding principles could be 
discovered and formulated. With this insight attained, 
the imagination of man was liberated and given con- 
structive power. Once man discovers that he has been 
blindly and unconsciously shaping laws and customs, 
he is enabled to proceed consciously or reflectively. He 
becomes aware of his own responsibility and undertakes 
the process with foresight. Thus the intelligent use and 
control of laws becomes possible, and the making and 
practice of law becomes a chapter in the social organiza- 
tion of reflective thinking. 
ITS IMPORTANCE FOR REFLECTIVE LAW 
Though the operation of legal codes is now for the 
most part a highly organized system of reflective think- 
ing, it cannot be understood unless its non-reflective ori- 
gins are kept in mind. Underlying the processes of leg- 
islation and judicial decision, which are or ought to be 
reflective, there are principles and precedents which 
come from nobody knows where, and there are others 
whose origins are known, but known to be much earlier 
than the invention of modern systems of legislation and 
jurisprudence. Conscious legislation, in fact, would be 
almost a superhuman task were it not for this great body 
of recognized modes of procedure which centuries of ex- 
perience have established, and which can be reformed 
and reformulated, but cannot be abolished. The con- 
scious art of legislation never begins with a clean slate, 
so to speak; it cannot create a social order; it can but 
redirect a social order already in operation. Intelli- 
gence in the legal sphere, as in all spheres of human ac-

tivity, is forced to work with material not of its own mak- 
ing; and it is creative only when it makes the best of the 
material in hand, instead of wandering about in search 
of material more to its liking. More specifically this 
implies that the law, in so far as it is a system of reflec- 
tive thinking, is a continuous attempt to apply approved 
and established modes of conduct to new and uncertain 
situations in such a manner as to insure their mutual re- 
inforcement. Reflective law must avoid both of two 
extremes: if it merely follows the established traditions, 
it loses its value, for it ceases to be reflective; if it ig- 
nores the established traditions and attempts to con- 
struct a social order of its own based on “reason” alone, 
it loses its applicability, for its orderliness is dialectical 
instead of social. Reflective thinking in law is chiefly 
concerned with finding the proper mean between these 
extremes. Bacon’s famous dictum is nowhere so im- 
portant as in law: “the wit and mind of man, if it work 
upon matter, ...worketh according to the stuff and is 
limited thereby; but if it work upon itself, as the spider 
worketh his web, then it is endless, and brings forth in- 
deed cobwebs of learning, admirable for the fineness of 
thread and work, but of no substance or profit.” + 
A statute or a decision to be effective, must be gener- 
ally consistent with traditional principles: it must con- 
form to the general force of custom and to ‘‘the spirit of 
the common law” sufficiently to be capable of assimila- 
tion. The customary penalties and sanctions, the es- 
tablished modes of enforcement, and the general ap- 
proval or disapproval of public sentiment are factors 
which no legislator can disregard. Within certain lim- 
its these stabilizing forces, often operating uncon- 
1 Advancement of Learning, 1.
-P-A-G-E-276
  268 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
sciously, are sufficient to ‘‘make or break” alaw. Any 
legislation which is content to ignore these forces, or 
even to scorn them as irrational, is certain to find the 
tables turned: it will find itself isolated, ineffectual, and 
to that extent irrational. This does not mean that leg- 
islation must slavishly follow custom, which would be 
anything but reflective procedure; but it does mean that 
legislation must be willing to work upon custom, and in 
general conformity with established practices and moral 
sentiments, instead of attempting to operate on an a 
priort basis, be it ever so “logical.” 
A second important limiting factor in reflective legis- 
lation is the fact that legislation, since it is of necessity 
general or universal, and since it deals with social facts 
that are continually changing and thus rendering old 
generalizations more or less ambiguous, can define its 
object with only a very limited degree of accuracy. If 
each situation could be dealt with on its own merits, if it 
were a “law unto itself,” legal thinking would be logi- 
cally simpler and might be more intelligent; but then we 
should not have laws. For the whole purpose and es- 
sence of law is to enable us to deal with particular issues 
as particular examples of a general type or class. In- 
telligent control would be out of the question, were it not 
possible to discover general types and to deal with them 
assuch. But such general types can be formulated only 
within limits. To begin with, social institutions and 
problems cannot be classified with mathematical preci- 
sion; and even if they could, they change so continually, 
and, in modern society especially, so radically, that, 
even with the utmost care in defining the scope of a law, 
ambiguities creep in almost immediately and usually 
grow worse as time passes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
THINKING IN LAW 269 
And here we come upon a fundamental difference be- 
tween the logic of the natural and of the moral sciences. 
The “laws” which the natural scientist discovers have 
little in common, save the name, with laws in the legal 
sense. A scientific “law,’’ being merely a descriptive for- 
mulaof the behavior of natural objects which can beaccu- 
rately and mathematically described and calculated, is 
immediately applicable as long as these objects behave 
asthey do. The ‘‘application”’ of physical laws conse- 
quently requires chiefly technical skill in working with 
ready-made formule. But human laws are seldom 
capable of such accurate formulation, nor are the condi- 
tions under which they operate so constant. Natural 
laws have no power to govern, nor do they make Nature 
more orderly than she happens to be. But human laws, 
in so far as they operate at all, actually do govern; and 
they govern not merely in that they are prescriptions of 
what men should do rather than descriptions of what 
they actually do, they govern in the sense that they be- 
come guiding principles for the handling of new situa- 
tions, modes of controlling what would otherwise be 
“chaotic” and unintelligible. Indeterminate cases are 
determined by them; new situations are “brought 
under” them. If every situation had one law, and that 
obviously its law, the legal profession would be more 
like a card index and less like a science. If in medicine 
each symptom meant a definite disease, and each dis- 
ease had a single cure, we might have automatic me- 
chanical physicians. But as it is, the lawyer, like the 
physician, is forced to make diagnoses, to select proper 
remedies and to use his judgment. It is this problem of 
discovering how law can be applied to an uncertain case 
that makes the reasoning of the lawyer both so intricate 
and so useful.
-P-A-G-E-278
  270 ‘REFLECTIVE THINKING 
Hence one of the most serious problems for law is the 
problem of the classification and definition of particulars 
by means of group concepts. If the concepts are too in- 
clusive, the law will be applied where it was not in- 
tended to apply, resulting in stupidity and injustice; if 
the concepts are too exclusive, the law will be interpreted 
as inapplicable and consequently become ineffectual. 
For example, if all promises were legally obligatory, 
much injustice would be done; if, on the other hand, the 
conditions under which contracts are legally obligatory 
are too narrowly drawn, men will avoid making con- 
tracts, and the law becomes ineffectual. The law must 
“draw the lines,” but to draw them clearly and suitably 
is a difficult task. Many a law is side-tracked because, 
if “construed strictly,” it makes unfair discriminations, 
and, if ‘“‘construed loosely,” it includes too many cases 
to be enforcible. Such dangers legislators and judges 
must continually keep in mind. , 
Section 2. The Legal “‘ Act of Thought” 
The whole legal process, from the first agitation for a 
certain line of legislation or judicial decision to the final 
assimilation or rejection of the statute (or decision, as 
the case may be) in the established body of the law of 
the land, is really a single act of reflective thought, 
though it take several decades or centuries to complete 
it. In fact, the field of law gives us one of the best illus- 
trations of the vast amount of social organization and 
coéperation necessary for the carrying on of systematic 
thinking. Legislatures, with their numerous commit- 
tees, bureaus and boards, lawyers, judges, courts, detec- 
tive agencies, investigating commissions, to say nothing 
of all the associations for the promotion of various types
-P-A-G-E-279
THINKING IN LAW a71 
of legislation, are, or at least ought to be, so much social 
machinery for reflective thinking in law. Thinking 
machinery is probably the most intricate machinery 
there is. All we can hope to do in this chapter is to out- 
line the chief steps in the process, and then to describe a 
concrete case which illustrates some of the more impor- 
tant of those steps. 
The process falls into two main divisions: (1) the 
making of laws, (2) their testing or application. 
THE REFLECTIVE MAKING OF LAWS 
The two conditions discussed above, the power of cus- 
tom and the need for controlling particular events by 
general rules, furnish the setting and fix the problem for 
reflective legislation. The first raises the problem of 
finding effective means of enforcing a law — the prob- 
lem of ‘‘sanctions”’; the second raises the problem of de- 
fining the scope and purpose of a law. The difference 
between a genuinely reflective and a superficial making 
of laws lies in the amount of care and thoroughness with 
which these problems are faced. 
Hence the care with which the problems are analyzed 
and the precision with which laws are formulated. 
Hence the numerous hearings before committees on 
proposed bills, the submitting and resubmitting, until 
the scope of the bill has been defined sufficiently. The 
various drafts of a bill may be defined as so many hypoth- 
eses, each of which has to be tested until one is finally 
accepted. When, after all this analysis and experimen- 
tation with rival “hypotheses,” a bill finally passes and 
becomes a law, we are apt to regard that as the termina- 
tion of the reflective process. We regard the measure as 
finally validated, verified, accepted, and the problem as  
-P-A-G-E-280
  272 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
solved. In some cases this is no doubt true. Some 
laws are put into practice readily, work smoothly, no 
questions are asked, and the matter may be regarded as 
“settled”; and a few others immediately pass into obliv- 
ion, are never applied, and become “‘dead letters.” But 
in the great majority of cases the process of verification 
merely begins with the enactment of a law. The prob- 
lem merely “changes hands”’; it passes out of the juris- 
diction of the legislator and into that of the lawyer and 
judge. Here fresh difficulties arise, for here the prac- 
tical testing begins. The lawyers, not the legislators, 
have the task of applying the law, and usually in the 
course of this task unforeseen problems arise. The real 
“making of laws” is continued by the judge after the 
legislator has finished with them; and the judge’s deci- 
sions are subject to the same dangers and difficulties, 
when they in turn become law. 
It might be that reflective thinking in law would be 
more efficient if the process were not so rudely inter- 
rupted by a change of hands. Much valuable experi- 
ence might be capitalized which is now lost, if, as is the 
case in the common law, those who make laws were also 
responsible for their application. Be that as it may, the 
fact is that there is this general division of labor in legal 
thinking. The result is that the courts, even in addition 
to the common law, which is mostly court made, actu- 
aily ‘“make” more law than the legislature. For, in 
spite of the painstaking analysis of the legislators, or 
more frequently because of lack of it, the lawyer soon 
discovers ambiguities in the application of a law or con- 
flicts between one law and another which call for a 
decision. These decisions, which are made by judges, 
really are but a further definition and systematization
-P-A-G-E-281
THINKING IN LAW 273 
of laws whose meaning and application were left am- 
biguous by the legislators, and they operate in much the 
same way that the original laws do. They form a body 
of ‘interpretations’ which are used as precedents. Ifa 
legal case is seen to be in one or more respects identical 
with a previous case, the decision of the previous court 
is cited as precedent. Law could, of course, make little 
progress if the same problem had to be argued afresh 
each time it arose, instead of taking the decisions arrived 
at as precedents. Precedents may be called in question 
if for any cause the reasoning which supports them is 
thought to be fallacious; but otherwise they are simply 
accepted as authoritative opinions. The only problem 
which arises in such situations is whether or not the 
present case and the case on which the precedent rests 
are really identical; and this is usually not so easy to de- 
termine as one might suppose, so that sometimes it hap- 
pens that the use of precedent raises more problems 
than it avoids. But on the whole, the use of precedents 
is not only a convenience, but an absolute necessity, for 
it is manifestly impossible to argue the validity of a 
whole legal system every time a legal case arises. In 
any argument there must be some things taken for 
granted. 
The judges, as interpreters of law, may or may not 
coéperate with the original legislators. They probably 
have their own ideas about what the law should be, and 
their interpretation of what the law 7s is consciously or 
unconsciously influenced by these ideas. This is espe- 
cially true when party issues and tactics enter into the 
situation. The consequences of the ‘‘change of hands” 
in legal thinking become most obvious in constitutional 
law; for constitutions are of necessity most vague and
-P-A-G-E-282
  274 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
general, and judicial “‘interpretations”’ of them are con- 
sequently most vital. 
So far we have spoken of laws as originating in legisla- 
tures and as being perfected (or perverted, as the case 
may be) by the courts. But only one half of the 
law, and, historically speaking, the less significant half, 
originates in the legislature. In most countries courts 
were in existence long before legislatures, and, even in 
those cases where they were established simultaneously, 
the courts recognize the validity of a body of procedure 
which arose independently of the statute law of the 
land. This is known as the “common law.” Its sources 
vary in different countries. In the United States it 
is based largely on the body of custom which was 
recognized by English courts, on precedents estab- 
lished by English courts, and to a much lesser extent 
on feudal law, laws of the Puritan congregations, etc. 
Many of the laws still in operation have their origin in 
the customs of English merchants which came to be 
known as ‘‘the law merchant” and which was bodily 
incorporated into the English common law. Some 
laws even go back to a Roman household, or a medieval 
ecclesiastical order, or the decisions of a feudal baron. 
Some of the elements in these sources are non-reflective, 
resting as they do on mere custom or tradition; others 
are just as reflective as any statute of a legislature. But 
whether they be reflective in origin or not, they are re- 
flective in their operation to-day. Cases continually 
arise which involve no statute and which are therefore 
decided on the basis of the common law. But the com- 
mon law, especially when it rests on ancient procedures, 
is indefinite in its application, even more so than statute 
law, and must be “‘interpreted’’ and adapted to modern
-P-A-G-E-283
THINKING IN LAW 275 
social conditions. The common law is thus being con- 
tinually redefined, clarified, and extended. This growth 
of the common law, in so far as it is deliberate, is a proc- 
ess of lawmaking coérdinate with legislation in the nar- 
rower sense. The judge both makes and ‘‘applies” 
laws. This fact makes the “‘judicial process” and the 
legal profession a much more complicated affair than it 
would be if all law were statute law, but, logically speak- 
ing, the reflective thinking involved in the making of the 
common law is quite the same as that involved in the 
making of statute law, so that the analysis of legislation 
made above is to be understood as applying to ‘‘judge- 
made” laws as well as to the enactments of legislatures. 
We have begun our analysis of the “legal act of 
thought” with the legislature rather than the courts be- 
cause it is a social instrument or institution devised 
specifically for the purpose of reflective lawmaking, 
whereas the lawmaking function of the courts, at least 
of modern courts, is a secondary or acquired function, the 
prime purpose of the courts being to administer or apply 
the law. But legal theorists have been traditionally 
divided into two groups, those who think that all law 
ought to be statute law, in order that legal practice may 
be held continually responsible to the particular social 
facts and problems which the legislator has in mind, and 
those who think that all law ought to be common law, 
in order that it may form a consistent body of universal 
rules of procedure. 
The law with which the lawyer is required to deal is 
thus made up of distinct systems, each of which has 
its own origins and field of operations. We have dis- 
tinguished three such systems: (1) the common law, 
(2) statutes, (3) judicial “interpretations” of statutes, 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  276 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
which tend to become incorporated into the common 
law. With this brief analysis of the making of laws, we 
pass to the second phase of the legal “‘act of thought,” 
the application or practical testing of laws; the first is 
the inductive phase, the formation of a general rule to 
meet the demands made by certain particular situa- 
tions; the second is the deductive phase, the application 
of this general rule to other situations which test its 
validity. 
THE REFLECTIVE APPLICATION OF THE LAW 
From the foregoing it is evident that when the lawyer 
and judge ask the question, ‘What zs the law in this 
case?”’ the answer is usually not found by merely look- 
ing it up in the index, as it were; it requires genuine re- 
flective thinking. Of course, there are always cases 
brought to a lawyer for which ‘looking it up” in the 
precedents suffices. Where the law is explicit and prec- 
edent unequivocal, the solution of the problem is com- 
paratively simple as in the eviction of a tenant for non- 
payment of rent. In such cases the lawyer may be re- 
garded as a skilled mechanic rather than as a reflective 
thinker: he merely applies the legal machinery which 
automatically solves the case. The practice of law is in 
such cases purely deductive, and the reasoning involved 
differs in subject-matter only, and not in form, from 
that involved in a geometrical demonstration or proof. 
This involves thinking, to be sure, but, as this type of 
thinking has been analyzed in previous chapters, we 
pass on to more distinctively legal thinking. 
The distinctively reflective side of the legal profession 
comes out in those more important cases where prece- 
dents conflict, where terms are ambiguous, where social
-P-A-G-E-285
  THINKING IN LAW art 
facts have changed so as to render doubtful the applica- 
bility of the law, and in general where the law does not 
automatically apply itself. There are four general 
types of problems which confront the lawyer as he tries 
to apply the law as it is. The first is the problem of de- 
fining and clarifying the exact meaning and application 
of the law. The factors which underlie this problem 
have been discussed above when we were considering 
some fundamental difficulties in legal thinking, namely, 
the confused and changing social facts which law at- 
tempts to regulate, the consequent difficulties of precise 
definition and classification, the inability of legislators 
to foresee all the ambiguities which will arise in the oper- 
ation of alaw, etc. The lawyer avails himself of all pos- 
sible means in meeting this problem. He first consults 
authoritative precedents for the accepted meanings of 
terms and interpretations of laws. These may be ade- 
quate; but more probably he is faced with conflicting 
precedents, in which case he may resort to experience 
directly and try to determine meanings by examining 
the facts of the case at hand; or, on the other hand, he 
may resort to some more fundamental authorities than 
judicial precedents, to moral principles, traditional 
usage, authoritative legal writing, or the like. 
A second type of problem is the need of correlating 
and harmonizing the vast number of laws of various 
times, by various legislators, and under various codes. 
Legal systems, being the products of centuries, have 
various roots and conflicting tendencies. These must 
be interrelated and codified so as to make them as con- 
sistent as it is possible to make them. Absolute con- 
sistency is here out of the question, but so is absolute 
contradiction.
-P-A-G-E-286
278 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
A third type of problem, closely allied to this, is in- 
volved wherever various lines of interpretation and of 
reasoning are possible and where choice must be made 
between them. Reasons for preferring one to another 
must be thought out, and methodical systems of inter- 
pretation developed for such cases. Since two or more 
interpretations are logically possible, the reflective judge 
is forced to choose between them on the basis of their 
respective usefulness, applicability, conformity to cus- 
tom, and the precedents which they may establish for 
other decisions. ‘‘The law,” in short, is never as simple 
as the words imply. 
One principle or precedent, pushed to the limit of its logic, 
may point to one conclusion; another principle or precedent, 
followed with like logic, may point with equal certainty to 
another. In this conflict we must choose between the two 
paths, selecting one or the other, or perhaps striking out upon 
a third, which will be the resultant of the two forces in combi- 
nation, or will represent the mean between extremes. Let me 
take as an illustration of such conflict the famous case of 
Riggs v. Palmer, 115 N.Y. 506. That case decided that a leg- 
atee who had murdered his testator would not be permitted 
by a court of equity to enjoy the benefits of the will. Con- 
flicting principles were there in competition for the mastery. 
One of them prevailed and vanquished all others. There was 
the principle of the binding force of a will disposing of the es- 
tate of a testator in conformity with law. That principle, 
pushed to the limit of its logic, seemed to uphold the title of 
the murderer. There was the principle that civil courts may 
not add to the pains and penalties of crimes. That pushed to 
the limit of its logic seemed again to uphold his title. But 
over against these was another principle, of greater general- 
ity, its roots deeply fastened in universal sentiments of jus- 
tice, the principle that no man should profit from his own ini- 
quity or take advantage of his own wrong. The logic of this 
principle prevailed over the logic of the others. . . . The judi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
  THINKING IN LAW 279 
cial process is there in microcosm. We go forward with our 
logic, with our analogies, with our philosophies, till we reach a 
certain point. At first we have no trouble with the paths; 
they follow the same lines. Then they begin to diverge and 
we must make a choice between them. History or custom or 
social utility or some compelling sentiment of justice or some- 
times perhaps a semi-instinctive apprehension of the pervad- 
ing spirit of our law, must come to the rescue of the anxious 
judge, and tell him where to go.? 
The fourth type of problem arises, not from the laws, 
but from the facts themselves. A lawyer, especially in 
criminal law, is often as much concerned with the prob- 
lem of what the facts are in the case as with what the law 
isin the case. This introduces us to a whole new set of 
legal intellectual machinery: the jury, the witnesses, 
evidence, cross-examination, the analysis of motives, 
the question of sanity of the criminal, etc. The proc- 
esses are quite familiar, and will be seen to be instru- 
ments of observation and analysis of facts — a topic 
discussed in previous chapters. The more highly these 
instruments are developed and the more extensively 
they are utilized, the more reflective the thinking be- 
comes, and the more adequately and justly can the law 
be applied. 
SUMMARY OF THE ANALYSIS OF LEGAL THINKING 
This bare outline of legal thinking may suffice to in- 
dicate the essential traits of the process; the illustration 
which follows is intended to exhibit the same process in 
1 Benj. N. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process, pp. 40-43. A 
very clear and interesting case of two equally valid interpretations, in 
which that one happened to be chosen by the courts which later led to 
many difficulties — difficulties which the other would have avoided — 
is described in an article by Dean Harlan F. Stone, Colwmbia Law Re- 
view, June, 1922.

concrete form. If this process is concerned well, it avails 
itself of all the instruments of reflective thinking which 
other sciences employ. By careful observation, testing 
of evidence, and experimental investigation, it seeks to 
discover the facts, as any natural science does, by pre- 
cise definition and classification, it seeks to build up a 
unified system of concepts, as any dialectical science 
does; and by the clarification of human ends and ideals, 
it passes judgment on human conduct, as any moral 
science does. Legal thinking is thus seen to be charac- 
terized, not so much by peculiar methods of thought, as 
by its complex subject-matter. 
Section 3. A Case of Reflective Thinking in Law 
Analyzed 
To give concrete meaning to these theoretical consid- 
erations, we shall describe a typical legal case — typical 
in so far as any case can be typical of certain fundamen- 
tals in legal thinking; it is not technically typical of all 
cases, for, being a case in constitutional law, it is not typ- 
ical for criminal law, equity, and other branches of the 
law. It concerns the problem of regulating the hours of 
labor for women. 
We are really not starting at the beginning of the 
problem if we assume that it exists ready-made and 
well defined for the legislators. For whom does the 
problem exist? Who raises it? How isit raised? Or- 
dinarily we say the problem originates in ‘‘ public opin- 
ion,” and that public opinion directs the legislator’s at- 
tention to it. This may be the case, but more usually 
the problem is raised by interested groups or associa- 
tions. The groups undertake investigations, publicity 
campaigns, and propaganda. If these are successful,
-P-A-G-E-289
  THINKING IN LAW 281 
“public opinion’’ may be aroused, and finally the legis- 
lature may take cognizance of the problem. If these 
groups are ‘‘influential” (e.g., a newspaper, or ‘Wall 
Street’’), they may succeed in getting the attention of 
the legislature long before the general public is aware of 
it, and, indeed, if the problem is technical and of only 
limited interest it may be legislated upon without ever 
becoming a matter of ‘“‘public opinion.” But in any case 
the activities of certain interested groups are necessary 
to bring the problem to the consciousness of the legis- 
lator. In fact, so great is the noise of those who are 
whispering in the ear of the legislator, that only the 
persistent presentation of the problem, and its increasing 
acuteness, may expect to draw the attention of the over- 
burdened law maker. 
In our particular case, it might be supposed that the 
women who toiled overlong under unhealthful and in- 
human conditions were first to demand legislation. 
Not so. Indeed, it may be doubted whether most of 
them had any further thought than making the best of a 
hard life. But certain organizations, following the lead 
of others in Europe, and of International Associations 
for Labor Legislation, began agitating the regulation of 
working hours for women. Among the societies aiding 
this movement were the National Consumers’ League, 
the Russell Sage Foundation, Women’s Rights Party, 
United States Industrial Commission, United States 
Bureau of Labor, various labor unions, and similar bod- 
ies. Some of these were Government institutions, but 
most of them, certainly the earliest of them, were pri- 
vate enterprises. The societies either directly employed 
or received the codperation of numerous scientists, phy- 
sicians, economists, etc. 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
  282° REFLECTIVE THINKING 
After years of investigation and propaganda carried 
on by these groups, several State Legislatures finally 
passed laws attempting some sort of regulation. To 
confine our attention to one of these, let us see what 
happened to such a law passed by the State Legislature 
of Illinois, June 17, 1893. The law is entitled “‘ An act to 
regulate the manufacture of clothing, wearing apparel, 
and other articles in the State, and to provide for the ap- 
pointment of State inspectors to enforce same, and to 
make an appropriation therefor.” Among other things 
it provided that ‘“‘No female shall be employed in any 
factory or workshop more than eight hours in any one 
day or forty-eight hours in any one week.” 
On a certain day of February, 1894, a Mr. Ritchie 
was arrested on the charge of employing a woman more 
than eight hours a day. He waived jury trial, and, 
upon being fined five dollars by the Justice of the Peace, 
appealed to the Criminal Court of Cook County, where 
a similar procedure took place. From this court he ap- 
pealed by ‘‘writ of error” to the Supreme Court of IIli- 
nois. Obviously the question at issue was not whether 
this man was guilty under the law, for his guilt was ad- 
mitted; the question was whether the law itself was ‘‘in 
error,” or whether it was consistent with the constitu- 
tion of the State of Illinois. The ruling of the court was 
that the statute was inconsistent with the principles laid 
down in the constitution, and consequently the judg- 
ment of the Criminal Court of Cook County was re- 
versed and the case was remanded to that court with di- 
rections to dismiss the prosecution. The significance of 
the case was, of course, not that Mr. Ritchie escaped the

  THINKING IN LAW 283 
whole act was rendered void and ineffective, and the will 
of the legislators, and of the groups immediately re- 
sponsible for the legislation, was frustrated. 
Now let us return to our case, to analyze the reason- 
ing involved. The following extracts are taken from 
the opinion of the court, as delivered by Mr. Justice 
Magruder, and are arranged under topical headings to 
suggest the structure of the argument: ! 
(1) The location of the main points at issue: (a) 
right of contract, (b) police power: 
The main objection urged against the Act, and that to 
which the discussion of counsel on both sides is chiefly di- 
rected, related to the validity of section 5. It is contended by 
counsel for plaintiff in error, that that section is unconstitu- 
tional as imposing unwarranted restrictions upon the right to 
contract. On the other hand, it is claimed by counsel for 
The People, that the act is a sanitary provision and justifiable 
as an exercise of the police power of the State. 
(2) The precise definition of terms involved in the 
first point: (a) “right to contract” and “ employment.” 
Does the provision in question restrict the right to con- 
tract? The words, “no female shall be employed,” import ac- 
tion on the part of two persons. There must be a person who 
does the act of employing, and a person who consents to the 
act of being employed. Webster defines employment as not 
only “the act of employing,” but ‘also the state of being 
employed.” The prohibition of the statute is, therefore, two- 
fold, first, that no manufacturer or proprietor of a factory or 
workshop shall employ any female therein more than eight 
hours in one day, and, second, that no female shall consent to 
be so employed. It thus prohibits employer and employee 
from uniting their minds, or agreeing upon any longer service 
during one day than eight hours. In other words, they are 
prohibited, the one from contracting to employ, and the other 
1 Ritchie v. The People, 155 Ill. 101-17.
-P-A-G-E-292
  284 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
from contracting to be employed, otherwise than as directed. 
“To be employed in anything means not only the act of doing 
it, but also to be engaged to do it; to be under contract or or- 
ders to doit.” (United States v. Morris, 14 Pet. 464.) Hence 
a direction that a person shall not be employed more than a 
specified number of hours in one day, is at the same time a di- 
rection that such person shall not be under contract to work 
for more than a specified number of hours in one day. It fol- 
lows that section 5 does limit and restrict the right of the 
manufacturer and his employee to contract with each other in 
reference to the hours of labor. 
(b) “Liberty and property rights.” 
Is the restriction thus imposed an infringement upon the 
constitutional rights of the manufacturer and the employee? 
Section 2 of article 2 of the constitution of Illinois provides 
that “‘no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property, 
without due process of law.” A number of cases have arisen 
within recent years in which the courts have had occasion to 
consider this provision, or one similar to it, and its meaning 
has been quite clearly defined. The privilege of contracting 
is both a liberty and a property right. (Frorer v. The Peo- 
ple, 141 Ill. 171.) Liberty includes the right to acquire prop- 
erty, and that means and includes the right to make and en- 
force contracts. (The State v. Loomis, 115 Mo. 307.) The 
right to use, buy and sell property and contract in respect 
thereto is protected by the constitution. Labor is property, 
and the laborer has the same right to sell his labor and to con- 
tract with reference thereto, as has any other property owner. 
In this country the legislature has no power to prevent per- 
sons who are sui juris from making their own contracts, 
nor can it interfere with the freedom of contract between 
the workman and the employer. The right to labor or employ 
labor, and make contracts in respect thereto upon such terms 
as may be agreed upon between the parties, is included in 
the constitutional guaranty above quoted. (State v. Good- 
will, 33 W. Va. 179; Godcharles v. Wigeman, 113 Pa. St. 431; 
Braceville Coal Co. v. The People, 147 Ill. 66.) The protec- 
tion of property is one of the objects for which free govern-
-P-A-G-E-293
     THINKING IN LAW 285 
ments are instituted among men. (Const. of Il. art. 2, sec. 1.) 
The right to acquire, possess, and protect property includes 
the right to make reasonable contracts. (Commonwealth v. 
Perry, 155 Mass. 117.) And when an owner is deprived of 
one of the attributes of property, like the right to make con- 
tracts, he is deprived of his property within the meaning of the 
constitution. (Matter of Application of Jacobs, 98 N.Y. 98.) 
The fundamental rights of Englishmen, brought to this coun- 
try by its original settlers and wrested from time to time in 
the progress of history from the sovereigns of the English na- 
tion, have been reduced by Blackstone to three principal or 
primary articles: “the right of personal security, and the 
right of personal liberty, and the right of private property.” 
(1 Blacks. Com. marg. page 129.) The right to contract is 
the only way by which a person can rightfully acquire prop- 
erty by hisown labor. ‘“‘Of all the ‘rights of persons’ it is the 
most essential to human happiness.” (Leep v. St. L., I. M. 
& 8. Ry. Co. 58 Ark. 407.) 
(3) Partial conclusion: Right of contract being a right 
of liberty and property, is guaranteed by the constitu- 
tion, subject to limitations which must be defined, viz.: 
(a) ‘‘due process of law.” 
This right to contract, which is thus included in the funda- 
mental rights of liberty and property, cannot be taken away 
“without due process of law.” The words “due process of 
law”’ have been held to be synonymous with the words “law 
of the land.” (The State v. Loomis, supra; Frorer v. The 
People, supra.) ... The “law of the land” is “general public 
law binding upon all the members of the community, under all 
circumstances, and not partial or private laws, affecting the 
rights of private individuals or classes of individuals.” (Mil- 
lett v. The People, 117 Ill. 294.) The “‘law of the land”’ is 
the opposite of “arbitrary, unequal and partial legislation.” 
(The State v. Loomis, supra.) The legislature has no right to 
deprive one class of persons of privileges allowed to other per- 
sons under like conditions. The man, who is forbidden to ac- 
quire and enjoy property in the same manner in which the
-P-A-G-E-294
  286 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
rest of the community is permitted to acquire and enjoy it, is 
deprived of liberty in particulars of primary importance to his 
pursuit of happiness. If one man is denied the right to con- 
tract as he has hitherto done under the law, and as others are 
still allowed to do by the law, he is deprived of both liberty 
and property to the extent to which he is thus deprived of 
such right... . 
(b) “Reasonable” vs. “arbitrary” limitations. 
Weare not unmindful that the right to contract may be sub- 
ject to limitations growing out of the duties which the indi- 
vidual owes to society, to the public, or to the government. 
These limitations are sometimes imposed by the obligation to 
80 use one’s own as not to injure another, by the character of 
property as affected with a public interest or devoted to a 
public use, by the demands of public policy or the necessity 
of protecting the public from fraud or injury, by the want of 
capacity, by the needs of the necessitous borrower as against 
the demands of the extortionate lender. But the power of 
the legislature to thus limit the right to contract must rest 
upon some reasonable basis, and cannot be arbitrarily exer- 
cised. It has been said that such power is based in every 
case on some condition, and not on the absolute right to con- 
trol. Where legislative enactments, which operate upon 
classes of individuals only, have been held to be valid, it has 
been where the classification was reasonable, and not arbi- 
trary. (Leep v. St.L., I.M. & 8. Ry. Co. supra; The State v. 
Loomis, supra.) 
(4) Conclusion: the enactment is void, because limita- 
tion of right of contract would be arbitrary. 
Applying these principles to the consideration of section 5, 
we are led irresistibly to the conclusion, that it is an unconsti- 
tutional and void enactment.... We are inclined to regard 
the act as one that is partial and discriminating in its charac- 
ter. If it be construed as applying only to manufacturers of 
clothing, wearing apparel and articles of a similar nature,
-P-A-G-E-295
  
THINKING IN LAW 287 
we can see no reasonable ground for prohibiting such manu- 
facturers and their employees from contracting for more than 
eight hours of work in one day, while other manufacturers and 
their employees are not forbidden so to contract. If the act be 
construed as applying to manufacturers of all kinds of prod- 
ucts, there is no good reason why the prohibition should be 
directed against manufacturers and their employees, and not 
against merchants, or builders, or contractors, or carriers, or 
farmers, or persons engaged in other branches of industry, 
and their employees therein. Women employed by manu- 
facturers are forbidden by section 5 to make contracts to labor 
longer than eight hours in a day, while women employed as 
saleswomen in stores, or as domestic servants, or as book- 
keepers, or stenographers, or type-writers, or in laundries, or 
other occupations not embraced under the head of manufac- 
turing, are at liberty to contract for as many hours of labor 
in a day as they choose. The manner in which the section 
thus discriminates against one class of employees and employ- 
ers and in favor of all others, places it in opposition to the 
constitutional guarantees hereinbefore discussed, and so ren- 
ders it invalid. Section 1 of article 2 of the constitution of Illi- 
nois provides as follows: ‘‘ All men are by nature free and in- 
dependent, and have certain inherent and inalienable rights; 
among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
To secure these rights and the protection of property, govern- 
ments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers 
from the consent of the governed.” Liberty, as has already 
been stated, included the right to make contracts, as well with 
reference to the amount and duration of labor to be per- 
formed, as concerning any other lawful matter. Hence, the 
right to make contracts is an inherent and inalienable one, and 
any attempt to unreasonably abridge it is opposed to the 
constitution. As was aptly said in Leep v. St.L., I.M. & S. 
Ry. Co. supra: ‘‘ Where the subject of contract is purely and 
exclusively private, unaffected by any public interest or duty 
to person, to society or government, and the parties are capa- 
ble of contracting, there is a condition existing upon which 
the legislature cannot interfere for the purpose of prohibiting 
the contract, or controlling the terms thereof.”

(5) Analysis of the second main point: “police 
power.” (a) scope of “police power.” 
... But it is claimed on behalf of defendant in error, that this 
section can be sustained as an exercise of the police power of 
the State. The police power of the State is that power which 
enables it to promote the health, comfort, safety and welfare 
of society. It is very broad and far-reaching, but is not with- 
out its limitations. Legislative acts passed in pursuance of it 
must not be in conflict with the constitution, and must have 
some relation to the ends sought to be accomplished; that is 
to say, to the comfort, welfare or safety of society. Where 
the ostensible object of an enactment is to secure the public 
comfort, welfare or safety, it must appear to be adapted to 
that end; it cannot invade the rights of person and property 
under the guise of a mere police regulation, when it is not such 
in fact; and where such an act takes away the property of a 
citizen or interferes with his personal liberty, it is the prov- 
ince of the courts to determine whether it is really an appro- 
priate measure for the promotion of the comfort, safety and 
welfare of society.... 
(b) This act not a public sanitary measure. 
There is nothing in the title of the act of 1893 to indicate 
that it isa sanitary measure. The first three sections contain 
provisions for keeping workshops in a cleanly state and for in- 
spection to ascertain whether they are so kept. But there is 
nothing in the nature of the employment contemplated by the 
act which is in itself unhealthy, or unlawful, or injurious to 
the public morals or welfare. Laws restraining the sale and 
use of opium and intoxicating liquor have been sustained as 
valid under the police power. (Ah Lim». Territory, 1 Wash. 
156; Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623.) Undoubtedly, the 
public health, welfare and safety may be endangered by the 
general use of opium and intoxicating drinks. But it cannot 
be said that the same consequences are likely to flow from the 
manufacture of clothing, wearing apparel and other similar 
articles. ... 
It is not the nature of the things done, but the sex of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
  THINKING IN LAW 289 
persons doing them, which is made the basis of the claim that 
the act is a measure for the promotion of the public health. 
It is sought to sustain the act as an exercise of the police 
power upon the alleged ground, that it is designed to protect 
woman on account of her sex and physique. It will not be 
denied that woman is entitled to the same rights under the 
constitution, to make contracts with reference to her labor as 
are secured thereby to men. The first section of the four- 
teenth amendment to the constitution of the United States 
provides: ‘No State shall make or enforce any law which 
shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the 
United States, nor shall any State deprive any person of life, 
liberty, or property without due process of law, nor deny to 
any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the 
law.” It has been held that a woman is both a “citizen” and 
a “person”’ within the meaning of this section... . 
... The question is not whether a particular employment 
is a proper one for the use of female labor, but the question is 
whether, in an employment which is conceded to be lawful 
in itself and suitable for women to engage in, she shall be 
deprived of the right to determine for herself how many 
hours she can and may work during each day. There is no 
reasonable ground — at least none which has been made man- 
ifest to us in the arguments of counsel — for fixing upon eight 
hours in one day as the limit within which woman can work 
without injury to her physique, and beyond which, if she 
work, injury will necessarily follow. But the police power of 
the State can only be permitted to limit or abridge such a 
fundamental right as the right to make contracts, when the 
exercise of such power is necessary to promote the health, 
comfort, welfare or safety of society or the public; and it is 
questionable whether it can be exercised to prevent injury to 
the individual engaged in a particular calling. ... 
(6) Conclusion: the enactment is void, for there is no 
proof that it is a “‘police’’ measure; i.e., necessary to 
promote public health, comfort, welfare or safety. 
... When a health law is challenged in the courts as uncon- 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  290 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
stitutional on the ground that it arbitrarily interferes with 
personal liberty and private property without due process of 
law, the courts must be able to see that it has at least in fact 
some relation to the public health, that the public health is 
the end actually aimed at, and that it is appropriate and 
adapted to that end. This we have not been able to see in 
this law, and we must, therefore, pronounce it unconstitu- 
tional and void. 
On the face of it this argument seems to have the fol- 
lowing characteristics: (1) Certain rights are guaranteed 
by the constitution to the citizens of the State. Such 
rights are liberty, the right of property, the right of con- 
tract, right against “partial and discriminating” legis- 
lation. Also certain powers are granted to the gov- 
ernment as the police power. (2) All that the court 
attempts to do is to determine whether a particular act 
violates these rights or exceeds these powers. (3) The 
legitimate interpretation of debatable terms is largely 
determined by precedent or authority; i.e., by previous 
judgments of the courts or by recognized writers on the 
law (e.g., Blackstone). (4) The authority of the consti- 
tution and of precedent being unquestioned, the validity 
of a law can be definitely determined by formal reason- 
ing, without a study of the empirical conditions and con- 
sequences at issue. 
But on closer inspection this logical simplicity van- 
ishes. In the first place, when we ask for definitions 
of liberty, right of property, right of contract, police 
power, etc., we find no general agreement. Precedents 
can be found on either side of the question. Even so 
apparently definite words as “to be employed” offer 
difficulties in definition. Does employment imply con- 
tract? If so, does the “‘privilege of contracting” involve 
liberty and property rights? When the exercise of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-299
THINKING IN LAW 291 
police power conflicts with rights of contract and prop- 
erty, which shall take precedence? If these rights can 
be limited by legislation, what is ‘reasonable’ and 
what is ‘‘arbitrary”’ limitation of these rights? How 
may these questions be answered? The judge is sup- 
posed to answer them by examining the meaning of the 
constitution. Theoretically he is supposed to ‘‘inter- 
pret”’ the intention which the framers of the constitu- 
tion had in employing those terms. But practically 
that is impossible, since the framers of the constitution 
yrobably had as varied ‘‘intentions”’ as legislators have 
to-day. Whatever their intentions may have been, 
most of them are impossible to discover, since no ade- 
quate account was left by the framers of the constitu- 
tion. Even if we had an authoritative version of their 
intentions, present conditions are so different from con- 
ditions at that time that they would have to be “‘inter- 
preted”’ in the light of the present conditions. 
To fall back on the precedents of the courts is only a 
specious solution to these problems. For, in the first 
place, precedents can usually be found to support either 
side of acase. Theoretically, too, to fall back on prece- 
dent is futile, for on what basis does the authority of the 
precedent rest? If the judgment takes its authority 
from the constitution, it is subject to most of the limita- 
tions of constitutional authority, which have just been 
pointed out. If it rests upon the judgment’s ‘‘reason- 
ableness” with respect to the case which it judges, the 
whole basis of authority is shifted from given principles 
to particular facts. The validity of any judgment, 
then, rests upon its adequacy in view of the facts of the 
case, precedent or no precedent. Add to these criti- 
cisms the fact that departure from precedent is itself 
   
-P-A-G-E-300
  292 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
sufficiently justified by precedent, and there seems to be 
little left in practice of the authoritative principle upon 
which constitutional law theoretically rests. 
The dialectical or deductive form of law, therefore, 
conceals beneath its formal simplicity a vast amount of 
empirical thinking which is necessary to define the terms 
of the argument. In this case such terms as employ- 
ment, health, comfort, public welfare, etc., needed to be 
empirically defined, and upon the meaning assigned 
by empirical considerations to them really rested the 
outcome of the case. It is possible to argue that an 
eight-hour law for women is a violation of the right of 
contract; the right of contract is a property right; a 
property right is guaranteed to the citizen by the con- 
stitution ; whatever is inconsistent with the constitution 
is void; THEREFORE, the law is void. Although this looks 
like a perfect mathematical demonstration, it has the 
certainty of such a demonstration merely in form. Its 
certainty rests upon the precision of definition of its 
terms. What would happen to mathematics if a tri- 
angle were as difficult to define as the right of liberty? 
What would happen to physics, if horse-power were as 
vague a term as police power? No calculations could be 
made on the basis of such a terminology. A vague idea 
is not clarified by giving ita name. Consequently legal 
science may develop a complicated system of legal ideas, 
each consistent with the other, and the whole based 
upon constitutional principles, but this formal consist- 
ency will have only as much logical force as the ideas 
employed have precision of meaning. 
Social and moral sciences, in general, have this disad- 
vantage when compared with the mathematical and 
physical sciences. Mathematics is precise and certain,
-P-A-G-E-301
  THINKING IN LAW 293 
as we have seen, because it can deal with purely ideal 
symbols which are capable of absolute definition. 
Whether actual circles are really round or not makes lit- 
tle difference to it, for it deals only with ideal circles, 
which by definition are perfect. Physical sciences are, 
to be sure, engaged in the study of physical facts, but 
they deal with them in terms of quantitative measures 
which allow a very great precision. The science of law 
has neither of these advantages. It can deal neither 
with purely ideal data, nor with physical facts which 
admit of precise, quantitative measurement. It must 
deal with physical facts, and it must deal with their 
least definable qualities. Human wants and social 
needs are vague, fluctuating things. They would be dif- 
ficult enough to define even in a static society. Ina 
social environment which is continually and radically 
changing, these wants and needs are continually assum- 
ing newforms. The process of defining them must, there- 
fore, likewise be continuous, reconstructive, and experi- 
mental. The definition of a circle, or a volt, is an en- 
tirely different process from the definition of the rights 
of a citizen. Nevertheless, the rights of a citizen need 
defining, and where the legislator fails to do so, the 
judge must do it. 
To return to our case: the main argument of the 
case, as quoted above, when extracted from its con- 
stitutional and technical setting, runs about as follows: 
This act is an unreasonable infringement on the right of 
a@ woman to use her own judgment as to how long and 
under what conditions she shall work. If she wants to 
ruin her health, that is her affair, not ours. The law 
can interfere only when the pustic health demands it. 
If it can be shown that for a woman to work more than
-P-A-G-E-302
  294, REFLECTIVE THINKING 
eight hours a day at the manufacture of clothing is not 
only prejudicial to her health, but also to the health, 
safety, and welfare of the public, this interference on the 
part of the Government would be reasonable. 
The chief point here is not whether the Government 
should respect individual rights, for both sides admit 
that; nor whether the Government should protect the 
public welfare or not, for both sides admit this also. In 
any act of Government these aims may be conceded. 
In the constitution they are formulated, but of necessity 
in the most general terms. People can tell in general 
what they want a government to do, but, when it comes 
to the particular application of that on which they are 
in general agreed, differences of judgment immediately 
arise. So here, the real question at issue is just how 
our general aims apply to this situation. That problem 
arises afresh for every new situation. Hence the neces- 
sity of a system of deliberative judgments as we have 
them in the courts. 
In answering this type of problem the judge must turn 
from the constitution to experience. No amount of rea- 
soning from principle will throw light on whether or not 
women’s health is prejudiced by working more than 
eight hours; nothing in the constitution will tell whether 
or not the hours of labor for women affect the public 
health. The appeal here is to facts. And in this case 
the judge threw out the act because he thought no facts 
had been introduced to prove that the act really did 
what its defenders claimed for it. Formally, of course, 
he threw it out because it was unconstitutional. 
Fifteen years later this same Mr. Ritchie was again 
haled before the same court to test the constitutionality 
of a similar law for regulating the hours of labor for 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
  THINKING IN LAW | 295 
women in factories — this time a ten-hour law passed in 
1909. (Ritchie & Co. v. Wayman, 244 Ill. 509.) An 
entirely new bench of judges was sitting. The same 
old arguments were raised about the right of contract, 
liberty, etc. The defense rested its case largely upon 
the decision and the argument quoted above. But the 
prosecution, under the leadership of Mr. Louis Brandeis, 
adopted entirely new tactics. Mr. Brandeis submitted 
a brief of over one hundred pages, of which only two 
pages were devoted to the technical legal aspects of the 
problem.! The bulk of the brief was a mass of statistics 
gathered from all over the world, of testimonies from 
prominent physicians and physiologists, of reports from 
labor commissions, and the like, all proving beyond 
doubt the real point of the argument, namely, that usu- 
ally the health of women is seriously undermined by the 
fatigue and strain of long hours, and that these effects 
were prejudicial to the health of their children and thus 
to the welfare of the people at large. 
To give the main features of this famous document 
will show the type of facts of which law must take cog- 
nizance, and how they are made known. They were col- 
lected under the direction of Miss Josephine Goldmark, 
and may be found in her volume entitled Fatigue and 
Efficiency. The evidence contained the following items 
among others: 
1. Testimonies of a number of physicians, factory inspec- 
tors, statistical bureaus, insurance companies, etc., to 
the effect that 
(a) Women in factories are more subject to fatigue and 
overstrain caused by speed, monotony, piece-work, 
etc., than men are.

(b) Women are more subject to disease than men. 
A detailed account of the effect of fatigue on nerves and 
muscles, with charts showing the effect of long-contin- 
ued stimulation of muscles, the physiological functions 
of rest, etc. 
. Testimonies of experts, submitted in the courts of Eu- 
rope, and of the United States, as to the bad effects of 
long hours on health, safety, relation between fatigue 
and disease, etc. 
. Statistics showing the relative frequency of industrial 
accidents, and the relative production for the working 
hours of the day, proving beyond doubt that increased 
accidents and decreased efficiency result from fatigue. 
. Testimonies regarding effect of fatigue and overwork on 
morals, infant mortality, health of the next generation, 
and the general benefit of society. 
. Testimonies regarding the benefits of leisure and recrea- 
tion. 
. Reports from countries who had put into effect laws for 
shorter hours, proving the efficacy of such legislation to 
bring about the results desired. 
. Reports and testimonies showing that shorter hours do 
not eventually restrict the output, for the gain in effi- 
ciency and quality of output soon offsets the initial re- 
duction of output. 
. Testimonies showing the ill effects of allowing overtime, 
and urging uniformity of regulation for all. 
Statistics supporting the above from various industries, 
for example, laundries, mercantile establishments, mil- 
linery and dressmaking shops, restaurants, etc. 
The presentation of these facts really determined the 
judgment of the court. ‘‘We take judicial cognizance of 
all matters of general knowledge” was the dictum of the 
courts. One wonders, of course, whether the reversal of 
the decision was really due to the introduction of these 
facts. It is possible that, had the same judges been sit- 
ting here who sat in the previous case, these facts might
-P-A-G-E-305
THINKING IN LAW 297 
have left them immovable. Or it might be that, even 
if they had changed their minds in the meantime, the 
change was due not to more facts, but to pressure of 
public sentiment or party policy. There is abundance 
of evidence to show that judges are very human in their 
capacity to be influenced consciously or unconsciously 
by ‘‘extraneous” forces. Political parties, for instance, 
ever since the days of John Marshall, have realized the 
importance of getting “their own men” on the bench. 
But granting for the present that the judges in both 
cases were skilled and conscientious legal logicians, the 
case is significant and typical to this extent, that it indi- 
cates how and why the intelligence of the court is de- 
pendent on empirical facts, as well as on legal tradition 
and formal reasoning. This does not mean, of course, 
that the technical difficulties which had stood in the 
way of the former act were simply ignored, and that the 
constitution was made of no effect. It means that the 
choice of rival interpretations of these technical matters 
was determined largely by the empirical and practical 
issues at stake. For instance, the earlier act was en- 
titled “‘an act to regulate the manufacture of clothing.” 
Since the constitution gives no such general power of 
regulation to the legislature, and since the title therefore 
proved to be a stumbling-block in the courts, the enac- 
tors of the second act emphasized the fact that it was 
an act to protect the safety and welfare of the people, 
which power was expressly granted to the legislature. 
The questions of the right of contract, unfair discrimina- 
tions, etc., were also decided in the light of these facts. 
In the former case the right of contract was held to place 
limits upon such use of the police power (precedents 
were given) ; in the latter case the police power was held
-P-A-G-E-306
  298 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
to place limits upon the right of contract (precedents 
were given). Which of the two judgments would be 
made depended upon the relative importance which the 
different judges attached to the evil effects of long hours 
on the one side, or of loss of freedom on the other, rather 
than upon inconsistencies of argument. Similarly the 
matter of unfair discrimination was decided by the sig- 
nificance attached to sex differences, to conditions exist- 
ing in factories and laundries, etc., rather than by appeal 
to an authoritative interpretation by constitutional 
principles. Thus the meaning of these concepts (right 
of contract, etc.) gets continually redefined in the light 
of changing conditions, and at the same time by using 
such concepts the changing conditions are subjected to 
some sort of order and coherency. These concepts or 
“principles,” precisely because they are vague and capa- 
ble of various interpretations, are useful in maintaining 
a flexible social order in the face of continual change and 
a general regularity and consistency in the face of a be- 
wildering multitude of details. But when such principles 
are assumed to be fixed and definite, like mathematical 
axioms, and to give to law a demonstrative certainty, 
they confuse and obstruct social practice by concealing 
social uncertainty under such sham certainties. The 
law is, of course, deductive or demonstrative in form, 
for the applications of a law must be demonstrated to 
follow from it; and this implies that the form or struc- 
ture of legal reasoning must be logical. But skill in 
formal reasoning alone will never make an able lawyer. 
Formal reasoning is adequate only so long as it is pos- 
sible to decide a case on the basis of unambiguous prec- 
edents. If the issue can really be defined and deter- 
mined merely by deducing the inferences from accepted
-P-A-G-E-307
  
THINKING IN LAW | 299 
precedents, if the precedents adequately “cover” the 
case, the reasoning involved is purely dialectical. But 
this practically never happens, since history does not 
repeat itself accurately enough to enable a lawyer (un- 
less his thinking is very superficial) to apply conclusions 
based on the past directly to a present case, without 
raising empirical problems. Reflective thinking in law 
has the difficult task of applying a rigorous dialectical 
discipline to a subject-matter which is both indefinite 
and fluctuating; if it sacrifices precision of meaning to 
formal consistency, it loses its honesty; if it sacrifices 
consistency to the drift of opinion, it loses its power. To 
think well on legal problems requires both ‘‘reason”’ and 
“wisdom”; for it involves both the intricacies of con- 
sistent argument and the intricacies of interpreting the 
meaning of concepts in the light of ever-changing facts 
and ideals.

  CHAPTER XII 
REFLECTIVE THOUGHT IN THE REALM OF ETHICS 
Section 1. The Ethical Situation 
In Chapter IX the general problems, methods, and dif- 
ficulties of evaluation were discussed. Since ethics at- 
tempts to evaluate human character and conduct, it 
encounters the difficulties which were seen to confront 
all reflective evaluation. In the first place, we saw that 
there are immediate values which cannot ‘be measured 
by any standard common to a number of individuals, 
but which have to be judged privately, each individual 
gauging as best he can his own liking for the various al- 
ternatives between which he must choose. To measure 
values objectively, we must consider them in their medi- 
ate aspects, as means to the realization of certain ends; 
and our ability to do this depends upon our readiness to 
take certain ends for granted, so that we may apply ob- 
jective methods to determine which means will best sat- 
isfy those ends. In general, we saw that the soundness 
of our evaluation depends upon our success in seeing all 
the implications of a decision, and in estimating cor- 
rectly our desires with respect to them. 
Has evaluation in ethics any peculiar characteristics 
distinguishing it from other kinds of evaluation? What 
reasons are there, if any, for giving separate attention to 
reflection in ethics? This question is one upon which 
mankind has reached no general agreement. To some 
ethics is a unique subject with methods all its own, 
while others hold there is no difference between the logic 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
  302 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
by which ethical questions are decided and the logic of 
any other field. ‘There are also many intermediate 
positions. 
Most people recognize that ethical problems have a 
special importance, even if they believe that the logic of 
ethical judgment is the same as that of any other field. 
In analyzing the process of legal decision, we have seen 
the very elaborate machinery which men set up to solve 
certain problems arising in their relations with one an- 
other. But the solutions reached by this machinery are 
not always satisfactory. People ask: Are the laws just? 
And even if the answer ‘‘yes”’ is returned, the very ask- 
ing of the question implies a criticism of the laws, a 
reviewing of them in the light of standards which are 
regarded as more fundamental than they. The part 
which such standards may play in the judicial process 
has been suggested. 
To arrive at certain ultimate standards, by which all 
else can be evaluated, is the cardinal problem of reflec- 
tion in ethics. It is a problem which every one, who 
participates in social life, must solve in some fashion, 
well or ill. Every man, consciously or unconsciously, 
employs some set of ultimate standards, be they con- 
sistent with each other or inconsistent. Moreover, to 
question a person’s ultimate standards is to touch him 
at a very tender point, namely, his moral consciousness. 
In the chapter on evaluation we remarked that re- 
flection is hindered in this field even more than in others 
by prejudices, judgments already formed in advance of 
the act of judging. Prejudices in ethics, being sup- 
ported by the moral consciousness which we have men- 
tioned, are of all prejudices the most powerful. All of 
us have been taught from our earliest years that some
-P-A-G-E-311
  REFLECTION IN ETHICS 303 
actions are right, others wrong, and, since it is of the 
first importance that our conduct should not be such as 
to bring ourselves or others into difficulty, this moral in- 
doctrination has ordinarily been as thorough as possi- 
ble. Erroneous opinions about physics or geography 
are not ordinarily considered serious except for the phys- 
ical scientist, for a man may believe that the earth 
is flat without harming himself or any one else. Erro- 
neous opinions about morals are another matter, and it is 
generally believed that every effort ought to be made to 
prevent any one from supposing that he is at liberty 
to appropriate the possessions of others without their 
consent, or to follow his impulses at every moment with- 
out restraint of any sort. It is not important, in other 
words, that more than a limited number of persons 
should possess mathematical and scientific knowledge, 
since such knowledge is required for only a fraction of 
our activities; but all persons at all times need guidance 
in their personal conduct, and every precaution is ac- 
cordingly taken that no one is left unsupplied with moral 
convictions. 
Furthermore, the beliefs on which our conduct is 
based are often such as to compel us to forego pleasures 
and satisfactions which we desire very much, and, un- 
less we are strongly convinced of the truth of these be- 
liefs, and of their universal applicability, we are likely 
to make exceptions to them in our favor whenever they 
conflict with our desires. The suspension of judgment, 
consequently, which is enjoined upon scientists and in- 
vestigators in the field of abstract knowledge in general, 
is not thought an advantage when beliefs about conduct 
are concerned. It is thought that any one not entirely 
convinced that theft is wrong is dangerously likely to 
 
-P-A-G-E-312
  304 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
dispense with honesty in his personal practice. To call 
into question any generally accepted moral opinion is, 
therefore, to appear in the light of one seeking justifica- 
tion for moral lapses, or at least as the instigator of such 
lapses in others: moral initiative is indistinguishable 
from immorality. Under the circumstances, it is not 
surprising that the free discussion out of which comes 
progress in intellectual matters has not prevailed in the 
ethical field, and that the positive results elsewhere 
achieved are conspicuously lacking in ethics. 
The conditions under which one ordinarily comes to 
the study of ethics are, then, as follows. Before he has 
ever reflected about right and wrong at all, he has had 
impressed upon him a code of rules for conduct, the va- 
lidity of which, he has been taught, is not open to debate. 
These rules appear to be, in the main, a set of prohibi- 
tions, the more obvious purpose of which is to safeguard 
the welfare of others. Large numbers of the acts which 
he would naturally be prompted to perform are forbid- 
den him, and the estimation in which he is held depends 
upon acceptance of these prohibitions so that his fellow 
men may prosper. Tosuch an extent is this true that in 
the popular view morality is almost the same thing as 
self-denial and, especially, self-sacrifice. If I do what I 
wish I am not, perhaps, immoral, but neither in any 
positive sense moral, while if I yield my desires so that 
others may gratify theirs, my virtue is incontestable. 
The interests of the individual and the interests of so- 
ciety are in conflict, and the individual is moral in pro- 
portion as he sacrifices his welfare to the welfare of the 
whole. Should he decline to make the sacrifice, society 
will exact it: the policeman will deal with him if he dis- 
regards such of the social demands as are enacted into 
 
-P-A-G-E-313
  REFLECTION IN ETHICS 305 
law, and public opinion will bring pressure to bear upon 
him in behalf of the remainder. 
This system of repressions comes to appear, however, 
not merely as a thwarting of part of the individual’s de- 
sires. It is also an assurance of satisfaction to another 
part of his desires. If I am prevented from interfering 
with my neighbor’s interests, he also is prevented from 
interfering with mine. At the price of accepting duties, 
I acquire rights, and the two are correlative; I cannot 
enjoy the latter without submitting to the former. 
Here, again, some of the rights are guaranteed by law, 
and if they are threatened I can enlist the force of the 
state in my behalf; others are safeguarded only by pub- 
lic opinion. I can sue a man who refuses to pay his law- 
ful debts to me; if I convey some information under 
promise of secrecy and the promise is broken, though I 
have no legal redress, the disapproval of the circle in 
which we move may be quite as effective a punishment 
as fine or imprisonment. Any moral and legal code 
whatever secures as well as circumscribes my field of in- 
terests. 
Reflection on morals takes place when we begin to 
consider the justification of the moral code in detail. It 
starts often from a comparison of the moral standards of 
different times and different peoples. An individual on 
whom any existing set of moral rules did not press with 
excessive severity would be comparatively unlikely to 
question the justice of the customs of his people if he 
knew no others. Finding, however, that some of the 
things of which he is deprived by the laws under which 
he lives are not forbidden to the citizens of other coun- 
tries, who in spite of their greater freedom do not come 
to disaster, he begins to question the necessity of the
-P-A-G-E-314
  306 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
particular tabu, and finally raises the question of the 
justification of each and every prohibition. The price 
paid for security may seem exorbitant, or, if it is not ex- 
orbitant on the whole, the individual may wish to be 
shown in detail what will be returned to him for each 
particular act of self-denial. If we suppose him to de- 
cide that no adequate quid pro quo is in sight, is his first 
duty to authority, or is his liberty sacred? Must I al- 
ways do what society regards as my duty, or may I take 
issue with society if I think its laws, written or unwrit- 
ten, unjustified, and act on my individual opinion? 
Questions of this kind lead to the formation of ideals, 
ultimate standards, in the light of which choices are 
made and justified. It is the conflict between these 
ideals which gives rise to the cardinal problem of reflec- 
tive ethics. Between two ultimate standards is there 
any way of deciding which is the better? In previous 
chapters we studied cases in which old views gave place 
to new which were generally accepted, and by examin- 
ing the reasons for these changes we gained some knowl- 
edge of reflective thinking. But in ethical controversies 
there has been much less general agreement as to which 
of the various proposed solutions is best. In mathemat- 
ics or physics or astronomy it was possible to illustrate the 
nature of reflective thought by analyzing solutions which 
were undeniably solutions. Though no one supposes 
that in the Copernican astronomy the last word on the 
movements of celestial bodies is uttered, its relative satis- 
factoriness as against, for example, the Ptolemaic astron- 
omy, is questioned by no one competent to judge. The 
logician, when he attempts to distinguish between the 
better and the worse in thought by discovering the char- 
acteristics in which the heliocentric theory differs from
-P-A-G-E-315
  REFLECTION IN ETHICS 307 
the geocentric, runs no risk of failing to identify the bet- 
ter theory. But in ethics there is no such certainty. 
In considering a genuine ethical problem we are not at 
liberty to take any suggested solution as the solution, and 
compare it. with alternative solutions. There is no pre- 
eminently and indubitably satisfactory solution, and 
consequently no analysis of conclusive proof in ethics 
can be offered. 
If this be true, what profit may we reasonably expect 
from the analysis of a controversy in ethics? Let us not 
answer this question without experiment. Let us ex- 
amine carefully the discussion of some important ethical 
problem, and see whether any kind of progress or devel- 
opment may be noted in the thinking, such as would 
give us some criteria for evaluating reflective thought in 
ethics. It would be rash to say that all thinking was 
vain and profitless which did not reach a solution to its 
problem upon which every one could agree. The early 
Greek scientists, like most pioneers in every field, did 
not succeed in proving or in gaining the universal ac- 
ceptance of any of their major theories. Yet they made 
progress in discovering the real problems of science and 
in suggesting the kinds of concepts by which those prob- 
lems might be solved. Perhaps we shall find a some- 
what similar situation in the field of ethics. 
The conflict between the ideals of individualism and 
of collectivism is the particular issue which we have 
chosen for our experiment. The statement of this con- 
flict has been foreshadowed in the introductory section; 
in the section which follows a more definite, though still 
provisional account of it will be offered.
-P-A-G-E-316
  308 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
Section 2. Individualism vs. Collectivism 
Every one is aware of a distinction between what he is 
permitted by society to do and what he is not permitted 
to do, and almost every one meets some situations in 
which he thinks it would be better from some points of 
view to do what he is not permitted to do. For in- 
stance, a man may think it better not to pay a tax main- 
taining armaments, but the law requires him to pay it. 
The individualist is one who is impressed by the fre- 
quency and harmfulness of these dilemmas, and who, 
therefore, regards control by law or by public opinion 
as at best a necessary evil which should be reduced to 
the minimum possible. The collectivist, on the other 
hand, believes that either from incapacity to judge of his 
own welfare or natural indifference to the welfare of 
others, or else for the sake of greater social efficiency, 
the individual requires guidance and control, and that 
extension of such control wherever it can be made ef- 
fective is advisable. 
I. THE CASE FOR INDIVIDUALISM 
In the course of controversy it becomes necessary for 
both parties to state their ideals more explicitly. Indi- 
vidualism, if pushed to the logical extreme, would deny 
the justification of any social control whatever. We 
need not, however, pause for a discussion of a theory of 
anarchy in morals. It is not seriously maintained by 
any one that we ought all to do what happens to please 
us irrespective of its effect on any one else; in other 
words, that there are no such things as obligations. 
For better or for worse, we are social beings, and unless 
we are prepared to feed, shelter, and clothe ourselves
-P-A-G-E-317
  REFLECTION IN ETHICS 309 
without help from anybody, and to limit our conversa- 
tion to soliloquy, we must pay due regard to the conven- 
tions which make associated activities possible. Since 
we cannot live, or at least get more than a small fraction 
of the things we wish, without the services of our fellow 
men, we must offer a return for such services; and this 
consideration, in the individualist’s opinion, both justifies 
and defines our obligations. Our bargain is within lim- 
its a good bargain, but we are obliged to make a return 
only for value received, and if we yield more we are al- 
lowing ourselves to be imposed upon and deprived of 
our rights. Correspondingly, we are entitled to ask of 
others only such deference to our wishes as we have 
earned by deference to theirs, and we are usurping au- 
thority that belongs rightly to them if we seek to control 
any of their actions or preferences that do not affect the 
fulfillment of our desires. 
Such considerations are equally applicable to our 
private and to our public activities. Certain of our acts 
affect gravely the welfare of others, and for control of 
these the state exists, of which the characteristic feature 
is the power to use compulsion. Its réle is limited to the 
preservation of our security; externally, to defense 
against aggression on the part of other nations; inter- 
nally, against attack by other individuals. An ideal 
state in an ideal world would have no other functions 
than the maintenance of order and the enforcement of 
contracts. We ought to be compelled, that is to say, to 
do no more than respect the rights of others and dis- 
charge such obligations to them as we have contracted 
for. The state may tax us for the support of the judge, 
the policeman, and the soldier, but for nothing else. 
The general distinction which the individualist draws 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
  310 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
is thus between acts which affect ourselves only, and 
those which affect others, and he is prepared to admit 
interference, by the state or by public opinion, only 
with the latter. This conclusion is reinforced by two 
sets of arguments, the first drawn from a study of com- 
parative ethics, the latter from the results of compulsion 
on the character and usefulness of those subjected to it. 
If we consider the codes under which people live and 
have lived, we find a vast number of conflicting ideas, 
along with a certain amount of agreement. All civilized 
states maintain for their citizens a reasonable measure of 
security: they protect the lives and property of those 
who come under the jurisdiction of their laws. In ad- 
dition, however, they impose restrictions and exact du- 
ties which vary from state to state, no one of which, 
therefore, is essential to the existence of a stable com- 
munity. Public opinion, going beyond this, adds to the 
burden. Individuals are obliged not only to respect the 
rights of others, as they ought to be: they are compelled 
to order their private affairs in accordance with the ideas 
of the majority of their fellow citizens; and this is wholly 
unjustifiable. If we go further afield and consider the 
moral codes of primitive peoples, we find that the sav- 
age is subjected to innumerable prohibitions or tabus for 
which no utility can be found. ‘His whole life, to its 
minutest detail, is ordained for him by the voice of the 
herd, and he must not, under the most dreadful sanc- 
tions, step outside its elaborate order.” ! Whom he may 
marry, what he must wear, how he must conduct him- 
self in the presence of his superiors, his inferiors, and his 
equals, are matters rigidly determined by the custom of 
his tribe. We find, in other words, that men in associa- 
1 Trotter, Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War.
-P-A-G-E-319
  REFLECTION IN ETHICS 311 
tion, whether through legal or extra-legal means, con- 
stantly tend to interfere with actions on the part of their 
fellows that have no bearing on the proper concerns of 
the state; that authority is naturally disposed to be 
tyrannical, to meddle, and to enjoin upon the individual 
behavior inimical to his own welfare. 
If we compare the life of civilized communities, in 
which the individual has won at least a measure of free- 
dom from control, with that of the savages, where custom 
is all-powerful and brooks no exceptions, we find that 
it is only in the former that there is any trace of what 
we call “‘individuality.”’ In the absence of this character- 
istic, it would hardly be too much to say, there can be 
nothing of real value. People are only happy in their own 
lives, or of interest in the lives of others, in so far as they 
are at liberty to develop in their own peculiar fashion, 
to display their distinctive gifts and become unique per- 
sonalities. But compulsion, the individualist contends, 
is in its nature repressive; it forces those affected by it 
into a stereotyped mould, and allows no play whatever 
for individuality. A rich variety of types is not only 
more valuable from an esthetic point of view; it is also 
more effective practically. A state has many and va- 
ried problems to solve, and requires in consequence ex- 
tensive resources in human material to draw upon: if all 
people are alike, there can be no specialized functions, as 
there are none, or almost none, among savages. What 
is done under compulsion, furthermore, is badly done. 
A man acts effectively, as a rule, only when he is doing 
what he likes, when he is free to act or not to act accord- 
ing to his pleasure. Hence the superiority of private 
initiative to governmental direction. We secure spon- 
taneity, inventiveness, resourcefulness, in a word, effec-
-P-A-G-E-320
  312 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
tiveness, in every field of activity, only when we let peo- 
ple alone, permit them to do as they please. Hence that 
government and that public opinion is best that governs 
least: authority is always to be distrusted, and the eter- 
nal vigilance on the individual’s part in scrutinizing law 
and convention is the price of liberty and happiness. 
This argument, if it is justified, yields an ethical con- 
clusion of general validity. It supplies us with a test 
for deciding which of the acts prescribed by society and 
the state are justly prescribed, and which are not; it en- 
ables the individual to judge of the extent to which he is 
morally bound to obey the commands of his people. It 
does not, of course, answer every question that may be 
asked about his conduct, since unjust laws may be 
obeyed on the ground of expediency; but it does answer 
an important part of the moral question in a way equally 
valid for allmen. Nor, it must be added, does any sci- 
ence answer questions of practice in a final or conclusive 
manner. The most perfectly trained physician may err 
in the diagnosis or treatment of a case: the application 
of his knowledge may in a concrete instance always go 
astray. Universal validity, which is characteristic of 
the sciences, does not involve absolute finality or abso- 
lute certainty in application. The absence of these in 
our present state of ethical knowledge is, therefore, no 
bar to the inclusion of ethics among the sciences if it 
can furnish us with laws that may be both proved and 
applied to concrete cases to the same extent, as for ex- 
ample, the principles of medicine. Such, it is alleged, 
is the general statement that the individual owes only 
such services as society has earned by assuring his se- 
curity, with the corollary that the degree of compulsion 
exerted by society far oversteps this limit, and ought to
-P-A-G-E-321
REFLECTION IN ETHICS ' $18 
be resisted until it is reduced to the extent indicated by 
the general principle. This statement is true for every 
individual and for every community; it carries with 
it particular consequences of practical value, and its 
truth and value vindicate the claim of reflective thought ' 
to be applicable to the sphere of conduct. 
We may summarize the contentions of the individual- ° 
ist as follows: Human interests naturally conflict, and 
their conflict can only be resolved by mutual concessions. 
Since we accept others’ concessions, we are in duty 
bound to make concessions ourselves. By living in so- 
ciety, we tacitly accept the ‘‘social contract,”’ the obli- 
gations of which society may with justice compel us to 
discharge. Over such of our acts as affect only our- 
selves, society has no jurisdiction, and if it attempts to 
control them it ought to be resisted. If it is well ad- 
vised, it will make no such attempt, since we are not 
only happier, but also more valuable to it if we are left, 
subject to the above reservation, to do as we please. 
II, THE CASE FOR COLLECTIVISM 
Criticism of the above argument begins by making 
explicit the assumptions underlying it. It takes for 
granted, first, that actions may be divided into those af- 
fecting only the agent, and those affecting also his fel- 
lows; second, that there is a natural and essential con- 
flict between the interests of different individuals, such 
that compulsion exerted upon one man in the interests 
of others or of society as a whole is necessarily abridg- 
ment of the freedom of the individual coerced; finally, 
that every one knows what he wishes, is the best judge 
of what will satisfy his desires. All these assumptions 
may be denied, and the collectivist does deny them all.
-P-A-G-E-322
  314 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
He asserts, in contrast, that all our desires and acts are 
indissolubly bound up with one another, and that if any 
of them are society’s concern, all of them are. The 
state may set a norm for private as well as public life, 
exercise a positive as well as a negative function. If it 
is objected that this opens the way to unlimited exploi- 
tation of the individual in the interests of society, the re- 
ply is that no opposition exists between the interests of 
the two: society is not an external means to the ends of 
the individual, but we are in all literalness ‘‘members 
one of another.” The welfare of society is directly and 
immediately a part of the individual’s welfare, for with- 
out his relations to others he would not be even an indi- 
vidual. Finally, if the individualist contends that com- 
pulsion is still unjustified, since to the extent that the 
welfare of the man and the State are one no compulsion 
is needed, the collectivist replies that the individual does 
not, in the beginning, know his own welfare. What he 
supposes himself to desire is in many cases utterly un- 
satisfactory to him when he gets it, and what appears 
compulsion and the negation of liberty is really a direc- 
tion of his energies into channels that have in the past 
been proved to lead to a real goal, and not to some il- 
lusory Utopia. When any one wishes anything contrary 
to what the law permits him, the argument runs, he 
may be sure that the end he has in view would not 
satisfy him if he could reach it. At best it could be had 
only at the sacrifice of some greater good which in his 
ignorance he has overlooked. True freedom and obedi- 
ence to law are not, consequently, opposed, for law, 
when positive as when negative, interprets to each man 
his own will, and when he hearkens to it he hears the 
voice of his own best self.

  REFLECTION IN ETHICS 815 
The first point is one easily made. The individualist 
was unwilling to allow the state to compel or supervise 
education, to forbid the use of alcohol or drugs, to look 
after the health of the personal tastes of its people, be- 
cause these things relate to the private life, and have 
nothing to do with the discharge of one’s obligations to 
others. They have, however, much to do with the ade- 
quate discharge of such obligations, and the social wel- 
fare as a whole. Illiteracy, addiction to drugs, and in 
general a low level of culture and intelligence are inju- 
rious to each and all, and in preventing them to the ut- 
most possible extent it is the claim of the collectivist that 
the state is increasing and not diminishing freedom. It 
is possible to be a slave to superstition, ignorance, ill- 
health, and vice, and the compulsion exerted by the 
state and public opinion to prevent these conditions riv- 
ets no fetters upon the individual, but rather breaks 
them. Abstract freedom of contract may in practice 
turn out to be servitude, none the less real because it is 
enforced by the “invisible lash of hunger.” Liberty, in 
the only real sense, is something that must be assured 
by legislation, not by merely leaving the individual 
alone. 
This conviction is deepened if we consider, not the 
conditions under which we can secure our ends, but the 
ends themselves. The individualist considers associa- 
tion between individuals as merely incidental to the ac- 
quisition by each of the things he wishes to enjoy, and 
the services he renders to society as always a subtrac- 
tion from his total enjoyment. But if there were no so- 
ciety, no other persons in the world, the individual 
would be nothing, or at least there would be nothing to 
characterize him as a human being. He would have no
-P-A-G-E-324
  316 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
interests to make his own, nothing to enlist his energies 
and provide an end in the achievement of which he 
could find his satisfaction. Vocationless, companion- 
less, with nothing to do but find food and shelter him- 
self from the elements, he would be precisely on a par 
with the animals. If individualism were true, a man 
living alone on an island would enjoy the most complete 
freedom, a conclusion which reduces individualism to 
absurdity. A freedom which turns out to mean free- 
dom from all our deepest interests can hardly be distin- 
guished from slavery. How is our man without a fellow 
different from a man undergoing solitary imprisonment? 
If we take into account the social nature of man, then, 
his duties appear in a very different light. The actions 
exacted from him apparently in the interests of others 
are in reality in his own interests. The welfare of the 
social organism is his welfare, its injuries his injuries, 
and its destruction his destruction. The murderer not 
only sets an example and authorizes a practice of which 
he may be the next victim; he, also, whether discovered 
or not, confirms himself in the isolation which is harder 
than any other penalty to bear. The liar, if he is found 
out, cannot expect thereafter to have what he says be- 
lieved, but what is worse for him is that he cannot him- 
self believe others. A trivial example may illustrate the 
general principle. We may consider the rules of a game 
as intended to safeguard the interests of all playing it, as 
compelling each to give consideration to the claims of 
his opponents. On the individualistic view, I am re- 
strained from cheating because unfair play would rob 
another of a deserved victory. The truth is that a 
game won unfairly is not won at all: it is I who am de- 
prived of the victory, for I know, whether others know 
 
-P-A-G-E-325
  REFLECTION IN ETHICS 317 
it or not, that the outcome did not reveal the best 
player. Law once more appears as the expression of 
my own will, and what it demands of me is what I truly 
wish to do. 
The final argument for collectivism has been stated 
by implication in what has gone before. The individu- 
alist assumes that every man knows what he wants, but 
so far is this from the truth that we might with equal 
propriety say that no man knows what he wants. 
There is no one who, looking back into his past, cannot 
remember desires without number the satisfaction of 
which he now thanks heaven was denied him. The 
truth contained in the epigram, “‘There are two trage- 
dies in life, not getting what one wants, and getting it; 
and the second is by far the worse,” may be only a half- 
truth, but the individualist forgets it entirely. If we 
are capable of being educated at all, we soon learn to dis- 
tinguish between our real selves and our momentary, im- 
pulsive, or unenlightened selves. Few of us are so for- 
tunate as never to have had to say, “I was not myself 
when I did that.”” What we think we want at any mo- 
ment is therefore no index to our real needs, and society, 
in compelling us to forego many satisfactions to which 
we feel ourselves drawn, is really enforcing the claims of 
our own enlightened will. This statement is, indeed, 
only a summary of the arguments already set forth: the 
social will is really our will, and it is only our own blind- 
ness that can persuade us to the contrary. 
All these facts point to one conclusion. The individ- 
ual, apart from the state of which he is a member, is 
nothing: he owes to the state, in consequence, his abso- 
lute and unconditional loyalty. He is most fully him- 
self when he accepts the duties the state assigns him,
-P-A-G-E-326
  318 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
knowing that its life is his, and that the hardships it 
seems to impose upon him are no more than every one 
submits to who restrains the impulses of the moment be- 
cause they conflict with some greater ultimate good. 
Our moral duty is near at hand and unmistakable: it 
consists in discharging the duties of our station, and 
living in accord with the spirit of our people. Though 
every age and every nation has its own set of laws and 
traditions, and these are not all the same, we must not 
suppose them, therefore, to be in error; each is justified 
in its own time and place; and the individual cannot do 
better than to make those of his state his own. 
III, AN ATTEMPTED SYNTHESIS OF THE CONFLICTING 
VIEWS: REDEFINITION AND CLARIFICATION 
OF THE ISSUE 
This conclusion, so diametrically opposed to that 
reached in the preceding section, may seem to throw us 
back into the arms of the skeptic. He appears to be 
right who says that where good and bad are concerned 
there can be nothing but opinions; you may take your 
choice, for no opinion can be proved. Perhaps, how- 
ever, the disagreement may not be so absolute as our 
first impression suggests: a criticism of both arguments 
may reveal at least a measure of concord. 
If we admit the contention of the collectivist, that his 
opponent misconceived the nature of the individual, 
falsely opposed the individual’s welfare to the welfare of 
society, and understood liberty, consequently, in too 
narrow a sense, we may still hesitate to accept his con- 
clusion that no individual is ever justified in taking issue 
with the moral code under which he lives. As against 
an individualism which identifies freedom with the abil- 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
  REFLECTION IN ETHICS 319 
ity to disregard others entirely, except as means to our 
ends, it must be admitted that relations to others are 
part of the essence of the individual, and that action in 
their interest cannot be regarded as necessarily involv- 
ing self-sacrifice on his part. It is doubtless true also 
that we learn what we want only gradually, and that if 
we had no society to instruct us — partly at least by 
compulsion — we should never learn. But when all 
this is conceded, we may still feel reluctant to admit the 
claim that the world is always wiser than any man, and 
entitled, therefore, to demand absolute obedience from 
all. This reluctance may be defended on at least two 
grounds, one, furnished by the answer to the question 
how far the state does actually offer perfect satisfaction 
to the wishes of every one, provided he learns to know 
what his true wishes are; the other, furnished by a con- 
sideration of the history of moral progress. 
Critics of the theory of the all-wise and all-powerful 
state invariably urge that that theory considers the 
state in its ideal form; finds that a perfect state would 
supply the individual with opportunities precisely ad- 
justed to his powers, that it would provide him with bet- 
ter instruments for the solution of his problems than any 
he could possibly find by his own unaided efforts; and 
that the theory then attributes these qualities to the 
existent state and claims for this state the allegiance due 
only to the perfect community. A state in which perfect 
justice and perfect wisdom were the rule could, it may 
be, be permitted to determine absolutely the duties of its 
citizens, reveal to them their real will, and claim their 
obedience with no appeal to any other quarter. But 
the state as it actually exists is a set of institutions which 
have gradually developed from forms that no one would  
-P-A-G-E-328
| | 
320 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
now consider perfect, and the traces of this ancestry 
have by no means disappeared. The position of woman 
in the family, for instance, has always been determined 
in a large measure by the fact that she was once a chat- 
tel, a part of her husband’s possessions, to be regarded 
as permanently and essentially his inferior. This is the 
status that, if we take into consideration the past and 
by far the greater part of the world at present, has, in an 
overwhelmingly high degree, been assigned her by law 
and public opinion. No doubt in an ideal marriage the 
nominal possession of authority by either husband or 
wife would be a matter of indifference, since the desires of 
each would aim at nothing contrary to the welfare of the 
other. However, the conditions with which we are con- 
fronted are real and not ideal conditions, and under 
them we are not justified in expecting from fallible hu- 
man beings the perfect insight, justice, and self-control 
that should be characteristic of any one wielding abso- 
lute authority. It may make a great deal of difference 
to a woman that she does or does not retain title to her 
property after she marries. And, in general, the will of 
the state is always exercised through individuals. It is 
only by a figure of speech that we can talk of the state’s 
creating or regulating institutions. Actually, it is the 
individuals holding office who pass legislation and ad- 
minister justice, and few will be found to maintain that 
legislatures and parliaments and their ministers always 
know better than the individuals for whom they legis- 
late what is for the best interests of those individuals. 
When by the fortunes of war Alsace and Lorraine were 
added to the German Empire, it is not immediately ob- 
vious that their inhabitants had no real will but to re- 
nounce their allegiance to France, or that in England in
-P-A-G-E-329
  REFLECTION IN ETHICS 321 
the eighteenth century, when theft of any article exceed- 
ing five shillings in value was punishable by death, the 
criminal who paid that penalty agreed in putting so high 
an estimate on the debt he owed society. 
Similarly, when we consider the history of progress as 
a whole, we find that everything now considered an ad- 
vance was fiercely contested by law and public opinion 
at the time it was first proposed, and that he who ad- 
vances beyond the moral standards of his time is in the 
eyes of his contemporaries as much a criminal as he who 
lags behind. The circumstance already mentioned, that 
every possible pressure is brought to bear upon each in- 
dividual, at the time when he is most susceptible to sug- 
gestion, and least capable of criticizing it, to make him 
accept the moral standards current in his community, 
justified suspicion of any blanket endorsement of things 
as they are in the moral world. In general, we may say 
that the collectivist argument, if at any time in the past 
it had been accepted in its entirety and acted upon, 
would at that moment have brought progress to an end. 
Every great advance has been the work of individuals 
who entertained beliefs at variance with the accepted 
code of their time, and had the courage to act upon 
them. Socrates and Jesus are the stock examples; and 
if any one chooses to say, as has been said, that the con- 
servative is the imitator of the dead radical, it is not al- 
together clear with what words he is to be answered. 
An individualism which takes its stand on the forego- 
ing considerations thus escapes the force of the collecti- 
vist polemic. It may grant that freedom is opportunity 
to strive for a more than personal end in an ordered so- 
cial world, and at the same time contend that the indi- 
vidual may not only select, but to some extent create, 
 
-P-A-G-E-330
822 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
the ideals to which he yields allegiance. Again, though 
he does not know at the start, and indeed never com- 
pletely knows, what his own will is, and though society 
through its laws and institutions does much to teach 
him, there is no law and no institution which was not 
hammered into its present form out of a more imperfect 
form, no change which was not resisted by the collectiv- 
ists of an earlier day. If the word “tradition” be used 
to cover the whole heritage of the past by which we are 
directed into fruitful and significant ways of living, the 
individualist of whom we are at present speaking can 
say of it, as has been said of so many things, that it is 
a good servant but a bad master. As an instrument 
its value cannot be overestimated, but its value is instru- 
mental, and when made into an end in itself, when with- 
drawn from constant criticism and reconstruction, it at 
once becomes an engine of enslavement. And since 
it is in response to the desires of individuals that the 
testing and reconstruction goes on, the center of gravity 
remains in the man and not in society. 
Section 8. Results of the Controversy 
Has the foregoing controversy brought us further 
than we were when we started? The ethical skeptic 
may appear to have the last word, since neither of the 
disputants seems able thoroughly to prove his case, nor 
have they advanced to any third position upon which 
they are in complete agreement. Nevertheless, a 
change in the arguments advanced for individualism 
and collectivism has come about through the discussion. 
The attention of each party has been drawn to values in 
its opponent’s position, and in a measure each party has 
tried to incorporate these values of its opponent’s view
-P-A-G-E-331
  REFLECTION IN ETHICS 823 
into its own position. Thus, the individualist is forced 
to recognize that men must codperate in order to live, 
and that individuals are after all in large degree social 
products. What he now holds out for is that certain 
kinds of variation and liberty are highly desirable, and 
he sees that the next step in the development of his po- 
sition is to make clear to himself and to others what 
kinds of variation and liberty these are, and under what 
conditions they can be best secured. The collectivist, 
on the other hand, sees that groups are growing, devel- 
oping things, not given as perfect, and that individual 
variation is in part the manner by which they grow. In 
the light of this discovery he will now be apt to consider 
what kinds of group regulation best insure those values 
which he originally desired and those of which the indi- 
vidualist has made him cognizant. 
From a consideration of this instance we may draw 
some general conclusions as to the kind of progress pos- 
sible through reflection in ethics. In the first place, re- 
flection brings to our attention values which we might 
otherwise overlook. Secondly, reflection leads us to a 
better understanding of ourselves, to a defining of our 
real aims, a clarification of our desires. If we still find 
ourselves in disagreement with others, it is nevertheless 
satisfying to see more clearly the reasons why. Plato’s 
Dialogues, Aristotle’s Ethics, the Hebrew Prophets, the 
Meditations of Marcus Aurelius are regarded as great 
monuments in the field of ethics just as are the works of 
Copernicus and Newton and Darwin in science. These 
ethical classics are in many ways conflicting in their 
points of view, and there is no method of detecting 
which is better as in science. In calling them all clas- 
sics we mean to recognize more than their literary excel-
-P-A-G-E-332
324 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
lence, however; we mean that each has thought through 
toits foundations some genuine desire of man, express- 
ing it, therefore, truly, ‘‘as a possession forever.”’ This 
is the kind of clarification which reflection introduces 
into ethics. 
A third value which reflection brings in ethics arises 
from this clarification of ideals. By banishing vague- 
ness, revealing new facts, and so on, it makes us see 
what problems really are most vital, and thus brings us 
nearer to actual solutions. Asin the example cited, the 
individualist and the collectivist are both brought to 
realize that they must determine what kinds of individ- 
ual variation and of social regulation they consider ad- 
visable, and under what conditions. 
A fourth result of reflection in ethics is to make our 
conduct more fully our own, more voluntary and less of 
a blind obedience to custom. It seems more human to 
know why one is doing what he is doing. When asked 
what good his philosophy did him, Aristotle is reported 
to have said that because of it he did voluntarily what 
other men do only for fear of the law. Socrates, if asked 
the same question, might have answered that, because 
of it he did what other men, for fear of the law, dared 
not do. 
Reflection on morals may never lead us to a general 
agreement on fundamental standards. It may be 
doubted whether such agreement, if it could be reached, 
would really be desirable. But reflection can at least 
make us cognizant of ideals different from our own, and 
this will lead us in some cases to assimilate the values of 
other positions, thus producing a greater agreement 
among men than would otherwise exist. But even 
where this is not the case, and wide differences in desire 
 
-P-A-G-E-333
REFLECTION IN ETHICS 825 
continue to exist, nevertheless, the very attempt to un- 
derstand desires different from one’s own often provides 
a basis for better codperation in matters not affected by 
the difference, and thus for living together with more 
profit and understanding and happiness. 
Taking all these factors into consideration, we arrive 
at a test of good reflective thinking in ethics. From 
blind adherence to a vaguely understood principle, it 
should bring us to the voluntary adoption of a clearer 
standard, more intelligible to ourselves and to others, 
including those who disagree; a standard based upon a 
consideration of more facts, and one which leads us 
more directly to deal with the real problems confront- 
ing us. 
Section 4. The Evaluation of Character 
Thus far we have considered only reflection upon 
standards of conduct. Every one is familiar from daily 
experience with the distinction between character and 
conduct, between what a man does and what he is, 
though there is no general agreement as to the exact re- 
lation between the two. Every one also agrees that we 
should judge a man’s character from a fair sampling of 
his conduct, but people differ in their ideas as to what 
such a fair sampling would be. Some think that we 
should give chief weight, if not exclusive weight, to his 
motives, to what he wants to accomplish, and the spirit 
with which he attempts it, since what he actually does 
accomplish depends so much on circumstances outside of 
his control. ‘‘There is nothing absolutely good in the 
world,” writes Kant, ‘‘save a good will.” On the other 
hand, it is urged that efficiency and capacity are virtues 
which must be counted in estimating character, so that  
-P-A-G-E-334
  826 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
it is not only a man’s motives, but also his success, which 
must be measured. 
Without undertaking to settle these disputes, we may 
distinguish three different kinds of character evalu- 
ation, which are supplementary rather than mutually 
exclusive. Each is designed to serve a different pur- 
pose, and the results of all three would have to be con- 
sidered in forming a total estimate of any one’s entire 
character. In the first place, there is the judging of a 
person’s spirit, his motives and intentions, his sensitiv- 
ity, the fineness of his feelings, andsoon. These things 
are revealed in considerable measure through a person’s 
outward acts, but never entirely so. We say we know 
a person well or intimately when we are able to sense 
these inward factors immediately in a rather subtle, in- 
tuitive fashion. Of very different sort is the appraisal 
of a person’s fitness to perform certain specific func- 
tions. Here objective measurement is often possible if 
we can define the function exactly enough and devise a 
test that gauges just those qualities demanded by this 
function. The tests devised during the World War 
to measure potential aviators were tests of this kind. 
Finally, there is a kind of character evaluation which 
attempts to estimate the whole person taking into con- 
sideration all factors. This is of all kinds the most 
difficult, for the thing to be measured is very complex, 
containing factors incommensurable with each other, 
and the standard by which we measure, our conception 
of what the person ought to be, is apt to be either very 
arbitrary or else indefinite and vague. 
All manner of difficult problems arise out of this at- 
tempt to evaluate human character. To what common 
standards should every person in a given group be held,
-P-A-G-E-335
REFLECTION IN ETHICS 827 
and in what respects is the ideal self, if there be such a 
thing, unique for every individual? Furthermore, sup- 
pose that some individuals are vile and evil in our eyes, 
entirely unsatisfactory when measured by our notions 
of human excellence, do we not, in spite of this, recog- 
nize some worth in them by virtue of their very human- 
ity? What kind of worth is this? 
These are some of the more ultimate problems in eth- 
ical philosophy which cannot be treated here. 
Section 5. The Practical Aim of Ethics 
Reflection in ethics is intended to secure, not merely 
the knowledge of what is good, but rather the increased 
practice of it, the actual living well. In this endeavor 
the clarification and improvement of ideals, which we 
have been discussing in this chapter, is only one factor. 
What people do badly they do badly not only because 
their standards are poor, but perhaps even more fre- 
quently because they do not know how to live up to 
their standards. To know wherein efficiency and kind- 
ness consist does not prevent us from becoming tired 
and irritable. 
Persistent failure to achieve a standard may raise 
two questions. Is the standard a good one? How 
might one realize it? These two questions are not un- 
related. Some people hold that standards are proved 
bad if the conditions for their realization cannot be de- 
vised. The really good must be an actually attainable 
good. Not so, say others. If an end, e.g., immortality, 
is good, it is no less good for being perhaps impossible. 
However wide and full of consequences this disagree- 
ment on the nature of standards may be, both dispu- 
tants are likely to agree that human morality has suf- 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
  328 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
fered from an excess of condemnations and approvals, 
coupled with a lack of practical invention. It is much 
easier to blame a person for falling short of a certain 
standard than to suggest how he might have attained it. 
And the actual attaining may be harder still. If ethics 
is taken seriously as concerned with the actual improve- 
ment of life, it will be no isolated inquiry into standards 
merely, but reflection will pass from it into other de- 
partments of knowledge, into psychology, and politics, 
and economics, and the natural sciences, gathering from 
the whole realm of man’s experience the materials for 
his happiness. 
QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES 
1. In what way does the training in morals provided for the young 
differ from the corresponding education in science or literature? 
What consequences result from this difference? 
2. The moral life, on any view, involves self-denial. What is the 
justification alleged for this self-denial (a) by the individualist, (b) 
by the collectivist? 
3. The individualist contends that constraint causes loss of individu- 
ality. (a) If this is understood to mean that those who are re- 
sponsive to the control of tradition tend to be cast in a stereotyped 
mold — do you think that the facts bear out the statement? (b) 
Do the “conventions” in auction bridge diminish or increase the 
freedom of the player who observes them? 
4. Under what circumstances is “the man versus the state” a real 
issue? 
5. In the course of the argument in the foregoing chapter, the transi- 
tion has been given from an extreme individualistic to an extreme 
collectivistic position, and thence to one intended as a compromise 
between the two. In the course of the argument, how have the 
following terms altered in meaning: (a) the individual, (b) the state 
or society, (c) the other members of society, (d) freedom? 
6. What is meant by an ideal or ultimate standard of conduct? De- 
scribe three such ideals which are held to-day. 
7. Show how each of these ideals would affect the solution of some 
specific moral problem. 
8. What are the uses and limitations of reflection in evaluation? 
Illustrate by reference to the problem discussed above.
-P-A-G-E-337
  
REFLECTION IN ETHICS 829 
9. How is the evaluation of conduct related to the evaluation of 
character? 
10. Give an example of failure to solve a moral problem due to in- 
adequate ideals, and one where it is due to failure to live up to an 
ideal. How might each kind of deficiency be corrected? 
11. How can conflicts between people as to ultimate ideals be resolved?

CHAPTER XIII 
SUMMARY 
Section 1. The Modern Consciousness of Science 
Most of us who live in the civilized nations of to-day 
know that there is such a thing as science. We are very 
conscious, indeed, of its great practical achievements in 
the cure of disease, and in creating those instruments of 
commerce and industry which chiefly distinguish mod- 
ern life from the life of earlier times. It is not only the 
fruits of science, however, of which we are aware, but 
also, in some degree, of the knowledge underlying these 
fruits. We are conscious of possessing much informa- 
tion, and a power of acquiring more, that was unknown 
to other ages. These possessions are an occasion of no 
small pride to us. 
A distinction between ignorance and knowledge, the 
same pride in learning, appears in the literature of all 
times and peoples. But it may be doubted whether any. 
people, save perhaps the ancient Greeks, were as con- 
scious of the possession of science as we are to-day. 
This does not mean, however, that we understand the 
nature of our possession, what knowledge is, how best to 
acquire and to test it. Every schoolboy knows that the 
earth goes round the sun, and he looks upon the Ptole- 
maic theory as superstition; but how many of our adult 
men and women could give adequate reasons for believ- 
ing the Copernican hypothesis? 
The purpose of this book is to help in adding another 
dimension to our consciousness of science, namely, an 
understanding of its processes. If this purpose could be
-P-A-G-E-339

accomplished, we should be much enriched spiritually. 
We should see man and the world in a clearer, fuller 
light. We should also be more critical of whatever is re- 
ported to us, and better prepared to add to our fund of 
tested knowledge. 
Section 2. How are Beliefs to be Tested? 
In the first chapter of this Introduction to Reflective 
Thinking we distinguished such thinking from several 
other types. We contrasted it with the random flow of 
ideas through the mind, with the thinking involved in 
imaginative constructions that are not intended for be- 
lief, and with the uncritical acceptance of beliefs. By 
means of these contrasts certain characteristics of re- 
flective thinking became manifest, and we realized that 
we must look for these characteristics if we would test 
whether any act of thought was reflective or not. 
But, furthermore, it appeared that within the limits 
of reflective thinking we might also distinguish a better 
and a worse. Though the whole enterprise of science 
is reflective, we can recognize a progress in it. Ptole- 
my’s hypothesis was certainly a product of reflective 
thinking. Yet that of Copernicus was better. Thus it 
seemed as if we could get further light upon the tests of 
thought by considering some instances in which old be- 
liefs had given place to new considered better. 
Our method may be clarified by using an analogy. 
Suppose our problem were to find the best of airplane 
motors. We might begin by eliminating from consid- 
eration such motors as were obviously unadapted for 
aerial navigation. The remaining motors would then be 
carefully compared in such respects as weight and speed 
and power. The one selected as the best, by means of
-P-A-G-E-340
  332 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
these comparisons, might be surpassed at any later time 
by one still better. 
Just so, in testing thought, we can begin by separat- 
ing that which is obviously uncritical and unreflective 
from that which is not. Then the remaining beliefs, for 
which there seems to be some critical, reflective founda- 
tion, must be compared with each other, and tested. 
The belief thus selected as the best is not necessarily the 
very best possible belief on the subject, but simply the 
best we have. Sometimes we must make use of hy- 
potheses for which there is no great evidence, simply 
because no one has suggested anything better. 
Some people are intellectually demoralized by the 
spectacle of scientific progress. If beliefs, apparently 
well founded, give place to new, is there anything cer- 
tain? Perhaps not; but is that an adequate reason for 
abandoning the best tests we have to distinguish be- 
tween better and worse beliefs? It is not enough for 
the critic of reflective thinking to show that no certain- 
ties are established thereby; he must suggest a better 
methodology. The fact that serious questions can be 
raised against the proof of every statement does not 
mean that every statement is of equal value. Of 
course, the thoroughgoing philosophic skeptic will reply 
that to challenge him for a better methodology is to beg 
the question. How can one speak of a better when none 
are any good? Why seek a better lifeboat to drown in? 
The only answer to this position seems to be to show 
the skeptic that in simple, practical affairs he acts upon 
a distinction between better and worse thinking, which 
he disavows in argument. If reason and experience are 
useful in choosing a cigar, perhaps we can trust them 
in choosing a moral ideal.

  SUMMARY 333 
Section 8. The Tests of Thought 
The real question is not whether reflection has any 
value, it is the question of how it can be made most 
valuable, and this is a question concerning the con- 
crete tests to which it can be put in specific situations. 
In comparing airplane motors, for instance, to deter- 
mine which is best, we must know what features to look 
for. Our conclusions may be wrong, not only because 
of error in applying some test, but also because of failure 
to apply all relevant tests. There may be some quality 
essential to a good motor of which we are not aware. 
Likewise in comparing beliefs we must endeavor to 
test all qualities with respect to which one belief may be 
said to be better than another. Now there has never 
been perfect agreement as to just what qualities are to 
be included in this category. Most people will agree 
that clarity and intelligibility are desirable qualities in 
thought, and that in testing our beliefs we should de- 
termine whether they possess these qualities. On the 
other hand, there is great disagreement as to whether 
such a quality as personal preference for a belief should 
be considered in attempting to measure its value, apart 
from the reasons for which it is preferred. Ina field like 
astronomy the power of certain ideas to enlist personal 
affections of this sort would seem irrelevant to most of 
us. But would it in the field of ethics? 
Some philosophers, like Aristotle, have given system- 
atic accounts of tests which may be applied to determine 
the validity of beliefs. These accounts constitute that 
branch of philosophy which is usually called logic. By 
some, logic is regarded as a completed science; that is, 
they believe all the tests of thought have been discov-
-P-A-G-E-342
334 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
ered. We shall not inquire into this question, but shall 
content ourselves with recalling those important tests 
upon which nearly all logicians are agreed, and which 
are amply illustrated in the examples of reflective think- 
ing discussed in this book. They are as follows: 
1. Clarity. A good belief is unambiguous. We know un- 
mistakably what it means. 
2. Consistency with the facts. A good belief is founded on 
extensive and accurate observation. It is not contra- 
dicted by experience. ERPs ea 
3. Consistency with other other beliefs. There is a presumption 
against a belief that condicts with other beliefs well 
certified by experience. Sometimes, however, it is the 
latter beliefs rather than the former that need to be re- 
vised. 
4. Utility. A good belief is often distinguished by its use- 
fulness in suggesting further good beliefs. 
5. Simplicity. Other things being equal, that belief is best 
which makes fewest assumptions. 
Section 4. The Influence of Subject-Matter upon the 
Tests of Thought 
The use of the above-mentioned tests of thought is not 
confined to any particular subject-matter; we can test 
reflection in any field by these criteria. But the mean- 
ing of these criteria is not exactly the same in every 
field, it varies with the nature of the subject-matter. For 
example, we may speak both of an astronomical law and 
of a child labor law as being in agreement or in conso- 
nance with the facts of experience, but not the same 
kind of agreement will bemeant. In astronomy we mean 
that the law correctly describes a relation obtaining be- 
tween certain phenomena; in legislation we mean that 
considering the facts of the situation the law is likely to 
achieve the desired result.  
-P-A-G-E-343
  SUMMARY 835 
We cannot understand what the criteria of good re- 
flective thinking really mean unless we consider them in 
connection with the subject-matter in which they are 
employed. Also, it appears that the relative impor- 
tance of these criteria is different in different fields. In 
a mathematical system the consistency of one belief 
with another is more important than in a penal code. 
Clarity, unambiguity, is a quality to be desired of 
thought in all fields, and its meaning also is the same in 
all. Whatever the content of a statement may be, 
whether it be mathematical, historical, or juridical, we 
want that content to be understood exactly as we mean 
it. This is essential. One reason why mathematics is 
such an important and universal instrument of thought 
is because of this universal importance of clarity. To 
express an idea in mathematical terms is the most exact 
and unambiguous way of expressing it. If we say that 
A is fairly good in arithmetic, no one knows what is 
meant, except in a very vague way. But if we can say 
that A’s rating on a standardized arithmetical test is 79, 
we get much more definite information. 
Consistency with the facts is also essential to reflective 
thinking in all fields — with possibly one exception, in 
the case of systems designed to develop the implications 
of definitions rather than to describe facts. We may 
construct a system of propositions, each consistent with 
the others, but having no essential relation to observed 
facts. Mathematics is regarded by many as a creation 
of this kind. Its astounding usefulness, its almost uni- 
versal applicability, is not intrinsic to it, but accidental. 
“If mathematics has been the beacon light of the sci- 
ences, it is not the fault of mathematicians,” says one of 
them. The mathematician is concerned to work out
-P-A-G-E-344
  336 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
the relationships between certain ideal entities that hap- 
pen to interest him. If these relationships are found to 
correspond to relationships existing outside the purely 
mathematical realm, in the realm of physical objects, for 
example, the findings of the mathematician can be car- 
ried over into that field, but the correspondence which 
makes this possible was not deliberately sought by him. 
There are some dissenters from this view of mathe- 
matics. They fall into two classes. First, those who in- 
sist that the mathematician does keep one eye on the 
physical world, and that his definitions, axioms, and 
postulates are intentionally relevant to what he sees 
there. A second group holds that, even if the mathema- 
tician keeps both eyes shut to the physical world, he is 
nevertheless compelled by the inner nature of his being 
to think in terms appropriate to that world. A case 
can, therefore, be made on either of these grounds for 
believing that mathematics is really no exception to the 
general rule that reflective thinking may be tested by 
its consistency with fact. 
Certainly this is the test, if any is, in all other fields. 
But by consistency with fact we do not always mean 
the same thing. If a belief purports to describe a situa- 
tion, we say it is consistent with the facts if no signifi- 
cant element in that situation is overlooked or wrongly 
described. On the other hand, if a belief is intended to 
explain a situation — as, for example, the molecular 
theory is intended to explain heat and certain other phe- 
nomena — then we mean by consistency with fact a 
very different thing. We mean that the belief seizes 
upon a certain fact that accounts for the phenomena to 
be explained, makes their behavior intelligible upon a 
single principle, makes them predictable, and some-
-P-A-G-E-345
  
  SUMMARY 337 
times controllable. Again consistency with fact has a 
third meaning when used of a belief that is intended 
neither to describe, nor to explain, but rather to guide 
conduct. A labor law or a practical idea may be said to 
be in agreement with facts if it accurately expresses 
existent desires and proves efficacious in their realiza- 
tion. Thus, the meaning of this important test, con- 
sistency with the facts, depends on whether we are test- 
ing a description, an explanation, or a rule of action. 
Consistency with other beliefs also has various mean- 
ings. It may mean a relation of implication, such that 
one belief cannot be true without another’s being true. 
In some instances, this kind of consistency is demanded. 
For example, A and B cannot be brothers unless they are 
children of the same parents. A second kind of consist- 
ency between beliefs may be described as compatibility 
without implication. As far as we know, the atomic 
theory of matter implies neither the truth nor the falsity 
of the theory of evolution. Each may be held without the 
other, and both may be held together; the evidence for 
each is different without being conflicting. Some phi- 
losophers hold that, if our knowledge of the universe 
could be made complete, all true propositions would be 
shown to imply each other. Whatever position we may 
take on this question, most of us will probably agree at 
least that true propositions will not contradict each 
other. 
We can tell by an analysis of their meaning whether 
propositions imply each other or contradict each other. 
Logicians have devised ingenious tables showing how 
one statement qualifies others. But implication and 
compatibility are not the only senses in which we speak 
of consistency between beliefs. Sometimes we mean
-P-A-G-E-346
338 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
not that one belief implies another, or that it is merely 
compatible with another, but rather that one belief in- 
creases the probability that another belief is true. Thus, 
for example, the belief that the earth is much more than 
six thousand years old does not imply the theory of evo- 
lution. On the other hand, it is something more than 
compatible with that theory; it increases the value of 
the evidence for it by making the explanations of evolu- 
tion more feasible. 
Finally, there is a sense in which consistency between 
beliefs means only that it is psychologically possible for 
the same person to hold the various beliefs in question. 
For instance, it is possible for the same person to believe 
that clemency is good, and yet also bad, at least some- 
times. Of course, there may be no logical conflict be- 
tween these two views, since the instances in which 
clemency is believed to be good may be a different set 
from those in which it is regarded bad. But if the in- 
dividual can give no criterion for distinguishing clearly 
these two sets of instances, he is obliged to carry two ap- 
parently conflicting beliefs. Furthermore, the conflict 
is intensified if, as sometimes happens, he regards clem- 
ency as both good and bad in the same instance, but is 
unable to decide whether the respects in which it is good 
outweigh those in which it is bad, or vice versa. Some 
people would say that the psychological possibility of 
holding two beliefs is not at all what is meant when we 
use the consistency of beliefs with each other as a test of 
their validity. If logical compatibility does not obtain 
between the beliefs, the fact that they could be held by 
one person would indicate that he had a poor mind, or 
that he had not solved his problem, rather than that the 
beliefs are both valid. So says one group. Others,
-P-A-G-E-347
, 
SUMMARY 339 
however, think that in certain fields equally valid judg- 
ments may conflict. We may condemn and praise a 
piece of music for being sentimental. In cases like this 
the only kind of consistency which can be demanded be- 
tween several judgments is the psychological possibility 
of holding them all. It is probably true, however, that 
psychological consistency of this kind is more frequently 
abused to the detriment of science, than wisely used to 
its benefit. 
The kind of consistency which is appropriate be- 
tween beliefs depends upon the nature of the subject- 
matter and the problem. Implication, the strictest 
form of consistency, plays most part in mathematical 
systems, but it appears in all fields. In the natural 
sciences we have a network of beliefs which are all com- 
patible with each other, as far as we know, and which in 
many cases lend support to each other. Thus the more 
general hypotheses, like the theory of evolution, are 
supported by evidence accumulated from many diverse 
fields, and giving rise to a group of beliefs pointing in 
the direction of evolution. In jurisprudence, in morals, 
in esthetics, in all fields involving evaluation, we have 
these three types of consistency among the most tested 
beliefs. But in these fields we also admit as valid some 
judgments which may seem inconsistent with others: 
that is, the only kind of consistency we require of them 
is that we should be psychologically able to accept them 
along with the conflicting judgments. The reason for 
this is that in these fields the primary demand which we 
make of our beliefs is that they be consistent with our de- 
sires, and our desires are proverbially inconsistent and 
conflicting with each other. 
By the utility of a belief is meant the opportunity  
-P-A-G-E-348
340 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
which it affords of predicting further facts, either be- 
cause they are actually implied in it, or because they are 
made probable by it, or simply because they are sug- 
gested by it. In this connection we should remember 
that a belief need not be well substantiated itself in or- 
der to suggest what may prove to be positive facts or 
good hypotheses. False beliefs have often been useful 
in stimulating scientific imagination. The mechanism 
of suggestion (if there is such a mechanism) is still the 
most mysterious and least understood of all things. 
Often we cannot produce the most appropriate ideas at 
will, and the order in which we do think seems to have 
no very discernible pattern. This accounts in part for 
the large give-and-take between all fields of knowledge. 
An idea developed in connection with one subject- 
matter may strike in and prove useful almost anywhere 
else. The interdependence of sciences has been abun- 
dantly illustrated by even the few problems discussed 
in this book. 
Simplicity as a test of belief is frequently misunder- 
stood. Ease or facility in using the belief is not what is 
meant. A “simpler” hypothesis may involve more dif- 
ficult mathematical calculations than one more “‘com- 
plex.” Neither do we mean by simplicity that the be- 
lief can be easily understood. The world described by 
modern science is far more difficult to understand than 
the world pictured in popular superstition. By simplic- 
ity is meant making few assumptions, taking few things 
for granted. Other things being equal, such as consist- 
ency with observed facts, etc., that belief is best which 
requires us to make the fewest suppositions. 
This principle of parsimony, as it is called, used to be 
expressed as late as Newton’s time by saying that ‘‘na-
-P-A-G-E-349
SUMMARY 3841 
ture always takes the simplest course,” or words to that 
elect. Nowadays philosophers usually prefer to regard 
parsimony as a principle of science rather than of na- 
ture. For is it not possible that our best accounts of the 
universe are simplifications of what actually takes place 
there? Might not nature take a very complicated 
course to produce phenomena which we interpret on the 
basis of a few meager ideas — especially since our ob- 
servations may omit very much? 
Section 5. Some Ultimate Problems Concerning 
Knowledge 
Ultimate questions of this sort keep coming up at fre- 
quent points in our study of reflective thinking. A list 
of such questions, raised by the material in this book, 
would include the following: 
1. What justification have we for basing general laws on 
the observation of particular instances? (See Chapter 
IV, p. 94.) 
2. What is the relation between mathematical truths and 
objects observed with the aid of the senses? (See Chap- 
ter V, p. 112.) 
3. Is the principle of parsimony simply a convenience to 
man, or is it a law of nature? (See Chapter III, p. 53.) 
4. In what respects do the methods of evaluation resemble 
those of the natural sciences, and in what respects are 
they different? (See Chapter IX, pp. 230-237.) 
5. What sanction have the tests which we apply to reflec- 
tive thinking? Are all the tests known? What are 
they? (See Chapter XIII, pp. 332-334.) 
6. Some sense-images are discovered to be illusory. Does 
this fact cast doubt upon the validity of all sense-data?! 
1 This problem has not been explicitly raised in any of our chapters, 
but it belongs to this group of ultimate questions. See Descartes, Medi- 
tations, pp. 147-49. 
   
-P-A-G-E-350
342 REFLECTIVE THINKING 
Questions like these as to the nature of knowledge it- 
self, its objects, its extent, and validity, have perplexed 
mankind for ages without ever having been answered to 
the satisfaction of every one. Men who agree in using 
the reflective methods studied in this book do not agree 
in their answers to such ultimate questions concerning 
these methods. Philosophy on its methodological side, 
in logic and epistemology, is concerned with these ques- 
tions. 
The praise of philosophy, as a necessary basis for 
reflective thinking, is a theme on which philosophers 
like to end their books. But Plato admonishes us of a 
better way. In his Republic he describes the philos- 
opher dazzled by a splendid vision of the highest knowl- 
edge. Yet afterward he is reminded of the actual state 
of ignorance among mankind. How weak and power- 
less every mere account of science seems in overcoming 
the tremendous difficulties that stand in the way of 
widespread and thorough reflective thinking! Can talk 
convey an adequate impression to the average man of 
what it means really to test a single dubious fact? Can 
the best of lectures furnish compasses to guide us 
through the clouds of opinions by which we are so 
thickly enveloped in these days? No, practice in abun- 
dance must be added. “‘It is only by doing just acts 
that we become just,” says Aristotle, and likewise only 
by practice in reflection can we become reflective.

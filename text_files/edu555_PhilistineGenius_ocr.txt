  PREFACE 
Wen in 1909 “Philistine and Genius” 
was delivered by me in the form of a 
Commencement address before the Har- 
vard Summer School, my prediction of 
the coming European war storm was re- 
garded by everybody as dream and fancy. 
My best friends and sympathisers thought 
my foreboding unjustified and ill-found- 
ed. I was an alarmist, a Cassandra, when 
I spoke of the coming catastrophe which 
was to shake Europe to its very founda- 
tion. When “Philistine and Genius” was 
published in 1911 the American and 
European press, dealing with the views 
advanced in this little volume, completely

ignored the following warning given by 
me: 
“About the middle of the nineteenth 
century Buckle made the prediction that 
no war was any more to occur among civ- 
ilized nations. Henceforth peace was to 
reign supreme. “The wolf shall dwell with 
the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down 
with the kid; their young ones shall lie 
down together, and the lion shall eat 
straw like the ox. . . . Nations shall beat 
their swords into ploughshares, and their 
spears into pruning hooks. Nations shall 
not lift up swords against nations, nor 
shall they learn war any more. This 
prophecy was rather hasty. We have had 
since the Civil war, the Franco-Prussian 
war, the Spanish-American war, the Boer 
war, the Russo-Japanese war, not count- 
ing the ceaseless wars of extermination 
carried on by civilized nations among the
-P-A-G-E-9
  PREFACE vii 
various semi-civilized and primitive tribes. 
Civilized nations do not as yet beat their 
swords into ploughshares, but keep on in- 
creasing the strength of their ‘armed 
peace,’ and are ready to fight bloody 
battles in the quest of new lands and the 
conquest of new markets. 
“In spite of the Hague conference, con- 
voked by the peace-loving Czar, no other 
age has had such large standing armies 
provided with such costly and efficient 
weapons of execution ready for instant 
use. The red spectre still stalks abroad 
claiming its victims. We still believe in 
the baptism of fire and redemption by 
blood. The dogma of blood redemption 
is still at the basis of our faith, and, con- 
sciously or unconsciously, we brand that 
sacred creed on the minds of the young 
generation.” 
The present European upheaval has
-P-A-G-E-10
  viii PREFACE 
finally disclosed to the impartial observer 
the fearful state of Europe as the final 
outcome of its “armed peace.” Instead of 
realizing the dangers of armed peace or 
of “preparedness,” we are ready to be- 
come a military democracy in which every 
able-bodied man is a soldier or a sailor, 
every child is a scout, and every woman 
a nurse or a munition worker. We are 
anxious to waste our resources on prepar- 
edness rather than on the education of the 
young. We hanker for the greatest navy 
in the world at a cost of several billions 
of dollars. We aspire after a million 
headed, billion armed navy and army. 
We clamor for universal, compulsory, 
military service in which our children 
should be drilled for murder and slaugh- 
ter at the decree of a few autocratic offi- 
cials and officers. We imitate Europe 
slavishly, in spite of the fact that the pol-
-P-A-G-E-11
  PREFACE ix 
icy of preparedness or of “armed peace” 
has kept Europe in a state of turmoil for 
generations, has brought her to the brink 
of ruin, and has plunged her into the most 
cruel and most destructive war ever waged 
by man. 
The recent estimate of Count von Roe- 
dern, Secretary of the Imperial German 
Treasury, puts the total cost of the war 
to date, the end of 1916, for all the bel- 
ligerents, at fifty-nine and a half billions 
of dollars. The Mechanics and Metals 
National Bank of New York City figures 
that seventy-five billion dollars will be 
spent for direct military purposes, if the 
war lasts another year. The enormity of 
that expenditure can only be realized if 
we consider that the total wealth of Great 
Britain and Ireland is eighty-five billions 
cf dollars, that of Germany eighty bil- 
lions, that of France fifty billions, that of
-P-A-G-E-12
  e PREFACE 
Russia forty billions, that of Austria- 
Hungary twenty-five billions, and that of 
Italy twenty billions. Such waste is ap- 
palling! 
According to the figures given by Mr. 
Frank H. Simonds, eighteen and a half 
million casualties, of which deaths make 
up nearly one-quarter, is the toll already 
levied on the fighting men of all the bel- 
ligerent nations by twenty-six months of 
war. More than any other war the pres- 
ent European struggle squanders the 
wealth of empires and sacrifices the lives 
of nations. 
Our social status is a reversion to sav- 
agery of the most degenerate type, an 
atavistic lapse towards the paleolithic and 
eolithic man, only more brutal, on account 
of the greater power for evil possessed by 
modern man. What Hun or Vandal ever 
dreamt of such colossal destruction! The
-P-A-G-E-13
  PREFACE xi 
fame of Attila, Jenghiz Khan, Batu, and 
Tamerlane pales and fades before the 
glory of the Kaiser. In a couple of years 
the aggressive German “Kultur” has 
caused more ruin to humanity than all the 
invasions of the yellow peril in the history 
of mankind. Can we take issue with the 
late Professor Royce of Harvard when 
he declares the German Empire to be “the 
wilful and the deliberate enemy of the 
human race”? 
Some future historian in describing our 
times will place us below the moral level 
of our contemporaries, the Bushman and 
the Hottentot. He may say: “Towards 
the end of the nineteenth and at the begin- 
ning of the twentieth century there took 
place a vast accumulation of wealth, due 
to a rapid development of science and 
practical arts. Instead, however, of im- 
proving their condition, European nations 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  xii PREFACE 
deteriorated morally and _ intellectually. 
“Liberal education gave way to techni- 
cal training. Science served greed. Edu- 
cation became mechanical and military in 
character. The successful banker, the 
greedy usurer, the commonplace store- 
keeper, the mediocre shopkeeper, the phi- 
listine patriotic business man became the 
patterns, the ideals, the guides, and lead- 
ers of commercialized nations. Advertis- 
ing and notoriety became the rage and the 
bane of society. The thinker gave way to 
the tinker, the scientist to the mechanic, 
the artist to the artisan, the genius to the 
philistine. False patriotism of the jingo 
type, controlled and animated by indus- 
trial and commercial interests, became the 
standard of nations. An insane frenzy 
of militarism seized on the minds of na- 
tions. Blind obedience became a virtue. 
“The state enslaved the individual. 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
PREFACE xiii 
Drill and discipline stupefied people. Na- 
tions boasting of scientific efficiency and 
‘kultur’ broke treaties, attacked, de- 
stroyed, deported, enslaved whole popula- 
tions of small, weak, neighboring coun- 
tries. Women and babes were drowned 
like rats in the middle of the ocean. Aero- 
planes and Zeppelins showered explosive 
missiles on defenceless people. For such 
cowardly, inhuman, and diabolical acts the 
miscreants were decorated and honored as 
heroes by their alleged superiors. Man 
could not have fallen to any lower level. 
“The elements of nature were let loose 
for the ruin of nations. Man gloried 
in his devilish, military, inventive power 
of destruction. Professors, carrying high 
the banner of ‘kultur,’ exulted in the de- 
grading, vicious process of training by 
which the individual is hypnotized and 
narcotized into submission to a brutal or-

  xiv PREFACE 
ganization of military junkers, hallowed 
by the name of State. All conception of 
free, individual development was lost 
among the Germanic tribes of Central 
Europe. It was the darkest period in the 
history of mankind. Assaults on coun- 
tries, massacres of nations, deportation of 
populations into slavery for powerful mu- 
nition interests, all such outrages, digni- 
fied by the name of war for the defense of 
the Fatherland, had not their parallel even 
in the most degrading period of the his- 
tory of humanity. Man was crazed with 
the lust of blood, frenzied with rapine and 
slaughter.” 
Such will be the just estimate of our 
times by a future impartial historian. 
‘We possess indeed vast stores of wealth, 
but we have not as yet learned their use. 
Like silly upstarts, we use our wealth for 
dissipation and ruin. Our greed and 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
PREFACE xv 
cruelty seem to grow with our possessions. 
Greed with its army and navy is like the 
Biblical horseleech that “hath two daugh- 
ters crying, ‘Give, give.” Human life, 
man’s genius, we hold in no esteem. We 
sink the value of man in the price of his 
product. We raise the value of stock, but 
lower the worth of man. Our young gen- 
eration is trained by fear into discipline 
and obedience. We suppress the genius 
in the child, raise mediocrity, and cultivate 
the philistine. 
“Obedience and discipline are the main- 
stay of family and school,” told me an 
otherwise intelligent schoolmaster. “I 
control my children with kindness, if pos- 
sible, and if needs be, with force.” The 
child is trained to act not by the light of 
reason, but by the command of superior 
force. The child is ruled by fear! 
As a protection against fear the child  
-P-A-G-E-18
  xvi PREFACE 
learns to be secretive, evasive of truth, and 
cowardly of action. These traits of char- 
acter, acquired in early childhood, become 
basic. The child will never fully rid him- 
self of fear and its distressing conse- 
quences. Fear will stay with him, and 
dog his steps all his life long. 
Fear is one of the most fundamental of 
animal instincts, it is the companion of 
the most primitive impulse of self-preser- 
vation. Once this fear instinct is aroused, 
it grows like an avalanche in its downward 
course. In later life this fear instinct be- 
comes manifested in various ways, giving 
rise to the most distressing nervous and 
mental symptoms. In my medical prac- 
tice, as specialist of nervous and mental 
diseases, I have traced again and again the 
worst forms of maladies to the fear instinct 
aroused in early childhood. 
Training by fear, submission, and obe-
-P-A-G-E-19
PREFACE xvii 
dience opens the door wide to all kinds of 
nervous and mental germs, weakening the 
mental and moral constitution of man. 
Man becomes unreasonable, capricious, 
driven by the impulse of self-preservation 
and by the furies of the fear instinct. The 
impulse of self-preservation with its satel- 
lite the fear instinct becomes predominant 
in character which lacks the stamina of 
sturdiness, frankness, openmindedness 
and independence. 
A person brought up in the school of 
fear and blind obedience lacks steadiness 
of purpose, courage, independence, critical 
judgment, becomes bigoted and intoler- 
ant. He falls an easy prey to the sugges- 
tions of his times and surroundings, suc- 
cumbs to the influence of unscrupulous 
leaders. Such a person lacks mental and 
moral poise, he is wanting in the true cour- 
age of reason, present in the fully devel- 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
    xviii PREFACE 
oped man and woman. He can not with- 
stand the pressure of social opinion, being 
unable to stand by his post in the face of 
threatening social opposition. Ruled by 
fear at home, he is governed by terror in 
society. He is afraid of social punish- 
ment, “of losing face,” as the Chinese say, 
with his neighbors, gossips, circles and 
clubs. He dreads above all the judgment 
of the crowd, and is scared by the jeers and 
ridicule of the mob. Human life interests 
become limited by the narrow horizon of 
a mob-ruled personality. The unceasing 
obedience to the suggestions of the crowd 
weakens and loosens the reasoning and 
moral fibre, reduces the energies of the 
mind to the animal level, controlled by 
self-preservation and fear. 
With reduced and impoverished ener- 
gies, the person, in case of trouble and 
misfortune, is unable to fall back on his
-P-A-G-E-21
PREFACE xix 
inner resources, he falls a prey to worry, 
fear, anxiety, and disease. In other cases 
the intellectual and moral powers are en- 
feebled by the rigid discipline and by the 
course of enforced obedience, the person 
falls a victim to all forms of temptations. 
With no principle to guide him, with no 
will to stay him, the person drifts help- 
lessly on the stream of life. Lured by se- 
ductive sirens, his life is finally wrecked 
on the rocks and reefs of vice, sin, crime, 
and disease. 
Where stumbling on vice, disease, and 
crime is avoided, the person inevitably 
lands on the dull shores of the Lotophagi. 
Ideas and ideals are forgotten and for- 
saken in the routine of animal existence. 
This is the land of Philistinism, a land 
where all human, humane interests, inde- 
pendent thought, and courageous action 
are wanting. Philistines are uncritical,
-P-A-G-E-22
  XxX PREFACE 
unconscious of defects and faults, living in 
the mire of self-contented stupidity and 
mediocrity. They cease to grow mentally 
and morally. Their intellectual and moral 
capacities become paralyzed, atrophied. 
Man becomes the equal of the brute. 
With a philistine education and train- 
ing, man is fit to become one of those un- 
fortunate and pitiful European pawns 
and automata who obey blindly the com- 
mands of their superior officers. Philis- 
tines shoot, stab, poison, pillage, burn, 
outrage, and murder at the command of 
unscrupulous, self-seeking leaders, brutal 
junkers, bloodhounds of empires. 
Brought up in a school of fear, obedi- 
ence, and suggestibility, the philistine, like 
Cain, murders his brother without aim 
and without understanding the full sig- 
nificance of the awful deed. He is no more 
responsible than is the machine gun which
-P-A-G-E-23
  PREFACE Xxi 
he accurately trains and points at his sup- 
posed enemies. Philistines are led to the 
battlefield like cattle to the slaughter 
house. Philistines have no personality, 
no individuality, they are cogs in wheels, 
links in chains of monster mechanisms. 
The philistine, the product of our home 
and school, is suggestible and gullible, he 
is always on the lookout for authority, for 
a leader whom he should worship, by whose 
opinions and conviction he is ready to 
swear, whose command he is ready and 
proud to follow. The philistine is good 
material for mobs, for mental epidemics, 
for religious crazes, and for all kinds of 
hysterical movements in which not reason 
but emotional automatism is in the fore- 
ground. Philistinism, stupidity, and im- 
plicit obedience of a monstrous, efficient 
war machine are intimately interrelated. 
The individual becomes.a private, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
  xxii PREFACE 
nation an army, and the country a 
camp. 
Do we as parents wish to bring up our 
children as soulless, willless machines? Do 
we wish them to be without good judg- 
ment, without personal convictions? Do 
we wish them to be led about like cattle? 
We certainly wish them to be of strong 
nature and sturdy character, able to stand 
by their convictions, able to use their criti- 
cal judgment, able to discriminate the 
right from the wrong, able to love the good 
and avoid the evil. 
In The Psychology of Suggestion, pub- 
lished by me in 1897, I arrive at the con- 
clusion that “Personality is suppressed by 
the rigidity of social organization; the 
cultivated, civilized individual is an auto- 
maton, a mere puppet.” ... Again, 
“Under the enormous weight of the socio- 
static press . . . the personal self sinks,
-P-A-G-E-25
    
         PREFACE xxiii 
the suggestible, subconscious, social, im- 
personal self rises to the surface, gets 
trained and cultivated, and becomes the 
hysterical actor in all the tragedies of 
historical life.” . . . In recent European 
-events the suggestible, social self plays the 
chief réle. 
In the same work I come to the follow- 
ing conclusion: “When social conditions 
are of such a nature as to charge society 
with strong emotional excitement, or when 
institutions dwarf individuality, when 
they arrest personal growth, when they 
hinder the free development and exercise 
of the personal, controlling consciousness, 
then society falls into a hypnoid condi- 
tion, the social mind gets disaggregated. 
The gregarious self begins to move within 
the bosom of the crowd, and becomes 
active; the demon of the demos emerges 
to the surface of social life, and throws
-P-A-G-E-26
  xxiv PREFACE 
the body politic into convulsions of 
demoniac fury.” 
The European horrors, atrocities, and 
brutalities, dignified by the stupefying 
and hypnotizing slogan “Kultur, Pa- 
triotism,” are due to the early training, 
by fear and force, of the individual into 
submission to superior authority. Such 
pernicious training sacrifices the genius 
of the child, the originality of the man, 
to a highly efficient, but brutal and blood- 
thirsty Moloch State. The Kuropean 
war is a mental plague which attacks gi- 
gantic, social aggregates when their ulti- 
mate constituent units, the individuals, 
are deprived of independent thought and 
liberty of decision and action, when men 
are swayed by hypnotizing suggestions 
of “superior leaders” who represent the 
interests not of every individual at his 
best, but of high noble castes and of com-

mercial classes. The organized murder of 
European nations is due to the stifling 
of human genius by the cultivation of 
mob spirit which is the cause of all 
forms of social insanity and mental epi- 
demics. 
In the stifling of the genius of the child 
and the cultivation of the mob spirit 
America does not lag behind Europe. 
Mental epidemics, excited by the fear in- 
stinct and by the impulse of self-preserva- 
tion, are prevalent in the States. As de- 
scribed by me in The Psychology of Sug- 
gestion: “American society oscillates be- 
tween acute financial mania and attacks 
of religious insanity. No sooner is the 
business fever over than the deliriwm 
acutum of religious mania sets in. So- 
ciety is thrown from Scylla into Charyb- 
dis. From the heights of financial specu- 
lation society sinks into the abyss of re-

  Xxxvi PREFACE 
vivalism. American society seems to suf- 
fer from circular insanity.” 
Revivalism, a mental frenzy to which 
the American mob mind is specially prone, 
is a resurrection of Greek Bacchanalia 
and Roman Saturnalia. Revivals are 
emotional debauches, religious orgies. As 
I had pointed out in the same work: “Re- 
vivalism is far more dangerous to the life 
of society than drunkenness... . As a 
sot man falls below the brute; as a revival- 
ist he sinks lower than the sot.” 
If Europe is in violent convulsions of 
war insanity, America suffers from no 
less serious mental maladies,—speculation 
frenzies, revival manias, and preparedness 
plagues. Mental epidemics are ineradi- 
cable afflictions of the highly evolved mob 
spirit characteristic of the philistine. The 
evolution of the philistine is the involu-

I appress myself to you, fathers and 
mothers, and to you, open-minded read- 
ers. I take it for granted that your life- 
work is with you a serious matter and that 
you put forth all your efforts to do your 
best in the walk of life which you have 
chosen. I assume that you want to de- 
velop your energies to the highest effi- 
ciency and bring out the best there is in 
you. I assume that you earnestly wish and 
strive to bring out and develop to the high- 
est efficiency the faculties not only of your 
children, but also those of your friends 
and co-workers with whom you associate 
1

  2 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
in your daily vocation, and that you are 
deeply interested in the education of your 
countrymen and their children, who share 
with you the duties, rights and privileges 
of citizenship. I also assume that as men 
and women of liberal education you are 
not limited to the narrow interests of one 
particular subject, to the exclusion of all © 
else. I assume that you are especially 
interested in the development of person- 
. ality as a whole, the true aim of education. 
I also assume that you realize that what 
is requisite is not some more-routine, not 
more desiccated, quasi-scientific methods 
of educational psychology, not the saw- 
dust of college-pseudagogics and philis- 
tine, normal school-training, but more 
light on the problems of life. What you 
want is not the training of philistines, but 
the education of genius. 
We need more light, more information
-P-A-G-E-35
  PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 3 
on “the problems of life.” Is it not 
too big a phrase to employ? Ona second 
thought, however, I must say that your 
problems are the problems of life. For 
the problems of education are funda- 
mental, they are at the bottom of all vital 
problems. The ancient Greeks were 
aware of it and paid special attention to 
education. In rearing his revolutionary, 
utopian edifice, Plato insists on education 
as the foundation of a new social, moral 
and intellectual life. Plato in his Repub- 
lic makes Socrates tell his interlocutor, 
Adeimantus: “Then you are aware that 
in every work the beginning is the most 
important part, especially in dealing with 
anything young and tender? For that is 
the time when any impression which one 
may desire to communicate is most readily 
stamped and taken.” 
We may say that all man’s struggles,
-P-A-G-E-36
‘5 
4 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
religious, moral and economical, all the 
combats and conflicts that fill the history 
of mankind, can be traced finally to the 
nature and vigor of the desires, beliefs 
and strivings which have been cultivated 
by the social environment in the early life 
of the individual. The character of a na- 
tion is moulded by the nature of its edu- 
cation, The character of society depends 
  on the early training of its constituent 
units. The fatalism, the submissiveness 
of the Oriental; the zstheticism, the in- 
dependence, love of innovations and in- 
quisitiveness of the ancient Greek; the 
ruggedness, sturdiness, harshness and 
conservatism of the ancient Roman; the 
emotionalism, the religious fervor of the 
ancient Hebrew; the commercialism, rest- 
lessness, speculation and scientific spirit 
of modern times, are all the results of the 
nature of the early education the individ- 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  » PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 5 
ual gets in his respective social environ- 
ment. We may say that the education 
of early life forms the very foundation 
of the social structure. 
Like clay in the hands of the potter, 
so is man in the hands of his community. 
Society fashions the beliefs, the desires, 
the aims, the strivings, the knowledge, 
the ideals, the character, the minds, the 
very selves of its constituent units. Who 
has the control of this vital function of 
moulding minds? Fathers and mothers, 
the child is under your control. To your 
hands, to your care is entrusted the fate 
of young generations, the fate of the fu- 
ture community, which, consciously or 
unconsciously, you fashion according to 
the accepted standards and traditions with 
which you have been imbued in your own 
education. 
It is related, I think, in Plutarch’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
      6 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
Lives, of Themistocles telling with the 
ironical frankness characteristic of the 
Greek temperament that his son possessed 
the greatest power in Greece: “For the 
Athenians command the rest of Greece, I 
command the Athenians, his mother com- 
mands me, and he commands his mother.” 
This bit of Greek irony is not without its 
significance. The mind of the growing 
generation controls the future of nations. 
The boy is father to the man, as the 
proverb has it; he controls the future. 
But who controls the boy? The home, 
the mother and father, the guides of the 
child’s early life. For it is in early life 
that the foundation of our mental edifice 
is laid. All that is good, valid and solid 
in man’s mental structure depends on the 
breadth, width, depth, and solidity of that 
foundation. 
   
-P-A-G-E-39
II 
Tuart the groundwork of man’s character 
is laid in his childhood appears as a triv- 
ial platitude. I am almost ashamed to 
bring it before you. And yet, as I look 
round me and find how apt we are to for- 
get this simple precept which is so funda- 
mental in our life, I cannot help calling 
your attention to it. If we consider the 
matter, we can well understand the reason 
why its full significance is not realized. 
We must remember that all science begins 
with axioms which are apparently truisms. 
What is more of a truism than the axioms 
of Geometry and Mechanics—that the 
whole is greater than the part, that things 
which are equal to the same thing are 
mi 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
     8 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
equal to one another, or that a body re- 
mains in the same state unless an exter- 
nal force changes it? And yet the whole 
of Mathematics and Mechanics is built on 
those simple axioms. 
The elements of science are just such 
obvious platitudes. What is needed is to 
use them as efficient tools and by their 
means draw the consequent effects. The 
same holds true in the science of educa- 
tion. The axiom or the law of early 
training is not new, it is well known, but 
it is unfortunately too often neglected 
and forgotten, and its significance is al- 
most completely lost. 
It is certainly surprising how this law 
of early training is so disregarded, so to- 
tally ignored in the education of the child.

structure, we do not even take care to 
clear the ground. In fact, we even make 
the child’s soul a dunghill, full of vermin 
of superstitions, fears and prejudices,— 
a hideous heap saturated with the spirit of 
credulity. 
We regard the child’s mind as a tabula 
rasa, a vacant lot, and empty on it all our 
rubbish and refuse. We labor under the 
delusion that stories and fairy tales, myths 
and deceptions about life and man are 
good for the child’s mind. Is it a won- 
der that on such a foundation men can 
only put up shacks and shanties? We 
forget the simple fact that what is harm- 
ful for the adult is still more harmful to 
the child. Surely what is poisonous to 
the grown-up mind cannot be useful food 
to the young. If credulity in old wives’ 
tales, lack of individuality, sheepish sub- 
missiveness, barrack-discipline, unques-

aping of good manners, silly games, preju- 
dices and superstitions and fears of the 
supernormal and supernatural, are cen- 
sured in adults, why should we approve 
their cultivation in the young? 
At home and at school we drill into the 
child’s mind uncritical beliefs in stories and 
tales, fictions and figments, fables and 
myths, creeds and dogmas which poison 
the very sources of the child’s mind. At 
home and at school we give the child over 
as a prey to all sorts of fatal germs of men- 
tal diseases and moral depravity. We 
leave the child’s mind an open field to 
be sown with dragon’s teeth which bring 
forth a whole crop of pernicious tenden-

cies,—love and admiration of successful 
evil, and. adoration of the rule of brute 
force. From the dragon’s teeth sown in 
early childhood there rises in later life a 
whole brood of flint-hearted men who 
blindly jostle and fight and mercilessly 
tear one another, to obtain for some greedy 
Jason, some witch of a Medea their cov-

WE regard with disapproval the bloody 
combats of some savage tribe; we regard 
with horror the sacrifice of children and 
prisoners to some idol of a Phenician Mo- 
loch or Mexican Huitzlio-Potchli; we are 
shocked at the criminal proceedings of the 
infamous Torquemada with his inquisi- 
tion glorying in its terrors and tortures 
in the name of Christ; we are sickened as 
we read of the religious wars in Europe; 
we shudder at the horrors of the night

All such atrocities, we say, belong to

barbaric ages and are only committed in 
semi-civilized countries. We flatter our- 
selves that we are different in this age of 
enlightenment and civilization. Are we 
different? Have we changed? Have 
we a right to fling stones at our older 
brothers, the savage and the barbarian? 
We are so used to our life that we do not 
notice its evils and misery. We can easily 
see the mote in the eye of our neighbor, 
but do not notice the beam in our own. 
We are still savage at heart. Our civi- 
lization is mere gloss, a thin coating 
of paint and varnish. Our methods of 
inflicting pain are more refined than those 
of the Indian, but no less cruel, while the 
number of the victims sacrificed to our 
greed and rapacity may even exceed the 
numbers fallen by the sword of the barbar- 
ian or by the torch of the fanatic. The 
slums in our cities are foul and filthy,  
-P-A-G-E-46
  14 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
teeming with deadly germs of disease 
where the mortality of our infants and 
children in some cases rises to the frightful 
figure of 204 per thousand! 
The sanitary conditions of our cities 
are filthy and deadly. They carry in 
their wake all forms of plagues, pests 
and diseases, among which tuberculosis is 
so well known to the laity. “Tubercu- 
losis,’ reads a report of a Tenement 
‘House Commission, “‘is one of the results 
of our inhumane tenements; it follows in 
the train of our inhumane sweatshops. 
It comes where the hours of labor are 
long and the wages are small; it afflicts 
the children who are sent to labor when 
they should yet be in school.” 
“The Consumers’ League,” says Mr. 
John Graham Brooks, “long hesitated to 
lay stress upon these aspects of filth and 
disease, because of their alarmist and sen-
-P-A-G-E-47
  PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 15 
sational nature, and of the immediate and 
grave risk to the consumer of the goods 
manufactured in the sweatshop and the 
tenement house. If the sweatshop spread 
diphtheria and scarlet fever, there is the 
hue and ery before personal danger. But 
these diseases are the very slightest ele- 
ments of the real risk to the general good. 
It is the spoiled human life, with its 
deadly legacy of enfeebled mind and 
body, that reacts directly and indirectly 
on the social whole.” We do not realize 
that we drift into national degeneracy. 
We fail to realize that we raise a genera- 
tion of stunted lives, of physical and 
nervous wrecks, of mental invalids and 
moral cripples. 
We boast of our wealth unrivalled by 
other countries and by former ages. We 
should remember the great poverty of our 
masses, the filthy conditions of our wealthy

cities, with their loathsome city-slums, in 
which human beings live, breed and teem 
like so many worms. 
We spend on barracks and prisons 
more than we do on schools and colleges. 
What is the level of a civilization in 
which the cost of crime and war far ex- 
ceeds. that of the education of its future 
citizens? We spend on our army and 
navy a quarter of a billion dollars, which 
is found to be insufficient, while the “total 
money burden of crime amounts in this 
country to the enormous sum of 600 mil- 
lion dollars a year!” 
The cost of crime alone is so enormous 
that a representative of the Board of 
Charities of one of our Eastern states 
considers “the entire abolition of all the 
penal codes and the complete liberty of 
the criminal class.” Our civilization can 
boast of the city-slum, the abode of mis-

ery and crime, the gift of our modern in- 
dustrial progress, wealth and prosperity. 
Professor James and myself were over 
once on a visit to a charitable institution 
for mentally defective. With his clear 
eye for the incongruities and absurdities 
of life, Professor James remarked to me 
that idiots and imbeciles were given the 
comforts, in fact, the luxuries of life, while 
healthy children, able boys and girls, had 
to struggle for a livelihood. Children 
under fourteen work in factories, work at 
a wage of about twenty-five cents a day, 
and, according to the labor bureau, the 
daily wage of the factory children of the 
South is often as low as fifteen cents and 
sometimes falls to nine cents. In many 
of our colleges many a student has to live 
on the verge of starvation, freeze in a 
summer overcoat the whole winter and 
warm his room by burning newspapers in 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  18 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
the grate. We are charitable and help 
our mediocrities, imbeciles and_ idiots, 
while we neglect our talent and genius. 
We have a blind faith that genius, like 
murder, will out. We know of success- 
ful talent, but we do not know of the 
great amount of unsuccessful talent and 
genius that has gone to waste. We favor 
imbecility and slight genius. 
One of the physicians of the institution 
overheard our conversation and attempted 
to justify his work by an argument com- 
monly advanced and uncritically ac- 
cepted—“Our civilization, our Christian 
civilization values human life.’ Does 
our civilization really value human life? 
The infant mortality of the slums of our 
large cities and the factory work of our 
young children do not seem to justify 
such a claim. 
The loss of life on our railways is as
-P-A-G-E-51
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 19 
large as one caused by a national war. 
Thus the number of persons killed on 
American railways during a period of 
three years ending June 30, 1900, was 
about 22,000, while the mortality of 
British forces, including death from dis- 
ease, during three years of the South Af- 
rican war amounted to 22,000. In 1901, 
one out of every 400 railway employees 
was killed and one out of every 26 was 
injured. In 1902, 2,969 employees were 
killed and 50,524 were injured. 
Commenting on the statistics of rail- 
way accidents, Mr. John Graham Brooks 
says: “One has to read and re-read 
these figures before their grewsome sig- 
nificance is in the least clear. If we 
add the mining, iron and lumbering in- 
dustries,—portions of which are more dan- 
gerous than the railroad,—some concep- 
tion is possible of the mutilated life due 
to machinery as it is now run.” It may
-P-A-G-E-52

also be of interest to learn that, according 
to the calculation made by a representa- 
tive of one of the insurance companies, 
more than a million and a half are annu- 
ally killed and injured in the United 
States alone. 
The waste of human life is in fact 
greater than in any previous age. “Saul 
hath slain his thousands, but David his 
ten thousands.” Think of our modern 
warfare, with its infernal machines of 
carnage, mowing down more men in a day 
than the warlike Assyrians and Romans, 
with their crude bows, arrows and cata- 
pults, could destroy in a century. And 
is not our country, our civilized Christian 
society, with its high valuation of human 
life, keeping on increasing its army and 
navy, and perfecting deadly weapons of 
slaughter and carnage? What about the 
justice dealt out by Judge Lynch? From
-P-A-G-E-53
  PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 21 
1882 to 1900 there were about three thou- 
sand lynchings! What about our grand 
imperial policy? What about our dom- 
inance over weak and ignorant tribes, 
treated in no gentle way by the armed 
fist of their civilized masters, who send 
to the benighted heathens their mission- 
aries to preach religion and their soldiers 
to enforce the sale of narcotics and other 
civilizing goods?

We are stock-blind to our own barbar- 
ities; we do not realize the enormities of 
our life and consider our age and country 
as civilized and enlightened. We censure 
the faults of other societies, but do not 
notice our own. Thus Lecky, in describ- 
ing Roman society, says: “The gladia- 
torial games form indeed the one feature 
which to a modern mind is almost in- 
conceivable in its atrocity. That not only 
men, but women, in an advanced period of 
civilization,—men and women who not 
only professed, but very frequently acted 
upon a high code of morals—should have 
made the carnage of men their habitual 
amusement, that all this should have con- 
22
-P-A-G-E-55
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 23 
tinued for centuries with scarcely a pro- 
test, is one of the most startling facts in 
moral history. It is, however, perfectly 
normal, while it opens out fields of eth- 
ical inquiry of a very deep, though pain- 
ful, character.” 
As in modern times, our college author- 
ities justify the brutalities of football 
and prize-fights, so in ancient times the 
great moralists of those ages justified 
their gladiatorial games. Thus the great 
orator, the moralizing philosopher, Cicero, 
in speaking of the gladiatorial games, 
tells us: “When guilty men are com- 
pelled to fight, no better discipline against 
suffering and death can be presented to 
the eye.” And it is certainly instructive 
for us to learn that “the very men who 
looked down with delight, when the sand 
of the arena redderied with human blood, 
made the theater ring with applause when 
   
-P-A-G-E-56
  24 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
Terence in his famous line proclaimed the 
brotherhood of men.” 
One feeble protest is on record, a protest 
coming from the mother of civilization, 
from ancient Athens. “When an attempt 
was made to introduce the games into 
Athens, the philosopher Demonax ap- 
pealed successfully to the better feelings 
of the people by exclaiming: “You must 
first overthrow the altar of pity!” 
The philosopher Demonax had not the 
compromising spirit of the modern pro- 
fessor. Although the brutal games of 
our youth and populace need a Demonax, 
we certainly should not look for one in our 
colleges and universities. Our college au- 
thorities assure us that athletic prestige is 
indispensable to a good university. In 
fact, according to some official statements, 
football teams are supposed to express the 
superior intellectual activities of our fore-
-P-A-G-E-57
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 25 
most colleges. Like Cicero of old, we 
claim that “our games are good,—they 
train men, and no better discipline can be 
presented to the eye.” 
The fact is, man is bat-blind to the evils 
of the environment in which he is bred. 
He takes those evils as a matter of course, 
and even finds good reasons to justify 
them as edifying and elevating. In re- 
lation to his own surroundings, man is in 
the primitive condition of the Biblical 
Adam,—he is not conscious of his own 
moral nakedness. Six days in the week 
we witness and uphold the wholesale car- 
nage, national and international, political, 
economical, in shops, factories, mines, 
railroads and on the battlefields, while on 
the seventh we sing hymns to the God of 
mercy, love and peace. 
We pick up the first newspapers or 
popular magazines that come to our hand, 
   
-P-A-G-E-58
  26 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
and we read of wars, slaughters, murders, 
lynchings, crimes and outrages on life and 
liberty; we read of strikes, lockouts, of 
tales of starvation and of frightful infant 
mortality; we read of diseases and epi- 
demics ravaging the homes of our working 
population; we read of corporation in- 
iquities, of frauds and corruption of our 
legislative bodies, of the control of politics 
by the criminal classes of the great me- 
tropolis of our land. We read of all that 
evil and corruption, but forget them next 
moment. 
Our social life is corrupt, our body pol- 
itic is eaten through with cankers and 
sores, “the whole head is sick and the 
whole heart is faint. From the sole of 
the foot even unto the head, there is no 
soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises 
and putrefying sores,” and yet we think 
we are a civilized people, superior to all
-P-A-G-E-59
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS av 
countries and to all ages. “The voice of 
our brother’s blood crieth unto us from 
the ground.” How can we be so callous? 
How can we be so mole-blind and so stone- 
deaf? 
The truth is, we have but a thin varnish 
of humaneness, glossing over a rude bar- 
barism. With our lips we praise the God 
of love, but in our hearts we adore the 
God of force. How much physical force 
is worshipped we can realize from the 
crowds that throng the games of base- 
ball, football, prize-fights and boxing ex- 
hibitions. They go into tens of thou- 
sands. How many would be drawn by a 
St. Paul, an Epictetus, or a Socrates? 
The newspaper, the mirror of our social 
life, is filled with the names and exploits 
of our magnates of high finance, our 
money-mongers and usurers. Our jour- 
nals teem with deeds and scandals of our 
refined “smart set” set up as patterns, as       
     
    
   
          
-P-A-G-E-60
28 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
ideals, after which our middle class so 
longingly craves. Like the Israelites of 
old we worship golden calves and sa- 
cred bulls. Our daughters yearn after 
the barbaric shimmer and glitter of the 
bejewelled, bespangled, empty-minded, 
parasitic females of “the smart set.” Our 
college boys admire the feats of the 
trained athlete and scorn the work of the 
“grind.” Our very schoolboys crave for 
the fame of a Jeffries and a Johnson. If 
in the depths of space there is some solar 
system inhabited by really rational beings, 
and if one of such beings should by some 
miracle happen to visit our planet, he 
would no doubt turn away in horror.

WE press our children into the trium- 
phant march of our industrial Jugger- 
naut. Over 1,700,000 children under 15 
years of age toil in fields, factories, mines 
and workshops. ‘The slums and the fac- 
tory cripple the energies of our young 
generation. The slaughter of the inno- 
cents and the sacrifice of our children to 
the insatiable Moloch of industry exclude 
us from the rank of civilized society and 
place us on the level of barbaric nations. 
Our educators are narrow-minded ped- 
ants. They are occupied with the dry 
bones of text-books, the sawdust of peda- 
gogics and the would-be scientific ex- 
periments of educational psychology; they.

  30 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
are ignorant of the real vital problems of 
human interests, a knowledge of which 
goes to make the truly educated man. 
About the middle of the nineteenth 
century, Buckle made the prediction that 
no war was any more to occur among civi- 
lized nations. Henceforth peace was to 
reign supreme. “The wolf shall dwell 
with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie 
down with the kid; their young ones shall 
lie down together, and the lion shall eat 
straw likethe ox. . . . Nations shall 
beat their swords into ploughshares 
and their spears into pruning hooks. Na- 
tion shall not lift up sword against nation, 
nor shall they learn war any more.” This 
prophecy was rather hasty. We have had 
since the Civil war, the Franco-Prussian 
war, the Spanish-American war, the Boer 
war, the Russo-Japanese war, not count- 
ing the ceaseless wars of extermination 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 31 
carried on by civilized nations among 
the various semi-civilized nations and 
primitive tribes. Civilized nations do not 
as yet beat their swords into ploughshares, 
but keep on increasing the strength of 
their “armed peace,” and are ready to fight 
bloody battles in the quest of new lands and 
the conquest of new markets. 
In spite of The Hague conference of 
peace convoked by the peace-loving Czar, 
no other age has had such large standing 
armies provided with such costly and ef- 
ficient weapons of execution ready for in- 
stant use. The red spectre still stalks 
abroad claiming its victims. We still be- 
lieve in the baptism of fire and redemp- 
tion by blood. The dogma of blood-re- 
demption is still at the basis of our faith 
and, consciously or unconsciously, we 
brand that sacred creed on the minds of 
the young generation.
-P-A-G-E-64
32 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
We are not educated to see and under- 
stand the wretchedness, the misery of our 
life,—the evil of the world falls on the 
blind spot of our eye. In the name of 
evolution and the survival of the fittest, 
we justify the grasping arm of the strong, 
and even glory in the extermination of 
the weak. ‘The weak, we say, must be 
weeded out by the processes of natural 
selection. The strong are the best; it is 
right that they should survive and flourish 
like a green bay tree. The fact is that we 
are still dominated by the law of the 
jungle, the den and the cave. We are 
still wild at heart. We still harken to the 
call of the wild; we are ruled by the fist, 
the claw and the tooth. 
Love, justice, gentleness, peace, reason, 
sympathy and pity, all humane feelings 
and promptings are with us sentiments of 
“unnatural” or supernatural religion
-P-A-G-E-65
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 33 
which we profess in our churches, but in 
which we really have no faith as good for 
actual life. We mistake brutishness for 
courage, and by fight and by war we train 
the beast in man. 
All humane feelings are regarded as so 
many hindrances to progress; they favor, 
we claim, the survival of the weak. We 
are, of course, evolutionists, and believe 
most firmly in progress. We believe that 
the luxuries and vices of the strong are 
conducive to prosperity, and that the evils 
of life by the automatic grinding of that 
grind-organ known as the process of evo- a 
lution somehow lead to a higher civiliza- 
tion. 
When in the beginning of the eighteenth 
century Bernard de Mandeville pro- 
claimed the apparently paradoxical prin- 
ciple that Private Vices are Public Bene- 
fits, the academic moralists were shocked 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  34 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
at such profane brutality. Mandeville 
only proclaimed the leading, the guiding 
principle of the coming age of industrial 
prosperity. We now know better. Are 
we not evolutionists? Have we not 
learned that progress and evolution and 
the improvement of the race are brought 
about by the fierce struggle for existence, 
by the process of natural selection, by the 
merciless elimination of the weak and by 
the triumph of the strong and the fit? 
What is the use of being sentimental? 
Like Brennus, the Gaul, we throw our 
sword on the scales of blinded justice and 
shout triumphantly “Ve victis?’

WE are confirmed optimists and sow op- 
timism broadcast. We have optimistic 
clubs and mental scientists and Christian 
scientists,—all afflicted with incurable 
ophthalmia to surrounding evil and mis- 
ery. We are scientific, we are evolution- 
ists, we have faith in the sort of optimism 
taught by Leibnitz in his famous Theo- 
dicea. We are the Candides of our or- 
acles, the Panglosses. You may possibly 
remember what Voltaire writes of Pro- 
fessor Pangloss. “Pangloss used to 
teach the science of metaphysico-theolo- 
go-cosmologo-noodleology. He demon- 
strated to admiration that there is no effect 
without a cause and that this is the best of 
35
-P-A-G-E-68
  36 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
all possible worlds. It has been proved, 
said Pangloss, that things cannot be other- 
wise than they are; for everything, the 
end for which everything is made, is nec- 
essarily the best end. Observe how noses 
are made to carry spectacles, and specta- 
cles we have accordingly. Everything 
that is, is the best that could possibly be.” 
It is such shallow optimism that now gains 
currency. 
Verily, we are afflicted with mental 
cataract. “If we should bring clearly 
to a man’s sight,’ says Schopenhauer, 
“the terrible sufferings and miseries to 
which his life is constantly exposed, he 
would be seized with horror, and if we 
were to conduct the confirmed optimist 
through the hospitals, infirmaries, and 
surgical operating-rooms, through pris- 
ons, asylums, torture-chambers and slave- 
kennels, over battlefields and places of 
execution; if we were to open to him all
-P-A-G-E-69
  
  PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 37 
the dark abodes of misery, where it hides 
itself from the glance of cold curiosity, he 
would understand at last the nature of 
this best of possible worlds.” 
Schopenhauer is metaphysical, pessi- 
mistic, but he is certainly not blinded by 
a shallow optimism to the realities of life. 
Drunk with the spirit of optimism, we 
do not realize the degradation, the misery 
and poverty of our life. Meanwhile the 
human genius, the genius which all of us 
possess, languishes, famishes, and perishes, 
while the brute alone emerges in triumph. 
We are so overcome by the faith in the 
transcendent, optimistic evolution of the 
good, that through the misty, heavenly, 
angelic visions, we do not discern the 
cloven hoof of the devil. 
Professor James in a recent address 
told the Radcliffe graduates that the aim 
of a college-education is “to recognize the 
good man,” when you see him. This ad- 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  38 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
vice may be good for Radcliffe young 
ladies; but, fathers and mothers, the true 
education of life is the recognition of evil 
wherever it is met. 
The Bible begins the story of man in a 
paradise of ignorance and finishes it with 
his tasting of the fruits of the forbidden 
tree of knowledge of good and evil. 
“And the eyes of them both were opened 
and they knew that they were naked. 
And the Lord God said,—Behold, the 
man is become as one of us to know good 
and evil, and now, lest he put forth his 
hand and take also of the tree of life and 
eat and live for ever. Therefore, the 
Lord God sent him forth from the garden 
of Eden. So he drove out the man.” 
We prefer the sinful, mortal, but godlike 
man with his knowledge of evil to the 
brutish philistine in the bliss of Elysium.

In ‘the education of the young genera- 
tion the purpose of the nation is to bring 
up the child as a good man, as a liberal- 
minded citizen, devoted soul and body to 
the interests of social welfare. This pur- 
pose in the education of the young citizen 
is of the utmost importance in every so- 
ciety, but it is a vital need in a democratic 
society. We do not want narrow-minded 
patriots devoted to party-factions, nor big- 
oted sectarians, nor greedy entrepreneurs 
fastening in trusts, like so many barnacles, 
on the body-politic. We do not want

fellow-men.

The purpose of the education provided 
by the nation for its young generation is 
the rearing of healthy, talented, broad- 
minded citizens. We need, above all, 
good citizens, active and intelligent, with 
a knowledge of life and with a delicate 
sense of discrimination and detection of 
evil in all its protean forms; we need 
strong-minded citizens with grit and 
courage to resist oppression and root out 
evil wherever it is found. A strong sense 
of recognition of evil should be the social 
sense of every well-educated citizen as a 
safeguard of social and national life. 
The principle of recognition of evil wnder 
all its guises is at the basis of the true edu- 
cation of man. 
Is it not strange that this vital prin- 
ciple of education, the recognition of evil, 
—a fundamental principle with the great 
thinkers of humanity,—should remain so
-P-A-G-E-73

sadly neglected by our educators and pub- 
lic instructors? Our educators are owl- 
wise, our teachers are pedants and all their 
ambition is the turning out of smooth, 
well-polished philistines. It is a sad case 
of the blind leading the blind. 
It is certainly unfortunate that the fa- 
vored type of superintendent of our pub- 
lic education should be such a hopeless 
philistine, possessed of all the conceit of 
the mediocre business man. Routine is 
his ideal. Originality and genius are 
spurned and suppressed. Our _ school- 
superintendent with his well-organized 
training-shop is proud of the fact that 
there is no place for genius in our schools. 
Unfortunate and degraded is the nation 
that has handed over its childhood and 
youth to guidance and control by hide- 
bound mediocrity. Our school-managers 
are respected by the laity as great educa-
-P-A-G-E-74
  42 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
tors and are looked up to by the teachers 
as able business men. Their merit is 
routine, discipline and the hiring of cheap 
teaching-employees. 
It is certainly a great misfortune to the 
nation that a good number of our would- 
be scientific pedagogues are such medioc- 
rities, with so absurd an exaggeration of 
their importance that they are well satis- 
fied if the mass of their pupils turn out 
exact reproductions of the silly peda- 
gogue. What can be expected of a na- 
tion that entrusts the fate of its young 
generation to the care or carelessness of 
young girls, to the ire of old maids, and 
to pettifogging officials with their educa- 
tional red tape, discipline and routine,— 
petty bureaucrats animated with a hatred 
towards talent and genius? 
The goody-goody schoolma’am, the 
mandarin-schoolmaster, the _ philistine-
-P-A-G-E-75
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS AS 
pedagogue, the pedant-administrator with 
his business capacities, have proved them- 
selves incompetent to deal with the edu- 
cation of the young. ‘They stifle talent, 
they stupefy the intellect, they paralyze 
the will, they suppress genius, they be- 
numb the faculties of our children. The 
educator, with his pseudo-scientific, 
pseudo-psychological pseudogogics, can 
only bring up a set of philistines with 
firm, set habits,—marionettes,—dolls. 
Business is put above learning, admin- 
istration above education, discipline and 
order above cultivation of genius and tal- 
ent. Our schools and colleges are con- 
trolled by business men. The school- 
boards, the boards of trustees of almost 
every school and college in the country 
consist mainly of manufacturers, store- 
keepers, tradesmen, bulls and bears of 
Wall street and the market-place. What
-P-A-G-E-76
  44 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
wonder that they bring with them the 
ideals and methods of the factory, the 
store, the bank and the saloon. If the 
saloon controls politics, the shop controls 
education. 
Business men are no more competent to 
run schools and colleges than astronomers 
are fit to run hotels and theaters. Our 
whole educational system is vicious. A 
popular scientific journal entered a pro- 
test against the vulgarization of our col- 
leges, the department-store trade methods 
of our universities, but to no avail. The 
popular hero, the administrative business 
superintendent still holds sway, and poi- 
sons the sources of our social life by de- 
basing the very foundation of our na- 
tional education.
-P-A-G-E-77

From time to time the “educational” 
methods of our philistine teachers are 
brought to light. A girl is forced by a 
schoolma’am of one of our large cities to 
stay in a corner for hours, because she 
unintentionally transgressed against the 
barrack-discipline of the school-regula- 
tions. When the parents became afraid 
of the girl’s health and naturally took 
her out of school, the little girl was 
dragged before the court by the truant 
officer. Fortunately “the judge turned to 
the truant officer and asked him how the 
girl could be a truant, if she had been sus- 
pended. He didn’t believe in breaking 
children’s wills.”

In another city a pupil of genius was 
excluded from school because “he did not 
fall in with the system” laid out by the 
“very able business-superintendent.” A 
schoolmistress conceives the happy idea of 
converting two of her refractory pupils 
into pin-cushions for the edification of 
her class. An “educational” administra- 
tive superintendent of a large, prosperous 
community told a lady who brought to 
him her son, an extraordinarily able boy, 
“T shall not take your boy into my high- 
school, in spite of his knowledge.” When 
the mother asked him to listen to her, he 
lost patience and told her with all the 
force of his school-authority, “Madam, 
put a rope around his neck, weigh him 
well down with bricks!” 
A principal of a high school in one of 
the prominent New England towns dis- 
misses a highly talented pupil because, to 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
  PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 47 
quote verbatim from the original school 
document, “He is not amenable to the dis- 
cipline of the school, as his school life has 
been too short to establish him in the habit 
of obedience.” “His intellect,” the prin- 
cipal’s official letter goes on to say, “re- 
mains a marvel to us, but we do not feel, 
and in this I think I speak for all, 
that he is in the right place.” In other 
words, in the opinion of those remarkable 
pedagogues, educators and teachers, the 
school is not the right place for talent and 
genius! 
A superintendent of schools in lectur- 
ing before an audience of “subordinate 
teachers” told them emphatically that 
there was no place for genius in our 
schools. Dear old fogies, one can well 
understand your indignation! Here we 
have worked out some fine methods, clever 
rules, beautiful systems and then comes 
 
-P-A-G-E-80

genius and upsets the whole structure! 
It isa shame! Genius cannot fit into the 
pigeon-holes of the office desk. Choke 
genius, and things will move smoothly in 
the school and the office. 
Not long ago we were informed by one 
of those successful college-mandarins, 
lionized by office-clerks, superintendents 
and tradesmen, that he could measure ed- 
ucation by the foot-rule! Our Regents 
are supposed to raise the level of educa- 
tion by a vicious system of examination 
and coaching, a system which Professor 
James, in a private conversation with 
me, has aptly characterized as “idiotic.” 
Our schools brand their pupils by a sys- 
tem of marks, while our foremost colleges 
measure the knowledge and education of 
their students by the number of “points” 
passed. The student may pass either in 
Logic or Blacksmithing. It does not
-P-A-G-E-81
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 49 
matter which, provided he makes up a cer- 
tain number of “points”! 
College-committees refuse admission 
to young students of genius, because “it 
is against the policy and the principles of 
the university.” College-professors ex- 
pel promising students from the lecture- 
room for “the good of the class as a 
whole,” because the students “happen to 
handle their hats in the middle of a lec- 
ture.” This, you see, interferes with 
class discipline. Fiat justitia, spereat 
mundus. Let genius perish, provided the 
system lives. Why not suppress all ge- 
nius, as a disturbing element, for “the 
good of the classes,” for the weal of the 
commonwealth? Education of man and 
cultivation of genius, indeed! This is not 
school policy. 
We school and drill our children and 
youth in schoolma’am mannerism, school-
-P-A-G-E-82
  50 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
master mind-ankylosis, school-superin- 
tendent stiff-joint ceremonialism, factory 
regulations and office-discipline. We give 
our pupils and students artisan-inspira- 
tion and business-spirituality. Original- 
ity issuppressed. Individuality is crushed. 
Mediocrity is at a premium. That is why 
our country has such clever business men, 
such cunning artisans, such resourceful 
politicians, such adroit leaders of new 
cults, but no scientists, no artists, no 
philosophers, no statesmen, no genuine 
talent and no true genius. 
School-teachers have in all ages been 
mediocre in intellect and incompetent. 
Leibnitz is regarded as a dullard and 
Newton is. considered as a_ blockhead. 
Never, however, in the history of mankind 
have school teachers fallen to such a low 
level of mediocrity as in our times and in 
our country. For it is not the amount of
-P-A-G-E-83
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS oy 
knowledge that counts in true education, 
but originality and independence of 
thought that are of importance in educa- 
tion. But independence and originality 
of thought are just the very elements that 
are suppressed by our modern barrack- 
system of education. No wonder that 
military men claim that the best “educa- 
tion” is given in military schools. 
We are not aware that the incubus of 
officialdom, and the succubus of bureau- 
cracy have taken possession of our schools. 
The red tape of officialdom, like a poison- 
ous weed, grows luxuriantly in our schools 
and chokes the life of our young genera- 
tion. . Instead of growing into a people 
of great independent thinkers, the nation 
is in danger of fast becoming a crowd of 
well-drilled, well-disciplined, commonplace 
individuals, with strong philistine habits 
and notions of hopeless mediocrity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  52 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
In levelling education to mediocrity. we 
imagine that we uphold the democratic 
spirit of our institutions. Our American 
sensibilities are shocked when the presi- 
dent of one of our leading colleges dares 
to recommend to his college that it should 
cease catering to the average student. 
We think it un-American, rank treason 
to our democratic spirit when a college 
president has the courage to proclaim the 
principle that “To form the mind and 
character of one man of marked talent, 
not to say genius, would be worth more to 
the community which he would serve than 
the routine training of hundreds of un- 
dergraduates.” 
We are optimistic, we believe in the 
pernicious superstition that genius needs 
no help, that talent will take care of it- 
self. Our kitchen clocks and dollar time- 
pieces need careful handling, but our
-P-A-G-E-85
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 53 
chronometers and astronomical clocks can 
run by themselves. 
The truth is, however, that the purpose 
of the school and the college is not to cre- 
ate an intellectual aristocracy, but to edu- 
cate, to bring out the individuality, the 
originality, the latent powers of talent 
and genius present in what we unfortu- 
nately regard as “the average student.” 
Follow Mill’s advice. Instead of aiming 
at athletics, social connections, vocations 
and generally at the professional art of 
money-making, “Aim at something noble. 
Make your system such that a great man 
may be formed by it, and there will be a 
manhood in your little men, of which you 
do not dream.” 
Awaken in early childhood the crit- 
ical spirit of man; awaken, early in 
the child’s life, love of knowledge, love 
of truth, of art and literature for their
-P-A-G-E-86
  54 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
own sake, and you arouse man’s genius. 
We have average mediocre students, be- 
cause we have mediocre teachers, depart- 
ment-store superintendents, clerkly prin- 
cipals and deans with bookkeepers’ souls, 
because our schools and colleges deliber- 
ately aim at mediocrity. 
Ribot in describing the degenerated 
Byzantine Greeks tells us that their lead- 
ers were mediocrities and their great 
men commonplace personalities. Is the 
American nation drifting in the same di- 
rection? It was the system of cultiva- 
tion of independent thought that awak- 
ened the Greek mind to its highest achieve- 
ments in arts, science and philosophy; it 
was the deadly Byzantine bureaucratic 
red tape with its cut-and-dried theological 
discipline that dried up the sources of 
Greek genius. We are in danger of 
building up a Byzantine empire with large
-P-A-G-E-87
  
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 55 
institutions and big corporations, but 
with small minds and dwarfed individuali- 
ties. Like the Byzantines we begin to 
value administration above individuality 
and official, red-tape ceremonialism above 
originality. 
We wish even to turn our schools into 
practical school-shops. We shall in time 
become a nation of well-trained clerks and 
clever artisans. The time is at hand when 
we shall be justified in writing over the 
gates of our school-shops “mediocrity 
made here!”

I assume that as liberal men and women 
you have no use for the process of cram- 
ming and stuffing of college-geese and 
mentally indolent, morally obtuse and 
religiously “cultured” prigs and _philis- 
tines, but that you realize that your true 
vocation is to get access to the latent ener- 
gies of your children, to stimulate their re- 
serve energies and educate, bring to light, 
man’s genius. The science of psychopath- 
ology now sets forth a fundamental prin- 
ciple which is not only of the utmost im- 
portance in psychotherapeutics, but also 
in the domain of education; it is the prin- 
ciple of stored up, dormant, reserve- 
energy,—the principle of potential, sub- 
conscious, reserve energy. 
56
-P-A-G-E-89
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 57 
It is claimed on good evidence, biolog- 
ical, physiological and psychopathological, 
that man possesses large stores of unused 
energy which the ordinary stimuli of life 
are not only unable to reach, but even 
tend to inhibit. Unusual combinations of 
circumstances, however, radical changes 
of the environment, often unloose the in- 
hibitions brought about by the habitual 
narrow range of man’s interests and sur- 
roundings. Such unloosening of inhibi- 
tions helps to release fresh supplies of re- 
serve energy. It is not the place here to 
discuss this fundamental principle; I can 
only state it in the most general way, and 
give its general trend in the domain of 
education. 
You have heard the psychologizing ed- 
ucator advise the formation of good, fixed, 
stable habits in early life. Now I want 
to warn you against the dangers of such 
   
-P-A-G-E-90
  
  58 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
unrestricted advice. Fixed adaptations, 
stable habits, tend to raise the thresholds 
of mental life, tend to inhibit the libera- 
tion, the output of reserve-energy. 
Avoid routine. Do not let your pupils 
fall into the ruts of habits and customs. 
Do not let even the best of habits harden 
beyond the point of further possible modi- 
fication. 
Where there is a tendency towards 
formation of over-abundant mental car- 
tilage, set your pupils to work under 
widely different circumstances. Con- 
front them with a changed set of condi- 
tions. Keep them on the move. Sur- 
prise them by some apparently paradoxi- 
cal relations and strange phenomena. 
Do not let them settle down to one definite 
set of actions or reactions. Remember 
that rigidity, like sclerosis, induration of 
tissue, means decay of originality, destruc-
-P-A-G-E-91
  PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 59 
tion of man’s genius. With solidified and 
unvariable habits not only does the re- 
serve energy become entirely inaccessible, 
but the very individuality is extinguished. 
Do not make of our children a nation of 
philistines. Why say, you make man in 
your own image? Do not make your 
schools machine-shops, turning out on one 
uniform pattern so much mediocrity per 
year. Cultivate variability. The tend- 
ency towards variability is the most pre- 
cious part of a good education. Beware 
of the philistine with his set, stable habits. 
The important principle in education is 
not so much formation of habits as the 
power of their re-formation. The power 
of breaking up habits is by far the more 
essential factor of a good education. It 
is in this power of breaking down habits 
that we can find the key for the unlock- 
ing of the otherwise inaccessible stores of
-P-A-G-E-92
  60 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
subconscious reserve energy. The culti- 
vation of the power of habit-disintegra- 
tion is what constitutes the proper educa- 
tion of man’s genius.* 
*A well known editor of one of the academic Journals 
on Educational Psychology writes to me as follows: 
“Your remarks on the avoidance of routine would 
be like a red rag to a bull for a number of educa- 
tors who are emphasizing the importance of habit for- 
mation in education at present.”
-P-A-G-E-93
xX 
TuE power of breaking down or dissolv- 
ing habits depends on the amount and 
strength of the aqua fortis of the intellect. 
The logical and critical activities of the 
individual should be cultivated with spe- 
cial care. The critical self, as we may 
put it, should have control over the auto- 
matic and the subconscious. For the sub- 
conscious has been shown to form the 
fertile soil for the breeding of the most 
dangerous germs of mental disease, epi- 
demics, plagues and pestilences in their 
worst forms. We should try to develop 
the individual’s critical abilities in early 
childhood, not permitting the suggestible 
subconsciousness to predominate, and to 
61
-P-A-G-E-94
  62 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
become overrun with noxious weeds and 
pests. 
We should be very careful with the 
child’s critical self, as it is weak and has 
little resistance. We should, therefore, 
avoid all dominating authority and cate- 
goricalimperative commands. Autocratic 
authority cultivates in the child the predis- 
position to abnormal suggestibility, to 
hypnotic states, and leads towards the 
dominance of the subconscious with its 
train of pernicious tendencies and delete- 
rious results. 
There is a period in the child’s life 
"between the ages of five and ten when 
he is very inquisitive, asking all kinds 
of questions. It is the age of discus- 
sion in the child.’ This inquisitiveness 
and discussion should by all means be en- 
couraged and fostered. We should aid 
the development of the spirit of inquisi-
-P-A-G-E-95
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 63 
tiveness and curiosity in the child. For 
this is the acquisition of control over the 
stored-up, latent energies of man’s genius. 
We should not arrest the child’s ques- 
tioning spirit, as we are often apt to do, 
but should strongly encourage the appar- 
ently meddlesome and troublesome search- 
ing and prying and scrutinizing of what- 
ever interests the child. Everything 
should be open to the child’s searching in- 
terest; nothing should be suppressed and 
tabooed as too sacred for examination. 
The spirit of inquiry, the genius of man, 
is more sacred than any abstract belief, 
dogma and creed. 
A rabbi came to ask my advice about 
the education of his little boy. My ad- 
vice was: “Teach him not to be a Jew.” 
The man of God departed and never came 
again. The rabbi did not care for edu- 
cation, but for faith. He did not wish 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
64 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
his boy to become a man, but to be a Jew. 
The most central, the most crucial part 
of the education of man’s genius is the 
knowledge, the recognition of evil in all 
its protean forms and innumerable dis- 
guises, intellectual, «sthetic and moral, 
such as fallacies, sophisms, ugliness, de- 
formity, prejudice, superstition, vice and 
depravity. Do not be afraid to discuss 
these matters with the child. For the 
knowledge, the recognition of evil does 
not only possess the virtue of immuniza- 
tion of the child’s mind against all evil, 
but furnishes the main power for habit- 
disintegration with consequent release and 
control of potential reserve energy, of 
manifestations of human genius. When 
a man becomes contented and ceases to 
notice the evils of life, as is done by some 
modern religious sects, he loses his hold on 
the powers of man’s genius, he loses touch
-P-A-G-E-97
  
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 65 
with the throbbing pulse of humanity, he 
loses hold on reality and falls into sub- 
human groups. 
The purpose of education, of a liberal 
education, is not to live in a fool’s paradise, 
or to go through the world in a post-hyp- 
notice state of negative hallucinations. 
The true aim of a liberal education is, as 
the Scriptures put it, to have the eyes 
opened,—to be free from all delusions, 
illusions, from the fata morgana of life. 
We prize a liberal education, because it 
liberates us from subjection to supersti- 
tious fears, delivers us from the narrow 
bonds of prejudice, from the exalted or 
depressing delusions of moral paresis, in- 
tellectual dementia-praecox, and religious 
paranoia. A liberal education liberates 
us from the enslavement to the degrading 
influence of all idol-worship. 
In the education of man do not play on
-P-A-G-E-98
  66 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
his subconscious sense by deluding him by 
means of hypnotic and post-hypnotic sug- 
gestions of positive and negative hallu- 
cinations, with misty and mystic, beatific 
visions. Open his eyes to undisguised re- 
ality. Teach him, show him how to strip 
the real from its unessential wrappings 
and adornments and see things in their 
nakedness. Open the eyes of your chil- 
dren so that they shall see, understand 
and face courageously the evils of life. 
Then will you do your duty as parents, 
then will you give your children the 
proper education.
-P-A-G-E-99

I wave spoken of the fundamental law 
of early education. The question is “how 
early?” ‘There are, of course, children 
who are backward in their development. 
This backwardness may either be congen- 
ital or may be due to some overlooked 
pathological condition that may be easily 
remedied by proper treatment. In the 
large majority of children, however, the 
beginning of education is between the 
second and third year. It is at that time 
that the child begins to form his interests. 
It is at that critical period that we have 
to seize the opportunity to guide the 
child’s formative energies in the right 
channels. To delay is a mistake and a 
67 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  68 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
wrong to the child. We can at that early 
period awaken a love of knowledge which 
will persist through life. The child will 
as eagerly play in the game of knowledge 
as he now spends the most of his energies 
in meaningless games and objectless silly 
sports. 
We claim we are afraid to force the 
child’s mind. We claim we are afraid 
to strain his brain prematurely. 'This is 
an error. In directing the course of the 
use of the child’s energies we do not force 
the child. If you do not direct the ener- 
gies in the right course, the child will 
waste them in the wrong direction. The 
same amount of mental energy used in 
those silly games, which we think are spe- 
cially adapted for the childish mind, can 
be directed, with lasting benefit, to the de- 
velopment of his interests in intellectual
-P-A-G-E-101
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 69 
activity and love of knowledge. The 
child will learn to play at the game of 
knowledge-acquisition with the same ease, 
grace and interest as he is showing now in 
his nursery-games and physical exercises.

ARISTOTLE laid it down as a self-evident 
proposition that all Hellenes love knowl- 
edge. This was true of the national gen- 
ius of the ancient Greeks. The love of wis- 
dom is the pride of the ancient Greek in 
contradistinction to the barbarian, who 
does not prize knowledge. We still be- 
long to the barbarians. Our children, our 
pupils, our students have no love of knowl- 
edge. 
The ancient Greeks knew the value of 
a good education and understood its 
fundamental elements. They laid great 
stress on early education and they knew 
how to develop man’s mental energies, 
without fear of injury to the brain and 
70 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
  PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 71 
physical constitution. The Greeks were 
not afraid of thought, that it might in- 
jure the brain. They were strong men, 
great thinkers. 
The love of knowledge, the love of truth 
for its own sake, is entirely neglected in 
our modern schemes of education. In- 
stead of training men we train mechanics, 
artisans and shopkeepers. We turn our 
national schools, high schools and univer- 
sities into trade-schools and machine-shops. 
The school, whether lower or higher, has 
now one purpose in view, and that is the 
training of the pupil in the art of money- 
making. Is it a wonder that the result 
is a low form of mediocrity, a dwarfed and 
crippled specimen of humanity? 
Open the reports of our school superin- 
tendents and you find that the illustrations 
setting forth the prominent work per- 
formed by the school represent carpentry,  
-P-A-G-E-104
  72 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
shoemaking, blacksmithing, bookkeeping, 
typewriting, dressmaking, millinery and 
cookery. One wonders whether it is the 
report of a factory inspector, the “scien- 
tific’ advertisement of some instrument- 
maker or machine-shop, a booklet of some 
popular hotel, or an extensive circular of 
some large department-store. Is this 
what our modern education consists in? 
Is the aim of the nation to form at its ex- 
pense vast reserve armies of skilled me- 
chanics, great numbers of well-trained 
cooks and well-behaved clerks? Is the 
purpose of the nation to form cheap 
skilled labor for the manufacturer, or is 
the aim of society to form intelligent, edu- 
cated citizens? 
The high-school and college courses 
advised by the professors and elected by 
the student are with reference to the voca- 
tion in life, to business and to trade. Our
-P-A-G-E-105
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 73 
schools, our high schools, our colleges and 
our universities are all animated with the 
same sordid aim of giving electives for 
early specialization in the art of money- 
getting. We may say with Mill that our 
schools and colleges give no true educa- 
tion, no true culture. We drift to the 
status of Egypt and India with their 
castes of early trained mechanics, profes- 
sionals and shopkeepers. Truly educated 
men we shall have none. We shall be- 
come a nation of narrow-minded _philis- 
tines, well contented with their mediocrity.

Tue great thinker, John Stuart Mill, 
insists that “the great business of every 
rational being is the strengthening and 
enlarging of his own intellect and charac- 
ter. The empirical knowledge which the 
‘world demands, which is the stock in trade 
of money-getting, we would leave the 
world to provide for itself.” We must 
make our system of education such “that 
a great man may be formed by it, and 
there will be a manhood in your little men 
of which you do not dream. We must 
have a system of education capable of 
forming great minds.” Education must 
aim at the bringing out of the genius in 
man. Do we achieve such aim by the 
1%
-P-A-G-E-107
  PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 75 
formation of philistine-specialists and 
young petty-minded artisans? 
“The very cornerstone of an educa- 
tion,” Mill tells us, “intended to form 
great minds, must be the recognition of 
the principle, that the object is to call 
forth the greatest possible quantity of in- 
tellectual power, and to inspire the intens- 
est love of truth; and this without a par- 
ticle of regard to the results to which the 
exercise of that power may lead.” With 
us the only love of truth is the one that 
leads to the shop, the bank and the count- 
ing-house. 
The home controls the school and the 
college. As long as the home is domi- 
nated by commercial ideals, the school will 
turn out mediocre tradesmen. 
This, however, is one of the character- 
istic types of the American home: the 
mother thinks of dresses, fashions and par- 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  76 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
ties. The daughter twangs and thrums 
on the piano, makes violent attempts at 
singing that sound as “the crackling of 
thorns under a pot,” is passionately fond 
of shopping, dressing and visiting. Both, 
mother and daughter, love society, show 
and gossip. The father works in some 
business or at some trade and loves sports 
and games. Not a spark of refinement 
and culture, not a redeeming ray of love 
of knowledge and of art, lighting up the 
commonplace and frivolous life of the 
family. What wonder that the children 
of ten and eleven can hardly read and 
write, are little brutes and waste away 
their precious life of childhood in the close, 
dusty, overheated rooms of the early 
grades of some elementary school? Com- 
mercial mediocrity is raised at home and 
cultivated in the school. 
“As a means of educating the many, 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
  PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 77 
the universities are absolutely null,” ex- 
claims Mill. The attainments of any 
kind required for taking all the de- 
grees conferred by these bodies are, at 
Cambridge, utterly contemptible.” Our 
American schools, with their ideals of 
money-earning capacities, our colleges 
glorying in their athletics, football teams 
and courses for professional and business 
specializations would have been regarded 
by Mill as below contempt. 
What indeed is the worth of an educa- 
tion that does not create even as much as 
an ordinary respect for learning and love 
of truth, and that prizes knowledge in 
terms of hard cash? What is the educa- 
tional worth of a college or of a university 
which suppresses its most gifted students 
by putting them under the ban of disor- 
derly behavior, because of not conforming 
to commonplace mannerisms? What is
-P-A-G-E-110
    78 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
the educational value of a university which 
is but a modern edition of a gladiatorial 
school with a smattering of the humani- 
ties? What is the educational value of an 
institution of learning that expels its best 
students because they “attract more at- 
tention than their professors”? What is 
the intellectual level of a college that 
expels from its courses the ablest of its 
students for some slight infringement, and 
that an involuntary one, under the pre- 
text that it is done for the sake of class- 
discipline, “for the general good of the 
class”? What travesty on education is a 
system that suppresses genius in the inter- 
est of mediocrity? What is the cultural, 
the humanistic value of an education that 
puts a prize on mediocrity?
-P-A-G-E-111

Discrpiine, fixed habits approved by the 
pedagogue are specially enforced in our 
schools. To this may be added some 
“culture” in the art of money-getting in 
the case of the boys, while in the case of 
girls the esthetic training of millinery 
and dressmaking may be included. The 
colleges, in addition to class-discipline 
looked after by the professors and col- 
lege-authorities, are essentially an organi- 
zation of hasty-pudding clubs, football 
associations and athletic corporations. 
What is the use of a college if not for its 
games? Many regard the college as use- 
ful for the formation of business acquaint- 
ances in later life. Others again consider 
19
-P-A-G-E-112
80 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
the college a good place for learning fine 
manners. In other words, the college and 
the school are for athletics, good manners, 
business companionship, mechanical arts 
and money-getting. They are for any- 
thing but education. 
We have become so used to college ath- 
letics that it appears strange and possibly 
absurd to demand of a college the culti- 
vation of man’s genius. Who expects to 
find an intellectual atmosphere among the 
great body of our college undergraduates? 
Who expects of our schools and colleges 
true culture and the cultivation of a taste 
for literature, art and science? A dean, 
an ‘unusually able man, of one of the 
prominent Eastern colleges tells me that 
he and his friends are very pessimistic 
about his students and especially about the 
great body of undergraduate students. 
Literature, art, science have no interest 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 81 
for the student; games and athletics fill 
his mental horizon. 
In the training of our children, in the 
education of our young, we think that 
discipline, obedience to paternal and ma- 
ternal commands, whether rational or ab- 
surd, are of the utmost importance. We 
do not realize that in such a scheme of 
training we fail to cultivate the child’s 
critical faculties, but only succeed in sup- 
pressing the child’s individuality. We 
only break his will-power and originality. 
We also prepare the ground for future 
nervous and mental maladies character- 
ized by their fears, indecisions, hesitations, 
diffidence, irritability, lack of individu- 
ality and absence of self-control. 
We laugh at the Chinese, because they 
bandage the feet of their girls, we ridicule 
those who cripple their chest and mutilate 
their figure by the tight lacing of their cor-

82 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
sets, but we fail to realize the baneful ef- 
fects of submitting the young minds to the 
grindstone of our educational discipline. 
I have known good fathers and mothers 
who have unfortunately been so imbued 
with the necessity of disciplining the child 
that they have crushed the child’s spirit in 
the narrow bonds of routine and custom. 
How can we expect to get great men and 
women when from infancy we train our 
children to conform to the philistine ways 
of Mrs. Grundy? 
In our schools and colleges, habits, dis- 
cipline and behavior are specially empha- 
sized by our teachers, instructors and pro- 
fessors. Our deans and professors think 
more of red tape, of “points,” of discipline 
than of study; they think more of author- 
itative suggestion than of critical in- 
struction. The pedagogue fashions the 
pupil after his own image. The pro-
-P-A-G-E-115
  
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 83 
fessor, with his disciplinarian tactics, 
forces the student into the imbecile mum- 
my-like mannerism of Egyptian pedantry 
and into the barrack-regulations of class- 
etiquette. Well may professors of our 
“war-schools” claim that the best educa- 
tion is given in military academies. They 
are right, if discipline is education. But 
why not the reformatory, the asylum and 
the prison? 
We trust our unfortunate youth to the 
Procrustean bed of the mentally obtuse, 
hide-bound pedagogue. We desiccate, 
sterilize, petrify and embalm our youth in 
keeping with the rules of our Egyptian 
code and in accordance with the Confucian 
regulations of our school-clerks and col- 
lege mandarins. Our children learn by 
rote and are guided by routine.
-P-A-G-E-116

Bete in a barbaric stage, we are afraid 
of thought. We are under the errone- 
ous belief that thinking, study, causes 
nervousness and mental disorders. In my 
practice as physician in nervous and men- 
tal diseases, I can say without hesitation 
that I have not met a single case of nerv- 
ous or mental trouble caused by too 
much thinking or overstudy. ‘This is at 
present the opinion of the best psycho- 
pathologists. What produces nervous- 
ness is worry, emotional excitement and 
lack of interest in the work. But that 
is precisely what we do with our children. 
We do not take care to develop a love of 
knowledge in their early life for fear of 
brain injury, and then when it is late to 
84
-P-A-G-E-117
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 85 
acquire the interest, we force them to study, 
and we cram them and feed them and stuff 
them like geese. What you often get is 
fatty degeneration of the mental liver. 
If, however, you do not neglect the 
child between the second and third year, 
and see to it that the brain should not be 
starved, should have its proper function, 
like the rest of the bodily organs, by de- 
veloping an interest in intellectual activ- 
ity and love of knowledge, no forcing of 
the child to study is afterwards requisite. 
The child will go on by himself,—he 
will derive intense enjoyment from his 
intellectual activity, as he does from his 
games and physical exercise. The child 
will be stronger, healthier, sturdier than 
the present average child, with its purely 
animal activities and total neglect of brain- 
function. His physical and mental de- 
velopment will go apace. He will not be   
 
-P-A-G-E-118
86 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
a barbarian with animal proclivities and a 
strong distaste for knowledge and mental 
enjoyment, but he will be a strong, 
healthy, thinking man. 
Besides, many a mental trouble will be 
prevented in adult-life. The child will 
acquire knowledge with the same ease as 
he learns to ride the bicycle or play ball. 
By the tenth year, without almost any ef- 
fort, the child will acquire the knowledge 
which at present the best college-graduate 
obtains with infinite labor and pain. 
That this can be accomplished I can say 
with authority; I know it as a fact from 
my own experience with child-life. 
From an economical standpoint alone, 
think of the saving it would ensure for 
society. Consider the fact that our chil- 
dren spend nearly eight years in the com- 
mon school, studying spelling and arith- 
metic, and do not know them when they 
graduate! Think of the eight years of 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 87 
waste of school buildings and salaries for 
the teaching force. However, our real 
object is not economy, but the develop- 
ment of a strong, healthy, great race of 
genius. 
As fathers and mothers it may interest 
you to learn of one of those boys who were 
brought up in the love and enjoyment of 
knowledge for its own sake. At the age 
of twelve, when other children of his age 
are hardly able to read and spell, and drag 
a miserable mental existence at the apron 
strings of some antiquated school-dame, 
the boy is intensely enjoying courses in 
the highest branches of mathematics and 
astronomy at one of our foremost univer- 
sities. The Iliad and the Odyssey are 
known to him by heart, and he is deeply 
interested in the advanced work of Classi- 
cal Philology. He is able to read He- 
rodotus, Auschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, 
Aristophanes, Lucian and other Greek 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  88 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
writers with the same zest and ease as our 
schoolboy reads his Robinson Crusoe or 
the productions of Cooper and Henty. 
The boy has a fair understanding of Com- 
parative Philology and Mythology. He 
is well versed in Logic, Ancient History, 
American History and has a general in- 
sight into our polities and into the ground- 
work of our Constitution. At the same 
time he is of an extremely happy disposi- 
tion, brimming over with humor and fun. 
His physical condition is splendid, his 
_ cheeks glow -with health. Many a girl 
would envy his complexion. Being above 
five feet four he towers above the average 
boy of his age. His physical constitution, 
weight, form and hardihood of organs, far 
surpasses that of the ordinary schoolboy. 
He looks like a boy of sixteen. He is 
healthy, strong and sturdy. 
The philistine-pseudagogues, the self- 
contented school-autocrats are so imbued
-P-A-G-E-121
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 89 
with the fear of intellectual activity and 
with the superstitious dread of early men- 
tal education, they are so obsessed with 
the morbid phobia of human reflective 
powers, they are so deluded by the belief 
that study causes disease that they eagerly 
adhere to the delusion, to quote from a 
school-superintendent’s letter, about the 
boy being “in a sanitarium, old and worn- 
out.” No doubt, the cramming, the rou- 
tine, the rote, the mental and moral tyr- 
anny of the principal and school-superin- 
tendent do tend to nervous degeneracy 
and mental break-down. Poor old col- 
lege owls, academic barn-yard-fowls and 
worn-out sickly school-bats, you are panic- 
stricken by the power of sunlight, you are 
in agonizing, in mortal terror of critical, 
reflective thought, you dread and suppress 
the genius of the young. 
We do not appreciate the genius har- 
      
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  
  90 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
bored in the average child, and we let it 
lie fallow. We are mentally poor, not 
because we lack riches, but because we do 
not know how to use the wealth of mines, 
the hidden treasures, the now inaccessible 
mental powers which we possess. 
In speaking of our mental capacities, 
Francis Galton, I think, says that we are 
in relation to the ancient Greeks what the 
Bushmen and Hottentots are in relation to 
us. Galton and many other learned men 
regard the modern European races as infe- 
rior to the Hellenicrace. They are wrong, 
and I know from experience that they are 
wrong. It rests in our hands either to 
remain inferior barbarians or to rival and 
even surpass in brilliancy the genius of 
the ancient Hellenes. We can develop 
into a great race by the proper education 
of man’s genius.
-P-A-G-E-123
  XVI 
One other important point claims our 
attention in the process of education of 
man’s genius. We must immunize our 
children against mental microbes, as we 
vaccinate our babies against small-pox. 
The cultivation of critical judgment and 
the knowledge of evil are two. powerful 
constituents that form the antitoain for 
the neutralization of the virulent towins 
produced by mental microbes. At the 
same time we should not neglect proper 
conditions of mental hygiene. We should 
not people the child’s mind with ghost- 
stories, with absurd beliefs in the super- 
natural, and with articles of creed charged 
with brimstone and pitch from the bowels 
of hell. We must guard the child against 
91
-P-A-G-E-124
  92 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
all evil fears, superstitions, prejudices and 
credulity. 
We should counteract the baneful in- 
fluences of the pathogenic, pestiferous, 
mental microbes which now infest our 
social air, since the child, not having yet 
formed the antitoxin of critical judgment 
and knowledge of evil, has not the power 
of resisting mental infection, and is thus 
very susceptible to mental contagion on 
account of his extreme suggestibility. 
The cultivation of credulity, the absence 
of critical judgment and of recognition 
of evil, with consequent increase of sug- 
gestibility, make man an easy prey to 
all kinds of social delusions, mental epi- 
demics, religious crazes, financial manias, 
and political plagues, which have been the 
baleful pest of aggregate humanity in all 
ages. : 
The immunization of children, the de-
-P-A-G-E-125
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS . 93 
velopment of resistance to mental germs 
whether moral, immoral or religious, can 
only be effected by the medical man with 
a psychological and psychopathological 
training. Just as science, philosophy and 
art have gradually passed out of the con- 
trol of the priest, so now we find that the 
control of mental and moral life is grad- 
ually passing away from under the influ- 
ence of the church into the hands of the 
medical psychopathologist. 
The physical life of the nation is now 
gradually being regulated by medical sci- 
ence with a consequent decrease of disease 
and mortality. Gradually and slowly the 
school begins to feel the need of medical 
advice, both as to the health of the pupils 
and their more efficient training. Gradu- 
ally the medical man assumes the respon- 
sibility of guiding the teacher and telling 
him why the pupils are defective in their 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  94 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
. studies and why the pedantic methods of 
academic pedagogy are arid and sterile. 
In some cases the doctor actually under- 
takes the training of the young. Thus 
the Italian doctor, Maria Montessori, 
from the education of defective children 
has finally undertaken, with immense, al- 
most phenomenal, success, the training 
and education of normal children. 
As we look forward into the future 
we begin to see that the school is com- 
ing under the control of the medical 
man. The medical man free from super- 
stitions and prejudices, possessed of the 
science of mind and body, is to assume 
in the future the supervision of the educa- 
tion of the nation. 
The schoolmaster and the schoolma’am 
with their narrow-minded, pedantic pseu- 
dogogics are gradually losing prestige 
and passing away, while the medical man
-P-A-G-E-127
  PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 95 
alone is able to cope with the serious 
threatening danger of national mental 
degeneration. Just as the medical pro- 
fession now saves the nation from physi- 
cal degeneration and works for the physi- 
cal regeneration of the body-politic, so 
will the medical profession of the fu- 
ture assume the duty of saving the nation 
from mental and. moral decline, from de- 
generation into a people of fear-pos- 
sessed, mind-racked psychopathics and 
neurotics, with broken wills and crushed 
individualities on the one hand, accompan- 
ied, on the other hand, by the still worse 
affliction and incurable malady of a self- 
contented mediocrity and a hopeless, Chi- 
nese philistinism. 
There are in the United States about 
two hundred thousand insane, while the 
victims of psychopathic, mental maladies 
may be counted by the millions. Insan-
-P-A-G-E-128
  96 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
ity can be greatly alleviated, but much, 
if not all, of that psychopathic mental 
misery known as functional mental dis- 
ease is entirely preventable. It is the 
result of our pitiful, wretched, brain- 
starving, mind-crippling methods of edu- 
cation.
-P-A-G-E-129
XVII 
In my work of mental and nervous dis- 
eases I become more and more convinced 
of the preponderant influence of early 
childhood in the causation of psychopathic 
mental maladies. Most, in fact all, of 
those functional mental diseases originate 
in early childhood. A couple of concrete 
cases will perhaps best illustrate my point: 
The patient is a young man of 26. He 
suffers from intense melancholic depres- 
sion, often amounting to agony. He is 
possessed by the fear of having committed 
the unpardonable sin. He thinks that he 
is damned to suffer tortures in hell for all 
eternity. I cannot go here into the de- 
tails of the case, but an examination of 
97 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  98 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
the patient by the hypnoidal state clearly 
traced his present condition to the influ- 
ence of an old woman, a Sunday school 
teacher, who infected him with those vir- 
’ ulent germs in his very early childhood, 
about the age of five. Let me read to you 
a paragraph from the patient’s own ac- 
count: “It is difficult to place the begin- 
ning of my abnormal fear. It certainly 
originated from doctrines of hell which I 
heard in early childhood, particularly from 
a rather ignorant elderly woman, who 
taught Sunday school. My early reli- 
gious thought was chiefly concerned with 
the direful eternity of torture that might 
be awaiting me, if I was not good enough 
to be saved.” 
Another patient of mine, a clergyman’s 
wife, was extremely nervous, depressed, 
and suffered from insomnia, from night- 
mares, from panophobia, general fear,
-P-A-G-E-131
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 99 
dread of the unknown, from claustro- 
phobia, fear of remaining alone, fear of 
darkness and numerous other fears and 
insistent ideas, into the details of which I 
cannot go here. By means of the hypnoi- 
dal state the symptoms were traced to 
impressions of early childhood; when at 
the age of five, the patient was suddenly 
confronted by a maniacal woman. The 
child was greatly frightened, and since 
that time she became possessed by the fear 
of insanity. When the patient gave birth 
to her child, she was afraid the child would 
become insane; many a time she even had 
a feeling that the child was insane. Thus 
the fear of insanity is traced to an expe- 
rience of early childhood, an experience 
which, having become subconscious, is 
manifesting itself persistently in the pa- 
tient’s consciousness. 
The patient’s parents were very reli-
-P-A-G-E-132
  100 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
gious, and the child was brought up not 
only in the fear of God, but also in the 
fear of hell and the devil. Being sensi- 
tive and imaginative, the devils of the 
gospel were to her stern realities. She 
had a firm belief in “diabolical posses- 
sions” and “unclean spirits”; the legend 
of Jesus exorcising in the country of the 
Gadarenes unclean spirits, whose name 
is Legion, was to her a tangible reality. 
She was brought up on brimstone and 
pitch, with everlasting fires of the “bot- 
tomless pit” for sinners and unbelievers. 
In the hypnoidal state she clearly remem- 
bered the preacher, who used every Sun- 
day to give her the horrors by his pictur- 
esque descriptions of the tortures of the 
“bottomless pit.” She was in anguish 
over the unsolved question: ‘Do little 
sinner-girls go to hell?’ This fear of hell
-P-A-G-E-133
  PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 101 
made the little girl feel depressed and 
miserable and poisoned many a cheerful 
moment of her life. 
What a lasting effect and what a mel- 
ancholy gloom this fear of ghosts and of 
unclean spirits of the bottomless pit pro- 
duced on this young life may be judged 
from the following facts: When the pa- 
tient was about eleven years old, a young 
girl, a friend of hers, having noticed the 
patient’s fear of ghosts, played on her one 
of those silly, practical jokes, the effect 
of which on sensitive natures is often 
disastrous and lasting. The girl dis- 
guised herself as a ghost, in a white sheet, 
and appeared to the patient, who was just 
on the point of falling asleep. The child 
shrieked in terror and fainted. Since 
that time the patient suffered from night- 
mares and was mortally afraid to sleep
-P-A-G-E-134
  102 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
alone; she passed many a night in a state 
of excitement, frenzied with the fear of 
apparitions and ghosts. 
When about the age of seventeen, she 
apparently freed herself from the belief 
in ghosts and unclean powers. But the 
fear acquired in her childhood did not 
lapse; it persisted subconsciously and 
manifested itself in the form of uncon- 
trollable fears. She was afraid to remain 
alone in a room, especially in the evening. 
Thus, once when she had to go upstairs 
alone to pack her trunks, a gauzy garment 
called forth the experience of her ghost- 
fright; she had the illusion of seeing a 
ghost, and fell fainting to the floor.. Un- 
less specially treated, fears acquired in 
childhood last through life. 
“Every ugly thing,” says Mosso, the 
great Italian physiologist, “told to the 
child, every shock, every fright given him,
-P-A-G-E-135
  
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 103 
will remain like minute splinters in the 
flesh, to torture him all his life long. 
“An old soldier whom I asked what his 
greatest fears had been, answered me 
thus: ‘I have only had one, but it pur- 
sues me still. I am nearly seventy years 
old, I have looked death in the face I do 
not know how many times; I have never 
lost heart in any danger, but when I pass 
a little old church in the shades of the 
forest, or a deserted chapel in the moun- 
tains, I always remember a neglected ora- 
tory in my native village, and I shiver and 
look around, as though seeking the corpse 
of a murdered man which I once saw car- 
ried into it when a child, and with which 
‘an old servant wanted to shut me up to 
make me good.’”” Here, too, experiences 
of early childhood have persisted subcon- 
sciously throughout lifetime.  
-P-A-G-E-136

I apprrat to you, fathers and mothers, 
and to you, liberal-minded readers, asking 
you to turn your attention to the educa- 
tion of your children, to the training of 
the young generation of future citizens. 
I do not appeal to our official educators, 
to our scientific, psychological pseuda- 
gogues, to the clerks of our teaching shops, 
—for they are beyond all hope. From 
that quarter I expect nothing but attacks 
and abuse. We cannot possibly expect 
of the philistine-educator and mandarin- 
pseudagogue the adoption of different 
views of education. We should not keep 
new wine in old goat-skins. The present 
school-system squanders the resources of 
the country and wastes the energies, the 
lives of our children. Like Cato our ery 
104
-P-A-G-E-137
  PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 105 
should be Carthago delenda est,—the 
school-system should be abolished and 
with it should go the present psychologi- 
zing educator, the schoolmaster and the 
schoolma’am. 
Fathers and mothers, you keep in your 
hands the fate of the young generation. 
You are conscious of the great responsi- 
bility, of the vast, important task laid upon 
you by the education of your children. 
For, according to the character of the 
training and education given to the young, 
they may be made a sickly host of nervous 
wrecks and miserable wretches; or they 
may be formed into a narrow-minded, 
bigoted, mediocre crowd of self-contented 
“cultured” philistines, bat-blind to evil; or 
they may be made a great race of genius 
with powers of rational control of their 
latent, potential, reserve energy. The 
choice remains with you.

PRECOCITY IN CHILDREN * 
By precocity I mean the manifestation of 
the child’s mental functions at a period 
earlier than the one observed in the past 
and present generations of children. 
In the course of his growth and de- 
velopment the individual unfolds his inner 
powers through acquisition of the stored- 
up experiences of previous generations. 
The well known biogenetic law may, with 
some modifications, be applied to mental 
life. The development of the individual

is an abbreviated reproduction of the evo- 
lution of the species. Briefly put: Onto- 
genesis is an epitome of Phylogenesis. 
This biogenetic law holds true in the do- 
main of education. The stored-up ex- 
periences of the race are condensed, fore- 
shortened, and recapitulated in the child’s 
life history. This process of progressive 
“precocity,” or of foreshortening of edu- 
cation, has been going on unconsciously in 
the course of human evolution. We have 
reached a stage when man can be made 
conscious of this fundamental process, 
thus getting control over, his own growth 
and development. 
Although the process of foreshortening 
of education has been taking place 
throughout the history of mankind, and 
especially of civilized humanity, still the 
process has remained imperceptible on ac- 
count of its extremely slow rate of prog-

ress. Hence the fact of “precocity,” or 
of early development of children, has been 
hitherto regarded as rare, as phenomenal. 
Like all rare phenomena, precocity, or 
early child development, is considered as 
unique, as abnormal, and even as patho- 
logical. In fact, many still regard pre- 
cocity: as some form of malady akin to 
mental alienation. 
It is well to bear in mind that phe- 
nomena, at first scarce and rare, may 
under favorable conditions become suf- 
ficiently numerous to be quite common. 
In fact, we may lay it down as a law that 
all discoveries, inventions, and changes in 
general, economical, political, social, men- 
tal, moral, and religious, first appear on 
a small scale in limited areas from which 
they spread in various directions. Or- 
ganisms start, as variations or mutations, 
from minute nuclei of growth; species 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
    110 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
have their origin in small centres and re- 
stricted areas. A new species may begin 
with some apparently insignificant varia- 
tion which may grow and develop, and 
which, from a certain standpoint, may be 
regarded as an abnormality. 
What at present is considered as “pre- 
cocity,” and hence as an abnormality, may 
really be the foreshadowing of the future. 
The apparently precocious variation may 
and will turn out a normal phenomenon. 
The stone which the builders refused is 
become the head stone of the corner. 
Early education, precocity, is to become 
the corner stone of human life. At pres- 
ent the preliminary period of child educa- 
tion is unduly retarded to the detriment 
of the individual and society. 
The truth is, we do not realize the im- 
portance of early training. We begin 
education late in the child’s life, when dis-
-P-A-G-E-143
  
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS TDL 
positions have become formed and habits 
have become rigid. This delay seriously 
injures the growth of the child by lower- 
ing the level of mental activity. The 
critical points of formation of mental in- 
terests are allowed to slip by, leaving the 
individual irresponsive to mental, «esthetic, 
and moral interests. The critical turning 
points, when the best energies could be 
brought out, are not taken care of at the 
right moment. 
The mental functions become pre- 
maturely atrophied and degenerated. 
When we later on attempt to awaken 
those ‘functions, we are surprised to find 
them absent. We labor under the false 
impression that the child is naturally 
inapt and deficient. To make up for this 
apparent deficiency we force the child’s 
mind into narrow channels, crippling and 
deforming it into mean mediocrity. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
    112 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
child is run into the rigid moulds of home, 
school, and college with the result of 
permanent mutilation of originality and 
genius. The individual is deformed, be- 
cause the critical spirit of inquiry and 
originality is racked on the Procrustes’ 
bed of home-and school. The unfortunate 
thing about it is the firm belief that the 
crippled spirit of the child is a congenital 
mediocrity. Instead of shouldering the 
fault, we put the burden on Heredity. 
Darwinism with its spontaneous variation 
and hereditary transmission, Austro-Ger- 
manic Mendelism, accompanied by a wide- 
spread propaganda of Eugenics, have 
blotted out from view the far more fun- 
damental factors of environment and edu- 
cation which play such a paramount réle 
in man’s life. 
We may profit by recent studies in 
Psychopathology. In my investigations
-P-A-G-E-145
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 113 
I have shown the important réle which 
early child experience plays in the pa- 
tient’s life. Psychopathic affections can 
be traced to child fears which become 
afterwards reinforced by unfavorable con- 
ditions of life. This is formulated in my 
works on Psychopathology. . Psychopa- 
thology clearly brings out the significant 
fact that a good start in early childhood 
is of the utmost consequence to the in- 
dividual. Only a good education in early 
life can save man from the innumerable 
psychopathic maladies to which he is, sub- 
ject. The seeds of vicious habits and of 
criminal tendencies can be eliminated in 
early childhood. 
Early development or what is termed 
“precocity” in children will not only pre- 
vent vice, crime, and disease, but will 
strengthen the individual along all lines, 
physical, mental, and moral. We should
-P-A-G-E-146
  114 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
be careful not to cast the child’s mind 
into ready made moulds, not to subject 
his mind, his character to the yoke of 
meaningless mannerisms and rigid formal- 
ities. We should have respect for the 
child’s personality. We should remem- 
ber that there is genius in every healthy, 
normal child. 
Weare blind to the child’s latent genius, 
because we look to brute force as our 
standard. Like savages, we are afraid of 
genius, especially when it is manifested 
as “precocity in children.” This abject 
fear of genius and of precocity is one of 
the most pernicious philistine supersti- 
tions, causing the retardation of the prog- 
ress of humanity. The fear of mental 
precocity is essentially the phobia of the 
inveterate philistine. 
We should bear in mind that the phil- 
istine is an insignificant, though exact
-P-A-G-E-147
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 115 
part of a huge social machine, of a Frank- 
enstein “kultur” before which the phil- 
istine prostrates himself in dust, a social 
monster of which he is proud to form an 
irresponsible mite. Whether he be an 
atom of a political organization, of a na- 
tion, or of a military kultur-system, the 
philistine is trained to be content to play 
the same ignoble, slavish réle of submis- 
sion, obedience, and _ irresponsibility. 
Without personal conscience, without per- 
sonal will, without personal initiative, the 
impersonal philistine is like the stupid 
genie of Aladdin’s lamp who slavishly 
obeys the master of the magic lamp. 
The present horrible European war 
(predicted in this volume several years 
before the onset of the war. See pp. 30, 
81) is the unfortunate, but natural out- 
come of philistine education and philistine 
life. The immediate cause of the war may
-P-A-G-E-148
  116 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
be traced to politics, greed, competition, to 
commercial, industrial, cultural, national, 
international, and racial complications. 
At bottom, however, the present Kuro- 
pean war is ultimately due to our per- 
nicious system of training, the bane of 
our industrial, social life. Millions of men 
are drilled and disciplined to act as autom- 
ata; men are trained from childhood, 
at home, school, college, and university 
to surrender their individual judgment, 
and follow blindly an alleged “social con- 
sciousness,” entrusted, by a set of phil- 
istine bureaucrats, to superior leaders, to 
generals, admirals, and field-marshals. 
Men are hypnotized by a pernicious and 
vicious system of training and quasi-edu- 
cation to consider it a high, sacred ideal 
to obey implicitly the will of a few of- 
ficials and diplomats, to attack, plunder 
and slaughter at the command of gen- '

erals and officers, in the interest of a 
plutocratic oligarchy, hallowed by the 
vague shibboleth: “Flag, Country, Pa- 
triotism.” * The youth of nations is de- 
bauched with the belief in the supreme 
” *“The cheapest form of pride,’ says Schopen- 
hauer, “is national pride; for if a man is proud 
of his own nation it follows that he has no quali- 
ties of his own of which he can be proud; other- 
wise he would not have recourse to those which he 
shares with his fellow-men. . . . Every miserable 
fool who has nothing at all of which he can be 
proud adopts as a last resource pride in the nation 
to which he belongs; he is ready and glad to de- 
fend all its faults and follies, tooth and nail, thus 
reimbursing himself for his own inferiority. ... 
National character is only another name for the 
particular form which the littleness, perversity, and 
baseness of mankind take in every country.” ... 
“Narrowness, prejudice, vanity, and self-interest 
are the main elements of, patriotism.” . . . “Does 
not all history show that whenever a king is firmly 
established on the throne, and the people reach 
some degree of prosperity, he uses it to lead an 
army, like a band of robbers, against adjoining 
countries? Are not almost all wars ultimately un- 
dertaken for purpose of plunder?” . . . Schopen- 
hauer prophetically warns his countrymen: “All 
war is a matter of robbery, and the Germans 
should take that as a warning.”

grandeur of delivering their personal re- 
sponsibility in the keeping of a handful 
of Byzantine bureaucrats, irresponsible 
junkers, and half-crazed Cesars. 
The principle “Be Childlike” is para- 
mount in the education of mankind. The 
child represents the future, all the pos- 
sibilities, all the coming greatness of the 
human race. We, the adults, are con- 
taminated by the brutal passions and vices 
incident to the struggle for existence and 
self-preservation. 
Plasticity of mind is characteristic of 
genius. Plasticity of mind and body is 
preéminently characteristic of the child.. 
Adaptability and plasticity are found in 
all young tissue, muscle, gland, and nerve. 
As the organism ages, becomes differ- 
entiated, and adapted to special functions 
and conditions of life, it loses its original 
plasticity. The tissues become fixed and
-P-A-G-E-151
  PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 119 
the functions set. The adult’s brain and 
mind begin to work in ruts. The child is 
superior to the adult. 
The child looks at the world with eyes 
simple, clear, bright, not blinded by the 
heavy scales of traditions, superstitions, 
and prejudices of remote ages. The in- 
tricate worries, complex fears, selfish mo- 
tives, brutal passions, greed, revenge, 
malice, vice, enmity do not as yet mar the 
soul of the child. Artificial needs, strong 
animal passions have no firm hold on the 
child’s mind. The child’s mind is purer, 
fresher, brighter, far more original than 
the adult intelligence with its philistine 
notions and hide-bound habits of thought 
and belief. 
With age the mind becomes specialized 
and degraded in quality. Unless checked 
by a good education and by a persistent 
course of mental activity, intellectual and
-P-A-G-E-152
  
  120 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
other mental interests, the adult mind is 
apt to deteriorate. Unless controlled by 
a good education and by intense mental 
interests, free from service to animal 
needs, the emotions of self-regard, the im- 
pulse of self-preservation with its fear in- 
stinct gradually gain in man the upper 
hand. In the child, on the contrary, the 
personal interests are relatively weak, and 
fluctuating, hence the possibility of pure 
disinterestedness, pure curiosity, love of 
learning, the root of all originality pres- 
ent both in genius and the child. The 
child presents the innocence and gentle- 
ness of human genius, the adult philistine 
is the embodiment of the force and cun- 
ning of the brute. 
We should not be scared by the bug- 
bear of precocity. We should awaken 
man’s genius by giving the child an early, 
a “precocious” education. We should
-P-A-G-E-153
    
PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 121 
bear in mind that the knowledge of our 
schoolboys and schoolgirls far surpasses 
that of the ancient sages or of the medi- 
zval doctors. We should learn to under- 
stand and to utilize the process of pro- 
gressive foreshortening of race acquisi- 
tions in the history of the individual. 
The great biologist, Professor C. S. 
Minot, comes to a similar conclusion, as 
the result of his profound biological in- 
vestigations: “I believe,” says Minot, “that 
this principle of psychological develop- 
ment, paralleling the career of physical 
development, needs to be more considered 
in arranging our educational plans. For 
if it be true that the decline in the power 
of learning is most rapid at first, it is evi- 
dent that we want to make as much use 
of the early years as possible—that the 
tendency, for instance, which has existed 
in many of our universities, to postpone
-P-A-G-E-154
    122 PHILISTINE AND GENIUS 
the period of entrance into college, is 
biologically an erroneous tendency. It 
would be better to have the young man get 
to college earlier, graduate earlier, get 
into practical life or into professional 
schools earlier, while the power of learning 
is greater.” 
I may say that within my experience 
children who had the advantage of an 
early education and training manifested 
a higher grade of intellectual and moral 
life, a far better state of physical health 
than children brought up under the pres- 
ent retarding and crippling system of edu- 
cation. In conclusion I may add that in 
order to gain access to man’s Reserve 
Energy we must have recourse to early 
child education, to the much maligned, 
and greatly feared “Precocity in Chil- 
dren,”

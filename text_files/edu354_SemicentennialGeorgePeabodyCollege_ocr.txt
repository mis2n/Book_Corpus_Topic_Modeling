Please say for me to the students, faculty, and 
friends who participated so generously and ear- 
nestly in the successful conduct of our Semicen- 
tennial that the College is very grateful indeed for 
the magnificent services which they rendered. 
The several hundred students on the various 
committees attended to their duties so well that I 
was never prouder of the teaching profession in 
my life. Everything went off with such great 
precision, and yet displaying such simple beauty, 
that all who witnessed it from various parts of 
the United States were greatly impressed. Of 
course, I knew that it was the hard work of the 
various committees of students and faculty for 
some time previous and during the exercises 
which caused our distinguished friends from a dis- 
tance to wonder and admire as they did.

  4 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
EDITORIAL NOTE 
  
The Semicentennial Celebration of George Peabody College for 
Teachers was a genuine Golden Jubilee. The very atmosphere was 
charged with thanksgiving and aspiration. The addresses were all 
of a high order, some of them notable. 
The first day chosen for beginning the Golden Jubilee was the one 
hundred and thirtieth anniversary of the birth of George Peabody. 
As was fitting, the keynote of that day’s proceedings was to render 
tribute to our Founder as the pioneer and inspirer of modern phil- 
anthropy. 
The second day was devoted to the historic mission and achieve- 
ments of George Peabody College for Teachers, while the third day 
emphasized the Alumni as products of George Peabody College for 
Teachers and as the instrumentalities through which all Peabody 
achievements and ideals are to be realized. 
The following pages set forth the proceedings in the order of the 
program carried out on those three memorable days. 
This volume is primarily intended as a record of the Golden Jubilee, 
but it is also in a larger sense a portrayal of the Peabody spirit as 
embodied in the institution and its Alumni and as represented by a 
half century of service to the teacher's of the South and the Nation.

INTRODUCTION 
  
3 George Peabody College for Teachers was founded in 1875 by the 
trustees of the Peabody Education Fund, with the codperation of 
the University of Nashville and later of the erate of Tennessee. It 
opened its doors to students on December 1, 1875. \ \The choice of date 
for the celebration of its fiftieth anniversary was ‘fixed by the birth- 
day of George Peabody—February 18. 
The Golden Jubilee marked fifty years of checkered career and sin- 
gle-mindedness of purpose./ Peabody was fostered and controlled from 
1875 to 1909 by three boards—the trustees of the Peabody Education 
Fund, the trustees of the University of Nashville, and the State Board 
of Education of Tennessee. This arrangement made many difficulties 
inevitable, but surprisingly few disasters and many advantages re- 
sulted. The triple alliance was, on the whole, harmonious and effec- 
tive. It produced many stanch friends and supporters, genuinely | 
interested in the development of Peabody and in public education/ 
That George Peabody College for Teachers could wage a successful 
campaign for permanent endowment during the six years, 1903 to 
1909, speaks well for the curious and hazardous management by three 
boards which continued for thirty-four years. 
' At the end of this period, Peabody, in 1909, secured its independent 
charter and board of trustees as a corporation under the laws of Ten- 
nessee and came into possession of $1,750,000, endowment and build- 
ing fund, for starting upon a new phase of its historic mission. | That 
date and that event mark the realization of a long and persistent 
struggle. The obstacles met in this checkered career had been over- 
come, one after the other, by that single-mindedness of purpose in 
the training of teachers and the promotion of public education. 
The connection of this celebration with a larger span of time is 
easy to discover. ( [The University of Nashville, which loaned and 
finally donated all her grounds, buildings, and library to Peabody, 
reaches back to 1826. /Before the Civil War, the University of Nash- 
ville, under Chancellor Philip Lindsley and his son, Chancellor John 
Berrien Lindsley, became an honorable and dignified institution of 
higher learning, whose graduates exerted a commanding influence 
over the development of the South and Southwest, and, indeed, the
-P-A-G-E-6

whole nation. At one time in the 1850’s over a score of these grad- 
uates sat together in Washington as congressmen or senators in the 
councils of the national government. 
But the University of Nashville grew legally and directly out of 
Cumberland College (1806-1826), which in its turn succeeded David- 
son Academy (1785-1806), established by the legislature of North 
Carolina eleven years before Tennessee became a state. The succes- 
sion here is unbroken as regards property, control, educational pur- 
pose, and legal status, as shown clearly by the following from an act 
of the Tennessee legislature passed November 27, 1826: 
“That . . . there is hereby established at said place a univer- 
sity, to be known and distinguished by the corporate name of the 
‘University of Nashville,’ and that the corporate name of the trus- 
tees of Cumberland College be no longer used, and that the privileges, 
property, claims, and all rights of any description whatever, that 
were, or may be, vested either by law or equity in said trustees of 
Cumberland College, be henceforth vested in said University of Nash- 
ville. ie 
North Carolina granted Davidson Academy a tract of land covering 
roughly that part of Nashville now bounded by Broadway and Eighth 
Avenue (Spruce Street), and extending southward and eastward to 
the Cumberland River and the former Peabody campus, on Second 
Avenue (South Market Street). Rev. Thomas B. Craighead was 
president of Davidson Academy from 1785 to 1806, and of Cumber- 
land College from 1806 to 1809. He was succeeded by Dr. James 
Priestly, who was president from 1809 to 1816, and again in 1820-21. 
Then came the new era in name and in fact, Dr. Philip Lindsley leav- 
ing the presidency of Princeton University to become the president 
of the University of Nashville from 1826 to 1850. His son, Dr. John 
Berrien Lindsley, was chancellor from 1855 to 1870, and Gen. E. 
Kirby Smith from 1870 to 1875, when Peabody College was estab- 
lished. Then the College of Arts of the University of Nashville was 
discontinued by act of the General Assembly of the State of Tennes- 
see, passed March 28, 1875, and approved by Gov. James D. Porter on 
March 24, which is, in part (Chapter 104, Acts of 1875) : 
“Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, 
That the charter of the University of Nashville be so amended that 
the trustees may have the power, if in their judgment the interests 
of the institution require, to discontinue a course of instruction 
strictly collegiate and literary, . . . and make an arrangement
-P-A-G-E-7
  Introduction 7 
with the trustees of the ‘Peabody Fund,’ or other associations, for the 
establishment of a normal school.” 
“Thus was Peabody launched on its historic mission in 1875 by the 
trustees of the Peabody Education Fund in the home of the University 
of Nashville, which had been wrecked by war and had, besides its 
grounds and buildings, only a small income from the remnant of its 
former endowment. Gov. James D. Porter and Dr. John Berrien 
Lindsley, then secretary of the State Board of Education, codperated 
most effectively with Dr. Barnas Sears, first general agent of the 
Peabody Education Fund, in this new enterprise, which was to mean 
so much for the advancement of education through the special em- 
phasis on the training of teachers. / Peabody in its fifty years has had 
varied experiences, dotted with successes and defeats, ever changing 
to meet new demands, but keeping a true continuity by one steadfast, 
unchanging purpose. 
/ Dr. Eben S. Stearns was the president of Peabody Normal College 
from 1875 to 1887, its first period of struggle and experiment. /Dr. 
William H. Payne was the second president, during that period of 
buoyant vigor, from 1887 to 1901, when courses of study and faculty 
and students and influence were bountifully multiplied. Then fol- 
lowed a period of transition to Greater Peabody under Gov. James 
D. Porter as president from 1901 to 1909, when the present phase of 
Peabody was made possible.” From 1875 to 1909 financial support 
came by annual grants from four sources, amounting in all to $1,126,- 
540 from the Peabody Education Fund, $429,000 from the State of 
Tennessee, $127,909 from the fees of students, and $109,800 from 
the University of Nashville, besides the use of its grounds, buildings, 
and library, which later were donated towards endowment and build- 
ing fund (about $200,000 of the million and three-quarters available 
in 1910). The new era was founded on new endowment and trus- 
tees, new campus and buildings, reorganized courses of study and fac- 
ulty. Vital changes took place in all these respects during 1911 to 
1914. In 1911 instruction ceased on the old campus, and was resumed 
on the new in 1914 after three buildings were ready for classes. The 
past decade has been signalized by steady progress and the vigor of 
renewed youth. 
The continuity of Davidson Academy, Cumberland College, and the 
University of Nashville in source of income and in academic charac- 
ter was unbroken through the period of ninety years, from 1785 to 
1875. With the founding of Peabody College, in 1875, a new chapter 
 
-P-A-G-E-8
  8 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
of history was begun, with a new purpose and a new mission—that 
of training teachers scholastically and technically for all phases of 
public education. But the environment of the newly-founded Pea- 
body College became its ancestry in many respects and to a large 
degree. Peabody and this ancestry represent in very truth the cul- 
tural history of. Nashville, the educational development of that vast 
empire of the South and Southwest. From the viewpoint, then, of 
cultural and scholarly lineage Peabody might have been justified in 
undertaking to celebrate its one hundred and fortieth anniversary 
instead of its fiftieth.

THE PROCEEDINGS 
  
Peabody weather, halcyon days in the very midst of winter, gave 
the charm of spring to the three days of the Semicentennial Celebra- 
tion. The first dawned clear and crisply cool; slightly warmer was 
the second; the third glowed under a mild and genial sunshine, a 
well-nigh perfect day. Across the campus gleamed the white col- 
umns of the buildings in the bright glitter of the sunlight. The set- 
ting and “springtime in a month not its own” inspired elevated 
thoughts in the throngs that gathered and moved along the walks 
and crowded into the several places of meeting. Old friends met 
and greeted, ceremonies and processions were enacted, receptions and 
luncheons enlivened the scene; but everything was seemly, nothing 
commonplace. The majesty of occasion and setting pervaded these 
days and lifted the hearts of the celebrants. The externals alone 
would have been memorable, even without the larger interest and sig- 
nificance of the events commemorated. 
The general program of morning, afternoon, and evening exercises, 
as officially carried out, interspersed with receptions and luncheons, 
is printed on the following pages as a table of contents to this volume.

20 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIRST DAY 
  
The opening day of the Semicentennial Celebration was devoted to 
commemorating the life and influence of George Peabody. The ad- 
dresses, the sermon, the historical episodes, all joined in the effort to 
put in a true and favorable light the services of that great man to 
England, to America, and especially to the South and George Pea- 
body College for Teachers. The main theme of the day was: 
George Peabody, the pioneer and inspirer of 
modern philanthropy. 
GEORGE PEABODY—A RETROSPECT FROM THE 
VIEWPOINT OF HIS BIRTHPLACE 
  
ALDEN P. WHITE 
Judge of Probate and Insolvency Courts, Salem, Mass. 
  
This anniversary celebration interlocks, somewhat dramatically, 
with other anniversaries. 
An old city by the sea, in the North, is just now planning to observe 
next year the tercentenary of its founding. Three hundred years ago 
a few valiant souls drove in their stakes on the edge of the unfath- 
omed wilderness and held on. Accessions came from over the sea, 
and the tiny settlement adopted and kept the name of “Salem.” There 
our forefathers praised God and salted fish. Later, still praising God 
in their own way, they whipped Quakers for praising God in their 
way; later, still praising God, they hung witches. 
Withal, they, our Puritan forefathers and foremothers, were cou- 
rageous, heroic folk, who, upon the foundation of religion, the town 
meeting, and the common school, worked out a practical democracy 
which survived colony and province, revolted against the mother 
country, and became our Commonwealth. 
Each shipload of newcomers necessarily became pioneers and 
pushed the outposts of the settlement farther and farther into the 
wilderness. In time outlying parishes and villages sought independ- 
ence, and by a line or two in the crude records of the general court 
were incorporated as separate towns. Thus the vast and vague terri-
-P-A-G-E-23
  First Day,—White 21 
tory of Salem was successively reduced by a simple process of cleav- 
age. So that now, and for many years heretofore, the old city sits 
serenely straitened, pridefully mothering daughter communities by 
which she is surrounded and tightly squeezed. One of the largest of 
these communities, a hundred and twenty-six years after the arrival 
of the first planters, was formally set off and incorporated as an inde- 
pendent town under the name of “Danvers.” 
With the approach of the year 1852, the then citizens of Danvers 
prepared to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of its establishment. 
Such events have become common. The conventional processes are 
familiar. Town fathers take on added dignity. Leading citizens are 
put on the committee. The local historian prepares a discourse pain- 
fully suggestive to his audience of the duration of the century. The 
local poet invokes the good offices of Clio. Clergymen preach; school 
children sing; bands play; the fire department turns out in new red 
shirts; organizations and individuals march in the procession; vener- 
able citizens, honored by seats in low-necked barouches drawn by 
spans of horses, have the time of their lives, and contentedly say: 
“Now, O Lord, let thy servants depart in peace.” And the banquet! 
There the toastmaster, in the happiest spirit, introduces the Gov- 
ernor, the Congressman, the chairman of the Selectmen, and such 
sons who have won fame and fortune as may be reclaimed from the 
corners of the earth to the temporary confines of mother’s apron 
strings. But the humors of such occasions are incidental and superfi- 
cial. The celebrations are thoughtfully conceived and elaborated, and 
are carried out with dignity. Their culmination adds a distinct asset 
of self-respect to the municipality and settles its right to be referred to 
as a distinctively “old town.” 
In anticipation of the one hundredth anniversary of the incorpora- 
tion of Danvers, there had been sent, in the year 1852, a cordial invi- 
tation to be present, addressed to a man whose name we here and 
now, on this eighteenth of February, an anniversary of his birth, are 
attempting to honor. 
Some few years after the coming of John Endicott and his associ- 
ates and their truce with the first planters, which resulted in the 
name of “Salem” as symbolic of peace, one Francis Peabody had 
emigrated from St. Albans, in old England. Later he established 
himself in an outlying region, which is now included in the very at- 
tractive little town to which was given the old-country name of “Tops- 
field.” He “was evidently the first man in the place for capacity and 
influence,” the progenitor of the American Peabodys who have scat- 
tered far and wide. In that family tribe, as in all others, here and  
-P-A-G-E-24
    
22 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
there personalities of conspicuous eminence stand out in prominence 
against the average lives of average men whose deeds for better or 
worse are as the waters of a stream which merge in the ocean. 
The pride of old Salem is her maritime history. During the Revo- 
lution her privateers were many and effective. Less than ten years 
after the Declaration of Independence, a Salem ship, commanded by a 
Salem mariner, first penetrated the uncharted seas of the Orient and 
led the way to unprecedented commercial prosperity. Ship owners 
were the magnates, ship captains were the heroes of that day. Ambi- 
tious youths went into the fo’castle and came out on the quarter deck. 
They formed an aristocracy pickled in salt water, and they and their 
descendants were proud of the pickle. Into their mansions they 
brought treasures of silk and ivory and teakwood, which are still to be 
found in many a Salem home. Among the foremost of the men of this 
sort who responded to the lure of the sea were those of a certain line 
of descent from Col. Francis Peabody. The social standing of their 
families and their descendants is reflected by the local byword of 
“Peabody or nobody,” and the honor of the name to this day is zeal- 
ously maintained in Salem and in our suburb, Boston, by eminent 
men and women who bear it. While the early Salem Peabodys were 
thus making wealth and prestige for their heirs, another Peabody, 
probably of a different line of descent from their common ancestor, 
was quietly living the uneventful life of a mere average man whose 
daily struggle is for necessaries. His decent, humble home was in 
Danvers, some three or four miles from the ships and wharves and 
countinghouses. No doubt he knew of the Salem cousins-more-or-less- 
removed. Whether or not he had acquaintance or contact with them 
cannot now be told. Doubtless he maintained independently the tenor 
of his own simple way, doing the chores, milking the cow, planting the 
garden, getting in the hay, salting down the pig for winter, and not 
forgetting the barrel of cider for the cellar. No doubt he read the 
Bible, the Salem Gazette, and the almanac. No doubt he went to 
church and town meeting. No doubt he had been a patriot, thrilled 
by Sam Adams, admiring Benjamin Franklin, venerating George 
Washington, appreciating the new issues of which Jefferson and Ham- 
ilton were the rival exponents. The man had a good wife and two 
sons, the younger of whom was George. While these sons were mere 
boys their father died, and they had to shift for themselves. 
In recalling the youth of George Peabody, one has to resist an incli- 
~ nation to inject a note of poverty, the opportunity for rhetorical con- 
trast is so inviting. To make this contrast as effective as possible, he 
should have been a barefoot boy, and probably he was. There 
   
-P-A-G-E-25
First Day,—White 23 
should be at least a suggestion of a ragged jacket and a hint of 
hungry yearning for the bun in the bakeshop window. Yet really 
the boy, George Peabody, never suffered from abject poverty. He 
inherited from his parents and their New England stock a sound 
body, a clean mind, a keen conscience, a reverent acknowledgment of 
divine and human law. If these things were his only heritage, he was 
no poorer than thousands of other boys who were his contemporaries. 
And he had some schooling, probably as much as most other boys of 
his time. ; 
The spur of necessity has ever been more productive of success and 
achievement than the golden spoon. 
If you, young gentlemen of the college, asked for a pair of boots, 
your dealer would probably produce laced shoes, a trifle higher than 
the ankle, in distinction from the low-necked affairs which most of 
you are wearing. But the boots with which long ago the little facto- 
ries of New England supplied the country, the ordinary footgear of 
laboring men, were related to modern styles almost as a steel hauberk 
to a silk shirt. The legs, like a section of stovepipe, came up nearly 
to the knees. They were made of cowhide. They looked hard and 
stiff, and suggested instruments of torture. There were stout loops 
of leather sewn on each side at the top of the legs, known as “boot 
straps.” There was a simple formula for putting them on: Insert 
the foot into the aperture of the leg and coax it down the first few 
inches; insert the strongest finger of each hand into the respective 
straps, and pull. Incidentally, there is a well-known point on the 
channel of one of our New England seaports where the outgoing 
tide runs so strong that fishermen rowing home from the sea can 
hardly make headway against it. It has been called from time im- 
memorial, ‘‘Pull-and-be-damned Point.” Something that way with the 
boots. No matter when or where the phrase, “he lifted himself by 
his boot straps,” was coined ; it became at length the all-inclusive defi- 
nition, biography, eulogy, of a self-made man. It describes George 
Peabody. 
In respect to business success, George Peabody differed but in de- 
gree from thousands of other self-made men. The known events of 
his youth are but few: He was “boy” in the country store of his own 
town, a phase of education by no means to be underestimated. In 
mid-teens he was for a year on his grandfather’s farm in Thetford, 
Vt. ) Thence he was back in Massachusetts, at Newburyport, some 
fifteen miles north of his old home, associated with his brother, David, 
in a dry-goods store. Through fire or failure, or both, the bottom 
dropped out of this business, and, somehow, presently the lad found
-P-A-G-E-26
  24 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
himself transplanted from the Merrimac to the Potomac, in those 
days a wondrous transformation from the traditional atmosphere of 
the still Puritan New England to the edge of the “Sunny South.” 
While he was serving in Georgetown, about the year 1812, certain 
tourists from the old country, traveling en masse, accoutered in red 
coats, and carrying muskets, quite personally conducted, visited the 
neighboring capital of Washington, and were not quite as welcome 
as English visitors now are, and, we trust, shall ever be. Later, in 
Baltimore, the young man met real opportunity, grasped it; and made 
the most of it. There he achieved success. There, with prophetic 
vision, he broadened his business activities by foreign transactions. 
From there, by natural transition, he established himself in London, 
where “Success” was spelled in large capitals. 
George Peabody, of London, banker, was the man to whom was 
addressed that invitation to attend the centennial of the incorpora- 
tion of the town of his birth, celebrated in 1852. He was then in the 
mature prime of life, fifty-seven years of age. He had for years 
been known, at least to a limited circle, as a helpful friend and genial 
host to American visitors to England, especially to those who held 
letters of credit on his house. Mr. Peabody could not come to the 
celebration. He sent a letter, he proposed a toast, he made a gift to 
his native town. If a similar gift for a similar purpose should be 
made anywhere in the United States to-morrow, the Associated Press 
would give the event not more than half an inch of newspaper pub- 
licity. We have become saturated with benefactions. Great philan- 
thropical foundations have multiplied. Donations, in huge figures, 
have become commonplace. Some weeks ago, after I had accepted the 
invitation to come to George Peabody College for Teachers to share 
in these proceedings, as I took the Boston Herald from my door- 
step to the breakfast table, my attention was struck by the coin- 
cident announcement, with heavy headlines, in parallel columns, of 
two quite independent stupendous endowments. One was for $15,- 
000,000 by a friend of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
for that and other institutions; the other was for $40,000,000 by a 
native of North Carolina, for the establishment of a great university 
in a city of that state and for other charities. Sixty-five millions! 
A sum incomprehensible, fabulous, to us ordinary mortals! Yet I 
had a suspicion that even these extraordinary announcements would 
pass without much comment. I determined to note carefully all that 
I might hear concerning them while the news was still hot. At a 
meeting of bank directors early that morning, not a word. On the 
train from Salem to Boston, in company with friends who are keen on

current events, not a word. In the courthouse at Cambridge, within 
a mile of Harvard, within actual sight of the Technology buildings, 
from associate judges, from registers, from court officers, from at- 
tendant lawyers, plenty of talk about other things, including cross- 
word puzzles, but not a word about the great gifts. Only at the end 
of the day, as my return train was approaching home, did the remark 
of a Dartmouth graduate break the otherwise monotonous silence 
concerning them. 
The ever-recurring generations of men accept the environment into 
which they are born as a matter of established fact and take little 
thought of its origin. 
Speaking of the region in which Mr. Peabody was born, not only 
the children of to-day, but their fathers and mothers, regard the free 
public library as no less inseparable from community life than the 
church, the schoolhouse, the locomotive, the automobile. 
Who of us who send and receive telegrams as casually as we send 
and receive letters give a thought to the marvel of that first message 
which Morse succeeded in flashing over his wire? Who of us who 
have been relieved by painless surgery look back to the unthinkable 
misery of an amputation before the discovery of ether? 
It is to the pioneers of every philanthropy that the grateful homage 
of humanity is perpetually due. The justification, the glory of an 
occasion like this is that it rends the curtain of indifference and for- 
getfulness and re-reveals the personality of some leader who blazed 
an untrod way toward the amelioration of his fellow men. 
Referring again to the year 1852, there was then nothing novel 
in the idea of a library. It was older than Alexandria. Oxford, 
Cambridge, and the continental universities had great collections of 
printed books, but these were open only to scholars and students. 
It happens that something like a free library had then just been in- 
itiated in Liverpool. By coincidence, at about the same time, in the 
old whaling port of New Bedford, in Boston, and in the little town of 
Wayland, near Lexington and Concord, there were similar percepti- 
ble initiatives. It is utterly improbable that Mr. Peabody had any 
knowledge of these slight movements in Massachusetts. There is no 
evidence that he took any cue from England. His letter to his native 
town was dated months before the opening of the Manchester library, 
in which Thackeray and Dickens and Bulwer and John Bright took 
part. In that letter he specifically states: “The subject of making 
a gift to my native town has for some years occupied my mind.” 
The toast upon the sealed envelope of Mr. Peabody’s letter was 
that which you have preserved inscribed on your college seal: “Edu-  
-P-A-G-E-28
  26 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
eation, a debt due from present to future generations.” The break- 
ing of that seal was quite unlike the opening of Pandora’s box. She, 
poor girl, unloosed the woes of the world. He, noble man, having 
himself conceived an idea of limitless beneficent possibility, then for 
the first time disclosed it to his fellow men. 
The example set by Mr. Peabody began to be followed almost imme- 
diately. Speaking of his home state, you may now drive through it 
lengthwise, widthwise, and crosswise, and in every city and town you 
will find a public library. A large percentage of them are estab- 
lished as memorial gifts. These memorials range from munificent 
elegance to modest simplicity. Each embodies and perpetuates some 
tender sentiment of association between certain individuals and cer- 
tain particular spots on God’s footstool which to them have been par- 
ticularly dear. Here and there libraries which were established by 
living donors have automatically become memorials. Of such a sort 
are Mr. Peabody’s own institutes; for, in addition to those in the 
present city of Peabody, in the present town of Danvers, and in Bal- 
timore, he established a library as a memorial to his mother in the 
town of her birth, another in that Vermont village which was the 
ultima Thule of his boyhood ventures, and he enriched the library 
of Newburyport by reason of his youthful experience there. Of the 
same sort, for example, in the little hill town of Cummington, the 
birthplace of William Cullen Bryant, is the unpretentious structure 
of native pasture-land rock, a gift from the poet, which has become 
one of America’s literary shrines. 
In many instances, donors, not seeing with mortal eyes the fruition 
of their purpose, have provided by will for its execution. For ex- 
ample, a gentleman who in the small town of Oxford began a career 
which reached distinction in a neighboring large city, made a legacy 
“toward establishing a free public library in that town as an inade- 
quate return for the kindness and patronage of their fathers in my 
early professional life.” Some few miles beyond Concord, on that 
same great highway which the midnight ride of Paul Revere has 
made famous, is the town of Littleton. Some forty years ago a gen- 
tleman in Boston, who modestly withheld his name, gave to that town 
a considerable sum of money for a public library in honor of a cer- 
tain citizen, who, in the boyhood of the donor, had rendered valuable 
assistance to his father at a time of financial embarrassment. 
In other instances children have in this manner perpetuated the 
memory of their parents. 
Some of our hill towns on the western border are beloved by sum- 
mer residents. Blandford, of but few hundred population, has one of 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
First Day,—White 27 
those modest, but thoroughly artistic, library buildings, all its own. 
It is the gift of a lady to perpetuate the memory of a son “who had 
spoken feelingly of the absence of any place in the town where the 
young could obtain good reading.” 
On the southern side of the estuary which makes in from Buzzards 
Bay sits New Bedford. The last of its whalers, wrecked by a fearful 
storm at the very outset of her voyage, is now being knocked to pieces 
on the rocks of Cuttyhunk. Against the cherished background of its 
ancient industry the city’s ten thousand cotton looms are trying to 
drown by the hum of still prosperous activity the dread of the new and 
ominous competition of your mills here in the South. On the opposite 
side of the estuary, now connected with the big city by a long bridge, 
is a town which, a century ago, must have been the ideal of quiet re- 
pose. Here were some of the homes of the men who turned whale oil 
into money. And here was born a man who in later years turned 
another kind of oil into much more money. He came to be known as 
one of the magnates of that huge corporation which, having to do 
with petroleum and its products, is very well known indeed. This 
man, since deceased, gave lavishly to his birthplace—a sumptuous 
church, an elegant town hall, a superb school, a stately public library. 
You will remember the talk about “tainted money” with reference to 
certain gifts for religious and educational purposes made by other 
individuals whose wealth came from this same petroleum source. 
But if heretofore the very munificence of the aggregations of memo- 
rials in the town just referred to has failed to invoke the degree of 
responsive sentiment aroused by any such single and modest struc- 
ture as I have instanced, whenever I may hereafter pass or enter 
the public library of that town, I shall do so with a new and merited 
reverence. One who tries to prepare for an occasion like this present 
commemoration learns something. The edifice and its contents are 
known as the “Millicent Library,” a girl’s name. Why? In its dedi- 
cation, the donor, speaking for himself and his wife, said this: “The 
germ of the Millicent Library had its origin in the darkness of a great 
grief, and pressed its tendrils into our hearts through a little story 
that was told us of the dear girl whose memory we adore and desire to 
perpetuate. The story was expressive of what was in her heart a 
few weeks before her death; and, coupled with the love she had for 
books, there came to our children a common desire to erect a library 
in tribute to her memory. The suggestion was so pleasing to us as 
parents that it found 4 ready acceptance, and, with a feeling of thank- 
fulness to Heaven for the blessings which would enable us to carry 
out the work, we undertook the task.”  
-P-A-G-E-30
  
  28 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
Thus within George Peabody’s native state has the idea of the free 
public library developed, and far and wide beyond its bounds that 
idea has taken root and is ever spreading. The almost limitless col- 
lections of our metropolitan libraries are but the highest expression 
of the idea. 
Books, books, books! One with an aspiration for liberal education 
enters one of these greatest institutions, as a worshiper of old entered 
his temple, with humility and awe and reverence. He is conscious of 
the unseen presence of all the men and all the women who have con- 
tributed to the knowledge of the world. On its miles of shelves are 
the thoughts of all philosophy, the records of all history, the life sto- 
ries of all biographies, the soul of all poetry, the beauty of all art, the 
accomplishments of all science, the dreams of all romance. 
As the smaller libraries are Everyman’s school and college, the 
great library is Everyman’s university. Small and large, here, there, 
all over our country, they are the culmination of that idea promul- 
gated by George Peabody in the town of his birth seventy-three years 
ago. Is not this far-reaching feature of his philanthropy worthy of 
a share in your general commemoration? 
I am scrupulous to avoid encroachment on topics specifically assigned 
to others. I apprehend that your honored guest who is to speak of the 
gift for the poor of London, and your own distinguished educator who 
is to speak of the gift in which you are most keenly interested, will both 
have been impressed by the exceedingly high character and standing of 
the gentlemen, in England and here, with whom Mr. Peabody sur- 
rounded himself and to whom he intrusted the execution of his designs. 
May I refer briefly to a personal touch with the donor’s most intimate 
friend and adviser, a man who, as long as he lived, was the head of the 
trustees of the Peabody Education Fund, whose wisdom was ever the 
guiding factor of their deliberations? Orator, scholar, gentleman, 
descendant of the great colonial governor, he stood for all that Boston 
stood for in its golden age of literary and social supremacy. It hap- 
pened that the first Peabody Institute erected in the present town of 
Danvers was burned. At the formal opening of the building which 
replaces it I was asked to make the dedicatory address. From the 
stenographer’s draft I quote this paragraph: : 
“It was my privilege yesterday afternoon, on one of the most beau- 
tiful estates in that beautiful suburb of Boston, Brookline, to be al- 
lowed to see and to take the hand of the Hon. Robert C. Winthrop, 
the man who, now in his eighty-third year, was the right hand of Mr. 
Peabody in the administration of this great Southern fund. And 
underneath the portrait of Benjamin Franklin, on the wall of his noble

hall, I heard him, sitting in the same chair in which Mr. Peabody 
sat, tell simply the story of how Mr. Peabody unfolded from his 
own consciousness the deliberated plan of that wonderful endowment 
of the Peabody Fund.” 
Doubtless President Brister will recall to you in a word picture of 
the first meeting of the trustees in an upper room of Willard’s Hotel, 
in Washington, how, during prayer, on the one side of the “good 
bishop,” Mr. Peabody humbly knelt; on the other, a man in undress 
uniform, with the simple stars of his insignia—General Grant. 
In the autumn of 1869, during the last visit of Mr. Peabody to this 
country, a reception in the rooms of that Institute which he had first 
founded was attended by another gathering of most distinguished 
men. ‘Thinking of this day and of this assembly, I held and exam- 
ined, as it were, with your eyes, the carefully prepared volume in 
which are preserved the letters and portraits of those who had been 
invited. Accompanying the photograph of a gentleman whose schol- 
arly face had a dignity all its own, I came across this letter:

25 Sept 1869 
Dear Sir: 
In compliance with your request I send a photograph of myself, the last that 
has been taken, and shall feel honored in its being placed among the “Friends” of 
Mr. Peabody, for though they may be numbered by millions, yet all can appreciate 
the man who has illustrated his age by his munificent charities during his life, 
and by his wise provisions for promoting the happiness of his fellow-creatures. 
Very respt your Obt Servt

Mr. Peabody returned to London in broken health from this last 
visit to America. There, a few months later, he died: 
’Way back in my youth, during inadequate preparation for college, 
in a first meeting with something harder than the Anabasis, I think 
it was Herodotus, I was shocked to find that I must translate a 
passage concerning some soldier or statesman: “He went to sleep 
with his mother.” The editor’s note explained it as figurative, mean- 
ing that he was buried in his mother earth. The impression of that 
first shock and the recurrent conception of the pathos and beauty un- 
derlying the symbolism has ever since remained. Among the last 
words of the good and great man were: “Danvers, don’t forget Dan- 
vers.” He was brought home to sleep with his mother. 
And the manner of his home-coming! Such honor as England only

bestows on her own most illustrious dead she bestowed on this unti- 
tled American. The supreme glory of Westminster was accorded him. 
By mandate of the Queen, a majestic ship of the royal navy became 
his funeral car across the Atlantic. In dramatic contrast to the 
simplicity of his private life, with the funeral obsequies of a hero and 
conqueror, midst the booming of minute guns, he went to his eternal 
rest, at home. 
Alumni of the College, members of its student body, you may have 
wondered at the effrontery of an unknown Massachusetts Yankee in 
addressing you. Alleging a representative capacity, I might possibly 
get by an indulgent committee on credentials. But I somewhat 
proudly assert a vested right to join with you in a common sodality. 
Among the home charities of Mr. Peabody was the establishment 
of a fund for the provision of medals to graduates of the local high 
school. The exercises of graduation day, the day of all days, took 
place on the platform of the Lyceum Hall of the Peabody Institute, be- 
neath the great oil portrait of its founder. The culmination of the 
exercises was the presentation of the medals. 
You will recall that in days of old, when knighthood was in flower, 
kings were better fighters than writers, and that their favorite cre- 
dential was their signet ring. I display to you the signet of George 
Peabody. On its face is his medallion portrait, surrounded by the 
words: “Education, a debt due from present to future generations.” 
On the back my own name and a date are engraved. I respectfully 
decline to read the date. The face of the medal is identical with 
your seal. Havel qualified? Am I not of the brotherhood? 
Ambassador! The sonorous syllables of that word bespeak the 
dignity of its meaning—the messenger of a king, the messenger of a 
people, the ministering herald of an uplifting idea. “And now are ye 
ambassadors,” alumni and students, to carry abroad from the stra- 
tegic center of your Alma Mater that gospel of education epitomized 
in the motto of its Founder.

GEORGE PEABODY, HIS LIFE AND WORK 
IN AMERICA 
  
P. P. CLAXTON 
Superintendent of Schools, Tulsa, Okla. 
  
Recently a cartoon appeared in an Oklahoma newspaper containing 
a conversation between two men who had met on a country road in 
Hardin County, Ky., in the winter of 1809, just preceding the inaugu- 
ration of President Madison. 
“No news about here, except that there’s a new baby down to Tom 
Lincoln’s.” 
But the most important event in the world that day and month 
and year was the birth of the new baby “down to Tom Lincoln’s.” 
So difficult is it to know at the time just what events are important 
and what are not—to know just what is news. 
A resident of the South Parish of Danvers, Mass., might have an- 
swered an inquiring visitor similarly on February 18, 1795—just 
one hundred and thirty years ago this day. Again the birth of a 
boy in a humble home was among the great events of the day, month, 
and year. / We are met here to do honor to the boy and the man; 
to rejoicé-in the results of a portion of his work; to recount some- 
what of the wide sweep of its influence; and to catch the vision, if 
we may, of the long succession of future harvests, growing richer as 
the years come and go. 
It is the old story, so often retold in America, where weakness in 
freedom grows stronger than strength with a chain/ Born of “poor 
but respectable parents,” little schooling, leaving the poor country 
or village school at a tender age to go to work, thirst for knowledge, 
and the final triumph of keen intellect, good moral character, self- 
respect, high purpose, and unremitting industry. | 
George Peabody had only four or five years in the village school. 
At eleven he was apprenticed ‘“‘shopboy” in a grocer’s store. At six- 
teen he became a clerk in his brother’s dry-goods store. In his eight- 
eenth year he was associated with his uncle in business. At nineteen 
he formed a partnership with Elisha Riggs, in the District of Colum- 
bia, which started him on the road to fortune. In 1815, when Peabody 
was twenty, the firm of Riggs & Peabody, later changed to Peabody, 
Riggs & Co., moved to Baltimore. Here his sterling character and 
his cordial manner won for him not only success, but also “the kind- 
ness, hospitality, and confidence” of the people of Baltimore and of  
-P-A-G-E-34
  82 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
the state of Maryland, the memory of which led him to render most 
valuable service to the state in the days of her financial distress in 
1837, and which had not been forgotten when, in 1857 and the follow- _ 
ing years, he made large gifts for the establishment of the Peabody 
Institute in Baltimore. : . 
As early as 1827 Peabody’s business began to take him on frequent 
visits to England. Ten years later he established himself perma- 
nently in London. . But till his death in 1869 he never ceased to be a 
typical patriotic American. | _ 
The school which George Peabody attended for a few months in 
early childhood was small and weak, and was probably thought of as 
insignificant. But is any school which an ambitious American boy 
attends insignificant? For Peabody the brief attendance on this 
school made all else possible. For the value of the New England 
common school, however small and poor, he always had the highest 
appreciation. The New England common school, planted liberally 
among the immigrants, who in the first half of the nineteenth century 
were rapidly filling up the middle West and beginning to overflow 
into the farther West, was his hope for that section of the country, 
as it was later his hope for the people of both races in the Southern 
states after the devastation and disruption of war. Except for 
his large gift for the housing of the poor in London, practically all his 
gifts of importance were for education. Thus he wisely sought “not 
to relieve poverty, but to prevent it.” The sentiment accompanying 
the first of his gifts to his native town is at last about to obtain uni- 
versal recognition: “Education, a debt due from present to future 
generations.” It is the most important of all debts. If the present 
generation default in the payment of this debt, it thereby defaults in 
all. There is little else it can do. 
In the true spirit of the American business man, Peabody contin- 
ued his work long after his accumulated wealth had gone far beyond 
his early expectations—continued it for the very joy in the work itself 
and for the sake of the great purposes to which he had planned to 
devote his fortune. Rejoicing in his work and cheered on by the 
vision of the results of his gifts for the relief and help of humanity, 
he continued in it to the end. Vision of results! Like all construc- 
tive, successful men, he had the power of the seer—the power to see 
and to realize. In the letter accompanying his first gift for education 
in the South he breaks forth almost into rhapsody: “I see our country 
united and prosperous, emerging from the clouds which still surround 
her, taking a higher rank among the nations of the world, and becom- 
ing richer and more powerful than ever before.” This was his vision

in February, 1867, when lesser and more purely practical men could 
see only the abomination of desolation by which they were sur- 
rounded! 
It was his belief in these purposes and the consciousness of never 
having “deceived or harmed a human being” that gave him such con- 
stant and indomitable courage as enabled him to defy the bankers and 
the money brokers of London and dare them to cause his failure, when, 
in the panic of 1858, they refused him a necessary loan of a million 
pounds sterling, except on such conditions as he could not and would 
not accept—to dare, defy, and finally to win. Like so many other suc- 
cessful business men, sometimes thought to be immersed in and inter- 
ested only in money getting, his real business was benevolence, all else 
only the means therefor. To Mr. Winthrop he once said: “From the 
earliest years of my manhood I have contemplated some such disposi- 
tion of my property, and I have prayed my Heavenly Father day by 
day that I might be enabled before I die to show my gratitude for the 
blessings he has bestowed upon me, by doing some great good to my 
fellow men.” 
Charles Page, multimillionaire of Sand Springs, Okla., who is de- 
voting a large part of his wealth to constructive help of widows and 
orphans, says he is in partnership with The Big Fellow. I wonder if 
many other such, including George Peabody, have not felt and do not 
fee] that God is an important member of their firm. 
Of all his benefactions, the one nearest Peabody’s heart and by far 
the most far-reaching and the most fruitful was the one a small part of 
the results of which we see about us here to-day—his gifts for popular 
education in the war-stricken South. f{n the letter accompanying his 
first gift for this cause and constituting the board of trust to admin- 
ister the fund, after uttering the vision referred to above, he pro- 
ceeds: “But to make her prosperity more than superficial, her moral 
and intellectual development should keep pace with her material 
growth; and in those portions of our nation to which I have referred 
[the Southern states], the urgent and pressing physical need of our 
almost impoverished people must for some years preclude them from 
making by unaided effort such advances in education and such prog- 
ress in the diffusion of knowledge among all classes as every lover of 
his country must earnestly desire.” 
His sane common sense enabled him to understand, as most men of 
his time did not understand, both the character of education needed 
and the fact that to be effective it must be for all the people—high 
and low, white and black alike. He, therefore, directed his trustees to 
apply the income of the trust and finally the principal when, after
-P-A-G-E-38
    
34 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
thirty years, they might think it wise to dissolve the trust, “to the 
promotion and encouragement of intellectual, moral, and industrial 
education among the young of the more destitute portions of the 
Southern and the Southwestern states of our Union, my purpose being 
that the benefits intended shall be distributed among the entire popu- 
lation without other distinction than their needs and the opportuni- 
ties of usefulness to them.” His chief desire was to aid in giving ele- 
mentary education to the children of the common people—the very 
thing most likely to be overlooked at that time among the people of these 
states. He understood also more fully than most men of his day could 
understand the interdependence of the different sections of the coun- 
try, and how the welfare of each section was bound up in the prosper- 
ity of all. In making his second gift two years later, in 1869, he said 
with emotion in his voice: ‘This I give to the suffering South for the 
good of the whole country.” 
With a wisdom not always shown by those who have had both the 
ability and the will to help some portion of mankind by the gift of 
large sums of money, ‘he left his trustees free as to the details. 
He chose men of wisdom whom he could trust, then trusted them 
without reserve. The wisdom of this action, as well as the fine 
understanding of the characters of the trustees chosen by him, 
is well shown by the fact that, though the funds finally avail- 
able were small in comparison with many gifts for education 
made since and with funds raised by taxation for the support of 
schools, no other gift for education has been so far-reaching in its 
constructive influence. During the first thirty years of the existence 
of the trust only two states, Virginia and Tennessee, received as much 
as $200,000. The total of $216,000 received by Tennessee during all 
these years is approximately one per cent of what is now spent for 
public education in this state in a single year. The total of less than 
two and a half million dollars disbursed for all purposes during these 
three decades is little, if any, more than one per cent of the present 
total annual expenditure in the Southern and Southwestern states for 
public elementary and high schools. The total disbursements of in- 
come and of the principal itself is much less than five per cent of 
what these states are spending for public education this year. Any 
one of them will now, with little thought or care, add to or take from 
its annual appropriations for education as much as the total amount 
received from the Peabody Education Fund from beginning to end. 
Of the total capital investment and income of no one of the institu- 
tions sharing in the final distribution of the principal of the fund do 
the moneys thus derived constitute more than a minor part. Yet no
-P-A-G-E-39
First Day,—Claxton 35 
one can calculate what part of these larger incomes now available are 
thus available because of the wise administration of this small fund. 
This constitutes its chief glory. 
The first board brought together in counsel and action were repre- 
sentative men from both sides of the great struggle then just ended, 
men of leadership and possessed of the full confidence of their fellow 
citizens on both sides; and those chosen later were of the same char- 
acter and influence. 
The mere announcement of the names of the first board immediately 
disarmed all suspicion and gained the confidence of thoughtful people, 
both North and South, that the purposes of the trust were worthy and 
that the methods of administration would be wise and just. The an- 
nual meetings of these great men for this high purpose were a power- 
ful influence toward reuniting the people whom they represented. Dr. 
J. L. M. Curry, later general agent of the fund and historian of the 
Confederacy, says the fund came ‘‘a white-winged messenger of peace 
and fraternity in the hour of gloom, poverty, and despondency.” 
“No instrumentality,” he adds, “has been so effective in the South in 
promoting concord, in restoring fellowship, in cultivating a broad 
and generous patriotism; and, apart from its direct connection with 
schools, it has been an unsurpassed blessing in cementing the bond of 
a lately dissevered Union.” 
The general agents of the board were such as such a board might 
have been expected to select: Barnas Sears, J. L. M. Curry, Samuel A. 
Green, Wickliffe Rose. To their wisdom and energy, constantly coun- 
seled by the chairman, Robert C. Winthrop, as long as he lived, are 
due the wonderful constructive results of the fund, no less than to the 
trustees themselves. 
Sears and, to a larger degree, Curry were flaming evangels, preach- 
ing everywhere eloquently, earnestly, and effectively the gospel of pub- 
lic education—the education of all the children of all the people in 
schools supported by taxes levied on the property of all the people; 
convincing and moving the people and their representatives in city 
councils, county courts, and state legislatures; and, probably more 
important still, firing the zeal of younger men like Galloway of Mis- 
sissippi, Aswell of Louisiana, Bowie and Abercrombie of Alabama, 
Alderman, McIver, and Aycock of North Carolina, Tate of South Car- 
olina, and a host of others in all these states, to carry the gospel of 
public education to every nook and corner of the country and to work 
as few men have ever had opportunity to work for the great cause 
fundamental to the welfare of the whole people. 
The story of the work of the Peabody Education Fund cannot be fully
-P-A-G-E-40
  36 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
told without telling the story of these men. It is no reflection on other 
general agents of the fund or on other workers for the cause of public 
education in these states to dwell here on the preéminent services of Dr. 
Curry. With tongue and pen, in formal address, in informal conversa- 
tion, and by personal influence in every state, he preached, in season 
and out of season, this great crusade. There is record of his addressing 
fifty legislatures, less one, and always on the same theme and in the same 
masterful way—four in Alabama, seven in Georgia, three in Florida, 
six in South Carolina, four in North Carolina, two in Virginia, one in 
West Virginia, four in Tennessee, one in Kentucky, five in Arkansas, 
five in Mississippi, three in Louisiana, four in Texas. And he ap- 
peared more than once, I believe, before committees of Congress in 
behalf of the Blair Bill, which sought to give Federal aid for education 
in the states. But it was through his hundreds of addresses before 
teachers’ institutes, education associations, and popular assemblies 
that he sowed most effectively the seeds that are still springing up to 
abundant harvests. It was there that these scores and hundreds of 
young men heard and were inspired by him, who have for forty years 
continued to spread his gospel and to ring the changes on his very 
phrases. I have heard these phrases in original or adapted form in 
every Southern state, and must myself plead guilty to this high type 
of plagiarism. 
He preached the duty of the state in the support of education. To 
the legislature of Louisiana in 1880 he said: “With state aid, univer- 
sal education is difficult and slow; without it, unattainable, impossi- 
ble.” To the Georgia legislature in 1888: “The duty of parents and 
churches must not be underestimated, but the whole history of the 
human race shows their insufficiency—without state systems and 
support, general education is impossible. Parental and individ- 
ual and church efforts have never approximated the needs of the 
young.” To the legislature of Louisiana in 1892: “Private schools 
perish; the state does not die.”* To the Virginia legislature in 
1892: “Every human being has an absolute, indefeasible right 
to education, and there is the correlative duty of government to 
see that the means of education are provided for all. The first 
necessity of civilization is a system of universal education. Edu- 
cation is the only security for our free institutions; an essential con- 
dition of personal and civil liberty, of equality before the law. 
  
*T have heard President Alderman repeat this, as if original with him, to mass 
meetings of citizens in the mountains of Western North Carolina and elsewhere, 
and with tone and manner that Curry might have envied. Happy the man whose 
carefully-thought-out and wrought-out phrases become original with a large 
group of earnest, eloquent followers.
-P-A-G-E-41
First Day,—Claxton 37 
What we permit our neighbors to be, that we set up as the arbiter of 
our political well-being. The ignorance of one voter is an abridg- 
ment of the liberty of others. His ballot determines more or less our 
government. Public education is one of the functions of government 
and goes along with the right to exist. The life or death of the state 
means the intelligence or ignorance of the citizen. . . . The first 
duty of government is self-preservation, and the noblest function of 
statehood is to develop and raise to the maximum degree the brain 
power of the country. In the use or nonuse of this intellectual 
power lies the difference betwixt nations. The proportion of well- 
taught children to the population is the measure of the civilization of 
that people. . . . Education should be given to all; and to let a 
child grow up in ignorance is treason to the state, to humanity, and to 
God.” 
Curry understood and constantly demonstrated the relation between 
education and material wealth, and again in this has he been followed 
by his disciples. Only two weeks ago one of them addressed the legis- 
lature of the state of Arkansas in the very spirit and largely in the 
words of Curry. Such preaching was more needed forty and twenty- 
five years ago than now. Hear Curry as he speaks to the legislature 
of Louisiana in 1890: “No kind of outlay is so remunerative as that 
made by a state for education.” And to the legislature of Virginia in 
1892: “But taxation for education can never prove a burden to a peo- 
ple or impoverish them. Education makes wealth.” 
When the people or their representatives in tax-levying bodies told 
Curry that they were too poor to support their schools, he replied: 
“We are too poor not to educate. Only through education shall we 
ever be able to develop our resources and become rich. Among the 
most substantial and quickening agencies of national prosperity is the 
schoolhouse.” To the legislature of Alabama in 1885 he said: “Edu- 
cation is the fundamental basis of general and permanent prosperity. 
Poverty is the inevitable result of ignorance. Capital follows the 
schoolhouse.” To the legislature of North Carolina in 1891: “Edu- 
cation is the basis, the grand condition, of wealth. No ignorant peo- 
ple were ever prosperous. . . . A school tax is convertible into 
dollars and cents, houses and lands; and the wise legislator evokes this 
element of power and progress and prosperity. . . . To leave 
labor in ignorance and thriftlessness is blind folly, is bad economy, 
is stupidity.” Before the Virginia legislature in 1892 he quoted 
with approval Emerson’s saying about Massachusetts: “We have nei- 
ther fertile lands nor water power, neither mines nor forests; but we 
   
-P-A-G-E-42
  38 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
have children, and through them we can take hold on the great world, 
if we send them forth as we can make them in our schools.” 
In like manner he emphasized the relation of universal education to 
the civic and social and moral good, to the best types of religion; the 
need of an organic system of schools from the lowest to the highest, 
the need of trained teachers and normal schools in which to train them. 
The motto of the state, he said, should be: “Good teachers or none; 
good schools or none.” He advocated constantly manual and voca- 
tional education. He rejoiced in his opportunity to help establish 
right policies of education for the negroes: “Everywhere I have ad- 
vocated the upbuilding of the lately emancipated and unfranchised 
negro, and upon no part of my work do I look back with greater 
personal satisfaction. . . . If the negroes remain as occupants 
of the land and co-citizens of the states, they will drag us down to in- 
dustrial bankruptcy, social degradation, and political corruption, un- 
less we lift them up. Ignorance is no remedy for the situation, prom- 
ises no relief, and only aggravates the evil.” 
I seem to see and hear him now as he stood and spoke, eyes flash- 
ing and voice vibrant as if inspired, at the first meeting of the 
conference for education in the South, at Winston-Salem, N.C. He 
spoke like a prophet entranced by the vision of the things to be, 
and which were made possible in the Southern states by the work of 
that conference. It was the last time I saw or heard him. The mem- 
ory of it is imperishable. 
How out of date and like an echo of the past are the quotations I 
have just read! But there are men and women still in middle life who 
remember when there was need of saying and reiterating such things 
with force and zeal and constantly. That it is no longer necessary to 
ery these things aloud is due largely to the Peabody Education Fund, 
its agents, and to those who cried aloud throughout the wilder- 
ness in which we wandered for forty years after the war. That the 
days of our poverty have passed so fully is also due to this preaching 
and to other uses of the Peabody Education Fund. The few millions 
spent by the trustees have thus been transmuted into more billions 
of material wealth. 
Had the fund done nothing more than to make possible this great 
work of educational evangelization by Curry and those inspired by 
him, it still would have been one of the greatest influences for good in 
the life of our country. 
But it has done much more; and this much more has been due largely 
to the organizing ability of its first general agent, Barnas Sears, and 
his wise constructive work, which made it possible for Curry to devote
-P-A-G-E-43
  
First Day,—Claxton 39 
so much time to preaching, and later to the great vision of Wickliffe 
Rose, who conceived and wrought for Peabody College in this en- 
larged form and on this new site. It was Sears who outlined for the 
board the policies that were followed, in principle at least, with only 
such changes as changing conditions demanded and made possible, 
till the time of the dissolving of the trust and the distribution of the 
principal of the fund. This policy had as its goal a well-supported 
system of public schools, maintained by the good will of the people 
and by sufficient funds raised by state or local taxes, taught by com- 
petent teachers trained in state-supported normal schools, and having 
courses of study adapted to the needs of the children. The board wisely 
resisted the demands and temptations, numerous enough, to dole out 
moneys as charities or as subsidies to weak schools. 
Pursuing this policy, small amounts of money were given to cities 
and towns that would support by any means, preferably by local tax- 
ation, free public schools. The sums given seem now pitifully small— 
at first, $300 for 100 pupils, $450 for 150 pupils, $600 for 200 pupils; 
in a few instances, $4,000 for 2,000 or more pupils. Later the max- 
imum was limited to $2,000. These maximum amounts were given 
to any one place for only a year or two, and then gradually diminished 
to the vanishing point. Having been assisted in shouldering them, 
cities were left and encouraged to carry their own burdens. Small 
amounts were these, but I believe a large majority of the city and town 
public-school systems established in these states before 1895 had some 
such help, and that most of them were established several years ear- 
lier than they would have been without it. It constituted a most 
effective form of bribery to duty and virtue. 
It seems a far cry from Tennessee’s $50,000, plus poll taxes, and 
North Carolina’s $42,862 for teachers’ salaries, in 1870, to the mil- 
lions these two states now spend annually for public schools. That 
was only fifty-five years ago, and some of us were then in the public 
schools two or three months a year, taught by teachers who were re- 
ceiving less than $100 a term for their services. 
But schools could not be made effective without teachers, and there 
were not enough trained teachers to go around. There were no nor- 
mal schools in which to train them in any large numbers. So the 
Peabody Education Fund gave money for summer institutes, schools 
for teachers at state universities and elsewhere, later for teachers’ 
institutes in each congressional district from one to six weeks each 
year or each alternate year. The purpose of these institutes was to 
teach methods, especially for the primary schools, and to preach to 
teachers and people the gospel of public education. Still later, in  
-P-A-G-E-44

many of the states, county institutes were partly supported by the 
fund. It was at one of these institutes in North Carolina that I first 
met Bruce Payne. The early state normal schools, led by Peabody 
College, were helpful in much the same way: Sam Houston Normal, 
in Texas, in 1879; Farmville, Va., in 1884; Columbus, Miss., in 1884; 
Greensboro, N. C., in 1891; and Winthrop, S. C., in 1891 also. All 
these, and others, including many normal schools for negroes, had 
some help from the fund till they were well established and till the 
value of normal schools to the public-school system had been effectively 
demonstrated. The many normal schools now serving these states 
more or less effectively, as they are supported generously or nig- 
gardly, some of them niggardly enough, owe their existence directly 
or indirectly to the Peabody Education Fund. Here, as in the case 
of the common schools, a little money wisely used has resulted in 
large appropriations of state funds and enabled those connected with 
the fund to direct wisely the policies of the schools in their formative 
period. 
’ By far the most helpful and influential of this group of schools 
has been Peabody College, established in 1875 through the codper- 
ation of the Peabody Board, the trustees of the University of Nash- 
ville, and the Legislature of the State of Tennessee, urged on by Gov- 
ernor James D. Porter. Meager enough was the help of the state 
throughout all the years of its connection with it, but it was enough 
to keep alive the interest of the state in its work. 
The good fortune of Peabody College in having as its first two presi- 
dents such men as Eben S. Stearns and William H. Payne, and the wis- 
dom of the board in providing scholarships for picked young men and 
women, gave it influence in that early day far greater in extent and 
character than it could otherwise have had. The average amount paid 
annually for scholarships for the first twenty years, from 1877 to 1897, 
was less than $20,000. The total amount in all these years was as much 
as $40,000 for only three states—Georgia, Tennessee, and Virginia. 
These scholarship students and others carried new ideals, new meth- 
ods, new life, into the schools in which they afterwards taught.| I 
was taught for a year by one of the first of these scholarship students. 
My youthful impression of him was that he had better methods and 
more pleasant manners in the schoolroom, and dressed better than 
any teacher I had ever known. 
One is tempted to make a roll call of the most notable of these 
graduates of the old days who now hold or have held prominent posi- 
tions and done valuable service, as city or county or state superintend-
-P-A-G-E-45
  
First Day,—Claxton 41 
ents, as presidents or teachers in normal schools, as professors in 
colleges, as principals in high schools, as supervisors of special sub- 
jects, as model teachers in elementary schools, or as educational states- 
men. The list is a long one and is now being lengthened and strength- 
ened from year to year by those who come to this College and return to 
the service of education in these states. Their influence has been and 
is felt in all the states, and much of the best that we now have has been 
obtained through their enthusiasm, energy, and fine technique. Again 
a little candle, little in material cost, has thrown its beams afar. 
When the time came for distributing the principal of the Peabody 
Education Fund and closing the trust, the Southern state universities 
were at the peak of interest in establishing departments or schools of 
education, particularly for the preparation of principals and teachers 
of the high schools, just then being organized everywhere under the 
inspiration and guidance of professors of secondary education and in- 
spectors of high schools. To most of these universities the fund ren- 
dered most effective help by giving to each of them a small amount 
(usually $40,000) for an education building on condition that the uni- 
versity would make liberal provision for the support of a department 
or school of education. Already good results, which might otherwise 
have been longer delayed, are coming from this wise policy. 
* In summing up the influence of Peabody and the fund, it must not 
be forgotten that the timely establishment of this fund and its wise 
management have stimulated other large gifts for similar purposes. 
When, in 1882, John F. Slater gave a million dollars in trust for the 
purpose of making the negroes of the Southern states “good men and 
good citizens,” he was encouraged thereto by the eminent wisdom and 
success that had marked the conduct of the Peabody Education Fund. 
There is good reason to believe that Johns Hopkins was moved by a 
conversation with George Peabody to give his fortune for the estab- 
lishment of Johns Hopkins University and Hospital. Paul Tulane’s 
plans for the giving and direction of moneys for education in New 
Orleans, from which came Tulane University, were inspired and _in-, 
fluenced by Peabody’s gift and the plans for its administration. 
Would that John McDonogh might have been as wisely guided in mak- 
ing and providing for the administration of his magnificent gift! 
Dr. Curry believed that Anthony Drexel, a member of the Peabody 
Board, was much influenced by the Peabody Education Fund and its 
administration in his noble endowment of the Drexel Institute of Art, 
Science, and Industry, in Philadelphia. 
Who knows how much this act of George Peabody’s and the wise  
-P-A-G-E-46
  42 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
management of the fund have influenced John D. Rockefeller in mak- 
ing his large gifts to education, particularly those made through the 
General Education Board? The Southern Education Board, and later 
the General Education Board, grew out of the committee appointed 
by the conference for education in the South at Winston-Salem, at 
which Curry made the prophetic speech to which I have already re- 
ferred. I believe this committee was appointed on the day on which 
the speech was made. 
Among America’s most valuable possessions is the example of 
George Peabody. 
Had I time, it would be pleasing to try to follow Curry in his 
Winston-Salem speech and to prophesy of the far-reaching influences 
in the next half century of this college for teachers, the one most 
prominent visible result of Peabody’s gift. Most of you can and will 
do it more effectively for yourselves. 
(The best gift to any country is a great man inspired by good will 
and directed by sound wisdom. Such a man was George Peabody..

GEORGE PEABODY IN ENGLAND 
  
SIR ESME HOWARD 
British Ambassador to the United States 
  
There are few men whom I would more gladly honor than George 
Peabody, and it was for this reason that, when your President so 
kindly invited me to be present on this occasion, I at once accepted his 
invitation. 
I remember well when I was a small boy seven years old hearing 
George Peabody talked of by my mother and by my nurse. His bene- 
factions, his death, the unusual honors accorded at his funeral, made 
him a sort of hero of saga all through the England of the late 1860’s 
and early 1870’s. He was classed in my mind at that early age with 
such men as the Prince Consort, the husband of Queen Victoria, and 
Lord Shaftesbury, the promoter of the legislation for the protection of 
children working in our factories—in fact, the father of all factory 
laws. I merely mention this to show you the sort of pedestal Peabody 
occupied in the mind of a small boy living up in a remote country vil- 
lage in Northern England. You can imagine the feeling there was 
for him in London. Peabody was, in fact, at that time as well known 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
First Day,—Howard 43, 
and as much admired in England as James Bryce was and still is in 
America, although for different reasons. This is the only parallel I 
can find, and it will serve to convey to you the feeling there was for 
him in the England of that date. 
While he lived, Queen Victoria, who held him very high, offered him 
all sorts of honors; but the only one of which he would accept was her 
portrait, which still hangs in the Peabody Institute, at Peabody. 
When he died, he received a great public funeral in Westminster Ab- 
bey, such as rarely, if ever, has been accorded to one who was not a 
British subject, and his body was brought back to America in a 
British battleship—a supreme honor, granted generally only to for- 
eign rulers or their representatives. His funeral in the town of Pea- 
body was attended by the son of Queen Victoria, then known as Prince 
Arthur and now as the Duke of Connaught. Greater honors than 
these the British sovereign and people could not confer on any for- 
eigner—if, indeed, we can call Peabody a foreigner in England, for he 
lived so long among us, made the greater part of his fortune in Lon- 
don, and also gave away half a million pounds for the erection of good 
workmen’s dwellings in London. 
It is satisfactory to record that the Peabody Trust, which he founded 
for this purpose and endowed with his truly princely gifts, goes on 
working still, and that no less than twenty-five large apartment houses 
for workingmen have been built with the proceeds of it in various 
parts of London where such buildings are considered most needed, 
while the assets of the trust have under wise administration increased 
fourfold. 
I myself had some considerable experience, nearly thirty years ago, 
of the poorer districts of London, and know what miserable dwellings 
and overcrowding existed in that immense city, and doubtless still 
exist, for the evil was too great to be remedied in a year or in a gen- 
eration. Much has been done, much has still to be done; but to Pea- 
body remains the glory and honor of having been the first to point the 
way, and, not content with pointing the way, to set aside a great part 
of his fortune to this end. 
Americans going to London may see the statue which was set up 
in his honor in one of the most crowded parts of the heart of the old 
city of London at the entrance of Lombard Street and Cornhill. Yet 
of him it may be said quite as truly as of Wren in St. Paul’s, Si monu- 
mentum requiris, cireumspice—“If you want a monument, look around 
you;” for in every poor district of London you will find one of the 
workmen’s apartment houses, well kept, well aired, supplied with water 
and all necessary conveniences at a low and reasonable rent for respec-
-P-A-G-E-48
44 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
table workmen’s families. How much comfort has not this great 
charity of Mr. Peabody’s conferred on thousands of workmen and 
their families, how many children have not benefited by being 
brought up in airy and healthy homes instead of foul slums, how much 
has the state itself not benefited as the years roll on! Why, the ben- 
efit to the public must have been incalculable, and it is good that the 
memory of such a benefactor should be kept green and fresh in the 
minds of men. 
One cannot help thinking that if the municipalities of London— 
and, indeed, of other cities—had been in those days allowed to bor- 
row at low rates of interest from the state for the purpose of erect- 
ing municipal dwellings after the pattern of the Peabody dwellings, 
a large scheme of housing reform might have been carried out years 
ago and saved us many difficulties to-day. But in those days this 
would have been called “socialistic,” and we were obsessed and gov- 
erned by doctrines of laissez faire and extreme individualism, which 
allowed gerry-builders to put up thousands of cheap and mean dwell- 
ings and make large fortunes out of the transaction. For the state to 
have engaged in any building transaction would have been considered 
an unwarrantable interference with these doctrines and contrary to 
all the then accepted principles of political economy. Heaven only 
knows what we are suffering to-day for the mistakes made during 
the last century in regard to this gerry-building of our great indus- 
trial cities—mistakes which could and ought to have been avoided if 
it had been understood that political economy is a science which should 
take into consideration as much the lives and the well-being of the 
citizens of the state as the production and accumulation of wealth. 
Well, as a man sows, so will he reap; and as then we failed to profit 
by the lesson set by Mr. Peabody, we now reap the natural reward in 
the growth of a socialism which threatens, though I do not believe that 
it will succeed, to sap the very foundations of private property, on 
which all individual liberty and the spiritual and material well-being 
of man are surely built up. 
But to return to Mr. Peabody. Of what he had done for us in 
England, I had, before I was asked to address you to-day, some knowl- 
edge; but of the man himself, very little; and, unfortunately, from the 
books and pamphlets about him which have fallen into my hands I 
have been able to gather but the most meager details. That he was 
a poor boy, sprung from an old and honorable New England and Old 
England stock ; that he made his way from the humblest beginning, by 
sheer honesty, integrity, hard work, and intelligence, to be the pos- 
sessor of a colossal fortune which he used for the benefit of his fellow
-P-A-G-E-49
  First Day,—Howard 45 
men—these are about all the facts I could gather from the collection 
of rather pompous speeches in the style of the day which were deliv- 
ered on various occasions in England and America. Out of his own 
speeches I could find next to nothing that would throw light on the 
real character of the man. 
There is one description of him I may quote, which is fully borne 
out by his portraits: “Mr. Peabody was slightly above the medium 
height. His full, round face beamed with goodness. He laughed sel- 
dom, but had a smile for everybody. There was nothing ideal or poet- 
ical about his face; it was what we tritely call ‘a good face.’ He never 
spoke hurriedly. His nature was not impulsive.” 
Elsewhere I read: “He was fond of backgammon and whist, and 
passionately fond of fishing; very fond of singing, Scottish songs his 
favorites.” 
The London Times, in an obituary notice, said of him: “He was 
an ardent patriot, and loved abroad as much as at home. He was no 
courtier, yet he was honored by sovereigns and princes. He was 
profuse in his charity, which pauperized nobody. There was nothing 
hard or narrow about his philanthropy. He simply did whatever 
good came in his way.” 
Although in London he lived most simply in a small bachelor apart- 
ment, he greatly enjoyed entertaining his friends and traveling Amer- 
icans, and always gave a banquet on the Fourth of July. 
I venture to make the following quotations from some of his 
speeches, which throw light on his character: 
“Bear in mind that to be truly great it is not necessary that you 
should gain wealth and importance.” 
“My earnest wish to promote at all times a spirit of harmony and 
good will in society, my aversion to intolerance, bigotry, and party 
rancor, and an enduring respect and love for the happy institutions of 
our prosperous republic, impel me to express the wish that the insti- 
tute I have proposed to you shall be always strictly guarded against 
the possibility of being made a theater for the discrimination or dis- 
cussion of sectarian theology or party politics; that it shall never min- 
ister, in any way whatever, to political dissension, to infidelity, to 
visionary theories of a pretended philosophy which may be aimed at 
the subversion of the approved morals of society.” 
But there is one phrase in a speech of his I read somewhere which 
gives a sudden intimate insight into the character of the man. On 
one occasion he said something like this: “It is not easy at the start 
to part with the wealth we have accumulated after years of hard work 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
    46 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
and difficulty. But I advise you to try; for if you do, you will find it 
very pleasant.” 
Never surely was a truth spoken more directly, simply, and straight- 
forwardly: “You will find it very pleasant.” There is no doubt that 
the greatest pleasure he got from his wealth was in giving judi- 
ciously—not in aimless charity, but in such a way as to do permanent 
good. 
So little by little we can build up a picture of the man. Benign; a 
hater of strife and faction; fond of homely pastimes; hospitable to 
his friends; simple in his own life; a hard worker in his own business, 
but ever fair to others; courteous and kindly to all, whether prince or 
pauper, and thus the very reverse of the snob; no brilliant genius, but 
in his sheer goodness of heart a great man, if ever there was one, be- 
cause he was in the best sense of the word a great gentleman. 
When his statue was unveiled in London by the then Prince of Wales, 
afterwards King Edward the VII, the American Minister, Mr. Mot- 
ley, the historian, quoted a famous epitaph of a man who was known 
as “the good Earl of Devon.” It runs thus: “What I spent, that I 
had; what I saved, that I lost; that which I gave away remains with 
me.” Thatistrue. The great gifts of Mr. Peabody remain with him 
in the memory which is cherished of him on both sides of the At- 
lantic. 
If ever there was a builder of a good understanding between the two 
nations of Great Britain and America, it was George Peabody. Ata 
time when feeling ran high between the two countries, during the 
American Civil War, he continued to-love both and to multiply his 
benefactions in both. He hated strife and dissension, and would 
never lend himself to it. He never seems to have uttered one word 
that could increase irritation or cause anger, and this, as much as his 
charitable gifts, gives him his title to greatness and his right to our 
gratitude. Those were before the days when Anglo-American friend- 
ship and good will were so much talked of or promoted as now. 
But who can doubt that he loved both countries and desired to see them 
working in the closest harmony for the good of the world? I can- 
not but believe that were he alive to-day, nothing would give him 
greater pleasure than the sight of these two nations, with their bound- 
less opportunities for promoting the peace of the world, gradually 
throwing off their old-time distrusts and suspicions of each other and 
moving toward a friendship which is better, a thousand times better, 
than all the written alliances in the world. 
The other day in an old and forgotten novel by John Oliver Hobbes 
I came across a profound truth hidden under the form of a paradox.
-P-A-G-E-51
First Day,—Howard AT 
It is this: “It is only a very unselfish man who cares to be loved; the 
majority prefer to love—it lays them under fewer obligations.” 
George Peabody was never afraid of the obligations that being loved 
imposed on him. He always responded to those obligations in such a 
way as to be still more loved, and so to increase them. 
And now one word more. I noticed in a speech made the other day 
by the President of the United States to a meeting of journalists two 
aphorisms which followed hard on each other and may seem to be in 
contradiction, but really are not. The first was: ‘After all, the chief 
business of the American people is business.” The second was: “The 
chief ideal of the American people is idealism.”” With regard to the 
first, the President was careful to observe: “In all experience the ac- 
cumulation of wealth means the multiplication of schools, the increase 
of knowledge, the dissemination of intelligence, the encouragement of 
science, the broadening of outlook, the expansion of liberties, the 
widening of culture.” But he qualified these by adding: “Of course, 
the accumulation of wealth cannot be justified as the chief end of ex- 
istence, but we are compelled to recognize it as a means to well-nigh 
every desirable achievement.” And he then quoted recent reports 
from the papers to the effect that two leaders of American business 
had recently given fifty to sixty million dollars as endowments to 
educational work. 
Well, gentlemen, so long as business and idealism go hand in hand 
in this way, no one will, I believe, be found to quarrel with the accumu- 
lation of wealth in private hands. The great justification of great 
wealth—perhaps the only justification of it—is to be found in great 
service to country and to fellow men. We can all remember a saying 
about riches and the kingdom of heaven and a camel and a needle’s 
eye; we can all remember the story of the rich young man who went 
away sorrowing. George Peabody, as we have seen from one sen- 
tence of his that I have quoted, had his difficulties in overcoming the 
natural aversion to parting with his wealth of any man who has 
struggled and toiled to acquire and accumulate it; but he overcame 
the temptation merely to save and accumulate more. He did not go 
away sorrowing when he heard the call of conscience. He gave with 
both hands—a willing giver, such as God loves—and we have his word 
for it that he found it “very pleasant.” We may feel sure he solved 
that apparently insoluble problem of the camel and the needle’s eye. 
In the Middle Ages it was a common thing for the rich to found hos- 
pitals and colleges, to build churches and cathedrals and town halls 
and great public buildings, and to collect galleries of pictures and 
statues in order to beautify their cities. You may find such all over 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  48 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
Europe. It was a custom which went out of fashion to a great extent 
after the sixteenth century, though there were some notable excep- 
tions. Fortunately, now the feeling that wealth has its obligations 
as well as its rights is certainly again on the increase, and one of the 
men who has set a most shining example in this respect was George 
Peabody. I honor him because of this shining example, which has 
since been followed by other men wealthier than he. So long as Amer- 
icans, whose main business is business and whose ideal is idealism, 
can combine these two activities in so noble and practical a way as 
Peabody; so long as the possessors of wealth take pride in using it 
for the benefit of their country, their city, or their fellow men, we 
may be sure that there will be little criticism of the accumulation of 
great wealth in a few hands. It is then its own justification. 
But I honor George Peabody not only for this; I also honor him 
because, being essentially American, he yet loved England, and be- 
cause he interpreted America so well to England, and thus laid the 
foundation of that mutual friendship and good will between us which, 
I thank God, in spite of certain obstacles of prejudice and tradition, 
is increasing from year to year. 
THE TRUSTEES OF THE PEABODY EDUCATION 
FUND AND THEIR WORK 
  
J. W. BRISTER 
President of West Tennessee Teachers College 
  
The trustees of the Peabody Education Fund constituted a remark- 
able body of men, and any study of that body—whether from the 
standpoint of its personnel, its commission, or its activities and influ- 
ence—is full of interest and significance. 
No more distinguished group ever administered a private or public 
trust. No body of the same size ever contained more notables—more 
men with national and international reputation, eminent in business, 
inthe professions, in statesmanship. 
<. Consider that original group of sixteen men named by George Pea- 
body. There was Winthrop—for twenty-seven years chairman of the 
board and largely its directing influence, Speaker of the national 
House of Representatives, Governor, Senator, and orator; Grant— 
commanding general of the United States Army and later President of 
the United States; Farragut—admiral and ranking officer of the
-P-A-G-E-53
  First Day,—Brister 49 
United States Navy ; Evarts—distinguished lawyer, Attorney-General 
of the United States, Secretary of State, Governor, Senator, foreign 
minister, and great orator; Fish—Representative in Congress, Sen- 
ator, Governor, foreign minister, cabinet officer; Rives—member of 
Congress, minister to France, Senator, member of the Confederate 
States Congress, and a writer of note; Graham—United States Sen- 
ator, Governor, Secretary of the Navy, Senator in the Southern Con- 
federacy ; Aiken—Governor, member of Congress, pioneer rice planter, 
scientific farmer, leader in many economic and social movements; 
MclIlvaine—teacher, bishop, college president, and author. 
It was indeed a remarkable body, representative of the best thought 
of America. Three of them were from New England, four from the 
Middle Atlantic states, five from the South, and two from the Middle 
West. It was no indiscriminate selection. There was design on the 
part of the founder of the Peabody Trust, and that design was re- 
flected in the character of the men he chose and the various points of 
view they were prepared to represent. 
There were forty others named from time to time by the board it- 
self. Among them were four presidents of the United States, two 
chief justices of the United States Supreme Court, eight or ten cabinet 
officers, many foreign ministers, governors, senators, jurists, soldiers, 
financiers, preachers, educators—outstanding men of America, lead- 
ers locally and nationally. 
It is worthy of note that these trustees, many of whom had been 
honored by high public office, all of whom had achieved eminent suc- 
cess in the business or professional world, regarded their position on 
the Peabody Board as one of high honor, as is attested by their long- 
continued service. The sixteen trustees originally named served for 
a period of 216 years, or an average of 1314 years; the other forty 
gave 518 years of service, or 13 years for each man. Dr. Samuel A. 
Green, of Massachusetts, appointed in 1883, had the longest contin- 
uous service, having been a member until the trust was dissolved, a 
period of thirty-one years. Another distinguished member of the 
board, next in tenure of office, was Governor James D. Porter, of 
Tennessee, and no man rendered more distinguished or loyal service 
to the board and to the institutions it fostered. 
It was a long-lived board, and this very fact explains in part the 
valuable contribution it made to the educational history of the coun- 
try. Such tenure of office on the part of such a distinguished group 
of men could only result in notable service of nation-wide influence.
-P-A-G-E-54
  50 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
THEIR COMMISSION 
One cannot interpret satisfactorily the services of the Peabody 
Board except in the light of the commission placed upon them. This 
commission came from George Peabody, a native of New England, 
born and reared in humble circumstances, who, with no favoring ad- 
vantages save such as are within the reach of any American boy, had, 
by his great native ability, his forceful character, and his determined 
effort, achieved eminent financial success on two continents; and now, 
an old man past seventy years of age, he was consummating his philan- 
thropies by his memorable gift in behalf of popular education. As 
one contemplates the life and character of Peabody, he thinks of three 
phrases—an intelligent patriotism, a simple faith in God, and a high 
sense of responsibility—as best characterizing him and giving the 
only satisfactory explanation of his philanthropy and its far-reaching 
effects. 
He was an intelligent patriot. He had studied the conditions and 
knew the needs of his native land in the critical period to which it had 
come. He looked upon the South not only as that section which had 
“suffered from the destructive ravages of civil war,” but as a part of 
his beloved country, and he hoped that his donation would prove a 
boon not only to the South, but to all the country. He had a high 
sense of responsibility, which was exhibited in great benefactions in 
England, in large and appropriate donations to the place of his birth, 
by his greatest of all services in stimulating the establishment of edu- 
cational systems in the South, and which expressed itself in his classic 
characterization of, “Education, a debt due from present to future 
generations.” His simple, childlike faith in God is expressed in all 
the letters he wrote, in all the conferences he held, and in all the plans 
for humankind that he unfolded. 
It may be observed right here that the great constructive periods of 
American history have been those in which the dominant characters 
had this faith in God which characterized Peabody and his fellow 
workers in the days of reconstruction, and Washington and his com- 
patriots in the beginning of the republic. A sense of God is the 
greatest asset of the human race, individually or collectively, and no 
generation has improved its day or made substantial contribution to 
human weal without it. 
George Peabody could not write that great letter under date of 
February 7, 1867, which instituted the Peabody Trust, without invok- 
ing the blessing of God upon his gift; and at the meeting in Washing- 
ton afterwards, where great plans were discussed and great enter- 
prises projected, George Peabody and his distinguished board had to
-P-A-G-E-55
  
First Day,—Brister 51 
kneel in prayer for guidance and direction, which was no formal cer- 
emony, but the reverent expression of men of faith. 
No ordinary man and no ordinary task could have commanded such 
exalted talents as were found in the Peabody Board. But here was 
an extraordinary character, a man of his age and for his age, who, 
like many another great character, had come into his kingdom for just 
such a time as this. He had vision, and he projected an enterprise 
that was glorified by his unselfishness and made appeal by its very 
nature to the noblest men of his time. Never was higher trust com- 
mitted to nobler hands. Here high trust and noble character met, 
each ennobling the other and together resulting in enterprises and 
activities which have made better and richer the whole country and 
many generations. 
Let Peabody give in his own words his commission to these men. 
It was expressed by word of mouth to Mr. Winthrop, his lifelong 
friend, and by that famous letter of February 7, 1867, to the men 
whom he had chosen to execute his trust. He had a confidential in- 
terview with Mr. Winthrop preceding the public announcement, and, 
after detailing many proposed benefactions, he said: “And now I 
come to the last. You may be surprised when you learn precisely 
what it is, but it is the one nearest my heart and the one for which I 
shall do the most here and hereafter.’”’ And then, as the record goes, 
he proceeded to unfold his plans for aid in developing education in the 
Southern states. Details of his aims and desires are contained in his 
letter to the original trustees read at their meeting in Washington on 
February 8, 1867. In that famous letter he states that he had long 
and seriously considered “the educational needs of those portions of 
our beloved and common country which have suffered most from the 
destructive ravages and the not less disastrous consequences of civil 
war.” He speaks of his growing devotion to his native land and, as 
the shadows lengthen about his life, his hope and faith in its glo- 
rious future; he tells of his vision—the vision of an old man—of his 
“country united and prosperous, emerging from the clouds which still 
surround her, taking a higher rank among the nations, and becoming 
richer and more powerful than ever before;” and then, with a breadth 
of statesmanship rarely equaled and a philosophy of national pros- 
perity founded on eternal principles, he insists that “moral and intel- 
lectual development should keep pace with material growth,” if there 
is to be any abiding prosperity. He refers to the duty and privilege 
of more highly favored sections of the country contributing to the 
development of that section which had suffered most in the war—the 
first great statement, so far as I know, of the need of a fund for the
-P-A-G-E-56
  52 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
purpose of equalizing educational opportunities among the states of 
the Union. Having thus shown his broad knowledge of conditions 
in his native land and explained that the purpose of his actions was 
not temporary relief, but the securing of a prosperous and reunited 
country, his high sense of individual responsibility asserts itself, and 
he says: “With the wish to discharge, so far as I may be able, my 
own responsibility in this matter, as well as to gratify my desire to aid 
those to whom I am bound by so many ties of attachment and re- 
gard’”’—and then comes the great commission—“I give you gentlemen 
the sum of $1,000,000, to be by you and your successors held in trust 
and the income thereof used and applied at your discretion for the 
promotion and encouragement of intellectual, moral, and industrial 
education among the young of the most destitute portions of the South- 
ern and Southwestern states of our Union.” 
Sometimes the motives of makers of large gifts are called into ques- 
tion; sometimes philanthropy seems to be a cloak behind which privi- 
lege hides; but the records reveal no finger of suspicion ever pointed 
at George Peabody. Such was his character, such the probity of his 
life, that his act has never been questioned. 
Never in all history has there been a more unselfish deed or one ac- 
tuated by purer motives. It was so regarded by the times in which 
he lived, by men in all parts of his beloved country; and the succeed- 
ing years have brought a deeper gratitude for the munificent benefac- 
tion and higher respect and admiration for the generous donor. 
Other men have given more largely, but none more sincerely, and up 
to his time perhaps none had exceeded his generous donation in the 
cause of general education, and certainly no gift has had more far- 
reaching effects on the history of a great people. 
This first donation of $1,000,000 was increased in 1869, when a 
third letter was addressed by Mr. Peabody to the trustees, in which 
he expressed gratitude for their response to his commission and ap- 
probation of enterprises already projected, and at the same time 
placed in their hands another million dollars to be used in carrying 
out their great plans. 
ACTIVITIES AND INFLUENCE 
The Peabody Board was not only composed of distinguished men; 
it won distinction by the educational policies it adopted and the enter- 
prises it fostered. Not only did the trustees have a great commission 
intrusted to them by a great man, but they showed themselves mas- 
ters of the situation in which they were placed by their activities in 
executing it.
-P-A-G-E-57
  
First Day,—Brister 53 
The significance of the Peabody Board does not consist in the stand- 
ing and achievements of the individuals who composed the board, not 
even in the noble purpose for which it was organized, but in the plans 
which it projected, the wise utilization of its funds in executing these 
plans, and in the influence which its activities have exerted on Amer- 
ican history and education. 
The “two grand objects” which the board set out to accomplish were 
the promotion of common-school education and the professional train- 
ing of teachers. At the second meeting of the board, held in New 
York, March, 1867, resolutions were adopted favoring these two ob- 
jects, and thereby the policy of the board was fixed and its course of 
action determined. Dr. Barnas Sears, then president of Brown Uni- 
versity, was present at the New York meeting on the invitation of 
Mr. Winthrop, and was elected general agent of the board. He im- 
mediately proceeded to make a tour of the South and to study educa- 
tional conditions, and in his first report to the board elaborated cer- 
tain details by which the objects originally expressed were to be 
accomplished. He recommended that in promoting primary or com- 
mon-school education the board should confine its activities to public 
schools; that schools in which large numbers could be congregated 
should be aided to the end that models might be established which 
would influence educational development in the surrounding territory ; 
that efforts should be made to improve state systems, and that the 
board should work through public agencies, state and local; that spe- 
cial attention should be given to the training of teachers, and that 
normal schools should be fostered and encouraged. 
This program is significant. The field of education in the South 
was undeveloped. State public-school systems existed only in name, 
and the Peabody Board were pioneers. It is easy to understand 
their recognition of the need of developing the public primary schools. 
Democratic government rests on an educated citizenship, and any 
move to help any people in any country must begin with the educa- 
tion of the masses. The board also recognized that there could be no 
system of public education which does not include the training of 
teachers. Even with a system of primary schools there must go pro- 
vision for the training of teachers for such schools; and however the 
system of education may develop, to include high schools, industrial 
schools, and other types of instruction, there must at the same time 
be provision for training teachers for the schools established. As 
stated by Dr. Sears in one of his reports to the board, “no system of 
public education is complete which does not embrace professional
-P-A-G-E-58
54 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
schools where the science of education and the art of teaching are 
regularly and thoroughly taught.” 
The Peabody Board recognized from the outset the necessary con- 
nection between any type of public schools and teacher-training facili- 
ties, and its original plan contemplated the preparation of teachers 
as involved in the promotion of common-school education. That this 
is a far-reaching and novel idea is attested by the fact that it has not 
yet been universally accepted. To use a local illustration, it may be 
affirmed that in Tennessee, while normal schools are regarded as a part 
of the system of public education, it is not yet thoroughly and univer- 
sally established that they are an essential part. They are regarded 
as adjuncts of the public schools, supplements to the elementary and 
high schools; but the idea that they are fundamental to the elementary 
and high schools, that the latter cannot function satisfactorily with- 
out them, has not yet taken firm hold of the public mind. It is not 
unusual to hear the assertion in legislative halls and in gatherings of 
representative men that money given to the normal schools is being 
taken from the elementary schools, and, therefore, that the appropri- 
ations for normal schools must be kept as low as possible. 
At this particular time there is a widespread sentiment in our state 
for a minimum school term of eight months. It is so popular that 
both political parties have favored it in their platforms, and all news- 
papers and politicians, as well as school men, advocate it. It is highly 
probable that favorable legislative action will be taken during the 
present session of the General Assembly. But with this popular en- 
thusiasm for the elementary schools, there is little recognition of the 
need of improving and developing the normal schools already estab- 
lished in order to make the longer-term schools effective. 
It would be a fine thing for Tennessee if the people of the state had 
the wisdom and the vision which characterized the Peabody Board 
and its agents fifty-seven years ago, when they came to the solemn 
conclusion to promote common-school education and included in their 
program the training of teachers as a necessary feature in the pro- 
motion of common-school education. 
The wisdom of the board’s plan is evident when one considers con- 
ditions which existed in the section it was to serve when it came into 
being. It was the period of reconstruction. The South was bank- 
rupt financially, and the educational situation was deplorable. The 
condition is best described in the words of Dr. J. L. M. Curry, who 
succeeded Dr. Sears as general agent of the Peabody Board: “Perhaps 
the most significant fact in connection with the aims and purposes of 
the trust was that, at its origin, not a single Southern state within 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  
First Day,—Brister 55) 
the field of its operations had a system of free public schools, and only 
in a few cities were any such schools to be found.” 
Writing further of the educational condition of the South, Dr. Curry 
says that in Georgia no law establishing public schools had yet been 
passed; that Florida had on the statute books a good system, but the 
revenues were uncertain; that Alabama reported a school fund of 
about a half million dollars and about 4,000 schools in operation for 
four months in the year; that the state school fund in North Carolina 
would not exceed $300,000, and that there were 750,000 children to be 
provided for. It is also stated that public free schools were opened 
for the first time in the history of Texas in 1871. In Tennessee, al- 
though there had been sporadic attempts at public schools for many 
years previous and schools were progressing reasonably well in some 
centers of population, there was no general school law passed until 
1873. 
There was a wide field for educational effort, and the need was so 
great that the assistance of the Peabody Board was welcomed in all 
sections. Dr. Sears went from place to place, conducting a continu- 
ous educational campaign, visiting and addressing schools, teachers’ 
associations, legislative bodies, boards of education, aiding school 
systems financially wherever there were promising results, stimulat- 
ing self-help, and establishing the need of “thorough and well-sus- 
tained systems of free schools.” It was well-directed labor. It was 
this codperation on the part of the Peabody Board which encouraged 
the South, brought educational order out of existing chaos, and set in 
operation a system of public schools. 
In making comparison with the beginning period and twenty years 
later it has been pointed out that “one of the best evidences of prog- 
ress and of the influence of the fund is to be found in the fact that 
every one of the Southern states lias now a public system of schools, 
more or less complete, with normal schools for both races.” No force 
making for the progress of education in the South was greater than 
Peabody’s benefaction and the board’s activities in administering it. 
It is a temptation at this point to take time to pay a tribute to the 
intelligence and diplomacy, the wisdom and zeal of that patriot and 
educator, Dr. Barnas Sears, in executing the activities of the board 
for the first ten or twelve years. It took wisdom as well as philan- 
thropy to make so great a gift in a satisfactory manner to our war- 
torn country in the days of reconstruction, and it took intelligence of 
a high order as well as a noble spirit to approach the people who were 
the beneficiaries of the gift and to make contributions in such a, man- 
ner as to win esteem as well as gratitude.  
-P-A-G-E-60
  56 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
George Peabody never intended to be, and never was, regarded as a 
patron of the South. Barnas Sears and the board whose agent he 
was never sought to dominate or dictate educational policies. The 
gift of Peabody and its distribution by his board was whole-hearted 
and unreserved, designed only to aid and stimulate self-activity. Dr. 
Sears and the Peabody Board early formed the policy of dealing 
through public agencies, and so generously and sympathetically was 
the trust administered that it gave an impetus to public-school devel- 
opment which could not have come through ordinary channels except 
through a long period of time. 
How thoroughly the Peabody Board was committed to the accom- 
plishment of its two great objects and how persistently it adhered 
thereto are exhibited in a study of its expenditures over a period of 
forty-six years. The first donations of the board were made in 1868, 
and the last in 1914, when the Peabody Fund was distributed. Dur- 
ing this period of forty-six years the board gave for various pur- 
poses the interest on their fund, amounting to $3,650,556. Of this 
amount, $1,148,183, or thirty-one per cent of the grand total distrib- 
uted, was used for the promotion of free public schools in large cen- 
ters. The bulk of its expenditures, amounting to $2,272,923, or 
sixty-two per cent of the total, went for teacher-training purposes. 
This large amount for teacher training was distributed among nor- 
mal schools, teachers’ institutes, George Peabody College, and for 
scholarships in that institution; $759,122 went direct to normal 
schools; $382,755 to teachers’ institutes in various states; Peabody 
College received $550,381 for maintenance; and $580,665 provided 
scholarships for young men and young women who came to Peabody 
College to prepare for teaching in their home states. 
The expenditures by years is very significant. In 1868 an appro- 
priation was made for city schools, amounting to $70,000, and this 
appropriation continued to rise for several years, culminating in 1874, 
when it amounted to $155,000. From that time it began to decline, 
and it ceased to be any considerable sum after 1882, the total amount 
for this purpose from that time until the dissolution of the trust 
amounting to less than $100,000. 
There is an interesting bit of history involved in this story. Dr. 
Sears realized that as the years advanced the public-school system 
was becoming more firmly established, and in 1879 he could write as 
follows: “Of the two grand objects which the board has from time to 
time had in view—namely, the promotion of common-school educa- 
tion and the professional training of teachers—the former, or pri- 
mary one, has been so far attained that it may, in great part, be 
   
-P-A-G-E-61
  
First Day,—Brister 57 
safely left in the hands of the people and our chief attention hence- 
forth be given to the latter.” And this is just the story as told by 
the expenditures of the Peabody Board. Just as the amount ex- 
pended for aid to public schools was considerable in the beginning and 
began to decline after a period, so we find that in the first year a 
small appropriation was made to normal schools, amounting only to 
$9,900, and that this amount continued to increase, reaching approxi- 
mately $70,000 in 1882, and continuing to be between $50,000 and 
$70,000 each year thereafter. There could not have been any con- 
siderable amount for teacher training in the first year, because, ac- 
cording to Curry, “strictly speaking, there was not a normal school 
in the whole area covered by the fund; but they sprang up with facil- 
ity, and applications were numerous and urgent.” 
The other expenditures of the Peabody Board amounted to seven 
per cent of the total, including the sum given for summer schools, 
which might appropriately be considered as a teacher-training project ; 
for educational campaigns all over the South; for rural public schools 
and the supervision of the same, for which more than $115,000 was 
expended; and for educational journals and miscellaneous purposes. 
It will be seen that the Peabody Board not only resolved to accomplish 
two great objects, but they devoted their energies and expended their 
resources for these two purposes. It is also borne in upon us that in 
working out their primary aim they found it increasingly necessary 
to concentrate on the second object, the training of teachers; and so 
through the years of its trust it made its biggest contribution to the 
educational development of the section it was designed to serve by the 
aid and stimulus given to the professional training of teachers. 
In continuing our study of the work of the Peabody Board we come 
to a climax, and that is a great central professional institution, the 
George Peabody College for Teachers, which has grown out of the 
benefactions of the great philanthropist. / Let us recur to a quotation 
from the report made to the board by Dr. Sears in October, 1876: 
“No system of public instruction is complete which does not embrace 
professional schools where the science of education and the art of 
teaching are regularly and thoroughly taught. The Southern states 
are now so far under way in their systems of education as to be pre- 
pared for a new step in this direction. A splendid example will be 
found in the recent establishment of a great normal school at Nash- 
ville for the state of Tennessee.” 
Peabody College had its beginning in 1875, just fifty years ago. 
Dr. Sears had previously visited Nashville, and had conferred with 
educators, legislators, and other state officials concerning normal-
-P-A-G-E-62
58 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
school work in Tennessee; but it took time to make even a beginning, 
since it appeared that state aid could not be afforded. The way 
opened, however, when the trustees of the University of Nashville 
generously offered their campus and buildings, a substantial plant in 
those days, and a considerable part of their income for the new enter- 
prise. This old university had an honored name and had played a 
conspicuous part in the development of its territory. The war had 
wrought havoc with it, as with all institutions and enterprises in the 
South, and temporarily it had ceased to function in a collegiate sense. 
Here was its opportunity; and with a high sense of its obligation to 
serve, the institution gave its all—its name, its plant, its income, its 
prestige—to the new enterprise. 
So into this old temple came a new living organism. It was like 
breathing the breath of life into a material body, and it became a liv- 
ing soul. The old institution, thereafter popularly called “Peabody 
College,” but legally serving as a university, carried on with increas- 
ing importance and success. 
~There is no more unselfish act in all the history of education than 
this subordination of itself by the University of Nashville in behalf 
of Peabody College. The trustees may not have known, but it was 
inevitable, that the new idea, the teacher-training idea, would come 
to be the life and constitute the significance of the reorganized insti- 
tution. 
Peabody College thus had a modest beginning. It is not probable 
that its promoters suspected the greatness that was to come. Its first 
announcement claimed only local significance, yet it seemed to be de- 
signed that this new school in Tennessee would serve as a model for 
other Southern states. As a matter of fact, it did. While it had a 
checkered career, filled with uncertainty in its earlier days, when inad- 
equate recognition by the state of Tennessee seemed to necessitate its 
removal elsewhere, it continued to expand; and when in 1877 a system 
of scholarships was instituted, by means of which chosen young men 
and women from every Southern state were given an opportunity at 
Peabody to prepare for teaching in their home state, the influence of 
the institution began to be felt far beyond the borders of Tennessee 
and in all parts of the territory served by the Peabody Board. A 
large proportion of the income of the board was expended for scholar- 
ships. Beginning in 1878 with $5,300, it rose as high as $25,000 per 
year, and totaled in the period of twenty-six years nearly $600,000. 
Unquestionably this policy of the board contributed to the primacy 
of Peabody College among teacher-training institutions, and at the 
same time enlarged the influence of the Peabody Board. The board
-P-A-G-E-63
  
First Day,—Brister 59 
was also making annually increasing appropriations for the main- 
tenance of the college, and thereby enabling it to make a growing 
appeal to all parts of the South and to affect every phase of education. 
In consequence, the board soon came to recognize the large significance 
of their central institution in Southern education. Mr. Winthrop, 
in an address to the board on October 2, 1891, said: “We certainly did 
not establish our Normal College at Nashville with a view to favor 
Tennessee above other Southern states; our whole object was the 
training of teachers for all the Southern states.” 
The place of Peabody College was firmly established by 1894, not 
only in the minds of the board which fostered it, but by educators 
generally throughout the South. The enlarging of the curriculum in 
1887, the increasing revenues supplied by the board and by the state, 
the growing number of scholarships, and the constantly enlarged out- 
put of the college, all showed the wisdom of the board and their pur- 
pose to make their contribution to the South and to the nation more 
and more through this institution. Peabody College became, as has 
been suggested, “not only the sponsor for the doctrine of professional 
training of teachers, but the mother of normal schools.” 
If one looks for the monumental work of the Peabody Board, its out- 
standing contribution to education, he may be given the advice that 
is inscribed on the Cathedral of St. Paul in London: “St monumentum 
requiris, circumspice.” After considering all other activities and 
giving due weight to the influences exerted, it must be agreed that 
Peabody College is its great achievement and the enduring monument 
to its illustrious founder. Thousands of teachers all over the South- 
ern country, working in elementary schools, high schools, normal 
schools, and colleges, in places of instruction, supervision, and admin- 
istration, in carrying out plans and initiating them, bear testimony 
to this effect. A thousand streams of influence flow from this foun- 
tain source and carry the living waters of knowledge and truth to 
every corner of the South. 
At one time there appeared a doubt as to whether the Peabody 
Board was going to finally endow the college it so long had fostered ; 
but in the eternal fitness of things that doubt was dissipated when in 
1914 the board did the natural, the logical, and, in the light of later 
developments, the wise thing, consummating their great activities of 
forty-seven years by giving the larger part of their funds to perpet- 
uate the name of George Peabody in the great institution which had 
been the agency through which his generous benefaction had carried 
its blessings to the South and thereby to all of his beloved country. 
Again, when the endowment was made and a greater Peabody College  
-P-A-G-E-64
60 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
was assured, doubt arose as to the relation between the Peabody of 
other years and the new institution to be located on another campus. 
But a great man was chosen to direct the destiny of the George Pea- 
body College for Teachers, and he was too wise to sacrifice forty 
years of glorious history, of noble tradition, and immortal influence. 
Rather would he hold fast to what had been done and erect thereon 
an enduring edifice. That is why we are here to-day in a semi-centen- 
nial celebration rather than one which commemorates merely an event- 
ful and important decade of a new era. 
This institution is redolent of the spirit and deeds of George Pea- 
body. It perpetuates his honored name, and it is the heir of all the 
glorious deeds of the Peabody trustees, their general agents, and those 
who have collaborated with them. It treasures the names of thou- 
sands of alumni, of hundreds of consecrated instructors who have 
labored within its hallowed walls, of a great host of beneficiaries and 
well-wishers scattered all over the country and the whole world. 
Blessings on George Peabody and his illustrious board for this great 
institution, a lighthouse on a hill, radiating knowledge and virtue and 
truth to the remotest corners of the earth! 
The magnificence and munificence of Peabody’s gift and its far- 
reaching influence were well established if nothing further were 
added to the recital already given. It happens, however, that the act 
had political and social significance as well as educational. It was a 
most timely gift. The country had been rent in twain; and though 
hostilities had ceased, dissension and bitterness were growing daily 
worse, and the chasm between the sections was widening rather than 
receding. The Southern people were sitting amid the ashes of defeat, 
and politicians in control of state and national affairs were seeking to 
impose upon them intolerable burdens. In a misguided zeal for the 
freedmen, acts were conceived and passed which intensified hostile 
feelings and threatened to preclude the harmonizing of the two sec- 
tions. 
At such a time Peabody’s gift was made. He longed for the restora- 
tion of harmony, and was seeking an opportunity of doing something 
to consolidate the Union. It has already been pointed out that he 
hoped that his gift would “prove a permanent and lasting boon, not 
only to the Southern states, but to the whole of our dear country, 
which I have ever loved so well.” 
That his gift and the administration of it by the distinguished 
Board of Trustees had the effect he desired, there can be no doubt. 
The fund has been one of the great forces bringing the sections to- 
gether. The administration of it has had the effect of creating and  
-P-A-G-E-65
First Day,—Brister 61 
preserving a bond of peace and unity and fraternity between the 
North and the South. Coming at a time when the forces making for 
hate and dissension were at their strongest, it brought into the con- 
test an opposing force founded on love, good will, and genuine sympa- 
thy, and springing from the heart of a lover of mankind. It has been 
said that “the Peabody Educational Fund has done more to promote 
the actual welfare of the Southern states and to cement the bonds 
of the American Union than all that statesmen and politicians have 
been able to effect.” 
How has this result been accomplished? By the very nature of 
the gift and the disinterested motives by which it was inspired, by 
the important enterprises fostered by the board, by the wise adminis- 
tration of the trust through their general agents—their unostenta- 
tious service, their willingness to lend a helping hand, their working 
through regularly organized governmental channels in promoting the 
general good, with the absence of any spirit of domination or dicta- 
tion. It was this service which revived the fraternal spirit between 
the sections, which united a group of great men in the North and 
South in a common cause, and thus helped to create a better feeling 
throughout the country. 
Time may be taken to give only one example of a monumental serv- 
ice on the part of the board which had important effects. When the 
Civil Rights Bill was before Congress in 1874 and mixed schools in 
the South were proposed, Barnas Sears went to Washington, argued 
with friends of the bill, and convinced them that such action would 
overthrow all state school systems then existing and leave both whites 
and blacks destitute of schools. His argument and the influence of 
the board behind him succeeded in eliminating the proposed item. 
There were local propositions for mixed schools in South Carolina 
and Louisiana. We recall with pride and gratitude the attitude of 
Dr. Sears, which was sustained by his board, on this proposition. In 
1869 he wrote as follows: “We assume no control whatever over the 
arrangement of the schools to which assistance is accorded. We only 
wish to aid in the work of universal education. If separate schools 
are provided for the two races and both of them are pleased with the 
arrangement, we can have no embarrassment in codperating with the 
authorities. If the law requires mixed schools, and the children, 
whether white or black, generally attend them, we shall have no diffi- 
culty in our work; but if the state has only mixed schools and white 
children do not attend them, we should naturally aid not the colored 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
62 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
children who enjoy exclusively the benefit of public-school money, but 
the white children who are left to grow up in ignorance.” 
The Peabody Board unanimously adopted a resolution sustaining 
the views of the general agent, and pronounced emphatically that, in 
the judgment of the board, if compulsory legislation were passed by 
Congress in favor of mixed schools, it would be most pernicious to the 
interest of education in the communities to be affected by it. It was 
this courageous action which probably saved the South from an un- 
speakable calamity ; and when the Civil Rights Bill was passed with- 
out the offensive clause, the Southern states moved forward rapidly 
in the development of their state school systems. 
There are many other activities of the Peabody Board in the execu- 
tion of their trust and influences flowing therefrom that might be 
cited. Dr. Sears continued his valuable services until his death, in 
1880. Dr. J. L. M. Curry, of Alabama, was chosen in his stead, and 
proved himself a worthy successor during twenty-two years of ardu- 
ous service. 
The work of the board covered a period of forty-seven years. 
The trust was finally dissolved in 1914, when the board distributed the 
fund, giving the bulk of it to this College, which bears the name of the 
illustrious Peabody. 
The South is under lasting obligations to Peabody, and with the 
passing years there is a growing veneration for his name. Scarcely 
less is the debt which it owes to the great board which administered 
his trust. The debt cannot be paid, but the monument established is 
as permanent as the civilization it upholds. As long as public educa- 
tional institutions flourish in this nation this College will continue to 
serve, and schools will grow better, and democratic institutions will 
improve with them. The name of Peabody will live forever, because 
he did an unselfish deed and rendered a large and conspicuous service 
out of the great love he had for his country and for mankind.

  GEORGE PEABODY COLLEGE FOR TEACHERS 
IN THE LIFE OF THE NATION 
  
HON. JAMES B. ASWELL 
Congressman from Louisiana 
  
Note.—Printed in the Congressional Record by request of Hon. Joseph W. 
Byrns, of Tennessee, February 18, 1925, as indicated by the following extract. 
Mr. Byrns, of Tennessee: Mr. Speaker, the fiftieth anniversary of George Pea- 
body College for Teachers, which is located at Nashville, Tenn., is being celebrated 
this week. Many distinguished persons and prominent speakers are in attend- 
ance, among them our colleague, Hon. James B. Aswell, of Louisiana. Dr. Aswell 
is an honored alumnus of the institution, and for years was a member and vice 
president of the Board of Trustees, having resigned that position because his du- 
ties in Congress prevented his attendance on its meetings. He delivered to-day a 
most excellent address on the occasion of this anniversary celebration, one which 
can be read with pleasure and profit by every one. The address is as follows: 
In keeping with Mr. Peabody’s high purpose and great wisdom, 
Peabody College was wisely located. Nashville, for more than fifty 
years the Mecca of thousands of students annually attracted here seek- 
ing the advantages offered by special kinds of college and university 
training, is the educational center, the recognized “Athens of the 
South.” Peabody College is fortunately located. During fifty years 
the college has grown stronger, and day by day it will grow stronger 
still, by being in Nashville and by having a share in the varied edu- 
cational enterprises centered here. Nashville is, indeed, a city of 
light “set upon a hill.”” Peabody College for Teachers shines in this 
light as the Harvard of the South. 
The primary purpose of the Peabody: Fund was to organize and 
develop schools and school systems in towns, cities, and counties. The 
Peabody men and women who have gone out from this institution as 
teachers, principals, superintendents, and presidents of colleges and 
universities, recognizing that the need of the hour was for leadership, 
have been and are crusaders of a high order. With zeal and success, 
from the Potomac to the Rio Grande, from the Atlantic to the western 
boundaries of Texas and Oklahoma, and on to the Pacific Coast, basing 
their energies on morality and universal intelligence, they have been 
powerful factors in educating and in bringing the impoverished South 
once again to the level of the finest and best in our national life. In 
his second letter written to the trustees of the Peabody Education 
Fund, in 1869, the turbulent hour of the reconstruction period, Mr. 
Peabody said: “I do this with the earnest hope and in the sincere trust
-P-A-G-E-68

that, with God’s blessing upon the gift, it may prove a permanent and 
lasting boon, not only to the Southern states, but to the whole of our 
dear country, which I have ever loved so well.” 
The South, the country, and the world are uplifted and blessed be- 
cause Mr. Peabody, the outstanding peacemaker and builder of friend- 
ships, had the vision, knew the science, and used the art of giving 
helpfully. He knew and meant to say that helping the South to edu- 
cate itself would be the surest way of uniting all sections of our coun- 
mon country and building a nation great and strong enough to endure. 
In discussing the subject assigned me, I shall present: (1) the Pea- 
body name, (2) the Peabody spirit, (3) Peabody achievements. 
THE PEABODY NAME 
The “Peabody” name represents a citizen of the world, a friend and 
lover of mankind, who possessed unusual charm of manner—a world 
character who saw far beyond his time. With prophetic vision and 
devotion to humanity, he was the pioneer, the leader of giving in a 
manner worth while in America and the world. His wise giving was 
the inspiration of Slater, Carnegie, Sage, Jeanes, Rockefeller, and all 
the other later philanthropists. He represented a new conception of 
serviceable giving. He unconsciously inspired and directed multi- 
plied millions into new channels of service. He set the pace and led 
the way in helping men help themselves by giving them a vision of 
their own opportunities. He expressed the highest thought and no- 
blest sentiment of giving, raising it to the exalted rank of privilege 
and duty. 
The name “George Peabody” is dynamic, because it suggests flaw- 
less philanthropy. The name is potent to-day, not so much because 
George Peabody’s was the first and greatest fortune of his time, not 
because he received honors and applause like that accorded conquerors 
and kings, not because of his international power, not because at his 
death he was honored in England by Queen Victoria with a place of 
state in Westminster Abbey and a warship to convoy his remains to 
his native land for burial, and not because the United States Govern- 
ment dispatched a warship to act as escort and the Congress decreed 
honors to his name for his philanthropies—not because of these, but 
because of the spirit of his generosity, his wisdom and sympathy, and 
his breadth of friendliness and helpfulness. 
It was an unusual and rare quality which prompted Mr. Peabody 
to make his gift to the South when-and as he did. He was from New 
England, had long been a resident in London, and yet he had the heart 
to feel and the intelligence to envisage the most important thing that

could be done for his native country. He saw that the place which 
needed help and hope was the desolate and devastated South. He saw 
that the rest of the country would go forward in prosperity and edu- 
cation, intelligence, and efficient culture, whereas the South would lag 
behind unless promptly and liberally assisted. He chose to exert the 
benevolence of his friendly spirit and the power of his money to pre- 
vent the calamity of letting one part of our country grow prosperous 
and educated while the other part would be doomed to an endless 
struggle of poverty recovering from the ravages of a civil war. He 
saw that this condition could no more make a united country than the 
situation which made Lincoln declare that our country could not pros- 
per, could not even exist, one-half free and one-half slave. Mr. Lin- 
coln, the exemplar of our country’s magnanimity and the preserver of 
our eternal unity, sought and secured the physical freedom of a race; 
while Mr. Peabody, knowing no bounds of sections or of continents, 
sought and is securing the intellectual freedom of all his countrymen. 
The greatness of the name is further enhanced when we know that 
Mr. Peabody’s conception came from his own inner purpose and not 
from outside or chance suggestion. He was seemingly remote from 
the South. He was seemingly aloof from the United States. There 
seems to be no evidence that this momentous decision of his was occa- 
sioned by any outside incident or connection. No one person and no 
concrete event suggested this act to his magnificent vision. Surely 
this act of patriotism, with its sequence of philanthropy, must be 
ranked as an inspiration from on high and raises George Peabody 
among the supreme lovers of mankind, one whom patriots and educa- 
tors should canonize. 
His gifts to the poor of London, his gifts to his native town in 
Massachusetts and neighboring towns, his gifts to institutions of 
learning, and his statements of the purposes underlying these gifts, 
entitle him to rank in educational doctrine not only with thinkers and 
theorists, like Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Seneca, Quintilian, Comenius, 
and the other great philanthropists, but to be placed alone in his prac- 
tical wisdom of making a gift so as to realize his ideal. It has often 
been said, and must be accepted as literally true in the light of the 
experience of the fifty years of Peabody College, that that $2,000,000 
which he gave for Southern education has achieved more and has more 
practical significance than many times that amount of money given 
anywhere else or for any other purpose in the world. 
The name “‘Peabody,” therefore, is the richest heritage that Peabody 
College could have, well-nigh flawless, pure, and undefiled; wise, ten- 
der, and unfailing. The name is our inspiration to greater endeavor.  
-P-A-G-E-72
66 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
It has been spread by the influence of Peabody College and its grad- 
uates and students to the ends of the earth, always, we hope, unsullied, 
a symbol of service and helpfulness. 
The name of “Peabody” is especially a priceless heritage recognized 
gratefully by the direct recipients of Mr. Peabody’s bounty and the 
benediction of his good will, but throughout the country his name is 
acclaimed as the symbol of wise philanthropy and matchless gener- 
osity. 
THE PEABODY SPIRIT 
The way in which Mr. Peabody gave accounts for the results effected 
by his munificence. President Gilman, of Johns Hopkins University, 
said in 1895: “Every year unfolds the excellence of the plans which 
received the sanction of George Peabody and shared his bounty.” 
Others have noticed the wisdom that was exercised in drawing up the 
instructions under which the trusts were administered. 
Mr. Peabody had a philosophy of giving as well as an impulse to 
give. In 1852, when he was invited to the centennial celebration of 
his native town, he was unable to be present, but sent a gift of grati- 
tude, and with it, inclosed in a sealed envelope, a toast for the occa- 
sion. When the seal was broken, the letter was found to contain these 
words: “A sentiment from George Peabody, of London: Education, 
a debt due from present to future generations.” 
The first element in his giving was a feeling for the solidarity of 
the human groups that make up society, a feeling that the poorest and 
the meanest jeopardize the best, and that the best should improve the 
worst. 
Later, when he gave $2,000,000 to the poor of London, he again 
enunciated his doctrine. “It is my desire,” he said, “not so much to 
relieve poverty as it is to prevent poverty and make it impossible.” 
His influence shines out as clear in this instance as his sympathy was 
broad and quick. He would not have us constantly forced to use the 
surgeon of drastic laws on the sore spots of the race, but he would 
wisely use the processes of preventive remedies. He would insure 
happiness by diminishing tears, sorrow, and want at the source. 
But the crowning instance of his philanthropy is the gift to the 
South, made in 1867 and 1869. This gift of $2,000,000 is unique in 
that Mr. Peabody gave it right on the heels of the Civil War, when 
the people of his section were enemies to the South and the people 
of the South were enemies to his people. The two sections had 
but a moment before been struggling to annihilate each other. Look- 
ing far out over the strife. Mr. Peabody saw the entire nation, and in
-P-A-G-E-73
  
First Day,—Aswell 67 
making this gift said: “I give this to the suffering South for the good 
of the whole nation.” This one time, at least, did a human being on 
this earth reach the height of obeying the injunction, “Love your ene- 
mies.” 
Not in vain did Mr. Peabody wish for the spread of his influence to 
the life of the whole nation. This gift to the South has exerted an 
uninterrupted influence since 1867, when the trustees of the education 
fund began their work which brought into life our entire system of 
public education in the South, starting that movement which is now 
so_tremendous in its sweep. 
More and more Mr. Peabody became dominant in Peabody College, 
which since 1875 has been the central agency for the Peabody Foun- 
dation and the chief exponent of the Peabody spirit. / From this has 
come the establishment of over forty state normal schools, of which 
Peabody College can rightfully be called the mother and the model. 
The department of education or teachers college in each Southern state 
university flows also from this central teachers college and the work 
of the Peabody Education Fund. With the permanent endowment of 
Peabody College in 1909 and the large increase in assets through gifts 
since that time, Peabody College will be more and more able to spread 
abroad the Peabody spirit. The college has ever remained true to 
that spirit, has ever followed the ideals of Mr. Peabody’s benefactions, 
and has ever kept the faith to render full service to education through 
the teachers and the schools. The Peabody spirit, which we hope does 
and shall ever run strong on this campus and in this institution, will 
be found wherever those who have been in residence here may go. 
With this spirit embodied in the teachers sent out from Peabody, we 
shall hope for an unending reproduction of the gentle, wise, high spirit 
of George Peabody. His gifts are talked of everywhere. They are 
concentrated in the South and are visible concretely here in George 
Peabody College for Teachers. The best possible wish for the South 
and for the nation is that the spirit of his life may be embodied in the 
lives of innumerable boys and girls taught in the schools throughout 
all the breadth of our land. 
Mr. Peabody was a prophet in pointing out the great medium of 
philanthropy when he said: “Education, a debt due from present to 
future generations.” He graphically presented a subject which has 
come to occupy more thought than any other. Education ranks as 
a great enterprise from the business standpoint; it ranks as a great 
hope along with religion; it ranks among the processes of improve- 
ment along with the home and the discoveries of science. Not only 
is education thus recognized in this country, but it has become a world-
-P-A-G-E-74
68 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
wide enterprise of the first rank. Lance G. E. Jones, of Oxford, 
England, recently said: 
“Among the movements which the future historian of social devel- 
opments in England will find it necessary to record as characteristic 
of the first quarter of the twentieth century will be a steadily increas- 
ing interest in all that concerns the education of the people. Prob- 
ably at no time has this interest been so widespread as it is to-day. 
The signs of it are everywhere. The demand for admission to sec- 
ondary schools, publicity in the press and on the platform, questions 
in the House of Commons, the interest of taxpayers in the proceedings 
of local education authorities, and even of villagers in village schools, 
alike are indicative of the larger place that problems of education, 
national and local, are gradually filling in men’s minds. Nor is the 
change merely the fruit of renewed zeal on the part of enthusiasts 
or the urgent demands of economists; rather, it is a natural conse- 
quence of the gradual expansion of that system of popular education 
of which the foundations were laid barely a century ago. No one who 
pays other than lip service to the welfare of his country can fail to 
welcome the change, for in this new and widespread interest lies the 
surest hope of the future. . . . Indeed, we would suggest that the 
great need of the moment is knowledge.” 
What has been dimly hoped by educational prophets and seers of 
the past was incarnated and made practical by George Peabody, and 
Peabody College put it into the schools, and, therefore, into the life of 
the nation. Froebel said: “The problem of the world is an educa- 
tional one.” That was a statement then accepted by a few choice 
spirits like him; now it is the slogan even of remote communities. 
The spiritual aspects of education are realized more and more. 
These spiritual values are centered in the teachers far more than in 
the organization and administration of the schools. The wide recog- 
nition of this fact would please the hearts of high thinkers from Pes- 
talozzi and Froebel down to the educational leaders of the present 
time. 
Sir Graham Balfour said: “The immediate administration of offi- 
cials is simply the work of shouldering the burden of the teachers. 
Teachers should be set free to educate with as few hindrances as pos- 
sible. Education is for the pupils first and last; all the rest of us are 
their servants.” 
In somewhat the same way M. Guizot said in 1833 before the French 
Chamber of Deputies: “All the provisions hitherto described would 
be of no effect if we took no pains to procure for the public school thus 
constituted an able master of the high vocation of instructing the peo-
-P-A-G-E-75
First Day,—Aswell 69 
ple. It cannot be too often repeated that it is the master that makes 
the school.” 
Victor Hugo gives the scheme of values for the different stages of 
mankind in terms of suffering and wretchedness. He reminds us that 
if we have seen the misery of men, we know nothing until we have 
seen the misery of women; and if we have seen the misery of women, 
we know nothing until we have seen the misery of children. In the 
progress of education the time has come to state the case positively. 
We should say that when we value the power of men, we have not 
reached the best until we have come to value the influence of women; 
and when we have come to value the influence of women, we still have 
not reached the best until we have clearly seen the unending possibili- 
ties of children. 
It is to this conception that the spirit embodied in George Peabody 
College for Teachers has led. No greater service than this high con- 
ception of education and the clear vision of the supreme human enter- 
prise can be rendered to these United States. 
PEABODY ACHIEVEMENTS 
Peabody College, in its fifty years of existence, has participated with 
enthusiasm and effectiveness in the marvelous growth of education in 
the United States. This influence has been exerted most powerfully, 
as was natural, in the Southern states; but Peabody College has 
worked for the whole country and has been at the forefront in educa- 
tional leadership. 
(In 1875 the enrollment in the public schools of the country was 
8,761,259 pupils; to-day the enrollment is 23,239,227. In 1875 the 
sum invested in the public schools was $82,532,954; in 1922 it was 
$1,580,671,296. This enormous number of children actively at work 
in the schools, taught by 729,426 teachers, forms a big enterprise, no 
matter whether considered from the vast sums of money invested or 
from the still vaster human interests involved. In that same period— 
since Peabody College was founded—the growth of national popula- 
tion has expanded from about 39,000,000 to about 110,000,000. / 
In the South the enrollment in public schools has increased even 
more rapidly than in the rest of the country, whereas our population 
has not increased quite so rapidly. This achievement of the Southern 
states is all the more marvelous when it is remembered that only in 
the last decade have these states acquired the same relative wealth 
and prosperity that was theirs before the Civil War began, in 1861. 
An enlightened body of trained teachers has contributed very 
greatly to this improvement in our Southern schools. The influence 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  70 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
of Peabody in supplying the heads of normal schools, members of their 
faculties, leaders in public education, and teachers for the schools 
was special and direct. In the early pioneering days, from 1875 to 
1890, there seemed to be insuperable obstacles to be overcome. Pov- 
erty and ignorance seemed impenetrable, but the leadership of Peabody 
began to tell and the persistence of her message and influence began 
to take effect. From 1890 to 1900 state normal schools were estab- 
lished in all the Southern states, and a new era of expansion and hope- 
fulness gave the public schools a tremendous impetus. It was then 
that the training of teachers in the South moved forward with the rest 
of the country and has since kept pace with the national progress. 
In those early days the idea of universal education met with special 
opposition in the Southern states. Even more opposition was felt 
and expressed for the idea of special training of teachers and for 
adequate support and salaries for an improved teaching profession in 
the whole country. From about 1860 to 1890 the private normal 
schools, many of them with education fakers at their heads, brought 
the word “normal” into national disrepute. 
The effect of Peabody, believing that “teaching is the noblest of 
professions, but the sorriest of trades,’ was to reduce the number of 
private and gainful normal schools and to elevate the state normal 
schools for the proper training of public-school teachers and leaders. 
The power of example is well illustrated in the influence of Peabody 
College participating in the growth of teacher training in the United 
States.’ When Peabody opened her doors in 1875, there was not a 
single public normal school in the South. To-day there are seventy- 
two state normal schools and colleges, with 54,055 students in at- 
tendance. In 1875 there were 34,220 students enrolled in the normal 
schools of the United States, and in 1922 there were 232,144. 
Peabody College was established in 1875 as a central institution for 
the higher training of teachers, a “West Point” to turn out officers for 
the great army of teachers. It was the power of example—this model 
for those believing in the training of teachers—that spread so power- 
fully in the nineties over all the South and now goes triumphantly 
marching through all parts of the country. 
In growth from a small beginning to its present large aspects, Pea- 
body College has kept ahead as the leader in the training of teachers 
in the South. From 60 students in 1875 it grew to over 600 students 
by 1900, and now enrolls over 3,000 students in the four quarters of 
the calendar year. It has blazed many trails and been looked to with 
confidence as a safe and energetic guide in its special field. In 1892, 
when North Carolina was establishing its Normal College for Women
-P-A-G-E-77
  
First Day,—Aswell 71 
at Greensboro, the distinguished president-elect, Dr. Charles D. Mc- 
Iver, came to Peabody and spent a week studying the workings and 
ideals, which he transplanted to his own new institution. History 
has been repeated again and again. Throughout the South, even 
when many of the normal schools and teachers colleges had grown to 
greater numerical strength and larger income than Peabody was 
blessed with, none the less they still regarded Peabody as leader, not 
merely because of greater age, greater experience, and unfailing devo- 
tion to the cause of teacher training, but because Peabody had never 
failed in sanity nor in progressiveness nor in promoting the profes- 
sion of teaching.’ The visit of the Sadler Commission on British Ed- 
ucation, which came to Peabody in 1903, showed again great confi- 
dence in the Peabody ideals and achievement. Those who were the 
advisers of the Sadler Commission directed them to study Peabody as 
one of the national leaders in the training of teachers. Peabody is the 
center, the head, and front of the new organization, now some five 
years old, the Southern Association of Teacher-Training Institutions.) 
This career of service and achievement has met with recognition for 
Peabody in its own territory and throughout the country. The sacri- 
fices and struggles of the early days, the wisdom and patience of those 
who founded and those who have guided its destinies, are fully justi- 
fied in the position of trusting confidence in which Peabody finds itself 
to-day. 
Among all the changes through which Peabody College has gone in 
a very complex and checkered career, it has never allowed itself to lose 
its hope or to forget its mission. It has not been reluctant to change, 
nor has it been afraid to take the next step in progress. It had to 
begin simply because its environment was without means and haunted 
by uncertainty. But the Peabody courage was never daunted. It 
looked straight down the long vista, but did not fail to see the actual 
conditions on both sides of that long journey to the distant goal. With 
progress in the South, Peabody was quick to take the next step, to 
enlarge its resources by deserving them; and the new era, beginning 
about 1890, saw a large increase of students as the result. Before 
that time the enrollment had never reached 200, but almost suddenly 
the enrollment reached nearly 400, as a symptom of the new feeling 
and the new hope and the new start toward better things. With the 
marvelous renaissance of education throughout the prospering South 
about 1900, Peabody faced the most desperate crisis in her existence. 
Conservative forces prevented the institution from stepping forward 
to meet the new needs and render the larger service for which it was 
longing and striving; but her face had always been to the future, and
-P-A-G-E-78
2 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
it was still fixed in that direction. Under these trying conditions, 
when she demanded to be free and allowed to render larger service to 
meet larger demands, she kept persistently at her post until by 1909 
confidence in her leadership again returned and new resources were 
poured into her lap, and the last great epoch opened up before her 
with the new possibilities after which she had so yearned. Con- 
sciousness of her mission enabled her to achieve this permanency and 
assume this new responsibility. The will to serve made it possible 
for her to have again the privilege of serving. 
Looking backward over the fifty years of Peabody College, we can, 
without boasting, point proudly and affectionately to the value of the 
“Peabody” name. With gratitude we bow in recognition of the gift 
of the Peabody spirit which has purified our ambitions and strength- 
ened our courage. With pride we note the achievements and progress 
of this institution from its infant beginnings to its giant strides. We 
reflect that for thirty-five years, with meager resources, Peabody Col- 
lege accomplished wonders in progress and influence. We rejoice to 
see the enlarging sphere of service and influence which Peabody has 
been permitted to wield. The college has been trusted now with more 
adequate resources and can hope for approval and confidence by rea- 
son of service rendered. For the future Peabody College asks the 
privilege of being permitted and enabled to meet the ever-increasing 
demands upon education. 
Peabody will go forward, still true to her mission, still true to the 
teacher and the child, hoping that the time is not far off when 
philanthropy will seize its greatest opportunity by establishing some 
great fund for the benefit of teachers, comparable with those which 
have been established for medicine, science, art, and the other noble 
objects of thought and life. The teacher stands central among all these 
objects, and Peabody College will exalt the teacher. In every rural 
community, village, town, city, and state the vital need of the time is 
for capable, consecrated leadership—for prepared teachers big enough 
and wise enough and spiritual enough to lead in every worthy com- 
munity endeavor. In the preparation and the inspiration of such 
leaders Peabody College is finding her highest expression and fulfill- 
ing her noblest mission in the life of the nation.

  SERMON AT VESPERS 
  
G. CAMPBELL MORGAN 
Pastor of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, New York City 
  
My DEAR FRIENDS: 
I have no desire to do any other than deliver a message at the Vesper 
hour—that is, to preach—and yet I must break in and say one word 
of a personal nature. I want to express my great indebtedness at 
being able to be here, if only for a brief hour, in the midst of these 
wonderful celebrations. I do not feel that there was any need to 
bring me here from the standpoint that I am an Englishman, seeing 
that you have the most distinguished Englishman in America now 
visiting you and speaking to you this morning—our Ambassador. 
And yet I am glad to be here, because for one year in the city of Lon- 
don the Peabody buildings were in my parish, and there was no room 
in which my workers did not pass in their religious and educational 
work. And so yet I feel that I have something to do with the memory 
of that great man, one of the most significant assets to education in 
the past century. Forgive these few words. 
You will find my text this evening in the book of prophets—Zech- 
ariah, chapter 8, verse 5: “And the streets of the city shall be full of 
boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.” So reads verse 5 in 
chapter 8 of the book of the prophet. ‘And the streets of the city 
shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.” 
If I may borrow the language of Shakespeare and John Bunyan, I 
would like to say that if we should happen to light on this text in the 
Bible, never having seen it before, I think we should all be a little 
astonished. There is an unexpectedness about it when we find it 
here in the book that lies open upon the desk in front of me to-night. 
And the elements of surprise are these: First of all, it is somewhat 
surprising that the Bible should talk about children playing. I hope 
my enunciation is clear enough for every one to hear distinctly. I 
didn’t read “praying;” I read “playing.” That is a sort of astonish- 
ing thing—to find anything in the Bible about children playing. And 
the next element of surprise is that the Bible says the boys and girls 
are to play together. That is the most astonishing thing, and I sup- 
pose constitutes the final astonishment to the people of the Victorian 
Era (to which I belong and am thankful). The most astonishing 
thing about it is that the boys and girls are playing in the streets; and
-P-A-G-E-80
  74 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
so surprise after surprise breaks upon the imaginative mind as the 
text is read. 
“The streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the 
streets thereof.” Nevertheless, this verse is one of the focal points 
of light in the Bible. Here in this verse you are introduced anew to 
the elemental forces of humanity, boys and girls. Here in this verse 
you have suggested to you the ultimate realization, a city. Your 
whole Biblical literature in the form in which you are familiar with 
it, in the form in which it lies here, opens with a garden and closes 
with a city; and the Biblical literature is an illustration of the move- 
ment of man from the garden and the home of the child to the city of 
God. 
Boys and girls, the stuff of which the ultimate order in this world— 
that is, with the will of God and the full realization of human blessed- 
ness—is to be made; boys and girls. Boys and girls playing in the 
streets of the city. The passion of the city is inherent in human na- 
ture. A divine passion, a divine ideal, for humanity is not back of 
the individual; neither is it back of an aggregation of individuals; 
it is that of an order, a social and related order, in which all share 
in the well-being of each and each contributes to the well-being of all; 
and of all this, the city is the ultimate realization. 
“The streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the 
streets thereof.” This was the vision of the seers, those rough and 
rugged old Hebrew prophets, who, looking down through the smoke 
and the mirk and the misery that surrounded them and living among 
the exhalations of sin whose causes they were sent to denounce, as 
they made their upward way through the ages, saw the final glory, 
the accomplishment of a divine purpose, the realization of the high- 
est and best in human history; and as they looked, they saw the city 
of God. Zechariah, this prophet who exercised the ministry in the 
days of breakdown and degeneracy, in association with another 
prophet whose ministry was yet briefer, calling upon the people to 
arise and build the house of God as the true center of national life, 
climbed the heights, and, looking on, he saw the city of God, the ulti- 
mate realization of the divine ideal; and, looking on to that city, he 
said: “The streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing 
in the streets thereof.” 
Now, it seems to me that there can be no verse in all the Bible that 
is more worth consideration on the part of those whose great work in 
life is that of dealing with the child, and whose ultimate goal in all 
their endeavor, if they rightly apprehend it, is the building of the 
city of God and the building up of the true order of life. Nine years

ago, on February 18, the president of this institution, in an address, 
spoke of it in these words. He told those who heard him they were 
divinely called to engage in the business of preparing citizens for the 
uncertain, vague to-morrow. And then he referred to those who 
would be in the hands of those to whom he spoke—“those pliable youths 
who will be in your hands and whom it will be your privilege to direct.” 
Dr. Payne nine years ago wrote me this text. I was uncertain as to 
what to say here to-night, but there you have it—children, the pliable 
stuff out of which to mold the citizens of to-morrow. I ask you, then, 
for a few moments to look on, not dreamingly, to the city, but to have 
it in your thought, the final victory. You and I probably will not be 
here when that victory comes. It will come in spite of all the difficul- 
ties of the hour, in spite of all the discouragements that often distress 
us. God’s victory is assured ; the victory will come. 
The victory will come. We may not be here to see it, but we can 
hasten its coming and contribute to that coming in proportion as we 
have a clear vision of it, a clear understanding of the responsibilities 
that rest upon us to-day. 
Here, then, in this word of the old prophet two things arrest me— 
first, its revelation of God’s ideal for the child; and, secondly, its reve- 
lation of God’s ideal for the city. What is the revelation of this pro- 
phetic word as to God’s ideal for the child? Now, hear me, and hear 
methrough. The ideal for the child is that the child shall play. “The 
streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets 
thereof.” What is his ideal for the city? It is implicit in the dec- 
laration. The city of God is to be a city in which the streets are fit 
for children to play in. Again, the city of Ged is a city in which chil- 
dren are to be fit to play in the streets. God’s ideal for the child— 
what is it? That the child shall play. Nobody here will misinter- 
pret that; but I am going to ask you to consider it, and we are not to 
whittle the word down and make it mean any less than it does mean. 
The child shall play. That is the divine ideal. Now, let me ask a 
very simple question and try to answer it with you to-night. What 
is play? My first answer is this: Play is work; and if any of you 
wise-looking men don’t think so, spend all day to-morrow with your 
three or four-year-old boy or girl, and do all that they do, and you 
will be more tired than after a hard day of teaching or anything else. 
Play is the output of effort. But what is play? In these days we 
have come to put it in sharp contradistinction from work. Play and 
work—work and play. I affirm that play is work, and yet there is a 
difference between what we mean by play and what we mean by work. 
What, then, is play? Play is work which is a response to an inward
-P-A-G-E-82
76 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
desire. Play is response to an inward desire without any thought of 
profit resulting from such response. You set a child of three to play. 
What will it do? It will play out of its own inward desire, and won’t 
expect to be paid for doing it. That is—as Kipling would say, “that 
is another story ;” but we won’t follow it now. The child plays with 
no hope of profit—plays out of its own inward desire—and, in doing 
so, develops and expresses its individuality. 
What is play? Play is not only effort in response to inward desire; 
it is effort in response to outward influence playing in upon it. A 
child is imitative in its play; and in proportion as it does that, the 
child is developing personality. I don’t want any squabble with my 
psychologist friends here. What is the difference between individ- 
uality and personality? I don’t know what their definition is, but I 
know what I mean by each term. You may follow me. Individual- 
ity—I am using the word to represent the ego—myself—that which 
you never have seen and never will see—that deep, strange being that 
Iam. Personality is what is manifest—that which has to do with 
interrelationships. You know something of my personality; I might 
know something of yours. That is what I mean. Whether it is well 
taken or no, I don’t care; it serves my purpose. The child first of all 
answers its own inward desire; and if you will set a child free to play, 
you will discover what its own powers really are. I think even in 
these academic halls I will be free enough to make a personal illus- 
tration. Long before I was eight years old I preached regularly to 
my sister’s dolls. My sister and her dolls came regularly to hear me 
preach. Poor sister and poor dolls! But, still—and I am making no 
apology for the personal illustration—I played at preaching, and I’m 
doing it yet. It is the biggest fun of my life to preach. I had rather 
preach than anything else. I know there is an application to be made 
of what I say, but there is nothing intended and you won’t make it. 
I remember thirty years ago, in a certain city of England, a lad 
coming into the room in which I was sitting—we had become great 
friends—and, climbing upon my chair, said: “I have got it.” I said: 
“What have you got?” He showed mea book. “I have been saving 
up my ha’pennies to get it.” I can’t tell you what a “ha’pence” is; but, 
still—‘“‘and I got twelve, and I got it.” Sixpence spent on what? 
What do you suppose? He had got a little book called “Pilter’s First 
Principles of Physiology.” A boy nine years old saving up to buy 
“Pilter’s First Principles of Physiology!’ To-day that boy is His 
Majesty’s chief medical officer in the city of Calcutta. He was playing 
his way into his work. Play is the expression of inward desire, which 
comes out of inward capacity. But it is also imitative. It responds  
-P-A-G-E-83
  First Day,—Morgan 17 
to that which is outside. A boy is almost sure to play at his father’s 
work if he and his father are really friends. That is imitative. 
He will forget that an inward passion will be mightier than this re- 
spect for the outer. He is playing in answer to inward desire and in 
answer to outward influence brought to bear upon him. 
“The streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing’— 
doing that which develops the thing that lies within them, responding 
to the influences that are playing in upon them, and by the double 
process preparing themselves for their true work in life and for their 
place in the community. If the text surprises you, and it may do so, 
you go back to your Old Testament, and everywhere the child is 
named it shall play. God’s ideal for the child is that it shall play. 
We are a great deal too fussy about this business to-day—trying to 
teach children to play. The proper thing to do is to set them free to 
play. There are some mothers here; you will understand me. Your 
girlie holds in far greater love and reverence the rag doll she made 
than the expensive French thing you bought for her in your folly 
last Christmas. She played her way. The divine ideal for the child 
is that it shall play. 0, let this simple expression help you to look at 
the city of God! In the streets of the city of God they shall play. 
What will they play at in the city of God in that final order? I 
don’t know fully, but sometimes a negation is in order. I will tell 
you what they won’t play. They won’t play at soldiers. They may 
for a little while, after the city is just built, play at blacksmith shop, 
because they have seen men in those early days turn destructive 
things into constructive weapons, swords into plowshares. And the 
great function of the teacher is to give them that opportunity. “O, 
but,” somebody says, “that isn’t what we are after.” I think it is. 
If you will think again, I think it is. 
And notice that there are boys and girls playing—coeducation. 
Please notice that. The playing child—so that everything that is a 
task ceases to be a task. O, that is very well for the little one in the 
kindergarten! Well, keep that name if you likeit. It is a fine name. 
When you translate it, it is more beautiful. Remember, the princi- 
ple that you have got there has to be carried through. 
“The streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the 
streets thereof.” Turn it around. I leave it there, not finally devel- 
oped, only a suggested line of thought, and turn your eye. “The 
city, its streets fit for the children to play in.” Now, I am certain I 
can best serve you by not staying with that, but leaving it as a 
thought, provocative, inspirational, and mighty, if it once grasps you. 
There are those here to-night who are not in the teaching profession,
-P-A-G-E-84
  718 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
but you are the friend of the teacher. Business men and those asso- 
ciated with civic life, I pray you remember that you are also respon- 
sible for the children, and there is part of your responsibility. If 
the teachers are laying hands upon this plastic material, the stock 
out of which God will bring his final victory into the world, the boys 
and girls, they are looking to you to see to it that the principles upon 
which the civic life is based are principles that will eventuate in 
streets fit for children to play in—a city in which nothing is per- 
mitted that can harm a child, a city where nothing is permitted that 
shall harm the life of a little child either physically or mentally, a 
city in which no amusements are tolerated, the very placards an- 
nouncing which may seduce the clear eyes of youth from everything 
high and noble and beautiful. The streets of the city fit for boys and 
girls to play in—that is the ultimate ideal. But, now, what else? 
Children fit to play in the streets—ah, that is the goal, that is the 
aim, that is to be the master passion of fathers and mothers and teach- 
ers. There are children that are not fit to play in the streets. O, I 
don’t mean obscene children in the ordinary sense of the word; but 
children proud, despotic, and cruel. They pollute the streets and they 
are not all found in London (let me go home for an illustration), in the 
East End; they are found in the West End. And these children are 
not all children resulting from a parentage that had connection with a 
penitentiary; they are also children resulting of a parenthood that 
have had connection with the university. The great ideal is to make 
that child a child that, in its freedom, in its love, in its truth, in its 
beauty, shall go out to bless and not to blast. Children fit to play in 
the streets. Here is part of the great and holy task and calling of the 
teacher—communication of knowledge, but the communication of 
wisdom also. Here again, whether warranted or no, I make a distinc- 
tion between knowledge and wisdom. Knowledge is just knowing 
things; wisdom is knowing the value of the things known and know- 
ing how to use the things known, and there can be no wisdom that is 
high and full and final that neglects the deep spiritual and moral 
things in the life of the child. 
[Here a black cat crosses the platform.] No, never mind that dear 
cat. I love a cat. It is more pleasant to look at a cat than me, I 
know; but I don’t like losing your eyes. 
There can be no neglect, I must say, of that which is spiritual and 
moral that will not react unfavorably upon the child, as presently 
that child passes into the life of the city and the life of the nation. 
Iam not arguing. I should not be foolish enough. Untrue to my own 
experience as a teacher, I am not arguing that the work of the teacher
-P-A-G-E-85
First Day,—Morgan 19 
is to be specifically naming the subject of religion; but I am claiming 
that if the glory of the ultimate social condition in the ultimate city 
of God is not kept burning before the eyes of the teacher, the hand 
of the teacher upon the plastic clay of the child will lose something 
of its strength, something of the power necessary to crush the clay, 
in order that presently it may caress it back into form and beauty. 
It is only those who have these children in their charge, who see 
through to the ultimate, that are able to touch the immediate work as 
it ought to be touched. 
It is a far cry apparently from Zechariah to Jesus, and yet I 
venture to ask you to think once again of words perhaps most of you 
are familiar with as having fallen from the lips of our Lord; and if 
you will put these words by the side of the words of our text this even- 
ing, you will see the movements and the general truth in both of them. 
Said Jesus one day: “Suffer the little children to come unto me, and 
forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.” The streets 
of the city—the kingdom of God; boys and girls—the children. And 
as he looked at those children, whom some of his own disciples would 
have held back from him, it was not merely with tenderness and with 
love, but with indignation, that he said: “Let those children come to 
me.” And I would with all courtesy, but with all urgency, impress 
upon all teachers and upon every institution that has to do with the 
training of the child the supreme and central necessity for seeing 
whereunto this training leads, not merely in the life of the child, but 
in the great movements of God and humanity toward the ultimate— 
the ultimate that seems so long and postponed that at times we are 
almost filled with despair; and yet you who are touching the children 
are touching the reasons of hope, and only as the vision is clear can 
that touch be the true touch. 
What can we do? If we have homes of our own, we can at any rate 
see that the atmosphere of our own home is the very atmosphere of 
the very ultimate city of God. Then the children that pass out of 
these homes into the streets of the city will go out to bless them. 
The home and the school must be in eternal union about this great 
business, and in the home and school alike the immediate must be illu- 
minated by the ultimate—the glory of that last which must come; 
for that cannot end; that glory will shine upon our work. 
And may I say to you the things some of you know so well by expe- 
rience, if only your own eyes have not become dim in the looking? 
The glory of the ultimate is always shining through the eyes of a little 
child. In every child there is faith; in every child there is love; in 
every child there is hope. When I say “faith,” I don’t necessarily 
   
-P-A-G-E-86
80 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
mean faith in God; that is the ultimate—that depends on you; but 
they have faith—they believe in you. No child is born cynical. It 
may learn the evil habit if it lives with some people, but it is not so 
born; it believes. Every child loves. And no argument is needed; 
every child has hope. And those are the elemental things of human 
character and of human life; and when at last God’s great kingdom 
has come and God’s great city is built, it will be the triumph of faith, 
the answer to hope, and the realization of love. And whenever you 
handle a child, you are handling the elemental stock in which these 
forces are found; and it is only as we handle the child right that we 
can do anything to hasten the coming of the city of God. 
I might turn aside to ask you to look at young life to-day every- 
where; and if you do, you will see the proof of all we are thinking, 
both in realization and in failure. And—O!—let us not forget when 
sometimes we are given to criticism and to speaking unkindly of cer- 
tain things that our eyes are seeing in the young to-day. The blame 
is not on the young; it is somewhere behind—on those who have had 
to do with their training and their teaching. That is a subject to be 
discussed more with parents than with teachers. When you have 
children to teach that come out of true homes, your work is all the 
easier. When you have children to teach that have no influences in 
the home that make for character and beauty and glory, your task is 
the more difficult, but it is the more sacred. I utter the plea in the 
midst of these celebrations—a plea that the teachers of to-day shall 
not forget the supreme things that make of the playtime of the child 
the foundation of the building of the city of God.

HISTORICAL EPISODES 
A sort of moving-picture portrayal of scenes in the fifty years of 
George Peabody College for Teachers was presented in over a hundred 
slides, with comment and explanation made by William Ross Bourne, 
A.B. ’05, Ph.D. ’24. 
The pictures were divided into five series. The first series dealt 
largely with George Peabody and the Peabody Education Fund; the 
second series gave pictures of the first home of George Peabody Col- 
lege for Teachers, including scenes of buildings and grounds on the 
former campus at Second Avenue (South Market Street) and Linds- 
ley Avenue; the third series gave pictures of President Stearns, Pres- 
ident William H. Payne, and various class and faculty groups of the 
first quarter century ; the fourth series gave more detailed pictures of 
societies and student organizations, which at the same time exhibited 
many college activities and the costumes of the period; the fifth series 
depicted the new program and the steps by which the remarkable 
progress of the second quarter century of Peabody was made possible, 
including pictures of the new campus and class and faculty groups of 
the present régime. 
Musical numbers were given at the beginning and end of each of the 
five series by the Peabody Ensemble Singers under the direction of 
Professor Gebhart. 
Below is given the text of Dr. Bourne’s comment on three notable 
scenes: 
“1, First meeting of the trustees of the Peabody Education Fund. Ten of 
these sixteen distinguished Americans shown in the picture met on February 8, 
1867, at Willard’s Hotel, Washington, D. C., at 11 A.M. On the preceding day 
they had received the famous letter from Mr. Peabody which forms alike the 
charter of the activities of these trustees and of George Peabody College for 
Teachers. | 
“In the group George Peabody is seated at a table with Hon. Robert C. Win- 
throp, his confidential friend and for twenty-seven years the chairman of the 
trustees (1867 to 1894). General Grant, who had just led the Northern armies 
to victory, stands side by side with Governor Aiken, of South Carolina, whose 
state had been ravished by the relentless Sherman. Behind Mr. Winthrop stands 
the venerable Bishop McIlvaine, of Ohio, by whose prayers the deliberations were 
lifted up into the presence of the Most High for his blessings. / 
“The trustees passed resolutions of grateful appreciation of Mr. Peabody’s 
unprecedented generosity to the city of London and to the institutions in the Mid- 
dle and Eastern states of the Union, and then declared: ‘He has now crowned the 
whole with this last deed of patriotism and loving-kindness, so eminently calcu- 
lated to bind together the several parts of our beloved country in the bonds of 
mutual well-being and regard.’
-P-A-G-E-88
82 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
“It is a very noble gathering. There stand several governors of states both 
North and South; senators of the United States; President Grant, the commander 
in chief of the American Army, who had fought and lost and won again at Appo- 
mattox in the struggle for the preservation of these United States. There was a 
great bishop of the church, who had guided our benefactor in many ways in the 
past. Mr. Winthrop is called to take the chair, and, calm statesman though he is, 
he trembles with profound emotion. Mr. Peabody rises. The bishop is on one 
side of him, while the general of the Grand Army of the Potomac stands on the 
other. After reading his deed of gift to them for the children of the South, there 
is a solemn hush, and then it is proposed that the blessings of Almighty God be 
called upon this solemn act. They kneel there in a circle of prayer, the Puritan 
of New England, the pioneen of the West, the financier of the metropolis, and the 
defeated veteran of the Confederacy. With bended knee and touching elbow, they 
dedicate this great gift. They consecrate themselves to the task of its wise expen- 
diture. In that act and in that moment, not quite two years after Appomattox, is 
the first guaranty of a reunited country.” 
2. The memorable meeting of the trustees of the Peabody Education Fund at 
Washington, January 24, 1905, when it was unanimously voted that $1,000,000 
be appropriated for the endowment of George Peabody College for Teachers, in 
codperation with gifts from Nashville and Tennessee, amounting to an additional 
$750,000. This was the beginning of the building of this new home for the Col- 
lege, where it might be housed in comfort and beauty, to work in the creative en- 
terprise of exemplifying the Peabody spirit: ‘The service of man and the glory of 
God.’ 
“The older members of the Peabody trustees leading in this movement will be 
noticed: Judge Fenner, Governor Porter, Mr. Morgan, Mr. Olney, and Hon. Joseph 
H. Choate, presided over by the venerable Chief Justice of the United States, Hon. 
Melville W. Fuller. The younger members who put new vigor into the develop- 
ment of these beneficent plans were President Roosevelt and Bishop William Law- 
rence. This meeting was as decisive for the development of the College as the 
meeting of 1867 was significant for education in the South.” 
“8. Visit of President Roosevelt to the campus, October 22, 1907. President 
Porter, on the step of the motor car, is pinning the College colors to President 
Roosevelt’s coat, who has risen to address the students and faculty and friends of 
the College there assembled. The ovation was an expression of appreciation for 
the pronounced activity of President Roosevelt in behalf of endowing the College.”

PROCEEDINGS. OF THE SECOND DAY 
  
The second day’s program illustrated the part which Peabody has 
had in stimulating public education through the training of teachers 
and through its leadership in guiding the establishment of normal 
schools and teachers colleges. From Peabody as a center the influ- 
ence has spread in all directions, permeating not only the South, but 
the nation at large. 
The commemoration exercises were impressive enough as the 
Golden Jubilee of Peabody, a particular institution, but not solely or 
even mainly in that limited aspect. They were more truly impres- 
sive as the stupendous triumph of a great ideal. Public education in 
its broadest sweep was the true theme of the great convocation of 
scholars, statesmen, educators, alumni, and public-minded citizens 
assembled at the Peabody Semicentennial Celebration. The direct 
training of teachers for the Southern schools had been begun by 
Peabody in 1875, and every item in the beginnings and growth of the 
public-school system of the South held strong interest. But the dis- 
cussions glanced at the past only to get a correct start on projects 
stretching into the long future. Public education in the South is 
sweeping forward with an irresistible advance. The assembly at 
Peabody was a conference of the men and women who are guiding its 
progress. 
An imposing array of speakers as eminent and as critically acute 
as was ever brought together at such a commemoration discussed the 
fundamentals of civilization involved in the problems of public educa- 
tion, particularly as relating to the South, but equally applicable to 
our whole nation. As an external symbol of these weighty discus- 
sions was the formal procession of delegates in academic garb bring- 
ing felicitations from one hundred and fifty-five sister institutions 
within the United States, and the alumni delegates representing all 
of the classes that have been graduated from George Peabody College 
for Teachers during fifty years. The volume of congratulatory mes- 
sages brought by these delegates added a joyousness to the occasion 
which was still further enhanced by greetings sent from five hundred 
and two other colleges, universities, and learned societies within the 
United States. Ninety-five of the famous foreign institutions of 
learning sent either delegates or messages of greeting and congratu- 
lation. The true theme of this day’s program was: 
George Peabody College for Teachers in the 
life of the South and the Nation.

PRESENTATION OF DELEGATES 
  
H. J. MIKELL 
Bishop of Atlanta 
    
Mr. CHAIRMAN OF vs BoARD OF TRUSTEES AND MR. PRESIDENT OF 
GEORGE PEABODY Col LEGE FOR TEACHERS: 
It is my high privilege to present to you the distinguished represent- 
atives from our sister institutions of learning who have come to felic- 
itate our College upon the occasion of its semicentennial. Because of 
the humanizing influence of true culture there is a feeling of friend- 
ship and brotherhood among institutions of learning. They are all 
engaged in the high task of education; they are all engaged in the hard 
task of trying to eliminate ignorance and prejudice and narrowness; 
and this oneness of purpose and aim gives them a feeling of comrade- 
ship, and they are ready to do honor one to another and to rejoice in 
one another’s good fortune. The famous motto of William of Wyke- 
ham, England’s great friend of learning, “Manners Makyth Man,” 
is still the motto of all true culture. So these distinguished educators 
have come to-day to show their manners—not merely a certain cere- 
monial politeness, but a real friendship for George Peabody College 
and a deep appreciation of the way in which she is fulfilling the vision 
of her founder. And this was the vision of our founder. He says: 
“Looking beyond my span of life, I see our country, united and pros- 
perous, taking a high rank among the nations and becoming richer 
and more powerful than ever before.” 
But if George Peabody could only see a nation becoming rich and 
powerful, then his vision was very sordid and very earth-bound. 
Instead of the seer whose symbol is the soaring eagle, he was the bird 
with a broken wing, which always clings to the earth. But it was 
not so with him. This was not all his vision. Listen to him again: 
“But to make her prosperity more than superficial, her moral and in- 
tellectual development should keep pace with her material growth.” 
Now, the moral and intellectual development of a nation depends upon 
the education of its people—the task to which all these institutions 
represented to-day are dedicated. 
But surely education means not only the training of the intellect, 
not only the making a man’s mind as keen and sharp as was the scim- 
itar of the Sultan Saladin, with which he could sever a silken veil. 
A nation becoming rich and powerful through intellectual develop- 
ment only was not the whole of the vision of our founder. So listen  
-P-A-G-E-91
Second Day,—Mikell 85 
to him once more in his last words to our predecessors, the trustees 
of his gift: “With reverent recognition of the need of the blessing of 
Almighty God upon this gift and with the fervent prayer that under 
his guidance you may be directed to the highest good of our beloved 
country.” 
This, then, was his whole vision: The power and prosperity of this 
nation founded upon its moral and intellectual development, and its 
moral and intellectual development founded on religion. And this, 
I think, would be his definition of religion: Reverent recognition of 
God in a man’s own life, and the going out under his guidance to work 
for the highest good of his fellow men. 
The task of this institution is to make this vision a reality, and only 
this in its wholeness can make our nation really great. Surely we 
have learned this by the history of other nations. We have the exam- 
ple of a nation which trusted in material strength to make it great. 
The Roman said that the greatness of a people consisted in the getting 
of power. So they gave themselves up to a military and civil expan- 
sion. They conquered the world, and the breezes of strange lands 
filled their fluttering banners and the earth trembled under the tread 
of their legions. According to the Roman idea, he was serving the 
world best who rode as Cesar at the head of his legions, or who en- 
tered in triumph into the gates of the capital with a long line of pris- 
oners taken in war, or who exercised power over the affairs of men 
in the senate house or in the rule of distant provinces. And they 
failed. Surely the symbol of the failure of material power to per- 
petuate the greatness of a people is that gigantic Coliseum which the 
Romans built, in which worldly power threw those who trusted in 
spiritual things to be devoured by lions, and which now itself stands 
a roofless ruin, while the spirit of those whose blood once made red 
its sands can never die. 
And we have, too, the story of a nation which trusted in its intel- 
lectual power to make it great. The Greeks gave themselves up to 
mental and physical culture. They made the body beautiful, the 
mind quick and alert, life graceful and elegant and easy. The Greek 
ideal gave the world a beautiful life, erected noble buildings, carved 
perfect statues, and wrote fair philosophies and perfect poems. And 
then it failed. Its happiness degenerated into the pursuit of pleas- 
ure; its moderation, into license; and its beauty, into corruption. 
Surely history car tell us that behind all other greatness must lie 
the spiritual power of a people. And when men gather up the wisdom 
of the ages, and turn over the pages of its history, and gather up the 
riches of its poetry and music and art and make of them a religion
-P-A-G-E-92
86 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
or philosophy of life which leaves out God, from whom all the beauty 
and strength of the earth emanates, they are as mistaken and dull 
and uncomprehending as was that “base Indian who threw a pearl 
away richer than all his tribe.” 
That this institution means to be true to the spirit of its founder 
is set down in stone on lasting pillars in the name which we have 
given to our central building, the “Social-Religious Building.” Its 
permanence and its strength voice for us the ideal of the Roman 
builder; its columned grace and beauty speak to us of the ideal 
which the Greek has bequeathed to the world; and we have filled it 
with the spirit of reverent recognition of God, and we send forth from 
it men and women equipped for the service of their fellow men. And 
because we are trying to be true to the vision of our founder, and be- 
cause of the service which we are rendering to the cause of education, 
and because we are inscribing high in the hearts of our nation the word 
“teacher,” these great teachers present to-day have come to do this 
College honor and to iia the greetings of their great schools. 
ADDRESS OF WELCOME TO DELEGATES   
  
EDWARD T. SANFORD 
Justice of i Supreme Court of the United States 
  
Mr. PRESIDENT, YOUR EXCELLENCY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
Fifty years ago the — to whom George Peabody, of illustri- 
\ous and ever-grateful memory, had intrusted the administration of his 
priceless gift to the cause of Southern education, established in this 
city, in codperation with the historic University of Nashville, a nor- 
mal school for the training of Southern teachers, which later became 
the Peabody Normal College and yet later was merged in the founda- 
tion of George Peabody College for Teachers. 
In behalf of this college for teachers, the inheritor of the name and 
traditions of Peabody College, I salute the scholars and citizens who 
have gathered here to wdveld with us this anniversary of the es- 
tablishment of our College, to bear witness to the mighty work it 
wrought for the teachers and children of the South, and to recount 
the progress of teacher training in these momentous fifty years and 
the vision and promise of the future. 
To our greatly honored guests; to His Excellency, the British Am-
-P-A-G-E-93
Second Day,—Sanford 87 
bassador, the distinguished representative of our mother country, the 
envoy of fellowship and good will between the great English-speaking 
peoples, whose friendship, knit by ties of blood and language, is the 
surest guaranty of the world’s enduring peace and of the preservation 
of the ordered liberties of men; to the men of letters bearing com- 
missions from our sister colleges and institutions of learning, whose 
lives are dedicated, in faithful ministry, to the cause of education, 
who bring to us to-day, in gracious comradeship, the inspiration of 
their presence and the counsels of their wisdom; to the former stu- 
dents and graduates of Peabody, who have come to testify their love 
for her and to pledge anew to her their loyal and devoted service—to 
these and all the friends who have here assembled we give heartfelt 
and most cordial welcome. 
In the hearts of all here present is the same faith in the gospel of 
education, the “beautiful key that gives access to the realities of life;” 
the same belief that education is essential to the higher life of the na- 
tion and the permanency of its institutions of freedom; the same con- 
viction that to make education effective the teacher must be rightly 
trained for the responsibility of his high calling. 
We believe, as did George Peabody, that education is a “debt which 
the present owes to future generations;” and we have hearkened unto 
the admonition of the wise man: “Lay fast hold of instruction; let 
her not go; for she is thy life.’ This is the unswerving faith of 
America—the very bedrock of its security—that the one sure prep- 
aration for the future is the training of its youth, not in the mere 
sharpening of the wits, but in righteousness, in wisdom, and in truth; 
in the strength of an unhesitating courage and in the power of calm- 
ness and self-control; in the standards of life that give it worth and 
beauty, dignity and nobility, and bring abiding happiness; in the firm 
and deep-seated convictions of duty and patriotism that, whatever 
the future may have in store, shall nobly fit them to become true, 
loyal, and courageous citizens of the republic, valiant and faithful in 
time of peace as in time of war. In this alone lies safety; there is no 
other path. 
The sacred responsibility of thus training the children of the nation 
for citizenship rests upon the teacher. Weightier responsibility or 
greater privilege no man could have. But he himself must be fitly 
trained for the right discharge of his noble task. His work is of vital 
importance to the nation. Outside of the home and church, his is the 
strongest and most enduring influence in the life of the child. That 
his supreme mission may be fulfilled, he must be equipped with the 
tools of learning; he must bear in his heart the abiding sense of his
-P-A-G-E-94
  
  88 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
responsibility ; his soul must be aflame with the vision of the enrich- 
ment and betterment of the lives of men. And so it is that we exalt 
and reverence the teacher and the beauty, the dignity, and the holiness 
of his calling; we honor his devoted heroism as he leads the children 
in the battle against ignorance and the powers of darkness; and we 
hold him in an affection granted only to the true and brave leaders of 
the nation’s higher life. 
It is the privilege of every normal school and teachers college to 
supplement the various educational agencies of the republic, and to 
extend to its army of earnest, faithful teachers the highest and best 
training within its power that shall rightly equip them for their 
life’s work, inspire them with the ideals of the true teacher, and send 
them forth to every hamlet, village, and city, and to every school, 
academy, and college, where, in radiating streams of multiplied and 
unending influence, they shall strengthen and ennoble the minds and 
souls of the youth of the land and instill in them the abiding lessons 
of truth and righteousness, of brave and serene devotion to duty, and 
of steadfast character. 
We have assembled here to-day as comrades in the common faith of 
the gospel of education, that “noble and virtuous education” de- 
scribed by John Milton, England’s poet and our poet, whose right 
path is “so green, so full of goodly prospects and melodious sounds 
on every side that the harp of Orpheus was not more charming,” that 
inflames the soul of youth “with the study of learning and the admira- 
tion of virtue, stirred up with high hopes of living to be brave men 
and worthy patriots, dear to God and famous to all.” 
In that common faith I bid you again, one and all, thrice welcome. 
RESPONSE FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION 
  
JOHN W. ABERCROMBIE 
State Superintendent of Education of Alabama 
  
Mr. PRESIDENT: 
I am deeply grateful for the high compliment paid me by the invita- 
tion to participate in the ceremonies of this happy occasion. Deeply 
grateful am I also for the privilege that comes to me as a result of the 
extension of the invitation and its acceptance—namely, the privilege 
of representing here my coworkers in the field of state school admin- 
istration.
-P-A-G-E-95
  Second Day,—Abercrombie 89 
I have the honor to speak for the state superintendents of educa- 
tion of the United States. From them I bring greetings and good 
wishes to the board of trustees, the president and faculty, the alumni 
and students, the patrons and friends of George Peabody College for 
Teachers. Cordial greetings and sincere good wishes I bring. It is 
with no ordinary pleasure that I perform this mission; for a privi- 
lege so delightful, a service so agreeable, an honor so great, has come 
to few men. 
These appropriate and beautiful ceremonies mark the close of a 
half century of conspicuous and glorious achievement. Here for 
fifty years the torch of learning has burned. In consecrated and 
uplifted hands it has been held. Like a beacon it has shone, illumi- 
nating the pathway for thousands of seekers after physical, mental, 
moral, spiritual, and professional growth. 
George Peabody College stands for the ascertainment of truth— 
that truth which appeals to reason and conscience; for the dissemi- 
nation of knowledge—that knowledge which leads to culture and wis- 
dom; for the promotion of religion—that religion which releases from 
bigotry and superstition; for the inculcation of patriotism—that pa- 
triotism which nurtures manhood and freedom; for the development 
of vocational efficiency—that vocational efficiency which makes for 
success and happiness in the chiefest of vocations. For fifty years 
it has stood for these essentials of character, citizenship, and attain- 
ment; for these requisites of professional proficiency, economic devel- 
opment, and social growth. 
The history of the administration of the Peabody Education Fund, 
out of which Peabody College grew, and the history of the develop- 
ment of the public-school systems of the Southern states, are so 
closely related, so completely interwoven, that it is impossible to dis- 
associate them. Indeed, the history of the one is practically coequal 
with that of the other. 
When Mr. Peabody made his philanthropic, generous, magnani- 
mous, and theretofore unparalleled, gift to Southern education, there 
was not and there had never been in any Southern state a system of 
tax-supported, compulsorily attended public schools. When this in- 
stitution was established, there was not and there had never been in 
the whole South a state-supported school or college devoted entirely 
to the training of teachers. With but two or three exceptions, there 
were no so-called “normal schools.” 
Conditions here prior to, during, and immediately following the 
War between the States were not conducive to a development of the 
principle underlying the policy of universal education at governmental
-P-A-G-E-96
90 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
expense. Slavery, secession, war, emancipation, confiscation, and 
reconstruction had retarded its development. Not until after the 
creation of the Peabody Fund and the establishment of this institution 
did that principle take root and grow. 
Through the policies and activities of the trustees of the Peabody 
Fund each of the Southern states has been assisted materially in un- 
dertaking the establishment and maintenance of a tax-supported sys- 
tem of education. Due largely to those policies and activities, each 
now maintains a more or less efficient system, with normal schools and 
teachers colleges forming integral parts; and the time seems to be 
approaching when the professional training of teachers will be looked 
upon generally as one of the most important functions of a school 
system. Already it is so regarded by students of education every- 
where. 
Before the creation of the Peabody Fund and the establishment of 
Peabody College, the old-time form of purely academic training was 
thought to be the only preparation needed by educational workers. 
Under the operation of these two agencies, our people have come more 
and more to realize that teaching is both a science and an art; that 
proficiency in it requires special preparation; that no person is ade- 
quately qualified for it who has not been thoroughly instructed in 
both the theory and the practice. Happily, thanks to influences set 
in motion by this fund and this college, the time seems to be not far 
distant when special preparation will be required of all who are per- 
mitted to serve in our schools, whether public, private, or denomina- 
tional. 
The movement for the professionalizing of teaching should be en- 
couraged in every way possible, because, in the final analysis, “as is 
the teacher, so is the school.” No material equipment, however ex- 
tensive and costly; no arrangement of courses of study, however skill- 
fully and pedagogically formed; no division of schools into grades 
and classes, however carefully and accurately done; no apportionment 
of funds, however wisely made, can take the place of an adequately 
trained corps of instructors. 
Expert supervision, too, is a matter of prime importance in edu- 
cational administration, particularly since few districts, fewer coun- 
ties, and no states are fully supplied with adequately trained teachers. 
While this condition obtains in varying degrees throughout the coun- 
try, it prevails especially in the states of the South. In fact, for 
reasons known to all students of education, which reasons it is not 
necessary for me to mention in this presence, our school systems suf-
-P-A-G-E-97
Second Day,—Abercrombie 91 
fer from almost every point of view in comparison with those of the 
other sections. 
As already suggested, the states of the South have labored under 
most untoward conditions in their efforts to establish and maintain 
school systems. Unless those conditions are kept in mind, no fair 
and accurate appraisal of their educational achievements can be made, 
no worth-while opinion of their educational progress can be formed. 
If those conditions are held in mind and given due consideration, the 
conclusion is inevitable that each Southern state has made and is mak- 
ing marked and commendable progress, and that nowhere else has 
greater progress been made under similar conditions. 
As evidence of the South’s advancement in education, this state- 
ment from Forbes for January 15, 1925, may be quoted: “The South 
is to-day spending almost twice as much on its public schools as the 
whole of the United States spent in 1900. Look at the growth of 
public-school expenditures in the South: 1900, $35,037,600; 1908, 
$65,150,000; 1920, $211,199,000; 1922, $323,067,000.” Considering 
the conditions obtaining, there has been in the whole history of educa- 
tion no greater achievement than that indicated by these figures. 
But for the moral encouragement and financial assistance rendered 
by the Peabody Fund and the widespread and effective services per- 
formed by Peabody College, this rapid and unsurpassed development 
would have been impossible. First the fund, then the fund and the 
College, then the College led in the educational awakening of the South. 
Every phase of our school work has been touched and quickened and 
promoted. In very truth, the fund and the College have been a dual 
blessing beyond compare. 
When the College was established, public education was unpopular 
among our Southern people; now it is popular. Then we had no 
teacher-training institutions; now every Southern state has one or 
more. Then there was no taxation for schools in all the South; 
now every state levies such taxes. Then we had almost no material 
equipment; now we have many school buildings, libraries, laborato- 
ries, and workshops. Then we had no professionally trained teach- 
ers; now we have thousands of them. Then the educational outlook 
was dark and discouraging; now it is bright and inspiring. 
Beginning in 1875 and coming down to the present, George Pea- 
body College has rendered invaluable assistance to the state depart- 
ments of education. The entire South, practically every state in the 
Union, and several foreign countries have felt the touch and influence 
of those who have been trained here. In every field of human en- 
deavor, and especially in the field of education, they have performed  
-P-A-G-E-98
  92 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
able, helpful, and conspicuous service. In war and in peace, in public 
position and in private life, in educational service and in other fields 
of endeavor they have been weighed and found not wanting. 
If all Peabody influences were obliterated, it is difficult to imagine 
what the result would be. Every department of human endeavor— 
home, school, church, business, government—would suffer. But those 
influences will never die. On the contrary, they will continue to ex- 
ist and to extend, to extend like the widening circles on the ruffled 
bosom of a lake; but, unlike the waves of water, they will rise higher 
with each succeeding undulation till every nook and corner of the 
entire country has been stirred and uplifted. 
RESPONSE FOR SOUTHERN TEACHERS COLLEGES 
  
ROBERT HERRING WRIGHT 
President of North Carolina Teachers College 
  
MR. PRESIDENT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
The motto of our college is, “To Serve;” the second motto is, “On 
Time Every Time;” and the slogan is the combination of, ‘To Serve 
On Time Every Time.” 
They wrote that they wanted me to talk to you five minutes, and I 
am perfectly miserable that you have to sit so long. Let’s all stand 
up for a minute. Now sit down. I feel better, thank you. You 
know, I feel a great deal better, because I feel that that was a deed 
which carried with it the spirit of George Peabody. He wanted to be 
helpful to folks, and I saw you needed help. 
The trustees of the Peabody Education Fund, after working for 
eight years trying to help the devastated South in an educational way, 
became sufficiently educated themselves to see that it was absolutely 
necessary to establish a teacher-training institution before we could 
educate our people. You know, the people of the South do not real- 
ize that yet; neither do they of the North nor the East nor the West. 
The other day I heard a physician say to another one: “I am suffer- 
ing with an ingrowing toenail; and if I could find a doctor I could 
trust, I would have him to fix that toe of mine.” I said: “If you 
didn’t think any more of your toe than you do of your child, you 
would ask-me to fix it; I am a college man.” He said: “Wright, I 
believe I see what you are driving at; but it’s my toe, and it hurts me.”
-P-A-G-E-99
Second Day,—Wright, Frasier 93 
We are beginning to awaken to the realization of the fact that we 
must have teachers if we are going to educate our people. The first 
work of Peabody was to send its products directly into the schools. 
There is another mission. We now have teachers colleges and nor- 
mal schools throughout the South; and why should not we build here 
at Peabody a standard normal school, as well as this demonstration 
school, and use that with this demonstration school and the graduate 
school to train teachers to go into these teachers colleges and normal 
schools through the South and teach prospective teachers how to 
teach? At least, Doctor Payne, there is something to think about; and 
with that thought I bring to you and to this college greetings from the 
teachers colleges and normal schools of the South and bid you God- 
speed in the great work you are undertaking. In the words of a 
famous actor: “May you live long and prosper. This one don’t count.” 
RESPONSE FOR WESTERN TEACHERS COLLEGES 
  
GEORGE WILLARD FRASIER 
President of Colorado Teachers College 
  
When I received President Payne’s letter asking me to come to 
Nashville on this occasion and speak for the teacher-training institu- 
tions of the West, I accepted gladly and joyfully. I accepted because 
I never had visited any part of the South, and I had always looked 
forward to that pleasure. To me as a youngster the South was al- 
ways a land of romance and happiness—a place I had always dreamed 
about and had hoped to visit some day. I accepted also because I was 
anxious to have a chance to visit George Peabody College for Teachers. 
Until to-day George Peabody was to me, as to many other men, 
only a great name. I have learned in one day that George Peabody 
was one of the great educational heroes of America. I had thought 
that George Peabody College for Teachers was one of America’s 
greatest teachers colleges. I have learned since I arrived here that 
George Peabody College for Teachers is more than this. It rep- 
resents the forward movement of education in the South. I believe 
I have discovered the spirit of education in the South. To me it is 
typified by this wonderful new and efficient building, the splendid 
new administration building farther up the campus, and the new med- 
ical institution across the road. I have listened more than I have 
talked since I have been here in this city, and I have heard much about
-P-A-G-E-100
94 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
education in the South. The thing that has delighted me more than 
anything else has been that every Southerner I have talked to about 
education has told me about the future and not about the past. South- 
ern education is in the making, and George Peabody College for Teach- 
ers is leading the way. 
I bring greetings to you from the teacher-training institutions of 
the West. We in the West believe seriously in education, and we try 
to make our dreams come true. We take our job of training teachers 
seriously, and we think there is no occupation in the world quite as 
noble as that of training teachers for the boys and girls of America. 
If we in the teachers colleges certificate those who are morally wrong, 
intellectually inefficient, or physically incapable of the great work of 
teaching, we are untrue to our trust. 
It is with joy that I extend to this great college the greetings of the 
West on this, her fiftieth birthday. May the great work of George 
Peabody College for Teachers continue. 
RESPONSE FOR NORTHERN TEACHERS COLLEGES   
ERNEST BURNHAM 
Professor in Normal College, Kalamazoo, Mich. 
  
I am glad to come here to-day, in the necessary absence of the presi- 
dent of the institution where I am employed, as I find on this occasion 
a chance to say this personal word. Having spent several months now 
in the South, I have found my dream of the South and her humanity 
so true that I must express appreciation of the courtesies shown me 
and also the courtesy extended to me some seven years ago at this in- 
stitution. It is, indeed, a rich inspiration to carry back for the next 
period of my work in the North. 
I am honored to have the privilege of bringing from our state and 
neighbor states greetings to this great institution with all sincerity 
and thankfulness; for certainly if the institutions which represent the 
state and are supported by state appropriations (and, by the way, that 
word “appropriations” is what is keeping my president at home to- 
day)—if such institutions are to find their way to the front, they 
must have ideals by which to work. Ideals must be set out still far- 
ther in front to call them on; and if they may hopefully look anywhere 
for the realization of these ideals in advance, it seems to me it must be 
to such voluntary institutions as this school in the South, to Columbia 
in the East, and in the North to Chicago. We must turn to these great
-P-A-G-E-101
Second Day,—Burnham 95 
independent institutions to step out in front and give us ideals and 
courage. We must look to the men and women who come to these in- 
stitutions and receive training and who go out and demonstrate and 
make the challenge to multitudes of men and women to enlist in the 
great cause of education. 
Recently in these years of interpretation of the times, the artist, 
Innis, has painted a great picture, which is now being taken about to 
institutions and unveiled in the presence of ambitious young students 
in the hope that there may be made a challenge to them. He calls his 
masterpiece “The Only Hope.” In the foreground of the picture is a 
great desolation, the result of the years just passed; but in the back- 
ground, where there is a gray shadow, there appears a light, and that 
light presently comes to be the face of the Christ, and that face is in- 
terpreted by the artist as that of a great teacher. Likewise, George 
Peabody in another time, when interpretations were being sought and 
when means of coming to a better understanding were being set up, 
also found in the education of the teacher the solution. He, being a 
great constructive thinker, saw it, not in a picture on canvas, but in 
an institution on a campus, and for that we thank him. There is, as 
the years pass, rising in each generation a new interpretation—a new 
incarnation, if you please—of the great creative human spirit which 
lifts us up as teachers and lets us look into the ambitions of youth 
and challenge them to our profession as a great creative agency in 
progress. It is to this College grown up in the world through gifts 
of life and skill and contributions of philanthropy, through the high 
ideals lived up to and made real, that we turn to-day to get our cour- 
age to proceed on the routine and details of our work. So far as these 
different teacher-training schools are concerned, it is true that they 
are passing through a great crisis. They are passing out of the time 
when, with minor appropriations and small faculties, they prepare a 
few teachers for places financially able to employ them, into that great 
day foreseen by George Peabody when we shall really prepare ade- 
quately all the teachers needed in the universal service of the public 
schools. Time is short. The most precious human life is the life of 
little children, and it is for them that we must work. We must learn 
every sympathetic interpretation that will inspire their hopes, define 
their ambitions, and give permanence to their highest purposes. Only 
thus can proof be made of the sincerity of our praise of the great 
Peabody. 
I, thanking you from my heart in the name of the section from 
which I come and congratulating you on the past, the dynamic pres- 
ent, and the even greater future, give you Godspeed.

RESPONSE FOR THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF 
STATE UNIVERSITIES 
  
FRANK LEROND McVEY 
President, University of Kentucky 
  
Fifty years is a long time in the life of any man, but a short period 
in the history of an institution. Like any human event, the educa- 
tional institution is born an infant. Only now and then does it begin 
its history in full bloom. Peabody College was established in 1875, 
in the city of Nashville, through the beneficence of the Peabody Edu- 
cation Fund. This was but ten years after the close of the Civil War, 
in the midst of a great national depression and at a time when the 
training of teachers was little appreciated either North or South. 
A more important development took place in 1903 to 1909, when, 
through the codperation of city, county, state, and the Peabody Edu- 
cation Fund, the plant and facilities were enlarged by the added funds 
of more than two million dollars. In the years following other steps 
forward were taken, and George Peabody College for Teachers, with 
enlarged endowments and greater vision of its work, went at its task 
with new vigor. For twelve years past its progress has been notable, 
giving incentive to kindred institutions and maintaining the standards 
of a profession. 
Such, briefly stated, is the history of the institution whose fiftieth 
anniversary this notable assembly has come together to celebrate. 
And it is fitting that a half century of highly effective service should 
be marked by appropriate ceremonies. 
Education as a factor in the development of democracy grows more 
important as the decades pass. Life—social, intellectual, and indus- 
trial—is more complicated, requiring a constantly revised program of 
studies and closer approximation to life than ever before. The busi- 
ness of education is to keep abreast of national and world growth. 
This means that the teacher is the all-important element in this great 
change in national life. The teacher must, in order to meet the heavy 
responsibilities, have a professional attitude toward his work and 
bring to it personality, enthusiasm, judgment, and training. If this 
be taken as true, the importance of a great college for teachers, such 
as the one founded by the munificence of George Peabody, needs no 
new emphasis by any speaker of to-day. 
I am, however, not here to tell in detail the character of the work 
done by this college. As representative of the state universities, I

have pleasure in conveying the good wishes and congratulations of the 
National Association of State Universities. This organiation, formed 
by a small group of notable men, such as James Angell, Charles Ken- 
dall Adams, Cyrus Northrup, and George A. MacLean, held its first 
meeting thirty years ago. It now has a membership of forty-six uni- 
versities in the United States and three in the colonial possessions. 
Fifty years ago they were struggling institutions ; now they have great 
possessions, large faculties, many buildings, and extensive bodies of 
students. In all of them the courses for preparing teachers for the 
public-school system are well organized. The problem of training 
teachers is still one of the great difficulties in our national life. George 
Peabody College for Teachers, in dealing with these questions, has an 
opportunity for leadership both in research and instruction. Its con- 
tribution in these fields has been notable and of high order. Enthu- 
siastically and cordially the National Association of State Universities 
extends congratulations and good wishes for the growth, prosperity, 
and increasing influence of George Peabody College for Teachers. 
RESPONSE FOR PRIVATE AND DENOMINATIONAL 
COLLEGES 
  
HENRY N. SNYDER 
President of Wofford College, Spartanburg, S. C. 
  
In responding for what are called the “private institutions” on this 
significant occasion, I somehow feel that there is a sort of kinship of 
service between them and George Peabody College for Teachers. 
Both they and this noteworthy educational enterprise are products of 
a spirit and purpose that is characteristically American. From the 
very beginning of the history of the republic, long before the state 
accepted the duty of higher education by the method of public tax- 
ation, the individual initiative and codéperative effort of private citi- 
zens established and maintained colleges to keep burning the light of 
sound learning in the growing nation. Such institutions repeated 
themselves everywhere in the developing expansion of the republic; 
and while in a sense they might be called “private,” the spirit and 
purpose that brought them into existence and has kept them alive was 
that of a liberal and enlightened sense of public service; and in this 
they are the expression of something that is peculiarly and essentially 
American in the field of higher education.  
-P-A-G-E-106
  98 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
Institutions thus founded and maintained feel, therefore, especially 
privileged to share in the exercises commemorating the close of fifty 
years of the history of George Peabody College for Teachers. Each 
of them has a roll of honored names which it calls upon anniver- 
sary occasions—the names of those who sought to serve the peo- 
ple in notable ways by institutionalizing their money, their thought, 
their rare and compelling power of leadership. So when the name of 
George Peabody, with others, is mentioned here at this time, we can 
understand the terms of generous and grateful appreciation that are 
used and that large measure of deserved tribute which all are trying 
to pay. 
As the benefactor of a section in a special way, George Peabody 
must always be counted among the real builders of the nation. With 
the insight of a statesman and the vision of a prophet, he saw that the 
future of the South and its recovery from the ruin and bankruptcy of 
war lay with the children of the South; that what the children would 
become depended upon the kind of education they might receive; that 
the nature of their education would be determined by the quality 
of the teachers who led and directed it; and that, to get the right 
sort of leadership and direction, teaching must be made a profession 
and men and women definitely trained for it. Thus fifty years ago 
by the George Peabody benefactions were created educational ideals 
of lasting value to the South, and influences of service of a large and 
permanent kind were released. 
The whole South is, therefore, debtor to George Peabody College 
to an extent that cannot quite be measured by any standard of figures, 
in the fact that in the beginning it became an institution for the pro- 
fessional training of teachers, and this has been its distinctive mis- 
sion in the field of higher education in the South. Its recent extraor- 
dinary growth is significant in that it has followed, with added facili- 
ties, modern methods, and clearer and larger vision, the lines already 
determined by the purpose of its founders, and its history has more 
than justified their hopes for it. It is to be congratulated that to-day 
it stands the one institution which has an educational task peculiar 
to itself, and that it faces a future of large and expanding usefulness. 
In this usefulness every type of institution in the South may share, 
because each is virtually related to and concerned with the scientific 
training of those who shall direct the most fundamental enterprise a 
free people engages in—that of education.

RESPONSE FOR PRIVATELY ENDOWED 
UNIVERSITIES 
  
JAMES HAMPTON KIRKLAND 
Chancellor of Vanderbilt University 
  
Mr. CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT PAYNE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: 
I am supposed to speak for the group of endowed colleges—the 
group that is allowed to make no claim on denominational loyalty 
and is without the great financial support that comes through state 
control. I find, however, this division of educational institutions 
into categories unsatisfying. It is, after all, an unreal division. We 
are all one—one in our problems, one in our aspirations, one in our 
duties—and to-day we bring the same message to George Peabody 
College for Teachers, a message of congratulation, of loyal support, 
and of friendship. 
There are only two things that I feel like saying in these closing 
minutes. One is that an occasion like this emphasizes the work of the 
teacher in the great task of education. As we look about us on this 
campus and across the street, it would seem as if Nashville institu- 
tions were in the stone age, an age of building and material effort. 
President McVey said very properly that education is a great organ- 
ized activity. It calls for large equipment, many laboratories, tre- 
mendous resources; and yet we can never get away from the central 
truth that a teacher stands at the heart of this educational life. Ath- 
ens became the schoolmistress of the world without great buildings 
or great endowment. Socrates taught on street corners, and his les- 
sons are still being learned. Plato taught in an olive grove, and Zeno 
in a public porch. Until recently universities have had few build- 
ings and meager equipment outside of libraries, but for seven hundred 
years they have been the source of life and of light. They have lived 
through wars and revolutions. They have seen cities crumble, dynas- 
ties pass away, and nations die, while they have lived on. The birth 
of our oldest universities—as at Salerno, Naples, Bologna, and Paris— 
was due to the influence of great teachers, who, in some dismal rented 
hall or in their own homes, spoke the words that drew the world to 
them. 
The other thought that I have in connection with this day is that 
this institution has a remarkable and romantic history behind it. We 
have heard much of George Peabody, and all that we have heard is 
interesting and valuable; but after him there were many others who

earried on his work. New England gave the best of its life and 
thought to help the South, and hand in hand men from every section 
united to further the enterprise begun by Peabody. I do not know 
of any piece of educational work that has had attached to it such a 
splendid list of distinguished men as those who were attached to the 
Peabody Foundation from the day of its beginning. The first general 
agent was Dr. Barnas Sears, the president of Brown University, who 
laid down a splendid task to take up an untried piece of work. The 
“college,” as he called it, was never in such good condition, and he went 
on to say: “My duties are a perfect luxury.” I venture to say that 
within the past fifty years no college president has ever made such a 
statement as that. The duties of the presidential office are sometimes 
a joy, sometimes a burden, but never a luxury. Dr. Sears was fol- 
lowed by the eminent Southerner, Dr. Curry; and later on the work 
was taken up by one whom we claim for Nashville and for this insti- 
tution, Dr. Wickliffe Rose. 
We can wish for Dr. Payne no greater honor than to be added to 
this list of men whom I have named and to follow in their footsteps. 
I can wish for the students of George Peabody College for Teachers no 
greater distinction than that of embodying in their lives the history 
they have inherited and absorbing the traditions that have made sa- 
cred this institution of learning. 
THE HISTORY OF TEACHER TRAINING 
IN THE SOUTH 
  
CLAUDE A. PHILLIPS 
Professor of Elementary Education, University of Missouri 
  
The major intent in the founding of most of the early colleges in 
America was to make provision for such education as would give suita- 
ble training for the ministry. Undoubtedly, this was the most impor- 
tant motive in the case of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Asa matter 
of fact, this was professional education in theology. The larger move- 
ment for professional education, however, came much later than this, 
and not much was accomplished in it prior to the Revolution. Dur- 
ing the period between 1800 and 1830 there was a very definite agi- 
tation for professional schools. This included provision for medicine 
in Pennsylvania, King’s College (now Columbia University), and 
Harvard. Law schools were established at the University of Mary-
-P-A-G-E-109

land in 1812, at Harvard in 1817, at Yale in 1824, and at Virginia in 
1826. The first technical school, the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 
was founded in 1824. Schools of dentistry and pharmacy came along 
shortly after this period. The Lawrence Scientific School, at Har- 
vard, however, was not organized until 1847; the Sheffield Scientific 
School, at Yale, was not founded until 1860; and the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, not until 1862. It is well to remember that 
the scientific study of agriculture did not come about until after the 
passage of the Morrill Act by Congress in 1862. 
EARLY AGITATION FOR TEACHER TRAINING 
Along with the agitation for the forms of professional education 
mentioned above came the discussion of professional education for 
teachers. Cubberley says: “In a commencement address at Yale Col- 
lege, in 1816, by Denison Olmstead, on ‘The State of Education in 
Connecticut,’ a plan for ‘an academy for schoolmasters’ was outlined 
and urged to prepare intending teachers for ‘the organization and gov- 
ernment of a school.’” Shortly after this, in 1823, two papers were 
written urging the necessity of some such schools. In the year 1825 
two more appeared. To these four papers Mr. Barnard attaches 
much importance for the development of interest in teacher training 
in the United States. In 1824, Mr. James G. Carter (who has been 
called by some the “Father of the Massachusetts School System and 
Normal Schools”), published a pamphlet in which he urged very 
strongly the necessity of some sort of institution for the training of 
teachers. During the ten years from 1820 to 1830 there was much 
discussion in newspapers and public addresses regarding professional 
schooling for teachers. 
THE FIRST NORMAL SCHOOLS 
During this decade, 1820-1830, the first teacher-training school 
in America was established by the Rev. Samuel R. Hall, at Con- 
cord, Vt., in 1828. This school continued as a private institution for 
seven years, and Mr. Hall went to Massachusetts to open a similar 
school. Meanwhile, in 1827, Carter had opened a private school at 
Lancaster, Mass. This school he asked the State Legislature of 
Massachusetts to subsidize, because it was training teachers for the 
state schools. The first book on pedagogy was the one written by 
Hall, entitled “Lectures on School Keeping.” This book was pub- 
lished in 1829. It was a huge success from the first. Many thou- 
sands of copies of it were printed and distributed throughout the  
-P-A-G-E-110
  102 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
states. At least one of the Southern states, Kentucky, made large 
use of the book. 
Obviously it is not within the limits of this paper to discuss in 
detail the incidents concerning the establishment and organization 
of early normal schools, not in the South, in the various states in 
America, or the beginnings therein of official state support. It 
suffices to say that the publication of the reports by Cousin in 1835 
and Stowe in 1837 brought to a direct issue the question whether or 
not the state would support teacher-training institutions. Owing to 
the influence of Brooks, Carter, Mann, and others, Massachusetts, the 
first of the states to do so, made provision for the establishment of 
normal schools. On July 30, 1839, the first state normal school in 
America was opened in the town hall of Lexington, Mass. Its fac- 
ulty consisted of one instructor, and it had a student body of three. 
By the close of the first quarter only twelve students had been enrolled, 
and at the end of three years thirty-one. The course of study was one 
year in length; a student might, however, secure two years of instruc- 
tion. As nearly as we can make out, the school was organized much 
on the same lines as Hall’s, in Concord, Vt. It is reported that one of 
the distinctive features of the institution was a “Model School” in 
which students were expected to observe and teach. By 1860 twelve 
normal schools had been established in nine states, and eight more by 
1865, but not one of these in a Southern state. 
THE ORGANIZATION OF TEACHER-TRAINING INSTITUTIONS 
IN THE SOUTH 
According to the best information available, the first state normal 
school organized in the South was established at Fairmont, W. Va., 
in 1867. By 1872 there were, in all, forty state normals. At the 
present time—or, rather, in 1921-1922, the year covered by the last 
published report of the United States Commissioner of Education— 
the number has risen to eighty teachers colleges, one hundred and ten 
state normal schools, sixty-three private normal schools, thirty-four 
city normal schools, and ninety-five county normal schools. This 
paper will concern itself, however, only with teachers colleges, state 
normal schools, and the teacher-training departments in state univer- 
sities. 
In a brief account of teacher training in the South, it is probably 
well to chronicle at the beginning the dates for the founding of the 
various Southern normal schools. From the best information I can

find, these schools were established in the years shown in the accom-

Apparently there are now twenty-eight teachers colleges and six- 
teen normal schools in the states mentioned. This may not be abso- 
lutely accurate, for the last really dependable data are in the Commis- 
sioner of Education’s report for the year ending in June, 1922. 
THE PEABODY FUND 
Undoubtedly the most important factor in developing teacher 
training for the South came through the magnificent contribution of 
George Peabody, who constituted the Peabody Fund, February 7, 
1867. The original amount was $1,000,000. The income from this 
sum was to be used for the promotion of teacher training and for 
public education in general throughout the Southern states. It is not 
within the province of this paper to follow in any detail the distribu- 
tion of the Peabody Fund. Dr. Curry, its field agent, reported that 
more than $2,478,527.13 was distributed to the Southern states by the 
Peabody Board during the thirty years of its existence. Of this sum, 
$248,562.25 was contributed directly to the Peabody Normal College, 
and $398,690.88 was contributed indirectly to the Normal College by 
means of scholarships granted to prospective teachers from the states 
‘Knight says that there was not a single one in the South in 1868. 
*The dates of the founding of three schools I have been unable to secure.
-P-A-G-E-112
  104 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North 
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Vir- 
ginia. Without this contribution from the Peabody Fund, it is diffi- 
cult to prophesy what would have happened regarding teacher train- 
ing in the South. It may be noted that the state normal schools were 
all founded after the fund was constituted, and that all the early ones 
were organized directly under its influence. 
THE INFLUENCE OF PESTALOZZI 
Another contribution to the development of normal schools in the 
United States was the Pestalozzian movement which swept over the 
country following the common-school revival. As a matter of fact, 
the spread of Pestalozzianism throughout the world had very much 
to do with the establishment of normal schools. It is worthy of note 
that the period of agitation, to which we called attention in another 
paragraph, was during the time of the wonderful experiment of Pes- 
talozzi at Yverdon. This experiment closed in 1827. Pestalozzian 
teachers and disciples were very influential everywhere in the move- 
ment for teacher training. Two notable pioneers in America may be 
mentioned in connection with this period of agitation and early pro- 
motion. One was Arnold Guyot, who was for some time a professor 
of geology in Princeton and an able lecturer for the Massachusetts 
State Board of Education in the teachers’ institutes. The second was 
Herman Krusi, Jr., son of one of the teachers under Pestalozzi, who 
came to America in 1852. He lectured in many institutes, and was 
also connected with the Oswego Normal School, where he was a pro- 
fessor for many years. These two, with Miss Margaret Jones, con- 
stituted the leaven which made the Pestalozzian method an important 
factor in all normal-school training in America. More than two hun- 
dred graduates of the Oswego State Normal School came South and 
taught in one or more of the institutions which we have listed. 
THE INFLUENCE OF HERBART 
Another significant factor in the development of normal schools in 
the South, as well as in the rest of the United States, was the Herbar- 
tian movement, which swept over the country in the nineties and con- 
tinued to be of considerable importance until about 1910. Nearly all 
the Southern normal schools were directly affected by the books in- 
terpreting Herbartian thought to this country which were written 
by De Garmo and the McMurrys. Three books—namely, The Es- 
sentials of Method, by De Garmo, published in 1889; General Method, 
by Charles A. McMurry, in 1892; and The Method of the Recitation,
-P-A-G-E-113
  
Second Day,—Phillips 105 
by Charles A. and Frank McMurry, published in 1897—were gener- 
ally used as textbooks in method in all the normal schools of the South 
until about 1910. The National Herbartian Society also exercised 
some influence on teacher training in the South. This influence was 
not so great here, however, as in the northern portion of the Missis- 
sippi Valley. From this Herbartian movement there came a general 
enrichment of the elementary curriculum; especially, there was added 
to it a considerable amount of history, literature, nature study, and 
geography. Through the normal schools the Herbartians contributed 
directly to this important expansion of the school course. 
THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF EDUCATION 
The final factor to be mentioned in the development of teacher train- 
ing in normal schools and universities is the advent of the scientific 
movement in education. This feature of the development was at first 
fostered chiefly by students who came from Clark University, Teachers 
College, the University of Chicago, and Johns Hopkins. Since its 
organization, in 1914, George Peabody College for Teachers has con- 
tributed through its students in a most significant way to this move- 
ment in the South. Shortly after 1910 the normal schools and teach- 
ers colleges began to put in modern courses in psychology and in edu- 
cational tests, and in the last five years have added courses in mental 
tests. 
THE CURRICULA IN TEACHERS COLLEGES IN THE SOUTH 
The state normal schools, with a few possible exceptions, early or- 
ganized only a single-track curriculum. At first the minimum en- 
trance requirements were the completion of the eighth grade. This 
remained until nearly 1900 the common entrance requirement for 
almost all the normal schools in the South. In the meantime a few of 
them planned special curricula which required high-school graduation 
for entrance. The first curriculum required four years for comple- 
tion; not uncommonly, however, there was a break after the comple- 
tion of the first two years and some sort of temporary license pro- 
vided here. It was the common practice to grant a state life certifi- 
cate at the conclusion of the four-year curriculum. The fact should 
be noted, however, that as soon as the curriculum was organized which 
admitted only high-school graduates, it usually occupied only two 
years, and the life certificate was granted at its completion. Obvi- 
ously this was only a makeshift arrangement; for in the one case a 
student spent four years in preparing for normal-school graduation,
-P-A-G-E-114
106 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
whereas in the case of the high-school graduate six years was occu- 
pied in reaching the same level. 
It is too long a story to give in detail here the changes which oc- 
curred in the period from 1900 to the present time, during which the 
larger number of these institutions came to a college basis. Obviously 
the reason for this change can be found in the demands made on the 
teacher-training institutions to supply adequately trained teachers for 
high schools. Moreover, the direct competition arising between the 
normal schools and other institutions made it imperative for the 
teacher-training institutions to develop to a quantitative as well as 
qualitative basis comparable to the standard college. 
The early curricula provided largely for the review of the common 
branches, together with professional work in method, psychology, 
history of education, and observation and practice teaching. The aca- 
demic work was mostly of high-school grade rather than of college 
rank. Undoubtedly this level of instruction was proper for the stu- 
dents who had been poorly trained in inadequate elementary schools 
and needed a more thorough grounding in the subjects there taught in 
order to go back into the schools and render effective service as teach- 
ers. It is a long story to relate how, in the course of time, the com- 
mon branches have become of less and less importance in the curricu- 
lum of the teacher-training schools. At the present time such review 
work constitutes a very small fraction of the total amount of the re- 
quirement of a two-year curriculum in a normal school or teachers 
college and a still smaller part of the curricula of a standard four- 
year teachers college. It is almost a miracle, too—the rapidity with 
which the state normal schools of the South have developed to the basis 
of standard teachers colleges requiring four years of high-school work 
for entrance and four years of college work for the degree. 
As was noted in another paragraph, more than half of all the state 
teacher-training institutions which were formerly normal schools are 
now teachers colleges, with power to grant degrees. Statistics will 
be presented later to show that these institutions are granting at the 
present time about twice as many degrees in Education as are all the 
academic colleges, public and private, and all the universities, public 
and private, in the South. The exact figures are 732 degrees by the 
teachers colleges and 414 by all the others mentioned. 
TEACHER TRAINING IN THE COLLEGES AND STATE UNIVERSITIES 
It is almost impossible to make any comprehensive or accurate 
statement concerning the training of teachers in the colleges or uni- 
versities of the South, at least any brief statement.
-P-A-G-E-115
Second Day,—Phillips 107 
It appears that very early an attempt was made to do something for 
teacher training in connection with the school which was established 
at Salisbury, N. C., in 1785, by the Rev. C. McCorkle. Knight says 
that a normal department was organized in connection with this in- 
stitution, and that for a number of years it contributed materially to 
the training of teachers in North Carolina. Possibly this institution 
was of secondary rank. At various times in the early history of the 
University of North Carolina also some attention was given to the 
training of teachers. One of the notable efforts was that made by 
Calvin H. Wiley, who was made State Superintendent of Schools in 
1852. Throughout the fourteen years of his superintendency he la- 
bored continually to secure the training of teachers. The normal 
college which was located in Randolph County, N. C., and was the 
forerunner of Trinity College, did a good deal for the training of 
teachers during this period of Wiley’s efforts to promote teacher train- 
ing. 
The General Assembly of the state of Missouri also made early pro- 
vision for the training of teachers in a law which was enacted in 1849. 
This scheme provided that one boy should be selected from each county 
in the state, to be sent to the university to prepare to be a teacher. 
The plan provided for one student from each county every two years. 
The student was required to sign a pledge that he would teach in a 
school in the state for a minimum of two years. The curators of the 
University of Missouri were authorized to establish a normal profes- 
sorship. Nothing was done about the matter, however, until 1857, 
when a normal department was organized. This department passed 
through varying experiences with little or no success, and disappeared 
during the war period. However, in 1867 a college of normal instruc- 
tion was organized, and from that time to the present day the univer- 
sity has made provision for the training of teachers, for both elemen- 
tary and high schools. At the present time it has a School of Educa- 
tion, which proposes to train teachers for all types of positions. 
Doubtless there were numerous other attempts at teacher training 
in connection with the colleges and universities of the South. As soon 
as the Peabody Fund was created and it became known that, under 
certain conditions, institutions might secure funds from it, a number 
of state and private institutions applied for this subsidy. In general, 
the funds were granted only to state institutions. When the trust was 
ended, a number of the state universities secured sums from the Pea- 
body Fund for purposes of endowment or buildings. At the present 
time eight of the Southern state universities have Schools of Educa- 
tion, four have Colleges of Education, and three have Departments.

The most common degree granted by these institutions is Bachelor of 
Science in Education, though some grant a Bachelor of Arts in Educa- 
tion, and one of them, the University of Kentucky, gives no degree in 
Education at all. For the year ending June, 1922, all the state univer- 
sities and colleges in the South gave only 293 degrees in Education, 
and only 414 degrees in Education were granted in that year by all of 
the colleges and universities together in these sixteen states. Quan- 
titatively, this hardly seems to be a very large contribution. 
From the figures presented in the above tables it will be noted that 
all together the teacher-training institutions of the Southern states 
granted, in 1921-1922, the most recent year for which there are offi- 
cial reports, certificates and degrees as follows: State normal schools, 
1,265; teachers colleges, 4,485; all universities and other colleges, 
414—making a total of 6,164. It will be observed that this enumera- 
tion includes the students who secured a certificate representing two 
years or more of college training. It does not include other types of 
certificates issued by the state superintendent, the normal school, or 
the colleges.

THE SUPPLY AND THE DEMAND 
In connection with the foregoing statements regarding the output 
from the Southern teacher-training schools, it may be well to ask the 
question: How nearly does this supply of teachers satisfy the demand 
for new teachers in the South? The November, 1924, number of 
the Research Bulletin of the National Education Association presents. 
a table of the “State Turnover of Teachers” for the year 1922-1923. 
This table is made up of data estimated and reported by the state 
superintendents of public instruction. It is here reproduced:

From this table one notes that some 42,855 new teachers were 
needed in the South at the beginning of the school year, 1922-1923, 
whereas our Southern total of trained teachers produced in 1922 at the 
level of two years or more of college work was 6,164. The discrep- 
ancy is even greater than appears, for Kentucky made no report re- 
garding the number of new teachers needed and is not included in the 
above table. Apparently we have a long way yet to go in teacher 
training, if two years’ study above the high school is the minimum 
preparation which shall prevail for a professional teacher. 
ATTENDANCE OF STUDENTS AT NORMAL SCHOOLS AND 
TEACHERS COLLEGES 
Using again the Commissioner of Education’s data for the year 
1921-1922, we find that there were then enrolled in the state normal 
schools of the eleven Southern states which still report their institu- 
tions under this title 14,600 white students. For the United States, 
as a whole, 110 normal schools reported; there were in them some
-P-A-G-E-119
Second Day,—Phillips Atel} 
76,000 students. In the teachers colleges of the twelve states of the 
South having such institutions there were 37,635 students, and in the 
teachers colleges of the United States, as a whole, 129,237 students. 
It is worthy of note that there are twice as many students in teachers 
colleges in the South as in normal schools. The total of students in 
training in the South in normal schools and teachers colleges is 52,235. 
EXPENDITURES FOR NORMAL SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS COLLEGES 
For the year 1921-1922, the latest year reported, the United States 
Commissioner of Education states that the total expenditure for 110 
state normal schools was $12,094,000. For the state normal schools 
of the eleven Southern states having such institutions the expendi- 
ture was $2,103,000. For the teachers colleges of the country, 78 
institutions in all, the expenditure was $14,082,000. In the South, in 
this year, $5,000,000 went to the support of teachers colleges. The 
Southern total for 1921-1922 for the two kinds of teacher-training 
institutions is, therefore, $7,103,000. There is not a little satisfac- 
tion to be had from considering these figures, for the sum now spent in 
the South alone is almost exactly the amount spent by all of the states 
of the Union for teacher training about twenty years ago; in 1904-1905 
the total national contribution to teacher-training schools was $7,962,- 
299. The amount now spent in the South is about half the sum spent 
by the entire country ten years ago. It is, however, only about one- 
sixth of the total amount now spent altogether—that is, $41,239.000. 
There are some problems in the financing of teacher training in the 
South yet to be solved. 
THE FUTURE IN TEACHER TRAINING 
It seems clear to the writer that all the normal schools of the South 
should be developed to a sound teachers-college basis at once. There 
has been a rapid movement in this direction, for it is quite clear that 
the teachers college, as an institution, is a better type than the old 
normal school, which stood essentially halfway between high school 
and college and had no actual academic status at all. To develop the 
one type from the other is, however, a serious problem. Making a 
sound collegiate institution out of such an organization as the old- 
type normal school is not easy. 
BETTER PREPARED FACULTIES 
As an illustration of the difficulties to be encountered, let me cite the 
matter of the academic preparation of faculties. I have just taken up 
at random fifteen current catalogs from institutions, including both
-P-A-G-E-120
112 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
teachers colleges and normal schools, which propose to grant degrees. 
By far the best—and, in fact, almost the only—index of the merit of 
a teacher now available is the level of preparation he has attained. 
In the fifteen catalogs the first twenty names in each faculty list were 
taken for study—a total of 800 names. The following data were 
obtained: 199 faculty members have a Bachelor’s degree or less in 
preparation, 88 have a Master’s degree, 13 have a Doctor’s degree. 
Stated in percentages, 66% of the members of these faculties have 
not more than Bachelor’s degrees, 29% have Master’s, and 4% have 
Doctor’s. Obviously these colleges have much yet to do in the matter 
of securing faculties with appropriate training to give really high- 
class college instruction. 
In the higher preparation of teachers for such institutions, the state 
universities, to which apparently the task should largely fall, seem 
to have made as yet a very meager contribution indeed. The prepara- 
tion of teachers for the Southern training schools has been, and still 
is, in spite of the teachers-college movement, exceedingly inadequate. 
It would seem to the writer that a very efficient organization of the 
Southern teacher-training institutions themselves should be made at 
once, so that some such standards as are now proposed by the Southern 
Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools may be put into effect at 
the very earliest moment. Moreover, it would seem wise for the state 
universities, the state teachers colleges, and the normal schools of 
every state in the South to set up at once a good working codperation 
to enforce the standards which will be constructed by the larger or- 
ganization. Undoubtedly there is enough and more to do than all the 
agencies can accomplish in the near future to secure an adequately 
trained body of teachers for all the schools in the South. 
The state universities should attack more seriously than they have 
in the past the preparation of teachers at the higher-degree level; 
more graduate work should be organized ; and this should be done im- 
mediately. All professional education—for engineering, law, medi- 
cine, theology, and education—is now recognized to entail research. 
And at present all the Southern universities have wholly inadequate 
provisions for research. We have come to a place in our educational 
experience in the nation where we must do something more than 
“guessing.” Every profession recognizes this. The high-grade de-- 
velopment of faculty material for the teacher-training institutions— 
and, indeed, for all the professions—is a matter for research special- 
ists in the universities. 
In view of the facts presented in this paper regarding teacher- 
training institutions, the present-day movement for developing both
-P-A-G-E-121

schools and teachers, and the need for research, may I say, in closing, 
that certainly George Peabody College for Teachers has before it in 
the years to come a large and uncharted field of usefulness in insisting 
upon and partially itself providing the leadership, the high scholar- 
ship, and the men and women for research to do the big work which 
is now in the immediate future in teacher training in the South. 
THE PEABODY DEMONSTRATION SCHOOL 
  
THOMAS ALEXANDER 
Teachers College, Columbia University 
  
PRESIDENT PAYNE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BOYS AND GIRLS OF THE 
DEMONSTRATION SCHOOL: 
It gives me unusual pleasure to speak to you on the occasion of the 
dedication of the new building for the Peabody Demonstration School, 
because my life for the last ten years has been so intimately associated 
with the school and with you who have had to do with its development. 
It is also a source of great gratification to me that so many boys and 
girls, former students in the early days of the school, together with 
their parents, are present this afternoon to take part in the exercises. 
It is particularly pleasing that many of the teachers and two of the 
former principals of the school who were with the school at its be- 
ginning are present to-day, for without their sacrifices this structure 
would not be dedicated at this hour. 
I find it difficult, Mr. President, to speak to you and to this group 
except in terms of our school and about our policies and about what 
we should do, for, though I am no longer officially one of your staff, 
much of my affection will always be given to this school and to this 
institution. So with your permission I shall speak this afternoon in 
the first person, just as if I were still one of you. 
The idea of laboratory schools was evolved slowly and gradually 
during the days of the reorganization of George Peabody College for 
Teachers. Our new conception of the intimate place to be occupied 
by laboratory schools in teacher-training colleges in the future is so 
well founded that there should be no longer a welcome place for the 
individual in any professional faculty who does not consider first of all 
the relations that should exist between his work and that of the labo- 
ratory schools.  
-P-A-G-E-122
  114 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
Progress in this field has been slow. We have refused to use the 
experimental materials which lie at hand. To me it is beyond all com- 
prehension why any trainer of teachers desires to separate himself 
from his laboratory. But such is the case. My only explanation is 
that it is easier to sit in an office and calmly theorize than it is to test 
the theories in the fire of experience and find that the most of them 
are without value. 
When the curriculum of Peabody College was reorganized in 1914, 
no provision was made at all for practice or demonstration-school fa- 
cilities. I have never heard the explanation. 
In the old days a beginning was made in the Winthrop Model School, 
which was a school of observation, mainly with elementary grades, 
from 1889 to 1907, and then till 1911 provided with some practice 
teaching in the city schools under a supervisor from the Winthrop fac- 
ulty. Afterwards, in our new enterprise, our classes in education and 
in all subjects were carried on without reference to laboratory schools 
except for a little observation in the city schools in 1914-15. The 
need for children in connection with a teachers college, strange to say, 
did not seem to be felt by many members of the staff. 
Miss Yetta S. Shoninger, professor of elementary education in Pea- 
body College in 1914-17, was the prime mover in bringing the neces- 
sity of laboratory facilities to the attention of the faculty. She had 
done an outstanding piece of work in organizing the training-school 
facilities at Harrisonburg, Va., and found herself and her classes in 
the entirely strange situation of training teachers how to teach with- 
out having a laboratory in which to work. 
We began with a small summer school for children, used for obser- 
vation purposes, organized in the summer of 1915 by H. G. Swanson, 
Joseph Roemer, and the speaker, conducted in the basement and lower 
floor of the Jesup Psychological Laboratory. 
In the audience this afternoon there are many fathers and mothers 
but for whose help there would have been no school on this campus, 
and it has been their loyalty and far-sighted sympathy that has made 
the steady development of the school possible. It has occurred to 
many of you that a laboratory of children is just as necessary in the 
training of teachers as is a hospital or clinic in the training of doc- 
tors or a chemical laboratory in the training of chemists. There is, 
however, a very important difference between the organization of a 
laboratory for children and the organization of a chemical laboratory 
or hospital. It is easy to buy chemical materials and apparatus, and 
no one interferes with the chemist’s procedure. Very few people at-

tempt to tell the surgeons how the operations are to be performed. 
Everybody knows how a child should be educated. 
It seems to me to-day that from this nucleus of boys and girls gath- 
ered in 1915-16 have developed the spirit and genius of the Peabody 
Demonstration School. They, young though they were and are, 
seemed from the first to sense the fact that they were taking part in 
the educational project which was to play its part in the reorganiza- 
tion of education in the Southland, and their interpretation in acts 
and deeds has done much to clarify and set forth the theories held by 
the teachers working in the school. 
To-day the Peabody Demonstration School commands the respect 
of the community. In the dedication of this building these boys and 
girls, together with their parents, may be pardoned if they take great 
pride in what they have accomplished for the educational growth of 
their state and country. They will never know what their devotion 
and love for their school have meant for upholding those who have 
borne its responsibility. 
A few of the teachers who have helped build this school came to us 
already equipped with a high degree of skill; others, younger in years, 
were attracted to the school on account of the opportunity it offered 
for creative thinking along educational lines. To-day in the expan- 
sion of this school the most difficult problem is to find teachers who 
have vision and ability to give substance to their dreams. 
The first teacher employed in the Demonstration School was Pro- 
fessor Harvey Guy Swanson, at the present time dean of the North- 
east Missouri State Teachers College. He agreed to stay for the year 
for $800, act as principal of the school, and teach history and civics. 
Please remember that he knew we did not have a cent at the time he 
agreed to stay. Several others thought the idea of a laboratory school 
was a good one, but only Mr. Swanson would take any financial risk in 
the matter. His sound financial sense over a period of three years put 
the school on its feet. When he left in 1918, the school had an enroll- 
ment of over three hundred children, with a long waiting list. He had 
a cash balance of $2,000, built up on the small tuition schedule, rang- 
ing from $25 to $50. But Mr. Swanson did more than that. He 
breathed into the lives of the pupils the spirit of American citizen- 
ship and ideals which have permeated the school ever since. It is a 
great pleasure to have him here to-day to celebrate this hour with us. 
Dr. Joseph Roemer, now of the University of Florida, was given 
his tuition in the College to act as principal-assistant. His chief du- 
ties were to act as head janitor, keep the children off the grass, and 
to see that no ehild entered a door which was used by an adult. Out-  
-P-A-G-E-124
116 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
side of these duties, he was our chief disciple of joy, of which there 
was much need in those days. His contribution to Peabody College 
was not a small one in the days when the entire college enrollment was 
scarcely two hundred. It took courage to come to Peabody College in 
those days, when it was all the fashion to go elsewhere for higher 
work in education. It is good to have Dr. Roemer here to-day to see 
the harvest of some of his sowing. I can tell you, Mr. President, it 
repays us for all those years of struggle to have these two pioneers 
with us at this hour. 
So that was the administrative and janitorial staff of the first year. 
On one basis or another Miss Bertha Matthews was appointed to teach 
the first and second grades; Miss Margaret Lemon, to teach grades 
three and four; while Mr. John T. Wade and Miss Roberta Dubose, 
with Mr. Swanson, were to carry on the regular class work of the up- 
per grades. Manual training was taught by Mr. Dwight Knapp; 
household economics, by Miss Anna Cooper, Miss Carrie Scobey, and 
Miss Mary Wilson. The total budget for salaries and all other ex- 
penses for the entire year was slightly above $3,000. The budget for 
the school during 1924-25 has been over $60,000 and next year will 
approximate $100,000. I think there ought to be a bronze tablet to 
these heroes and heroines of human progress, for they gave all they 
had, which was much. 
I shall name some teachers who have served longest and who have 
remained with the school over a period of years sufficient for them to 
leave a marked impress upon the school. 
In December of 1915 we employed Miss Ruth McMurry, daughter 
of Dr. Charles A. McMurry, who is to-day one of the best-known 
American educators. She has upheld nobly the great traditions of that 
famous family of teachers and has done in the school an outstanding 
piece of work in the teaching of French. And her work is only begun. 
Miss May Pitts is more intimately associated with the internal de- 
velopment of the school and of its educational significance than any 
other. She came to the school shortly after its organization and has 
labored unremittingly for the cause of education since that time. She 
is only a classroom teacher and aspires to be nothing more, but she has 
contributed more to sound thinking in the elementary education field 
than any one thus far in connection with Peabody College. If any 
one really wants to know the story of the Peabody Demonstration 
School, let him ask Miss McMurry and Miss Pitts. 
After Mr. Swanson resigned the principalship of the Demonstra- 
tion School, Mr. James S. Tippett, of the Kansas City public schools, 
now of Lincoln School, Columbia University, became principal of the
-P-A-G-E-125
  
Second Day,—Alexander 117 
school and its guiding spirit during the most trying days of its history. 
It was Mr. Tippett who gave to the school its educational character 
and quickened it with the spirit of modern educational thought. No 
one has left on the school such a deep impress as he, both on the 
curriculum of the school and upon the lives of the pupils with whom 
he came in contact. If he had had adequate funds and equipment, he 
would have made out of it in a very few years the outstanding modern 
school of this country. Poverty is not always a blessing. 
There are three women who always stand out in my mind when con- 
sidering the builders of the school and of our program for the educa- 
tion of girls. These women are: Miss Anna Cooper (now Mrs. Nor- 
man Frost), Mrs. E. L. Parsons, and Miss Nell Crain. Miss Cooper 
was the teacher of home economics, or, at least, that was what she 
was employed to do, but her great work was the building of the right 
conception of womanhood in the lives and minds of our girls. There 
was no activity of the school to which she did not turn her willing and 
capable hands. Along the same lines, but as a teacher of Latin, Mrs. 
Parsons has contributed for years and is still contributing to the 
whole life of the school, not only by being the outstanding Latin 
teacher in this part of the country, but chiefly by being an interpreter 
of all that is good and fine in life to the girls of the school. In still 
another field—however, to the same general end—Miss Crain has 
done an extraordinary thing in physical education with the girls of 
the school. It has been not alone with their bodies that she has been 
concerned, but with their spirits that she has done the most. The 
girls in this school seem to me to excel any other similar group phys- 
ically, mentally, and morally—all of which is due to the work of Miss 
Crain, Mrs. Parsons, and Miss Cooper. 
There is here to-day the third principal of the Demonstration 
School—Professor Irving P. Foote, of the Louisiana State University. 
He, together with Mr. Lynton F. Garrett, took charge of the school 
for one year after the resignation of Mr. Tippett in 1922. These two 
men did much to reéstablish the financial foundations of the school 
and were of much assistance in drawing the plans for this building. 
Of the college faculty I wish to acknowledge the constant and far- 
seeing encouragement of Dr. Charles A. McMurry. While he took 
no active part in the administration of the school, his advice and coun- 
sel were always at our command. In the faculty meetings he bore 
his share of the battles of the school, and in determining its policies 
he has played a very important part. 
Dr. Charles E. Little, professor of the Teaching of Latin, has done 
more than any other faculty member for this school. It gives me 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  118 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
more than usual pleasure to say this to the group here this afternoon. 
For several years I have relied upon Dr. Little’s great interest in help- 
ing to make our school possible that we are dedicating to-day. Noone 
realizes what strenuous times we have had in realizing our plan so 
well as does Dr. Little. No one realizes better than he the importance 
of such laboratory facilities in a teacher-training institution. To 
him are due the thanks of all succeeding generations of pupils. 
Now, last of all, I wish to mention the Demonstration School’s long- 
time friend. He is one who is not a faculty member, but in all these 
years it has been he who helped us find a way to finance our under- 
taking. I don’t know where he got the money on certain occasions, 
but he always found a place from which to beg or borrow. He has 
scolded us and lectured us like a father for our extravagances and lack 
of business sense, yet under it all he has loved the school more than 
any other. So to-day I wish to introduce to the audience Mr. E. W. 
Connell, bursar of the College, our quiet friend who has worked be- 
hind the scenes. 
No sooner had the Demonstration School been started in the fall of 
1915 than plans were laid for a new building to house the project. 
I suppose we have formulated a hundred different plans for this build- 
ing. The parents and the children here this afternoon will recall the 
many plans and efforts that we have made together. In fact, we had 
dreamed so long of this building and had been disappointed so often 
that many of the children had begun to think that their children would 
be the ones first privileged to attend school in this building. Plans 
were drawn and redrawn to match the laboratory problems of the 
College as we could best interpret them. The building as it stands 
to-day leaves much to be accomplished, but let us use well what we 
have and let the future provide for further growth for our complete 
program of educational laboratories. This building which is dedi- 
cated to-day will house only one small part of this program of George 
Peabody College for Teachers. 
Several years ago we conceived the plan of organizing our labora- 
tory schools for three general purposes—demonstration teaching, 
practice teaching, and experimental procedure. This threefold objec- 
tive has been attained only in a very small way and in a very unsatis- 
factory manner, except with reference to demonstration teaching in 
general and in some minor educational experiments. We have to-day 
no reason at hand for altering this threefold objective. 
As early as 1916 a bulletin was published in which the organization 
of the school was set forth, as well as a tentative program of studies. 
It was our plan to organize two classes for each grade from the kin-
-P-A-G-E-127
Second Day,—Alexander 119 
dergarten through the twelfth grade, one section of each grade to be 
used for demonstration purposes, while the other section would be 
used for practice teaching. It was recognized from the beginning, 
however, that practice teaching in this institution would have to be a 
very different thing from that which is ordinarily thought of in a 
normal school under that term, since a very large majority of the stu- 
dents in Peabody College were experienced teachers. 
The question of educational experimentation almost lost this build- 
ing for Peabody College. We were told ten years ago and have been 
repeatedly told that the South had no need for such a school as this 
building will house. We were told this year that we had no business 
to take any interest in experimental education. 
What sort of laboratory experience does an intending teacher of 
education in a teachers college, or a school supervisor or superintend- 
ent, or the teacher of geography or any other subject in a higher 
institution, need? Certainly that experience is demanded which is 
most like the type of work he intends to do after the completion of his 
preparatory training. The type of practice school that Peabody Col- 
lege needs is a “practice normal school,” a complete normal school 
within Peabody College, so as to provide critic teachers and super- 
visors of student teaching and teachers of the various subjects in nor- 
mal schools and colleges with those techniques demanded in such posi- 
tions. Experimentation, demonstration, and practice in college and 
normal-school teaching are as necessary as on the elementary or high- 
school level. If Peabody College is to train teachers for teachers col- 
leges of the South, she must meet these demands adequately. This 
Demonstration School should expand in time so as to provide demon- 
stration of and practice for college teaching. Again I see the exten- 
sion of such practice facilities beyond the walls of the institution. 
Neighboring teachers colleges will be glad to furnish practice and 
demonstration facilities for all types of teachers trained here at this 
College. 
What type of practice is necessary for administrators and school 
supervisors? Again it is clear that the ordinary practice and demon- 
stration school no longer suffices. The rural supervisor, the elemen- 
tary-school principal, the city supervisor, the superintendent, all 
should have field experience under direction before being certified as 
thoroughly qualified. It seems to me strange that all of our leading 
teacher-training institutions are providing nothing more than theo- 
retical training for these leading and important positions. There is 
no lack of laboratory facilities for this work, but they are disregarded 
and left undeveloped.
-P-A-G-E-128
  120 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
And, finally, there must be a more varied type of demonstration 
facilities under the control of the College or available to it. It seems 
to me that every important theory held forth in classes ought to be 
demonstrated in a concrete way, or, at least, an approximation of that 
theory should be attempted. In the past ten years the present Dem- 
onstration School has performed outstanding service in clarifying edu- 
cational theory to the students of the College. But the campus school 
alone will no longer suffice. We should have a demonstration normal 
school, a demonstration rural school, and demonstration schools for 
the under-privileged child. Indeed, I should advocate linking up the 
College with certain progressive school systems which would serve as 
demonstration units in our comprehensive plan for laboratory schools. 
I have tried to sketch in a very brief way and in large outline the 
organization of laboratory-school facilities for an institution like 
George Peabody College for Teachers. It will take years to perfect 
or even approach such a development, but it is to this purpose that 
we shall dedicate this building to-day. 
This is, Mr. President, a sort of report of the chairman of your 
Demonstration School Committee. I could not begin to tell you how 
much it has meant to me personally to work with you in these past 
years in behalf of these children and the other countless thousands in 
our country. I am sure I could not utter the sentiments of personal 
appreciation that I feel toward you. Your leadership has been inspir- 
ing and uplifting. I alone of all know how many hours of toil and 
thought you have given that this building might be here to-day. I 
wish to thank you for the privilege of having been one of your soldiers. 
RECENT ADVANCE IN THE PROFESSIONAL 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS 
  
JAMES EARL RUSSELL 
Dean of Teachers College, Columbia University 
  
Forty years ago teaching in this country was either a trade or a 
calling; it could hardly be characterized as a profession. As a trade, 
it was taken up by those who found it an easier way to earn a living 
than by domestic service or farm labor. Others accepted the call to 
teach as religiously as ministers of the gospel heeded the call to 
preach. Fine scholarship, combined with native ability and guided 
by high ideals, made great teachers. They were few and far between,
-P-A-G-E-129
Second Day,—Russell 121 
but they were the salt of the earth. Their lives and works, their 
ideals and methods, are objects of our closest study in the effort to 
construct the science and art of education. 
THE BACKWARD LOOK IN EDUCATIONAL METHOD 
The old way of passing on to novices the accumulated wisdom and 
experience of the masters was ingrained in tradition. Scholarship 
was a definite entity, whether viewed from the standpoint of the 
teacher in the district school or of the teacher in the college. A cer- 
tain quantum of knowledge was expected in each successive grade— 
an amount so precise that it could be defined in terms of textbooks or 
treatises or courses of study. Standards were centuries old—modi- 
fied, of course, to meet the exigencies of particular situations, but still 
essentially the standards of the past. And, in practice, any tendency 
to vary from the norm was inevitably checked by the apprentice sys- 
tem, whereby each beginner was forced to follow in the footsteps of 
his master. 
THE LOOK AROUND FOR IDEAS REGARDING TEACHING 
The first step in advance was taken when, besides the backward 
look, the beginner was encouraged to look round about him. Instead 
of one master, he was asked to assimilate the teachings of many mas- 
ters. This process of analyzing the standards and modes of success- 
ful teachers and administrative officers was the beginning of modern 
educational research. I well recall the answer given me when I asked 
one of the most famous school superintendents in the East to give a 
course of two hours a week for a year on educational administration. 
He said: “Why, I haven’t enough to last six weeks.” The pity was, 
’twas true. There was not enough information available to keep a 
class of graduate students, prospective school superintendents, profit- 
ably occupied for a month, much less a year. 
No part of our undertaking, however, has been found easier or more 
profitable than research in the field of school organization and man- 
agement. So long as the head of a school system knew only in a gen- 
eral way what some other head of a similar school system was doing, 
what his problems were and how he was meeting them, there was 
small chance of his giving professional service based on exact knowl- 
edge of his special field. But such knowledge could be had; and within 
ten years from the time when the first attempt was made, so much had 
been accumulated that a scientific ordering of the materials became a 
necessity in the training of school superintendents. Note, for exam- 
ple, the scope of such a course as given in one teachers college:  
-P-A-G-E-130
122 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
“State responsibility for local education—the constitution of state, city, and 
county boards of education and their relation to other governmental bodies—the 
organization of the administrative and supervisory corps, with particular refer- 
ence to line and staff organization—the organization of school systems; elemen- 
tary schools, including a consideration of the platoon or duplicate school plan, 
departmental teaching and special classes; the junior high school; the senior 
high school, special and comprehensive; continuation schools, vocational schools, 
adult education—the curricula—the development of courses of study—supervi- 
sion—pupil accounting—the continuing census and attendance service—school 
health administration and physical education—statistical methods applied to the 
problems of administration—measuring the results of teaching—business admin- 
istration, including accounting, budget making, selection, purchase, and distribu- 
tion of textbooks and supplies—the training, selection, tenure, salaries, promo- 
tions, and pensions of teachers—building and equipment, including plans and 
specifications, scoring the plant, building program, financing capital outlays, budg- 
eting, equipment—relation of superintendent to the community, including public- 
ity, parent-teacher associations.” 
The same methods applied to other fields yielded equally good re- 
sults. The history of education, for example, quickly ran into big 
textbooks and important treatises. Monroe’s Cyclopedia of Education 
was a monumental work characteristic of the period. Methods of 
teaching the several school subjects were presented in a new form, 
not so much as hitherto the output of one practitioner, but more the 
combined experience of many masters. Textbooks, particularly those 
for elementary schools, began to be both more numerous and more 
comprehensive. In a word, the break with tradition was well under 
way, and the primary cause was the substitution of the “look around” 
for the “backward look.” 
INTENSIVE STUDY AND INVESTIGATION 
The dictum once prevalent in learned circles, that all that a teacher 
needs in teaching is a knowledge of his subject, has been controverted 
by the work of the great scholars themselves. The acquisitions to 
knowledge of any subject within a generation, to say nothing of what 
was known before, are so extensive and of such far-reaching signifi- 
cance that no one, however scholarly, would venture to apportion off- 
hand those parts or phases of the subject best suited to particular 
ages or groups of learners. The selection of materials of instruction, 
their arrangement into courses of study, and the combination of 
courses of study into curricula, have become the subject of intensive 
study and investigation. Coincident with the advance of science and 
an inevitable result of scientific curiosity, scientific method was di- 
rected to the mind itself. The new psychology made possible the com- 
parison of mind with mind, and the testing and measuring of intellec- 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
Second Day,—Russell 123 
tual capacity and achievement. Research in this direction has led to 
a revolution in methods of classification and promotion in our lower 
schools, and has raised questions never before asked as to what knowl- 
edge can best be acquired by some individuals and the extent to which 
the education of such individuals is possible. It has raised questions, 
too, of how children learn, and of the obstacles to be overcome due to 
individual differences. Most of these questions still remain unan- 
swered and await the findings of patient investigation of a most ex- 
acting kind. 
THE LOOK AHEAD IN EDUCATION 
The immediate result of this enormous accumulation of materials 
of instruction, of information concerning school organization and 
management, and of new knowledge concerning the processes of learn- 
ing and the limitation of education, is the imperative necessity of 
knowing how best to use the riches at our command. Neither the 
“backward look” nor the “look around” can furnish sufficient enlight- 
enment. Obviously the questions must be raised: What are we going 
to do with these means and instruments?) What is education for, any- 
way? Hence, the “look ahead” comes to mark the next step forward. 
In the training of teachers it forces us to define the particular duties 
and obligations that novices must meet in their professional service 
and to select the materials and methods that will best equip them for 
their prospective positions. 
On one point I want to make myself clear. The break with tradi- 
tion that marks the steps taken in the recent advance toward a sci- 
ence and art of education does not mean a break with the scholarly 
ideals and scholarly standards of the past. Our progress is up a wind- 
ing stair. The higher we mount, the better view we get of what lies 
spread before us. Nowhere is this fact more patent than in the field 
of academic instruction. Improved methods of school administration 
and the applications of scientific methods in measuring results do not 
make less important the scholarly command of the materials of in- 
struction. On the contrary, they call for better scholarship, a wider 
outlook, and a more precise acquaintance with the significant facts that 
should be presented to learners. If ever there was a time when teach- 
ers could rest content with what some textbook or treatise contained, 
that time has passed. The teacher of to-morrow needs not only a 
scholarly grasp of his subject beyond the reach of his students, but he 
needs also the ability to pick and choose from the whole range of his 
knowledge that which will best serve his purposes in teaching. In 
addition to the best that his academic training has given him, he needs 
preéminently that special training which should enable him to select
-P-A-G-E-132
124 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
the materials best fitted to the abilities of his students at any particu- 
lar stage of advancement. And the more profound his academic 
scholarship, the greater the need of this specialized knowledge. 
SELECTIVE SCHOLARSHIP IN THE TEACHER 
Of all the significant features in the trend of the times, I regard 
this emphasis upon selective scholarship as one of the most important. 
It must be made a prime essential in the professional training of 
teachers. It is not an academic job, and we have no right to expect 
academic institutions, either high schools or colleges, to do it. The 
development of courses in so-called “professionalized subject-matter” 
is the business of normal schools and teachers colleges. This is so 
obviously true that no one questions either its propriety or necessity 
in the training of teachers for vocational schools, but it should be con- 
sidered no less proper and necessary in the training of teachers of 
academic subjects. But let us not delude ourselves in thinking that 
review courses in academic subjects meet these requirements. They 
are merely devices of Satan to conceal ignorance. Selective scholar- 
ship, this systematizing and ordering of knowledge for specific ends, 
is the intellectual background for every kind of professional effort. 
The teacher must have it if he would attain to professional standing. 
EXPERIMENTATION AND SELECTION 
A further consequence of the break with tradition and the resulting 
increase of knowledge in our field has been the attention given to ex- 
perimentation with courses of instruction and school curricula. When 
available means and materials are too great for a particular purpose, 
manifestly some selection must be made. But how pick out the best? 
The good old way—and it was good so far as it went—was to rely on 
some genius to make a textbook or demonstrate his theories in a 
school of his own making. The life of some textbooks proves beyond 
doubt that their authors were geniuses, and the influence of some 
schools shows the touch of a master hand. The need of such books and 
such masters is not likely soon to disappear. But we are coming 
nowadays to the belief that progress can be hastened by putting to 
the test of actual use the proposals of even master minds. So long 
as masters differ and their theories lead to divergent practices, so 
long is there a chance that the better way may be found by trial under 
controlled conditions. Hence, it happens that the making of courses 
of study and school curricula is passing from superintendents and 
principals to codperative committees, and the tendency is to make 
these committees widely representative of all public interests—wit-  
-P-A-G-E-133
  Second Day,—Russell 125 
ness the recent surveys of Latin and mathematics. The next step is 
to put the recommendations of experts to test in an experimental 
school, note what happens, check the results under other conditions, 
and arrive at conclusions in scientific fashion. In their methods of 
experimentation, Colonel Parker and John Dewey were closer to Pes- 
talozzi and Froebel than to Caldwell and Rugg, so rapidly have we 
moved in twenty-five years. 
In no phase of teacher training is the emphasis upon selection and 
experimentation more apparent than in the training of administrative 
officers. To quote again from the outlines of the course to which I 
have already referred: 
“This course for superintendents of schools presents the field of educational 
administration on the basis of an analysis of the work of this professional execu- 
tive. Problems which have actually occurred in the experience of superintendents 
of schools will be presented for the solution of students. The problems presented 
in this first course will be those most commonly occurring in the experience of a 
superintendent of schools, and will vary from those found in a small school sys- 
tem to those which must be met in the larger communities. When the solution 
of the problems of the superintendent demands the knowledge of the specialist in 
physical education, household arts, vocational education, religious education, the 
fine arts, or other school subjects, experts in these fields will offer their advice in 
the solution of the problems, and students will be encouraged to consult them.” 
In an advanced course in the same field the student is confronted 
with actual situations from which he must select definite problems 
and assemble the data necessary for their solution. Examples of 
tasks actually undertaken are the following: 
“The organization of two city school systems; both involving a complete 
change in the law with respect to the organization of the school systems, the selec- 
tion of the board of education, the financing of the schools; one of them the devel- 
opment of a school building program; one of them suggestions for the revision of 
the curricula and the courses of study; both involving the problems of organiza- 
tion of the administrative and supervisory staff, business organization, attend- 
ance service, and the like. 
“The determination of the validity of certain administrative practices—for 
example, the fiscal independence of city boards of education, the legal status of 
the superintendent of schools, contractual relations involving capital outlay. 
“The derivation of a scientific measure of the need of support, the measure of 
differences of groups of school systems with respect to certain qualities, the devel- 
opment of a score card for evaluating the records of school systems. 
“The development of a method for distributing state school funds; the organi- 
zation of a state teachers’ association for effective participation in the development 
of a more efficient school system; the relative efficiency of one-teacher and con- 
solidated schools throughout a state in order to determine how far the program 
of consolidation should be carried; budgeting equipment for a four-year high
-P-A-G-E-134

school; the present status and the control that should be developed in interscho- 
lastic athletics; the ventilation of school buildings, including a study of the pres- 
ent practices and costs in the light of experimental research; the derivation of 
mathematical formule for the forecasting of school population and determination 
of building programs; absence and illness of teachers, with an attempt to deter- 
mine the causes operating to produce them.” 
AIM IN EDUCATION 
Herbert Spencer raised the question: “What knowledge is of most 
worth?” That question must be asked by every one who would use 
knowledge for specific ends. Selection implies choice according to 
some criterion of excellence. The evaluation of the means and mate- 
rials of instruction presupposes some aim in education worth striving 
for. The break with tradition in school procedure has not only forced 
us into making choice of what shall be used, but it will presently com- 
pel us to determine what are our aims in education. It was formerly 
taken for granted that the immediate purpose of schooling was to 
secure skill in the use of certain tools—the three R’s in the elemen- 
tary grades, the rudiments of Latin, Greek, and mathematics in the 
secondary field, ete—and that the ultimate end was the development 
of power through formal discipline of the intellectual faculties. It 
was assumed that these skills and powers once developed would be 
used for the common good. Experience has shown that power uncon- 
trolled and undirected is a dangerous asset—as dangerous to the indi- 
vidual as to society. Hence the growing demand that these forces— 
forces vastly more important to the welfare of mankind than any 
other force in the world—be harnessed and directed in beneficent 
channels. 
Character building was by no means neglected under the old order, 
but the school was not held responsible for the behavior of its output 
in later life. That was preéminently the duty of the home and the 
church. Great numbers of our people still hold to this view. To them 
the public school is merely a support to other agencies which can bet- 
ter shape the careers of oncoming generations. An increasing num- 
ber of our people, however, believe that what is done in school can 
shape the life conduct of its students, and that the public school, sup- 
ported by the public, should not subordinate its interests to the inter- 
ests of any sect or group or faction within the body politic. Thus it 
happens that a new problem has been injected into the controversy 
over the proper aims of education. 
In the training of teachers we cannot avoid this controversy. Ma- 
terials must be adapted to instruction on successive school levels, 
courses of study and curricula must be arranged, textbooks must be   
 
-P-A-G-E-135
Second Day,—Russell 127 
written, methods of teaching must be fitted to the abilities and capaci- 
ties of students, the extra-curricular activities of the school must be 
determined ; but not one step in any of these directions can be taken 
intelligently without recourse to some guiding principle that finds its 
justification in a rational view of the aims of education. 
FURTHER RESEARCH NEEDED 
The splendid results of research in the intellectual field are a chal- 
lenge to similar investigation of the emotional and volitional life. 
Somewhere in this field lies hidden the clue to educational aims and 
ideals and to the processes that make for desired ends. Meantime 
we are dependent upon empirical data and are swayed by selfish whims. 
Success seems to be rated by some parents in terms of money-making. 
The college sets metes and bounds to the process of acquiring culture 
and social rank. The church prescribes the type of school that leads 
to salvation along denominational routes. The state wants healthy, 
self-supporting, patriotic citizens, and makes compulsory the school- 
ing provided by lay boards. The eclectic, with faith in variety, says 
that any kind of instruction is good, provided it is well given. The 
individualist advocates freedom of teaching and freedom of learn- 
ing, and points to Athens as the historic example of the progress that 
is possible when personality is given free rein. Another philosopher 
sees what became of Athens after it reached its zenith, and, therefore, 
prefers the longevity of a Chinese civilization, even though it be on a 
lower level. Of what avail, he asks, if one does gain the whole world, 
if in the end he shall lose his own soul? These are but instances of 
points of view which confuse and confound the student of education. 
While exposing our ignorance, I do not deny the value of experience 
and tradition in evaluating the means and materials of instruction, 
nor do I underrate the wisdom of the ages in fixing the aims of educa- 
tion. But I remind myself that the wisdom of the ages once upheld 
the geocentric theory of the universe. The new order made no change 
in the facts of the case, but it did change men’s way of thinking and 
acting with respect to those facts. Hence, while I do not delude my- 
self into believing that education will ever become an exact science, I 
am morally certain that some of the processes of moral and social 
education will be scientifically determined. The facts will not be 
changed, but we shall look at them from a different point of view. 
There will still be children and materials of instruction, schools and 
teachers, the family, the church, and the state; but a scientific deter- 
mination of measurable facts will provide a rational basis for experi-
-P-A-G-E-136
  128 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
mentation with ways and means of securing better results from these 
prime factors in education. 
THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE 
Teacher training has come to be something more than routine drill 
on school subjects and methods of teaching. Like other types of voca- 
tional preparation, it aims to equip the novice with the tools of his 
trade and to give him the ability to use them. Considered as admis- 
sion to a profession, there is the further obligation to provide ade- 
quate scholarship, both general and selective, and a philosophy of life 
that functions in service. The highest ideal of professional training 
is that the practitioner shall have the ability and the will to be self- 
directive. In no profession is there either better opportunity for, or 
more need of, advancement. The field now opened up is enormous; 
it borders on every other field of human endeavor; across it are paths 
leading to every occupation in which men engage; within it are the 
resources that make for the well-being of mankind and the advance- 
ment of civilization. How wisely this field shall be tilled, with what 
vision its resources shall be used, is primarily an obligation resting 
upon our schools of education and teachers colleges. I have faith 
enough in the staff and students of these institutions, as I know them, 
to predict that what has been accomplished in my time is but an 
earnest of what they will achieve in their time. 
THE INFLUENCE OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES IN 
EDUCATION ON TEACHER-TRAINING 
INSTITUTIONS 
  
CHARLES HUBBARD JUDD

On August 14, 1928, the inhabitants of the little village of Con- 
cord, Vt., gathered with their neighbors to celebrate, by means of a 
parade and appropriate historical exercises, the establishment of the 
first American training school for teachers. One hundred years be- 
fore the date of this celebration the Rev. Samuel Read Hall had opened 
in Concord a private school organized for the purpose of preparing 
teachers for the common schools. The courses of study which were 
administered in this first normal school were chiefly reviews of the

subjects which were to be taught to the children, together with a few 
general comments on the best ways of dealing with these subjects. 
During the latter part of the century which has passed since the 
establishment of this first normal school, institutions for the training 
of teachers have rapidly increased in number. Up to 1870 the num- 
ber of these institutions was not large, nor was the equipment great 
in the cases of the few which were in existence. We are told by the 
Commissioner of Education of the United States that the annual ex- 
penditure for normal schools in the United States amounted in 1870 
to $202,000. Since 1870 there has been a steady and rapid advance. 
During the last year something more than $27,000,000 was spent 
on the annual upkeep of teacher-training institutions in this country. 
This latter figure does not include the expenses of departments of 
education which are maintained by colleges and universities. 
The great expansion of teacher-training institutions is a part of a 
general movement for the enlargement of American education. There 
has been so rapid a growth in the schools of the United States and 
there has been such an extension of the curriculum that the simpler 
methods which were adequate in 1870 and the relatively meager pro- 
fessional training of teachers will no longer suffice. 
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF CURRICULA 
Not only has there been an increase in the number and equipment 
of normal schools; there has also been a very radical change in the 
content of instruction. Before we take up the details of these changes 
in the methods of teaching and the materials taught in these schools, 
it may be well to call attention to one of the major facts in the history 
of teacher-training institutions which has been of very great influence 
in determining the evolution of their curricula. The earliest normal 
institutions were of the general grade of secondary schools. If one 
reads the history of the first normal schools of. Massachusetts, New 
York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, one finds that the maturity of 
the students and the general grade of work carried on in these insti- 
tutions were distinctly below the college level. These early normal 
classes were, for the most part, maintained in academies and semi- 
naries. So deep-seated is the distinction in the eastern part of the 
United States between teacher-training courses and the courses given 
in colleges and universities that it is only very recently that the East- 
ern colleges have given credit for normal courses or have themselves 
dealt in any wise with the subjects that are necessary for the prepara- 
tion of teachers. It is not until one crosses the Allegheny Mountains,
-P-A-G-E-140
  130 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
going westward, that the teacher-training institutions begin to rank 
with other higher institutions. 
Last year the University of Iowa celebrated the fiftieth anniversary 
of its Department of Education. This was established as a teacher- 
training enterprise in a university, and is in sharp contrast with the 
normal schools of secondary grade which are common in the eastern 
part of the United States. If one traces the history of normal edu- 
cation in such states as Michigan and Wisconsin, one finds that the 
teacher-training schools were in their earliest days regarded as parts 
of the higher educational system of the state. The University of 
Michigan, for example, treated the normal schools of that state as 
branches of the university, and in Wisconsin a dispute arose in the 
early days of the history of the state university because there was 
opposition within that institution to the maintenance of a division 
devoted to the training of elementary teachers. While the Wisconsin 
normal schools were for this reason separated from the state univer- 
sity and while the normal schools of Michigan have in later years been 
divorced from the state university, there still remains in both of these 
states a clear recognition of the fact that the teacher-training institu- 
tions are on a par with the first years of the university, so far as the 
maturity of the students and the level of intellectual work are con- 
cerned. 
This historical fact that the Western normal schools are branches 
of the university system rather than parts of the secondary-school 
system of the states has resulted in a general movement which is at 
the present time asserting itself very vigorously in all of the states 
for the conversion of all normal schools into teachers colleges. It is 
not the purpose of this paper to enter into the merits of that move- 
ment, but it is germane to our general discussion to point out that 
with this emphasis upon the college aspect of organization in the nor- 
mal institutions there has come a very marked tendency to change the 
courses of instruction which are offered in these institutions to the 
level of general college or university work. 
REVIEWS OF ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Returning, then, to a discussion of the courses of study which have 
been historically characteristic of teacher-training institutions, we 
may once more refer to the fact that the earliest institutions were con- 
cerned chiefly with a review of those subjects which the teachers in 
preparation were expected to teach to the children. This early tra- 
dition of the normal schools has carried down to our modern times. 
There will be found in the teachers colleges and normal schools of
-P-A-G-E-141
  
Second Day,—Judd 181 
to-day a great many examples of review courses; and if one thinks of 
the county normal schools and teachers’ institutes which still appear 
in many parts of the country, one finds numerous cases where prac- 
tically the whole curriculum for the training of teachers is made up of 
these reviews. 
No one who has seen one of these review courses in operation can 
fail to be impressed with the fact that their authors have a certain 
justification for insisting that those who are going to teach should 
review the subjects with which they are to deal. It is certainly true 
that teachers who are about to take charge of classes in arithmetic 
very frequently need to go over once more the arithmetic which has 
for the most part been forgotten by them, especially when there has 
been a lapse between their study of the subject in the elementary 
schools and their present educational efforts. It is also true that 
most teachers in training have forgotten a great deal of their geogra- 
phy, to say nothing of spelling and grammar. 
On the other hand, an observer of one of these review courses is 
tempted to believe that a very large share of the review could be ef- 
fected without spending the time of the class in tedious recitations on 
very elementary material. One feels quite certain that mature stu- 
dents, of the type attending teacher-training institutions, ought to be 
able privately and at a relatively small expenditure of time to recan- 
vass elementary arithmetic, geography, and the other subjects with 
which children have to deal in the lower grades. 
OTHER CURRICULUM MATERIALS 
So obvious did it become in the course of the history of normal 
schools that review courses were not adequate to the training of 
teachers that we find gradually coming into the curricula of these 
institutions other subjects. In our own day the subjects which are 
most commonly added to these reviews are some form of psychology 
or child study, which shall give the teacher in training a knowledge 
of child nature, and courses in methods and classroom organization, 
in school law and school hygiene, and in history and philosophy of 
education. 
In addition to such courses, which may be called “strictly profes- 
sional,” there is a disposition to introduce a number of subjects which 
are intended to cultivate the minds of the mature students them- 
selves rather than to prepare them directly for the business of teach- 
ing in school. In this list are to be included general courses in liter- 
ature and science and courses in higher mathematics and in history,
-P-A-G-E-142
  132 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
ancient and modern. These we may properly designate as academic 
courses. 
There is the greatest diversity in the practices of teacher-training 
institutions in respect to their emphasis on one or the other of these 
groups of courses. Such emphasis depends on the disposition of the 
head of the normal school; and this is, in turn, determined very often 
by local conditions. It is possible, for example, to find normal 
schools, situated in sparsely settled rural districts, which supply all 
of the opportunities which the region offers for the higher education of 
students. Such a normal school as this is very likely to stress the 
academic or college course, and the student population in such a school 
is likely to be made up in very large measure of those who have no 
intention of teaching, but are taking advantage of the opportunities 
afforded by a public institution for a higher education. A teachers 
college with this emphasis on academic courses is likely to excite some 
criticism on the part of those who see the necessity of devoting such 
funds as the state is willing to appropriate to teacher-training insti- 
tutions to the preparation of teachers for the elementary schools. 
There are other types of normal schools where the work is very 
elementary and where little or no attention is paid to the academic 
work such as was stressed in the first example referred to. Here re- 
view courses predominate. But review courses are very elementary, 
and they are coming to be thought of by normal-school people them- 
selves as of doubtful value in making up the general curriculum of 
the normal school. 
PROFESSIONAL COURSES IN NORMAL SCHOOLS 
Our particular interest at this time is centered upon the group of 
courses described by the general term “professional courses,” and it 
is at this point that a very distinct evolution has been going forward 
in recent years. Formerly these professional courses gave to the stu- 
dents certain general principles derived from the study of psychology 
and history of education and school law. Latterly there has been 
growing up a body of material which is distinctly the product of newer 
types of educational inquiry. One thinks, for example, of such mate- 
rial as that collected through tests in arithmetic or analyses of hand- 
writing or studies of the spelling vocabulary of pupils. These dis- 
tinctly educational studies are no longer to be classified as parts of the 
general science of psychology. They are direct attacks upon school 
problems, and have developed a technic of investigation which makes 
of them separate branches of social science.

THE RESULTS OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH 
When students in the normal schools learn how to teach spelling 
in these modern times, they must of necessity be introduced to the in- 
vestigations of Ayres and Jones and Horn and others who have ap- 
plied scientific methods to organization of the spelling curriculum. 
It has come to pass, therefore, that the normal schools find themselves 
concerned at the present time with a body of scientific material which 
is rapidly accumulating in quantity, and is so important in character 
for the professional training of teachers that it is beginning to re- 
place some of the older courses. There is no justification for the ordi- 
nary type of a review of spelling when the thousand words of Ayres’ 
spelling scale are available as materials of instruction and as exam- 
ples of scientific work in the field of education. 
Normal schools are somewhat conservative, however, even in the 
presence of this large body of new scientific material. One finds a 
great many very abstract courses in general psychology still included 
in the curriculum of normal schools. No one can successfully defend 
such courses except on the ground that generation after generation 
has become accustomed to them. No one will hold seriously that they 
are as productive for the training of teachers as some of the more 
recent studies in educational psychology. 
As conservatism gives way and new courses of a scientific type are 
imported into the teacher-training curriculum, another innovation 
appears which is probably the most typical fact in our modern normal 
schools. This is the participation in a productive way, by teacher- 
training institutions, in the development of the scientific materials 
which are to be taught to teachers in training. 
In the early days the normal schools were not always in sympathy 
with the science of education. The earliest efforts to establish such 
a science did not originate in the normal schools. In its first stages 
the science of education was critical of existing school practices and 
results. At that time normal-school teachers often joined with teach- 
ers in the elementary schools in what may be called a “vigorous de- 
fensive reaction.” 
During the decade between 1890 and 1900, which may be regarded 
as the earliest period of the scientific movement in education, there 
were a number of studies made of school processes and of the achieve- 
ments of students, which reflected very unfavorably on the methods 
then in use in the common schools of the United States. Against 
these the normal schools reacted with vigor and often with acrimony. 
Where it was not the critics of the schools who instituted scientific 
studies, it was very frequently the advanced students of human na- 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
134 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
ture, working in psychological laboratories and in special university 
departments of education, who first suggested the possibility of eval- 
uating work in scientific terms. Here again the workers very often 
found that they did not have the sympathy of the normal schols. 
The normal schools have in the course of time, however, found the 
scientific studies so fruitful, whether they came from critics or from 
university departments, that they have gradually introduced the ma- 
terial collected in scientific investigations into their courses of study. 
It is quite impossible, for example, at the present time to find any good 
normal school which does not introduce its students to the various 
tests which have been devised in arithmetic and spelling and reading, 
and in many instances the courses in the methods of teaching these 
subjects are made up very largely of discussions of the results of the 
scientific tests and laboratory analyses. 
Wherever scientific material of this sort has been introduced, it has 
rapidly replaced the early pronouncement on methods of teaching 
which grew out of the personal experience of instructors and lacked 
any sound basis in carefully tested results. 
Another reason which has contributed to the adoption of scientific 
studies in normal schools is that there is found to be enough general 
training in such studies so that the academic part of the normal cur- 
riculum can very properly be replaced by extended studies in the sci- 
ence of education. There is no reason why normal schools should not 
acquaint their students with the methods and results of the science of 
education and regard the course as adequate for college standing, 
rather than depart entirely from the field of the student’s interest as 
a teacher in training by insisting on a course in some natural science 
or higher mathematics. 
NEW MATERIALS OF INSTRUCTION 
With the professional work in the science of education thus satisfy- 
ing both the professional and the academic demands of the normal cur- 
riculum, there is coming about a readjustment in teacher-training 
institutions in the direction of a cultivation on a very large scale of a 
body of material which two decades ago was relatively unknown. 
In fact, we find that the faculties of normal schools are coming to 
recognize scientific work as part of their regular duties. They are 
themselves becoming active, creative workers in the field. They fre- 
quently carry on scientific studies not only in the practice schools 
directly connected with the normal schools, but also in the school sys- 
tens to which they send their pupils. The conduct of tests and of 
studies of the curriculum which naturally follow the tests are so sig-
-P-A-G-E-145
  Second Day,—Judd 135 
nificant for the territory in which the normal school is located that 
normal teachers are more and more being called upon to participate 
in the progressive educational management of the schools about them. 
The result of all this is that the science of education is increasingly 
dominating the normal schools and modifying the character of these 
institutions. Especially in the Middle States and in the West, where 
the normal schools have been from the earliest days of their history 
regarded as higher institutions, there has been a very rapid develop- 
ment of this tendency to treat the teacher-training institutions as 
research centers. 
Wherever a normal-school teacher has become interested in studies 
of the type here under discussion, it always follows that the class work 
in the normal school is modified in a direction which comports with 
the teacher’s own scientific work. In not a few instances the more 
mature normal-school students participate in the scientific work of the 
members of the faculty. 
TRAINING IN METHODS OF RESEARCH 
There is no reason why the future development of normal schools 
should not emphasize, even more than is now the case, scientific work 
in education. Professional schools in other fields are becoming in- 
creasingly centers, not only of instruction, but also of scientific inves- 
tigation. The best medical schools of the country are not only pre- 
paring doctors; they are also making investigations in physiology and 
therapeutics which are of very great importance in the cultivation of 
the professional literature of medicine. The law schools are not only 
training young lawyers; they are also studying the problem of sim- 
plifying and perfecting both the codes of laws with which these law- 
yers will have to deal and the modes of administering the laws which 
are common in the courts. Schools of engineering are producing 
bodies of material which will carry forward the profession for which 
they prepare. The normal school is rapidly developing, and should be 
encouraged to develop in the direction of professional scientific work 
until ultimately it can stand on a par with the other professional 
schools. 
This much-to-be-desired evolution of teacher-training institutions 
is being promoted by the codperation and example of colleges and uni- 
versities which have in recent years been approaching the problems 
of education in a scientific and practical way, and are themselves un- 
dertaking on a rapidly increasing scale the task of preparing teachers 
for service in the schools. 
The institution whose anniversary we are celebrating to-day has 
   
-P-A-G-E-146
ee eee ee ee 
136 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
had a large influence in the southern part of the United States and 
throughout all of the states of the Union because it has made of itself 
an institution for the training of teachers. This it has done at the | 
same time that it has developed the practice of research in education, 
making of itself an influential center for creative scientific work. 
The spirit of creative science undoubtedly tends to improve the in- 
struction which is given to teachers in preparation, and it certainly 
leads to a new type of attitude toward all the problems of education. 
It carries normal instruction to a level which can be described as 
truly professional. 
If there is in each region of the United States a strong disposition 
at a number of the leading centers to emphasize scientific methods 
and scientific results in education, all of the neighboring institutions 
will feel the influence of these leading examples. This will undoubt- 
edly mean a new type of organization of some of the normal schools. 
I shall venture to indicate in detail one or two of the reforms which 
in my judgment must come. 
A REDUCED TEACHING LOAD 
One of the major criticisms that must be lodged against our nor- 
mal schools in past years is the extravagant program of instruction 
which has been required of teachers in these institutions. The pro- 
gram of instruction has in many cases been modeled on the program 
of the elementary school. Normal-school teachers have been expected 
to give instruction twenty-five and even thirty periods in a week. 
Where such an excessive demand as this is made, there is no margin 
left for constructive work; and the state and the institution requiring 
such a program make it perfectly clear that their attitude with regard 
to teacher-training is the older attitude, that all one needs to do in 
order to train teachers is to review the courses which these teachers 
themselves will have to give to the children. 
Higher institutions of learning have found it desirable to reduce the 
teaching program to twelve hours per week or even as low as eight 
periods a week. They make, however, a demand upon their officers 
corresponding directly to this limited program of instruction. They 
ask every member of their staff to have some share in the creation 
of scientific material, and in this way to bring into the institution the 
spirit of investigation and production. 
Normal schools can well afford to cut in half the program which 
has commonly been required of their teachers. They ought then to 
insist that these teachers shall influence the school systems of the ter- 
ritory in which the normal school is located by participating actively  
-P-A-G-E-147
  
Second Day,—Judd 137 
  in the organization of instruction in all of these systems. This does 
not mean merely or primarily that extension work shall be organized 
on a larger scale. It means rather that the schools of the territory 
should be turned into laboratories where educational experiments can 
be tried out and tested by competent investigators who themselves 
are dealing constantly with the problems of preparing teachers for 
these schools. 
THE CENTERS OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF EDUCATION 
There is another consideration which may properly be urged in this 
connection. It was pointed out in an earlier paragraph that the dis- 
position has arisen in a great many normal schools to overemphasize 
academic courses. This disposition is due in part to a desire on the 
part of normal-school faculties to secure recognition for their institu- 
tions which shall be equal to the recognition now given to colleges 
and universities. In so far as the administration of general academic 
courses in normal schools is taking these institutions away from the 
professional purposes for which they were first organized, the move- 
ment is to be deprecated. On the other hand, in so far as the name 
“teachers college” is intended to imply a spirit of scientific research 
and advanced work in education, the evolution of normal institutions 
into higher institutions should be emphatically encouraged. 
If normal schools and teachers colleges can be made to recognize 
clearly the possibilities of devoting the attention of their faculties 
and students to advanced scientific work in their proper fields, there 
ought to be no limit to the support given by the states to these insti- 
tutions. They can economize human life in the elementary schools 
and high schools of the states, if they will contribute through scientific 
methods to the improvement of education methods and education or- 
ganization. 
The normal schools ought to become centers from which legislatures 
will draw suggestions as to the best legal methods of organizing 
schools; normal schools ought to become centers to which administra- 
tive officers of neighboring towns and cities and rural districts will 
look for codperation in reorganization of the curriculum and in scru- 
tiny of the results produced in their school systems. Teachers ought 
to learn to regard normal schools as centers for advice on difficult 
educational problems. When all of these larger functions are ade- 
quately served by normal schools, the states can well afford to treat 
them as generously as the states now treat schools of agriculture 
which give scientific material to the inhabitants engaged in that fun- 
damental industry. Normal schools ought to be supported, and will  
-P-A-G-E-148
  138 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
be supported as soon as they become productive in this larger sense, 
at the same level as schools of engineering or schools of commerce or 
administration. However, it should be clearly recognized by all who 
are concerned with the training of teachers: that adequate support 
can be demanded and will be granted to colleges and departments of 
education only when the distinctly professional character of the work 
being carried on by these institutions is made clear to the state in 
which they are located. This means a reduction of trivial review 
courses, a proper adjustment of the claims of strictly academic work, 
and a vigorous development of the science of education.

  PROCEEDINGS OF THE THIRD DAY   
The features of this day’s program were contributed by alumni 
who are at this time vigorous leaders in Southern education, thought, 
and life. Addresses of the morning on educational subjects were fol- 
lowed by the luncheon, which took on the aspect of an alumni reunion 
and continued into the afternoon, with exercises intimate and per- 
sonal to the Peabody family. It is always a pleasure to see and hear 
the sons and daughters of Peabody praising each other and pledging 
loyalty to Alma Mater; but even so they never forget the significance 
of their position as guardians of the Peabody name and bearers of the 
Peabody banner. 
Peabody graduates have disseminated the Peabody ideals wherever 
they have gone. As alumni en masse, they have done notable work for 
public education, and many brilliant individuals have been and are 
outstanding leaders as heads of state and city school systems, as pres- 
idents of normal schools, of colleges, and of universities, and as edu- 
cational statesmen. Those who have gone into other professions have 
by the same high qualities achieved success there also. As envoys 
and ambassadors of the Peabody mission, they all have always spread 
the doctrine of universal education. It is still true of Peabody, as of 
all other organized agencies, that its existence in the last analysis 
must be judged and justified by its products—the individuals who 
submit to its discipline and respond to its culture. 
Peabody not only rests its hope of the future on its alumni, but is 
glad to justify its existence by the graduates and former students 
(a score of thousands) whom it has sent forth in the past fifty years. 
It is quite content to let the test be applied: 
“By their fruits ye shall know them.” 
PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH 
  
FRANK EVANS 
Superintendent of Schools, Spartanburg, S. C. 
  
fam very much honored by your invitation to address this impor- 
tant meeting. I am honored, too, in being permitted to speak on 
education in this grand old city of Nashville, where fifty years ago 
this college was founded. Its work is well known by all who have
-P-A-G-E-150
140 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
watched educational progress, and its influence has been felt in every 
Southern state. 
The American public-school system, as it is developed to-day, was 
not introduced into the South until after the Civil War. It did not 
become popular here till about forty-five years ago. Prior to that 
time parents sought for their children an education that would “fit 
them for such and such a position in life,” and every one interested 
was willing to pay for it from his own purse. The children of the 
poor were generally neglected. 
In this discussion I shall regard my own state, South Carolina, as 
a typical Southern state; in some respects, perhaps extreme. 
In 1795, Francis Marion, making a plea for popular education, 
prayed: “God preserve our Legislature from penny wit and pound 
foolishness. What! Keep a nation in ignorance rather than vote a 
little of their own money for education!” This entreaty fell upon 
deaf ears. 
In 1835, Governor George McDuffie commended the Legislature for 
its aid to the South Carolina College; but he severely rebuked that 
body for its constant neglect of the primary schools, in which “a 
great part of the community obtain all the instruction they ever re- 
ceive at school.” Continuing, he said: “There is no field of exertion, 
public or private, in which the duties of the parent and the patriot 
ean be so usefully and so honorably blended as in the improvement, 
superintendence, and inspection of the primary schools; and it is to 
be hoped that every enlightened citizen will regard himself as a trustee 
of these elementary seminaries and a guardian of the children edu- 
cated in them.” 
Who was George McDuffie? He was born on the Georgia side of 
the Savannah River. Across the river from his humble home was 
the plantation of Patrick Calhoun, the father of John C. Calhoun. 
The story is told that on one afternoon Mr. Calhoun was taking a 
ride on the Georgia side of the river, when he noticed a young tow- 
headed boy “minding the calf” while his mother milked the cow, and 
he bade them, “Good evening!” ‘Howdy do, mister!’ the boy re- 
sponded. “Don’t you think,” said Mr. Calhoun, “that a young man 
of your size might take off his hat when he speaks to a gentleman?” 
His reply was: “Yes, sir; and if you’ll come and hold this calf, I’ll take 
my hat off.” 
Mr. Calhoun admired the lad’s spirit, and he took him to his own 
home, sent him to school and to college. In college he was the bright- 
est and most successful student in his class. He early showed skill 
and strength in public speaking. After graduation he became a law- 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
  Third Day,—Evans 141 
yer and a member of the Legislature. Then he was sent to Congress 
and finally to the Senate. He was regarded as one of the most gifted 
speakers in the Senate. Whenever it became known in Washington 
that George McDuffie was to make a speech, the galleries of the Sen- 
ate Chamber were crowded with people eager to see and hear him. 
He helped to make Texas one of the states of the Union. In conse- 
quence of a serious wound received in a pistol duel, he had to retire 
from public life. In those days men fought duels, but they did not 
shoot in the dark from behind masks. 
Mr. Calhoun discovered George McDuffie. Otherwise history never 
would have known him. How many George McDuffies lived and died 
in obscurity, we have no means of knowing; how many George Mc- 
Duffies had their powerful intellects warped by their hopeless sur- 
roundings and turned in the wrong direction, doing their state harm 
instead of good, we can only conjecture. 
Notwithstanding his magnificent appeal, Governor McDuffie could 
not induce his state to break with the past. His Legislature remained 
inactive. 
Let us pass over the Civil War period and the “Reconstruction” 
days, worse than the war itself. 
In 1860, South Carolina, a small agricultural state, ranked third in 
wealth and fifth in college endowment in the United States; but in 
1870 it ranked thirtieth in wealth, and every college except one was 
closed. 
In 1914, South Carolina led the South and ranked second in the 
United States in cotton manufacture. In hydroelectric power, 
South Carolina then ranked second in the list of the Southern states. 
In public education, if you would only turn the column of states of 
the Union upside down, South Carolina would rank second on the list. 
Let us not forget, however, that South Carolina ranks third in the 
number of congressional medals for heroism in the World War. This 
little Southern state, of one and a half millions of people, stands third 
only to New York, with ten and a half millions, and Illinois, with six 
and a half millions. Certainly there is some kind of efficiency inherent 
in our people. There is, at least, no doubt of their patriotism. 
The founding of Peabody Normal College, in 1875, marked a new 
era in Southern education. It threw more light upon the responsibil- 
ities of the state. Every one agrees now that the state should provide 
an education cheap enough for the poorest and good enough for the 
richest of our people. We have learned from a bitter experience that 
the integrity of the state must rest upon the character of the men who 
are not in an official position. Therefore, the great task before us is
-P-A-G-E-152
  142 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
to raise the average of intelligence of all the people. This is our only 
safety. 
In the old days we had in our colleges and in some of the noted 
academies of that time distinguished educators—educational philoso- 
phers—but there was a lack of educational statesmen. The primary 
teachers had no professional training. For emphasizing the neces- 
sity of an intelligent citizenship, for the state school system, and for 
the democratic character of the free public school, the South is in- 
debted to Peabody College. 
Peabody College established a limited number of scholarships for 
students of ability in the Southern states upon the condition that they 
obligate themselves to teach for a definite period. These scholar- 
ships were eagerly sought after by young men and young women of 
superior intelligence. “The school was established for the one pur- 
pose of training teachers for all the states, and its influence was far- 
reaching on education in that region.” 
The Peabody graduates have not only taught in the schools; they 
have been active in organizing associations for the purpose of dis- 
cussing the ideals, plans, and administration of public education; 
they have afforded the communities in which they worked the advice 
and experience of professional teachers; they have secured favorable 
representation of educational interests in the Legislature, and have 
influenced public opinion in that direction; they have raised the qual- 
ifications and status of teachers, and have improved the condition of 
education in the country. This, in short, has been the influence of 
Peabody College on elementary education in the South. 
The task before us now is to organize a system of public education 
free from political influence. So long as educational policies are for- 
mulated by party leaders, and as much for the purpose of securing 
the votes of ignorant citizens as for meeting the needs of future citi- 
zens, the opinions of the ablest men of the state cannot have due 
weight in public affairs. 
The greatest concern of any community, of any state or nation, is 
the education of the rising generation. If you cannot reform grown 
people, you may let them go their way to ruin. They will hurt only 
themselves. But if their children are neglected, if the coming gen- 
eration has no mental and moral training, the country will swarm 
with vile and worthless people. 
If you are going to do anything permanent for the average man, 
you have got to begin with him before he isa man. The chances of 
success lie in working with the child and not with the man. The best 
money spent by any community is that spent for schools. Education  
-P-A-G-E-153
Third Day,—Evans 143 
is the great money-maker—not by extortion, but by production. Ed- 
ucation is the cause and not the effect of all substantial prosperity. 
Progressive communities do not wait until they get rich to build 
schools. They build schools to get rich. Money spent for education 
is neither a charity nor a sacrifice. It is an investment—an invest- 
ment which yields greater returns in hard times than it does in pros- 
perous times. 
The state maintains the right to tax all the people for the education 
of all the people. Our wealthy men cheerfully pay this school tax for 
the purpose of securing and maintaining a high order of citizenship, 
that the town or community may be a safer and pleasanter place to live 
in. The business man regards it as a good investment, although he 
may have no children of his own to educate. 
An ignorant and poor man who has a bright, healthy boy may say 
that he alone is responsible for the training of that boy—if his boy 
should grow up an anarchist or a criminal, it is his own affair. And 
when the boy does become a criminal, whose affair is it then? The 
man of means who cheerfully paid a special tax to train that boy for 
something, in order that he might become a help and not a burden to 
the community, is forced to pay an additional tax for the expense of 
police officers, criminal courts, and prisons—for restraints and pun- 
ishments. It costs five times as much legally to kill a man as it does 
to educate one. 
Every child in the South has a right to an education, but the pa- 
thetic part of the matter is that he cannot enforce that right for him- 
self. As things are now, our children are not yet getting a fair chance 
to become moral men; at least, they have not an equal chance with 
children of other states. Who are responsible? Weak legislators, 
timid teachers, and preachers, who have failed to educate public opin- 
ion in the right direction. Our worst enemies are often our pretended 
friends. 
There are serious defects in our attendance law. Naturally the 
laws were not effective in any state at first—say, fifty years ago. But 
now all the amendments which experience proved necessary have been 
made, and compulsory education—taken for granted in other states— 
including attendance officers, permanent censuses, and penalties, is 
provided for. It should be fully enforced. The attendance officer is 
the crux of the situation. A permanent census, card indexed, in the 
principal’s office, is also necessary. When the law is violated, find the 
man and punish him. We grow tired of hearing certain abuses con- 
demned and not having the condemnation followed by a list of names 
of the persons who are guilty of them. You cannot punish crowds or
-P-A-G-E-154
  144 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
corporations, but you can punish individuals. Who should report 
these offenders? Teachers and attendance officers. Magistrates 
should punish them—not by a warning or suspended sentence, but by 
actual fine or imprisonment. This puts an end to opposition to send- 
ing children to school. 
In conclusion, if you will pardon me, I shall relate a bit of personal 
experience. A few years ago the University of South Carolina con- 
ferred upon me an honorary degree. I was very proud to get this 
recognition of my services to the state from the old university where 
my father graduated eighty-six years ago. The honor was unex- 
pected, and I scarcely knew how to wear it at first. And some time 
later the local board of education named a handsome high school for 
me. I was deeply sensible of that honor also. 
But, a while ago, I met a young girl coming out of one of the ele- 
mentary schools. ‘“Good-by, Mr. Evans,” she said, politely, when she 
saw me; “I’m going home now.” 
“Why are you going home?” I asked. 
“Well, I was fourteen years old yesterday, and daddy says I got to 
go to work now.” 
“Why,” I exclaimed, “I will see your father and ask him to let you 
come on to school.” 
“Tt ain’t no use,” she replied. “Dad never did want me to come, 
and he said as soon as ever I was fourteen he was going to put me in 
the mill; and he has done got a place for me, and I am going to work 
after dinner.” 
“But, Mr. Evans,” she continued, impetuously yet shyly, “I’m glad 
you made daddy and them send me to school. You put me in the first 
grade, and you told me how if I worked hard you would put me ahead; 
and you let me skip the second grade. Now I’m ’most through the 
third grade, and I can read and write, and I have wrote letters to my 
brother over in France. And I sure do thank you, Mr. Evans.” 
I am deeply sensible of the honor done me by the citizens of Spar- 
tanburg in naming their high school for me, and I appreciate the 
honorary degree from the State University; but the unexpected and 
sincere expression of gratitude from that fourteen-year-old girl is 
dearer to me to-day than any distinction that could be offered me by 
any body of citizens, or any scholastic degree that could be conferred 
by any university. That the child had any education at all was a 
result that could have been obtained only through the public school. 
Nothing but the strong arm of the law could have made that igno- 
rant father send his child to school, perhaps even for a day. 
The five hundred thousand children in the South who do not now
-P-A-G-E-155
Third Day,—Evans, Ivy 145 
go to school were not born to grow up in ignorance and vice. They 
were born to be saved by the light of learning. If they are not saved, 
the fault will lie chiefly with selfish politicians... The thinking people 
are willing to place their children in school, where they can be trained 
to become a help and not a burden to the state. The unthinking par- 
ents must be made to do so. The fight is on, and it will continue until 
the victory is won. I have never for one moment doubted that this 
fight which I joined forty-two years ago would eventually be won. 
The welfare of the child is the highest law. 
“It is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these 
little ones should perish.” 
THE INFLUENCE OF GEORGE PEABODY COLLEGE 
FOR TEACHERS IN PUBLIC EDUCA- 
TIONAL LEADERSHIP 
  
H. M. IVY 
Superintendent of Schools, Meridian, Miss. 
  
In 1867 the trustees of the Peabody Education Fund selected Dr. 
Barnas Sears, at that time president of Brown University, as its 
agent in carrying out the purposes for which Mr. Peabody had en- 
dowed the fund. After studying the situation through visitation and 
consultation with prominent men in each state, Dr. Sears reported 
to the trustees that there were two essential things to be done: first, 
that free schools must be made available for all the people; second, 
that teachers must be prepared for these schools. 
1. FREE SCHOOLS FOR ALL THE PEOPLE 
Education was recognized by Franklin, Washington, Jefferson, and 
other founders of our republic as being absolutely necessary in a de- 
mocracy. None of these had in mind, however, the same conception of 
free schools for all the people that we hold now. To them it was 
necessary that the leadership in government should be in the hands 
of men trained in history and political science. Consequently in all 
the old states we find education given a definite political significance. 
Even antedating the educational programs of our political leaders, 
education was recognized as necessary in the preparation of ministers 
of the gospel, and hence it early became of religious significance. 
As a result of the political struggles between the Jeffersonian and 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
146 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
Hamiltonian schools, it became evident that not only must the leaders 
in a democracy be educated, but the voters as well. From 1835 to 
1875 a struggle was going on throughout our country to set up the 
free school, which should be open on an equal basis to all children. 
The “free school” is synonymous with our present term “public 
school,” though it was at first much more limited in its application, 
including only the elementary grades. By 1875, the date of the found- 
ing of Peabody College for Teachers, the free-school idea, if not 
the fact, had permeated every community, and was more or less firmly 
established, not only in the North, East, and West, but also in the 
South. 
Free schools for all the people, as understood and expressed by Dr. 
Sears, has been a growing idea. For a long time it contemplated only 
elementary schooling for those who sought it; but, developing beyond 
the elementary grades, our people are now calling for a free high- 
school education for all. 
At the time of the founding of Peabody College for Teachers there 
were in the entire United States fewer public high schools than there 
are at present in the State of Mississippi. 
The development of the free-school idea is a result of our having 
passed beyond the pioneer stage of development. So long as there 
were unlimited possibilities within the bounds of our republic for the 
individual to find free scope for his native ability, all he had to do 
when pressed by the competition of his equals or superiors was to 
move on to a new place. A hundred years ago our forefathers could 
secure for themselves the blessings of life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness by their own sturdy manhood, a worthy helpmeet as wife, 
an ax, and a gun. This spirit was later embodied in the advice of 
Horace Greeley: “Go West, young man, go West.” To-day it is 
scarcely possible for a troop of Boy Scouts seeking a place to camp to 
chop a sapling for a tent pole without hearing a challenge called: 
“Here, young fellow, what are you doing, cutting my timber?” As 
our population becomes denser and our living conditions more com- 
plex, we can no longer depend on native ability alone to make out of 
our boys and girls the kind of citizens necessary. Consequently we 
are each decade being confronted more and more with the necessity of 
enabling, through education, every individual to fit most acceptably 
into the scheme of life which society has already prepared for him. 
Just as the ideal of 1835, that an elementary education was neces- 
sary for all the people, developed into the ideal of 1875, of a high- 
school education for all the people, so has the latter developed until 
to-day we are confronted by the question as to whether each individ- 
 
-P-A-G-E-157

ual is not entitled to the highest development of which he is capable, 
even though it requires training through college and university. 
2. THE PREPARATION OF TEACHERS FOR THE SCHOOLS 
The hoary dictum, “Teachers are born, not made,” probably met the 
situation so long as the work to be done by the teacher was not com- 
plicated and the supply of “born” teachers did not run out. While 
schools were and are being taught in a desultory fashion by preach- 
ers, incipient physicians, lawyers, merchants, farmers, and others, it 
is not to be wondered at that many people of otherwise keen under- 
standing would believe such a dictum. The development of free 
schools for all the people calls for many teachers, much supervision, 
trained administration, large sums of money, and consequently en- 
lightened educational leadership. 
The American is gullible, but cannot be long fooled into parting fool- 
ishly with his money. Unless his schools are good, he will not pay 
for their support. To have good schools, good teachers are absolutely 
necessary. To be a good teacher, one must know the needs of the 
pupils, the content of what they are to be taught, and the best ways of 
applying this content to their individual needs. 
With the expansion of the schools, a professional group must be 
trained and developed to study the multiplying problems, to carry on 
the work of teaching and set a high standard of accomplishment. 
38. HOW IS PEABODY MEASURING UP TO THE TRUST PLACED 
IN HER HANDS? 
At the time that George Peabody College for Teachers was founded, 
the term “free schools” had frequently a somewhat sinister signifi- 
cance. Previous to the Civil War these schools had been largely oper- 
ated by charity, for children whose parents in some cases were re- 
quired to take the pauper’s oath. They were lineal descendants of 
the British “ragged schools,” and frequently so called in earlier days. 
Public free schools were in existence in practically all of the Southern 
states by 1875, but varied greatly, according to local conditions. By 
1880 a system of elementary education had been established, and was 
in operation in each of the Southern states, looking to Peabody for the 
preparation of teachers for these schools and the development of lead- 
ers for the several states. 
In the fifty years of her existence Peabody has sent out more than 
twenty thousand teachers, of whom the greater part are now active in 
the field. Of the recent graduates, one out of every nine is the prin- 
cipal of a high school or an elementary school; one out of every ten is 
   
-P-A-G-E-158
148 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
the supervisor of a city, county, or state system of schools; one out of 
every ten is a member of a college or university faculty; one out of 
every fifteen is a city or county superintendent; and one out of every 
four is an instructor in a normal school or teachers college. Thirty 
per cent of the students sent forth have become home-keepers, and 
seven per cent are in other positions and vocations. Approximately 
sixty-three per cent occupy positions of definite educational leader- 
ship, and this percentage is increasing rapidly rather than diminish- 
ing. Included in the seven per cent who have gone into other voca- 
tions, we find governors of states, judges of federal and state courts, 
and legislators, both state and federal. Wherever a development of 
importance occurs in the Southern educational field, somewhere in it 
may usually be traced, directly or indirectly, the influence of George 
Peabody College for Teachers. 
Established as a Southern institution, Peabody is becoming na- 
tional in its scope. Fifty per cent of the population of the United 
States live within a radius of five hundred miles from its doors. 
Thirty-two states and seven foreign countries were represented in its 
student body during 1923-24, four per cent of its enrollment during 
that session being drawn from states outside the South. Its alumni 
head some of the great educational foundations, departments of public 
education, state universities, and teachers colleges. Others are found 
in leading institutions of the North, East, and West. 
Whether acquired directly or indirectly, the influence of George 
Peabody College for Teachers may be found abroad in our land wher- 
ever the banner of educational development is unfurled. The institu- 
tion is nonsectarian, but deeply religious. On its campus and within 
its halls the Protestant, the Catholic, and the Jew mingle on equal 
terms, but are led to realize that the development of character, based 
upon ethical principles and definite responsibility to God, is one of the 
fundamental principles of all education. It is a private institution, 
whose endowment gives it freedom from the uncertainty of legislative 
appropriation and saves it from being restricted to state limits. But 
it holds aloft the torch of public education as of paramount importance 
to state and nation. It is located in the South and gives especial at- 
tention to the study of the educational problems of this region; but 
it is not sectional in thought, faculty, or student body. It adheres to 
the highest standards of academic accomplishment, but is thoroughly 
democratic. It has been in the forefront of the movement to raise 
elementary, secondary, and college standards in the South, but has 
never given adherence to any policy that would exclude any individ- 
ual from the highest development of which he was capable. It is the 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
Third Day,—Ivy, Class Gift 149 
Mecca toward which the educational leader turns for inspiration; the 
visible evidence, in the South, of America’s belief in education. It 
fosters the two discard vocations, teaching and farming, and demands 
for each, not offcasts and incapables, but the best blood and brains of 
our people in which to embody the highest training possible as fitness 
for the noble profession of teaching. The highest intelligence and 
the fullest training are demanded in our educational leaders. Pea- 
body has encouraged this ideal in the past and will tolerate nothing 
less in the future. 
CLASS GIFT 
  
On Friday morning, just after the address by Dr. Ivy, a feature not 
listed on the official program came as a surprise. It was then that 
Mr. Thomas M. Foote, candidate for the A.M. degree in June, came 
forward and as chairman of the Class Gift Committee presented 
$101,000 of insurance policies to Mr. James E. Caldwell, of Nashville, 
chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees. 
Mr. Caldwell, in turn, presented the policies to Dr. Bruce R. Payne, 
president of the College. 
Mr. Foote’s speech of presentation voiced the enthusiasm, loyalty, 
and devotion of his fellows. Mr. Foote said: 
“Mr. CHAIRMAN, MR. PRESIDENT, LADIES, AND GENTLEMEN: 
“My friends, we are standing in the twilight of two eras. The past, 
with all of its magnificent achievement, which has been so fittingly 
commemorated here within these few days, sheds an afterglow on the 
horizon as it fast fades into our best and most sacred memories. 
Just out yonder the horizon is roseate with promise of the future—a 
promise that shall ripen into a glorious reality. From the horizon of 
the fading past we draw an inspiration that shall enable us to go 
forward with every assurance of success. 
“The classes of 1925 feel that they should share in this ripening 
future of our Alma Mater. Not only shall we strive to bring honor 
and renown to her by lives of service to humanity and to our several 
institutions in particular, but we desire to make a material contribu- 
tion to the upbuilding of our Alma Mater. With this idea in view, 
one hundred and one members of these classes have caused their lives 
to be insured in the sum of one thousand dollars each, with our Alma 
Mater as the beneficiary. 
“In behalf of the classes, Mr. Caldwell, I present to you, as chair- 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
150 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
man of the Executive Committee, these policies, to be held in trust for 
our Alma Mater. It is our hope that this trust shall be administered 
with the same zeal, the same painstaking care, the same wisdom, and 
the same vision as has been characteristic of the administration of all 
the affairs of the College heretofore. It is our prayer that when the 
summons comes to the members of your board to go out into the great 
beyond, God will raise up other men who shall carry on the work that 
you have so successfully fostered. 
“Will you for your board accept this trust?” 
This gift from the graduates of the classes of 1925 made a total of 
more than $400,000 of insurance policies from the graduates of the 
last four years, of which the College is the beneficiary. 
THE INFLUENCE OF GEORGE PEABODY COLLEGE 
FOR TEACHERS IN THE STATE PUBLIC- 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS 
  
W. F. BOND 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Mississippi 
  
A glance at a map of the United States will show that George Pea- 
body College for Teachers is centrally located and within easy reach 
of, and in direct touch with, approximately one-third of the entire 
area of the nation. Fifty millions of people, nearly one-half our entire 
population, live within five hundred miles, less than a day’s travel by 
rail, of Peabody College, situated as it is midway between the Great 
Lakes and the Gulf Coast. Perhaps no other great institution of 
learning occupies quite so strategic a position geographically. For 
many years, however, it stood at the gateway of the area it was to 
serve—that part of the South left most destitute by the War between 
the States. To get an idea of how great has been the service of Pea- 
body College, we must keep in mind how destitute, educationally and 
otherwise, this section really was when the College was founded. 
The report of the United States Commissioner of Education for the 
year 1870 contains the following statements: 
“Virginia is just putting a free-school system into operation, but encountering 
great difficulties in the lack of funds, the want of correct information of what 
a free-school system is, and in the absence of schoolhouses and qualified school 
officers and teachers.”
-P-A-G-E-161
Third Day,—Bond 151 
“North Carolina has been struggling for about two years to put a system of 
free schools into operation. . . . Many reasons combine to render the friends 
of education more fearful of defeat than hopeful of success.” 
“The friends of education in Tennessee, after seeing the school system put into 
operation and nearly 200,000 children enrolled, saw their work overthrown by 
reactionary sentiments, save in the cities of Nashville and Memphis, and the pro- 
visions reénacted in accordance with which the pauper schools of the days of 
slavery were conducted.” 
“Arkansas, encountering the evils common to the regions where slavery has 
been abolished, has secured a greater success than the majority of the Southern 
states.” 
“South Carolina, among the states having the largest percentage of illiteracy, 
is confident of final success in establishing free common schools.” 
“Florida, although under a most zealous and competent superintendent, now 
deceased, has hesitated in giving the greatest efficiency to the system sought to 
be established, and yet presents reasons for anticipating the general prevalence 
of free schools.” 
“Alabama, after the friends of education had put forth most strenuous efforts 
and secured the general opening of the schools, with hopes of permanent success 
in the establishment of free and universal education, now debates the question of 
advancing or retreating.” 
“Mississippi, though commencing late, is progressing steadily and efficiently in 
the establishment of a system of free schools, notwithstanding the great and bit- 
ter opposition, appointed county superintendents, collecting the school tax, and 
building schoolhouses.” 
“The school code of Louisiana, containing some features well adapted to effi- 
ciency and administered with great energy, has encountered an opposition so per- 
sistent and fierce that its success outside the city of New Orleans has been most 
unsatisfactory to its friends.” 
“Georgia has just passed a school code and appointed a State Commissioner, 
but must wait a year for funds with which to put the system into full operation.” 
“In Texas, no school legislation has, so far, succeeded, and no public officers 
are at work for the organization of schools, her entire people being left to grow 
up in ignorance, save here and there a private enterprise throws a ray of light 
upon the general darkness.” 
Into this dreary picture comes the life of George Peabody, with his 
gift of $2,000,000, saying as he put the endowment into the hands of 
a board of trustees: “This I give to the suffering South for the good 
of the whole country; use it for the promotion of intellectual, moral, 
and industrial education.” 
It is well to keep in mind the fact that this gift, made in 1867 and 
supplemented in 1869, came at the very time of the attempted organ- 
ization of the state public-school systems of the South. Texas organ- 
ized in 1866; Arkansas and Florida, in 1868; Mississippi, Virginia, 
and Georgia, in 1870. Tennessee organized in 1835 and reorganized 
in 1873; North Carolina organized in 1858 and reorganized after the 
war ; and so on through the entire list. 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  152 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
From 1869 to 1879 money from the Peabody Fund was given to all 
the Southern states. That allotted to Texas, for instance, was ap- 
portioned to a number of schools in an endeavor to establish strong 
schools at strategic points. The first of these allotments was $1,000 
to San Antonio in 1869. No other payments were made till the school 
year of 1873-1874, when various sums were allotted to schools at 
Fredericksburg, Lancaster, Gainesville, and Marshall. In 1879 the 
Legislature of Texas, influenced by an offer from the Peabody Board, 
established the Sam Houston Normal Institute, at Huntsville, to which 
institution donations varying in amounts from $7,500 to $2,500 were 
made from time to time. Considerable aid was given summer nor- 
mals and teachers’ institutes, and a lecturer furnished whose business 
it was to arouse interest in education throughout the state. 
In Florida from 1871 to 1878 twelve or fifteen common schools 
were aided in amounts varying from $200 to $1,400 to each school, 
the total sum thus donated being $33,750. From 1895 to 1902 dona- 
tions were made to training schools for teachers, the amount varying 
from $1,000 to $1,500, the total amount contributed for teacher 
training being $9,500. In 1879, $300 was donated to each of two 
negro schools, one at Tallahassee and the other at Gainesville. Dur- 
ing the same year $400 was given the state superintendent for con- 
tingent and traveling expenses for his office. The total amount of 
money given by the Peabody Board to the State of Florida, exclu- 
sive of what was paid to scholarship students, was $44,250. On April 
29, 1897, Dr. J. L. M. Curry, general agent of the Peabody Fund, 
addressed the Florida legislature in behalf of an appropriation for 
summer normals, and succeeded in getting for that purpose an annual 
allowance of $3,000. Though Dr. Curry passed into the great beyond 
a short time afterwards, his voice through the years has increased in 
power in the legislative halls of Florida, for now this appropriation 
has grown from $3,000 to $20,000 annually. 
With an intensive effort of this kind being carried on simultaneously 
in every Southern state, the effect was powerful and far-reaching. 
Good schools, though at first few and far apart, served as an inspira- 
tion to other communities. All these units were organized in the 
various states, and the foundation for our splendid state system of 
public schools in the South had been laid. 
One state superintendent, in his annual report in those early days, 
has this to say in reference to help given by the Peabody Board: 
“The aid thus kindly rendered, besides affording free-school facilities to thou- 
sands of children, accomplished for the cause of popular education a far grander
-P-A-G-E-163
  
Third Day,—Bond 153 
result in illustrating what may be achieved through a well-ordered and model 
system of public schools when properly organized and liberally supported.” 
The first point I wish to make, therefore, is that the officials of the 
Peabody Board, aided by Peabody College, assisted very largely, ma- 
terially and otherwise, in the founding of the state systems of public 
schools of the South. This fact should be taught in our public schools 
and colleges, so that our people may ever be grateful for this help so 
kindly given in the day of our greatest need. 
From 1879 to 1904 approximately $600,000 was paid out in schol- 
arships to nearly 2,000 men and women. A scholarship consisted of 
return railroad fare from home to Peabody College and $12.50 a month 
during the college session, and was good for two years. To me it was 
a great pleasure once a month while a student here to go to the busi- 
ness office and receive a ten-dollar bill, a two-dollar bill, and a fifty-cent 
piece. As few of us carried purses, most of the men would take some 
of the money in each hand, thrust it into their trousers, and, with both 
pockets bulging, come smiling down the walk toward old Lindsley Hall. 
No money has ever been given for the cause of education that did 
more good and was more appreciated than was this money for schol- 
arships. Money put into great buildings and equipment can never 
reach many for whom it was intended. 
These two thousand well-trained, patriotic, determined young 
teachers went literally into every nook and corner of the South, aflame 
with a desire for better schools. Interest in longer terms, better- 
trained teachers, better schoolhouses, and, best of all, in children, was 
kindled in thousands of places in city, town, and country. These 
young teachers carried with them also the spirit of old Peabody, 
which has never been surpassed and never can be, for it was almost 
ideal. That spirit was opposed to hazing, insubordination, snobbish- 
ness, sham, and other evils prevalent in so many of our colleges and 
universities to-day. 
What was this spirit? In college it made you love your fellow stu- 
dent and respect and admire your instructor. As a teacher, it made 
you love your pupils and do your best to teach them, not only the les- 
sons in the books, but the greater lessons of honesty, industry, health, 
patriotism, love of home, and faith in God. 
These scholarship students were the real beginning of our present- 
day educational progress in the South. They were pioneers in or- 
ganizing county and state teachers’ associations, dividing the work of 
the school into grades, bringing about uniformity in county and state 
courses of study, starting the consolidation of rural schools, etc. 
These thousands of active workers and real teachers were an influ-  
-P-A-G-E-164
  154 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
ence of tremendous power in the building and organizing of state 
public-school systems, and Peabody College can point to no greater 
constructive work than the training and inspiring of these young men 
and women of the South. 
After leaving Peabody in 1902, I went back to Mississippi, my na- 
tive state. For ten years I was principal of a high school, for four 
years taught history and Latin in our State Normal School, and for 
the last nine years have held the office of state superintendent of 
education. A few years ago we employed as our high-school super- 
visor a Mississippi teacher who was just finishing his Ph.D. degree 
here at George Peabody College. He brought with him into his work 
the latest ideas in reference to the grading, classification, accrediting 
of schools, teacher training, tests and measurements, etc. His efforts 
had a most telling effect on all kinds and classes of schools and col- 
leges in reference to standardization. Teachers were added in hun- 
dreds of schools, untrained and uneducated teachers dismissed and 
their places filled by those who met the requirements, equipment 
bought, schoolhouses built, rooms added, and so on. As a result, all 
our schools had a rebirth, as it were, and we are now going forward, 
happy over the outcome. Our supervisor of home economics work in 
Smith-Hughes schools has reached, with federal and state aid, not 
only the town, city, and agricultural high schools, but also consolidated 
schools in remote rural districts. She is an M.A. from George Pea- 
body College. Not long since our supervisor of white rural schools, 
under the direction of Peabody College, worked out a series of plans, 
specifications, and blueprints for rural schoolhouses. The fact that 
1,212 of these plans have been used within the last few years shows 
that in our rural school districts beautiful, well-planned houses, lo- 
cated on several acres of land, are taking the place of the old-time, 
inconvenient, unpainted house. 
What George Peabody College has done for the public-school system 
of Mississippi through our state department of education is true 
with reference to every other Southern state; for in the state depart- 
ment of Georgia there are now five Peabody people; in Virginia, one; 
in Florida, one (the state superintendent); in Arkansas, five; in 
Texas, five; in Tennessee, four; in Louisiana, three; in North Caro- 
lina, four; in Kentucky, three; and in West Virginia, one—a total of 
thirty-four in the eleven Southern states of which I have definite in- 
formation. It is safe to say that during the last fifteen years there 
have been twice that number of Peabody men and women connected in 
an official way with the various state departments of education in 
this section of the country.

Up to the present time four graduates of Peabody College have be- 
come State Superintendents of Education in the South. They are as 
follows: J. W. Brister, Tennessee; W. S. Cawthon, Florida; J. B. As- 
well, Louisiana; and W. F. Bond, Mississippi. Two of these are at 
present in this office—Mr. Cawthon, of Florida, and the writer of this 
paper. The influence of these people has been most far-reaching and 
fruitful; and when taken in connection with the splendid work of the 
thousands of teachers who have been here for training, especially since 
the organization of the Greater Peabody College, we can see that much 
good has been done. 
George Peabody College has, without question, influenced in a very 
large way state public-school systems in the matter of standards for 
schools and teachers, plans for schoolhouses and grounds, and the re- 
directing of home economics work in rural and high schools. 
If the United States Commissioner of Education of fifty years ago 
were here to report on our educational status to-day, how different his 
statement would be from that part of the report called to your atten- 
tion a few minutes ago! He would write it down that Mississippi has 
43 all-Southern high schools, 249 accredited four-year high schools, 
more than 1,000 consolidated schools with transportation, 49 agri- 
cultural high schools, 300 teachers’ homes, and an equalizing school 
fund annually of more than $1,000,000, in addition to the regular 
state fund of more than $2,000,000. South Carolina would show 34 
all-Southern high schools, 140 four-year high schools, 340 consolidated 
schools. So on through the list of states. Fourteen states reporting 
show a total of 6,123 consolidated schools and 4,927 four-year high 
schools, of which 894 are on the all-Southern list. 
The dream of George Peabody, the founder of this college, with ref- 
erence to the South, has more than come true. His wishes have been 
realized. The South has been redeemed. 
Old Peabody, in accordance with the wishes of its founder, opened 
its doors toward the South in the days of the South’s direst extremity 
and greatest need. New Peabody, the South having been redeemed 
educationally, looks also to the East, the North, and the West. Al- 
ready a new day is dawning which, when it shall have reached its full 
splendor, will see this institution serving in the largest possible way 
the entire nation.

THE INFLUENCE OF GEORGE PEABODY COLLEGE 
FOR TEACHERS ON TEACHER TRAINING 
  
JOSEPH ROEMER 
Professor of Secondary Education and High-School Visitor, University of Florida 
  
If time permitted the cataloguing of the detailed facts in the story 
of Peabody’s development, it could be shown that she has passed 
through three great epochs in her influence upon teacher training in 
the South. 
Back in the gloomy days of reconstruction the trustees of the Pea- 
body Education Fund saw that the only real solution of our national 
ills was education. They saw, too, that this must be public educa- 
tion, undertaken and operated by the states. The preceding addresses 
have pointed out clearly how every energy was exerted to build up 
state departments and call into being state systems of common schools. 
But throughout all this great undertaking it was fully recognized that 
a great public-school system in the final analysis rested upon trained 
teachers. Trained administrators, trained supervisors, and trained 
teachers, this board recognized, must be had before state school sys- 
tems could be created and operated. 
So the great idea of teacher training became one of the few con- 
trolling purposes of this board. It was deemed necessary to open a 
model normal school for the training of teachers, for the purpose of 
leading the way in this new field of educational endeavor in the South. 
So Peabody Normal College, at Nashville, opened its doors for the 
first time in 1875, thus proclaiming to the South that implicit faith 
in the professional training of teachers which has ever since been the 
cardinal doctrine of the Peabody creed. Through all the phases of 
her career Peabody has for these fifty years kept true to her mission. 
She has fought the good fight; she has kept the faith. The early 
period witnessed an almost desperate struggle against poverty and 
ignorance; but through adversity and prosperity, through misunder- 
standing of the public and even her friends, against the sneers of ene- 
mies and often the bungling efforts of would-be helpers, Peabody stood 
unflinchingly to the task of the training of teachers. And finally a 
great triumph was achieved. By 1887 Peabody had won to her stand- 
ard a great group of trained schoolmen and had firmly established in 
the minds of the people in state after state the idea of teacher train- 
ing and the duty of the states to support normal schools. 
During this first epoch of twelve or fifteen years Peabody Normal
-P-A-G-E-167
Third Day,—Roemer 157 
College served as a type of institution to be multiplied throughout the 
Southern states, and at the same time was the recognized central 
agency for promoting the training of teachers in this area. At this 
initial stage the institution was modeled after the prevailing normal 
school of that period, with a two-years’ course of professional study, 
at the end of which a diploma was given granting the title “Licentiate 
of Instruction.” So far as this course of study went, it was solid in 
scholarship and inculcated an earnest professional purpose by courses 
in psychology and in the history and principles of education. 
Those holding this L.I. diploma went out and became the leaders 
and inspirers of education in every Southern state. Most of them had 
come from the states to which they returned, by the selective process 
of competitive examinations for Peabody scholarships. They went 
back to their states into the most important positions as teachers in 
the public schools, as principals and superintendents, as leaders in 
creating a sentiment for better schools and for trained teachers. As 
the states began to establish normal schools, many of these same per- 
sons became members of the normal-school faculties and heads of the 
normal schools. 
Thus the first phase of Peabody’s great mission had been achieved— 
that of demonstrating to the South that the trained teacher is the basic 
element in the development of a system of public education. 
In the next epoch, keeping pace with the advance in education and 
stimulating to further advance, Peabody gradually increased entrance 
requirements and expanded the course of study into a four-year cur- 
riculum, leading to a standard bachelor’s degree. The policy of the 
institution was to develop, according to the best collegiate standards, 
a course of study based upon liberal scholarship and permeated with 
the best principles and practices of teaching. The standards main- 
tained during this period were those of the best institutions in the 
Southern states. At the same time there was not left out of sight the 
fundamental aim of creating a teachers college in order to stimulate 
state normal schools into the best policies and to continue to serve as 
the central institution for the higher training of graduates from the 
state normal schools. 
No sooner had the idea of teacher training been firmly implanted 
and generally accepted as a part of our educational economy than 
Peabody launched upon her second great objective—that of dignifying 
teaching by placing it on a par with all the other so-called learned 
professions. As a result, the old L.I. course of two years was more 
and more adapted to professional work leading to the diploma for 
elementary teachers, and there was added the standard bachelor’s
-P-A-G-E-168
158 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
course of four years of college work on top of a high-school education, 
designed for the advanced students and the prospective leaders. Here 
again Peabody’s mission was that of a pioneer ; but, as in the previous 
period, she fought valiantly for the cause she knew to be right. 
From an enrollment of thirteen on that first discouraging December 
morning in 1875 the student body by 1890 rose to 200, and by 1900 
had risen to 600, proving that a great clientele had been built up for 
the institution and the idea it championed. 
This second period, from about 1890 to 1911, marks the great era 
of normal-school building in the South. During all these years Pea- 
body made it her mission to foster and encourage this wonderful 
growth, the foundations of which she had seen laid and whose devel- 
opment she zealously fostered. It has been her privilege to see this 
idea of teacher training grow in the South from her own organiza- 
tion, with a faculty of three and a student body of thirteen, into a 
great network of forty normal schools, twenty-five of which are teach- 
ers colleges, offering four full years of college work and granting 
standard bachelor’s degrees. Her original faculty of three has grown 
now to 150 annually, and the student body of thirteen has swollen into 
a host of some 3,000 students every calendar year. The few thousand 
dollars invested in the original buildings and the small annual income 
have grown until now there are upward of $5,600,000 invested in 
school properties and endowment dedicated to teacher training, and 
the few dollars required to finance that first faculty of three has grown 
to a great maintenance budget of nearly half a million dollars annu- 
ally. 
But with the teacher-training idea firmly implanted in the South 
and with all the states having normal schools well established for the 
training of their quota of teachers, there was no longer any excuse 
for Peabody’s existence, functioning merely as a normal school and a 
teachers college devoted entirely to undergraduate work. Conse- 
quently in 1911 a new campus was acquired and teaching discontin- 
ued temporarily for the purpose of building a new plant and organ- 
izing anew program. Teaching was resumed in 1914, directed to the 
third great objective—that of training educational leaders and direc- 
tors. True to the prophecy of old, Peabody has never perished, be- 
cause she has always been ready with a wider vision as fast as ideals 
are realized. From the Peabody trying with slender resources to es- 
tablish the idea of teacher training she moved on next into the field 
of the teachers college, endeavoring there to dignify and profession- 
alize the great work of the teacher and put it on a par with the other 
learned professions, only to change finally into what is now mainly a

senior college and graduate school for the specific purpose of training 
educational leaders and directors. This means the training of presi- 
dents, deans, and faculty members of teacher-training institutions, 
superintendents of city schools, state superintendents of public in- 
struction, etc. 
This need of a graduate school for the training of educational lead- 
ers and directors was well expressed by Dr. C. A. McMurry when he 
said: 
“In all the higher places in education we are in constant danger of an over- 
supply of incompetent leaders, who may properly be called ‘blind leaders of the 
blind.’ Let this be said with all charity, but with firmness. 
“The chief reason why we have tens of thousands of unqualified teachers on the 
great plane of common-school education is that we are short on superior leaders 
on the upper levels of education. 
“Our education is powerfully weak at the top—just where the greatest strength 
ought to be. 
“Superior leadership in education demands now a higher form of teacher 
training which is new to the world. We must find a third very superior group 
of educators, who are teachers of the teachers of teachers. 
“There should, then, be three classes of expert teachers: 
“1, The regular teachers in the schools. 
“2. The normal-school faculties and other supervisors of teachers. All these 
are engaged in training inexperienced teachers. 
“3. The superior body of teachers who are training and equipping normal- 
school faculties and other supervisors. They have the high responsibility of be- 
ing teachers of the teachers of teachers. 
“The demand for this third class of superior teachers sets up a new problem 
in education which many intelligent people have never thought of.” 
It is to the training of this special type of leadership that Peabody 
is dedicated. 
Most gratifying is it to see what rapid strides Peabody has made 
in this endeavor since 1914. Well does the speaker remember when 
the first graduate club, consisting of eighteen members, met and or- 
ganized for work in the early fall of 1914. Now the records show 
that there are in residence over 300 graduate students; that last year 
there were graduated over 100 candidates for the master’s degree 
and five candidates for the degree of doctor of philosophy. This 
means that Peabody is the outstanding graduate school of the South; 
in fact, there are more graduate students in residence now than there 
are in all the other institutions of the South combined. The extent 
to which Peabody has developed as a graduate school may be seen 
from a recent statement issued by the College:
-P-A-G-E-170
  160 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
“Examination of the positions filled by those who have graduated from George 
Peabody College for Teachers in recent years shows that— 
“1 out of every 4 is teaching in a normal school; 
“1 out of every 10 is a member of a college or university faculty; 
“1 out of every 15 is a city or county superintendent; 
“1 out of every 10 is a supervisor of a city, county, or state system; 
“1 out of every 9 is a principal of a high school or grammar school; 
“1 out of every 49 is a missionary in foreign lands.” 
If you will pardon a personal reference, in my own state of Florida 
three of the four superintendents of the largest city schools are Pea- 
body men; five of the eight superintendents of the next largest cities 
are Peabody men; three of the outstanding county superintendents 
are Peabody men; our state superintendent, our state high-school in- 
spector, one of our two state rural-school inspectors, and the president 
of our state university, as well as two members of that faculty, are all 
Peabody men. It is leadership of this type that the South needs and 
that Peabody is endeavoring to train. 
Another factor in building a graduate school is facilities with which 
to work. These may be placed under two headings—faculty and 
library accommodations. Here again Peabody is equal to the best 
in the whole South. With her highly trained faculty and her splen- 
didly equipped new library building, she is fast becoming eminently 
qualified to do graduate work. 
People are prone to judge a school by the large number of students 
enrolled. This has never been the aim of Peabody College. She has 
ever stressed quality rather than quantity. In my humble opinion, I 
believe this institution should never get too large to lose the fine per- 
sonal touch existing between faculty and students. It is this sort of 
thing that goes for the making of that splendid type of leadership 
mentioned above. Leadership is not trained en masse. 
Since 1914, Peabody, functioning primarily as a graduate school, 
has ever been the great Southern exponent of all that is sound and 
progressive in the professional training of teachers. Believing as 
she has from her very inception that the most precious things in all 
the world are our children and knowing so well the tremendous re- 
sponsibilities placed upon teachers in molding and shaping these 
young lives into desirable men and women, Peabody has ever stood 
and still stands for the idea that the finest talent and the most expert 
training in our civilization should be dedicated to teaching. And in 
the strength of this conviction she has fought the first half century of 
her existence. Through her alumni, scattered throughout the length 
and breadth of the South, working in all kinds and types of teacher-

training institutions, Peabody is beginning her second fifty years of 
service with renewed strength and clearer vision. Rejoicing in tri- 
umphs, profiting by experiences, ever eager to learn, radiant with a 
new hope born of success, and filled with the vigor of youth, she reso- 
lutely goes on her high mission of dignifying and ennobling the great 
cause of teaching. Let her alumna, S. Elizabeth Davis, voice our 
faith:

GREETING 
  
MISS JULIA A. SEARS 
Professor of Mathematics, 1875-1907 
Fairhaven, Mass. 
  
From George Peabody College for Teachers of 1875 to the same 
institution of 1925. 
From the faculty of three members and a student body of thirteen 
in 1875 to a faculty of 150 and a student body of 3,000 in 1925. 
From the faithful men and women who from time to time have 
been added to the faculty, to whom the College owes a debt of grati- 
tude for their faithful, loyal service. 
Every class leaving the College with its diploma is a greeting to 
those that follow. Every individual of that class, whether a profes- 
sional or business man or woman, if fighting the battles of life bravely 
and working for the good of mankind, is himself a greeting to the 
College of to-day. 
“Without a vision, the people perish,” is as true to-day as when it 
was written centuries ago—true of any enterprise worth enduring. 
The early settlers of this country saw the vision of a great republic. 
With this vision constantly before them and faith in God to bring it 
to pass through their own efforts and sacrifices, they saw the vision 
constantly being fulfilled. It was religion and education that stood 
foremost in the minds of these early settlers. To these two great 
   
-P-A-G-E-174
  162 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
forces they bent their untiring efforts. Slowly, but surely, the vision 
was unfolding, for churches, colleges, and public schools followed in 
the march of civilization. 
Without any hesitation as to the call that would be made upon their 
own: resources, the leaders of education in the southern part of our 
republic accepted thankfully the gift of the great American philan- 
thropist whose name the College bears, for by it they saw the more 
rapid development of their vision. 
Let me call to your minds for a moment the opening exercises of 
George Peabody College for Teachers. It was an opening befitting 
the vision of a great university. At the invitation of Governor Por- 
ter, whose heart was in the work and whose last days were spent as 
the head of the College he:loved, the exercises were held in the Hall of 
Representatives in the Capitol, the Governor presiding and the little 
band of pioneers occupying a prominent place. With music and 
speakers depicting the College to be, the formal opening of George 
Peabody College for Teachers was held on December 1, 1875. Asa 
member of the faculty, may I claim the privilege of doing what I 
know would be the wish of that meeting—of extending their greeting 
to the College of 1925. 
In this College I spent thirty-two years as a teacher—the best and 
happiest years of my life, made so by the courtesy, the enthusiasm, 
the appreciation of the students, and the cordial reception of the citi- 
zens of Nashville. It was an ideal teacher’s life. 
With thankfulness for having had the privilege of helping fulfill the 
vision of 1875, I extend my personal, heartfelt greetings to the College 
of 1925. 
Let us not forget, but with gratitude remember, the former presi- 
dents of the College. 
Dr. Eben S. Stearns, a graduate and for many years a trustee of 
Harvard University, the first president, saw a wide field before him— 
a field awaiting cultivation—and with the opportunity arose the vision 
of a coming university. Wisely and well he laid the foundation of his 
vision, and wisely he built thereon. His work is his greeting. 
Dr. William H. Payne, a graduate of the University of Michigan and 
for many years a member of the faculty, a man well known for his 
writings on education, carried on the work with marked ability. His 
own work, too, is his greeting. 
Governor James D. Porter, a graduate of the University of Nash- 
ville, of which he always spoke with pride, a man who filled many 
honorable positions in the state and nation, spent the last few years 
of his life as president of the College. As a member of the Peabody
-P-A-G-E-175

Board from the early days of its organization, he kept ever before 
that body the great opportunity of advancing the cause of education 
in a large section of our own country, thereby gaining their confidence 
and willingness to aid in its financial support. His very presence in 
the College was his constant greeting. 
May God’s blessings ever rest upon George Peabody College for 
Teachers. 
“THE ORIGINAL THIRTEEN” 
  
MISS LIZZIE L. BLOOMSTEIN 
Librarian Emerita of Peabody College 
  
On an important occasion in Paris an orator was called to the ros- 
trum after Victor Hugo had spoken. Immediately his audience began 
to hiss, and upon his surprised inquiry of the cause of such conduct, 
the answer came: “No one dares speak here after Victor Hugo.” I 
feel myself in the same position after the eloquent addresses of so 
many renowned gentlemen, and yet I dare rise, because I am one of 
“the original thirteen” of the first class of Peabody fifty years ago. 
No. 13 is a number of ill omen, and yet nothing but superstition 
and folklore give credence to the almost universal belief. When we 
recall the fact that thirteen colonies developed into the thirteen states 
and that our thirteen has increased into this great institution, how can 
we any longer have faith in the ill omen of the number? 
As when the heavens rolled away and St. John saw a vision of the 
city beautiful, so in the great soul of George Peabody was born a 
vision of his great benefaction. So a vision of a new education broke 
with the morning sunshine upon the degradation and discomfort of 
the South. There was born a new dream and a new hope. Within 
these was the impulse of educational training. Soon the plans of the 
great educational triumvirate—George Peabody, Robert C. Winthrop, 
and Barnas Sears—were consummated; and the next step was made 
in the constructive work of executing them, when the man who was 
to be the president of the new College came into our midst. He, too, 
had a vision, as well as George Peabody, and answered to a call as 
truly as did Isaiah when he replied, “Send me; I will go,” in answer 
to God’s call, “Whom shall I send?” 
The stage of devastation, of blight and destruction of our fair land, 
has already been set, and the picture is fresh in our minds; yet I can-
-P-A-G-E-176
164 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
not refrain from drawing the curtain aside for one moment and per- 
mitting you to glimpse it again. In 1875, just ten years after the 
close of the terrible war that for years had devastated our fair land, 
the wounds of the South had not yet been healed. Prejudice, suspi- 
cion, and distrust prevailed against any undertaking fostered by a 
man from north of Mason and Dixon’s line. “Damn Yankee” was 
one word in those days. The work of the president was truly a work 
of creation. He had to secure a clientele as well as build up the Col- 
lege. The material conditions of the school had to be created, and 
these also without money or credit. Everything that goes to make a 
school home was lacking—comfortable rooms, desks, recitation seats, 
books, maps, globes, warmth, light, office facilities; but all must, in 
some sort, be supplied before the new school could havea home. Dur- 
ing the war the campus had been occupied by regiments of soldiers. 
Nearly every tree and shrub had been destroyed; the buildings had 
been used for hospital purposes, the gray on one side of the entrance 
hall and the blue on the other. The rude and unsparing hand of war 
had left its blight upon everything that could tempt a soldier’s cupid- 
ity or lawlessness. I remember well in one room old, torn books, 
soldier trappings, the remains of an aviary, and a large planetarium 
were thrown together helter-skelter. 
When the trustees had cast about for a location for George Pea- 
body’s benefaction for a training school for the Southland, Nashville 
was selected—not because of the zeal of the people to have it, but be- 
cause of its central location as a gateway for the Southern country. 
Then, too, the liberal offer of the trustees of the University of Nash- 
ville in their buildings and a small annuity had not been duplicated 
by any other city or state. 
In a historical sketch delivered by Dr. Stearns at the ninth anni- 
versary of the opening of the College he speaks of its small beginnings 
thus: “The evening previous to the opening, in talking to several gen- 
tlemen on the subject, one of them said: ‘I have made a careful canvass, 
and I think possibly there may be eight young ladies to meet you 
to-morrow. Will you attempt to organize with so small a number” 
‘Yes,’ I replied. ‘But,’ said another, laughingly, ‘suppose you find 
only half that number, will you commence?’ ‘Yes,’ I replied, ‘I will.’ 
‘But,’ said another still, laughing, ‘if none present themselves, what 
will you do? ‘Then,’ said I, ‘I will organize myself into a normal 
school. We begin to-morrow.’ And on to-morrow commence we did 
with thirteen young ladies.” 
And the first steps of organization were taken. He must have 
remembered that the first normal school established in this coun- 
try—the one at Lexington, Mass., in 18839—began with only four.
-P-A-G-E-177

Third Day,—Bloomstein 165 
How mighty has the host grown from that forlorn hope! In 
the evening of that memorable day—December 1, 1875—the school 
was formally inaugurated by appropriate exercises in the Hall of 
Representatives at the Capitol, His Excellency Governor Porter, 
presiding. Addresses were made by Judge Watson, representing 
the Peabody Board; Mr. Ewing, representing the University Board; 
and Colonel Trousdale, Superintendent of Public Instruction, repre- 
senting the State Board of Education. Music by the United States 
Band, which was stationed here, enlivened the occasion. What more 
imposing inauguration could there have been if the College had opened 
with thirteen hundred students instead of thirteen? 
What do you suppose was found in the building to aid in the work? 
One book only—a well-worn Bible. With that good book as our corner 
stone, we struck out boldly. I remember well the chapter read from 
the good book for the morning lesson—the first chapter of Genesis, ‘In 
the beginning God.” What more appropriate lesson could have been 
selected? The faculty had but three members—the president, Miss 
Julia A. Sears, beloved by the whole Southland, and Miss Emma M. 
Cutter—and two classrooms and one office. In a tribute to Dr. Stearns 
by Miss Sears, she speaks of the opening thus: “Nothing daunted by 
the smallness of our numbers, we commenced our work with brave 
and courageous hearts; and I doubt if teachers ever had more ear- 
nest and honest pupils or pupils who had more faith and confidence 
in their teachers than these thirteen pupils had in us.” Although our 
school has grown so large, I have tender, pleasant memories of those 
early days. Those thirteen young ladies were eager, alert, and enthu- 
siastic. They were fired by lofty ideals and worthy ambitions. The 
“pioneers,” as Dr. Stearns designated them, were as follows: 
Lizzie Lee Bloomstein. Josephine Roesfeld. 
Mattie Capps. Callie Sneed. 
Augusta Gattinger. *Mary A. F. Stearns. 
*Alida B. Harrison. Fannie Whitworth. 
Lizzie Keel. *Virginia Zollicoffer Wilson. 
*Alice R. Phillips. *Eliza Woodfin. 
Agnes Waldine Putnam. 
In order to increase the number, Dr. Lindsley, secretary of the 
State Board of Education, enrolled his daughter, who did not be- 
come a regular student until later, and President Stearns like- 
wise enrolled his. Despite the prejudice that existed, Dr. Stearns 
and his two teachers were cordially received into the home of 
  
‘Deceased. (Five alive, three unknown.)   
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  166 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
one of our most distinguished families—that of Dr. John Berrien 
Lindsley, formerly chancellor of the University of Nashville and son 
of Dr. Philip Lindsley, founder of the university. Dr. Stearns and his 
teachers immediately won our confidence and devotion, and our rela- 
tions were more like that of an affectionate family than anything 
else—a family of devoted children, animated by filial affection. 
At the opening of the College there were no historical associa- 
tions or college traditions, no local color, no background, no societies, 
no fraternities, no sororities. Dr. Stearns knew the students and 
always had time to greet and say an encouraging word on the campus; 
and I can recall him speaking to us with hat in hand, standing like a 
gallant cavalier, for he was a gentleman of the old school. It would 
be very pleasant indeed to tell of the incidents and work of those early 
days, but there was very little of historical interest beyond the regular 
duties of student work. It has been said: “Happy is the land that 
has no history.” Ours was certainly one of quiet, peaceful, and hope- 
ful growth. 
Dr. Stearns was constantly looking out for means of securing the 
support of the state. He often took us to the Capitol to meet officials 
or to near-by cities, where we gave exhibitions in practical pedagogy. 
He never lost sight of the fact that the College was a training school, 
and everything was taught from a pedagogical standpoint. As we 
had no demonstration school, our classes were converted into demon- 
stration classes, and teaching exercises were constantly given and cor- 
rected and criticized. Call this kind of work an “apprenticeship” if 
you will, but it was probably the best of its kind that was known at 
the time. We made much of the apparatus used, and the ingenuity 
of Miss Sears in creating it was wonderful. It can truly be said of 
her that she was a Mark Hopkins at one end of the log, with a boy at 
the other, constituting a university. We must remember that in those 
days books on the science and art of pedagogy were scarcely available 
anywhere in this country, for the work of such teachers as Froebel, 
Pestalozzi, and Comenius was hardly understood in this country be- 
fore 1855. Through Dr. Barnard’s educational work the first chair of 
pedagogy was not founded until 1879. This was established at the 
University of Michigan and filled by the late William Harold Payne, 
the much-beloved former president of Peabody College and chancellor 
of the University of Nashville from 1887 to 1901. When Dr. Stearns 
died, Dr. J. L. M. Curry, the disbursing agent of the Peabody Fund, 
was minister to Spain under the administration of Cleveland. He 
crossed the Atlantic in order to appoint Dr. Stearns’ successor. He 
could have put his fingers on any educator in the United States for the
-P-A-G-E-179
Third Day,—Bloomstein . 167 
position, but he selected Dr. William Harold Payne, whose presidency 
brought an enrichment to the College that can never be overestimated. 
In spite of the prejudice, most of the members of the pioner class 
belonged to our best families. Miss Augusta Gattinger is the daugh- 
ter of the late August Gattinger, a renowned scholar and scientist, the 
man who made the first classification of the flora of Tennessee, as well 
as a writer of many books. Another daughter of this distinguished 
scientist, Miss Minnie Gattinger, was instructor in art at Peabody 
College for fourteen wears, and is noted for having exhibited at the 
Champs Elysees Salon, at Paris. Miss Agnes Waldine Putnam was a 
descendant at one and the same time of Israel Putnam and John Se- 
vier, of Tennessee. Mrs. Wilson was the daughter of the famous 
soldier, General Zollicoffer, and mother of our worthy ex-mayor, 
Felix Zollicoffer Wilson. Miss Phillips, the most brilliant gir] 
in the class, was the daughter of Dr. D. W. Phillips, president of 
Roger Williams College, and became the wife of the late Ebenezer 
Calvert, artist, who died only last year, and whose sister was the wife 
of the great astronomer, Dr. Barnard. Miss Whitworth married Mr. 
Frazier, and is the mother of Mr. Neal Frazier, professor of English 
at the State Normal School, in Murfreesboro. And the last, but not 
least, Miss Louise Lindsley, who was nominally one of the thirteen, 
is the daughter of the late Dr. J. Berrien Lindsley, former chancellor 
of the University of Nashville, and granddaughter of Dr. Philip Linds- 
ley, the first chancellor of that university, who declined the presidency 
of seven different colleges and left Princeton University as vice Presi- 
dent to come to Nashville, as an educational missionary field, to be- 
come the first chancellor of the University of Nashville in 1826. 
The first commencement was held in May, 1877, at the Masonic 
Theater, and the first essay read on that occasion was upon the very 
significant subject: “A Good Cause Makes a Stout Heart.” In look- 
ing over that essay we can readily see that Peabody began her work 
with high ideals, which represented and inspired the highest and best 
in education. Her ideals and policies in all the years of her growth 
were none other than those she had in the past. Dr. Stearns always 
referred to the institution as a “beacon light,” “a city set upon a hill;” 
and the venerable president of the board, Hon. R. C. Winthrop, always 
called it “our great Normal College at Nashville.” I quote from that 
essay: “Ever onward rolls the tide of time, and like a waif on its bil- 
lows has it carried with it two years since the members of this institu- 
tion were organized into a little band that they might the better pre- 
pare themselves for the teachers’ noble work, and to them was given
-P-A-G-E-180
  168 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
the watchword of God to Israel’s leader in the wilderness, ‘Go for- 
ward.’” 
Dr. Francis Peabody, in one of his inspiring talks to Harvard stu- 
dents, draws a picture of a becalmed vessel on a glassy sea. There 
is not a breath of air to fill a sail, while the men wait and watch. 
However, they notice that all at once the little pennant upon the mast- 
head begins to stir and move. There is not a ripple on the water nor 
the faintest moving of air on deck; but when they see the pennant 
stirring, they know that there is a wind rising in the higher air, and 
they quickly set their upper sails. Instantly the vessel begins to move 
under the higher currents, while on the surface of the water there is 
only a dead calm. 
In life there are higher and lower currents. There are winds that 
come down from the mountains of God. From the very beginning 
Peabody set her sails to the higher currents, and our benefaction was 
accepted on the high plane of our benefactor’s motto: “Education, 
a debt due from present to future generations.” Thus Peabody 
based her work on the high ethical principles of the beauty of service, 
and was from the very beginning altruistic. Thus Peabody ideals 
have crystallized into the splendid activities of Peabody men and 
women, and has given them the magnificent power, position, and in- 
fluence they possess in every walk of life. Our period of organization 
has long passed. We have entered into the period of magnificent ex- 
pansion and growth. Should we not be inspired to nobler efforts, 
since we are recognized and can work and build with public opinion in 
our favor? What a goodly heritage is ours! This College lives in 
the affections of its students, and is thus destined to a happy immor- 
tality. No school ever held a more secure place in the hearts of her 
children than Peabody College. : 
This is our fiftieth anniversary, our Golden Jubilee. It is time to 
blow the trumpets of announcement. It is time to send this knowl- 
edge over the world. Our achievements are white with May, and we 
can say with Tennyson: 
Blow trumpet, for the world is white with May; 
Blow trumpet, the long night hath roll’d away! 
Blow thro’ the living world—“Let the King reign.” 
Shall Rome or Heathen rule in Arthur’s realm? 
Flash brand and lance, fall battleaxe upon helm, 
Fall battleaxe, and flash brand! Let the King reign. 
Blow trumpet! he will lift us from the dust. 
Blow trumpet! live the strength and die the lust! 
Clang battleaxe, and clash brand! Let the King reign.

Let our King of light and joy and peace rule the world. 
At the celebration of the jubilee year among the Israelites of old, 
each man came into his possessions. All prisoners were released, all 
debts canceled by law, and every one restored to his patrimony. That 
was one of the great feasts of the trumpets. They were blown on the 
first and tenth days of the seventh month of the year. It was a 
clarion call to liberty, and I beg of all of our Peabody alumni to par- 
ticipate in this feast of the trumpets. Let us come into our patrimony 
of progress, development, and advancement of light and culture. 
That is the patrimony of a Peabody student to-day. It is our duty to 
so foster this patrimony as to make it a hundredfold more valuable. 
Let us blow the trumpets and call the faithful together. Let us make 
this feast of the trumpets a holy convocation and consecrate ourselves 
anew to the noble ambitions and spiritual purposes of our Alma Mater 
for the “glory of God and the service of man.” Let us carry this gos- 
pel of education all over the land, so that we may establish peace in 
the world, so that we may then realize the words of the prophet Isaiah: 
“They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into 
pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither 
shall they learn war any more.” “The wolf shall also dwell with the 
lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the 
young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.” 
THE BUSINESS WORLD AS RELATED TO THE 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS AND THE 
TEACHING PROFESSION 
  
Cc. J. MAXWELL 
  
The greatest question before the American people to-day is the ade- 
quate and equitable financing of our educational plants, from the kin- 
dergarten to the college. The colleges need to and will be taken care 
of, but their cost is small when compared with that of the common 
schools. In my adopted state (Texas) the total biennial expenditure 
by the state for all purposes exceeds forty million dollars; and of this 
amount, twenty-five million dollars goes to education and eleemosy- 
nary work. For some time there have been rumblings of discontent 
against the increasing cost caused by the addition of kindergarten, 
domestic science, music, drawing, manual training, and other subjects. 
 
-P-A-G-E-182

The greater amount of taxes is gradually being paid by a smaller 
per cent of the population; and the business men, who pay most of 
the taxes, are beginning to show a restlessness over this increasing 
cost, for in many cases they do not see they are getting quid pro quo. 
With the influence the business world can exert in matters of legis- 
lation, liberal support for the schools may not be willingly continued 
unless it can be shown to be a good investment. Even the most selfish, 
close-fisted would not object to the expense if it were evident that re- 
turns come to them; for if they knew their investment brought them 
dividends, their opposition would cease and the support would be 
counted an asset and not a liability. 
All agree that all the population must receive some education. The 
only point for discussion among any group is how and how much. 
The business world wants consumers of and customers for its prod- 
ucts. It knows a satisfied customer is a returning customer, and that 
a returning customer is a profitable one. It knows that with any 
meritorious article or product, greater satisfaction is given when 
used with judgment, and that judgment comes from training. The 
business world knows that with increase of culture and taste comes a 
demand for a better grade of products. The savage used clothing and 
housing mainly for protection against the elements; the civilized use 
them largely for adornment and satisfaction. A blanket sufficed for 
the one; a sealskin or a buffalo robe partly soothes the other. 
The business world wants stability of social and economic condi- 
tions. A mob has been defined as a crowd without brains. A lawless 
strike or a group frenzied at some crime or even fancied grievance 
may in a few hours destroy a manufacturing plant, a courthouse, 
stores, or even lives, and thus bring on a community an economic 
loss, ill feeling, and grief that years cannot efface or pay for. The 
trained citizen has poise and is not so led. 
The business world is not devoid of patriotism and philanthropy. 
To go further with the obvious is needless. What the business world 
wants is the best, sanest, safest education at the least expense. Many 
of the business world do not now count the money cost of inefficient 
teaching and teachers. Soon we should agree on what is the duty of 
the state to the child. Thereisa limit. It is not determined whether 
it should be eight, ten, or twelve years. When we decide that, then 
we can profit from the lessons learned in church missionary work. 
Twenty-five years ago small sums were collected for support of mis- 
sionaries in foreign lands. The entire amount then raised seems now 
a mere pittance, and the result, except in isolated cases, was almost 
nothing; for the different denominations all sent men into the same 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
  Third Day,—Maxwell LT 
territory, thus overlapping the work and doing none thoroughly. 
Later men of means contributed larger amounts, and then they began 
to stop the waste of such scattering efforts, divided the territory, put 
business methods into use, gave each denomination a definite field, 
and kept others away. The results show the wisdom. 
When business men realize the state’s duty and know they must 
furnish the means for doing this duty, then it will be to their in- 
terest to provide this with the least expense to them. If the duty of 
the state is to give all its youth the amount of training now given in 
eight, ten, or twelve years, then the business world would seek to elim- 
inate all waste and lost motion. 
The greatest waste to-day in the educational world is lack of prep- 
aration on the part of the teachers. Often they are not proficient 
even in the subject-matter, and a majority are not professionally 
trained. When the business world realizes that an unskilled teacher 
retards pupils, and that a retarded and poorly taught pupil, by staying 
in the grades a longer time, is an expensive financial liability to the 
state, is an economic loss to the world as a producer, is an economic 
loss to the manufacturer as a consumer, and may be a menace to the 
state and property as a discord breeder, then the business world will 
be ready and anxious to remedy the situation. 
Money spent on an efficient teacher-training school will give the 
business world more and larger financial returns than any other in- 
vestment. If our elementary schools all had professionally trained 
teachers, we could get the present efficiency at less than seventy-five 
per cent of the present costs, or we could get one-third more for the 
present expenditure. The business world will be glad and quick to 
see this if properly presented. 
Whether it is for state appropriations in our individual states or 
whether it is for further donations and contributions to the match- 
less institution made possible by that philanthropist, George Peabody, 
whose memory we revere and for whom we are to-day showing our 
appreciation—for this institution, organized by Dr. Sears, guided by 
President W. H. Payne, preserved by Governor Porter, revivified and 
enlarged by President Bruce R. Payne, all being assisted by those who 
have in the past and are-now so ably aiding them, we can go out witha 
message of privilege and opportunity, not a mendicant plea, that ought 
and will bring to us the means to do for the nation, and especially the 
South, what we all long for. In giving the message of privilege we 
can paraphrase the words of the apostle Paul, “Thou that teachest 
another, teachest thou not thyself?” and say to the business world, 
“Thou that givest to Peabody givest to thyself.”

PUBLIC LIFE AS RELATED TO THE TRAINING OF 
TEACHERS AND THE TEACHING PROFESSION 
  
JOSEPH W. COX 
  
This is a day for memories. Amid these splendid new surround- 
ings, many of us have been thinking of the old campus, where was 
carried on the epochal work in the training of teachers which we have 
heard here so vividly described. So you will not be surprised that I 
turn back to the instruction there received to seek the answer to the 
question presented by my theme. 
No one who ever studied under Dr. Wickliffe Rose can ever forget 
the use he made of the allegory, “The Image of the Cave,” found in 
Plato’s “Republic.” One can still almost feel the thrill of expanding 
vision, the widening horizon of thought, as he entwined his philosophy 
of education with the imagery of that allegory and led up to the con- 
ception that the best minds trained in and attaining to the highest 
knowledge and then partaking in the labors and honors of the citi- 
zens, must be the instruments for binding together and lifting up the 
state. In the light of this conception we may discern, it seems to me, 
the relation of public life and the teaching profession. 
D’Artagnan, Aramis, and Quentin Durward had to go up to the 
capital to seek the sovereign when they would serve the state, but with 
us the sovereign is wherever the citizen is found. His education is 
not confined merely to the period of his childhood and youth, but is a 
continuous life process. Accordingly, in the republic the teacher, the 
minister, the lawyer, the physician, the statesman—the men and 
women of the callings professedly devoted primarily to the serving 
of the citizen rather than the making of profit—appear as engaged in 
specialized departments of the same great work. The unity of their 
purpose, the essential identity of their function, must be understood 
and preserved—their purpose, the education of the citizen; their func- 
tion, teaching. 
This is no mere fancy. In actual everyday life a large part of all 
official and professional work is teaching. We are, perhaps, not ac- 
customed to thinking of the lawyer, for example, as a teacher; but, in 
fact, he is continuously teaching. Thereare his clients. With objects 
in mind from which they are not to be diverted, they are not always 
easy subjects to teach. Sometimes they regard the instruction an- 
noying and the tuition high; yet from the poorest prisoner in the dock 
of the police court to the corporation of world-wide activities they
-P-A-G-E-185
Third Day,—Cox 173 
seek and heed our instruction. Then there are the juries and the 
judges. They are paid for listening to the lawyer. They must re- 
ceive his instruction. Yes, even the judges must be taught. They 
tell a story of a lawyer before the great tribunal of which our distin- 
guished toastmaster is so distinguished a member. He was proceed- 
ing to explain in detail the legal propositions on which he relied, when 
the Chief Justice interrupted and suggested that he might assume the 
court was familiar with the elementary principles of the law. To 
which the lawyer replied: “But, your honor, that was just the mis- 
take I made in the court below.” 
The point I wish to make is that a function of the legal profession 
is to teach—to teach the citizen his rights, duties, and obligations 
under the law, the essence of which is righteousness. 
In ways even more obvious, the minister, the physician, the states- 
man, perform the teaching function in the state. Of course, no one 
would suggest that these professions are performing their teaching 
functions with anything like complete efficiency, or that at present 
there is effective codperation or coérdination among them, as with the 
teaching profession. Speaking of my own, I abuse no confidence when 
I say we are in a Titanic struggle to prevent being engulfed in the 
abyss of commercialism. We have raised technical standards for ad- 
mission to the bar, but this has not proved adequate. The trouble 
lies deeper—in ideals. 
So, following a universal trend, we are now turning to the teaching 
profession for help. Experience in teaching has long been regarded 
as ideal training for other professions, and the exceptional qualifica- 
tions of trained teachers for public life is evidenced by the increasing 
frequency with which they have been “drafted” in recent years for 
the highest official positions. But in turning to you now, it is not to 
deplete your ranks to fill ours. We have not much room for you just 
at present. Our hope lies not in depleting your ranks, but rather in 
your ranks being kept filled and trained. 
What we are doing in the hope of maintaining our ancient stand- 
ards is to demand not only better and higher teaching in our law 
schools, but also broader training in liberal studies as a requirement 
for entrance. Our demand thus becomes a call to the teaching pro- 
fession. But plainly unavailing will be our call and vain our hope, 
except there be provision, such as you are making here, to supply 
trained teachers. 
Thus, as we conceive it, the problem of bringing the professions 
exercising the teaching function in the state into codperation and
-P-A-G-E-186
  
174 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
coérdination is largely in the hands of the teaching profession, and 
the key to its solution must be found in the training of teachers. 
It is said that Bernard leavened the civilization of Northern Europe 
by sending out educated men who formed two hundred and fifty cen- 
ters of faith and culture in lands then barbarous. From centers such 
as this College must come the leaven of the highest education which is 
to leaven the whole lump of public life in America. 
THE DAY’S EVENTS AND THE TEACHER 
  
BYRON NORRELL 
Editor Ada (Okla.) News 
  
When a man has crossed the Oklahoma line and inhaled a few deep 
draughts of the atmosphere, he at once feels “chesty.” He feels sorry 
for his friends who must live in other states; for while each may 
think his particular corner of the universe is pretty good, the Okla- 
homan knows his state leads and he begins to tell the world about it. 
As water seeks its level, so we have the pick of all the states of the 
Union. 
Events have moved swiftly with us, especially in the old Indian 
Territory. I have seen a school system in the making, from the log- 
cabin type to one of the largest teachers colleges in the United States, 
located in my home town—and that, too, in the short space of seven- 
teen years. 
The teacher has been the leader in the events that have made our 
school system one of which to be proud and in shaping the destiny of 
the state. With us the teacher is accorded his rightful place among 
men of affairs instead of being merely regarded as a sort of necessary 
nuisance in the community. He is a leader in the community, and 
through his zealous work, often conducting night schools for the ben- 
efit of adults, with no compensation, and through district fairs and 
boys’ and girls’ farm clubs, he has made himself an indispensable 
factor in the development of the country. All this has been duly 
chronicled in the press of the state in the events of the day. 
The press has worked hand in hand with teachers, for the editors 
are glad of the opportunity to help. The columns of the Ada Evening 
News and Weekly News have been open at all times to the teachers, 
and I have urged them to make free use of them as a medium for 
keeping in touch with one another. Now and then we issue special 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
Third Day,—Norrell - 175 
school editions, in which every school in the territory, from the great 
teachers college to the most remote rural district, is represented. 
We make it a point to become personally acquainted with as many 
of the teachers as possible, and through them pick up many newsy 
items and give their districts the publicity to which they are entitled. 
Not many years ago teachers could be found who never read any- 
thing written within half a century of their own times. It never oc- 
curred to them that history was being made and recorded every day; 
that they were factors in making this history the press was publish- 
ing. They never encouraged their pupils to keep informed on the 
news of the day. That idea, luckily, no longer exists. Teachers are 
expected to keep in touch with current events. They are striving to 
make their schools centers about which other activities revolve; hence 
their increased importance as a factor in community life. 
The boy or girl who learns of Aristotle and Cesar and neglects 
Thomas Edison and Calvin Coolidge is getting only half, if that much, 
of his education. Vastly more important to a growing child than the 
movement of troops in Napoleon’s army is the progress made in the 
electrifying of the world at this time. It is more important for the 
lad of fifteen to study soil conservation, dry farming, finance in this 
age, construction of automobiles, irrigation, local government, and 
international credits, laws now in force, than to have all the knowl- 
edge possessed by ancient philosophers and to know accurately the 
history of the last ten thousand years. The teacher who is neglect- 
ing the use of the daily newspaper as a textbook is neglecting the most 
interesting, the most constructive, the cheapest means toward an 
education. Between a classically educated man or woman whose 
mind dwells only in the misty past and another who gets his amo or 
amas mixed, but is alive to the importance of the history that is in 
the making, is alive to the most progressive age the world has known, 
is alive to the fact that she is training boys and girls to think quickly 
and accurately in the light of to-day—if we have to choose between 
these two, the latter is to be preferred. 
Everything has not been easy. Every community has its quota of 
mossbacks, and it is part of the work of the newspapers to help 
counteract their influence by assisting progressive teachers to over- 
come prejudice and time-worn opinions. The average successful edi- 
tor is of necessity an optimist. 
All teachers should get well acquainted with their editors. They 
are working toward the same end. The editor is always ready to help 
the educational interests. The press is the medium which, in record- 
ing current events, connects past and present history. It behooves  
-P-A-G-E-188
  176 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
the educator and the editor to stand together in their common cause. 
The newspapers until recently have neglected two great sources of 
news—the churches and the schools. The idea that church activity 
was news was hooted at a decade ago; to-day it is featured. The 
activity of a God-fearing congregation carries as much interest as the 
brawl of a barroom gang. 
Schools are the largest function of government. They deal with 
humanity in the rough. They form the unhewn stones into nature’s 
greatest product—a serviceable man or woman. To say the school 
work and the school activities are not news is to brand oneself a fool. 
There are good, bad, and indifferent teachers. There are good, bad, 
and indifferent newspapers. The worst of both are being relegated. 
The best are making a new world—a world of luxury and ease, a 
world of happiness, a world of beauty, a world of God. They are 
turning the desert into gardens, eradicating disease, obliterating dis- 
tance and time, and hastening the brotherhood of man. With the 
church as a corollary, they are making life easier, more beautiful, and 
sweeter. 
If you teachers are not getting the codperation of your editors, it 
is your own fault. If your editor is alive to the changing times, he 
wants the news of your school and wants to help you make better men 
and women. If you newspaper men are neglecting the schools as a 
source of news, you are neglecting one of the main ways of tying 
your paper to your community and making it just as stable an institu- 
tion as the schools themselves. 
I catch a vision of the South a quarter of a century hence. Paved 
roads connect all great centers. Every child sits under a well-trained 
teacher in a modern school building. Farms are well equipped and 
manned by educated men who use the forces of nature to save soil and 
drudgery. In it all three great beacons light up every section—the 
ministry, the newspaper, and the teachers. 
We attribute the growth of this country to her natural resources. 
That is not true. South America has more resources and so does 
Mexico. The United States has prospered because its people came 
in search of God and have been led by progressive, aggressive, far- 
seeing editors and God-fearing, self-sacrificing, hard-working teach- 
ers.

RELIGION AND TEACHING 
  
JAMES B. GREEN 
Professor in Columbia (S. C.) Theological Seminary 
  
I like my subject. I like the first word, “religion;” I like the last 
word, “teaching;” and I like the middle word, the little copula “and” 
which unites the other two. Religion and teaching. These two 
things were joined together, not by the makers of this program, but by 
Him who made all things. 
There was a teacher sent from God whose name was “Jesus.” His 
specialty was religion, and one of his methods of propagating his reli- 
gion was teaching. It is written: “And Jesus went about in all Gali- 
lee, teaching, . . . andpreaching, . . . and healing.” When 
he commissioned the twelve to “carry on” after his departure, he 
charged them to “make disciples of all the nations, . . . teaching 
them.” 
From that day to this teaching has been a handmaid of religion. 
Realizing this, Julian, the apostate, in the fourth century, forbade the 
Christians to teach in the schools of the empire. Following the exam- 
ple of the Founder of Christianity, all the most widely and perma- 
nently useful propagators of the Christian religion have sent forth 
teachers, saying, “Let the people know,” believing that knowledge, 
not ignorance, is the mother of devotion. 
Religion has helped teaching not less than teaching has helped reli- 
gion. Of religion in relation to teaching I would say three things. 
1. Religion is a primary qualification for teaching, whatever the 
school or the subject. If the work is legitimate, real religion is a qual- 
ification for its best performance. 
To know is good, and knowledge is indispensable in the teacher; 
but to be is better, for character outranks knowledge in power and 
importance in the educator. It is required of a teacher that he know 
what he wants his pupils to learn; it is even more requisite that he be 
what he wants or should want his pupils to become. Now, religion is 
concerned primarily with being. An American teacher once said: 
“For a teacher to meet his class bare of knowledge is unfortunate, 
but to meet his class lean of soul is fatal.” Religion, pure and unde- 
filed, makes for worth of soul, wealth of spirit, for affluence and influ- 
ence of personality. 
Up among the miners in Germany back in the sixteenth century 
was a teacher who lifted his hat every morning as he came among his  
-P-A-G-E-190
  178 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
pupils. There was the religious spirit, expressing itself in reverence 
for the image of God in man and the unknown possibilities wrapped up 
in boys and girls. From the schoolroom of that teacher came Martin 
Luther, who shook a continent and started an era by his evangelistic 
and educational ministry. 
So if I were charged with the responsibility of selecting teachers of 
our youth, the unreligious and the irreligious would be rejected as dis- 
qualified. 
2. The second thing I would say of religion in relation to teaching 
is that religion is an inspiration for the glad and efficient discharge 
of the duties of this high office. Religion supplies the finest motive 
power. Religion is communion with the Highest; it is knowledge of, 
experience of, the internal and the eternal. It touches and taps the 
dynamic resources of the depths and the heights. What inspired the 
Premier Teacher of the race to come into the world and undertake his 
redemptive enterprise? What but this infinite appreciation of reli- 
gious values and his divine pity for men in their spiritual poverty? 
The prophets before him and the apostles after him—all, indeed, who 
have undertaken effective campaigns of enlightenment and uplift— 
what actuated them? Was it not this: the desire to teach men about 
the Heavenly Father, to lift them above the bondage of the senses, 
and to give them the hope of immortality—in other words, the desire 
to share with men the true riches, the riches which wax not old? 
So if I were given the task of selecting teachers for any school, from 
kindergarten up to or down to the university (take your choice of ex- 
pression), I should require among the qualifications of every appli- 
cant the religious mind and among his incentives the religious motive. 
3. The third thing I would say about religion in its relation to teach- 
ing is that religion supplies the teacher with the noblest ideal and 
objective. What shall the teacher aim at? An income, a salary? 
Well, religion does not suggest that, and the best teacher does not seek 
that first. The teacher inspired by religion is not primarily con- 
cerned about his own income and emoluments, but about the outgo 
from himself and income to others. 
What shall the teacher aim at? Giving information? Alas! Not 
much information can be given; and of the little that is given, much 
is of no practical value, and soon to be lost because unused. A grad- 
uate was thanking her teacher for what he had done for her. She 
said: “I am indebted to you for nearly all that I know.” “O, do not 
speak of such a trifle!” was the teacher’s modest and comforting reply. 
The ideal and objective of the true teacher is not a mind informed 
and full, but a man finely formed and furnished ; not a man instructed
-P-A-G-E-191
  
Third Day,—Green 179 
merely, but a man educed, evoked, and emancipated; a superior and 
dominant personality, whose soul is on top and free from the domina- 
tion—I had almost said the “damnation”’—of things. The aim of 
the teacher who is taught and guided by religion is to help men realize 
their divinely intended lordship and to bring the material into sub- 
jection to the spiritual. Than this no service is more needed by the 
republic and the race. For, as Samuel Strauss, publisher and editor 
of the Villager, said in the Atlantic Monthly recently, “Things are in 
the saddle,” which means that the inferior is riding the superior. 
If this terrific rider is ever unhorsed and spirit set in his seat, religion 
must do it; for, I suppose, few will dissent from Woodrow Wilson’s 
last public utterance—Wilson, who strove to stabilize and pacify the 
world on the enduring foundation of righteousness and truth. He 
said that he saw no hope for our civilization materially unless it be 
redeemed spiritually. Dr. Sikes, president-elect of Clemson College, 
in an address to the Kiwanians of Columbia, S. C., said: “The danger 
in business is that we will let the outside get the better of the inside.” 
This danger is as real in education as in business. It seems to some 
observers that the outside has already got the better of the inside. 
Dr. Sikes declared that his policy as president of Clemson would be to 
look after the inside, to develop it and give it the dominion. That is 
the religious objective—the supremacy of the spiritual over the mate- 
rial, of the eternal over the temporal. 
Daniel Webster was right in his contention that to the traditional 
three R’s of education should be added a fourth—Religion. Religion, 
if not in the curriculum of the school, should at least be in the charac- 
ter of the teacher. The education that leaves heart and conscience 
out of account and makes no provision for their culture is fatally de- 
fective. Education minus religion cannot produce the type of char- 
acter required by the church and the state alike. 
It gives me pleasure to testify to the wholesome religious influence 
of Peabody as I knew it back in the nineties. I met a man at a rail- 
way station in South Carolina two weeks ago. I saw on his baggage: 
“Nashville, Tenn.” I asked him if he lived in Nashville. He said he 
used to, but his home at present is in middle Europe. I told him I 
was coming to Nashville soon to attend the Semicentennial Celebra- 
tion of George Peabody College for Teachers. His face brightened 
as he said: “Yes, and Peabody compares favorably with church schools 
in religious atmosphere and influence.” If George Peabody College 
for Teachers should ever lose this religious spirit, it would cease to 
represent and reproduce the spirit of its founder. 
Religion and teaching—they are joined together in this program and
-P-A-G-E-192
180 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
in this institution ; they are united in the program of the great Teacher 
and his redemptive scheme. Let them be joined together inseparably 
in our lives and in the lives of all who practice the teaching art. 
PEABODY ABROAD 
  
MISS MARY RALEIGH ANDERSON 
Missionary to China 
  
A few weeks ago our alumni secretary sent out a sheet of paper just 
three feet six inches long by actual measurement. It was only a lit- 
tle sheet of paper; but with it Peabody has encircled the globe, for it 
was a list of the sons and daughters of this institution who are teach- 
ing in foreign parts. This morning we were told that the influence 
of Peabody has penetrated to the remotest corners of the South. We 
are proud of this fact, but I wish to go further and say that Peabody 
students are trying to carry her influence to the remotest corners of 
the world. They are in Mexico and in South America; they are in 
Central Africa and in the islands of the sea; they are in the Near East 
and in the Far East, from Syria to Korea and to fair Japan; they are 
in India, in Burma, and in every part of China—in North China, 
South China, East China, West China, Central China, and Manchu- 
ria. And so from all parts of the world to-day loyal hearts are turn- 
ing to our Alma Mater with loving birthday greetings. 
But why have Peabody students gone to the uttermost parts of the 
earth? Is a teachers college responsible for the work of foreign mis- 
sions? I shall speak for China, leaving you to make the application 
to other countries. 
Within the span of the present generation, theologians have chal- 
lenged and foreign mission boards have questioned che position of 
Christian schools as an integral part of mission work; but this con- 
troversy is practically over, and the schools have won a place for 
themselves. From an evangelistic point of view, mission schools have 
proved their right to occupy a place side by side with churches on the 
program of missions. It has been shown that the missionary teacher 
is indeed an evangelistic worker, and it is now conceded that Christian 
schools are the most effective of all the agencies used for the evangeli- 
zation of China. From an educational point of view, a system of mis- 
sion schools, with 214,000 pupils, stands as a witness to the faithful
-P-A-G-E-193
Third Day,—Anderson 181 
efforts of the pioneer teachers; while a modern system of government 
schools, with 4,294,000 pupils, is admittedly a by-product of mission 
work. But these systems were developed before teaching became a 
profession—before the world knew that teachers needed scientific 
training. So it happens that the situation to-day presents a weak- 
ness that seems to constitute a unique opportunity for a great teachers 
college like Peabody. 
The commission of educational experts who visited China in 1922 
spoke quite plainly regarding the lack of trained teachers in mission 
schools. In their report we find the following statements: “When one 
considers the number of primary and middle schools and the empha- 
sis that is placed upon them, and then notices that little or no atten- 
tion is paid to the problem of training teachers for these schools, one 
wonders what the future will be. . . . Figures taken from three 
of the most favored provinces indicate that not over two per cent of 
the Christian elementary school-teachers profess any sort of normal- 
school preparation for their work. . . . Nor is the preparation 
for middle-school teaching much more adequate.”! The commission 
also says: “It would be a safe prophecy that Christian elementary 
education will stand or fall during the next ten years according as it 
awakes or not to the absolute necessity for training its teachers.’? 
This prediction seems to call for a prompt change in mission policies, 
for at present only one-fourth of all the missionary societies working 
in China are contributing anything to the systematic training of 
teachers. 
Not only have we failed to train Chinese teachers for our schools, 
but the number of trained teachers in the missionary force is entirely 
insufficient. Again I quote from the education commission: “We have 
found, as did the recent commission to India, that nearly all educa- 
tional work is still intrusted to men who have had only a theological 
education.” The commission “visited one large mission, which was 
conducting over one hundred and fifty schools—primary, secondary, 
and theological—and found only one man who had had any training 
in the science of teaching. He had been on the field less than a year, 
and was teaching in a middle school.” They found another man, 
“trained and sent to the field as a teacher of systematic theology, but 
placed . . . as superintendent of a system of primary schools— 
a task for which, by his own complaint, he had no preparation or 
liking.’’8

Viewed from this angle, the group of Peabody students abroad 
seems large; but compared with the urgent need for trained teachers 
on the field, it is very small. Our beloved President Payne and our 
professors here have shown their interest in enlarging this group, 
and it is growing rapidly. One great denomination so thoroughly 
appreciates the advantages offered by Peabody for missionaries in 
training that it has located its Mission Training School near this 
campus. Would that all denominations were as wise! Peabody also 
offers unusual opportunities for educational missionaries at home on 
furlough and for foreign students who come seeking the highest Amer- 
ican ideals along the line of education. Peabody is thus serving the 
cause of foreign missions in a very effective way ; but perhaps the time 
has come when she can also make another kind of contribution which 
will mean a still larger service, for the present situation in China is 
not entirely due to the scarcity of trained teachers on the field. There 
is another factor which is perhaps more serious. In the work of 
most of our leading denominations the foreign mission secretaries at 
home, who plan and organize the educational work on mission fields, 
are men who have given little thought and no serious study to educa- 
tional problems. Does it not seem that foreign mission boards in 
America should be reorganized in such a way that mission schools 
would be placed under professional leadership? Each year we are 
giving millions of dollars to our mission boards for educational work 
on foreign fields. Is not the commission right in saying that their 
present policies are too wasteful to be continued? 
A few years ago one of the oldest foreign mission boards in Amer- 
ica adopted policies under which their teachers in Canton could not 
work. These teachers resigned in a body, and, with Oberlin as their 
home base, established a new system of schools under a new board 
composed of educators. Unaided, but also unhampered, by their 
board of theologians, they accomplished more in three years than 
they had been able to accomplish in thirty years under the old régime. 
From another mission, the second largest in South China and a mis- 
sion which has a very large system of schools, at least ten trained 
teachers have resigned during the past five years because of reac- 
tionary measures adopted by their mission and their board. The 
positions of these trained teachers were all filled by men and women 
untrained in the art of teaching, while some of the ten teachers went 
into evangelistic work for which they had had no professional train- 
ing, some joined the educational work of other missions, and some 
came home with their hopes shattered. In both of these missions the 
differences of opinion were along professional lines, there being no 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
Third Day,—Anderson 183 
theological differences in either case. You will not be surprised to 
hear that these two groups of resigning missionaries included the three 
South China representatives of the Peabody alumni. 
It is difficult to know just what reorganization is needed and just 
how the teachers colleges of America might help in bringing about a 
proper relation of foreign missions to the teaching profession; but 
the report of the education commission deserves the attention of the 
Christian educational leaders in America, while the condition of the 
little children in China is a silent plea for better mission schools. 
If you should visit the mission schools in China to-day, you would 
find several colleges whose degrees are conferred by the regents of the 
University of the State of New York, and in the large centers you 
would find a few middle schools that are well organized, staffed, and 
equipped. But the condition of most of the elementary and middle 
schools would make you weep. To-day I should like to tell you about 
the few schools that maintain high standards of which we are so 
proud, for these are the schools in which many Peabody alumni are 
working; but instead I am going to leave with you a plea for the 
many schools that are so sadly in need of trained teachers, and so I 
am going to give you a message from a little Chinese boy. His mother 
is an efficient Chinese teacher, and she used to tell him bedtime sto- 
ries. One night he said: “Mother, I am going to tell you a story to- 
night. I am going to tell you a parable. Once a man had a great 
many sheep. He loved his sheep, and every night he would go out 
himself to see if they were safe in the fold. One night it was cold 
and rainy, and the shepherd was anxious about his sheep; so he went 
out through the rain, and, finding his undershepherd, he said: ‘Are 
all my sheep safe in the fold?’ And the undershepherd said: ‘Yes, 
master, all of your sheep have been safely gathered in.’ But the shep- 
herd said: ‘I am anxious about my sheep to-night. It is very dark 
and cold. Are you sure they are all in the fold?’ The undershep- 
herd answered: ‘Yes, master, do not let your heart be troubled. Every 
one of your sheep is safe in the fold.’ But still the shepherd was not 
satisfied, and, looking out into the dreary darkness, he said: ‘Well, 
what is that I see out yonder? It looks like sheep.’ The undershep- 
herd tossed his head and said: ‘O, they are just the little lambs; they 
don’t count.’ ” 
Can you see the millions of little Chinese children whose innocent 
hands are burning incense to their ancestors and to their idols? Then 
can you see the thousands of others who are in our poorer type of 
mission schools, where they sit all day at high desks and do nothing

but memorize long pages of Chinese classics and theological doctrines 
that mean nothing to them? They are just the little lambs. In the 
heart of Peabody I know they count. 
At the close of the alumni luncheon the following telegram from a 
very loyal and honored friend of Peabody was read by Justice Edward 
T. Sanford, the presiding officer, and was enthusiastically received by 
the audience:

GEORGE PEABODY: THE GREAT STEWARD* 
  
JAMES F. MUIRHEAD 
London Editor 
  
Nearly 300 years ago a certain Lieutenant Francis Paybody, or 
Peabody, quitted the old abbey town of St. Albans (Herts) and emi- 
grated to the scantily-peopled shores of New England, where he be- 
came the first of an extraordinarily worthy and numerous stock of 
American citizens. One of these was George Peabody, born on Feb- 
ruary 18th, 1795, at the Massachusetts village of South Danvers, since 
named Peabody in his honour. 
That his parents were not too well endowed with the material gifts of 
fortune may be gathered from the fact that little George was appren- 
ticed to the village grocer at the age of eleven. At fourteen, after a 
short time in his brother’s employment, he became assistant to a haber- 
dasher uncle, whose business was in Georgetown, now part of the 
capital city of Washington (D. C.). Then, though still under age, 
he volunteered for service in the war of 1812, and spent a year or so 
at Fort Warburton, Maryland. In 1814, when only nineteen, he be- 
came a partner in the “dry goods store” of Elisha Riggs, also of 
Georgetown. Mainly through the capacity and energy of the new

and youthful manager the business prospered amazingly, and when 
Riggs retired about 1880 Peabody found himself at the head of one 
of the biggest enterprises of its kind in the world. 
Peabody had already visited England in 1827, and had apparently 
come to the conclusion that London offered a wider and more prom- 
ising field than America for his peculiar talents. In 1837, therefore, 
he established himself at Wanford Court, in the City of London, as a 
merchant and money-broker, founding a business which was eventu- 
ally continued by the famous firm of J. P. Morgan & Co. His special 
function was to facilitate trade between English merchants and the 
United States. For his services he charged a commission of 5 per 
cent, instead of the 10 per cent hitherto asked by the brokers; and, by 
turning his money over four times a year, he eventually enjoyed an 
annual income varying from £60,000 to £100,000. One factor of his 
success was his patriotic investment in United States Civil War Bonds. 
He was one of the three Commissioners that helped the State of 
Maryland to regain her financial equipoise in 1848—a service for 
which he refused pay. His series of munificent gifts for public pur- 
poses (hereinafter detailed) brought him a gold medal and vote of 
thanks from the U. S. Congress and the offer of a baronetcy from 
Queen Victoria. This honour he felt compelled, as an American citi- 
zen (which he remained to the last), to decline; but he accepted a 
valuable miniature portrait of Her Majesty, now in the Peabody In- 
stitute of his native place. In the autograph letter that accompanied 
the portrait, the Queen described Peabody’s donation to London as 
“an act wholly without parallel.” 
Peabody died on November 4th, 1869, at the house of his friend, 
Sir Curtis Lampson, in Eaton Square. His body lay in state for 
some days in Westminster Abbey, and was afterwards conveyed to 
America in the turreted ironclad Monarch, one of the chief ships of 
the British Navy. He was finally laid to rest in Harmony Grove 
Cemetery, at Peabody, on February 8th, 1870, when the Hon. W. C. 
Winthrop delivered a striking funereal panegyric. 
Such is the bare outline of Peabody’s career. It was the life of a 
capable, clear-headed, honourable, and successful man of business. 
From the nature of the case it is evident that he could hardly be 
called a highly educated man; and he never aspired to the réle of 
Mecenas either of arts or letters—a réle that has appealed to so many 
other millionaires. He never married, and he founded no family, 
though he left generous sums to his surviving relatives. The amount 
of money he gave away for philanthropic purposes during his life 
(apparently between 114 and 2 millions sterling) has often been
-P-A-G-E-198
186 Peabody Semicentennial Celebration 
exceeded in these later days of the multi-millionaire. But it can be 
confidently asserted that in the constellations of philanthropy there 
is no brighter star than the new Georgium Sidus, which has so wor- 
thily revived the discarded name of the planet Uranus. 
Someone has described testamentary bequest as “the painted sep- 
ulchre of alms;” Lord Lytton wrote that “charity is an aristocratic 
emotion—the easiest virtue to practise.” One is often inclined to 
endorse this view when considering the donations given as crumbs 
from the superfluous millions of men who used their great wealth in a 
thousand other ways to satisfy their ambition and their love of power. 
But of Peabody it may be truly said, as Cicero said of a certain pluto- 
crat of his acquaintance, that “he amassed wealth, not for the sake of 
avarice, but as an instrument for doing good.” As his friend, Mr. 
Severn T. Wallis, wrote: “He made benevolence his business and en- 
joyed it. Its merely sympathetic guise did not seem to attract him.” 
During the first half of his life he concentrated on the making of 
money and the demonstration of his business capacity. During his 
later years, however, he may be quite truthfully described as a man 
who lived on the very modest salary of the Steward of a Philanthropic 
Fund. It has been authoritatively stated that during his last ten 
years his annual personal expenditure never exceeded £600. He lived 
in bachelor’s quarters; he kept no valet; he never owned a horse; 
he wore no jewellery; he was a total abstainer; his recreations were 
Scots songs, angling, backgammon, and whist—played, we may be 
sure, for “love.” He owned to a naturally parsimonious disposition 
and could not force himself to luxurious personal expenditure. At 
the height of his fortune he preferred to walk rather than employ a 
cabman who demanded more than his legal fare. All the more honour 
to him that he brought himself to a point where he could give away 
so lavishly the money he shrank from spending on himself. By his 
charity, as has been said, he stamped the image of God on his money 
and made it pass current for the merchandise of heaven. 
Though Peabody’s general habits were simple and homely, he was 
not so bloodless as to be incapable of an occasional outburst of display. 
Among these were the banquets he gave at the Crystal Palace on July 
Ath to promote good feeling between England and America. These 
were attended by statesmen, financiers, merchant princes, and other 
men of note. A certain Society, with July 4th as its birthday and not 
unknown to readers of THE LANDMARK, may well feel honoured by 
having so distinguished a forerunner in this particular kind of cele- 
bration. Indeed, for nearly forty years George Peabody was a sort 
of little English-Speaking Union in his own person.

George Peabody,—Muirhead 187 
Of Peabody’s long list of benefactions we may note in general that 
they aimed at prevention rather than cure; they were concerned with 
the seed rather than with the crop. He was a strong believer in “Ed- 
ucation: a debt due from present to future generations.” Under this 
head come the $250,000 he gave for the Peabody Institute at Danvers; 
the $1,500,000 represented by the Peabody Institute at Baltimore, 
founded for the encouragement of science, art, and general knowl- 
edge; and the $3,000,000 or so devoted to educational establishments 
in the Southern States, including the Peabody College for Teachers 
at the pleasant Tennessee city of Nashville, now attended by at least 
8,000 students. His gifts to the South testify not only to his belief 
in education, but also to his firm conviction of the necessity of binding 
up “the fresh and broken wounds of the nation.” “This I give to the 
suffering South for the good of the whole country.” 
George Peabody’s gift to London, his adopted home, amounted to 
£500,000, which, in the careful hands of the Governors of the Peabody 
Donation Fund, has increased to a capital value of over £2,000,000, 
though fully as much has been expended on land and buildings. True 
to his ruling principle, he did not devote this sum to the relief of the 
hopelessly “down and out.” His object was to improve the conditions 
and so to increase the efficiency of the less well-paid classes of work- 
ers by providing them with decent homes at a reasonable rent. 
The Peabody Model Dwellings erected with this fund in different 
parts of London now accommodate a population of over 22,000, at 
rents varying from 2s. 4d. a week for a single room to 10s. 3d. a week 
for a cottage of five rooms. The average rate per room is 3s. 2d. 
George Peabody is commemorated in London by a statue (by W. 
W. Story) behind the Royal Exchange. At the unveiling of this in 
1871, Mr. Motley, the American Minister, quoted appropriately the 
epitaph of an old Earl of Devon: “What I spent, that I had; what I 
saved, that I lost; what I gave away remains with me.” A replica of 
this statue has been erected at Baltimore. Perhaps an even more 
honourable memorial is the inscribed slab in the nave of Westminster 
Abbey, near the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior. Yet another me- 
morial is the name of Peabody Bay, in Greenland, referring to his 
generous contribution to the cost of Dr. Kane’s expedition in search 
of Sir John Franklin. In this connection, too, may be mentioned the 
church he erected at Georgetown to the memory of his mother, of 
which Whittier wrote: 
“The heart, and not the hand, has wrought, 
From sunken base to tower above, 
The image of a tender thought, 
The memory of a deathless love.”

George Peabody has been described as “America’s First Great 
Merchant, First Great Peacemaker, First Great Philanthropist, The 
South’s First Great Friend.” Surely grateful Britons may well add 
to this “First Great Solver of the Housing Problem and First Great 
Apostle of Anglo-American Friendship.”

  PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION 
PRINCIPAL CHANGES IN TEXT 
The present volume introduces many changes in text 
and many additions. The first nine pages are entirely 
new. The section on Vision, from pages 86 to 128, are 
entirely new and prepared by a specialist in vision, 
Professor H. M. Johnson, of the Ohio State University. 
Considerable new material (pages 208 to 212) is given 
in the chapter on Glands. The author’s Johns Hopkins 
experiments in the conditioned emotional reaction will 
be found on pages 233 to 236. The gist of the whole 
paper on thinking as expressed at the meeting of the 
International Congress of Philosophy and Psychology 
will be found on pages 346 to 356. 
Since 1919, when this book was first published, behaviorism 
has been passing through an emotional and logical evaluation. 
Whether it is to become a dominant system of psychology or to 
remain merely a methodological approach is still not decided. 
The strong reaction for and against behaviorism points to the 
fact that psychological students are restless. Nor will they lie 
down and sleep, nor turn to the doings of other things until 
their trial and error wanderings bring an adjusting formulation. 
Most of the younger psychologists realize that some such 
formulation as behaviorism is the only road leading to science. 
Functional psychology cannot help. It died of its own half- 
heartedness before behaviorism was born. Freudianism cannot 
help. Where it is more than a technique it is an emotional de- 
fense of a hero. It can never'serve as a support for a scientific 
formulation. Hence behaviorism must be looked upon as the 
rough scientific clay which all must shape or else rest content 
with the deistic idol already fashioned, and worshipped by 
structural psychology. 
The form of behaviorism the present author has stood for is 
now suffering a most serious set-back at the hands of those who 
are structuralists at heart, yet who profess to be behaviorists-—

“c ” and since behaviorism has become ‘‘ respectable ’’ many who 
know little of its tenets claim to believe in it. Such half-way 
behaviorism and such half-way behaviorists must necessarily 
do harm to the movement because, unless its tenets are kept dis- 
tinct, its terms will become cluttered-up, meaningless and ob- 
secure. This is what has happened to functional psychology. If 
behaviorism is ever to stand for anything (even a distinct 
method), it must make a clean break with the whole concept of 
consciousness. Such a clean break is possible because the meta- 
physical premises of behaviorism are different from those of 
structural psychology. 
Behaviorism is founded upon natural science; structural 
psychology is based upon a crude dualism, the roots of which 
extend far back into theological mysticism. Prof. K. S. 
Lashley’s brilliant formulation (Psychological Review, July, 
1923) of behavioristie contentions shows that any student loathe 
to give up ‘‘ consciousness ’’ with all of its past complications 
should find happier sailing on some other craft. 
Since the origin of behaviorism is now under discussion, the 
preface ‘to the 1924 edition may “‘fitly carry a word about the 
author’s connection with the behavioristie approach. His 
researches in animal psychology, stimulated first by Lloyd 
Morgan’s work and then, more powerfully, by Thorndike led hint 
to his first conversational formulation in 1903. This formula- 
tion was not encouraged. He was told that it would work for 
animals, ] but not for human beings. The author’s first public 
expression was in the form of a lecture before the Psychology 
Department of Yale University in 1908. The sentiment there 
likewise was against it. It was called psychology at a deserip- 
tive level; and the conviction was expressed that psychology 
could never be satisfied with anything short of ‘‘ explanation ’’! 
How a parallelistic psychology could be explanatory was not 
brought out! 
The author then let his formulation rest until called upon to 
give a course of public lectures at Columbia in the fall of 1912. 
The paper published in the Psychological Review in March,

1913—“‘ Psychology from the Standpoint of a Behaviorist ’’— 
gave a part of the first of these lectures. As a result of these 
lectures the author was challenged to cope with image and affec- 
tion. This he attempted to do before the Psychological Semi- 
nary of Columbia University in April, 19138. The paper— 
““Tmages and Affection in Behavior ’’-—summarizes the result 
of this attempt. 
The next systematic attempt at a non-controversial formu- 
lation is to be seen in the 1919 edition of this book. 
The chapter on thinking became the subject of dis- 
cussion at the British International Congress of Phil- 
osophy and Psychology held at Cambridge in 1920. The 
author’s paper—‘‘Is Thinking Merely the Action of 
Language Mechanism ’’—published in the October, 1920, 
number of the British Journal of Psychology, attempted to 
give clearer expression to his views on thinking than was done 
in the 1919 book. The only attempt the author has made to 
sketch a genetic experimental program which would justify be- 
haviorism as a method, is published in The Scientific Monthly, 
December, 1921 (in collaboration with Rosalie Rayner Watson) 
—‘‘ Studies in Infant Psychology.”’ 
Although Professor Knight Dunlap cannot be accused of 
favoring a systematic behaviorism, nevertheless his treatment of 
the ‘‘ image ’’ (destructive as it is of the ‘‘centrally aroused 
sensation ’’) was a primary factor in the formulation of the 
author’s paper ‘‘ Image and Affection in Behavior ’’. 
The author wishes to express his deep obligation to the firm 
of J. B. Lippincott Company for long-continued patience in 
meeting his wishes as to reprintings, textual changes and the like.

PREFACE 
Civilized nations are rapidly becoming city dwellers. With 
this increase in the concentration of homes there come changes in 
our habits and customs. Life becomes complex. The strain of 
adjusting ourselves to others increases daily. We are just waking 
up to the fact that while chemistry and physics, or rather their 
industrial applications—by giving us light, heat, telephones and a 
thousand other indispensable luxuries—have provided the motives 
for our living together, they are helpless when called upon to 
teach us how to dwell together wisely and happily. 
Our schools and colleges, constructed as they are to fit the 
needs of a past generation, cast us forth ill prepared to solve the 
problems that come from living in complex groups. We carry 
away from them only a scant knowledge of ourselves and even 
less equipment for understanding the behavior of others. 
If weare ever to learn to live together in the close relationships 
demanded by modern social and industrial life we shall have to 
leave behind for a time our interest in chemistry and physics and 
even our interest in physiology and medicine, and enter upon a 
study of modern psychology. 
Fortunately, psychology is prepared to help us. The past ten 
years have seen the development of new points of view in 
psychology—points of view that have grown up partly to meet 
our ever changing social needs and partly because the very existence 
of these needs has made a new viewpoint possible. In order to be 
of help psychology had first to break the strangle hold philosophy 
and academic tradition had upon it and to find courage to seek its 
facts in the daily lives of human beings. 
One of the most recent and practical of these new viewpoints 
in psychology is that of the behaviorists. The present volume 
gives for the first time a systematic presentation of this trend. 
Behavioristic psychology or behaviorism, as it is sometimes called, 
contends that the most fruitful starting point for psychology is 
x     
-P-A-G-E-10
  xii PREFACE 
  the study not of our own self but of our-neighbor’s behay 
other words it assumes that the student should take the view that 
the most interesting and helpful method is the study of what other 
human beings do and why they do it. Only by so doing ean 
we ever hope to understand our own behavior. Those-who 
have any familiarity with the psychology current a few years 
ago will realize that this reverses the method of study recom- 
mended by Wundt and William James and of many of our other 
most prominent psychologists. 
Psychologists of this somewhat older school are called intro- 
spectionists. They maintain that the starting point in psychology 
is the study of one’s own mind. You are supposed somehow to 
halt from moment to moment your ordinary daily activities 
and to analyze the accompanying “mental states’’ in terms of 
‘sensations,’ ‘images,’ and ‘the affective tones’ present. You are 
supposed for example to halt a strong emotion in its course and 
describe where the ‘sensations’ are localized and determine what 
‘imagery’ is present and whether the whole experience is ‘pleasant’ 
or ‘painful,’ ete. 
This type of procedure in psychology turned out to be bad 
both from the standpoint of the individual’s continued interest in 
the subject and for the progress of psychology as a science. The 
difficulty of making such observations upon himself caused the 
individual to lose hope almost immediately of ever understanding 
either himself or any one else. Historically this method has 
produced a set of laboratory studies almost devoid of human 
interest and a series of text books with which only a philosopher 
can cope. 
To the general student of psychology the present: behavioristic 
viewpoint’ is a welcome one. He is used to observing things 
objectively. His daily life has taught him to do so. Hence when 
he comes to behaviorism he does not feel a transition in method or 
any change in subject matter. He is not confronted with definitions 
of ‘consciousness,’ ‘sensation,’ or of ‘image,’ ‘perception’ and the 
like but with definite concrete problems which he can solve 
by observing the behavior of others. Put in concrete form 
behaviorism’s primary contention is that if its facts were all at

PREFACE xiii 
hand the behaviorist would be able to tell after watching an individual 
perform an act what the situation is that caused his action (prediction), 
whereas if organized society decreed that the individual or growp should 
act in a definite, specific way the behaviorist could arrange the situation 
or stimulus which would bring about such action (control). In other 
words Psychology from the Standpoint of the Behavorist is con- 
cerned with the prediction and control of human action and not 
with an analysis of ‘consciousness’. 
On a first reading the non-technical student is advised to omit 
Chapters IV and V. They are concerned mainly with the nervous 
system, muscles and glands. Their omission will in no way inter- 
fere with an understanding of the behaviorist’s point of view.

  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
My heaviest obligation is to Dr. Adolf Meyer and to the staff 
of the Phipps Psychiatric Clinic before whom the manuscript 
was read as it was prepared. In numerous instances, under the 
kindly criticism received there, the text has been altered for the 
better. Captain H. M. Johnson, Dr. K. 8. Lashley, Dr. J. L. 
Ulrich and Dr. N. D. C. Lewis have given generously of their 
time in reading the manuscript and proof. Each one has made 
helpful suggestions. I am greatly indebted to Prof. Max Broedel 
of the Art Department of the Johns Hopkins Medical School 
and to two of his assistants, Miss G. L. Meakin and Miss A. 
Motter, who, under his direction, made the excellent drawings 
of the nervous system after Dr. Florence Sabin had kindly made 
the dissections. Miss Meakin also made the drawings of the 
larynx after Dr. Warren Lewis had placed the material at our 
disposal. Dr. Samuel M. Burka has assisted me greatly in the 
preparation of the cuts and photographs of the infants. 
In 1917, upon recommendation of Dr. J. McK. Cattell, the 
sum of one hundred dellars was appropriated by the Committee 
on Grants for Research of the American Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Science for my assistance in studying the develop- 
ment of reflexes and instincts in infants. The expenses for the 
genetic work summarized in the text were defrayed in part by 
the above grant. I wish to make a grateful acknowledgment for 
this aid. 
Finally, I have borrowed generously from many authors. 
Where the material has been often quoted in the past I have made 
no reference to the author. Where it is of the research type I 
have usually put the author’s name in parentheses with no fur- 
ther reference. The student hungering for further work cannot 
be too early trained to use the Psychological Index.

PSYCHOLOGY 
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A BEHAVIORIST 
CHAPTER I 
PROBLEMS AND SCOPE OF PSYCHOLOGY 
Medieval Tradition Has Kept Psychology From Becom- 
ing a Science.—Psychology, up to very recent times, has been 
held so rigidly under the dominance both of traditional religion 
and of philosophy—the two great bulwarks of medivalism— 
that it has never been able to free itself and become a natural 
science. Chemistry and physics have freed themselves. Zoology 
and physiology are now in the process of becoming emancipated. 
That they are encountering difficulties is shown by the almost 
perennial agitation against the teaching of evolution. 
In the late sixties an attempt was made to make an experi- 
mental science of psychology. The boast was voiced that the 
psychology growing out of this attempt had become a science 
without a soul—that is, a natural science. Notwithstanding 
the establishment of many laboratories both here and abroad, it 
has never been able to substantiate this claim. 
Its Subject Matter Not Objective.—The reason for its fail- 
ure was largely its limitation of subject matter and choice of 
method. Psychology limited its subject matter to the so-called 
states of consciousness—their analysis and synthesis. ‘‘ States 
of consciousness,’’ like the so-called phenomena of spirit- 
ualism, are not objectively verifiable and for that reason can 
never become data for science. 
In all other sciences the facts of observation are objective, 
verifiable and can be reproduced and controlled by all trained : 
observers. For example, the physiologist may note an increase 
in respiration in his animal under certain conditions; the 
physiological chemist may find that the increased rate is due to 
the presence of a certain chemical circulating in the blood; the 
7 1  
-P-A-G-E-16
2 PSYCHOLOGY 
  physical chemist can, after proper study, find out the exact 
constitution of that chemical substance, its weight, structure and 
ionic relationships. In other words, data of science (verified 
observation) are common property and the methods of science 
are the same in principle, however much they may vary in form. 
There is, however, among the true natural sciences a division 
of labor and a division of needs. We can illustrate this. 
Thyroxin—the thyroid hormone—will call out one group of 
experiments from the animal physiologist, another from the 
medical specialist in glandular diseases, and still another from 
the physical chemist. Psychology, on the other hand, as a science 
of ‘‘ consciousness,’’ has no such community of data. It cannot 
share them, nor can other sciences use them. Not only can 
psychologist A not share his data with physicist A, but also he 
cannot share them with his brother psychologist B. Even if 
they existed, they would exist as isolated, unusuable 
“* mental ’’ curiosities. 
Introspection a Serious Bar to Progress.—The psychol- 
ogists’ use of ‘‘ introspection ’’ as its principal method has been 
another very serious bar to progress. The method of introspec- 
tion—the looking inward to see what goes on in one’s own mind— 
has been the principal method employed by structural 
psychologists. One is supposed to need several years’ training 
in a psychological laboratory in the observation of the kaleido- 
scopic changes that go on every moment in states of conscious- 
ness before one’s introspection takes on a scientific character. 
This training supposedly gives one facility to take one’s own 
states of consciousness and subject them to analysis. In other 
words, the introspectionist claims to become adept in reducing 
complex states to still simpler states until finally he reaches irre- 
ducible data called sensations and affective tones. 
So far the psychologist on this basis has never been able to 
do anything but analyze—and only his own past states at that. 
Synthesis, the method sine qua non of modern science has been 
found to be impossible in psychology. All that introspective 
psychology has been able to contribute is the assertion that 
1 The behaviorist finds no evidence for “ mental existences ” or “ mental 
processes ” of any kind.
-P-A-G-E-17
PROBLEMS AND SCOPE OF PSYCHOLOGY 3 
mental states are made up of several thousand irreducible units; 
for example, the thousands of sensation units like redness, green- 
ness, coldness, warmth, and the like, and their ghosts called 
images, and the affective irreducibles, pleasantness and’ un- 
pleasantness (possibly six of the latter if we include strain and 
relaxation, and excitement and calm). ( 
But the truth or falsity of this assertion is inconsequential, 
since no other human being can make an introspective observa- 
tion upon anyone but himself. Whether there are ten irreducible 
sensations or a hundred thousand (even granting their existence), 
whether there are two affective tones or fifty, matters not one 
whit to that organized body of world-wide data we call science. 
Introspective Psychology no Longer Serviceable-—The 
psychology begun by Wundt has thus failed to become a science 
and has still more deplorably failed in contributing anything 
of a scientifically usable kind to human nature—in helping people 
to understand why they behave as they do and how to modify 
their behavior ; and how to bring up the youths in their charge to 
act in such a way that the youths can live, move and have their 
being in society, and not have their own individuality swamped 
and flattened out by society. 
Psychology Needs a Re-examination of Its Premises.— 
One reason why psychology made this false start under Wundt 
is because it would not bury its past. It tried to hang on to 
tradition with one hand and to push forward as a science with 
the other. Before progress could be made in astronomy, it had 
to bury astrology; neurology had to bury phrenology; and 
chemistry had to bury alchemy. But the social sciences, 
psychology, sociology, political science and economics, will not 
bury their ‘‘ medicine men.’’ According to the opinion of many 
scientific men today, psychology even to exist longer, not to 
speak of becoming a true natural science, must bury subjective 
subject matter, introspective method and present terminology. 
Consciousness, with its structural units, the irreducible sensa- 
tions (and their ghosts, the images) and their affective tones, 
and it’ processes, attention, perception, conception, is but an 
indefinable phrase. Whatever scientific value there is in the 
colossal number of volumes written in terms of consciousness can 
ok
-P-A-G-E-18
4 PSYCHOLOGY 
be better defined and expressed when the psychological prob- 
lems which gave rise to them are solved by genuine objective 
scientific methods. 
Behaviorism—the Natural Science Approach to Psychol- 
ogy.—Believing that these arguments against the prevailing 
and current presuppositions of psychology were correct, 
behaviorism, first showing its head in 1912, attempted to make 
a fresh, clean start in psychology, breaking both with current 
theories and with traditional concepts and terminology. For 
the behaviorist, psychology is that division of natural science 
which takes human behavior-—-the doings and sayings, both 
learned and unlearned, of people as its subject matter. It is the 
study of what people do from even before birth until death. 
Every human being is active throughout the whole of his life. 
Activity begins at the beginning of embryological development 
and continues without interruption until death. Man’s activity 
during this period has its high tides and low tides. During sleep, 
coma or paralysis it seems reduced to the absolute minimum, 
both in amount and in kind. Again both amount and kind of 
activity vary from infancy through childhood, adolescence, 
adulthood and old age. 
Ceaseless Organization and Reorganization of Behavior.— 
During the first year of man’s existence we find some, but com- 
paratively few, highly organized unlearned acts (‘‘ instincts ’’). 
We find a multitudinous group of poorly integrated reflexes 
consisting of kicking, slashing with the hands and feet, and 
wriggling of the whole body, and of movements of the vocal 
cords. Two or three years later we find that some of the unlearned 
acts have come over intact, others appear in modified form, while 
still others have been lost. We find progress too in the codrdina- 
tion or chaining together of the loosely knit acts into what we 
call ‘‘ learnings ’’ or habits. He now reacts definitely and con- 
nectedly, with hands, feet, trunk, to a variety of situations. He 
reacts definitely with words and groups of words to many differ- 
ent verbal situations. 
‘When we examine him still later we find him possessed of a 
still more complex system of habits but almost wholly different 
from those he had when he was last under observation. He 
adn:   
-P-A-G-E-19
  
  PROBLEMS AND SCOPE OF PSYCHOLOGY 5 
dresses himself, speaks conventionally, has established social 
habits, goes to school, reads, and writes. 
If we examine him at maturity, the complexity in his habit 
organization seems too great for us to measure in any way. He 
‘indulges in many acts of skill, has a well developed system of 
vocational activity, has married and is rearing a family, has 
become interested in world politics, in schools and the like. 
Behaviorism Attempts to Find the Principles Underlying 
Changes in Behavior.—Behavioristic psychology attempts to 
formulate, through systematic observation and experimentation, 
the generalizations, laws and principles which underly man’s 
behavior. When a human being acts—does something with 
arms, legs or vocal cords—there must be an invariable group of 
antecedents serving as a ‘‘ cause ’’ of the act. For this group 
of antecedents the term situation or stimulus is a convenient 
term. When an individual is placed face to face with some 
Sra fire, a menacing animal or human, a change in 
fortune—he will do something, even if he only stands still or 
faints. Psychology is thus confronted immediately with two 
problems—the one of predicting the probable causal situation 
or stimulus giving rise to the response; the other, given the 
situation, of predicting the probable response. 
(1) Observing the Response, to Predict the Probable 
Situation —The first problem is to study man in action, from 
birth to old age, in such a way that the behaviorist, with reason- 
able certainty when watching the individual behave can tell 
what the situation or stimulus is that calls out the act—ie., 
ean scientifically define the stimulus. 
Let use take a very homely illustration: A neighbor sees 
his friend leaving the house at 7:54 in the morning just in 
time to catch the Commuters’ Special at 8:15. Two blocks from 
the house the man stops, searches in all his pockets, then sud- 
denly runs back to the house. The neighbor says: ‘‘ Humph, 
George forgot his commutation ticket again. He’s always 
doing it.’? The observer has predicted the stimulus or situation 
calling forth the act, partly through the present behavior of 
his friend and partly through the data he has on the nest 
behavior of his friend. This illustration is so commen-place    
-P-A-G-E-20
    6 : PSYCHOLOGY 
that it seems a travesty to use it as an example of scientific but 
practical procedure. And yet problems similar in kind, but 
requiring more knowledge to make serviceable answers, are 
constantly confronting psychologists. Why do men go to war? 
Why do some men fight evolution? Why did George Smith 
leave his wife? Why do employees leave my organization after 
one or two months of service? Why does Henry Doe live in the 
gutter when he is strong and has a good technical education? 
Why will a democratic nation every now and then elect a non- 
entity for a president? All such behavior has just as definable 
a series of ‘‘ causes ’’ as has a volcanic eruption which engulfs 
a hundred cities. This side of psychology has been written 
about and studied in a hit or miss way by sociologists, econ- 
omists, journalists and many others. These students feel that 
they have a right (and they have as good a right as, if not better 
than, the present-day psychologists) to write about this aspect 
of behavior. Unfortunately the answers returned are rarely 
serviceable. The explanation is given in terms of some phases 
of the original nature of man about which we have almost no 
facts. To answer them correctly we need to have definite 
reproduceable data concerning man’s unlearned behavior; on 
what various learnings he has annexed; on what traditional 
factors are influencing his group; on the present social customs 
he follows; on what effects schools and churches have had upon 
his development. To answer any of the ‘‘ whys’’ adequately 
about human activity we need to study man as the chemist needs 
to study some new organic compound. Psychologically, man is 
still a reacting piece of unanalyzed protoplasm. 
(2) Given the Situation, to Predict the Probable Response.— 
The other equally important aspect of psychology is so to 
experiment with man’s behavior from infancy to old age that, 
given the situation or stimulus, we are able to predict the 
probable response. 
Socially we meet many practical problems in this aspect of 
behavior psychology. Russia has a Soviet form of government 
following immediately upon hundreds of years of monarchical 
government of an autocratic kind. What changes in behavior 
will this situation bring in the lives of the individuals in Russia?
-P-A-G-E-21
   PROBLEMS AND SCOPE OF PSYCHOLOGY ’ 
Again in this country a new situation has been set up by the 
enactment of the Eighteenth Amendment. Before establishing 
this situation we should have been able to predict the changes 
in behavior such an amendment would bring. What effect will 
the recently established liberal divorce laws in Norway and 
Sweden have upon the sex conduct of individuals ?* 
On the individual side questions constantly arise. If A’s 
wife, who is constantly ill, should suddenly die, would he be- 
come disorganized? What would be the effect of sudden wealth 
upon B? A man is doing his job poorly; what would be the 
effect on his conduct if we gave him a severe raking over the 
coals? Would he improve his work, or would it suffer still more? 
Thousands of questions of this practical kind are up before 
not only psychologists, but also up before the man on the street. 
Human life goes on. Some kind of prediction has to be made 
as to what the result of a certain situation will be. But until 
psychology becomes a science and has amassed data on behavior 
resulting from situations experimentally set up, prediction of 
behavior resulting from daily life situations will have to be 
of the hit or miss kind that it has been since the race of 
man began. i 
Control of Human Behavior—Every scientist feels that 
he makes progress in his field just to the extent to which he can 
gain control over the material with which he works—as 
examples: the harnessing of the tide, protection from lightning 
by lightning rods, the experimental production of lightning and 
rain, dissipation of fog. 
The psychologist likewise, having chosen human behavior as 
his material, feels that he makes progress only as he can manip- 
ulate or control it. Has this individual within his repertoire of 
acts gained through general schooling the possibility of being 
  
* When far-reaching social situations are set up, is an expert in 
human behavior called in? No city or corporation would build a dam 
across a sizeable stream now without consulting experts on agriculture, 
forestry, etc., to predict what the probable effect would be upon the soil 
and vegetation of the country above the dam. But here loss of money 
can be avoided, lawsuits can be saved. If social blunders are made only 
an sacrifice and unhappiness are involved, 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
8 PSYCHOLOGY 
developed into an artist, a singer, a business executive? Could 
a wonderful golf player be made of this man? If so, what 
steps should we take, what technique should we employ to 
establish the necessary habits rapidly and so that they will 
endure permanently ? 
Again we find him filled with fears, unduly shy, bashful, 
stammering. Can we change this behavior? If so, what tech- 
nique shall we follow? On the other hand, could we put a 
wholesome fear in this child that plays with snakes, hugs every 
dog he sees and picks up every strange cat? 
In this work there is involved not only ability to predict 
situation from response, and probable response given the situa- 
tion, but the experimental manipulation of stimulus and the 
creation of response—stimuli must be added to or subtracted 
from until appropriate response is attained and, if the desired 
or expected response is not in the repertoire of the individual, 
it must be established if there is raw material of a kind to 
utilize for building it. 
Here, then,.we find a true and legitimate field for experi- 
mental study of our human material. It must be experimental 
and we must some time have laboratories. Until we know more 
about the control of behavior during the tender years of infancy, 
it seems almost a dangerous experiment to bring up a child. 
The old argument that a good many millions of children have 
been successfully reared in the past few millions of years has 
just about broken down in the light of the now generally 
recognized lack of success of most people in making satisfactory 
adjustments to society. 
_—~ The behaviorist believes that only systematic, long-sustained;. 
genetic studies upon the human species begun in infancy and 
continued until past adolescence, will ever give us this experi- 
mental control over human conduct so badly needed both for 
general social control and growth and for individual happi+ 
ness. In our genetic studies on infants in chapters VI and VII, 
both the need for this work and its possibilities will be 
more apparent. 
This brief summary of the more general phases of psycholog 
should convince us of two things: First, that every hw 4 
individual needs the data and laws of behaviorism for org’

  ing his own daily life and conduct. Secondly, that since society 
acting as it has in the past purely upon the basis of medizval 
tradition, or at best only on a blundering trial-and-error basis, 
has made such slow progress in understanding and controlling 
the phenomena of human behavior, human behavior should be 
made the object: of intense scientific study. 
To point out to what extent methods now exist for a 
thoroughgoing scientific objective study of human behavior will 
be the principal objective in this volume. 
ScrentTIFIC PROCEDURE. 
The Detailed Subject Matter of Scientific Psychology.— 
As a science phychology puts'before herself the task of unraveling 
the complex factors involved in the development of human behay- 
ior from infancy to old age, and of finding the laws for the regu- 
lation of behavior.’ To solve such problems we must necessarily 
study the simple and complex things which call out action in 
man; how early in life he can react to the various simple and 
complex sense stimuli; at what age he usually puts on the various 
instinets, and what the situations are which call them out. Just 
what is the pattern of his instinctive acts—that is, does the 
human being, apart from training, do any complex acts instinc- 
tively as do the lower animals? If so, what is man’s full equip- 
ment of instincts? When does emotional activity manifest itself? 
and what are the situations which call it out? and what special 
acts can be observed in emotional behavior? How soon can we 
observe the beginnings of habits in infants? What. special 
methods can we develop for rapidly and securely implanting and 
retaining the body and speech habits which society demands? 
Stimulus and Response.—This general description of the 
subject matter of psychology helps us very little as regards 
the analysis of particular problems in conduct and behavior. 
In order to plan an experimental attack upon any problem 
in psychology we must first reduce it to its simplest terms. 
If we look over the list of problems in human behavior given 
in the preceding paragraph, and at our practical examples, 
we shall see that there are common factors running through all 
forms of human acts. In each adjustment there is always both a 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
10 PSYCHOLOGY 
  response or act and a stimulus or situation which calls out that 
response. Without going too far beyond our facts, it seems pos- 
sible to say that the stimulus is always provided by the environ- 
ment, external to the body, or by the movements of man’s own 
muscles and the secretions of his glands; finally, that the responses 
always follow relatively immediately upon the presentation or 
incidence of the stimulus. These are really assumptions, but 
they seem to be basal ones for psychology. Before we finally 
accept or reject them we shall have to examine into both the 
nature of the stimulus or situation, and of the response. If we 
provisionally accept them we may say that the goal of psycho- 
logical study is the ascertaining of such data and laws that, given 
the stimulus, psychology can predict what the response will be; 
or, on the other hand, given the response, it can specify the nature 
of the effective stimulus. 
Use of the Term Stimulus.—We use the term stimulus in 
psychology as it is used in physiology. Only in psychology we 
have to extend somewhat the usage of the term. In the psycho- 
logical laboratory, when we are dealing with relatively simple 
factors, such as the effect of ether waves of different lengths, the 
effect of sound waves, etc., and are attempting to isolate their 
effects upon: the adjustments of men, we speak of stimuli. On 
the other hand, when the factors leading to reactions are more 
complex, as, for example, in the social world, we speak of situa- 
tions. A situation is, of course, upon final analysis, resolvable 
into a complex group of stimuli. As examples of stimuli we may- 
name such things as rays of light of different wave lengths; sound 
waves differing in amplitude, length, phase, and combination; 
gaseous particles given off in such small diameters that they 
affect the membrane of the nose; solutions which contain par- 
ticles of matter of such size that the taste buds are thrown into 
action; solid objects which affect the skin and mucous mem- 
brane; radiant stimuli which call out temperature response; 
noxious stimuli, such as cutting, pricking, and those injuring 
tissue generally. Finally, movements of the muscles and activ- 
ity in the glands themselves serve as stimuli by acting upon the 
afferent nerve endings in the moving muscles.

“Ss, oat be Aba here that only under ne rarest experi- 
mental conditions can we stimulate the organism with a single 
stimulus. Jife presents stimuli in confusing combinations. As 
you write you are stimulated by a complex system—perspiration 
pours from your brow, the pen has a tendency to slip from your 
grasp; the words you write are focussed upon your retine; the 
chair offers stimulation, and finally the noises from the street 
constantly impinge upon your ear-drum. But far more impor- 
tant, delicate instruments would show that, though you are not 
speaking aloud, your vocal mechanisms—tongue, throat and 
laryngeal muscles—are in constant motion, moving in habitual 
trains; these laryngeal and throat movements serve largely as the 
stimuli for releasing the writing movements of the hands. The 
fact that you are here in the lecture room, facing your instructor 
and surrounded by your classmates, is another very important 
element. The world of stimulation is thus seen to be exceedingly 
complex. It is convenient to speak of a total mass of stimulating 
factors, which lead man to react as a whole, as a situation. Situ- 
ations can be of the simplest kind or of the greatest complexity. 
It should be noted here, finally, that there are many forms of 
physical energy which do not directly affect. our sense organs. 
As examples we may cite the facts that ether waves longer than 
760yp or shorter than 397yp do not lead to visual reactions, and 
that many of the wave motions in the air are of such length or 
amplitude that they do not produce auditory’ stimulation. The 
inability of the human organism to respond to many possible 
forms of stimulation will be discussed later. 
The General Nature of Response—lIn a similar way we 
employ in psychology the physiological term ‘‘response,’’ but 
again we must slightly extend its use. The movements which result 
from a tap on the patellar tendon, or from stroking the soles of 
the feet are ‘‘simple’’ responses which are studied both in physi- 
ology and in medicine. In psychology our study, too, is some- 
times voncerned with simple responses of these types, but more 
often with several complex responses taking place simultaneously. 
In the latter case we sometimes use the popular term ‘‘act’’ or 
adjustment, meaning by that that the whole group of responses OF

is integrated in such a way (instinct or habit) that the individual 
does something which we have a name for, that is, ‘‘takee food,’”’ 
‘builds a house,’’ ‘‘swims,’’ ‘‘writes a letter,’’ ‘‘talks.’’?? Psy- 
chology is not concerned with the goodness or badness of acts, 
or with their suecessfulness, as judged by occupational or moral 
standards. Because a man fails by his separate acts to get his 
food, to build his house, to work out his mathematical problem, 
or to live in harmony with his wife, is no reason for rejecting him 
as a psychological subject. We study him for his reaction possi- 
bilities and without prejudice; the discovery of the fact that he 
will make only abortive attempts to meet and control certain 
aspects of his environment is an important part of our task; just 
as important as being able to state that he can make certain other 
types of adjustment. ‘‘Successful’’ adjustments, ‘‘good’’ acts, 
“‘had’” acts, are terms really which society uses. Every social 
age sets up certain standards of action, but these standards 
change from cultural epoch to cultural epoch. Hence they are 
not psychological standards. Reaction possibilities, however, on 
the average probably remain about the same from eon to eon. It 
lies well within the bounds of probability that if we were able to 
obtain a new-born baby belonging to the dynasty of the Pharaohs, 
and were to bring him up along with other lads in Boston, he 
would develop into the same kind of college youth that we find 
among the other Harvard students. His chances for success in 
life would probably not be at all different from those of his 
classmates. The results obtained from the scientific analysis of 
reaction in the human being should fit any cultural age. It is 
part of the function of the psychologist to tell whether a given 
individual has the reaction possibilities within him to meet the 
standards of that cultural age, and the most rapid way of bring-, 
‘ng him to act in accordance with them. The fact that social

stimulation is a response or adjustment—blushing, inereased heart-beat, 
change in respiration, ete., are definite part adjustments, We have 
names for only a few thousand of the total possible number of such adjust- 
ments. The term adjustment is used by most writers to wefer to the 
doing of one of these named acts. In this volume the terras adjustment, 
response, and reaction are used almost interchangeably.

values (group mores) change puts ever new burdens upon the 
psychologist, because every change in the mores means a differ- 
ent situation, to which man has to respond by a differ- 
ent combination of acts, and any new set of acts must be incor- 
porated into and integrated with the rest of the action systems 
of the individual. The problems put up to psychology are those 
of deciding whether the individual can meet the new standards, 
and for determining and developing methods of instructing him. 
Motor and Glandular Indicators of Response.—What is it that 
the psychologist can observe? Behavior, of course. But behavior 
on analysis is the separate systems of reactions that the individual 
makes to his environment. When we come to study the mechanics 
of such adjustments we find that they depend upon the integra- 
tion of reflexes connecting the receptors with the muscles and 
glands. It should be emphasized here that objective psychology 
does not analyze such integrations to the bitter end except where 
the problem demands it. Concrete, whole activities are as impor- 
tant to the behaviorist as to other psychologists (see page 40). 
The unicellular organisms have no separate muscular or 
nervous systems. Yet a part of their one cell must be specialized 
in a motor as well as in a sensory way, since these organisms do 
move in response to stimuli—to light, gravity, heat, cold, elec- 
tricity, ete. As one passes higher in the animal scale one finds 
that special sense-organ tissues (receptors) develop, and along 
with them both motor or effective organs, and neurones connect- 
ing receptors and effectors. Action in such cases becomes sharper, 
more localized, more immediate, and at the same time more 
sustained. Furthermore, as we pass still further up the scale, 
glands begin to develop. Glands, like muscles, are responsive 
organs, and special glandular action takes place whenever motor 
action takes place. The activity of the glands.in turn reacts 
upon the muscular system and affects its functioning (p. 218). 
Furthermore, there are two kinds of muscles, striped and 
unstriped.» The striped muscles move the arms, legs, trunk, 
tongue and larynx. The unstriped muscles control largely the 
blood-vessels, intestines, the organs of elimination and sex. 
Usually when we speak of response we mean that the organism
-P-A-G-E-28
14 ; PSYCHOLOGY 
  goes forward to right or left, or retracts as a whole, that it eats, 
drinks, fights, builds houses, or engages in trade. But these 
patent and easily observable changes do not exhaust the term 
response, as we pointed out on page 12. We should mean by 
response the total striped and unstriped muscular and glandular 
changes which follow upon a given stimulus. Our problem of 
the moment determines which movement shall be studied in rela- 
tive isolation; in man, though, interest has been largely centered 
in the integration of separate responses; in getting him to form 
some habit—that is, to do something with arms or legs or vocal 
cords. It is important to get at the outset a comprehensive notion 
of response. A man or animal may stand stock still under stimu- 
lation, but we should not say that there was no response. Close 
observation shows that there are changes in the tension of the 
muscles, in respiration, in circulation, and in secretion. 
The General Classification of Responses.—The various pos- 
sibilities of reaction are thus seen to be vast; so vast, indeed, that 
it would seem at first sight as though any classification would be 
impossible. We can at least find a convenient grouping which 
will serve both for discussion and for setting experimental prob- 
lems. Most reactions may be looked upon as falling into one of 
four main classes: \ 
1. Explicit habit responses: as examples we cite unlocking a 
door, tennis playing, violin playing, building houses, talking 
easily to people, staying on good terms with the members of your 
own and the opposite sex. 
2. Implicit habit responses: ‘‘thinking,’’? by which we mean 
subvocal talking, general body language habits, bodily sets’ or 
attitudes which are not easily observable without instrumentation 
or experimental aid; the system of conditioned reflexes in the 
various glands and unstriped muscular mechanisms—for example, 
conditioned salivary reflexes. 
3. Explicit hereditary responses: including man’s observable 
instinctive and emotional reactioris as seen, for example, in grasp- 
ing, sneezing, blinking and dodging, and in fear, rage, love. 
4. Implicit hereditary responses: this includes, of course, the 
whole system of endocrine or ductless gland secretions (p. 181), |

changes in circulation, etc., so largely studied by physiology. 
Here again instrumentation or experimental aid is necessary 
before observation can be made. 
These various types of response will be studied in detail in 
later chapters. The classification as a whole should be clear, with 
the possible exception of 2 (implicit habit responses). This 
group is so important and so generally neglected in discussion 
that we shall single it out here for brief mention in advance of 
the chapter in which it is entered into with some care. 
What Man is Doing When Not Overtly Acting.—With a 
highly specialized organism like man, even careful observation 
often fails to show any overt response. A man may sit motion- 
less at his desk with pen in hand and paper before him. In 
popular parlance we may say he is idle or ‘‘thinking,’’ but our 
assumption is that his muscles are really as active and possibly 
more active than if he were playing tennis. But what muscles? 
Those muscles which have been trained to act when he is in such 
a situation, his laryngeal, tongue, and speech muscles generally.* 
Those muscles are as active and are carrying out as orderly a 
system of movements as if he were executing a sonata on the 
piano; they are doing it well or ill, depending upon the training 
he has had along the particular lines which engage him. While 
we cannot at present watch the play of this implicit stream of 
words, there is no reason for hypothecating a mystery about 
it. Could we bring ‘‘thinking’’ out for observation as readily 
as we can tennis playing or rowing, the need of ‘‘explaining’’ it 
would disappear. We shall see later that efforts have been made 
to bring such responses under experimental control. But entirely 
apart from our present unreadiness to make observation on 
implicit habits, we find a certain way of arriving indirectly at 
the same end: implicit language habits, by methods which we 
shall study, come to issue finally in overt action. By watching 
the easily observable explicit habits and instincts of an individual 
keenly enough, and for a sufficient stretch of time, and under 
varying enough conditions, we can obtain the necessary data for 
most psychological requirements.   
* Indeed, the whole glandular apd muscular systems are contributory.

  16 PSYCHOLOGY 
Scientific Methods Contrasted with Practical Procedure.— 
Having now examined at some length into the general nature of 
both stimulus and response, we should be prepared to under- 
stand the object of a psychological experiment and to contrast 
the scientific procedure with the common-sense or practical pro- 
cedure which we discussed at the beginning of the chapter. We 
shall take up almost at random some definite illustrative psy- 
chological problems, and the methods of solving them. Our first 
problem is to find out what the reactions of a six-months-old 
infant are to living, furry animals. We first arrange the situa- 
tion (complex group of stimuli, p. 10). The infant is held by 
its mother in a well-lighted room. We observe first that the 
infant is smiling, and comfortably disposed. Then, one after 
another, we present a white rat, a dog, a cat, a white rabbit, 
beetles, and a snake. We next record accurately and separately 
the reactions to these objects. The infant, which has only learned 
to reach out for objects a short time before, slowly puts out first 
one hand and then the other. The smile leaves his face, but no 
erying or withdrawing of the hands or external secretions fol- 
lows. These are only the more easily observed responses. Other 
changes take place undoubtedly, in the internal glands, circula- 
tion, respiration, ete. It depends upon our immediate problem as 
to where the emphasis in observation shall fall in our record of 
reaction changes. In this case our problem was to determine 
whether there were any overt instinctive tendencies on the baby’s 
part to react against or withdraw the hands or whole body from 
live animals. Our problem might very well have led us into 
observing the changes in the eyes, respiration, blood-pressure, 
salivation, or in the endocrine glands, or in several of these at 
once. Again, it should be noted that our problem is not so simple 
as it seems at first sight. Suppose we had found that the baby 
did withdraw from the objects, began to ery, void urine, or 
attempt to hide behind the mother’s clothing—could we have 
concluded that there was an instinctive reaction against live 
furry animals? Not without delving into the baby’s past. If 
we had had the child under constant observation, and found no 
record of previous acquaintanceship with live animals, our

  PROBLEMS AND SCOPE OF PSYCHOLOGY 17 
answer would be that the observable responses were probably 
instinctive. But if, on the other hand, we found that the child 
had been severely bitten by a cat only two days before our test, 
our conclusions would have to wait upon more extended observa- 
tion. Nor can we, from the behavior of this one child, draw any 
conclusions as to what other children of the same age will do, 
or what this child might do at a slightly different age or when 
tested under different conditions. Before generalizations can be 
made many children should be brought under systematic 
observation. 
As another example of a somewhat more restricted type, let 
us take the case of a man whose every-day behavior has led us 
to suspect the normality of his responses to monochromatic (col- 
ored) light. Common-sense has nothing to say; it can give no 
adequate report on him. His mistakes may be due to one or many 
things. We take him into the laboratory where monochromatic 
light is under control, and we put him in situations where he has 
to react to the lights in pairs, and, where each one of the lights 
ean be widely varied in energy. In the course of the investiga- 
tion we find that when there is a certain energy relation obtaining 
between the red and the green light he can no longer react to them 
differentially (that is to say, they do not offer different stimulat- 
ing values). We note further that we can find a white light of 
a certain intensity to which he reacts as he does to either of the 
monochromatic lights. But at no energy relation between any 
other two colors can we break down his differential responses. 
We conclude after this careful study that the man is red-green 
blind, that is, that he reacts to red and green as he does to certain 
intensities of white light. Let us take another example, and 
this time from the field of vocational psychology. Suppose that 
the telephone directory of a large city is getting entirely too 
bulky and complex for men to handle easily. What is the best 
method for obviating this? The telephone people and the psy-   
‘If we find by repeated tests that the anomaly is more than temporary, 
we are right in advising this man that he will be handicapped if he enters 
certain occupations, e.g., locomotive and marine engineering, geology, adver- 
tising, ete. In othew words, the results of psychological experimentation 
are as immediately practicable as are results in any other scientific field.

chologists work together. The psychologist may suggest printing 
in smaller type and four columns to the page instead of three. 
These and many other possible suggestions may lead to a solu- 
tion of the problem. But the matter has to be put to severe trial 
both at the hands of individuals trained to look up names in a 
directory and individuals having no more training than has the 
general public. Systematic trial and error is the procedure here, 
with statistical treatment of the results. In the end it is found 
that a four-column page with a certain amount of spacing between 
the lines of print makes the directory not only 20 per cent. less 
bulky, but also one in which the subscribers can find names 10 
per cent. more rapidly (Baird). s 
Tue Divisions or PSYCHOLOGY AND THE RELATIONS OF PsycHOL- 
OGY TO THE OTHER SCIENCES. 
The Various Fields of Psychology.—It is just as difficult to 
draw a hard-and-fast line between the different branches of 
psychology as between the different branches of biology and 
of physics. Practical and theoretical interests determine where a 
man will throw the emphasis of his observation. All scientific 
psychology is experimental, or is at least carried out under such 
conditions that rigid and controlled observation is possible. All 
psychology is ‘‘genetic’’ in the sense that we have to go back to 
the child and contrast it with animals in order to determine what 
native systems of integrations belong peculiarly to man. For 
purposes of specialization we speak of human psychology as being 
made up of individual, vocational, child, folk, educational, legal, 
pathological and social psychology. We may speak of any of 
these special branches as being ‘‘applied.’’ For our purposes 
we need not enter into a separate characterization of these special 
branches. The remaining chapters in this book attempt to deal 
generally with the simpler results, problems, and methods in 
common use in psychology. We shall not emphasize, except here 
and there, the particular branch to which such material belongs. 
Relation of Psychology to Physics.—Both physiology and 
psychology are dependent (as is every other science at bottom) 
upon physics for the control of apparatus and of stimulus. It 
. is essential for a research student in psychology now to know the  
-P-A-G-E-33
    PROBLEMS AND SCOPE OF PSYCHOLOGY 19 
general facts about wave motion; as, for example, heat, sound 
and light. It is important to know how to install and use 
simple electrical instruments, galvanometers, thermal couples, 
and photometers. 
Relation to Neurology.—It might be supposed that psy- 
chology would lean most heavily upon neurology. Indeed, this 
has been the general assumption in the past. Gradually we are 
coming to the point of view that psychology is more dependent 
upon such subjects as physiology and certain branches of medi- 
cine such as hygiene, endocrinology, the chemistry of metabolism, 
pediatrics and psychiatry, than upon neural anatomy. In the 
past we have been too content with making brain pictures and 
mechanical neural schema to always look carefully enough at our 
behavior facts. We need in psychology all of the available 
facts that the neurologists can give us, but we can very well 
leave out of consideration those ingenious puzzle pictures that 
compare the action of the central nervous system with a series of 
pipes and valves, sponges, electric ‘switchboards, and the like. 
Some notion of the elementary guiding principles in neurology is 
certainly essential to the beginner in psychology, such as the way 
sense organs are connected with the central nervous system, and 
the central nervous system with the muscular and glandular sys- 
tems. In Chapter IV we touch upon some of the more elementary 
features connected with the arrangement and functioning of 
reflex pathways. 
Relation of Psychology to Physiology.—It has been claimed 
by some that behavior psychology is really physiology. That 
this is not the case appears from even a casual examination of 
the respective scopes of the two provinces. Physiology teaches 
us concerning the functions of the special organs. For pur- 
poses of experimentation and exposition, the heart, liver, lungs, 
circulation, respiration, and other organs are isolated, and they 
are discussed as though they functioned in an isolated way. 
Muscle-nerve preparations are taken out and their properties 
investigated; glands and their action are likewise experimented 
upon. All of the functions of the bodily organs are gone over 
from this standpoint. It is not meant to assume that physiolo- 
gists deal wholly with organs in isolation. Certain combined
-P-A-G-E-34
20 PSYCHOLOGY 
processes are studied, such as metabolism, digestion, effects of 
poisons, etc., but nowhere in physiology do we get the organism, 
as it were, put back together again and tested in relation to its 
environment as a whole. 
From our discussion of the scope of psychology we are now 
prepared to see that when the physiologist has learned all that 
he can about the functioning of the separate organs of the body 
of man, he has encroached upon our field only in a very slight 
degree. Our task begins only when the physiologist puts the 
separate organs together again, and turns the whole (man) over 
to us. The physiologist qua physiologist knows nothing of the 
total situations in the daily life of an individual that shape his 
action and conduct. He may teach us all there is to know about 
the mechanism of stepping, but it is not his task to determine 
whether man walks before he crawls, the age at which walking 
begins, whether walking begins earlier in boys than in girls, or 
whether defective children walk at a later age than normal 
children. Again, he may teach us a great deal about the func- 
tions of the kidneys, the bladder, and of the sphincter control 
of the latter; but of the special situations (outside of disease 
entities) which may lead to incontinence in children, his science 
teaches him nothing, nor of methods of controlling this mal- 
adjustment. In studying psychological functions—for example, 
the emotions—it does not help us very much to try to picture 
what chemical and neural processes go on in the brain. We get 
a very incomplete but a somewhat better view if we consider 
what glandular action goes on during emotional states. But 
even glandular action is not easily observed by methods which 
are known to-day. We can, however, study the reaction states 
we popularly call sadness, elation, moroseness, rage, fear and 
love, from the standpoint of what the organism can do in these 
states, and whether the smooth running of the general system of 
organized habits is facilitated or disturbed by the presence of 
emotional activity. We can, further, often determine by a study 
of the life history of the individual how frequently such dis- 
turbances come about, and can trace out the causes or factors 
leading to their onset. Physiology has nothing to tell us of the 
character and personality of different individuals nor of their 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
PROBLEMS AND SCOPE OF PSYCHOLOGY 21 
emotional stability or lack of emotional control, nor as to what 
extent their present place in life is dependent upon their up- 
bringing. Physiology tells us nothing of man’s capacity to 
form and retain habits, nor of the complexity of man’s habit 
organization. Hence, if we wish to predict whether an individual 
is capable of meeting or rising above the environment to which 
he is at present but poorly adjusted, we should have to go to 
psychology and not to physiology for our answer. In thus 
emphasizing the entire theoretical independence of the two fields, 
let us not set up a false impression of antagonism. Physiology 
is psychology’s closest friend among the biological sciences. We 
ean hardly move a step in psychology without using physiological 
data. But in this we are not different from the other biological 
sciences, or indeed from medicine itself. 
Overlapping of the Two Fields.—Occasionally we find physi- 
ologists who have dealt with functions which overlap the field 
of human behavior. As examples, we cite the work of Cannon 
on the bodily _effect_of violent emotional disturbances, and of 
Carlson and others on the question of the reactions which are 
present in the stomach in the absence of food. Where the two 
fields overlap most, however, is probably in the study of the con- 
ditioned motor secretion reflexes and in the realm of sensory 
physiology. This latter topic seems no longer to seriously interest 
the physiologists, and where they have shown interest in it— 
in this country at least—it has been mainly pedagogical.- Most 
of the work in sensory physiology has been done by psy- 
chologists. Until the recent work of Pavlow and Bechterew and 
their students, physiologists have shown little interest in the 
study of habit formation, which general topic is one of our cen- 
tral ones. In general it may be said that there is some over- 
lapping in the two fields, but that it does not keep them from 
being separate disciplines. In. cases where there is an overlap- 
ping, the methods and points of view of the two sciences in no 
wise differ. 
Relation of Psychology to Medicine——Up to the present 
time psychology has been of only slight service to psychiatry and 
medicine generally. It should form a background for the whole 
field of medicine. But it has dealt hitherto so largely with specu-
-P-A-G-E-36
22 PSYCHOLOGY 
lations and with philosophical considerations that its usefulness 
for this purpose has been seriously restricted. 
The physician, whether medical specialist or general prac- 
titioner, would like to know something about the method of 
approaching and handling his patients. He must encounter— 
and he must be prepared to encounter—such things as stubborn- 
ness and unyieldingness in his human subjects, and he must 
learn to study his patients in relation to their present environ- 
ment, and to go back into their life history for an understand- 
ing and explanation of such attitudes. He must learn how to 
size up his patients, and to get at the details of their individu- 
ality and characteristics. He must be able to tell whether the 
patient can do what he is told to do, and whether he has suf- 
ficient assets to meet the environment in which he has to live, and 
whether he has sufficient assets to rise out of the environment 
which is unsuited to him. These facts on character adaptation 
cannot be expressed in any other terms than behavior terms. 
There are, to be sure, factors which concern every one who has 
to deal with his fellow-man, but on account of the intimate rela- 
tionship existing between the patient and his physician they are 
of especial importance to the latter. The psychiatrist has not 
neglected these factors; indeed, it has been due to him that they 
have been emphasized at all, and it is largely through his efforts 
that we have a well-developed and systematic technic for isolating 
the factors of importance in the life history of the patient. So 
far as psychiatry is concerned, I think we can say that the psy- 
chology the psychiatrist uses is not different from the psychology 
we are trying to study. The psychiatrist has to be both a physi- 
cian, with a specially developed therapeutic technic, and a psy- 
chologist with special interests in certain divisions of psychology. 
Psychiatry has no special need for detailed studies on reactions 
to sensory stimuli. Much of the detailed work on habit forma- 
tion and on the separate analysis of instincts is not of special 
use to him. On the other hand, any of the material which the 
psychologist may offer on the subjects of attachment and detach- 
ment of the emotions, on the genesis of instincts and habits and 
their inter-relations, on the effect of age, drugs, etc., on habit

formation and retention, upon false reactions and failures in 
reactions, on the effect of lesions of the central nervous systems 
in trained animals, and the resultant success that comes from 
retraining them, can be utilized by the psychiatrist at once, both 
in a specific way and by reason of its value in helping him to 
size up his patients. Most psychiatrists will admit that when 
the proper kind of psychology is developed they can utilize di- 
rectly a large part of both its methods and its materials. This 
appears clearly when we examine the various tests which have 
been devised by psychologists for evaluating the general behavior 
levels of individuals. Such tests in one or another form are in 
common use in every psychiatric clinic. Topics such as ‘‘general 
behavior,’’ ‘‘stream of talk,’’ *‘attitude,’’ ‘‘orientation,’’ ‘‘reten- 
tion’’ of recent and past happenings, ‘‘ general information,’’ the 
emotional level at which acts are carried out, are discussed in 
relation to every patient admitted to a psychiatric clinic. 
Preparation for Psychology.—In dealing with the native 
equipment of man, the student will find a background of study 
of animal behavior a helpful one. As a further preparation for 
this part of his work, he will find that he needs some equipment 
in physiology and experimental zodlogy. His work in habit 
formation leads him again into physiology and pharmacology for 
such factors as the effect of age, drugs, chemicals and glandular 
extracts upon the human organism. The consideration of habit 
and instinct conflicts, abortive reactions and failures of adjust- 
ment generally which we see so much emphasized in ties, sympa- 
- thetic chorea, hysteria, obsessions, etc., leads the psychologist into 
the psychiatric clinic if he wishes to prepare himself to the full- 
est extent. Business and law are making ever and ever larger 
demands upon him. Some familiarity with legal and business 
problems is almost essential. Finally, in order to handle ade- 
quately experimental data some training in the use of statistical 
methods is needed. If a start is made early enough by the student 
who is preparing for psychology, he can obtain training in the 
above related branches before he begins his special study of 
psychology. While to-day is a day of specialists, it should not 
be a day of narrow specialists.

CHAPTER II 
  PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS 
Introduction.—In the preceding chapter we referred several 
times to psychological methods and procedure. It remains to 
give a somewhat more extended discussion of objective methods 
as employed in human psychology. In the end we will find that 
this preliminary survey of methods will assist us in understand- 
ing the results which have been obtained in the field of psy- 
chology.t Psychological methods in detail are very numerous. 
When we come to look them over, however, we find that most of 
them fall within the following general classification : 
I, Observation, with and without instrumental control. 
II. The conditioned reflex methods. 
(a) Methods employed in obtaining conditioned secretion 
reflexes. 
(b) Methods employed in obtaining conditioned motor 
reflexes. 
III. The verbal report method. 
IV. Methods of testing. 
These various methods are not completely independent, but 
the reasons for such a classification will appear after a careful con- 
sideration of the text. 
  
*The Instructor is advised at this point to give at least two demon- 
stration lectures on the simple forms of apparatus employed in psychology, 
and upon the method of treating the results. We suggest some demonstra- 
tion of the expressive methods, showing how respiration, vasomotor changes, 
can be recorded and timed; upon the way of administering the word- 
association test, both with a simple stop-watch and with better timing 
devices; of the method of recording and timing eye movements by pho- 
tography as the eye moves in reading, ete. The student should be put 
through some test such as the Trabue language test, the army alpha test, 
the range of information test, ete. If time permits, the apparatus and 
methods used in the study of “memory” and the conditioned reflex should be 
given, Some familiarity with sense organ experimentation is also advised.

PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS 25 
I. OpseRVATION WiTH AND WirHouT INSTRUMENTAL CONTROL. 
Unaided Observation.—Observation, as the man on the 
street uses the term, is, of course, the oldest method known to 
science. We make our observations in all natural sciences by 
the aid of our sense organs. In one sense instrumentation may 
be looked upon merely as a device for increasing the number of 
observations which can be made simultaneously. In a normal 
individual, vision is the sense most usually employed. When 
this sense is denied us, or will not work in a particular problem, 
we depend for observation upon the auditory and tactual sense 
organs. Under ordinary conditions, smell and taste are not used 
as organs of scientific observation. At times, however, their 
use is indispensable in chemistry, medicine, ete. Our muscular 
sense enables us principally to make observations concerning the 
movements and positions of our own bodies, serving at the same 
time crudely the purpose of enabling us to react differentially 
to the size, weight, and position of objects other than parts of 
our own bodies. 
Practically all of the results which have been obtained in the 
psychology of common-sense have come through the use of un- 
aided observation. By such observation we obtain gross changes 
in the activities of the individual or the crowd, the general 
behavior of children and animals, and certain aspects of emo- 
tional and instinctive activity. We must not confuse the ob- 
servation made by a scientist without instrumental control with 
the amateurish and muddled observation made by the untrained 
individual. Some of the finest work we have in biology has been 
done by scientists without instrumental control. We cite the 
behavior work of Fabre, Wheeler, and the Peckhams. Unaided 
observation, however, even when employed by the trained man, 
becomes a genuine scientifie method only when he puts his results 
down and begins to note exceptions, to draw tentative conclusions, 
and then to gather new observations to check up such conclusions. 
In other words, such data must be subjected to statistical methods 
before conclusions can be verified. We brought out in the last 
chapter that even without the use of instruments we may learn 
something about the stimuli which produce responses in human 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
26 PSYCHOLOGY 
beings, and something about the nature of the acts themselves. 
‘Without instrumentation, however, many of the phenomena of 
conduct cannot be brought under adequate scientific control. 
At best the unaided method in our field is only a rough and 
ready one that enables us to proceed in a provisional way. We 
may illustrate this by the following example: A person comes 
into the room; we speak to him in an ordinary conversational 
tone. He does not respond to our words. We immediately infer 
that the individual has defective hearing. But from such rough 
observation, even after watching him for several days, we get 
little indication of the extent of the defect, and of the types of 
limitations to which he is subject. Again, in the sphere of learn- 
ing we may note that a given individual fails to learn quickly, 
and does not retain his training for any length of time. If we 
wish to get an accurate picture of his defects, one accurate 
enough to compare with that obtained from another individual, 
systematic observation with instrumental control has to be 
employed. 
‘Observation with the Aid of Instrumentation, and Control 
of the Subject—Progress in any science can be measured by the 
extent to which apparatus and improved methods of observation 
have been employed. This has been well illustrated in the tech- 
nical world, and especially in physics, chemistry and engineering. 
Psychology likewise early felt the necessity of devising special 
instruments for the study of behavior. These methods are clearly 
illustrated both in the field of sensory physiology and in that 
of the more complicated reactions. In general we may say that 
whatever phenomenon is open to unaided observation can be more 
accurately studied where instrumentation and control of the sub- 
ject are employed. If we are testing the rapidity with which an 
individual can repeat the separate members of a list of common 
words, we must have some kind of measure of the process. Un- 
aided observation is all but worthless. An ordinary watch gives 
only a rough indication. A 1+/,-second stop-watch gives an ap- 
proach towards a scientific instrument; a standard chronoscope, 
indicating */,,, of a second, gives a scientific record which at 
present is probably a finer measure than we need in psychology.
-P-A-G-E-41
PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS 27 
The extent to which instrumentation is being employed is clearly 
recognized in the various devices for photographing and timing 
eye movements, in the devices for measuring the speed and accu- 
racy of hand and finger movements, as in tapping, steadiness and 
strength of grip. The need of accurate apparatus is clearly 
recognized in the technic used in determining sensory responses, 
and in the various psychophysical measurements. Instrumenta- 
tion is just being introduced into the measuring and timing of 
secretion responses—for example, in the salivary, sweat and indi- 
rectly in the endocrine glands (glandular secretions are discussed 
on page 181). Certain divisions of psychology have all but resisted 
the use of instrumentation. There have been few experimental 
studies upon emotional reactions (page 198), few upon interral 
muscular reactions, and, until recently, few upon the internal 
responses connected with hunger, thirst, and the temperature 
responses to stimulation of the alimentary tract. Few, if any, 
experiments have sueceeded in bringing the sub-vocal mechan- 
isms under control. Indeed, many of the glandular responses 
have, from a psychological standpoint, not been touched—for 
example, the possible conditioned reflexes which we may find in 
the thyroid, adrenal, and sex glands, and in the secretions of the 
kidneys. At present there is no way of using instrumentation 
where the individual or group has to be observed for long periods 
of time, as, for example, in sleep, reaction of crowds to emotion- 
producing stimuli, and the influence of children upon each other. 
The Setting of an Experiment.—In general, in most psycho- 
logical investigations of the laboratory type, where accuracy and 
control in observation are demanded, the experimenter makes his 
observations upon one, or, at best, a few subjects. In addition 
to the instruments necessary to make observations, we must 
control certain aspects of the subject’s environment—depending 
upon the nature of the experiment, we place him in a dark room, 
or in a well-lighted room; we leave him in the room alone, or make 
him react before other people. Indeed, it is often necessary to 
control his diet, sleep, and living conditions, as is illustrated by 
the experiments which have been carried out upon hunger, thirst. 
and salivary secretions, the effect upon general behavior of fast-

  28 PSYCHOLOGY 
ing and drugs. We may look upon such controls as the experi- 
mental setting for an observation. In short, we may say that in 
order to make accurate psychological observations, we need in- 
struments delicate enough to suit the general purpose of the 
investigation. Furthermore, we need to be able to control and 
modify at will the temporary or permanent environment of the 
subject. Naturally there are many psychological investigations 
which cannot be conducted in this way. Certain important psy- 
chological undertakings probably can never be brought under 
laboratory control. Reference here, of course, is made to the 
social problems which psychology sometimes has to study. A 
youth, for example, is not making good in his school environment : 
we take him into the laboratory and study his character and tem- 
perament as best we can, run him through all the necessary tests, 
size him up, and then we advise certain changes which the parents 
and teachers should make in his environment. Time must be 
given for these recommended changes to have their effect. Dr. 
Adolf Meyer often speaks of his psychopathic patients as experi- 
ments of nature. There are many problems of this character 
in psychology that yield only little at the hands of a laboratory 
man. Much of the work now being done in the field of vocational 
psychology and in educational training is of this type. In such 
broad psychological problems the environment is not under the 
immediate control of the observer. In such cases we do the best 
we can, calling in all the observational, experimental, and statis- 
tical aids we can summon. 
II. Tae Conpirionep Rertex Merxops. 
Introduction.—In the various conditioned reflex methods we 
have a special example of the way instruments are employed in 
the: making of psychological observation. By means of these 
methods many phenomena of reaction can be brought under con- 
trol which cannot be observed by the verbal report methods to 
be described later. It is impossible for us to state by unaided 
observation whether action im the salivary glands is accelerated 
or the reverse by the sight of certain kinds of food. These reflex 
methods have been in common use in the Russian laboratories
-P-A-G-E-43
  
  PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS 29 
for a number of years. The data obtained by such methods are 
not entirely new, but the technic of the methods had not been 
well established until the work of Pavlow and Bechterew appeared. 
The methods can be employed both upon the muscles and upon 
the glands. In general they depend upon the following fact: 
Every fundamental reflex in the body has an appropriate stimulus 
for the calling out of that reflex. On page 233 we discuss some 
of the fundamental reflexes. We may anticipate somewhat and 
mention a few of them here. If the patellar tendon is touched 
with a small percussion hammer, the familiar kick of the leg 
appears. If the sole of the foot, or the great toe, is stimulated 
by an electric current, the foot will jerk back, or the toe will rise. 
If the finger is pricked or burned, the finger will draw back. 
In a similar way, if the mouth is stimulated by food, and espe- 
cially by an acid, the salivary glands will begin to pour out 
their secretions more rapidly. Let us call the stimuli that pro- 
duce native or fundamental reflexes, the normal or adequate 
stimuli to the reflexes. The question before us is whether we 
ean get any other stimulus to touch off such a fundamental or 
native reflex—whether we can get a transfer or substitution of 
stimulus. Without entering too much into the details of the 
method, we find that it is possible to get a stimulus which does not 
ordinarily call out one of the fundamental reflexes to call it out, 
provided the proper conditions are observed. It is a real question 
whether we should call these methods conditioned reflex methods, 
or substituted stimulus methods. The term ‘‘conditioned reflex’”’ 
seems to be fairly well incorporated in the literature, and it is 
probably best for us to use that term. In the following para- 
graphs we shall illustrate this method by taking some simple 
laboratory situations.

Conditioned Salivary Reflex.—The conditioned salivary re- 
flex has been made popular through the work of Pavlow and his 
students upon the dog. Not until very recently was it possible 
for us to use this method upon man, since an operation was neces-

sary to bring the gland to the surface of the cheek. Recently 
Lashley, of the Hopkins laboratory, has used the simple instru- 
ment shown below for making the responses of this gland plainly 
visible to the eye (Fig. 1). The parotid glands (page 176) of 
the two cheeks are easiest to work with, although the submaxil- 
lary gland can be used. Each parotid gland has leading out from 
it a small duct called Stenson’s duct. The instrument shown in 
Fig. 1 consists of a metal disc. 18 mm. in diameter, in which two 
concentric chambers A and B are cut. The inner one of these 
is 10 mm. in diameter and 3 mm. deep; the outer, in the form of 
a circular groove, is 2 mm. wide and 3 mm. deep. The two 
chambers open through the back of the disc into two separate 
tubes, C and D, of 2 mm. bore and 15 em. in length. The tubes 
are of silver. The instrument is placed against the inner surface

of the cheek so that the central chamber covers the mouth of 
Stenson’s duct, and the air is exhausted from the outer chamber 
by asuction pump. The dise then clings tightly to the cheek for 
as long a time as one cares to work. In a few moments the saliva 
fills the central chamber and begins to flow out through the tube 
C to a suitable measuring device. When the jaws are closed 
the tube lies between the cheek and the upper molars, and passes 
out through the corner of the mouth. The instrument interferes 
little with talking or eating, and may be worn for hours. The 
drops of saliva may be recorded in various ways. They may be 
merely counted and the average number of drops per minute 
determined, or the drops may be collected in a calibrated tube. 
We next determine in any individual subject the normal rate of 
flow at a given interval after food has been eaten. We are then 
in a position to tell whether certain forms of stimulation which
-P-A-G-E-45
  PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS 31 
we may employ increase or decrease the flow. In this way we 
may test the effect of chewing hard and soft substances, of hot 
water, cold water, ete. So far as described, the method is at the 
service both of the physiologist and of the psychologist. Indeed, 
we may look upon all such tests as purely physiological tests of 
the functioning of the glands. We find by employing this instru- 
ment the various stimulating factors which affect the gland. 
The psychological question now comes up: Is the action of the 
gland connected in any way with the individual’s habit systems? 
We find by repeated trials that the sight of unaccustomed 
objects does not have any effect upon the flow of the glands. On 
the other hand, if we bring the hungry subject into a situation 
where he has obtained food, and then show him food which he 
has been in the habit of eating (food positively reacted to), the 
glands immediately begin to function above normal. In other 
jwords, these visual stimuli which ordinarily have no effect upon 
the functioning of the glands, come by the process of substitu- 
tion to serve as stimuli for increasing the flow of secretion. This 
probably can be shown most clearly by actual experiment. After 
determining the ordinary rate of the flow of the salivary gland, 
a bar of chocolate almond was handed to the subject. He was 
allowed to smell it, to bring it to his lips, and to hold it at arm’s 
length. The following table shows the result of this experiment: 
Normal rate: about one drop per minute.

Ist minute Zs 
2nd minute ... .. 3 drops 
3rd minute . 4 drops

Brought chocolate to lips but kept mouth closed. 9 drops . 4 drops 
   
Unless this method had been employed, we would not have 
known that the mere sight and touch of food had such a stimu- 
lating effect. The subject’s own report is worthless, because the 
food might have inhibited swallowing, and his mouth would have 
filled with saliva, even though the fluid came at a normal rate. 
He probably would have told us that his mouth watered. Some 
situations as we have experimentally determined do actually in-
-P-A-G-E-46
32 PSYCHOLOGY 
hibit swallowing; then the mouth fills with fiuid, even though 
the stimulus actually produces glandular inhibition. In other 
words, it is quite clear that the presentation of the chocolate 
produced not only the overt response of reaching out for it and 
taking it towards the mouth, but at the same time produced 
implicit habit responses, which showed in the glandular reac- 
tion. It was only by means of the introduction of instru- 
mentation that we were able to bring this fact out. It is quite 
possible that all the glands of the body are subject to stimulus 
substitution. 
B. MerHops EMPLOYED IN OBTAINING CONDITIONED Motor 
REFLEXES. 
Introduction.—In a similar way, Bechterew has shown that 
reaction in both striped and smooth muscles can be conditioned. 
These conditioned motor reflexes are quite common in daily life. 
We see them often in moving-picture tragedies; as, for example, 
when the villain displays a revolver and pulls the trigger, or 
strikes the unfortunate hero over the head with a black-jack, the 
mere sight of these acts makes many in the audience jump or 
withdraw exactly as though the sound were present, or the blow 
had fallen upon their own heads. In the laboratory the technic 
of the method is quite simple. Suppose we have our subject sit 
with a bare foot resting upon two metal electrodes. When the 
faradic stimulus (slight electric shock) is given, the foot is jerked 
up from the metal electrodes. We introduce some system for 
recording upon smoked paper the jerk of the foot, and for mark- 
ing on the record the moment the stimulus is given. The elec- 
trie shock will inevitably and invariably make the foot jump. 
The ringing of an electric bell, however, has no such effect. Now, 
if we sound the bell and stimulate the foot with the high fre- 
quency current simultaneously for a certain number of times 
(20 to 70 usually), we will find that the ringing of the bell alone 
will produce the upward jerk of the foot. Here, as before, there 
has been a substitution of stimulus: a sound which does not 
ordinarily call out the reflex soon comes to do so. Probably the 
simplest way to carry out conditioned reflex experiments is to 
use the finger. In Fig. 2 we show the simple device employed.
-P-A-G-E-47
  PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS 33 
The palm of the hand is placed on one electrode, the middle 
finger upon the other, A little receiving tambour, having a cork 
saddle attached to it, is placed directly above the finger. At 
each upward fling of the finger, the tambour, attached to a 
writing lever, makes a mark upon a smoked drum. A somewhat 
more complicated recording system than is demanded in the 
present type of experiment is shown on page 36. 
As may readily be seen, the finger can be more conveniently 
used for general laboratory purposes than the foot. This technic

Fie. 2.—Method of recording finger movement and of giving faradic stimulation. A large electrode is placed under the hand, and a small electrode under the finger. When the key, in the experimenter’s room, is pressed down by the operator the secondary cur- rent from the inductorium causes the finger to rise from the small electrode. A receiving tambour, to the face of which a saddle-shaped button has been shellacked, enables a graphic record to be made of such movements. 
is now in general use, and can be used with children, with defec- 
tive individuals, as well as with normal adults. Our method for 
obtaining the reflex is somewhat as follows: In beginning work 
upon any new subject we first sound the bell alone to see if it 
will produce the reflex. We have never been able to get the 
reflex evoked by the bell alone prior to electrical stimulation. We 
next give the bell and shock simultaneously for about five trials, 
and then offer the bell alone. If the conditioned reflex does not 
appear, we next give five more stimulations with the bell and 
electric current simultaneously, and repeat this routine until the 
reflex appears. The conditioned reflex makes its appearance at 
first haltingly—that is, it will appear once and then disappear. 
Punishment is frequently resorted to. It may next appear twice 
in succession and again disappear. After a time it begins to 
appear regularly each time the bell is offered. In the best cases we 
3
-P-A-G-E-48
Cn tae Re Ee gM ae Re

34 PSYCHOLOGY | 
get a conditioned reflex after about fourteen to thirty combined 
stimulations. In attempting to use this method one must be pre- 
pared to find certain subjects who do not readily show condi- 
tioned reflexes. Just what the reasons for this are cannot readily 
be stated at present. The method is really in its infancy. 
So far we have discussed. the motor conditioned reflex as it 
appears in the striped muscles of the hands, feet, legs. The un- 
striped and mixed striped and unstriped groups show conditioned 
reflexes as well. If a technic is developed for measuring the 
width of the pupil, a bright light may be used in place of an 
electrical stimulation. The bell is sounded at the same instant 
the bright light is flashed. The light causes the pupil to contract, 
and after the bell and light have appeared enough times together, 
the bell alone will produce the contraction. The respiratory 
mechanism can be very easily and readily made to show condi- 
tioned reflexes, as can the heart-beat. 
Some General Characteristics of the Conditioned Reflex.— 
It is interesting at this point to treat of certain characteristics 
of the reflex. 
First, as regards the similarity and difference between 
the conditioned reflex and the primary reflex upon which 
it is grafted. However much they may differ so far as the cen- 
tral nervous pathway is concerned, the general and coarser 
motor features are closely similar. One watching the movements 
of a subject first beginning to show a conditioned reflex cannot 
tell whether he is being stimulated by the bell alone or by the 
bell and punishment combined. The conditioned motor reflex 
is usually sharp, quick and widespread, the whole body as a rule 
being brought into the reaction at first. Gradually the reflex 
becomes more circumscribed. 
Second, as regards persistence of the reflex; after the reflex 
has once been thoroughly established it carries over from one 
day’s experiments to the next for an indefinite period. Some- 
times a single punishment at the beginning of a day’s work is 
necessary to cause the reflex to make its appearance. We are not 
able to state over how long a period of time the unexercised reflex 
will persist. In one case we trained one subject thoroughly in 
) |
-P-A-G-E-49
  PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS 35 
May to the bell, then did not test him again until October. The 
reflex did not appear on the first ringing of the bell, but after the 
first administration of the combined stimuli (at which the subject 
disrupted the apparatus although the induction shock was very 
weak) the conditioned reflex appeared regularly to the bell alone. 
Third. We know that the conditioned motor reflex can be 
made to undergo reinforcement and inhibition by factors such 
as those described on page 171. A few examples of the réle such 
factors play in the control of the reflex may be of interest. Take 
first the ‘‘fatigue’’ of the reflex. A well-trained subject will 
react regularly for an indefinite period of time to a stimulus given 
at an interval of four to five seconds. If now we give the stim- 
ulus, that is the bell, every two seconds for a short time, he may 
react for the first three times and then fail. If the interval is 
then lengthened, or a rest period introduced, the reflex will again 
appear. It will be seen later that we utilize this principle of 
fatigue in setting up differential reactions. Oftentimes before 
the conditioned reflex is thoroughly set up, it will after a time 
begin to decrease in amplitude. Whether the time is increased is 
not known. When the reflex is beginning to vanish it can be 
strengthened in a variety of ways, the most usual way being the 
introduction of the current, but it can be reinforced also by 
introducing simultaneously with the bell some other form of 
stimulation, such as contact or temperature. 
Psychological Use of the Conditioned Reflex.—In the cases 
of the deaf and dumb, of infants and of some pathological 
subjects, language methods cannot be used. This, of course, is 
true with respect to the animal world also. Consequently we may 
say in general that the conditioned reflex method may prove of 
service wherever language cannot be depended upon (whether 
due to defect or not). In the second place, the conditioned reflex 
method may be used as a check upon the verbal report method 
to be described later. We may briefly illustrate some of the uses 
of the method as we have so far described it. Suppose we wish 
to determine the limits of spectral sensitivity in man, that is, 
how far out into the red and into the violet he can still react 
visually to ether waves. We start with any intermediate wave  
-P-A-G-E-50
36 PSYCHOLOGY 7 
length and by use of the electric shock establish a conditioned 
reflex. Each time the light appears the reflex occurs. We 
then increase the length of the wave rather sharply and if the 
reflex appears we again increase the wave length. We finally 
reach a point where the reflex breaks down, even when punish- 
ment is used to restore it—approximately at 760uy. This wave 
length represents the human being’s spectral range at the red 
end. We then follow the same procedure with respect to the 
violet end (397yn). In this way we determine the individual’s 
range just as surely as if we had stimulated the subject with 
monochromatic lights varying in wave lengths and asked him if 
he ‘‘saw’’ them. A use similar to this is possible in all the other 
sense fields, sound, cutaneous, smell, taste, ete. Even as we have 
discussed the method, it is also serviceable in the study of fatigue, 
adaptation and in the investigation of many other problems that 
lie in the borderland between physiology and psychology.

reflex occurred. The second record shows that the negative stimulus (a different bell) 
was given, that no punishment was given with it, and that the reflex appeared (conditioned, 
but undifferentiated reflex). Then followed eight stimulations with the negative bell to 
produce fatigue to the negative stimulus. After fatigue the positive bell was given, but 
with no punishment; the reflex appeared. The negative bell was next given but no reflex 
appeared. The aoe ae bell was again sounded and the reflex appeared (differentiation). 
It will be noticed that respiratory changes occur at every stimiulation. There is a deep 
inspiration each time either of the bells is sounded, and giso slowing in rate. When 
training is continued long enough, differentiation occurs in respiration. (See Vig. 4.) ‘That is, in a short time only the positive bell can produce the chdénges shown in this drawing.

‘We may employ it in some cases as a substitute for the verbal 
report method. In order to use it in the place of the latter 
method, we have to arrange conditions so that the reflex will ap- 
pear when, for example, a red light is given, but not when a violet 
light is given; or when a tone of 256 d.v. is given, and not when 
one of 264 d.v. is given. By using the method in this way it 
becomes possible to state what the smallest difference in wave 
length between two lights must be in order to arouse differential 
reaction ; the smallest vibration difference between two tones; the

smallest difference in intensity between two tones of the same 
pitch or two lights of the same wave length. In other words, 
instead of asking the subject as we do in the verbal report 
method: Is this light brighter or dimmer than another light, or, 
Ts this tone lower or higher than that tone?—we use the condi- 
tioned reflex method. The technic is as follows: Suppose our prob- 
lem is to establish a conditioned reflex to.a tuning fork of a certain 
pitch (256 d.v.) and to a second fork of a different pitch (264 
d.v:). We will call these two forks F, (positive) and F, (nega- 
tive). As in the method already described, we give the electric 
stimulus with F, until the reflex appears. The recording system is 
   
-P-A-G-E-52
    38 . PSYCHOLOGY 
shown in Fig. 3. After this is thoroughly established we throw 
in F, and the reflex, of course, will appear. We then continue 
stimulating with F,, but never introduce the electric stimulus 
coincidently with it. After five or ten stimulations in rapid 
succession with F,, the reflex to it will disappear. We then sud- 
denly throw in F, and if the reflex does not appear we introduce 
punishment. After this procedure has been continued for some 
time we finally reach the desired stage where, without any elec- 
trical stimulus at all, the reflex will always appear with F, but 
will not with F,. It now remains to see how fine we can make 
this difference. In order to test this we gradually decrease the 
vibration difference between F, and F,. (Figs. 4 and 5 show 
a difference limen which was developed in a very short time.) 
Other Objective Methods.—The conditioned reflex methods 
have been looked upon as the only objective methods in psy- 
chology. This is not true when we consider psychological methods 
in a broad way. All methods used in reaction time experiments 
and in experiments on ‘‘memory’’ and association are purely 
objective methods: much of the testing work, the work in experi- 
mental pedagogy and in business psychology, has been done 
with the aid of objective methods. 
III. Versau Report Mernops. 
Introduction.—The methods so far discussed have dealt with 
the integrated motor and glandular behavior of individuals other 
than ourselves. The methods have been largely developed by and 
have come into prominence through the study of animal behavior 
and infant human subjects. Indeed, in these fields we must 
depend largely upon such methods, since the observation of the 
happenings in their own bodies and the verbal reports of the 
same are impossible in the case of animals, or very imperfect in 
the case of abnormal individuals. Man is above all an animal 
which reacts most often and most complexly with speech reac- 
tions. The notion has somehow gained ground that objective 
vsychology does not deal with speech reactions. This, of course, 
is a mistake. It would be foolish and one-sided to an ab- 
surd degree to neglect man’s vocal behavior. Often the sole
-P-A-G-E-53
PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS 39 
observable reaction in man is speech. In other words, his ad- 
justments to situations are made more frequently by speech 
than through action of the remaining motor mechanisms. 
We shall in a later chapter develop our notion of the implicit 
end explicit language adjustments. We wish here mainly 
to show the use of speech reactions as a part of general psycho- 
logical methods. As an illustration of the use of the verbal 
report method in an actual experiment we may glance for a 
moment at the tests on sensitivity to warmth and cold on a given 
area of the skin. We first mark off a small area and go over 
it with a warm and a cold cylinder: we say to the subject, ‘‘Tell 
us each time the cold cylinder is applied and each time the warm 
cylinder is applied.’’ If the area touched is sensitive to cold he 
responds with the word ‘‘cold,’’ and similarly when the warm 
cylinder is applied with the word ‘‘warm.’’ The verbal report 
or response is put down in our records of the results of the ex- 
periment and is used exactly as the conditioned reflex responses 
would be used had we adopted that form of experimentation 
in our test. 
Is There a Verbal Report Method Distinct from Other 
Observable Methods?—Up to the present time psychologists 
have employed the verbal report method in a somewhat different 
sense from that used here. Without entering into this bitterly 
contested and controversial field, we can briefly outline the posi- 
tion of this text in regard to it. The question: Can I make the 
same observations upon myself that I make on other individuals? 
brings home the difficulties. The answer is, of course, ‘‘yes,’’ but 
it will be remembered that on page 13 we stated that all we 
can observe in another individual is his behavior, and we defined 
behavior as the integrated responses of muscles and glands. 
The question now becomes simpler: Can I observe the move- 
ments of my own muscles and glands and their integration? For 
example, that I am writing, that my face is flushed, ete.? Who 
would deny it? 
At this point we diverge for a moment to correct a miscon- 
ception which has arisen with reference to objective psychology. 
The misconception lies in the fact that a good many psychol- 
   
-P-A-G-E-54
40 PSYCHOLOGY 
  ogists have misunderstood the behaviorist’s position. They insist 
that he is only observing the individual movements of the muscles 
and glands; that he is interested in the muscles and glands in 
exactly the same way the physiologist is interested in them. This 
is not the whole statement. The behaviorist is interested in inte- 
grations and total activities of the individual.. At one moment 
we ask the question: What is the individual doing? We observe 
that he is typewriting, searching for a lost pocket-book or ‘‘react- 
ing’’ to an emotional stimulus. If the latter happens to be true 
and we are interested in the way his emotional life as a whole 
hangs together, we may go on to show why the individual reacts 
in an emotional way to this particular stimulus. We may show 
how his fear reactions to certain situations arose in his infancy 
and how they have affected his whole personality and more 
highly organized habit activities. To illustrate this we may 
give a hypothetical example: Through some injury (or other 
emotional happening) in youth, occasioned by a rapidly moving 
mechanical toy, the individual cannot be induced to enter an 
automobile or motor boat. or to ride in a train if it can possibly 
be avoided. In the occupations and activities of individuals we 
do not stop as a rule to reduce the total activity to muscle 
twitches. We can do it if necessary and we do do it at times 
when it becomes necessary to study the various part reactions. 
Surely objective psychology can study brick-laying, house build- 
ing, playing games, marriage or emotional activity without 
being accused of reducing everything to muscle twitch or the 
secretion of a gland. It is just as fair to accuse the behaviorist, 
or indeed the conventional psychologist as far as that goes, 
of reducing everything to the ionic constitution of matter. 
All of us believe that matter is constituted as the physicist would 
have us believe, but his formulation does not help us very much 
in specifie psychological problems. On the psychological side, 
we can describe a man’s behavior in selecting and marrying a 
wife. We can show how that event has influenced his whole life 
after marriage. In detail, how the increased responsibility 
stabilized certain emotional mal-adjustments, how the added 
financial burden led him to work longer hours and to study the
-P-A-G-E-55
PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS 41 
details of his profession so that his salary would be increased and 
his number of business connections enlarged. It would not help 
us very much in the present state of science to be able to trace 
the molecular changes in cell constitution—they certainly exist, 
but are aside from our problem. Our problem is the effect of 
marriage upon the general behavior of this one individual. 
In the psychological laboratory we do find it necessary often 
to study the details of the total activity we see in daily life. 
When it becomes necessary to make such observations we find it 
extremely difficult to observe the part or individual reactions of 
our own bodies. We pointed out above that observation is often 
impossible without the use of instrumentation and the control 
of the experimental setting. Hence the movements which we 
would have to make in the manipulation of the instruments 
and the setting would interfere always with the movements we 
are trying to observe in ourselves. It is perfectly possible for 
a subject to make observations by the use of his eyes of the num- 
ber of drops coming from the salivary glands after some one has 
attached the apparatus for him; but in reaching for acids, water 
to wash out the mouth, ete., certain variable factors are intro- 
duced which disturb the purity and the scientific character of 
the observation. Physiology has to answer this same question; 
but who doubts that the physiologist ean make observations of 
a kind upon his own heart, respiration, and movements of the 
food particles in the intestines? But if the physiologist limited 
himself to what he could learn from observing and experiment- 
ing upon his own organs, he would long ago have given up the 
science. But now and then the physiologist and the physician, 
like other human beings, observe that something goes wrong 
with one of their organs. They immediately put themselves into 
the hands of a skilled observer who brings all of the technic of 
modern science to bear upon the observation he is about to make. 
His report may be that there are adhesions, mitral leaks, or an 
enlarged spleen. In other words, in physiology and in medicine 
self-observation is crude and inexact and is discarded just as soon 
as other methods can be brought to bear. We suffer in psychology 
to-day greatly because methods for observing what goes on in 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
42 PSYCHOLOGY 
  another individual’s internal mechanisms in general are lacking. 
For this reason we have to depend in part at least upon his own 
report of what is taking place. We are gradually breaking away 
from this inexact method; we shall break away very rapidly 
when the need is more generally recognized. Suppose we have 
a subject in the laboratory. We record his arm and finger re- 
sponses to a given experimental situation. During the course of 
the experiment we may also want to know whether there is an 
increased tension in the leg muscles. We ask the subject: When 
you move your hands in this experiment do your leg muscles 
contract? He may say ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘no’’ and he may be right. 
But if we want a scientific answer to depend upon, we immedi- 
ately attach an instrument which will record any change in the 
tension of the leg muscles. We discard crude self-observation 
and turn to instrumentation wherever it is necessary or possible. 
But in many spheres of psychology and especially in psy- 
chiatry, self-observation, which is usually expressed in words by 
the subject, is the only kind of observation at our immediate dis- 
posal. The patient comes to the psychiatrist. and says: ‘‘I feel 
‘sad’ and ‘gloomy’ ’’; or, ‘‘Doctor, I am under a terrible strain 
—I fear I am going to kill my wife and children.’’? This is a 
psychological situation which the physician must meet. The 
physician then by a series of skillful questions begins to take the 
word responses of the patient. These responses, however, are 
from the physician’s standpoint. as objective as would be a mov- 
ing-picture photograph of the subject’s activity in weaving a rug 
or basket. The responses are a part of the record of the 
subject’s way of adjusting to his world. These responses the 
physician can in virtue of his past training connect with the 
remote and immediate situations in the life of the patient which 
have produced the mal-adjustment. The physician has found 
that when speech reactions of such and such types are made by 
the patient, they are to be associated with disturbances of the 
remaining action systems—the individual’s action systems are no 
longer integrated and no longer function as a unit, as is neces- 
sarily the case when the patient is well.

IV. Meruops or Tpstine. 
Introduction.—Psychological tests of one kind or another 
have been in use since the founding of psychology. During the 
early history of psychology, tests were developed largely around 
sensory reactions. Fairly serviceable tests of keenness of vision, 
auditory acuity and color defects have been in use for more than 
fifty years. Sometime later methods of testing accuracy of 
motor codrdination, speed of reacting to simple and complex 
situations appeared. Until the last two decades such tests were 
incorporated in the general treatment of psychology. These tests 
were looked upon as a part of the routine of the laboratory and 
no particular use was made of them except in the testing of 
railway and marine engineers. Within the past twenty years 
there has grown up a veritable school of testers which has ab- 
stracted the sensory methods from psychology and added a very 
much larger number of special tests. Since the time of Binet’s 
early work, tests have gradually taken on a broader character. 
They have had to do with general abilities, ‘‘intelligence level’’ 
correlated with age and with occupations, rather than with the 
special senses. The field of testing is now extensive and even 
though the value of the results obtained from the various methods 
is not yet agreed upon, it is generally admitted that this work is in 
line with common-sense and has wide possibilities of still further 
extension. In general we may consider the tests under three 
headings: (1) general behavior tests for determining whether 
the individual possesses the various functions and the degree 
of plasticity (capability of forming new habits) demanded by 
society (so-called intelligence tests) ; (2) tests of special ability, 
and (3) research and statistical work in tests. 
A good many psychologists are inclined, or were inclined in 
the beginning, to look upon tests as a development of a purely 
practical side of psychology, and hence asserted that they be- 
longed wholly to applied psychology. But by degrees this differ- 
ence between ‘‘pure’’ and ‘‘applied’’ science has given way in 
psychology as it has in other fields. Now we look upon tests as 
we look upon any other group of methods in psychology. When 
the psychologist has special need of making them he either uses 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
44 PSYCHOLOGY 
  a test already available or else goes about in a systematic way the 
development of a test to suit his needs. He does this, or he should 
do this, in the same spirit that he would carry out other psycho- 
logical investigations. On the whole though this distinction is 
valid, viz., that psychological experimentation is carried out usu- 
ally without any reference to the immediate usability or applica- 
bility of the results, whereas the tests are used in practical 
situations and are (or ought to be) scientifically developed in the 
laboratory in order to meet practical situations. 
The tests so far developed have had most to do with the 
language behavior of individuals and depend largely upon the 
individual’s ability to speak; that is, they have concerned them- 
selves with the ease and complexity of the language response to 
social and other environmental settings. This is, of course, un- 
fortunate since we have many individuals who are deprived of 
speech altogether and many others with defective speech 
(aphasies and bad stammerers, for example), and still others 
who speak only the most difficult foreign languages. The ability 
of such individuals to do certain things with their hands, to 
form certain habits with the remaining musculature of their 
bodies, has not been disturbed. To meet such cases, and indeed 
to serve many other purposes as well, very much greater em- 
phasis should be laid upon tests of explicit and overt types of 
behavior where language is not necessary.2, Owing to the re- 
markable but widespread notion that language behavior has 
some peculiarly great significance, the development of perform- 
ance tests has been seriously handicapped. We can give only a 
brief characterization of the various types of tests here. 
1. Tests to Determine the General Level of Behavior.— 
The validity of general behavior tests depends upon the fact that 
in individuals of approximately the same age and from the 
same general environment, certain systems of common activi- 
ties are developed. A. has been brought out before, this expected 
or demanded level of activity is a purely conventional one. 
Nevertheless, every individual must be possessed of a certain 
minimal set of assets and activities, such as speed in forming 
? Some of the recent army tests have met this difficulty.  
-P-A-G-E-59
  PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS 45 
habits, number of habits and a certain level of language attain- 
ment; of certain methods of attack upon problems and conven- 
tional modes of reacting to parents, teachers and companions. 
If the individual is lacking in any of these requirements, a prop- 
erly devised test should bring the matter out. Certain tests 
have been developed which bring out the completeness or incom- 
pleteness of such accomplishment with respect to age. We can, 
for example, give an individual of eight years all of the tests 
from six to nine years. It he passes all up to and including the 
eighth year, we say that his attainments are normal. If his 
attainments age is near that of a six-year-old child, we say that 
the individual is two years retarded. The mere fact that the 
individual may be two years retarded calls for special considera- 
tion of his case. Is he two years retarded because he has-been 
ill aud has not been able to go to school to the same extent as 
other children of his age? Has he been in a region where he was 
not able to go to school? Is there any particular psychosis of 
a permanent or temporary character which has been instrumental 
in producing retardation? Or has the youth constitutional de- 
fects which make it impossible for him to put on the habits 
required of the other children in his group? The special con- 
sideration of the retarded child thus requires the codperation of 
a psychologist, a psychiatrist and oftentimes of a surgeon. 
Serious damage is often done to individuals who are passed upon 
by a physician alone or by a psychologist alone. 
The scales or special tests used in this practical way are those 
of Binet-Simon with their various modifications at the hands of 
Terman, Yerkes, Goddard and others, and the performance tests 
of Healy, Pintner and many others. The various special tests 
described below may also be utilized to determine the general be- 
havior level of individuals. By the use of special tests in arith- 
metic, vocabulary, speed and accuracy of habit formation, we 
rrive at a much more just estimate of the individual’s capabil- 
cies than by any of the tests for general behavior. Indeed, few 
f the modifications of the Binet-Simon and other general testing 
ethods are serviceable beyond the 15th year. In estimating an 
adult’s attainments we usually have to employ many special tests.     
                                  
    
   
-P-A-G-E-60
  46 PSYCHOLOGY 
2. Tests of Special Ability——On account of various practical 
demands upon the psychologist both in the realm of the evalua- 
tion of attainment in schools and in the economie world, a num- 
ber of tests too numerous for special mention have grown up 
for the determination of special abilities. Tests have already 
been devised for determining the range of general information 
of an individual, information along a particular line, his mathe- 
matical ability, his vocabulary, English, handwriting, musical 
ability, ingenuity, the possibility of his attaining success in the 
fields of railway engineering, telephony, stenography, music and 
aviation. These special ability tests are sometimes used jointly 
in abbreviated form for running applicants through who are 
desirous of entering certain vocations. The tests are gradually 
becoming wider in their scope so as to include personality fac- 
tors, for example, whether an individual is arrogant, proud, neat, 
whether he is friendly, or emotionally unstable. It has indeed 
been suggested that the psychiatrists might assist the psycholo- 
gists in determining whether a candidate for the more important 
positions has the proper characteristics and temperament to make 
him desirable. In connection with this it may be said that an 
individual’s characteristics are dependent to a large extent upon 
the various conflicts and stresses and strains against which he 
has had to contend from infaney through adolescence +o his 
present age. Some further discussion of this is given on page 435. 
3. Research and Statistical Work in Tests.—So far in our 
discussion of tests we have assumed the existence of more or 
less adequate tests for a given purpose. Such tests now at 
hand for practical use have been developed by means of actual 
research work. Suppose, for example, we have to develop a test 
for determining an individual’s qualifications for filling a posi- 
tion in stenography. We first set down the various character- 
istics and attainments we desire such an individual to have. We 
then go into any large stenographic office and still further 
crease our knowledge concerning the speed a successful indivia ¥ 
should have in taking dictation, speed in typewriting from wr 
ten material and copying from stenographic notes, length of tix 
it takes the best individuals to make copies of letters, ability 
      
-P-A-G-E-61
    PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS 47 
spell, to write unusual words, to file letters and to find letters 
in a file. On the basis of this wider knowledge we construct a 
series of performance tests which take, say, half an hour for any 
stenographer to go through. We may find that our first test is 
entirely too complicated and that only three or four of the best 
individuals in a large typewriting office can pass it. But we are 
just as likely, on the other hand, to make a test which is too easy, 
so easy indeed that even the poorest members of the group can 
pass it. We then work at the method until the average good 
stenographer can pass the test. Naturally the test must be 
constructed with reference to the field of general stenographic 
work. This test would not be suitable for accountants, for news- 
paper reporters or for any other vocational field. Such work 
is being done constantly by many business houses in consultation 
with psychologists. Indeed, many of the larger business houses 
now employ psychological experts for devising such tests. The 
construction of the test is a research problem. The use of the 
test can possibly be left to individuals who are not psychologists, 
but who may have received special instructions in its use. 
A slightly different task it at hand when we have to ask the 
question: What are the general factors which enter into the 
make-up of a successful lawyer, statesman, newspaper corre- 
spondent, or aviator. We may say in advance that no very ser- 
viceable correlations throwing light upon such questions have 
yet been obtained. To make the problem specific we may take 
up the study of the make-up of a successful aviator: What factors 
in the previous life of the aviator make for success in flying? 
Has the amount and kind of academic education anything to do 
with it? The stratum of society from which he comes, age, pre- 
vious occupation and salary obtained in it, marriage, and athletic 
attainments? To answer the question the necessary data are 
obtained from successful and unsuccessful pilots. The material 
so obtained is then subjected to statistical treatment and the 
co-efficients of correlation obtained.*

to which such correlations have been worked out see Thorndike’s article

CHAPTER III 
THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 
Introduction.—As has already been pointed out, the under- 
standing of the nature of human response depends to a large 
extent upon a knowledge of the various types of stimuli which 
affect man; of the places where such stimuli must be applied in 
order to produce appropriate action; and of the various physical 
and physiological factors which must be taken into account in 
the control of both the organism and the stimulus. To make this 
concrete we need only to mention the fact that if the skin of cer- 
tain animals is stimulated by light of high intensity an overt 
response will be produced. In man, light, neglecting its heat 
value, must fall upon a certain part of the eye if action is to be 
produced. Furthermore, light necessary to produce an overt 
response in man must have a wave length not less than 397pp 
(violet) and not greater than 760» (red). To bring these fac- 
tors out, we must to a certain extent ‘‘dissect’’ our human being 
and find the parts which are sensitive to stimulation (bodily 
areas which each sense organ comprises) and the adequate stimuli 
which, when applied upon these sense organ areas, will produce 
action. It must be borne in mind that this procedure is some- 
what artificial and like the one the physiologist uses when he 
studies the heart action, respiration, ete., to the exclusion of the 
other bodily functions. In later chapters, however, we will put 
the organisms together, as it were, and study our creation from 
the standpoint of its reactions as a whole. We must never lose 
sight of the fact that when man reacts to even the most. minute 
sensory stimulus, the whole body codperates in the reaction, even 
if he only raises a finger or says the word ‘‘red.’’ 
A General Neuro-Muscular Consideration.—We shall find 
in Chapter V that in every simple reflex act, such as the with- 
drawal of the hand from a hot object, there is involved-on the 
structural side a receptor, or sense-organ structure, a set of neural 
conductors and an effector (muscle or gland), When a sense 
48  
-P-A-G-E-63
  THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 49 
structure, like the eye, ear or nose, is played upon by a stimulus, 
a chemical process of some kind is started which releases a neural 
impulse in the system of conductors. This neural impulse passes 
through the conductors, finally reaching the muscle or gland. 
Under the action of this impulse, the muscle shortens or the 
gland begins to secrete. The animal thus moves or acts. In 
order to have these various mechanisms clearly before us, we 
shall have to study (1) the sense organ side of. man: the eye, the 
ear, the senses of touch, olfaction, warmth, cold, pain, the organic 
and the kinesthetic; (2) the neural or conducting mechanism, 
i.e., the peripheral and central nervous systems (and the sym- 
pathetic nervous system) ; (3) the motor and glandular systems— 
the effectors, consisting of the striped muscles which are under 
the control of the peripheral and central nervous systems, and 
the unstriped muscles and glands which are usually under the 
control of the sympathetic. The student should formulate his 
problem somewhat as follows: ‘‘(1) What extra-organie and 
intra-organic stimuli will cause my subject, man, to act; how 
ean I arrange simple and complex situations which will cause 
him to act in harmony with environmental demands? (2) From 
my-general reading it would appear that the function of the 
stimulus is to arouse a neural impulse. I want to know for both 
practical and theoretical reasons what the course of this neural 
impulse is, 7.e., how it finds a way to the muscle, because if there 
happens to be a defect, either anatomical or functional in this 
chain of conductors, I know that any stimulus I may apply will 
not lead to the usual reaction. (3) In order to understand what 
can be done with man in the way of establishing integrated sys- 
tems of response, I must have at least an elementary knowledge 
of the ways in which muscles, tendons and joints function; and 
know something about the kinds of glands he has, and the 
influence of these glands upon the muscles.’’ The student who 
has had no physiology will find it profitable to read straight 
through the three chapters on the sense organs, the conductors, 
and the muscles and glands, and then turn back and study in 
detail the chapters in the order in which they appear. In our 
study of the sense organs which immediately follows, we shall 
4  
-P-A-G-E-64
50 PSYCHOLOGY 
have to neglect many points of interest. Only the common and 
more every-day phenomena of sensory physiology are treated here. 
I. SENSE ORGANS IN THE SKIN (CUTANEOUS) AND THEIR 
ADEQUATE STIMULI. 
  Area.—The whole surface of the skin, including the red por- 
tion of the lips, the conjunctiva and cornea of the eye, the mucous 
membrane lining the mouth 
and other external openings 
of the body, must be looked

1 and 2. The Temperature Sense.—The adequate stimuli for 
these senses are, from the standpoint of physics, heat radiation. 
From the practical standpoint, they are objects: metal, wood, 
fluids and gases (air), being the most common examples. To

initiate activity it is not necessary to bring such objects into 
direct contact with the skin. In general in order to affect the 
cold sense, their temperature must be lower than the so-called 
physiological zero, approximately 30° C. The physiological zero 
is not fixed, but depends upon the state of adaptation of the 
sense organ. If the temperature of the objects is above this point, 
the warm sense is called into function. The end organs of tem- 
perature can also be stimulated from within by organic changes 
which occur in fevers, in extreme emotions, either through con- 
stricture of the blood-vessels (cold) or by dilatation (warmth). 
They may also be stimulated mechanically by the action of sub- 
stances like mustard, pepper, alcohol or menthol, by an electrical 
current and possibly even by mechanical stimulation—slight 
tapping, puncturing with a needle, etc. Extremes of tempera- 
ture tend to destroy the tissue, and hence objects of excessively 
high temperature stimulate both the warm sense and the pain 
sense. The essential factor in providing a temperature stimulus 
is the bringing about of thermal changes in the skin. Unless the 
temperature of any part of the skin can be changed, fairly rap- 
idly at that, there is no response. This can be illustrated by the 
old example of immersing the frog and then raising the tem- 
perature very gradually. The death of the frog occurs before 
a temperature (or pain) response is obtained. 
Punctiform Type of Stimulation.—In making a systematic 
and detailed investigation of these senses, one usually marks off 
on the skin a small, well-defined area and goes over it with a 
hollow point of metal which can be kept at a constant tempera- 
ture by passing through it a fluid—water for warmth and moder- 
ate degrees of cold, alcohol or other anti-freezing fluids if low 
temperatures are to be used. For ordinary work the point of 
metal should be kept at about 12° to 15° C. when the cold sense 
is being investigated, and 37° to 40° C. when working with the 
warm sense. If the skin is gone over in a punctiform way, it is 
found that characteristic responses can be obtained only at cer- 
tain definite circumscribed spots or points (14 mm. or less in 
area). Moreover, points which respond to the cold metal point 
are distinct from those which respond to the warm. Appar-  
-P-A-G-E-66
  52 PSYCHOLOGY 
ently they are permanent: that is, the spots are probably situ- 
ated immediately above the true sense-organ structure lying 
within the skin. In general it is found that those regions which 
are most responsive to pressure stimuli as, e.g., the hands and 
finger tips, are less responsive to temperature. Parts which are 
usually covered with clothing.are more responsive to temperature 
than those which are left uncovered, partly because of lack of 
exposure to changes, but also because they are more generously 
supplied with temperature organs. The face is exceedingly 
sensitive, although in most countries it is left uncovered. It is 
found to be richly supplied with sensory structures. The 
threshold of stimulation of these spots varies widely.t Stimula- 
tion of certain warm spots will produce response when the tem- 
perature of the object is only slightly above the physiological 
zero, while the more resistant are not stimulated except by tem- 
peratures lying around 40° C. The cold spots show equal vari- 
ation in the intensity of the threshold stimulus. The number of 
spots sensitive to these forms of stimuli in any given square 
centimeter differs widely on the different parts of the body. In 
general the cold spots are much more numerous than the warm   
1There are two kinds of thresholds. Liminal thresholds, abbreviated 
R. L.: by this is meant merely that any stimulus in any sense field can be 
made so weak that the work it does upon the sense organ is not sufficient 
to produce either an explicit or an implicit response. The state of adapta- 
tion or the amount of work the sense organ has just done may affect the 
magnitude of the stimulus necessary to produce a response. The differential 
threshold (D, L.) always involves two stimuli: a subject may react to a 
white light of a given photometric value. Suppose we introduce a second 
white light. By how much must we increase (or decrease) the intensity 
of this second light in order to have at hand the condition for the subject 
to react in one way to the first light, and in another way to the second 
light? Reactions to such stimuli are called in the text differential reactions 
or responses. There is a separate division of psychology which deals almost 
exclusively with such relations of stimuli. It is called quantitative psy- 
chology. The originators of this type of study were Weber and Fechner. 
Their studies have been incorporated into so-called laws—the Weber law 
and the Fechner law, or the Weber-Fechner law. On account of the very 
narrow application of quantitative psychology and by reason of the tech- 
nical difficulties in the way of its study, it is neglected in this text, although 
the subject matter belongs to objective psychology.

  spots. On the average the proportion is about 13 cold spots to 
2 warm spots. In the matter of the distribution of these spots, 
attention is called to the fact that the conjunctiva of the eye and 
the external mucous’ membrane of the genital organs are insen- 
sitive to warmth but sensitive to cold. 
Areal Stimulation.—Punctiform stimulation such as we have 
just described rarely occurs in the daily life of man. It is the 
cold wind striking all of the exposed surfaces of the body which 
leads him to put on his overcoat or to go to the coal yards and 
lay in his winter supply of fuel. It is the warm rays of the sun 
that make him doff his winter garments and eagerly hunt rail- 
way time-tables for summer resorts. Areal stimulation may, 
apart from daily life, be investigated in the laboratory. A. 
thermal stimulation distributed over a large area of the skin is 
reacted to more strongly than if the same temperature is applied 
to a smaller area. A temperature which will just not produce 
a reflex withdrawal when the finger alone is dipped into a fluid 
will produce a withdrawal movement if the whole hand or arm 
is immersed. Most of us have many times tested our bath water 
with the finger tips, jumping in only to bounce out again when 
the entire leg or body is suddenly immersed. Objects with 
different heat conductivities affect. markedly the reactions of the 
subject. Water at 25°C. is a stronger cold stimulus than oil at 
the same temperature, but less strong than mereury. In addi- 
tion to the heat-conducting properties, the action (as seen in 
R.L. and D. L.) induced by the temperature of an object depends 
to some extent upon the smoothness or roughness of its surface. 
Paradoxical Arousal of Cold Spots.—In areal stimulation 
another factor enters in when the temperature of the object lies 
between 45° to 50° C. If we select and mark out on the skin a 
certain number of cold spots and then stimulate each by a metal 
point at this temperature, a reaction to cold will be obtained. In 
other words, temperatures from 45° to 50° C. are (‘‘inade- 
quate’’) stimuli for the cold spots. This means evidently that 
when large areas are stimulated with objects possessing such 
temperatures, both warm and cold spots are functioning. In 
other words, our general reactions to such temperatures are due
-P-A-G-E-68
54 PSYCHOLOGY 
  to a complex stimulation, viz., the adequate or normal stimulation 
of the warm spots and the inadequate or paradoxical stimulation 
of the cold. 
3. The Pressure Sense.—The stimulus to the pressure sense 
is the deformation of the skin surface. In daily life objects such 
as wood, metal, jets of air or other gases, fluids, mechanical im- 
pacts upon the surface of the skin, pulling, wrinkling of the 
skin, touching a hair, ete., all produce deformation of the skin 
and hence serve as pressure stimuli. The best method for investi- 
gating this sense organ is to stimulate a small area with a series 
of hairs or bristles of varying length and thickness.” If an area 
is gone over in a uniform way, as was suggested above for the 
temperature sense, it will be found that spots appear at which 
reactions may be obtained. It will be noted, further, that these 
spots are distinct from those of temperature. Distinctions 
should be made between hairy and non-hairy areas. Movement 
of the hair itself serves as a pressure stimulation. If the hair is 
shaved off and the position of each hair is marked and the area 
then gone over in a punctiform way, it will be found that there 
is a pressure spot on the skin to the windward of each hair (the 
hairs enter the skin at an angle). Every part of the skin is sup- 
plied with pressure spots with few exceptions. The cornea is 
said to contain no pressure spots. The parts most richly supplied 
with pressure spots are the tip of the tongue, the red part of 
the lips and the finger tips. Not only are the spots more numer- 
ous here, but their thresholds are lowest. The average number 
of spots per square centimeter is about 25, but they may drop 
to as low as 7 or go as high as 300. 
4. The Pain Sense.—Any object which will prick, cut, burn 
or tear the tissue will serve as a stimulus for calling out pain 
reactions. It can be aroused by mechanical, thermal, electrical 
and chemical means. If a very small skin area is moistened 
thoroughly and gone over with a finely ground needle-point, the

not affected by dampness and are always straight and do not alter their

THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 55 
pain spots can be located. They are far more numerous than 
any of the other cutaneous spots. Pain spots do not usually 
coincide with cold, warmth or pressure spots. The threshold 
for pain is far greater than that for pressure. Stimulation of 
small areas shows that sensitivity to pressure is 1000 times 
greater than that to pain. The cornea is richly supplied with 
pain spots. Any stimulus applied to the cornea, if above the 
limen, will produce a strong reflex movement. The posterior 
portion of the mouth cavity and the back of the tongue are not 
well supplied with pain spots. In the mucous membrane of the 
‘ cheeks (opposite lower second molar) pain spots are absent in 
many subjects. 
End Organs Affected by Cutaneous Stimuli.—So far in this 
work we have not had occasion to study the nervous system in 
its relation to the sense organs on the one hand and to the muscles 
on the other. In Chapter IV this relationship will be taken up. 
All that needs to be said now is that every sense, be it the eye, 
ear, smell or taste, has within it highly modified sensory struc- 
tures which are affected by the characteristic stimuli for that 
sense. One must look upon them as the chemical laboratory in 
which the energy is liberated that initiates the nerve impulse. 
These sense-organ structures (cells) are usually not a part of the 
nervous system, but are highly modified epithelial structures 
around which the nerve fibers end. 
In the outer layer or epidermis of the skin we find the first 
sense structures. The nerve fiber loses its sheath or covering 
after passing into the epidermis and splits up into numerous 
branches which end in between the cells of the skin (the epithelial 
cells). The endings sometimes pierce these cells or end between 
any two in small nodules. The epidermis is very richly supplied 
with nerves ending in this manner. These are the so-called free 
nerve endings. In the upper layer of the true skin we find the 
complex corpuscles of Meissner and of Dogiel and the papillary 
endings of Ruffini, also the corpuscles or end-bulbs of Golgi-Maz- 
zoni, Finally in the deep layers of the skin we find the Pacini 
corpuscles and the corpuscles or cylinders of Ruffini. In addition

These are exceedingly numerous in non-hairy skin areas (after Dogiel); H, ter- mination upon a tendon sheath (after Huber and DeWitt); I, muscle spindle (after Ruffini).

-P-A-G-E-71
  THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 57 
to these principal forms there are many other transitional ones. 
The hairs are also supplied with a highly specialized form of 
nerve ending and must be looked upon as veritable sense organs. 
Fig. 7 shows an assemblage of some of the forms of sensory 
structures most frequently met with in the skin. 
Anatomical and physiological researches have not gone far 
enough for us to assign with certainty definite functions to the 
various sensory structures we find in the skin. It may be said 
with some slight probability that the Golgi-Mazzoni end-bulbs 
or corpuscles. and the corpuscles of Dogiel are selective to or 
thrown into action by cold stimuli; that the deep-lying cor- 
puscles of Pacini and Ruffini are probably thrown into action 
by warmth stimuli. The evidence for these assignments is 
slender. It has been found that the conjunctiva of the eye does 
not initiate responses to warmth stimuli. Anatomical examina- 
tion shows that the end-bulb type of ending is present but not 
the Pacini and Ruffini corpuscles. It has been found by experi- 
ment that the reaction time (time between application of the 
stimulus and the subject’s reaction) to a warmth stimulus is 
longer than the reaction time to any other cutaneous stimulus. 
Since the Pacini and Ruffini corpuscles lie usually in the deepest 
layers of the skin, their relationship is understandable if those 
structures are selective to warmth. 
The nerve plexuses around the hairs are the pressure sense 
organs in the hairy areas of the body. On the non-hairy areas, 
Meissner’s corpuscles are probably the pressure organs. Where 
pressure sensitivity is most highly developed, as on the finger 
tips, the hand, the tongue and the red area of the lips, the 
Meissner corpuscles are very numerous. On the hairy areas there 
are very few of them. 
Finally, there is some evidence that the free nerve endings 
in the epidermis are the sense organs selective to pain stimuli; 
the evidence for this is mainly one of distribution. The pain 
spots are very numerous, as we have observed. The only sensory 
structures in the skin in sufficient quantities to care for this dis- 
tribution are the free nerve endings.

Il. Tae Kinazsruetic SENSE. 
Area and Stimuli—tThe bodily tissues in which kinesthetic 
impulses originate are (1) the muscles, (2) the tendons and (3) 
the articular surfaces. In all of these tissues lie special sense 
organ structures which are described on page 59. On account 
of the location of these organs, few investigations have been made 
upon them alone. It is impossible to stimulate them, since they 
lie so deeply imbedded in the tissues of muscles and tendons, 
without at the same time stimulating the cutaneous organs lying 
above them. Hence it is with difficulty that we can define the 
stimulus which affects them. Some success has attended our 
efforts to more exactly define the stimuli by anesthetizing (co- 
caine injection or ether spray) the cutaneous area. It has been 
found that when the cutaneous organs are thrown out of func- 
tion, heavy pressure upon the muscle or tendon will still bring 
out a response. If the pressure is made great enough, pain 
responses can be obtained. In a similar way it has been found 
that the sensory structures in the muscles can be stimulated by 
forcing a contraction of the muscle by means of an electric cur- 
rent.? Likewise, the pinching, pulling and forced contractions 
of the muscles affect the sensory structures both in the tendons 
and in the surfaces around the joints. Kinesthetic sense organs 
are generally stimulated by a movement of the tissues themselves 
under the influence of normal muscular contraction. This con- 
traction of the muscle stimulates at the same time the structures 
in the tendons and in the joint surfaces. This occurs most fre- 
quently in walking, talking, drinking, eating, ete.; that is, when- 
ever an explicit bodily movement is made. The student cannot 
grasp too early the fact that while the muscles, tendons and joint 
surfaces are motor mechanisms, they are at the same time highly 
important sense organs as well. The muscles usually have a 
definite tone; that is, they are neither fully contracted nor fully 
extended. Whenever a muscle either elongates or contracts or

in any way changes its length or diameter under the influence of 
the motor nerves, the sensory endings in the muscles, in the ten- 
dons and in the joint surfaces are stimulated and can, as we shall 
show later (page 316), arouse new motor impulses, which in turn 
can arouse new kinesthetic stimulation, this process being re- 
peated again and again until a series of related acts is executed. 
From this one will quickly grasp the fact that in the functioning 
of a perfect habit nearly everything is turned over to the kin- 
esthetic system (page 317). It is, of course, obvious that the 
length of the muscle cannot be changed very greatly without at 
the same time arousing some cutaneous impulses, so that even 
in executing most habitual acts the cutaneous sense organs are 
involved. It is well for the student to consider just how an 
animal, deprived of all of its senses except the kinesthetic, could 
execute an act (assuming, of course, that enough organic pro- 
cesses are functioning to keep the animal alive). It would prob- 
ably be surprising to see how well such an animal could get 
about, or even thread a complicated maze. In thinking over this 
it might be well to recall that even an extremely fine singer’s 
voice is little disturbed by anesthetizing the larynx with cocaine, 
which throws the cutaneous sense organs in the mucous surfaces 
out of gear, but does not affect the sense organs in the muscles 
and tendons. 
Types of Kinzsthetic Sense Organ Structures—In Fig. 7 
are shown some of the more characteristic sensory endings serv- 
ing the kinesthetic sense as a whole. The most highly specialized 
sensory nerve ending in the muscle itself is the muscle spindle. 
In the transitional portions between muscle fibers and tendon 
fibers, one finds the highly important musculo-tendinous cor- 
puscle of Golgi. In the muscle sheaths, tendinous sheaths and 
joint capsules one finds numerous structures resembling the 
Pacini corpuscles already met with in the skin, known as modi- 
fied Pacini corpuscles. It is well to contrast these sensory end- 
ings in the muscles with the motor nerve endings shown on 
page 177. Nothing further can be said about the special func- 
tions of these endings.

PSYCHOLOGY 
  III. Equitisrium SENss. 
Introduction.—No discussion of the kinesthetic sense is com- 
plete without some reference to the sensory structures in the 
semicircular canals and in the utricle and saccule. The struc- 
ture and function of these organs are somewhat complicated, 
and. it must suffice for our present purpose to give only a few 
central facts. In each ear there are three canals: external, su- 
perior and posterior. The canals are set in the ear in approxi- 
mate conformity with the three dimensions of space. The canals, 
utricle and saccule are really hollowed out of the petrous bone. 
Fig. 8 shows a cast of the bony cavities. Inside of the bony 
cavity will be found a continuous membranous sac, which, in the 
canals, takes closely the general shape of the bony structure, 
while in the utricle and saccule the conformity is less close. In- 
side of this membranous sac is a fluid, the endolymph. Between 
the sac and the bony walls there is the perilymph. Each canal 
is dilated into an ampulla where it joins the utricle. It is in 
these ampulle that the vestibular branch of the eighth cranial 
nerve finds its termination. The ending of the nerve inside 
the membranous sac together with the epithelial cells or sense 
structures are called the crista acustica, Each cell ends in a long 
flexible hair jutting out into the endolymph. The hairs are held 
together by a mucous mass called the cwpula, so that they are 
unable to move individually and freely in the endolymph; the 
nerve fibers end in close connection with these sensory cells. In 
the utricle and saccule there are similar sensory structures, the 
structure as a whole being called the macula acustica. There is 
one macula in the utricle and one in the saccule. The sensory 
cells to be found in the macula are shorter than those in the 
crista. In the macula the hairs are held together by a denser 
mass. Lying among the hairs are to be found small carbonate 
of lime particles called otoliths. 
Stimulus to the Sense of Equilibrium.—Variations in the 
pressure of the endolymph caused by movements of the head 
serve as the adequate stimuli to the hair cells in the canals of the 
ear. The movements of the head must be great enough to dis- 
place the cupula, which as it is displaced stimulates the hair cells.

When these canals are stimulated there occur changes in mus- 
cular tone, probably of every muscle of the whole body. If the 
stimulation is intense the most characteristic reaction to be seen 
is nystagmus of the eyes, a rapid to and fro movement plainly 
   
-P-A-G-E-76
62 PSYCHOLOGY 
  observable without the aid of instruments. If the subject is very 
sensitive, or the stimulation is made more intense, he may vomit. 
The easiest way to observe the phenomena of stimulation of the 
semicircular canals is to hold the head of the subject almost 
vertical and rotate him with eyes closed and ask him to indicate 
the direction in which he is being turned. He does this cor- 
rectly so long as the rate is increasing. If the chair is stopped 
suddenly, the subject will state that he is rotating in the opposite 
direction. It will be found that after several rotations there is 
imparted also the rapid to and fro movement of the eyes men- 
tioned above. If the head is held down during rotation, or to 
one side, other than the external canals will be stimulated. If 
after 10 rotations in 20 seconds the subject is asked to straighten 
up, violent compensatory movements are made. We are thus 
forced to admit that the semicircular canals contain definite 
sense organs which are excited by rotary movements of the head 
in various planes. The sense organ can also be excited electri- 
eally and by the introduction of hot and cold water against the 
ear-drum when the subject is rotated. 
Let us take a concrete case: When the head is upright, or bet- 
ter, inclined at an angle of 30°, the external semicircular canals 
are stimulated when the subject is rotated. If the subject is 
rotated to the left, there will result in both external canals at 
first a movement of the endolymph toward the right on account 
of the inertia of the fluid. This will cause horizontal nystagmus 
of the eye to the left. When rotation ceases, the endolymph 
keeps on moving to the left for a short time. This will give rise 
to a horizontal nystagmus to the right. Usually in rotation ex- 
periments the nystagmus during rotation is neglected and only 
the after-nystagmus observed. If a large number of persons 
are rotated 10 times in 20 seconds, the after-nystagmus will be 
found to endure on the average about 26 plus or minus 10 sec- 
onds. This test has been much used by the otologists for deter- 
mining lesions in the central nervous system. Recently the 
tests have been introduced into the aviation service by a non- 
scientific group of otologists connected with the War Department 
as a qualifying test. Unless the nystagmus falls within the range 
of 26 plus or minus 10 seconds, the candidate is rejected. In 
view of its highly complex nature, involving both habit and 
reflex mechanisms, and in view further of the fact that training 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  
THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 63 
apparently reduces the time of duration of nystagmus, the test, 
so far as is known, really has no significance for aviation (it was 
given up by the British, French and Italian armies after a 
short time). There is no evidence to show that an individual 
who has a balanced nystagmus of, say, 15 seconds and below, or 
one of, say, 37 seconds and above, cannot learn to guide his plane 
and to manage it as successfully as an individual who shows a 
nystagmus falling within the 26 plus or minus 10 limit. 
In stimulating canals with water, no reaction is obtained if 
the temperature is at the physiological zero. Above and below 
this temperature water will serve as a stimulus. The nystagmus 
is in one direction if the water is cold and in the opposite if the 
water is hot. Changing the position of the head changes the 
direction of the nystagmus on any of these caloric tests. In 
stimulating electrically, the positive pole may be placed over one 
ear, the negative over the other, or the ears may be stimulated 
separately by placing one electrode over the ear and the other 
upon some distant part of the body. When both ears are stimu- 
lated simultaneously, a very weak current suffices to bring out 
nystagmus. If the negative pole is over the ear, the nystagmus 
is towards that side; if the positive pole, away from that side. 
Function of the Utricle and Saccule.—In regard to the 
stimulation of the utricle and saccule, there are no very sure 
results. It is supposed that their impulses contribute towards the 
orienting of the body along the line of gravity. This depends, 
of course, largely upon the tactual and kinesthetic impressions, 
as is shown in the shuffling gait of the patient in locomotor ataxia 
where kinesthetic impulses are interfered with. But in swim- 
ming when the body is totally immersed, these tactual impulses 
eannot function differentially; yet the normal subject so im- 
mersed can always correctly indicate the position of the body 
with respect to the vertical. Deaf mutes, whose utricle and sac- 
cule are not functional, are said to be unable to do this. The 
view has been advanced that the saccule and utricle contribute 
impulses which maintain the head equilibrium when the body is 
at rest and during progressive (non-rotary) movements of the 
body. They thus supplement the equilibratory functions of the 
semicircular canals, which operate mainly in head rotation. The 
hair cells in the utricle and saccule are supposed to be stimulated 
by the pressure of the otoliths. When the body is at rest in any 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  64 PSYCHOLOGY 
  position, the otoliths, being heavier than the endolymph, settle 
down in response to gravity, thus stimulating the hair cells. A 
change in the position of the head will again change the position 
of the otoliths, which will again stimulate the hair cells. The 
semicircular canals, the utricle and the saccule must be looked 
upon as a vastly important organ connected through the cere- 
bellum with every striped muscle of the body. Any sudden 
movement of the head will thus initiate impulses which pass 
through the cerebellum and out to the muscles. It should be 
mentioned that the speech habits are apparently not connected 
with the functioning of the vestibular apparatus. The subject 
can give no verbal report about this operation. After they have 
functioned and brought about muscular activity, he may report, 
“*T feel dizzy ; my eyes jump; vision is blurred; I feel like falling 
to the right, etc.”’

Area.—The area in which organic impulses originate com- 
prises in general those organs and tissues which lie in the thoracic, 
abdominal and pelvic cavities. The muscular tissue in which 
the impulses chiefly originate is largely of the unstriped or 
smooth variety (heart, diaphragm, ete., excepted), and hence 
is innervated on the motor side by the autonomic nervous sys- 
tem (page 170); but nearly all of these visceral structures are 
supplied with afferent or sensory nerves belonging to the spinal 
cord or brain. These nerves either end free or else in highly 
specialized structures like the Pacinian corpuscles. When stim- 
ulated, they arouse the neural impulses belonging to the organic 
sense. These impulses, like those from the skin and kinesthetic 
sense organ, pass back to the central nervous system and initiate 
movements of the body as a whole. The organic impulses, as we 
shall see in a moment, are aroused whenever the body must have 
food, water, sex outlets, or be freed from waste products and nox- 
ious substances (such as calculi, infections, or from the effects 
of disturbed or torn internal tissue, etc.). Since the very exist- 
ence of the organism depends upon the adjustment of these 
conditions, the organic impulses exert a powerful influence upon 
the striped muscles of the arms, legs, ete., arousing the general
-P-A-G-E-79
  THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 65 
reactions necessary to bring about adjustment—such as will 
bring food, water, companionship of a member of the opposite 
sex, or make the organism free from substances which irritate 
it. If the environment is such that the objects which would 
bring out the adjustment are not at hand, the individual will 
oftentimes tend to take on the posture or attitude which he would 
take if he were eating or drinking. Kempf has recently called 
attention to the great prevalence of these postural attitudes in 
psychopathological cases, and to their very great variety and 
complexity. 
The sensory endings most frequently stimulated are those 
lying in the diaphragm and other respiratory mechanisms, the 
heart and other circulatory mechanisms, the external peritoneum, 
the stomach and the entrance to the alimentary canal, the soft 
palate, and finally in those structures connected with sex and 
with the elimination of body waste. Probably the great majority 
of the afferent pain endings in the internal structures are never 
called upon to function in a normal individual! They become 
functional in disease; for example, the passage of gall stones, 
infections, ete. It should be mentioned that pain sensitivity 
seems to be lacking in the heart, the arteries and veins, in the 
spleen, pancreas, kidneys and lymphatic glands. The function- 
ing of the organic sense organ proceeds oftentimes without involv- 
ing language. We mean by this merely that if the subject is ques- 
tioned about what processes are going on, he finds it impossible or 
next to impossible to make any kind of a serviceable observation. 
It is true that there is a certain amount of language activity con- 
nected with their functioning; for example, people say that they 
are hungry, thirsty, have pain or colic. But every one must 
admit that the organic sensory motor processes are but poorly 
integrated with speech functions. On account of the wide dis- 
tribution of the sense organ structures and their difficulty of 
access, detailed experimental work is all but impossible. Some 
suecess has been obtained by indirect methods, by the swallow-   
‘The pain endings in the periosteum of the bone and in the meninges 
of the brain and cord are most conveniently classified under the organic

ing of rubber balloons which can then be filled with warm or 
cold water, by the stimulation of structures during operations, 
and by conditioned reflex methods. 
Organic Stimuli—Notwithstanding the lack of complex 
language habits connected with organic impulses, one can see the 
result of their functioning in the clearest manner: in thirst, which 
is initiated by dryness of the soft palate; in hunger, initiated by 
the rhythmical muscular contractions of the stomach; in defe- 
cation, initiated by the pressure of the feces upon the muscular 
walls of the large intestine; in micturition, initiated by the pres- 
sure of the urine upon the sphincters of the bladder; in sex 
activity, initiated, in part at least, by the pressure of the seminal 
fluid; in the pain reflexes due to internal pressure, infections, 
ete.; in hiccoughing, vomiting, ete., the stimuli to which are 
varied. As long as the organic impulses are normally aroused 
and the vegetative reflexes occur in an orderly way, the individual 
is said to have a good organic tone. 
Many of the activities initiated by organic impulses are 
rhythmical in function, such as the heart-beat, respiration, hun- 
ger, the eliminative functions and sex activity. We see in the 
organic reflexes a possible basis for a time ‘‘sense.’’ In highly 
complex animal communities one animal will do a definite thing, 
such as go for food, spell his mate upon the nest, at fairly regu- 
lar intervals. The same mechanisms are functioning in man 
when, fairly regularly even in the absence of a watch but guided 
by the rhythmical contractions of the stomach muscles, he drops 
his occupation and goes for food. The human being is more de- 
pendent upon these rhythms than he usually admits. Students 
become restless if held over the hour; guests become troublesome 
and distrait if dinner is delayed too long beyond their customary 
hour of dining; infants taught to feed at two-hour intervals 
awaken almost on the moment and ery lustily if food is not 
forthcoming. 
The glands, so far as location is concerned, belong to the 
area in which organic impulses arise. That afferent or sensory 
nerves end in the glands is reasonably certain, but what the func- 
tion of such impulses is does not seem to be known. They are
-P-A-G-E-81
  THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 67 
possibly regulatory of the gland itself. Under the influence of 
autonomic motor impulses, the glands secrete, but these secre- 
tions have a wide general distribution. Such secretions and 
their functions are discussed in detail further on. 
V. Sense or Taste. 
Area.—The sense of taste as a whole has been very well 
worked out, thanks largely to the work of Kiesow. The bodily 
areas sensitive to taste are much larger than is generally sup- 
posed, and relatively much larger in children than in adults. 
The taste buds, which are the organs of taste, are found dis- 
tributed fairly densely over the tip, 
sides and edges of the tongue. The 
median part of the dorsum of the 
tongue is lacking in taste buds in 
adults. The portion of the palate 
that lies above the uvula contains { 
these structures, as do the anterior 
pillars of the fauces. Some are 
found in a portion of the posterior 
wall of the pharynx and in a portion 
of the epiglottis and of the larynx. 
They are lacking in the lips, hard __ fia, 9.—Taste bud from the side a wall of the circumvallate papilla of the 
palate, uvula, tonsils, cheeks and tongue: a, taste pore; 6, nerve fiber

the gums. 
Organs of Taste.—Each taste bud (Fig. 9) consists of a large 
number of modified epithelial cells constituting a pear-shaped 
organ 73p to 81p in height and about 40 in width. In addition 
to the sensory cells supporting cells are present. Each sensory 
cell is supplied with taste hairs. The whole structure is beaker or 
barrel shaped. A small pore, opening directly upon the surface, 
serves for the reception of the taste solutions. The nerve fibers 
are distributed directly to the taste buds. While the buds are the 
true organs of taste (corresponding to the hairs and corpuscles 
in the skin) one rarely finds them isolated upon the surface of 
the tongue, but grouped together around a so-called papilla. We

Fig. 10 shows the tongue and its papille. With the exception 
of the 7 to 12 large cireumvallate papille at the base of the tongue 
forming the lingual V, the only other form of papilla having a 
taste function is the fungiform. The latter are extremely numer- 
ous as can be verified by drying the tongue with a linen cloth 
  Fra, 10.—Papillary surface of the tongue. 1, Circumvallate papille forming the lingual V. 3, the fungiform papillw; 4, filiform papille. (Modified from Sappey.) 
and observing them in a mirror. The fine filiform and conical 
papillz serve merely to roughen the tongue for the better manip- 
ulation of food objects. About 400 taste buds lie in each of the 
cireumvallate papilla, while a variable but much smaller number 
are attached to the fungiform. 
It must be remembered that the tongue and oral cavity com- 
prise not only a taste organ, but a cutaneous and kinesthetic area 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 69 
  as well. Furthermore, taste as a whole functions in close con- 
nection with smell; consequently care must be exerted in making 
tests upon taste. In general the test fluids must be warmed to 
body temperature; they must be weak enough to avoid causing 
reflex tongue movement which would involve kinesthetic factors; 
the nose must be tightly plugged up; finally, the individual pa- 
pilla must be stimulated by the fluid in such a way that the stim- 
ulus cannot spread and thereby arouse contact impulses. The 
fluid can best be applied by the use of a small camel’s-hair brush. 
‘When these precautions have been taken it is generally agreed 
that there are four separate sense organs: one responsive to sweet 
substances, one to bitter, one to salt and one to acid. Experi- 
menters in the field of taste have used the conditioned reflex 
method, but more largely the verbal report method. 
When the tongue as a whole is investigated it is found that 
sensitivity to sweet substances is greatest at the tip and least at 
the base. The maximum sensitivity to bitter substances is in 
the region of the circumvallate papille. Sensitivity to acid is 
greatest at the median part of the border. Finally, the sensitivity 
to salt is maximal at the apex and margin and minimal at the 
base. Apparently’ the stimuli to the taste buds have to be ade- 
quate. The mechanical arousal of the taste bud by electrical, 
thermal and contact stimuli has not been confirmed. An ade- 
quate stimulus is afforded when the underneath portion of the 
tongue is smartly tapped. The subject reports the presence of 
the stimulus of salt. This is due to the sudden pressure on the 
capillaries and the consequent release of small quantities of 
their contents. 
The individual taste bud cannot be stimulated like the cold 
and warm spots, but if a large group of papilli is gone over with 
the four taste stimuli, it is found that not all of them react to 
the four solutions. Kiesow examined carefully 39 papille. Four 
were insensitive to all four substances, the other 35 reacted 
as follows:

26 to sweet. .7 to sweet exclusively; 
TBito Aeidee 0s 53.3 3 to acid exclusively;

-P-A-G-E-84
  70 PSYCHOLOGY 
Certain substances have the power of. throwing taste buds out 
of gear. Gymnenic acid when applied to taste buds abolishes first, 
sensitivity of organs to sweet, then to bitter and finally to salt. 
It apparently does not affect the organs sensitive to acid. The 
gymnenic acid has no effect upon the tactile, temperature or pain 
sensibility of the tongue. Cocaine affects the cutaneous sensi- 
tivity of the tongue and finally gustatory sensitivity. 
Some investigation has been undertaken for the purpose of 
obtaining taste contrasts and compensations. Distilled water 
apparently affects the organs sensitive to sweet after weak solu- 
tions of hydrochloric acid, caustic soda or potassium chloride 
have been used in the mouth. The use of a solution of sodium 
chloride and quinine apparently sensitizes the organs responsive 
to sweet substances to such an extent that a subliminal sugar solu- 
tion will produce a reaction. There is no good evidence at present 
for asserting that the presence of one taste solution will neutralize 
the effects of the others. 
Many experiments have been undertaken for the purpose of 
discovering what peculiar chemical property substances must 
possess before they can serve as adequate taste stimuli. So far 
dependable results have not been obtained. ~ 
VI. Ouractory SENSE. 
‘Area.—The area comprising the olfactory sense proper is very 
small. It consists of a small saddle-shaped membrane lining the 
roof and sides of each nasal cavity. The total area (right and 
left) sensitive to olfactory stimuli is about 5 square centimeters. 
Stimuli—The adequate stimuli to the sense of smell are gase- 
ous particles coming into direct contact with the olfactory mem- 
brane. Not all gaseous particles will produce olfactory response. 
The total number which will is unknown, but is very large. Many 
objects, such as arsenic, resins and metals, are non-volatile at 
ordinary temperatures, but they give off particles sufficiently 
fine to affect the end organs when heated. The question as to 
whether solutions containing known olfactory stimuli can arouse 
olfactory reactions when they come into direct contact with the 
olfactory membrane is not so well settled. According to more  
-P-A-G-E-85
    THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 71 
recent. experimentation, it can be asserted that fluids containing 
odoriferous substances brought into direct contact with the olfac- 
tory membrane can serve as adequate stimuli. In making such 
experiments great care has to be exerted to keep bubbles of air 
from excluding the fluid from contact with the membrane. This 
seems to be in line with studies in comparative psychology, since 
it has been shown that certain fish even when blind are stimulated 
by distant food substances. 
The membrane can possibly be stimulated inadequately by an 
electrical current, but there is no general agreement to this. Heat, 
cold and mechanical irritation seem not to affect it. At present 
we can say little about the chemical properties which a substance 
must have in order to affect the olfactory membrane. On the 
physical side, solubility in liquid and in gaseous air seem to be 
correlated with the property of arousing the membrane. Ability 
to arouse the membrane is possibly also to be correlated with the 
coefficient of absorption of heat rays. 
When all has been said we know little about the nature and 
number of adequate olfactory stimuli. The various odoriferous 
substances have been classified with reference to the general 
similarity of response produced by them. This classification, 
which is given below, has little to recommend it: 
Class 1—fruit odors—fruits, wine, ethers, beeswax; 
Class 2—aromatic odors—spices, camphor, cloves, ginger, anise; 
Class 3—flower odors—flowers, vanilla; 
Class 4—musk odors—amber, musk; 
Class 5—leek odors—chlorine, iodine, hydrogen carbide, asafoetida; 
Class 6—burned odors—roast coffee, tobacco smoke, creosote; 
Class 7—hircine odors—caproic acid, cheese, sweat; 
Class 8—foul odors—opium, laudanum, bugs; 
Class 9—nauseous odors—carrion flowers, feces. 
The phenomena of fatigue and adaptation are most interesting 
in this field. The student of chemistry or anatomy ceases in a 
short time to react. to the numerous odors surrounding him. Indi- 
viduals in large audiences housed in poorly ventilated rooms be- 
come adapted to the various odors and perfumes. Individuals just 
coming in react strongly to this situation. In the laboratory it is
-P-A-G-E-86
72 PSYCHOLOGY 
  possible to produce with more or less rapidity adaptation to any 
particular olfactory substance. 
The perfumers have learned the art of combining smell stim- 
uli so as to produce what from a reaction standpoint are entirely 
new olfactory stimuli. The olfactory organ is undoubtedly 
peculiar in this respect. The perfumers have worked mainly 
with the first four classes. Experiments in the laboratory show 
that combinations of stimuli can be made in a similar way from 
any of the classes. 
Smell compensation or physiological cancellation of stimuli 
has been sought for in the laboratory. In daily life there seems 
to be such a principle at work. Carbolie acid is used in the 
operating room, balsam of Peru is used to offset the effect of 
iodoform. Creolin is used to counteract the smell in public toilets, 
tar to offset the odor of ozena. Just what the cancellations 
mean physiologically is not known. The fact remains that 
we constantly use one odor to drown the stimulating value of 
another odor. 
One of the most discussed problems in the recent war was the 
question as to how to cancel the smell effect of a lethal gas, or 
to impart to it the smell of a beneficent gas. This was desirable, 
for if the enemy could be induced to leave off his mask for even 
a short time, its deadly effect would have been accomplished 
before the mask could be donned. Zwaardemaker maintains that 
certain smells can be made to cancel completely; that is, the 
stimuli can be introduced in such intensities by means of an 
olfactometer that no smell reaction can be obtained. He main- 
tains that the following cancel when the intensity relations are 
properly adjusted : cedar wood and rubber; benzoin and rubber; 
paraffin and rubber ; rubber and wax; rubber and balsam of tolu; 
paraffin and wax. Complete cancellations of these kinds are so 
infrequently met with in nature that they play little réle in 
the normal life of man. 
The Smell Sense in Conjunction with Touch and Tempera- 
ture.—It is well to remember that. many taste stimuli are at the 
same time smell stimuli. All of the delicate differential reac- 
tions that the human makes to wines, meats and viands of any
-P-A-G-E-87
THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 73 
kind are made largely on the basis of the olfactory sense. Fur- 
thermore, cutaneous nerves are distributed to the nasal cavities 
and actually to the olfactory membrane itself. Even the anosmic 
reacts strongly to ammonia, ethers and many other substances 
when they are placed in the respiratory field. Hence we must 
consider that in many if not all cases a so-called olfactory stim- 
ulus is at the same time a tactual, or even a tactual and kin- 
wsthetic stimulus.

  the olfactory area is quite small. It is situated at the top of the 
nasal cavity with extension on the sides. It is out of the way of 
the regular respiratory tract or breathing passages. The streams 
of inspired and expired air pass just beneath it in both inspiration 
and expiration. No odoriferous substance will produce an olfac- 
tory response if the subject is prevented from breathing it. Or 
put it another way: in order to produce an olfactory response, 
the odoriferous substance must be placed in the field from which 
the air is inspired. It is generally supposed that gaseous particles 
are given off from the stream of inspired or expired air which

11 shows in a general way the location of the membrane and its 
relation to the nasal cavity as a whole. 
The structure of the individual olfactory elements in the mem- 
brane is rather different from that found in the sense organs in 
the skin. In the skin we find the nerve fibers ending around 
highly modified epithelial cells, the sense organ itself beirig this 
modified, non-nervous structure. Fig. 12 shows the olfactory cell 
or individual sense organ. The cell body is bipolar and lies in

  VII. Avupition. 
The Physical Side of Hearing.—Before entering upon the 
nature of auditory stimulation and the reactions such stimula- 
tions call forth, we may profitably glance for a moment at the 
physical nature of sounding bodies. We find first that some 
elastic bodies such as steel bars and tuning forks impart to the 
air when struck a simple pendular or sinusoidal wave motion, 
equally spaced waves of condensation and rarefaction. Depend- 
ing upon the length and the structure of such elastic bodies, and 
the energy with which they are actuated, we may have waves 
varying in frequency or length and in amplitude through a very 
wide range. Most elastic bodies, those, for example, used in 
musical instruments such as the string, vibrate when actuated 
not only as a whole but in parts as well. The wave motion im- 
parted to the air by such bodies becomes very complex. In such 
cases we speak usually of the lowest vibration rate given out by 
the body as its fundamental vibration (or note) and of the other 
frequencies as its partials. If we have a string vibrating as a 
whole 100 times per second, experiment will show that it vibrates 
in one-half its length one-third, one-fourth and orie-fifth, ete., at 
the same time; so that a stretched string when plucked really 
gives a very complex stimulation. A large bank of resonators 
arranged so that each unit will signal when its particular fre- 
queney appears, as a component part of a complex wave enables 
us to record the total set of vibrations which any given musical 
instrument will give out when any particular note is struck upon 
it. By this means it is possible to state with some degree of accu- 
racy the different sets of frequencies set up by two human voices 
sounding the same musical note. Keyed and fretted instruments 
differ greatly as regards the complex of vibration rates which 
they give out. This is the reason why our reactions are different, 
for example, when middle C is struck on the piano, the flute, the 
organ or the cornet; they all have the same fundamental vibra- 
tions, but they vary enough in their partials for us to learn to 
react differently to them. We can name the instrument from 
which it comes, or make one type of reaction to it when it appears 
on the piano and another type when it appears on the violin.  
-P-A-G-E-90
76 PSYCHOLOGY 
  Such stimuli we call tonal. Attention is called to the fact that a 
simple tonal stimulus, such, for example, as would be offered by 
a note of 512 d.v. on the tuning fork, could differ in amplitude 
and in duration, but not in frequency. All tonal stimuli, how- 
ever, in daily life are complex, and the stimulus as a whole in- 
duces the reaction. The farmer drops work and goes to his food 
when the dinner horn blows; the mother gets up at night when 
her baby eries. Only in the laboratories and in the science of 
music are tonal stimuli controlled in the way we treat them below. 
A very different type of vibration from those described above 
is set up by the tearing of paper or by the dragging of a chair 
along the floor. Here the elastic bodies do not impart an orderly 
timed disturbance to the air particles, nor do the tonal constitu- 
ents, which are undoubtedly present, endure oftentimes for more 
than a fraction of a second. The physical tracings of the air 
waves set up by such stimuli lack periodicity and regularity. 
Such bodies are said to give out aperiodic vibrations. We can 
conveniently group all such stimuli under the general term 
noise stimuli. 
The Adequate Stimulus to Auditory Response.—The ade- 
quate stimulus for the excitation of the ear is ordinarily the air 
wave set up by the vibrations of elastic bodies such as a stretched 
string, a tuning fork or the human voice. In addition to the air 
waves which produce their effect upon the fluids of the inner 
-ear by means of the chain of ossicles to be described below, the 
bones of the skull when placed in direct contact with the sound- 
ing body can also transmit the vibrations to the fluids and can 
arouse an auditory reaction. This can be tested by actuating a 
tuning fork and placing it between the teeth of the subject. We 
shall for reasons mentioned further on state that it is best to say 
that the stimulus to an auditory reaction is a wave motion (how- 
ever produced) in the fluids of the inner ear. In general we may 
say that such a motion may be imparted to this fluid by (1) air 
waves generated by the to and fro movement of elastic bodies, 
(2) by conduction through the bones, (3) by spasmodic or reflex 
movements of the tensor tympani and by the stapedius muscles— 
two small muscles belonging to the middle ear structure, and (4)
-P-A-G-E-91
THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 7 
   possibly through congestion of any of the membranes of the ear, 
and (5) possibly through the clicking of the bones of the middle 
ear as discussed below in Helmholtz’s theory of combination tones. 
Beats.—Two forks having related frequencies, for example. 
one of 512 d.v. and the other.511d.vj, when struck simultaneously 
offer a peculiar type of auditory stimulation. There is first a 
slow increase in the intensity of the stimulus, then a decrease in 
the intensity followed once each second by a momentary period 
of total absence of stimulation (this absence of stimulation is 
theoretical, since even though the two fundamental notes are in 
opposite phase and hence cancelled, the upper partials are not 
cancelled). The ear becomes very sensitive to such fluctuations 
in intensity. When the beats become very rapid they arouse 
antagonistic or avoiding reactions which appear when a per- 
former plays a mistuned interval.® 
Reactions to Tonal Stimuli—If we investigate the behavior 
of any individual when stimulated by simple periodic vibrations 
such as are afforded by a large set of tuning forks, we find that 
sensitivity to this form of stimulation begins at approximately 
40 single vibrations per second and ends at 40,000. We often 
find this range shortened at one or both ends. With advancing 
age, the range is almost always shortened at the upper end. We 
find, furthermore, great sensitivity to even slight differences in 
vibration frequencies. If one sets up a conditioned reflex (page 
35) to the tone 512 d.v., any tone slightly greater or less will set 
off the reflex; but after training one finds that the tone 515 d.v. 
will not set it off, nor will one of 509 d.v. arouse it. By decreas- 
ing the vibration difference we can approach the differential 
threshold (DL). It has been affirmed that the differential 
threshold obtained by the conditioned reflex method does not 
differ markedly from that obtained by the verbal report method 
(we have not yet confirmed this). By the latter method a differ- 
ence of less than one-third of a vibration has been reported. This 
value, however, depends greatly upon what region in the scale we 
  
"It will be noted that so far as a mathematical calculation is concerned, 
the formula for determining the frequency of beats is the same as that for 
determining the difference tones, page 78.

  are working with. With musically untrained individuals the 
difference is very much greater, and with the so-called tone-deaf 
it is very much greater still. Occasionally upon making investiga- 
tions upon individuals with defective hearing one finds that they 
cannot respond to a given tone or group of neighboring tones, 
but that they respond normally to vibration rates of greater or 
less frequency. 
Combination Tones.—One of the remarkable things noticed 
when a subject is stimulated by two simple (‘‘pure’’) tones simul- 
taneously is the fact that he responds really to three tones (or 
more). If the tone of 1328 dv. and the tone 1024 d.v. are 
sounded in the ear of an individual and he is asked to strike 
the forks which have been used in the stimulus, he will strike 
not only 1328 and 1024 but 304 as well, the ‘‘difference’’ tone. 
If he is musically trained, he may strike several others, for 
example, 720, 416, ete. There is a general law which shows these 
relations. If we let w stand for the highest frequency and J 
stand for the lowest frequency and D be used to designate the 
frequency which is not physically demonstrable, then 
D, the first difference tone u— 1=304 
D, the second difference tone 2 I— u=720 
D, the third difference tone 3 I—2u=416, ete. 
Some investigators have reported another type of tone appearing 
in the stimulus complex, namely the so-called summation tone 
whose frequency with reference to the two primary or generating 
tones is w+ 1. It is doubtful whether this tone is present. 
Theory of Origin of Combination Tones.—Just how do these 
tones arise? Helmholtz believed that. when the middle ear is 
forced to respond to two primary tones simultaneously there is an 
asymmetrical movement of the ossicles resulting in a click which 
can be shown mathematically to have the frequencies called for 
in the observed facts. This periodic clicking of the bones be- 
comes a part of the combined wave motion imparted to the fluids 
of the inner ear. Thus, although there is no elastic outside body 
(or may not be) vibrating with the frequencies corresponding to 
the combination tones, nevertheless such waves are imparted to 
the middle ear. We shall find a similar case when we study the
-P-A-G-E-93
  YHE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 79 
eye: there the sense organ itself when stimulated in a certain way 
contributes a part of the stimulus which finally acts upon the 
sensory nerve endings (simultaneous contrast, page 127). 
Reactions to Noise Stimuli—The various reactions to noise 
stimuli have not received any great amount of study. Any tonal 
stimulus interrupted before two complete vibrations have been 
transmitted to the fluids of the ear is reacted to as a noise. Popu- 
lar language contains many words characterizing noise stimuli 
such as hiss, murmur, sigh, boom, bang, rumble, crash, ete. It is 
probable that noise stimuli are more potent arousers of emotional 
reaction than are tonal stimuli (page 219). Phylogenetically at 
any rate, sensitivity to differences in vibration frequency comes 
very late. We know from every-day life that noises have a tre- 
mendous significance in human behavior and that complicated 
reaction systems develop around noise stimuli. This is shown 
most clearly in the avoiding of automobiles and cars. Echoes 
and other sound reflections play a part in our responses, especially 
when vision is cut off. A great many stories have been written 
around blind detectives, and while the portrayed behavior is 
exaggerated, it is not without some foundation in fact. A mother 
has not the slightest difficulty after the first few days in approach- 
ing in the dark her own crying infant and picking it out from a 
large number of other erying children in the nursery. Differen- 
tial sensitivity as well as liminal sensitivity grow very acute when 
an individual’s occupation demands that he react to a world of 
noises. We cite the examples of the hunter who can by their 
eries name the various animals in the forest, and the Indian’s 
delicate attunement and sensitivity to the slightest noise. Noises 
are the stimuli which are most important in daily life. Tonal 
stimuli are of significance mainly in the realm of music.

Structure of the External Ear—We have already discussea 
on page 61 part of the inner ear, namely the vestibular por- 
tion consisting of the semicircular canals and of the saccule and 
utricle. The remaining part of the ear, the cochlea, is devoted 
to the reception of auditory stimuli.
-P-A-G-E-94
  80 PSYCHOLOGY 
  The structure of a large part of the ear as a whole need not 
here detain us since several good descriptions are to be found in 
the various anatomical and physiological text-books. In general, 
one speaks of (1) the external ear, (2) the middle ear, which 
consists of the drum membrane attached obliquely at the end of 
the auditory meatus and of the ossicles with their muscles, (3) 
the inner ear. 
The external ear in man is quite complicated in shape. Its 
general function in the animal world is to collect and condense 
the sound waves. In view of its shape in man, of its method of 
attachment, and the atrophied condition of its muscles, it has 
little funetion in hearing. The canal or external meatus which 
extends from the concha to the middle ear serves as an avenue for 
the conveyance of air vibrations. It is about 22 mm. in length 
and its course is somewhat tortuous. The bore varies consider- 
ably. The skin which lines it is provided with hairs and wax- 
secreting glands. The hairs and wax protect the middle and 
inner ear. 
The Middle Ear.—The middle ear, or tympanum, is an ir- 
regular chamber in the temporal bone. Its outer wall consists of 
the membrana tympani, or drum membrane. The drum mem- 
brane is ellipsoid in form, tightly stretched, and has a diameter 
of about 10 mm. It is about 1 mm. thick and is composed of 
radial and annular fibers. It is stretched over the meatus in 
such a way that it presents a convex surface towards this open- 
ing. In the inner wall of the tympanic cavity which separates 
the middle ear cavity from the inner ear are situated two open- 
ings or windows, the fenestra ovalis and the fenestra rotunda, 
which are to be described. The tympanic cavity communicates 
with the buccal cavity by means of the eustachian tube. An 
irregular chain of bones is stretched between the drum mem- 
brane and the membrane covering the fenestra ovalis. The chain 
of bones consists of the malleus, the incus and the stapes. Fig. 13 
Shows the method of articulation of the bones as well as their 
general form. The handle of the malleus is attached to the drum 
membrane. The head of the malleus (Mep) articulates with the 
saddle-shaped depression in the incus. <A short process of the
-P-A-G-E-95
THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 81 
ineus (Ib) is attached by a ligament to the posterior wall of the 
tympanum. Its long process (Il) articulates with the stapes. 
The stapes is attached at its stirrup-like end to the fenestra ovalis. 
These bones are under the control of two muscles, (a) the 
tensor tympani, which, when contracted, serves to tighten the 
drum membrane, and (b) the stapedius, which, when contracted, 
pulls the stapes slightly away from the fenestra ovalis, thus les- 
sening the tension on the whole system (and hence on the drum 
membrane). The stapedius may 
thus be looked upon as the antago- 
nist of the tensor tympani. When 
the air waves impinge upon the drum 
membrane, it is thrown, into a back- 
ward and forward motion, forward 
at the condensation phase; backward 
upon the rarefaction phase. The 
frequency is thus the same as that of 
the elastic or sounding body. This 
excursion system of the drum mem- Mn. Sgt Fra. 13.—The b f the middl brane is wide but not powerful. The car. i. the Tuallouseatoes tEoleade - os .

able of overcoming strong resistance, which is necessary because of 
the fact that the wave motion must be transmitted by the stapes 
to the fluids of the inner ear. While the importance of the 
middle ear as a transmitting and reinforcing device must be 
admitted, it should be added that in pathological cases auditory 
sensitivity is acute in the total absence of the drum membrane 
and all ossicles. 
The Inner Ear, or Cochlea.—The auditory portion of the 
inner ear, the cochlea, is shown in Fig. 8, together with its relation 
to the vestibule and to the semicircular canals. The cochlea is 
a spiral tube divided into two chambers partially by means of a 
bony shelf, the lamina spiralis, and partly by a membrane, mem- 
brana spiralis, which is attached to the shelf at one end and to

the inner surface of the bony tube at the other. The upper cham- 
ber, or scala vestibuli, opens into the vestibule, while the lower 
chamber, or scala tympani, communicates with the tympanic 
cavity of the middle ear by the fenestra rotunda. At the apex 
of the cochlea the two divisions communicate with each other by

a small opening, the heliocotrema. Between the two scale is a 
small canal, triangular in cross section, called the ductus coch- 
learis. This is the membranous sac continuous with that of the 
vestibule. It contains the endolymph, whereas the scala vestibuli 
and the scala tympani are filled with perilymph. The sides of this 
triangular sac are made up as follows: the bony shelf and the 
membrana spiralis form one side, another is formed by the mem- 
brane lining the bony wall, and the third by the delicate mem- 
brane of Reissner. These relations are shown clearly in Fig. 14.
-P-A-G-E-97
THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 83 
It is in this membranous sac throughout its spiral course that we 
find the true auditory sense organs. These are supported on the 
membrana spiralis (also called basilar membrane in many of the 
texts). The center of the cochlea as a whole consists of a spongy 
bone, the modiolus. The nerve fibers of the VIII, or auditory 
nerve, pass through the bone and are distributed to the auditory 
structures lying on the basilar membrane. The auditory appa- 
ratus in the narrow sense consists of a group of structures called 
the organ of Corti (Fig. 15). To understand this organ and the

Helmholtz resonance theory of auditory stimulation, we must 
glance for a moment at the structure of the basilar membrane. 
As may be inferred, this is a spiral membrane about 0.041 mm. 
across at the base of the cochlea, and about 12 times wider 
(0.495 mm.) at the apex. If we were to detach the membrane 
and flatten it out, it would appear something like the stretched 
string system of the piano in miniature. While there are straight 
elastic fibers in this membrane, it must be admitted that as a 
whole it is largely homogeneous and that these elastic fibers are 
not free to vibrate. On the surface of this membrane super-
-P-A-G-E-98
84 PSYCHOLOGY 
  imposed upon the elastic fibers, one finds at close intervals pairs 
of stiff rod-like cells forming an arch. The upper ends of the 
cells join, while the lower ends are set wide apart upon the basilar 
membrane. There is thus formed a continuous row of the so- 
called arches of Corti. These arches support a series of modified 
epithelial cells, a single row on the inner side of the inner rod 
of Corti, and four rows beyond the outer rod of Corti. These 
cells are supplied with fine, stiff bristles which pierce through 
a fine cuticular membrane (lamina reticularis) and project out 
into the endolymph. There are several other supporting cells in 
the organ of Corti, but they are not important in this connection ; 
since the hair cells are the true sense structures, and it is around 
them that the fibers of the auditory nerve end. Over the organ 
of Corti, extending as far out as the last row of outer hair cells 
one finds the tectorial membrane now looming rather large in 
the sensory physiology of hearing. One end of this membrane is 
attached approximately at the junction point between the basilar 
membrane and the bony shelf, the other end floats freely in the 
endolymph immediately above the hair cells. It is not generally 
recognized that owing to the position of the ear as a whole, this 
membrane works really in a sagittal and not in a vertical plane. 
Gravity thus has no direct tendency to pull it down upon the 
hair cells. In our opinion it can have no influence upon the gen- 
eration of an auditory impulse, except in so far as it may serve 
as an object against which the hair cells can possibly strike. 
Even this function is probably not a necessary one. 
Theory of Auditory Stimulation.—How is an individual hair 
cell stimulated? Various theories are advanced. The Helmholtz 
theory formerly had the most adherents, but it is gradually losing 
ground. This theory may be stated as follows: When a tuning 
fork of 500 d.v. sounds, the wave is transmitted to the fluid of the 
ear. One of the basilar membrane fibers is attuned to that fre- 
quency. It begins to vibrate sympathetically. As this fiber vi- 
brates, it forces the hairlets of the hair cells to strike (possibly) 
against the tectorial membrane. This impact is sufficient to start 
the chemical processes in the hair cell as a whole, which results in 
the arousal of a neural impulse in the nerve element connected
-P-A-G-E-99
THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 85 
  with that cell. On purely logical grounds this theory accounts 
very well for the various phenomena of hearing as follows: (1) 
for the ability of the human being and lower animals to react 
differently to different vibration frequencies; (2) for the ab- 
sence of ability to react to frequencies less than 40 v.s. and 
greater than 40,000 v.s. The theory merely assumes that there 
are no basilar membrane fibers of sufficient length or shortness 
to respond sympathetically to rates of greater or less frequency ; 
(3) the complete inability to react to auditory stimulation, and 
(4) inability to respond to one definite set of frequencies while 
having the ability to respond to higher and lower frequencies 
(tonal islands). 
Objections to the Helmholtz Theory.—Few physicists, how- 
ever, are willing to admit that the radial fibers of the basilar mem- 
brane, forming a part as they do of a homogeneous membrane, 
can vibrate as Helmholtz supposed. Ewald has advanced a 
theory which seems more plausible upon the physical side. He 
assumes that each and every tonal stimulus causes the basilar 
membrane to vibrate in its entire length. Since it subdivides 
into a series of stationary waves of definite form, he calls the 
pattern so impressed upon the membrane the ‘‘acoustic image.’’ 
Every tone would impress a different acoustic image. These 
patterns can be observed if a suitable rubber membrane about 
the size of the basilar membrane is stretched over a frame and 
made to shine with oil. A pattern of stationary waves appears 
on this membrane when viewed under a microscope whenever 
a tuning fork or other elastic body is actuated. Theoretically 
these pressure patterns can account for the phenomena of hearing 
which we have just enumerated if we grant that such patterns 
bear sufficient energy to arouse the auditory hair cells. Luciani 
suggests replacing the basilar membrane of this theory by the 
tectorial membrane. The tectorial membrane under the influ- 
ence of a given pattern would be pressed downward upon a defi- 
nite set of hair cells. We have already called attention to the 
fact that the tectorial membrane does not work in a plane which 
would easily permit this. 
There are many other so-called auditory theories which we
-P-A-G-E-100
86 PSYCHOLOGY 
cannot enter into here. No one theory is accepted by. all in- 
vestigators, but all admit that there must be some mechinism 
in the inner ear capable of performing very complex functions, 
since destruction of the organ of Corti brings in its train the 
inability to respond to noise and tonal stimuli.

such changes may be excited by mechanical irritation, as in the 
case of pressure applied to the eyeball, by an electrical current, 
by an alternating magnetic field about the head, or by direct 
chemical irritation of substances carried in the blood, they are 
ordinarily excited by ether wave motion whose wave-lengths 
and frequencies lie within a restricted range. 
If, as in Fig. 15 A-a, we cause the radiation emitted by the 
lamp S to fall upon a suitable lens L, the latter will form an 
image of the filament of the lamp on the screen AB at O. If 
we place a narrow, slit-like window at O, the rays which are not 
concentrated on the slit will be intercepted by the screen while 
the rest will pass through the slit. If we place a second lens, 
L, and a second sereen, CD at suitable distances from O the lens 
L, will form an image I of O on the screen CD. If as in Fig. 
15 A-b we place a transparent grating G in the path, a part of 
the radiation will pass through unimpeded to the original image 
I. The remainder will suffer interference by the lines on the 
grating and will be diverted or diffracted, some to the 
right and some to the left, in unequal degree, according to 
their wave-length, the greater wave-lengths being diffracted 
more than the shorter ones. As a result, on either side of I 
will be formed a spectrum, which is a series of images (I’u, Te, 
Ts, Ia, 142, 1's, ete.) of O, arranged according to the wave- 
lengths of the lights which compose them. 
The shortest wave-lengths,’ whose images lie nearest the axis 
of the system, do not excite the visual receptors at all. They 
will affect a photographic plate, and they are capable of caus- 
ing certain salts and sugars in the bodily tissues to interact 
with the protein of the latter and cause it to coagulate. Sun- 
burn on the skin is due to this cause and similar injuries to the 
cornea of the eye may be likewise produced under extraordinary 
conditions, as by exposure to electric welding-arcs. These 
wave-lengths form what is called the ultra-violet spectrum. 
Passing through this region from the axis of the system one

next finds a series of colored images of the slit, beginning with 
violet and extending through blue, green, yellow and orange to 
red. This portion is called the visible spectrum. The radiation 
within this range of wave-lengths is called ‘‘ light.’’ 
Beyond the red is another series of images in still greater 
wave-lengths which have no effect on the retina. Their sole 
importance for vision lies in the fact that if their intensity is 
very great they may cause the tears which bathe the eyeball to 
evaporate too rapidly. This region is called the infra- 
red spectrum. 
The shortest wave-lengths which excite the retina are in the 
neighborhood of 400 my and the longest near 760 to 800 my.*

A given light might as well be designated e ieenetieney of vibra- 
tion as by its wave-length, though custom favors the latter mode. Certain 
relations between light stimuli are more readily exhibited when the latter 
are designated by their frequencies. The relationship between wave-length

figure AB represents a visible object. Each point on the object, 
such as A or B, may be regarded as a source of light in that it 
may emit light of itself or may reflect or transmit light which 
passes to it from other light-sources. The radiation from any 
ene point, such as A, travels in straight lines in all directions, 
and it has a wave-length composition and an intensity deter- 
mined, other factors being constant, by the physical characteris- 
ties of A. A limited part of this radiation may be intercepted 
by a surface A’B’. If we imagine the surface A’B’ to represent 
a portion of the light-sensitive retina of the eye we can see that 
it would be stimulated by the radiation from A, if the following 
conditions were fulfilled : 
(1) Some of the intercepted radiation must lie within the 
wave-length range between 400 mp and 800 mp. 
(2) The intensity within this range must exceed a 
certain minimum. 
(3) The duration of the illumination must exceed a 
certain minimum. 
(4) The area on which the radiation falls must exceed a cer- 
tain minimum. 
The receiving surface A’B’ being directly exposed to the 
radiation from AB, it can be seen that light from A passes not 
only to A’ but also to B’ and to all the intervening points. 
Within certain limits of dimensions of AB and A’B’ and of 
their separation from each other, each point between A’ and B’ 
receives practically equal illumination from A. 
Similarly every point between B’ and A’ also receives 
light from B, and the total illumination upon it is the sum of 
that received from A, and from B and from the intervening 
points on AB. Subject to the limitation mentioned above every 
point between A’ and B’ would receive equal illumination. 
Now, if the retina of the eye were directly exposed, as is the 
receiving surface A’B’ (and as is the rudimentary eye in some 
simpler organisms) every part of it would receive equal stimu- 
lation. In such a case responses could conceivably be made 
(1) to temporal changes in wave-length of the light; (2) to 
temporal changes in intensity of the light; (8) to temporal 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
90 PSYCHOLOGY 
  changes in duration of the light; and possibly (4) to changes 
in direction of the light. It would be impossible, however, for 
the organism to respond to differences in the spatial distribution 
of wave-lengths and intensities among the various parts of the 
surface AB since such differences could not be made to exist 
without an additional mechanism. 
Let us suppose, however, that as in Fig. 15 B-b a suitable lens 
is placed between AB and A’B’ at suitable distances from each. 
This lens serves to refract the rays coming from A so that they 
meet at the point A’ thus forming an image of the point A. 
A similar image would be formed of B at the point B’ and 
likewise images of the points betweén A and B would be formed 
between B’ and A’, and in corresponding points. If these 
images were perfect the light at every point in the image B’A’ 
would have exactly the same wave-length composition and the 
same relative intensity as when it left the corresponding point 
in the object. : 
Such a condition is approximated in the eye. (Fig. 15 B-c.) 
The anterior chamber, filled with water, and bounded in front 
by the transparent curved surface of the. cornea; the ecrys- 
talline lens; and finally the posterior chamber filled with water, 
together form a compound lens system which produces more or 
less accurate images of visible objects on the light-sensitive 
retina and thus subjects the latter to a pattern of stimulation 
corresponding to the lightgiving characteristics of the various 
points of the surfaces which send the light to the eye. In order 
that two adjacent portions of a visible object be distinguish- 
able it is necessary (1) that their images lie on different light- 
sensitive elements (cf. p. 119) in the retina; and (2) that the 
lights composing their images shall differ to a certain degree 
in wave-length composition, in intensity or in both; or, if con- 
dition (2) be not fulfilled that the retinal elements on which 
the images fall shall be unequally sensitive. 
Inspection of Fig 15 A-b will make it clear that if one place 
in either of the spectra an opaque slide containing a slit-window 
which is parallel to the slit O, a limited range of wave-lengths, 
depending on the widths of the slits, can be allowed to pass.
-P-A-G-E-105
THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 91 
  If the wave-length range of the selected beam is sufficiently 
small the light is said to be homogeneous. It is an easy matter 
to calibrate the instrument so that given the position of the 
selecting slit on an arbitrary scale the wave-length selected is 
known. The instrument is then called a spectrometer. If the 
light selected at the second slit is allowed to fall on a receiving 
surface, which is to be compared with other surfaces, the instru- 
ment becomes a monochromatic illuminator. 
The selected light will not, in fact, be strictly homogeneous, 
owing to multiple reflection and scattering in the lens L,, and 
the grating; but if it is passed through a second system similar 
to the first the stray light can be excluded. This is necessary 
in precise work. 
Dependence of Stimulation on Wave-Length.—The energy 
of ether wave motion varies as the product of the squares 
of the amplitude and frequency of vibration. One of the 
most striking facts in vision is that a given amount of 
radiant power produces a degree of stimulation which depends 
on the wave-length of the beam. The manner of determining 
the dependence of stimulating value on wave-length may be 
readily understood by reference to Fig. 15C. In this figure, the 
square ABCD represents a plaster cube whose sides AB and 
BC are viewed with the observer’s eye at H. The side AB is 
illuminated by homogeneous light selected at a slit placed in 
the spectrum formed by the optical arrangement shown in Fig. 
15A. The side BC (Fig. 15C) is illuminated by a lamp L, whose 
distance from BC is varied by moving it along a track on which 
its carriage rests. The intensity and wave-length composition 
of the light emitted from L, are kept constant and the illumina- 
tion which it produces on BC varies inversely as the square of 
the distance between L, and BC. (The lamp LZ, and the clear 
glass mirror M are for mixing white light with the homogeneous 
beam and are not used in this experiment.) 
A homogeneous beam is allowed to fall on AB and its energy 
is made equal to a certain predetermined value which is kept 
constant whatever the wave-length of the beam may be. (The 
energy may be measured directly, with any one of several types
-P-A-G-E-106
  92 PSYCHOLOGY 
of radiometer, or it may be calculated from the known character- 
istics of the light source and known losses in passing through 
the spectrometer system.) The position of the lamp L, (Fig. 
15 C) is now adjusted until the subject is unable to decide whether 
AB or BC is the brighter. At this point lights forming the 
images of AB and BC on the retina have equal stimulating 
value. A second homogeneous beam is now substituted for the 
first and the procedure is repeated. The relative stimulating 
values of the various wave-lengths may then be computed from 
the different positions of Z,, since they determined the energy 
concentration which produced a stimulating effect equivalent 
to that of the several homogeneous bands. 
  
  Fia. 15 C.—Apparatus for showing the dependence of stimulating value upon the wave- length of the beam. 
An alternative and better method is to keep the lamp L, 
constant as to position and energy-output, ete., and vary the 
energy in the homogeneous beam required to produce a bright- 
ness match between AB and BC. The relative stimulating val- 
ues of the different wave-lengths would then be proportional to 
the reciprocals of their energies. 
If the stimulating values are plotted against wave-length, 
the result is called a lwminosity curve; and each point on it is 
regarded as expressing the relative visibility of the correspond- 
ing wave-length. It is customary to express the visibility of the

differences between the two sets of values are due mainly to 
Purkinje’s effect. 
If we express the energy delivered on a unit on retinal area 
by a homogeneous beam by the symbol £ and its ‘‘ visibility

v, then its effectiveness as a stimulus is expressed by the product

is Hv, and the total effectiveness of the beam is the sum of the 
effectivenesses of each of the wave-lengths or Fy», + E,Qy, 
+ By, ty ete. This summation is expressed by the common 
term brightness. 
If two lights have proportional values of H for every value 
of A throughout the spectrum they are said to be similar. 
Certain important facts follow from what has been said: (1) 
the energies per unit area in two equally bright images are equal 
if the lights composing the images are similar. (2) If two images 
on the retina in similar lights, are unequally bright, their 
energy contents are unequal; and may be compared by determin- 
ing the reduction in energy content which the brighter image 
must suffer to equal the brightness of the other image. (3) 
Conversely, if two equally bright images are formed in dis- 
similar lights the energies per unit area delivered at the 
retina may be unequal; and furthermore (4) the brightness 
of two images formed in dissimilar lights delivering equal 
energies per unit area may be unequal.° 
The ‘‘ visibility factor ’’ for a given wave-length is greatly 
influenced by the intensity and duration of previous stimula- 
tion of the retina. (Some of these effects will be discussed below, 
under the heading ‘‘ adaptation.’’) 
The ‘‘ visibility factor’’ also depends on the absolute 
energy concentration in the image. If the brightness on the

tures (as of steel furnaces) which must be accurately controlled, depends 
on the precision with which the “ visibility factors” have been determined 
for the particular different observer and on the maintenance of the condi- 
tions of observation under which they were determined. 
That this condition requires extreme care should be immediately 
evident: that it is possible of control is apparent from the close agreement 
found between photometric and radiometric determinations in the hands of 
skilled technicians.

one or two millilamberts ° the most effective wave-length lies 
in the region of 556 mp (‘‘ yellow’). If the absolute bright- 
ness is reduced to 0.001 of the original value, the most effective 
wave-length will be found to lie near 518 mp (‘‘ green ’’). This 
inerease in the relative cffectiveness of the shorter waye-lengths 
in feeble illumination is called ‘‘ Purkinje’s phenomenon ”’ after 
its discoverer. It is due to this shift that moonlight, which is 
physically similar to sunlight, appears greenish. 
Differential Responses to Differences in Wave-Length.— 
A normal barnyard fowl can learn to go to a plaster surface 
illuminated with homogeneous light whose wave-lengths lie in 
the neighborhood of 670 mp and avoid it if it is illuminated with 
light of say 520 mp even if the physiological intensities (bright- 
nesses) are made equal for that fowl. A normal human sub- 
ject could respond by naming the first patch ‘‘ red ’’ and the 
second one ‘‘ green.’’ Obviously the mere naming of a wave- 
length region is not a highly differentiated response. 
Suppose we take a plaster cube, such as the one shown in Fig. 
15C and illuminate one side, AB, with homogeneous light of ap- 
proximately 670 mp (‘‘red’’). If the side BC, is illuminated by 
homogeneous light of longer wave-length he cannot make a dif- 
ferential response to the two lights (except on the basis of 
location) as long as their brightnesses are kept equal. If however, 
we illuminate BC with homogeneous light of about 640 my still 
keeping the two brightnesses equal, the subject may declare a 
difference, and call AD a more yellowish red than AB. If we 
change the illumination on AD to light of 650 mp the subject 
may say that AD is not more yellowish than AB half as often 
as he says it is. This difference of 20 mp in wave-length (i.e., 
670 myz—650 mp) represents the minimal effective decrement, 
or ‘‘ lower differential threshold ’’ (DL), for wave-length with 
a standard of 670 mp. : 
As we choose other wave-lengths for the illumination on AB 
  
* A light-source of one candle-power one foot distant from a perfectly 
diffusing surface whose reflection coefficient is 1.0, lends to the surface 
a brightness of 1.077 millilambert. 
   
-P-A-G-E-110
96 PSYCHOLOGY 
and BC we find that the magnitude of the minimal effective 
difference is by no means constant. For example, if AB is 
illuminated with light of 589.6 mz and BC with 589.0 mp, an 
unusually sensitive subject will probably report BC to be ‘‘ less 
reddish ’’ than AB in about 75 per cent. of his judgments. In 
this region his DL for wave-length is approximately 0.6 mp.

  In Fig. 15 E is shown the DL for wave-length plotted against 
the wave-length of the standard field. These data were obtained 
by a better method than the simple one just described. Between 
400 mp and 660 mp Jones found some 128 threshold differences 
in wave-length. 
In “‘ total color-blindness ’’ the subject cannot distinguish
-P-A-G-E-111
THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 97 
between any two homogeneous lights which have been equated 
in brightness for his eye. There is evidence which tends to 
show that the white rat and the rabbit, the cat and the dog are 
totally color-blind, although Smith, who studied the dog’s 
responses, is inclined to draw a different conclusion from 
her data. 
In other forms of ‘‘ color-blindness ’’ the subject can make 
differential responses to differences in wave-length but the 
thresholds are much larger than for the normal observer. 
Differential Responses to Differences in Intensity—If 
two retinal images in ‘‘ similar’’ lights have equal bright- 
nesses the energy delivered on a unit area of the retina is the 
same in the two cases. Consequently the least perceptible 
difference in brightness is determined by the least effective 
difference in energy concentration. If we wish to find the 
least difference in energy concentration which is effective for an 
animal or human subject whose visibility curve is undetermined 
it is essential that the two stimulus lights be ‘‘ similar.’’? This 
ean be accomplished, within negligibly small limits, by careful 
choice of reflecting surfaces and by proper calibration and con- 
trol of the lamps which illuminate them. 
It is often important to measure the differential threshold 
for brightness in the human subject, in order to establish his 
discriminative ability as compared with other individuals in 
the same test, or to study the effect of fatigue, adaptation, 
quality of light, or of drugs on his own visual performance. 
A simple means of making such a test is shown in Fig. 15 F. 
A small piece of white blotting paper, AB, is illuminated by a 
lamp L, at a fixed distance from it and viewed by the observer 
at EZ. A second lamp L, is arranged to slide on a track placed 
at right angles to that occupied by Z,. A piece of thin clear 
plate glass, M, is placed in the path of light so as to reflect a 
part of the radiation from DL, on to AB. A vertical rod R 
(normal to the plane of the paper) is placed in the path so as 
to shade a part of AB from L,. (It is desirable that the lumin- 
ous surface of L, be very small, so as to render the shadow as 
sharp as possible. For this purpose automobile lamps are 
7
-P-A-G-E-112
    98 PSYCHOLOGY 
convenient.) The shadow of & therefore receives illumination 
from L, only, oe the remainder of AB receives light from 
both Z, and L,. If L, is made sufficiently remote from AB the 
brightness which it adds to AB will be ineffective and the shadow 
of R will be invisible. If L, is brought sufficiently near to AB 
its added brightness is effective and the shadow of BR is visible. 
The minimal effective addition of brightness AB, can be found 
by noting the position of L, at which the shadow can be seen 
in 75 per cent. of the total number of trials. The value of AB is 
usually expressed as a fraction of B, the total brightness of the 
sereen. The ratio AB/B expresses the relative difference thres- 
hold for brightness. 
  
  Fre. 15 F.—Apparatus for determining differential threshold for brightness. Li, L2, lamps; 
AB, white screen; M, partially reflecting mirror; R, opaque rod; E, eye of observer. 
If the absolute value of B is varied between limits of 1 mill- 
ilambert and 1000 millilamberts the ratio AB/B is nearly con- 
stant. The fact thus summarized is a special application of 
Weber’s law. For an experienced observer, under favorable 
conditions of vision the differential threshold is of the order of 
0.5 per cent. to 0.8 per cent. within the region within which 
Weber’s law is applicable. As this is about half the whole range 
of uncertainty in making a brightness match it will be seen that 
the uncertainty of a photometric determination under the 
favorable conditions is between 1 per cent. and 2 per cent. in 
the average. 
As will be seen from Fig. 15G the differential threshold AB/B 
increases rapidly as the absolute brightness of the screen is

diminished below a critical value, near 1 millilambert. Pur- 
kinje’s effect is manifested in the different rates of change of 
AB/B for the longer and the shorter wave-length. 
The magnitude of the differential threshold for brightness 
AB/B is a very good index of visual performance in general, 
as any factors that tend to lessen the sensitivity of the eye in 
other respects tend also to increase the threshold. Consequently 
its measurement is often used-to test the effects of many variable 
factors on visual performance.’ 
If the two compared lights are not ‘‘ similar,’’ the bright- 
nesses of their images on the retina are not directly proportional 
to their energy concentration. Consequently two individuals 
with different visibility factors (ef. p. 92) may disagree widely 
in their attempts to equate them. It is almost impossible for 
a single observer to make -a satisfactory brightness-match by 
direct comparison of two homogeneous lights differing widely in 
wave-length and indirect methods are necessary in tiie pho- 
tometry of lights of different colors. 
Effects of Mixing Homogeneous Lights—Complementary 
Lights.—If two lights of appropriate wave-lengths, such as 656 
mp (red) and 492 mp (‘‘ blue-green ’’) are mixed in different 
proportions an observer will match the mixture with a mix- 
ture of (a) homogeneous light having the wave-length of the 
stronger of the two components and (b) ‘‘ white ’’ light (ef. 
p. 97). As the proportions of the red and blue-green are 
varied a value can be found which the subject will match per- 
fectly with ‘‘ white ’’ light without the addition of either the 
red or the blue-green. (If the match is not always perfect at 
this critical value the subject will select a little red to add to 
it as often as he selects the blue-green.) These two lights are 
  
“Tt is commonly supposed that the higher the brightness the better 
one can see. Inspection of Fig. 15-G shows instantly that this law is not 
general. On the contrary, huge increases of the absolute illumination 
beyond a certain critical point have practically no effect on vision if the 
distribution of lighting is unchanged. This fact is often ignored by engi- 
neers in the lighting of offices and factories at considerable monetary cost 
to the employer and great inconvenience to the worker.

said to pe ‘‘ complementary.’’ Other pairs can similarly be 
found, but the wave-length of one component must always 
exceed a value near 566 mp and the wave-length of the other 
must fall short of a value near 493 mp. Priest has shown that 
for the average eye the frequencies of vibration of complement- 
ary lights are simply related, as is shown in the formula 
(530 — f,) (f — 608) = 220, 
in which f, and f, represent the frequencies of vibration of the 
two complementary lights in trillions per second. This rela- 
tionship is shown in Fig 15-H. It will be noted that lights in the 
“ oreen ’’ region, whose wave-lengths lie between 566 mp and 
493 mp (and whose respective frequencies lie between 530 and 
608 vibrations per trillionth of a second) have no complement- 
ary lights in the spectrum. They may be complemented how- 
ever by mixtures of ‘‘red’’ and ‘‘blue’’ in varying proportions. 
Definition of “White” Light—If the brightness of the 
standard ‘‘ white ’’ surface be kept constant the mixture of any 
two complementary lights which match it cannot be dis- 
tinguished from the mixture of any other two complementaries 
which match it. Owing however to Purkinje’s effect, a match 
made at a moderate intensity will not hold when the intensity 
is greatly diminished, or vice versa. Also, if the eye is sub- 
jected to stimulation from a particular monocromatic beam in 
excessive intensity or for an excessively long time, a match 
made under normal conditions ceases to be valid until the dis- 
turbing effect has been overcome. 
In such industries as the manufacture of paints, artists. 
supplies, dyes and textiles, and in the arts of painting, lithog- 
raphy, advertising, stage lighting and camouflage the ability to 
reproduce a dye or paint with accuracy has extreme importance. 
It can be readily seen that since any colored surface can be 
completely matched by a mixture of white light with one or two 
lights taken from the spectrum, it can be adequately reproduced 
if the following data are given: (1) The wave-lengths of the 
homogeneous lights ; (2) the proportion of ‘‘ white ’’ light which 
has to be added; and (3) the brightness of the material as
-P-A-G-E-117
  THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 103 
compared with that of a non-selective reflecting surface when 
the two receive equal illumination from a ‘‘ white ’’ light source. 
If the unmodified radiation from an incandescent source is 
to be a satisfactory standard of ‘‘ white,’’ it must be reacted to 
at moderate brightnesses and by the most representative 
observers as neutral between ‘‘ yellowish ’’ and ‘‘ bluish,’’ or 
at least be reacted to as ‘‘ yellowish ’’ not significantly more 
vften or more seldom than it is reacted to as ‘‘ bluish.’’? Direct 
noon sunlight under favorable conditions almost meets this 
requirement but due to selective losses in passage through the 
earth’s atmosphere, which is continually changing, sunlight 
cannot be used as a constant standard. As everyone. has 
observed, the cooler an incandescent solid is the more deficient 
will its radiation be in the shorter wave-lengths. Years ago, 
H. E. Ives, working from known laws of radiation and from 
assumed standards of ‘‘ visibility ’’ calculated that the above 
standard of ‘‘ white’’ could be obtained from the radiation 
from the interior of a furnace at a temperature of approximately 
5000° absolute. This standard was then impracticable because 
a furnace can hardly be maintained long or controlled accurately 
at so high a temperature. Since ordinary incandescent sources, 
such as heated tungsten wires, carbon cores, ete., melt at tem- 
peratures between 3000° and 3800° absolute, they are reacted to 
as ‘‘ yellowish ’’ and would not suffice alone. Various attempts 
have been made to construct filters for use with such sources 
but the filters were sometimes short-lived and could not be 
reproduced from year to year. Recently Priest has found it 
possible, by passing the radiation from an ordinary source 
through an arrangement of Nicoll prisms and quartz plates, to 
alter the energy wave-length distribution of the transmitted 
light so as to correspond to that of a source whose temperature 
is higher or lower than the one actually used, and to vary this 
distribution at will. By means of such a system he has shown 
that the light which best approximates ‘‘ white ’’ or ‘‘ neutral ’’ 
light is such as would be emitted from a furnace heated to 5200° 
absolute. This temperature value may require some slight 
correction but it is probable that the future standard of 
““ white ’’ for color-specification will be determined in this way. 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  104 PSYCHOLOGY 
Effects of Mixing of Non-Complementary Homogeneous 
«Lights.—Let us suppose that a, b, c and d represent the wave- 
angths of any homogeneous lights either increasing or diminish- 
ng in the order given; a and c, however, being complementaries. 
In general, if a and b are mixed the mixture will be matched by 
a light whose wave-length lies between a and b. The exact wave- 
length of the intermediate light will depend on the relative 
intensities of a and b. In some cases, depending on the prox- 
imity of b to c some white light must be added to b to complete 
the match. If both a and b exceed 540 my the addition of white 
light will be unnecessary. 
If a and d are mixed their mixture cannot be matched by 
a single homogeneous light but can be matched by a mixture of 
two lights taken from near the extremes of the spectrum to which 
a certain proportion of white light may need to be added. The 
proportion will be greater the closer the proximity of d to c. 
In colorimetry the response made to a given light is often 
described in terms of the proportions in which three ‘‘ primary ”’ 
lights must be mixed in order to produce an identical response 
(match). Several triads of primary lights are possible. An 
essential characteristic, however, is that no one of the three can 
be matched by a mixture of the other two. A convenient triad 
consists of (1) a light whose shortest wave-lengths exceed 655 
mp; (2) a light whose wave-length range lies between 518 and 
527 mp; and (3) a light whose wave-length range lies near 
460 mp. These primaries may be designated as R, C™ and B 
respectively. If the three are mixed in suitable proportions the 
mixture is indistinguishable from a ‘‘ neutral ’’ or ‘‘ white ’’ 
light. Any homogeneous light whose wave-length lies between R 
and C ean be matched by a definite proportion of R and C, pro- 
vided a definite amount of B light be added to the homogeneous 
light to complete the match. Any light whose wave-length range 
lies between C and B can likewise be matched by mixtures of 
C and B in definite proportion but a definite amount of R may 
need to be added to the homogeneous light to complete the match. 
  
* The symbol C is used as an abbreviation for “ Chlor.”
-P-A-G-E-119
  THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 105 
A light whose wave-length is shorter than B can be matched by 
a mixture of R and B with the addition of C to the homogeneou., 
light. Lights which complement those between 493 and 56! 
my are matched by mixtures of R and B. 
Differential Responses to Saturation and Purity.—If one 
half of a field, such as the cube in Fig. 15-C is filled with 
homogeneous light taken from the spectrum and the other half 
with a mixture of the same homogeneous light and ‘‘ white ”’ 
light, the brightnesses of the two fields being kept equal, the 
subject can make a differential response when the white light 
comprises somewhat less than 5 per cent. of the mixture. Jones 
has found some twenty just discriminable steps between spectral 
purity and white, the test-field being of medium brightness and 
the duration of exposure only moderately long. 
In general, if the brightness of a monochromatic field is 
very high or very low the subject reacts nearly, and sometimes 
quite, as if the stimulus were neutral or white. 
Similarly as to the effects of duration of exposure. Probably 
every student who has worked in a photographic dark-room 
has observed the effects of continued exposure to light from the 
“‘yuby ’’ lamp. The glass bulb of this lamp transmits only wave- 
lengths longer than about 630 mp and the total radiation trans- 
mitted would be fairly matched by a homogeneous band of 
(say) 660 mp. When the subject first enters the room he may 
describe the various surfaces as ‘‘reds’’ differing only in bright- 
ness. After a half-hour however, he reacts as if they were all 
non-selective reflectors, illuminated by neutral or white light. 
Let us illuminate the two visible surfaces of the cube in 
Fig. 15 F with homogeneous lights of the same wave-length and 
brightness, and then temporarily shade the side BC and require 
the subject to fixate the edge B for 30 sec. to 60 sec. If now we 
restore the original illumination on BC the original match 
will at first be invalid and a considerable amount of ‘‘ white ’’ 
light will need to be added to the homogeneous light on BC to 
restore the match. That is, after prolonged exposure the subject 
reacts as though, the condition of the eye remaining constant, 
the homogeneous liglt had been gradually diluted with white.
-P-A-G-E-120
  106 PSYCHOLOGY 
If we now fill the side AB with homogeneous light leaving 
the side BC dark and require the subject to fixate the edge B 
for 30 sec. to 60 sec. and then suddenly remove the original light 
and in the same instant fill both sides with homogeneous light 
which is complementary to the first, a still more striking effect 
may be noted. The subject will declare the side BC to be 
“paler ’’ than AB and a very considerable amount of white light 
will have to be added to the homogeneous light on AB to effect 
a match at the moment of exposure. In other words the subject 
will respond to the homogeneous light on AB as if it were more 
highly saturated than the light from the spectrum. 
Effects of Simultaneous Contrast.—If we should illuminate 
one side AB of our little cube with homogeneous light and the 
side BC with ‘‘ white ’’ light the subject will describe BC as 
if it were filled with the complementary to the light on AB. 
If the relative brightnesses of the two sides are properly 
adjusted the subject will describe the light on BC which is 
physically ‘‘white’’ as being as fully saturated as the 
homogeneous light on AB. This response to BC will disappear 
instantly the homogeneous light on AB is removed. 
If AB is illuminated by a mixture of homogeneous light and 
white light and BO with a mixture of white light with the 
complementary light to that on AB the subject will describe 
both lights as being highly, if not fully, saturated. This effect 
of contrast is very marked even when the homogeneous compon- 
ent in either mixture is imperceptible when the mixture is pre- 
sented by itself. 
If a surface is illuminated by light from a vacuum tungsten 
lamp and also by sunlight, a shadow cast by the lamp will be 
reacted to as if it were illuminated by light of wave-length of 
approximately 484 my (‘‘ blue ’’), provided the shadow is east 
at a point where the relative illuminations in the two lights are 
appropriate. The reason is that tungsten light, being deficient 
in the shorter wave-lengths, has the stimulating effect of a mix- 
ture of about two parts of light of wave-length 588 my with one 
part of ‘‘ white.’’ Since the shadow receives only ‘‘ white ”’
-P-A-G-E-121
  THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 107 
light, it is reacted to as the complementary of the ‘‘ dominant 
wave-length ’’ (588 my) in the tungsten light. 
A piece of ‘‘ gray ’’ paper laid on a colored surface will be 
reacted to as if it reflected an excess of the complementary to 
the ‘‘ dominant ’’ wave-length reflected by its background. These 
facts have to be observed in painting. An asphalt road depicted 
as alongside a grassy field must be painted in purple. 
If two pieces of the same gray paper are laid on papers of 
higher and lower reflectivity respectively and subjected to equal 
illumination they will be reacted to as if they had very different 
brightnesses, that of the first being the lower. 
In general, if two lights differing in intensity or in wave- 
length stimulate adjacent portions of the retina they tend to 
exert complementary effects. The greater the separation of the 
stimulated areas the less will be the effect. This fact is called 
the law of contrast (literally contra + stare). Different expla- 
nations are offered in different hypotheses of vision but none 
does more than restate the fact in different terms. The effect 
of contrast is universal though often unobserved by the subject. 
Striking demonstrations can be easily arranged with ordinary 
lamps and colored filters. 
Effects of Stimulation of the Peripheral Retina with Homo- 
geneous Lights.—If the eye is held in fixation and an image of a 
small surface is formed in homogeneous light on the peripheral 
retina the subject will react as if the light were ‘‘ white.’’ As 
the image is moved toward the fovea (ef. p. 119) a critical zone 
will be found within which the subject will usually describe the 
light, no longer as ‘‘ white ’’ but as ‘‘ yellow ’’ or ‘‘ blue ’’ 
according as the dominant wave-length is longer or shorter than 
the ‘‘ blue-green ’’ region in the spectrum. As the image is 
moved through this zone still nearer to the fovea its effect will be 
described as if its wave-length had been gradually varied from 
the yellow (or blue) region toward its actual value, and finally 
a paracentral region will be found in which the normal response 
will be made. 
The extents of these zones, measured in terms of angular 
separations from the fovea, vary according to the wave-length, 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
108 PSYCHOLOGY 
  brightness and purity of the stimulating light and also accord- 
ing to the retinal area covered by the image. In general the 
greater the area and brightness, the wave-length composition 
being constant, the wider the normal zone. Abney’s measure- 
ments on the horizontal extent of the normal zone may be 
formulated as follows: If E represents the extent of the normal 
zone in circular degrees from the fovea, and B represents the 
brightness of the image on the retina, and C and K, constants 
whose values are different for different wave-lengths, then for 
stimuli of constant area, H = c.log B +k. That is, for a given 
wave-length and a given area, the horizontal extent of the 
normal zone varies as the logarithm of the brightness of the 
stimulus. The extent of the normal zone depends also on the 
area of the retinal image. It is constant for areas exceeding 5° 
but diminishes according to the logarithm of the reduction of 
area below 5°. 
It has been found that certain wave-lengths can be chosen 
whose normal zones are coextensive and which are reacted to 
as if they were neutral in all parts of the peripheral field outside 
the normal zone. According to Baird these stimuli are: (1) A 
bluish-green of about 490 mz; (2) an extreme red mixed with 
a little blue; (3) a yellow, of about 570 mp; and a blue of about 
460 mp. Stimulus (1) is the complement of (2) and stimulus 
(8) is the complement of (4). These are called ‘‘ stable ’’ 
stimuli and they correspond to the two pairs of ‘‘ primaries ’’ 
selected by Hering. It has been argued by some color-theorists 
that as compared with the central zone the extreme peripheral 
retina is color-blind, and the intermediate dichromatic; but, as 
appears above, the evidence does not support this view. 
Some Temporal Aspects of Visual Response.—If a 
reflecting or transmitting surface is alternately exposed to a 
light source and shaded from it the subject will describe the 
surface as ‘‘ flickering ’’ if the frequency of alternation is 
sufficiently slow. If the frequency be sufficiently increased a 
critical value will be found at which the subject will react as 
if the illumination were steady but reduced in intensity. 
The critical frequency for flicker F,, depends on the bright-
-P-A-G-E-123
  THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 109 
ness of the intermittently viewed surface as appears from the 
formula 
F, =C-logB+k 
in which B represents the absolute brightness of the surface, and 
C and k constants whose values depend on the wave-length of 
the stimulus. For each wave-length the value of the constant ¢ 
has two values: one for brightness below 0.03 millilamberts 
(below which the retinal cones are supposed to cease to respond 
and the rods become active), and the other for brightnesses 
between 0.03 and 100 millilamberts. These facts are of import- 
ance in that they make it possible to compare the brightnesses 
of two surfaces whose colors are so different as to make simul- 
taneous comparison of their brightness very difficult and unre- 
liable. In determining the ‘‘ visibility factor ’’? advantage is 
often taken of this method rather than the method of direct 
comparison described on p. 91. 
It has been established that if two images having the same 
wave-length composition are alternated on the retina at vary- 
ing speeds the flicker-effect will vanish for both at the same 
rate if the two images are equally bright. It is further assumed 
by some investigators that the same law holds when the two 
images have different wave-length compositions as well. On this 
assumption this method (called the method of flicker photom- 
etry) is widely used as a means of equating the brightnesses 
of two fields of different color. The results obtained by this 
method are much more constant than those obtained by the 
method of direct comparison or by the method of critical fre- 
quency; but the results obtained by the three methods do not 
agree perfectly. It will be readily seen that if the assumption 
just mentioned be sound the principle of the flicker photometer 
involves a different law from that established for critical fre- 
quency. One of the ablest exponents of the flicker method, H. BE. 
Ives, indeed asserts that this is the case. As a method of making 
possible the reproduction of stimulus conditions to a high 
approximation to exactness the flicker method has great value 
whether it measures true brightness or not.
-P-A-G-E-124
  110 PSYCHOLOGY 
In general if two or more surfaces of different brightnesses 
are viewed in succession at a rate above the critical frequency 
for flicker, the brightness of the fused images will be the mean 
of the brightness of the several images weighted according to 
their respective durations. This formulation is known as the 
Talbot-Plateau law'® and is of extreme importance. On its 
validity depends the use of the rotating sectored disk as a 
means of reducing the effectiveness of a beam of light to a known 
degree. When extended to include chromatic effects, the law 
also authorizes the use of the ‘‘ color-wheel ’’ in demonstrating 
the laws of color-mixture. 
After-Images.—If a small portion of the retina be stimulated 
by homogeneous light for a short time and then shaded, the 
subject will often behave as if the retina were still being stimu- 
lated either (1) by the original light or (2) by its complement- 
ary. In case (1) the effect is called the positive after-image 
and in case (2) the negative after-image. The two effects can 
be made to alternate by alternately stimulating the eye with 
diffused white light and then removing the stimulus. Under 
suitable conditions these effects may persist for a long time but 
  
* Every-day illustrations of its application may be seen in the moving- 
picture houses; and also in vision under illumination from tungsten lamps 
operated on alternating current. As the direction of the current through 
the lamp is alternated (usually) 60 times a second, the current passes 
through a maximum and also through zero 120 times a second. Thus the 
filament is alternately heated and cooled and the illumination which it 
produces consists of a series of intense flashes separated by intervals of 
relative darkness. The net effect, however, is that of a steady illumination 
whose intensity is the mean of all the instants of the cycle. If one uses 
a lamp whose filament is very fine and therefore cools rapidly, small 
moving objects will be responded to as if they occupied several discrete 
positions at the same time. An electric fan rotating at high speed under 
such illumination will appear to be rotating slowly forward or backward. 
If a given blade occupied exactly the same position at one flash which 
it or another blade occupied at the preceding flash, the fan would appear 
to be stationary. These effects are called stroboscopic. They have been 
utilized in the construction of an interesting instrument called the Lorenz- 
Seashore tonoscope, for demonstrating and measuring the fluctuations of 
pitch of musical tones as produced by different instruments and by singers.
-P-A-G-E-125
  THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 111 
they gradually diminish both in intensity and saturation. They 
are capable however of being revived to an intense degree many 
hours after they have disappeared if the eye is adapted to dark- 
ness. They may have quite a deal to do with the character of 
dreams and so-called ‘‘ mental imagery,’’ and may play an 
important part in hallucinatory experiences. If the original 
stimulus is very intense the after-images may not be simple, 
positive or negative, ones but the subject may behave as if the 
affected area were being successively stimulated by ‘‘ red,’’ 
“* yellow,’’ ‘‘ green,’’ ‘‘ blue ’’ and ‘‘ purple ’’ lights in vary- 
ing orders. ‘i 
' Under ordinary conditions the after-images of one stimulus, 
being superposed on the primary images of succeeding ones, 
serve to modify visual responses unfavorably and to a large 
degree. In such practical problems as the distribution of 
illumination and the selection of wall-papers and paints due 
regard must be paid to the conditions of their production if high 
efficiency of performance is to be had. 
The effectiveness of a photic stimulus is manifestly a function 
of three variables: (1) Its brightness, (2) the area of the retina 
to which it is applied, and (3) its duration. Cobb has shown 
that if (1) be kept constant the product of (2) and (8) is 
constant for threshold effectiveness. If the area be kept con- 
stant, and small, the reciprocal of the duration necessary for 
threshold effectiveness is nearly proportional to the logarithm of 
the brightness between the limits of 1 and 107 millilamberts; 
but the necessary duration is much less than the duration of the 
normal resting period of the eye at a brightness of one mill- 
ilambert. The advantages of the higher brightnesses are 
therefore doubtful. 
Adaptation.—If a subject is brought from a brightly lighted 
room into one that is very feebly lighted he will at first be either 
unable to distinguish objects or else will react only to very large 
objects which present a large difference in brightness from their 
background. After a time, which may vary from a few minutes 
to one or two hours, he will be able to respond to the same objects 
with quickness and certainty. If he is now suddenly brought  
-P-A-G-E-126
  112 PSYCHOLOGY 
into a brightly lighted room he will probably again be unable 
to see clearly and may make efforts to shield the eyes from 
light. After a short time, varying from a few seconds to a few 
minutes, he can again make normal responses. The changes 
which occur under these conditions are called adaptational 
changes and are of capital importance. 
The sensitivity of the normal subject is capable of enormous 
modification. He is capable of making visual responses of some 
sort at general levels of brightness which vary relatively. be- 
tween 1 and 1,000,000,000. Furthermore, responses can be made 
with about equal effectiveness at brightness levels varying 
between 1 and 1000 millilamberts, provided the subject has 
been allowed sufficient time for adaptation. Below the level 
of 1 millilambert the effectiveness of vision begins to fail (cf. 
Fig. 15-G). Thus the practical question of how much light one 
needs to see by is a meaningless question unless the subject’s 
state of adaptation be taken into account. 
Just what determines adaptation is not clearly known. The 
total light admitted to the retina is a function of the area of 
the pupil (ef. p. 117) other conditions being constant. The 
pupil in very dim light tends to dilate to a diameter of about 
8 millimeters. On sudden exposure to a brighter surface it 
usually contracts to a diameter of about 2 millimeters but may 
later assume a larger value. As the areas of the opening are 
proportional to the squares of the diameter it appears that the 
pupil may operate to vary the relative intensity of illumination 
on the retina between the limits of 1 and 16. This, however, is 
almost an insignificant part of the total range of adaptation. 
Some authors have assumed that the photosensitive structures 
in the retina have their sensitivity altered so that they tend 
with adaptation to excite neural impulses with about the same 
frequency under intense and weak stimulation. Some have 
assumed that this action is due to the rate of consumption of a 
sensitizing substance present in the receptors or their surround- 
ing media. This hypothesis however is affected by the fact 
of binocular adaptation. Dunlap has shown that if a restricted 
area in one eye is continuously stimulated until it ceases to  
-P-A-G-E-127
  THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 113 
respond, the ‘‘ corresponding ’’ area (ef. p. 123) in the unex- 
posed eye is likewise affected, and in the same degree. This 
suggests that a central mechanism is essential to the process. 
There are certainly efferent pathways leading to the retina, 
which might make such control possible. 
It has been shown that in certain of the lower vertebrates the 
pigment in the epithelial cells of the retina (which dove-tail 
with the rods and cones) migrates forward under high illumin- 
ation,.and retreats in darkness. On the other hand, under high 
illumination the rods elongate, so that their sensitive portions 
are well shielded by the pigment layer, while the cones contract. 
In darkness the reverse seems to be true. The facts are not 
perfectly consistent, due, perhaps, to shortcomings of the tech- 
nique. Furthermore the exposure of only one eye results in 
similar changes in the shielded eye, thus suggesting a central 
control. These facts tempt one to construct a theory of adapta- 
tion based at least in part on an assumed tendency of the 
epithelial pigment to admit a constant density of illumination 
to the rods and cones. Such an hypothesis is in accord with the 
facts and offers a simple explanation of them, but it suffers from 
the disadvantage that all attempts as yet made to demonstrate 
pigment-migration or contraction of rods and cones in the mam- 
malian eye have failed. There is some probability that this 
failure is due to defective methods of fixing the histological 
preparations but meanwhile the hypothesis can hardly be 
pressed too far. 
Other students have assumed that the rods and cones, by 
their contraction and elongation, may weaken and strengthen 
their synaptic connections with the bipolar cells, so that fewer 
impulses aroused in the former would be transmitted to the 
bipolar cells. Evidence as to this point is completely lacking 
and the view is out of harmony with the belief of eminent neurol- 
ogists in the permanence of physical connections at the synapses. 
Still others have assumed that the frequency of retinal response 
may be the same for strong and weak stimulation but, due to 
the action in inhibitory centers some of the neural impulses 
themselves may be blocked.

114 PSYCHOLOGY 
  According to the duplicity theory, the rods and cones are 
two separate and alternative mechanisms, the former function- 
ing at very low brightness, and the latter at high ones. There 
is a range of brightness within which both rods and cones 
function after a fashion but above and below this range only 
one mechanism is operative. The fovea, which contains only 
cones, is completely blind under dark-adaptation; birds which 
have only cones are helpless in low illuminations; the evidence 
of critical frequency for flicker, ete., all points to. a 
double mechanism. 
Many industrial accidents result from inattention to the 
fact of adaptation. Persons who have to pass from brightly 
lighted rooms to dimly lighted rooms where there is complicated 
machinery, or who, after working on a well lighted part of a 
machine have to look into a dense shadow to operate another 
part, are especially exposed, since the eye cannot be adapted, 
even in tolerable degree, to two widely different levels of bright- 
ness at the same time. 
While it is possible under special conditions to produce local 
adaptation in restricted areas of the retina in practice this 
process seldom proceeds very far on account of eye-movement. 
Everyone has noticed that it is impossible to discern objects in 
a daylight room when one is standing outside the building and 
looking through an open window; the reason being that the 
eye being adapted to the brightness-level of the sun-lit sky, 
clouds, earth, and wall of the building, will not function well 
at the much lower brightness level of the room. On the other 
hand the observer on the outside can distinguish the objects 
with ease at night, when the room is much more dimly illuminated 
by artificial sources, but the observer’s surroundings are rela- 
tively dark. As a rule the brightest surfaces in the principal 
part of the visual field, if they are fairly large, tend to determine 
the state of adaptation of the eye. Hence, it is of great impor- 
tance that the average brightness of the objects under special 
observation be at least as high as any of the other surfaces 
within the field of view. Cobb and Johnson by very different 
methods have independently shown that vision is impaired by
-P-A-G-E-129
  
THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 115 
approximately 20 per cent. by making the surroundings only 
twice as bright as the test object; and the impairment is 
increased to the order of 65 per cent. by making the surround- 
ings ten times as bright as the test field. In some factories the 
workers are required to face diffusing glass windows whose 
brightness may be 100 times as high as that of the work material. 
The result, if the operation requires much of vision, is a tre- 
mendous insult to safety, efficiency and health of the worker. 
Color Theories.—The principle facts of vision have been 
related to as many as 80 different hypotheses invoked to explain 
them. The spatial limits of this book preclude an adequate dis- 
cussion of any of them, and the student is referred to more 
copious works. Perhaps the best general reference at the 
present date is J. H. Parsons: An Introduction to the Study of 
Color Vision (Cambridge, 1915). The hypotheses formulated 
by Helmholtz, by Hering (especially as modified recently by 
E. Q. Adams) and by Christine Ladd-Franklin are the most 
used; that of Ladd-Franklin probably having the most to com- 
mend it. 
SrructTuRE oF THE Eyez. 
Structure of the Eye as a Whole.—The eye as a whole func- 
tions somewhat like a camera. In a camera there is a lens for 
focussing an image upon a sensitive plate, and a diaphragm for 
controlling the intensity of the light. In the eye there is a lens, 
and a similar diaphragm, the iris. The sensitive plate of the 
camera becomes the retina of the eye. In the retina must lie the 
photochemical substances which are assumed to exist. Here 
the analogy stops. The action of the chemical substances in the 
retina ends in a neural impulse which passes through the central 
nervous system and out to an effector organ. Each eye-ball is 
almost spherical. It is made up of concentric coats, modified in 
a special way in certain parts, a crystalline lens and two fluid 
masses—the aqueous and vitreous humors. The lens and fluids 
oceupy the interior of the eye-ball. Fig. 16 shows the more im- 
portant features of the eye as a whole.

THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 117 
Coats of the Eye—(1) The outside coat of the eye is a tough 
fibrous membrane which gives the eye its form. The posterior 
portion of this coat, the sclerotic, is opaque; the anterior portion, 
the cornea, is transparent. (2) The middle coat, the choroid, is 
a black, soft, extensible and easily disrupted membrane. It is 
composed largely of vascular and muscular tissue. The posterior 
portion of the choroid is pigmented ; the middle portion is muscu- 
lar (for the control of the lens), while the anterior portion, the 
iris, is a perforated membranous diaphragm placed just in front 
of the lens and immediately behind the cornea. The opening in 
this diaphragm*is called the pupil. The iris contains connective 
tissue fibers arranged radially to the pupil. Near the margin of 
the pupil there are also smooth muscle fibers which form a sphinc- 
ter muscle. There are also smooth muscle fibers radially dis- 
posed that act antagonistically to the sphincter fibers. The size 
of the pupillary opening is determined by the action of these 
muscles. Strong light falling upon the retina produces relaxa- 
tion in the radial fibers and contraction of the sphincters: the 
pupil grows smaller. When the light is decreased in intensity, or 
removed, the sphincters relax and the radial fibers contract: the 
pupil dilates. 
The Lens and the Ciliary Muscles.—The crystalline lens 
(Fig. 16, 12) is biconvex. It is highly elastic and tends always, 
unless constrained, to become more nearly spherical. It is put 
under restraint by the transparent capsule which surrounds it. 
‘When the eye fixates objects upon the horizon, the lens becomes 
most flattened. When fixating objects at a distance of 14 inches, 
it becomes most nearly spherical. The mechanism which brings 
about the flattening of the lens is the ciliary muscle. The loose 
muscular coat of the choroid in the region of the ciliary muscle 
is firmly attached to the firmer sclerotic. The lens capsule is at- 
tached as shown in Fig. 16. When the eye fixates objects near at 
hand, the ciliary muscle contracts sharply and as the muscle 
pulls up towards the point where the choroid is attached to the 
sclerotic, the tension on the capsule is lessened. The lens, by 
virtue of its own elasticity, becomes more convex. When the 
object is far away, the ciliary muscle relaxes, thus dragging
-P-A-G-E-132
  118 PSYCHOLOGY 
down the lens capsule, greatly increasing the tension. This 
exerts uniform pressure principally upon the anterior surface of 
the lens. The images for near and far objects thus fall accurately 
upon the retina in the emmetropice or normal eye. In a great 
many cases the action of the lens and muscle is not accurate. 
For example, in myopia (near-sightedness) parallel rays of light 
are brought to a focus in front of the retina; in hypermetropia 
(long-sightedness) they are brought to a focus behind the retina. 
These two defects are easily corrected with glasses. Often, too, 
there is a lack of perfectness in the cornea. It may not have the 
same radius of curvature in the upper and lower‘ halves, or in 
the right and left halves. The effect on the path of the light is the 
same as that which would be obtained were the light passed 
through a lens made up by cementing together halves and quar- 
ters of lenses of different foci. In such cases of corneal defect 
no clear, complete image can fall upon the retina. This condi- 
tion is known as astigmatism. 
The Retina—The retina (Fig. 16, 4) is a delicate inner mem- 
brane lining the eye-ball. It is cup-shaped, since it does not invest 
the anterior portion of the eye-ball. It ends near the ciliary 
muscle. Nerve cells lying in the retina send out their processes 
to form the optic tract. This tract pierces the choroid and scle- 
rotic and takes its exit at the posterior pole of the eye-ball. Fig. 
16, 1, gives a view of this relationship. It is usually spoken of 
as the entrance of the optic nerve. It is really the exit of the 
optic tract. The relationship of the nerve elements in the optic 
tract with the other elements in the retina is somewhat compli- 
cated. Indeed, the whole retina is far from simple. For deserip- 
tive purposes it is best to start with the actual receptors or sense 
organs. These are nearest the choroid and hence farthest away 
from the light. The light must pass: through all the other layers 
here described before it can fall upon the receptors. The receptors 
are of two kinds, the rods and the cones. They are shown in 
Fig. 17. The outer segments of both rods and cones are made up 
of shining, doubly refractive substances, which can be split up 
by certain reagents into a series of dises. The inner member of 
both rods and cones is a fine varicose fiber which contains a

nucleus. The inner segments of the 
rods terminate in a rounded swell- 
ing, whereas the cone terminates in 
a swelling which splits up into fine 
processes. It can be seen that the 
cone is probably the more highly 
complex of the two structures, since 
by its branched ending it offers more 
chances for neural connections. We 
have already brought out the fact 
that in the fovea centralis, or spot 
of clearest vision, only cones are 
present. In the regions around the 
fovea there is a one-to-one relation- 
ship between rods and cones. As 
one passes from this region, one finds 
fewer and fewer cones. On the 
periphery only rods are present. 
The rod and cone layer may be called 
the outermost functional layer of the 
retina (that is, it lies next to the 
choroid). As in all other sense 
organs, the receiving structures must 
come in contact with neural struc- 
tures. The rods and cones form no 
exception. The ends of their inner 
processes come into contact with the 
second functional layer of the retina, 
the layer of bipolar neurones (a 
neurone is a nerve cell, with its out- 
growth) (Fig. 17). This layer may 
be looked upon as the true peripheral 
optic nerve, although the neurones 
composing it are only a fraction of a 
mm. in length. The cell bodies in this layer give off at one pole an 
outer process which ends around the terminal processes of the 
inner structures of the rods and cones. At its other pole, it gives 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  120 PSYCHOLOGY 
off a process which ends around the cell bodies that lie on the 
inner surface of the retina (next to the vitreous humor). These 
cell bodies with their processes should be looked upon as the third 
functional layer of the retina. This innermost layer consists of 
fairly large nerve cells, each of which gives off a single fiber which 
passes back to the pole of the eye. This fiber, regardless of the 
position of the cell body giving rise to it, takes a curved radial 
course and joins with all fibers of similar origin to form the optie 
tract. Their further course to the brain is described on page 163. 
Summary.—We find that the light passes through all of the 
transparent structures just described and falls finally upon the 
outer members of the rods and cones. The rods and cones are 
stimulated, that is, some chemical change takes place in them, 
and a neural impulse arises in the nerve elements with which the 
rods and cones are in contact, the bipolar neurones. These 
ueurones arouse in turn impulses in the ganglion cells (neurones 
of the optic tract) with which they are in contact. The impulse 
passes from here to the occipital cortex, then to the motor cortex 
and back to the muscles of the eyes, head, ete. 
Action of Visual Purple.—Probably the most interesting 
physiological phenomenon observable in the eye is the action of 
the visual purple. It has been several times clearly shown that 
the outer members of the rods secrete a purplish-red pigment 
when the eye has not been exposed to light for a considerable 
time (two hours). Under the action of white or monochromatic 
light this purple gradually fades, passing through several changes 
in color, and disappears at the end of fifteen minutes. When first 
discovered it was hoped that a true physiological theory had been 
approached, Ebbinghaus actually formulated a theory of color 
vision in terms of the action of visual purple. In view of the fact 
that it does not appear in cones, the human fovea would thus be 
without any function, as would that of birds and other animals 
whose retin contain only cones. Nor does its assumed function 
as acting as a sensitizer for the rods in darkness adaptation fare 
much better, since many animals whose retin contain only cones
-P-A-G-E-135
  THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 121 
or mainly cones can still dark adapt, therefore the view is forced 
upon us that the true function of the visual purple in the rods 
has not been completely worked out. 
Binocular Vision.—In our discussion of the eye so far, we 
have considered it really as a single organ. But usually the two 
eyes work together. In uniocular vision there is a lack of definite- 
ness and perfectness in reactions to objects at varying distances 
from the eye. If one eye is closed in a normal individual, the 
reactions to objects at a distance are fairly accurate. On the 
other hand, those to objects close at hand are very inaccurate. 
Try this by having some one touch your finger, having one of his 
eyes closed, or thread a needle or appose two sharp-pointed in- 
struments. The adjustments are poorly made. The moment he 
opens the other eye, the acts are accomplished with ease. It 
should be mentioned in this connection that a little practice greatly 
improves this type of adjustment, so that the man born with 
only one eye functional, or who has had one eye removed, is not at 
such a loss as might be supposed from these observations. When 
the two eyes work together, there is (a) a greater extension of 
the total vision field, since a part of the possible field of view 
of any one eye is blocked by the nose. The true binocular field, 
that is, that portion of the total field from which images reflected 
into the eyes fall upon corresponding points, is smaller than the 
sum of the fields of the two eyes; (b) in binocular vision, the 
images falling upon the retina are more complete, since each eye 
contributes certain elements, that is, there are two fixed points 
of view; (c) the response to form, size and distance of' objects 
from the eye are more accurate; (d) defects in the one eye do not 
disturb the adjustments of the subject when both eyes are stim- 
ulated. A reference to the blind spot will simplify this. If only 
one eye is used, it is quite possible that the image of an object 
might fall upon the blind spot. No reflex tendencies would be 
released whereby the eye would be turned so as to receive the 
object upon the fovea; the object would not be reacted to. When 
both eyes are stimulated by an object, it is not possible for the 
image to fall upon the blind spot of both eyes, hence reflex 
tendencies will start in one eye at least and the other eye will be
-P-A-G-E-136
  122 PSYCHOLOGY 
forced to follow. The result will be a perfect focussing of the 
object upon the spot of Sea vision in each eye. 
Muscles of the Eye and Their Action.—The movements of 
the two eyes are controlled by six large striped muscles attached 
to each eye-ball. Their points of attachment are shown in Fig. 18.

The joint action of the medial rectus and of the lateral rectus 
rotates the eye inward and outward. The superior rectus and 
the inferior rectus rotate the eye upward and downward and 
somewhat inward. The inferior oblique and the superior 
oblique rotate the eye outward and upward or outward and 
downward. These are the simple eye movements which result 
from the action of pairs of muscles. In many cases three or more 
muscles are involved and the relationships become very compli-

THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 123 
cated indeed. Attention is called to the fact that the muscular 
system of ‘the eye is at the same time a part of the kinesthetic 
system and indeed an extremely important part. 
Condition for Single Vision Owing to the codrdination and 
balance existing in the eye movements, the two eyes become really 
a binocular instrument. In order to have single vision with both 
eyes functioning, it is necessary that the images of the objects 
fall upon certain points in the two retine which are called ‘‘iden- 
tical or corresponding points.’’ Whenever this happens the sub- 
ject reacts to a single object. In all cases where the images fall 
upon disparate points, diplopia, or double images, results, that is, 
the subject reacts to two objects. Occasionally one of these images 
is so blurred and indistinct that its presence does not very much 
disturb reaction. One can learn, of course, to react to either 
image. This appears quite clearly in the use of a microscope. After 
a little practice the individual becomes monocular in his use of 
the microscope, and the image from the unused eye is ‘‘neg- 
lected.’’? Corresponding points on the retina may be made clear 
by making a paper image of the right retina and one of the left, 
first dividing each into quadrants, and sliding the left model 
into the right without rotating or otherwise disorienting them: 
the corresponding quadrants in the two retin will be super- 
imposed. The upper and lower nasal quadrants of the left eye 
correspond respectively to the upper and lower temporal quad- 
rants of the right eye; the upper and lower temporal quadrants 
of the left eye correspond respectively to the upper and lower 
nasal quadrants of the right eye. The most important corre- 
sponding points are the two fovee. 
, Horopter—In each fixed position of the eye there are a num- 
ber of points in the field of view, images from which will fall upon 
the corresponding points of the two retine. If we plot a figure 
embracing all such points, the figure is called the horopter for 
that position. If a distant point is fixated upon the horizon, the 
two images of the point fall, of course, upon corresponding points, 
namely, upon the fovee. But it is found that even if this fixa- 
tion is held, the images of many other objects above, below, right 
and left, while not falling upon the fovex, fall nevertheless upon

corresponding points in the retine. They are reacted to singly; 
the subject can enumerate them or name them correctly. 
Visual Reactions Involve Habit Systems.—Attention must 
be directed to the fact that in our visual reactions to objects there 
are many complex non-visual factors. In the first place, visual 
reactions are really habit systems visually set off or initiated. 
‘We have in the past not only reacted visually to such objects; 
we have touched them in the dark, handled them, walked toward 
them, away from them, in intense illumination, in shadow and in 
fog, now with the eye in one position, now in another, now with 
one set or accommodation of the lens, now with another, with 
competing objects in the field of view, and again with few or 
none. Various habit systems thus grow up, so that if even a part 
of the original visual component is actually present, the absent 
motor elements are redintegrated or associatively aroused (there 
is undoubtedly present a vast system of conditioned reflexes). 
This can be seen very plainly in watching any complex motor 
act. With every change of movement in the performer there 
goes along a more or less complete change of tensions in the mus- 
cular system of the observer, so that he is thrown into the proper 
“attitude’’ to make the next adjustment. For example, in watch- 
ing a fight, we tend to ward off a blow or to strike a blow. The 
inter-relations of these factors and the dependence of our im- 
mediate visual reactions upon past habits can best be seen, pos- 
sibly, in the way an experienced hunter sets his rifle sights to 
bring down his prey. The novice, going into a clear mountain- 
ous country for the first time, sets his sights for a too close range 
and the bullet falls short. The experienced hunter has learned 
by trial and error that he must increase his range over that which 
he would use on the plains. In the same way habits grow up 
based upon the size of the retinal image and upon the presence or 
absence of a clear image upon the retina. The presence or absence, 
too, of intermediate objects in the field of view to which we have 
previously made adjustments markedly affect our visual reac- 
tions to any distant object. An individual unused to the sea may 
start out to row his boat to a distant object. The chances are 
that it will take him two or three times as long as he had cal-

THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 125 
culated. The point to be emphasized in all of our visual adjust: 
ments is that we are dealing with integrated habit systems and 
conditioned reflex systems. Hach time the visual receptor is stim- 
ulated, the kinesthetic receptors (eye muscles, the ciliary 
muscles controlling adaptation and other factors) are simulta- 
neously stimulated and the complex of impulses resulting redinte- 
grates the established habit systems. The reactions which we make, 
whether a mere verbal reaction as to the form, size or distance 
of an object, or the starting out to walk to a distant point, are 
dependent upon such complex factors. It must be noted, too, 
that we can give no verbal report about the various réles played 
by the different factors. A deer springs up in the fog, in shad- 
ows, in dim light, in the red light of early morning, in the clear 
light of noon, on a mountain or on a plain: immediately the rifle 
is raised, pointed at a varying distance ahead of the animal, and 
fired. The animal falls. No hunter (not even a psychological 
one) can give a verbal report that contributes one iota to the 
event. We have made a visual motor adjustment and the com- 
plex factors involved in it all work harmoniously together. 
The Stereoscope.—Since visual stimuli really touch off habit 
systems, it follows that we can, by a very simple arrangement of 
visual conditions, initiate reactions which really belong to another 
general environmental setting. For example, if we obtain two 
photographs of a landscape taken simultaneously with a twin 
camera with the lenses fixed at the same distance apart as the 
two eyes, or slightly wider, and place these photographs in a 
stereoscope which allows the two images to fall upon correspond- 
ing points without fatigue of accommodation and without the 
intrusion of lateral images, we have a close approximation to the 
landscape situation as‘it stimulates the eye in nature—we obtain 
the ‘‘stereoscopic’’ effect even though the stimulus in each of the 
eyes is presented in one plane. The reaction obtained from the 
subject is like that obtained in ordinary binocular vision. The 
subject states that the various objects appear in different planes 
and at different distances from the eye. On the other hand, the 
visual conditions can be so arranged that the image which usually 
falls upon the right eye has to fall upon the left, and vice versa.
-P-A-G-E-140
    126 PSYCHOLOGY 
When this is done, an inverted relief is reported. ‘lhe pseudo- 
scope is an instrument admirably arranged to make the image 
ordinarily falling upon the right eye to fall upon the left and 
vice versa. Hollow objects are thus reacted to as solid objects, 
and solid objects as hollow. 
Untrustworthiness of Vision.—The various ‘‘illusions’’ or 
errors in visual reactions to which the eye is subject probably 
eae ee ein iaEE 
Fie. 19.—The Muller-Lyer figure. 
depend to some extent at least upon a certain lack of balance and 
coordination in the functioning of the motor system of the eye. 
For example, the eye under-reacts to acute angles and over-reacts 
to obtuse angles. If the movements of the eyes are photographed 
while traversing the two forms above (Fig. 19), it will be seen that 
the movements are more extended on the right-hand figure (obtuse 
  Fia, 20.—The Franklin figure. 
angles) than on the left where they are acute angles. In the 
latter case the eye movement is checked. The two horizontal 
lines are of course equal. Again, if a subject is asked to draw 
equal horizontal and vertical lines (in the form of a cross) with- 
out the aid of a rule, it will be found that he draws the vertical 
line too short. This is supposed to be due to the fact that hori- 
zontal eye movements are made with less effort than vertical ones. 
Occasionally the eye is downright untrustworthy. Make up a 
drawing like that shown in Fig. 20; have some one hold the 
drawing flat at the level of the chin six or eight inches from the 
face, and tell him to fixate on the point of intersection of any 
two lines. He will tell you that there are three lines, two hori-
-P-A-G-E-141
  THE RECEPTORS AND THEIR STIMULI 127 
zontal and a third line standing vertical to the drawing. This 
is really a very special case of diplopia or double vision. In the 
various text-books of psychology a great deal of attention is paid 
to these illusions, but little can be said about them at present 
which will be contributory. 
Visual Hallucinations—From ‘‘illusions’’ to ‘‘hallucina- 
tions’’ there is only a step. We have already said that the eye is 
always under stimulation. This is shown by the presence of 
action currents, the ideoretinal lights, and the hypnogogic 
images (long-continued after-effect of stimulation). Possibly 
also slight stimulation is afforded by each lens adjustment and 
by each change in convergence and divergence of the eye-ball. 
In addition, we know that there are centrifugal neural impulses 
reaching the eye from the central nervous system. The retina 
is peculiarly a sense organ that is never at rest and its activity 
is not wholly dependent upon outward stimulation of light. At- 
tention, too, has been called to the fact that visual impulses of a 
very simple character sometimes touch off complicated visual- 
motor habits. It is small wonder, then, that, in pathological 
cases where the retina is probably over-active so far as these 
internal changes are concerned, as in fevers, delirium tremens 
and the like, we see the subject reacting apparently to a visual 
object to which other persons present do not react. In under- 
standing this, attention is called to the fact that in normal per- 
sons, when there is a readiness of certain action systems to func- 
tion the moment a certain visual stimulus appears, the action 
is often touched off by any visual stimulus; for example, a con- 
cealed enemy is ready to fire at the head of a soldier. The soldier, 
instead of exposing himself, holds up his hat or a dummy. The 
enemy’s fire is drawn and a momentary respite is obtained with 
the chance to make the next objective. The higher the emotional 
tension, the easier it is to set off such premature reactions. This 
may account for the fact that a man in the throes of delirium 
tremens covers his head to shut out the vision of the snakes that 
squirm around the wall. His reading and his conversation with 
other imbibers have taught him that after drinking too much he 
will ‘‘see snakes.’’ Long indulgence has made such habit systems 
ready to function. Any wavering of fixation, the presence of  
-P-A-G-E-142
128 PSYCHOLOGY 
  sinuous shadows on the wall, the presence of any entoptic phe- 
nomenon may touch off both explicit and implicit types of reac- 
tion. We shall return to the fact again and again that visual 
reactions may become short-circuited into word reactions. The 
patient blind from birth can describe in appropriate words all 
of the beauties of the setting sun. Provided such a person were 
in the throes of delirium tremens and there were conditional 
emotional reflexes of a proper kind present, there is some reason 
to think that he might exhibit many of the characteristics of one 
suffering from visual hallucination. We have no such factual 
ease at hand, be it said. This explanation would hold perfectly 
well for the asserted cases of hallucinations appearing in patients 
long after both eye-balls have been removed. 
General Summary.—In considering, as has been done in this 
chapter, the various factors which must be taken into account in 
providing stimuli for the control of human action, it may be 
argued that we have not offered to the subjects experimented 
upon ‘the same kind of situations they will meet in daily life. 
Rarely are they stimulated with pure monochromatic lights, pure 
tones, with two olfactory substances which balance or cancel one 
another, and only rarely does the environment offer stimuli to 
which they make the simple types of reaction that they make in 
the laboratory. The laboratory obviously selects its problems and 
investigates one phase of them at a time. For this it has been 
criticised. The criticism would be justified if the laboratory made 
no effort at other times to make good this defect. That this 
science does attempt with some success to deal with larger human 
problems, total situations and total reactions will appear from 
some of the material we later present. [ven granting the nar- 
rowness of our conclusions in sensory physiology, it is safe to say 
that most of the facts we have presented here have been of service 
and will continue to be of service to one or another group of 
scieytists outside of psychology. Findings in sensory physiology 
are used by the physiologists themselves, by the neurologists, by 
specialists in ear, nose and throat, by the surgeon, by the psychi- 
atrist, and in the Army and Navy, as well a$‘in the arts and trades. 
To trace their use in these fields is beyond our present aim.

  CHAPTER IV 
THE ELEMENTARY FACTS ABOUT THE NEURO-PHYSI- 
OLOGICAL BASIS OF ACTION 
Introduction.—Having studied the receptors and found that, 
their activity involves the initiation of neural impulses, our next 
problem is to learn something about neural conduction and the 
arrangement of pathways over which such impulses must pass 
in order to reach the effectors—the muscles and glands. We 
should say in the beginning that all neural impulses’initiated in 
a sense organ have to pass either through the spinal cord or the 
brain or both of these organs before reaching the muscles and 
glands. Hence it is necessary for us to take up the elementary 
facts about their structure and functions. If we attempted to 
make a study of the whole nervous system, even in outline, we 
should find that our task could not be accomplished without 
going into a laboratory and actually working with neurological 
material. We can, though, apart from such laboratories, obtain 
a fairly good working notion of (1) many of the things which 
the nervous system as a whole has to do, (2) of the elementary 
neural structures and (3) the way the latter are chained to- 
gether to form the reflex ares that make possible our acts in 
daily life. 
The Unit of the Nervous System.—The unit of the nervous 
system is the neurone. A complete neuroneis shown in Fig. 21. 
It consists (1) of a cell body with (2) its axone and (3) its den- 
drites. The cell body is a somewhat complicated and not thor. 
oughly understood structure. It contains a nucleus which does not 
differ greatly from the nucleus of any other cell. The most char- 
acteristic part of the cell is its cytoplasm, which is made up of 
neurofibrils, fine fibrils that are continuous throughout the axone, 
cell body and dendrites. The perifibrillar substance is a fluid- 
like substance that st ‘rounds the neurofibrils. The cell contains 
in addition chromophilic substance, flake-like masses scattered

  body which is called a neuroblast, 
first appears. If one were to watch 
the neuroblast develop into a 
partially complete neurone (as has 
actually been done), he would see 
the axone hillock first form and from 
it would develop the slender axone 
process, and later the dendrites. 
The axone, az, Fig. 21, is a 
slender outgrowth from the cell body 
varying in length from a fraction of 
amm. to more than a meter. Under 
the high power microscope it is seen 
to be made up of elementary neuro- 
fibrils. There is usually only one 
axone to a cell body., It is to be 
distinguished from the dendrites by 
its straighter course, its uniform 
diameter and smooth outline, Fig. 
24. Shortly after leaving the cell 
body the axone may become myeli- 
nated, i.e., covered by a fatty sheath 
whose function may be insulating 
or nutritive. It may possibly also 
be concerned with conduction. In 
addition to the medullary sheath, 
many of the axones are covered also 
with the more primitive sheath of 
Schwann or neurilemma. The sheath 
of Schwann is probably not found 
jin the central nervous system. Cer- 
tain axones, for example, those ot 
the sympathetic neurones and of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
NEURO-PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF ACTION 131 
  olfactory, may have a 
sheath of Schwann with- 
out a medullary sheath. 
We have then two main 
divisions of axones: my- 
elinated axones, with or 
without a neurilemma; 
and non-myelinated ax- 
ones, with or without a 
neurilemma. The axone 
on ending usually splits 
up into a terminal brush. 
These brushes always end 
(1) around the dendrite 
of another neurone or (2) 
in a muscle or gland or 
(3) in some sense organ 
structure (if the peri- 
pheral process of an affer- 
ent neurone is classed 
as an axone) (page 116). 
On their course inside the 
central nervous system 
axones give off collaterals 
or side branches which Fra. 22—Diagram of a cell body from the ventral horn of the gray matter of the human spinal end around dendrites of cord showing arrangement of neurofibrils. az, axone; li, interfibrillar spaces occupied by chromophilic sub-

of the neurone are the dendrites, d, Fig. 21. They have a 
structure similar to that of the cell body. They may be exceed- 
ingly numerous or lacking altogether. They exhaust them- 
selves by subdivision and end near the cell body. To this 
general statement there is one exception: the dendrite of an 
afferent spinal neurone (Fig. 23) consists of a single process 
which is exactly like the axone—it runs a straight course, it is 
smooth and myelinated. However, it ends in a sense organ and 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  132 PSYCHOLOGY 
conducts toward the cell body. We have learned that axones 
conduct the impulse centrifugally, that is, away from the cell 
body, and that the dendrites conduct centripetally. Hence the 
outgrowth from such a cell body as we are considering is an 
axone so far as structure is concerned but a dendrite in its fune- 
tion. Dendrites of all other types of neurones, since they are 
so intimately a part of the cell body, are probably important 
devices for securing nutrition for. the 
whole neurone. They are beautifully y = see | 
contrived for this purpose since they ee . 
offer many points of contact with their 
nutrient environment. The dendrites 
must also take part in conduction since 
the end of axones often comes in contact 
only with the dendrites. 
The neurone as a whole is thus the an- 
atomical, embryological, functional and

The Reflex Arc.—Although the neurone is a unit of the ner- 
vous system it cannot function alone. It becomes functional from 
a conduction standpoint only when its connections are estab- 
lished. The functional unit of conduction is called a reflex are.

in Fig. 24. In Fig. 25 the neurone is marked 1. One of its

of a third neurone (spinal motor neurone) whose cell body lies 
in the gray matter (anterior horn) of the cord, but the axone of 
which ends in a motor structure, MS. This neurone is numbered 3. 
Oceasionally possibly it may happen that a reflex are is com- 
pleted without the intervention of the intermediate central 
neurone. In such a case the peripheral sensory neurone, 1, may 
end, or one of its collaterals may end, directly around the den-, 
drites of the motor neurone, 3. These are only schematic pic- 
tures, however. Usually many neurones are involved in any 
reflex are. 
The-Synapse.—There has been a great amount of discussion

  as to the kind of connection existing among neurones. It seems 
safe to say that it is usually one of contact like that shown in Fig. 
26—the end processes of an axone or its collateral come into 
tmore or less intimate contact with the bushy dendrites or 
cell body of another neurone. The place where functional con- 
tact occurs is called a ‘‘synapse.’’ Many physiologists believe 
that the synapse is the most important part of the reflex are. If 
the relation is one of contact there must be a surface of separation 
there, and this, it seems, in some way affects conduction. An 
impulse takes longer to traverse a reflex are which always con- 
tains one or more synapses than to pass an equal distance over a
-P-A-G-E-149
  NEURO-PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF ACTION 135 
nerve trunk. Furthermore, an impulse may travel in either direc- 
tion along a nerve fiber, but it can travel in only one direction 
(forward) through the reflex are, 7.e., from the axones to the 
dendrites. The idea has gained ground that the synapse can offer 
varying resistance to the passage of a neural impulse. It is as- 
sumed that an impulse coming from a sense organ might very well 
pass out to the muscles over either 
one of two neurones, but the mo- 
mentary resistance at the one sy- 
napse may be so high that the im- 
pulse can pass out only over the 
other. It can readily be seen that 
this hypothesis may be of help in 
explaining habit,/failure to obtain 
the predicted response, sleep, ete. 
The All-or-None Law.—lIf 
the all-or-none law is established 
the conception of the synapse 
will have to be modified. The 
all-or-none law states that if a 
nerve fiber is stimulated it is stim- 
ulated maximally in each and in 
all of its parts. Hence grading sroukl“sei boat me Rad MR of neural activity by the action Cee eseted eee . - herve of rabbit); a, a, a, fibers of the of the synapse is not possible, for cochlear nerve which break up. into

a decrement, it will become max- C°t*s¥ Wm. Wood & Co. 
imal again after a short distance. This can be shown quite 
clearly in the case where a nerve trunk is being stimulated elec- 
trically. The resulting action current is taken as the measure 
of the impulse and is registered by means of the deflections of the 
string of a galvanometer. If we partially anesthetize the fibers 
in a stretch of a nerve trunk and measure the amount of deflection 
in the area so narecotized, the magnitude of the deflection is de- 
creased ; but if we measure the propagated disturbance (impulse) 
   
-P-A-G-E-150
  136 PSYCHOLOGY 
  shortly after it passes out from this region where it underwent a 
decrement we shall find that the deflection of the galvanometer 
string has returned to its normal magnitude. Grading of a muscu- 
lar response then must be a function of the number of muscular 
fibers thrown into action, and this is a function, in turn, of the 
number of axones bearing impulses to the muscle. Slight stimula- 
tion of a nerve trunk will produce a small contraction of the 
muscle because with a slight stimulus only a few nerve fibers are 
aroused. As soon as all of the fibers are bearing impulses no in- 
crease in the intensity of the stimulating current will produce a 
larger contraction. Our common experience teaches us that there 
is a rough proportionality between magnitude of stimulus and 
magnitude of response. But this grading is probably not a func- 
tion of the synapse nor does it take place in the central nervous 
system.t The all-or-none law must still be looked upon as a re- 
search problem. If the various implications of the law are con- 
firmed it will probably profoundly modify many of the present 
conceptions of neuro-physiology. 
Some of the Facts Known About Neural Action—lIt has 
been shown that the speed of the neural impulse in the motor nerve 
of man is about 125 meters per second. Apparently the velocity 
may be altered in various ways. Variations in temperature alter 
it most markedly. If one starts with a low temperature and tests 
the velocity it is found that for each 10° C. rise in temperature 
the velocity is doubled until the physiological limit is reached. 
Cooling a section of the nerve beyond a certain point will block 
the nervous impulse. Anesthetics and narcotics may also be ap- 
plied locally to the nerve, both decreasing its irritability and 
conductivity, or suspending them entirely. Conductivity and 
irritability may also be suspended by depriving the nerve of 
oxygen. With the restoration of oxygen these functions are re- 
stored. The questions as to whether activity can fatigue the 
nerve fiber as it is known to fatigue the cell body, and whether   
+ We shall see later, however, that impulses from the cerebral structures 
may inhibit action in lower motor neurones. This, however, is a function of 
the refractory phase of the neurone and of the time relations of the impulses 
impinging upon it.
-P-A-G-E-151
  
  NEURO-PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF ACTION 1387 
nerve fibers show chemical change after or during activity, have 
not been answered with complete certainty.” Certainly the nerve 
fiber is fatigued with the very greatest difficulty in ordinary lab- 
oratory experiments where the electrical current is used to excite 
it. That both the resting and active fibers show metabolic change 
is becoming generally admitted. Recent work tends to show that 
the resting fiber gives off CO,, that it eliminates it faster during 
functional activity and that the elimination is as great per unit 
of weight as that of the cell body. There can thus be little doubt 
that since oxygen is needed also by the fiber to maintain its func- 
tional properties, and since it gives off CO,, functional activity in 
the fiber is connected with a chemical reaction of some kind. 
Nature of the Neural Impulse.—The tendency is growing to 
regard the neural impulse as the rapid passage of a wave of chem- 
ical decomposition. If a hair on the skin is touched it is assumed 
that the structure and composition of the surface film (surface 
films must exist between two structures which are in contact) of 
the axone ending around the hair is altered. ‘‘The state of elec- 
trical surface polarization is thus changed; and the bioelectrie 
circuit arising between altered and adjoining unaltered regions 
completes the activation’’ (Lillie). These local currents extend 
for only a few centimeters, but at the point where they end there 
is the condition at hand for starting a new disturbance of film 
(between the portion of the nerve which has just been active and 
the resting portion which joins it) and the process is thus re- 
peated the whole length of the conducting are. The speed of prop- 
agation of the wave or impulse is thus slow notwithstanding the 
  
*The question of the fatigue in nerve cells, while generally admitted, 
has not been very well worked out. There seems to be agreement that certain 
histological changes can be noticed after a cell has been made to function 
severely. There is possibly an increase in the size of the cell, a diminution 
of the chromatic (Nissl) substance, and possibly even a displacement. of 
the nucleus (Hodge). In prolonged activity the chromatin may completely 
disappear. . Presumably in the cell body as in the active muscle lactie acid 
and CO, are formed. Certainly oxygen is necessary for the proper function- 
ing of the cell. Very little can be said with certainty about the role the cell 
body plays during the conduction of the neural impulse. It is certainly best 
to look upon the cell as a nutritive center of the neurone as a whole.

essential electric nature of the phenomena. Lillie gives the 
process as follows: ‘‘The rapid passage of waves of chemical de- 
composition (probably oxidative in nature and involving some 
structural change) over the surface of the reacting element, fol- 
lowed immediately by a reverse change which restores the original 
or resting condition, is what appears to take place in a nerve or 
other living structure during conduction. Associated with the 
chemical process is a local electrical cireuit by whose electrolytic

Introduction.—The brain and spinal cord with their various 
peripheral connections may be looked upon as a unitary aggre- 
gation of simple and complex reflex conduction systems such as 
we have just considered. The brain and cord connected on the 
one hand with the sense organs and on the other hand with the 
muscles and glands afford a multiple connection system between 
the various receptors and the various effectors. No matter how 
minute the sense organ structure is which is stimulated, the im- 
pulse arising there can travel to the central system and produce 
a response of the whole organism which is entirely out of pro- 
portion to the actual energy applied at the sense organ. In other 
words, a stimulus applied anywhere on the body produces not 
only a local segmental reflex action, but it changes the system of 
tensions and secretions probably in every part of the body. 
To understand how the nervous system is put together we 
must first spend some time upon the gross or macroscopic features 
of the brain and spinal cord, coming back finally to the discussion 
of internal architecture and inter-relations among the neurones 
themselves. Once the gross structures are found they will serve 
as landmarks in the description of the various pathways in the 
brain and cord. 
The brain and cord together are known as the central nervous 
system (systema nervorum centrale), but as we have pointed out 
the central nervous system. is connected on the one hand with a

  sense organ by means of the afferent peripheral cerebro-spinal 
neurones, and on the other hand with the muscles by means of the 
efferent peripheral cerebro-spinal neurones. These latter divi- 
sions are often spoken of as the peripheral nervous system (sys- 
tema nervorum periphericum). Usually the sympathetic or auto- 
nomic system (systema nervorum sympathicum) is included as a 
part of the peripheral nervous system. We shall leave the sym- 
pathetic out of account at present, giving it a separate treat- 
ment on page 170. 
Gross Features of the Spinal Cord (Medulla Spinalis).—The 
spinal cord is shown together with the brain in Fig. 27. The 
cord is about eighteen inches long and extends from the first 
cervical vertebra (more accurately from the foramen magnum of 
the occipital bone) to the lower part of the body of the first 
lumbar vertebra. Its upper portion is continuous with the 
medulla oblongata, which is the lowest part of the brain. The 
lower portion of the cord tapers conically and ends in a slender 
filament, the filum teminale. The cord is invested with three 
membranes. These are shown in Fig. 28: (1) the dura mater 
(dura mater spinalis) is a tough protective membrane which 
forms a lining for the bony cavity; (2) a thin intermediate mem- 
brane, the arachnoid (arachnoidea spinalis); and (3) finally 
a highly vascular membrane which closely invests the neural 
structures, the pia (pia mater spinalis) . 
The cord is almost cylindrical in shape with two enlargements, 
a cervical (intumescentia cervicalis) and a lumbar (intumescentia 
lumbalis) (Fig. 27). The spinal nerve roots leave from regular 
segments in the cord (Fig. 36). There are thirty-one such seg- 
ments corresponding to the thirty-one spinal nerves. It will be 
noted that the cord in this respect is symmetrical in that there 
are thirty-one nerves on each side. The cord is divided into 
white and gray matter. The outer portion of the cord is com- 
posed of white matter (substantia alba) while the central 
H-shaped portion is composed of gray matter (substantia grisea). 
The white matter is made up largely of myelinated axones coming 
from the spinal ganglia (to be described on page 154) and the 
myelinated axones growing out of the cells lying in the gray

  NEURO-PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF ACTION 141 
matter. The gray matter is made up largely of nerve cells with 
their dendrites and of the unmyelinated end brushes of axones 
ending around these cell bodies. In Fig. 29 attention is called to 
the dorsal median septum (suleus medianus posterior) and to 
the ventral median fissure (fissura mediana anterior). These 
structures serve to orient one immediately with respect to the 
ventral and dorsal aspects of the cord. The ventral aspect of the

cord faces the ventral cavity of the body. Since the cord is sym- 
metrical usually, only one-half of it is described. We can divide 
the white matter of each half of the cord as follows (Fig. 29) : 
(1) a ventral funiculus (funiculus anterior, 6), (2) a dorsal 
funiculus (funiculus posterior, 11), and (3) a lateral funiculus 
(funiculus lateralis, 9). The gray matter can similarly be divided 
iato a (1) dorsal column—dorsal horn of gray matter—(columna 
posterior, 12), (2) ventral column—ventral horn of gray matter 
—(columna anterior, 7), and (3) lateral column—lateral horn 
of gray matter—(columna lateralis, 8). 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
    142 PSYCHOLOGY 
Extending through the entire length of the cord there is a 
small central canal (canalis centralis) to be found in the sub- 
stance of the gray commissure. It is the remains of the primitive 
ectodermal canal. The canal is the counterpart of the several 
ventricles in the brain, at least so far as origin is concerned. 
The canal and the fourth ventricle communicate at the cala- 
mus scriptorius. 
W113 Gross Features of the Brain (En- 
cephalon).—The ventral aspect or base of 
the brain is shown in Figs. 30 and 31. The 
brain lies almost horizontally in the 
cranial cavity. We shall give a short 
description of the various features of the 
brain, beginning with the first or lowest 
structure. We shall try to describe to- 
gether the various structures which be- 
long together, but occasionally it has

cerebellum. On the posterior aspect of the medulla one also finds 
two slight swellings, the tuberculum cuneatum (Fig. 32, 23) and 
the clava (Fig. 32, 4). At the upper border of the medulla and 
continuous with it is to be found the pons (Varoli) (Fig. 30, 
8). The pons is really a great band of transverse axones 
coursing about the ventral aspect of the brain stem. Its fibers

pathways between higher and 
lower levels of the central 
nervous system. The trans- 
verse fibers of the pons form 
the middle, cerebellar ped- 
uncle (brachium pontis) (Fig. 
82, 20). In addition to the 
axone system in the pons, 
there are a number of gray 
cellular masses which serve as 
nuclei of reception for the 
sensory roots of cranial affer- 
ent nerves which enter in or 
near the pons and others serv-

The cerebellum or hind 
brain (Fig. 30, 4) lies dor- 
sal to the pons and me- 
dulla and overhangs the lat- 
ter. It in turn is overhung 
by the occipital lobes of the 
cerebral hemisphere (Fig. 
35). The cerebellum is a 
fairly large structure weigh- 
ing about 140 grams. We 
have already spoken of two 
of its peduncles, the middle or 
pons, and the inferior (the 
medulla and cord connection). 
It is connected with the higher 
brain centers by the superior

projection neurones, (2) commissural neurones, and (3) association neu- 
rones, meaning respectively (1) neurones ascending and descending in the 
central nervous system, (2) neurones connecting the two halves of any 
part of the central nervous system, and (3) neurones connecting distant 
parts of the same side of the nervous system.

on each side are cut away the cerebellum can be removed. Fig.

Inferior) —Turning again to the ventral surface of the brain 
(Fig. 31), we see the two cerebral peduncles, 21 (pedunculus cere- 
bri), just above the pons. They are nearly covered by the over- 
lapping of the temporal lobes of the cerebral hemispheres. The 
cerebral peduncles are two large bundles of axones (right and 
left) connecting the parts we have just described with the parts 
yet to be described. They are close together when they emerge 
from the pons, but gradually separate as they pass upward, 
forming a recess which is occupied by the mammillary bodies (cor- 
pus mammillare) (Fig. 31, 10). These latter structures belong 
really to the forebrain. The term cerebral peduncle is very 
loosely used. In addition to the ascending and descending axones 
of which it is largely composed, there are to be found immedi- 
ately dorsal to the fibers the substantia nigra, a pigmented cellu- 
lar mass, and the tegmentum, in which are to be found many 
cellular masses serving as nuclei of reception for ascending and 
descending axones. 
Fig. 33, which is obtained by splitting the brain symmetri- 
cally from front to back, thus dividing it into right and left 
halves, shows a medial view of the stem and mid-brain struc- 
tures. One finds there the corpora quadrigemina, four (two on 
each side of the midline) small, but well-marked rounded masses 
(Fig. 33, 15). The lower two (right and left) are called the 
inferior colliculi, the upper two, the superior colliculi. They are 
much better shown in Fig. 32, 17 and 18. The two inferior col- 
liculi are continued into the medial geniculate bodies (corpus 
geniculatum mediale, Fig. 32, 10) and thence into the thalamus 
by heavy strands of axones called brachia. In a similar way the 
superior colliculi are continued into the lateral geniculate bodies 
(corpus geniculatum laterale). The inferior colliculi and the 
medial geniculate bodies are a part of the auditory apparatus, 
while the superior colliculi and the lateral geniculate bodies are 
a part of the visual apparatus. The pineal gland (corpus pineale) 
is shown in Fig. 33, 12, and Fig. 32, 14. 
The Thalamus and Related Structures.—We have already 
noted three of the structures belonging to the thalamic region, 
namely, the medial and lateral geniculate bodies and the pineal
-P-A-G-E-162
  148 PSYCHOLOGY 
gland. The thalamus proper is an ovoid, couch-like mass 
which on its mesial surface forms the wall of the third ventricle. 
Fig. 33, 11, shows the thalamus in the left half of the brain. 
The massa intermedia (Fig. 33, 10) is a mass of gray matter 
connecting the two thalami. The medial view does not show the 
thalamus very well. Fig. 32, 16, shows the dorsal and lateral 
extension of this most important structure. Fig. 44 shows a 
coronal section through the thalamus. The dorsal surface of the 
thalamus usually shows four eminences, indicating the nuclear 
masses within. They are the anterior nucleus, the medial nucleus, 
the lateral nucleus, and the pulvinar. Only the pulvinar can be 
clearly seen in Fig. 32, 11. On the mesial surface near the thal- 
amus are to be seen the pituitary gland (hypophysis cerebri) 
(Fig. 33, 4). Note the ventral view of this same structure (Fig. 
31, 18). The mammillary bodies (Fig. 33, 3) and the optic chi- 
asma (chiasma opticum) (Fig. 33, 5) are indicated both in the 
median section (Fig. 33) and in the ventral section (Fig. 31). 
These structures belong really to the telencephalon, as do the 
structures which are to be immediately described. 
The Basal Ganglia.—Continuous with the thalamus but above 
it and lateral to it is to be found in each hemisphere the caudate 
nucleus (nucleus caudatus) (Fig. 32, 13, and Fig. 44, 13) and 
the lenticular nucleus (nucleus lentiformis) (Fig. 44, 10 and 12). 
They are two large cellular masses called the basal ganglia. Sep- 
arating the two cellular masses is an axone band called the in- 
ternal capsule (capsula interna) (Fig. 44, 20). These structures 
are shown only in a coronal section. The three structures to- 
gether are sometimes called the striate body. If the septum 
pellucidum were torn away (Fig. 33, 8) one would see first into 
the lateral ventricle, then the head of the caudate nucleus would 
appear as one of the boundaries of the cavity. The internal cap- 
sule is of vital importance. In it are gathered together in a nar- 
row space nearly all of the ascending and descending axones which 
connect the cortex and the lower structures. 
The Corpus Callosum.—The corpus callosum, which is an

two hemispheres are gently pressed apart: it appears as thr floor 
of the great longitudinal fissure (Fig. 34, 1).
-P-A-G-E-164
  150 PSYCHOLOGY 
The Cerebral_Hemispheres.—In man the cerebral hemi- 
spheres form the largest part of the central nervous system. Fig. 
34 is a view of the hemispheres from above. They present an 
ovoid surface which corresponds to the inner surface of the vault 
of the cranium. The two hemispheres are separated from each 
other by the longitudinal fissure (fissura longitudinalis) which 
runs from the frontal pole to the occipital pole. A deep fold 
of the dura mater dips into the longitudinal fissure called the 
falx cerebri (not shown). It will be seen that when viewed from 
above the cerebral hemispheres completely obscure all other 
cranial structures. The cerebellum lies immediately under the 
occipital pole. There are three surfaces of the hemispheres: (1) 
the convex surface as seen from above (Fig. 34) or the side (Fig. 
35), (2) the mesial surface, which can be seen only by pulling 
the two hemispheres apart (Fig. 33). The mesial surfaces 
bound the longitudinal fissure, or rather the falx cerebri lies be- 
tween the two mesial surfaces. (3) The basal surface shown 
in Fig. 30.° 
In addition to the structures described each hemisphere in- 
cludes a convoluted and infolded pallium or mantle divided into 
lobes and gyri. The pallium consists of the gray outside surface 
called the cortex. The white matter of the cerebrum lies below 
the cortex. Only about one-third of the cortex is visible; the 
other two-thirds is found in the walls and floors of the sulci and 
fissures. The folds of the cortex are called gyri or convolutions. 
They are separated from one another by sulci or by the deeper 
furrows called fissures. The outside surface of each hemisphere 
(Fig. 35) (pallium) is divided into lobes; the frontal (lobus 
frontalis), parietal (lobus parietalis), occipital (lobus occipi- 
talis), and temporal (lobus temporalis). The central lobe (in- 
sula) is concealed. 
  
*The caudate and lenticular nuclei and the internal capsule (and the 
lateral ventricle), which we have already identified belong to and should be 
described with the cerebral hemispheres. We considered them with the more 
caudal structures so that we could describe continuous and adjoining parts 
beginning with the cord and ending with the corpus callosum.

In order to work out these divisions, first locate the great 
longitudinal fissure (Fig. 34, 1) separating the two hemispheres, 
then the fissure of Sylvius (fissura cerebri lateralis Sylvii), 
which is a lateral fissure, shown in Fig. 35, 4. The fissure of 
Rolando [sulcus centralis (Rolandi) ] begins above, near the high- 
est point of the hemisphere and courses outward and downward 
over the lateral surface of the brain (Fig. 35, 3) to the horizontal

(fissura parieto-occipitalis) fissure can be seen on the mesial sur- 
face (Fig. 33, 14). It runs from a cleft shown on the extended 
convex surface (Fig. 34, 13) downward and a little forward to 
join the calcarine fissure (fissura calearina) (Fig. 33,17). These 
two fissures enclose a wedge-shaped portion of the mesial cortex 
ealled the cuneus—an important visual station. Having located 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
152 PSYCHOLOGY 
  these more important fissures, we can divide the pallium into its 
lobes. (1) The frontal lobe has a convex, lateral and basal sur- 
face. The convex surface begins at the frontal pole (polus fron- 
talis) and is bounded posteriorly by the fissure of Rolando. The 
mesial boundary is not well marked. The basal portion is shown 
in Fig. 30, Lying on its surface are to be seen the olfactory bulbs 
(bulbus olfactorius) and tracts (tractus olfactorius). (2) The 
parietal lobe lies behind the frontal in front of the occipital lobe 
and above the temporal. It is bounded frontally by the fissure of 
Rolando, and laterally by the fissure of Sylvius. Posteriorly it 
has no natural boundary, but a line drawn from the end of the 
fissure of Sylvius to the cleft of the parieto-occipital fissure will 
give a convenient boundary. Its mesial boundary is the parieto- 
occipitalis. (3) The mesial surface of the occipital lobe begins 
at this fissure and extends to the occipital pole (polus occipitalis) . 
This lobe has a basal surface (that immediately above the cere- 
bellum) and a lateral convex surface. (4) The temporal lobe 
lies below the fissure of Sylvius (a portion is concealed in the 
fissure of Sylvius). It has a convex surface, shown in Fig. 35, and 
a basal surface. (5) The central lobe (insula) is concealed. It 
lies in the floor of the fissure of Sylvius. It can be exposed by 
gently opening out the fissure. The location of the insula can 
be seen in Fig. 44, 11. 
It is in definite parts of the cortical surface of these lobes 
that the various ascending projection fibers coming from the cord 
and brain stem, which are soon to be described, find their ter- 
minations, thus giving the nerves of special senses—visual, audi- 
tory and olfactory, ete.—a definite cortical representation. We 
shall find further that cell bodies lying in the cortex give rise to 
axones which form descending or returning pathways to the lower 
structures. To make clear this architecture we must turn to a 
study of the internal structure of the brain and spinal cord. We 
shall first consider the make-up or composition of the peripheral 
spinal and cranial nerves and then examine into the connections of 
these nerves with the internal structures of the cord and brain.

The Peripheral Neurones of the Cord.—After this brief gen- 
eral discussion of the easily observable features of the nervous 
system as a whole, we are prepared to examine the system of

pathways connecting the sense organs and the muscles. The 
first feature to study is how a spinal nerve is made up. We have 
already noted that there are thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves 
Each nerve is made up of two roots, an efferent or motor root and 
an afferent or sensory root. The dorsal or afferent root (Fig.

36, 1) plunges horizontally into the cord, roughly at the tip of the 
dorsal horn. The ventral root (Fig. 36, 4) enters (really 
emerges) at the same level. 
Upon each of the thirty-one afferent roots there is situated a 
swelling called the ganglion (Fig. 36, 3). This is a structure

  easily observable without the aid of a microscope. It contains 
the cell bodies which give rise to the afferent peripheral processes 
and roots. A complete afferent neurone is shown on page 132. 
Attention was called there to the fact that these neurones have 
no dendrites unless we call the processes running out to the 
sensory surface the dendrite. The dorsal root (Fig. 36, 1) is 
made up of the typical axone process from these cell bodies. In 
man there are nearly one and a third million of axones in the 
dorsal roots of the two sides of the spinal cord, but less than 
one-half million in the ventral root. If the ventral root is fol- 
lowed back into the cord it will be found that it is really an out- 
growth from cell bodies lying in the ventral column (of gray 
matter). The genetic relations then are: cells in the ventral horn 
give rise to axones which leave the cord at a given horizontal level, 
the efferent roots. Each cell in the spinal ganglion at the same 
horizontal level gives rise to a single afferent axone which 
branches like a T or a Y, one process entering the cord as a 
dorsal root fibre, the other process (dendrite) going to a 
sense organ in the skin, muscle, tendon or joint. Just peripheral- 
ward to the spinal ganglion the motor fibers join the sensory. The 
combination is from then on called a nerve (Fig. 36, 2), for ex- 
ample, the first thoracic nerve on the right side. The nerve as a 
whole runs in a dense sheath of connective tissue, the epineureum 
(not shown). Somewhere in its course most of the afferent axones 
leave the epineural sheath to end in receptors (of muscles, ten- 
dons, joints and skin). The efferent axones enter the muscles 
and end in a typical way, shown in Fig. 47, page 177. Theoreti- 
cally it should be possible to destroy all ef the afferent supply of 
neurones to a given skin and muscular area without destroying 
the efferent neurones. According to Head, some afferent neu- 
rones, however, always run with the motor fibers so that in order 
completely to rob an area of its afferent supply, both motor and 
sensory nerves would have to be cut.® 
  
° Head and Rivers have attempted to divide the cutaneous fibers up into 
a protopathic group (“including cutaneous pain, a diffuse non-localizable

The Peripheral Neurones of the Brain.—There are twelve 
pairs of peripheral cranial nerves. Their superficial points of 
origin (efferent) or entrance (afferent) are shown on the ventral 
view of the brain (Figs. 30 and 31). The cranial nerves do not 
correspond at all closely to the pattern just. described for the 
spinal nerves; some are wholly afferent, some wholly efferent, 
while others are mixed. The following table from Hardesty 
(Morris, Human Anatomy) gives the names and numbers of the 
nerves, whether they are afferent, efferent or mixed, and their 
distribution.

Each of the afferent nerves or the afferent portion of the mixed 
nerves has a ganglion corresponding to a spinal ganglion. The 
ganglion, however, may be at some distance from the point of 
entrance into the central system: the ganglion for the cochlear 
division of the VIII nerve lies in the modiolus of the cochlea 
(ganglion spirale); for the vestibular division it lies blended 
within the nerve at the bottom of the internal auditory meatus 
(ganglion of Scarpa) (Fig. 8, 3). In the I or olfactory nerve 
it lies in the mucous membrane of the nose. In the II or optic 
the relations are peculiar; the first neurone, cell body and 
axone lie in the retina (Fig. 17). The cranial nerve marked II 
(optic) is not a peripheral nerve but a central tract.’ 
The V or trigeminus springs from cells in the semilunar 
(Gasserian) ganglion—which lies in Meckel’s cave, a cleft in the 
dura mater in the upper surface of the petrous portion of the 
temporal bone. The sensory fibers of the facial, VII (Glosso- 
palatine), spring from cells in the geniculate ganglion. This 
ganglion is situated within the canalis facialis (Fallopii). The 
superior ganglion and the inferior ganglion of the afferent part 
of the [IX (Glossopharyngeal) lie in the jugular foramen. The 
X has two ganglia—jugular, which lies also in the jugular fora- 
men, and the ganglion nodosum, which lies below the base of 
the skull and in front of the jugular vein. 
A discussion of the peripheral distribution and the central 
connections of these nerves other than those of the special senses 
is a task too vast to undertake outside of an anatomical labo- 
ratory. We shall, however, indicate some of the more important 
central pathways of the afferent nerves in our discussion of the 
ascending and descending pathways in the cord and brain. 
Course of the Ascending Neurones in the Cord and Brain.— 
Turning to the study of the further course of the afferent roots 
inside the centra] nervous system, we find in the spinal cord that 
they may establish several connections upon their entrance. The 
afferent root may end at that level or above or below it. After 
entrance it usually divides by a Y division (Fig. 23) sending 
* The reason for this depends upon the embryology of the eye. The retina

of the embryological brain.

one branch downward (caudal) in the dorsal funiculus and the 
other branch upward in the dorsal funiculus (sometimes as far 
as the medulla oblongata, where it ends in a nucleus of recep- 
tion). At various levels each of these branches gives off collat- 
erals which end around the dendrites of cell bodies within the 
cord. The following relationships are known to occur: (1) such 
a collateral may end around the dendrites of a motor cell in the 
ventral horn on the same or on the opposite side, forming the 
ventral

  Fra, 37.—Diagram of some of the types of connections between the afferent fibers of the dorsal root and the motor fibers of the ventral root (rabbit). The various fibers are 
numbered: 1 and la represent collateral branches of the dorsal root fibers which run directly to the dendrites of the motor neurones in the ventral column of the same or opposite side; 2, dendrites of ventral column cells crossing to the opposite side, meeting with the ter- 
minals of 1 above (probably a very rare connection); 3a, 3b and 3c are central neurones; these neurones may connect the sensory root ending with the motor neurone in the same segment on the same or opposite side or they may send their axones to end at lower or higher levels; 4 is a collateral of the motor axone returning to end in the gray matter

the dendrites of the ventral horn cells themselves may cross to ‘ . . * . . 
the opposite side in the central commissure and end in contact 
with a collateral of an afferent root. In either 1 or 2 above a 
short central interconnecting neurone may be interpolated. Its 
cell body lies in the dorsal horn and its axone ends around ventral 
cells of that or higher or lower levels. Certain other relationships 
which may occur will appear when we come to consider special 
tracts in the cord. Fig. 37 shows some of the possible connections.
-P-A-G-E-172
    158 PSYCHOLOGY 
Connection of Cord with Cerebellum (Ascending Neu- 
rones.)—Certain of the collaterals and axones of afferent roots 
end around cells in Clark’s column (Fig. 38, 19), which is to 
be found in the posterior horn. Two tracts arise from these cells. 
They ascend in the lateral funiculus. One of the tracts (tractus 
72,,/3  Spino-cerebellaris dorsalis, also called di- 
| rect cerebellar tract and Flechsig’s tract) 
(Fig. 39, 7), enters the cerebellum via the 
inferior peduncle, the other (tractus spino- 
cerebellaris ventralis) (Fig. 39, 5) enters 
the cerebellum by way of the superior ped- 
uncle. The two tracts carry impulses from 
the kinesthetic sense organs to the cere- 
bellum. We shall see later that the cerebel-

end there around definite cell groups called nuclei of reception. 
The cells are so numerous that their presence is marked by an 
actual swelling shown in Fig. 32, 23 and 4. There are really two 
reception nuclei in each dorsal funiculus, the nucleus funiculi 
gracilis and the nucleus funiculi euneati (the dorsal funiculus as a 
whole being divided into two fasciculi, the gracilis lying nearest 
the median septum and the cuneatus occupying the remainder of 
the space (Fig. 39, 10 and 9). The cell bodies lying in these 
nuclei give off axones (ascending neurones of the second order) 
which swing over to the opposite side, passing under the spinal

canal, which in this region is near the dorsal surface (Fig. 40). 
This crossing is known as the sensory decussation (decussatio 
lemniscorum). The fibers after crossing form the medial lem- 
niscus (lemniscus medialis), which can be seen in every cross- 
section from the medulla to the thalamus. The lemniscus is 
being constantly enlarged because ascending neurones of the sec-

ond order from the cranial afferent nerves (after decussating) 
are constantly joining. These ascending neurones in the medial 
lemniscus end around the cell bodies in the thalamus on the same 
side (second relay station). The cells there give rise to axones 
(ascending neurones of the third order) which pass through the 
internal capsule (Fig. 44, 20) through the corona radiata (Fig. 
44, 16) then they ray out to end in the gyri behind the central 
suleus—the so-called somesthetie reception area in the cortex. 
Summarizing: In this system (kinesthetic) the peripheral end 
of the first afferent axone terminates in a sensory structure in

muscle, tendon or joint. The central end enters the cord, turns 
upward and reaches the medulla (ascending neurone of the first 
order). The neurones of the second order start in the medulla 
and end in the thalamus (of the opposite side). The neurones 
of the third order (the final neurones) start in the thalamus and 
end in the cortex. 
Connection of Cord with Thalamus (and Cortex), Ascend- 
ing Neurones.—Certain of the afferent neurones (spinal roots), 
instead of ascending in the dorsal funieulus (dorsal column), end 
in the posterior horn. The cell body of a central neurone lying 
there sends an axone across the cord (via the ventral commis- 
sure) to the ventral and lateral funiculi of the opposite side, 
forming the two spino-thalamic tracts (Fig. 39, 2 and 6). The 
axones in these tracts carry impulses from the temperature, pain 
and pressure senses. The fibers run directly up to their nuclei of 
reception in the thalamus (ventral and lateral nuclei of the thal- 
amus). In other words, the temperature, pain, pressure pathway 
is relayed once, immediately upon entrance into the cord, and not 
again until the thalamus is reached (Fig. 40). 
Above the level of the medulla they join the medial lemniscus 
and follow the same route as the axones just described, terminat- 
ing probably in adjacent cortical regions (somesthetie area). 
Ascending Pathway of Afferent Cranial Neurones.—The 
afferent root of the V nerve (trigeminus) has its nucleus of 
reception (first relay station) in the gray matter of the pons. 
The reception nucleus is large at this level but tapers down, end- 
ing at the upper level of the spinal cord. The cells in this nucleus 
send axones which, after crossing, probably join the medial 
lemniscus (ascending neurones of the second order) and end in 
the thalamus (Fig. 40). There a second relay occurs and the 
axones from the thalamic cells (ascending neurones of the third 
order) pass up through the internal capsule and corona radiata 
and end in the somesthetic area. It is probable that this ascend- 
ing tract of the V remains fairly distinct from the fibers of the 
lemniscus (in Fig. 40 it is marked trigeminal lemniscus). The 
glossopalatine (afferent portion of VII, n. intermedius) entering 
under the inferior border of the pons (Fig. 31, 24), has its nucleus
-P-A-G-E-175

of reception in the gray matter of the pons. Cells situated there 
send axones into the medial lemniscus to end in the thalamus. 
Neurones beginning there continue the pathway to the somes- 
thetic area. The axones here spoken of carry kinesthetic and

pathway of the glossopalatine axones carrying taste impulses

may possibly run to the thalamus and after being relayed there 
enter the gyrus hippocampus in the basal part of the temporal 
lobe (Fig. 30).

afferent division if the vagus (X) enter the medulla lateral to 
the olive and end in the nucleus tractus solitarii and neighbor- 
ing cells in the medulla. These cells send axones to join the 
lemniscus of the opposite side: they also bear cutaneous, kin- 
zsthetic and org ie impulses. The course of the gustatory ax- 
ones through the brain stem (the glossopharyngeal innervates the 
posterior third of the tongue) and higher structures is likewise 
unknown. 
Course of the Nerves of Special Sense and Their Cortical 
Terminations.—The auditory nerve (cochlear division) enters 
the medulla lateral to the olive (Fig. 31, 25) and ends around 
two reception nuclei in the tuberculum acusticum (Fig. 32). The | 2 mane 5 cells from these nuclei send axones across the mid-line (stria 
medullaris acustica, Fig. 32, 6) and ascend along the sides of the 
medial lemniscus, forming the lateral lewriseus (lemniscus lat- 
eralis). These ascending neurones of the second order end mainly 
in the medial geniculate body of the thalamus (Fig. 32,10). Some 
end undoubtedly in the inferior colliculus (Fig. 32,18). By a 
short system of neurones the pathway of the latter group is con- 
tinued to the medial geniculate body. The third (or, as the case 
may be, the fourth) order of neurones carries them from this point 
through the internal capsule (Fig. 44, 20) to the cortical recep- 
tion station in the temporal lobe (gyri immediately below the 
fissure of Sylvius) (Fig. 35, 4). 
The fibers from the vestibular portion of the eighth nerve 
enter the medulla at a slightly higher level than the cochlear 
branch (Fig. 31, 25). The fibers end around four terminal nuclei 
in the floor and wall of the fourth ventricle: Deiter’s (nucleus 
nervi vestibuli lateralis) situated just internal to the restiform 
body; a superior, Von Bechterew’s (nucleus nervi vestibuli su- 
perior) situated dorsal to Deiter’s nucleus in the lateral wall of 
the fourth ventricle; a medial, Schwalbe’s (nucleus nervi ves- 
tibuli medialis) ; and an inferior (nucleus nervi vestibuli spi- 
nalis). Axones from the lateral and inferior nuclei form paths to 
the spinal cord. Axones from the lateral and superior nuclei 
form a path to the roof nucleus of the cerebellum (nucleus fas- 
tigii) of the opposite side. Apparently there is no thalamic tract 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  NEURO-PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF ACTION 163 
issuing from these nuclei. It would seem that most of the con- 
nections of the vestibular portion of the ear are thus made with 
the cerebellum and cord. 
As was pointed out, the peripheral optic nerve lies in the 
retina (neurones of the first order). The layer of ganglion cells 
with their fibers are ascending neurones of the second order cor- 
responding to the tract running from cerebellum to thalamus in 
the kinesthetic system. These neurones are rightly named the 
optic tract. (tractus opticus) (Fig. 31, 9). The axone system in 
part crosses at the chiasma (Fig. 31,14). From the chiasma the 
fibers enter the brain in the region of the pulvinar of the thal- 
amus. Reaching the pulvinar, the optic tract divides into a

lateral and a mesial branch, The lateral root contains the true 
visual fibers and these fibers end around cells in three regions, 
lateral geniculate body, pulvinar, and in the superior colliculus 
(Fig. 32,11 and17). The latter pathway serves to carry impulses 
(for releasing eye moving reflexes) from the retina to the nuclei 
of motor nerves (III and IV) whose cells of origin lie near. The 
cells in the lateral geniculate body and in the pulvinar send 
axones through the internal capsule to end in the visual cortical 
area—the gyri about the calcarine fissure of the occipital lobe 
(Fig. 33, 17).- 
The olfactory nerve has a very special course. The ganglion 
cells in the olfactory epithelium in the nose send axones (first 
order) to end around the mitral cells in the olfactory bulb (relay   
    Olfactory 
area,
-P-A-G-E-178

station). The mitral cells there send axones known as the olfac- 
tory tract (second order) to enter the hippocampal gyrus in the 
region of the uncus (Fig. 31,20). The system is shown in Fig. 41. 
Summary.—Schematically at any rate, the architecture we 
have been studying is simple enough. All of the tracts in the 
cord bearing cutaneous impulses (occupying ventro-lateral col- 
umns) and kinesthetic impulses (occupying posterior columns) 
from the body are gathered together in the medial lemniscus, 
which ever increases in size from its beginning in the medulla 
due to the addition of fibers coming from reception nuclei of the 
afferent cranial nerves. It is soon joined by the axones from the 
reception nuclei of the auditory nerve (lateral lemniscus). All of 
these axones, including the optic, terminate in nuclei lying in the 
corpora quadrigemina or thalamus. These nuclei send axones di- 
rectly (or by addition of a short central neurone) to the sensory 
projection areas in the cortex, for example, the somesthetic, 
visual and auditory. In this summary we neglect only the olfac- 
tory, which does not appear in any of these levels, and the gusta- 
tory, about whose central connections we know little or nothing. 
Connection of Sensory Projection Areas with the Motor 
Area in the Cortex.—F rom our study of behavior we have found 
that many objects can stimulate more than one sense organ, and 
that when we have learned to respond in a certain way to that 
object, the same response may be initiated by stimulation of any 
one of the sense organs: for example, the stimulation of vision, 
smell, taste or touch effected by an apple may lead to the same 
final movement, the reaching out and grasping of the apple and 
the carrying of it to the mouth. If the formation of habit (ac- 
quired forms of reaction) involves the cortex, then we should 
expect to find that the cortical reception area of each sense organ 
should be in close connection with the cortical motor area. En- 
tirely apart tobe behavior studies it was early established by 
Fritsch while operating upon a wounded soldier in the Franco- 
Prussian War, that if the galvanic-electrie current is applied to 
certain parts of the brain, movement of the limbs occurs. Careful 
experiments during recent years have shown that the pre-central 
gyrus is the main cortical motor area. Stimulation there is fol-

lowed by the contraction of a particular group of muscles on the 
opposite side of the body. The diagrammatic sketch (Fig. 42) 
shows what motor parts are moved. Since we know that the 
peripheral, spinal and cerebral motor neurones run to these 
muscles and directly control them, we may be sure even before we 
examine the architecture that the motor area is connected with 
the cell bodies which give rise to the lower motor neurones. Be- 
tween the motor area or motor projection ‘‘center’’ and the sen- 
sory projection areas lie the so-called association ‘‘centers.’’ 
These areas do not directly receive the final neurones from sense 
organs nor does a weak electrical stimulation arouse muscular

movement. They are the ‘‘silent areas.’’ Entirely too much has 
been made of them (and of the whole localization of function as 
well, page 170). Try to look upon them as more or less non-spe- 
cialized brain areas which contain interconnecting neurones. It 
may be safe to say—it is often said—that every gyrus is con- 
nected with every other gyrus on the same side by association 
neurones and with every gyrus on the opposite side by commis- 
sural neurones (corpus callosum). 
Connection of Cortex with Lower Centers.—Histological 
examination shows that in the precentral gyrus (motor area) 
there exist a large number of giant pyramidal cell bodies on 
each side. The cells are shown in Fig. 43. It has been shown
-P-A-G-E-180
  166 PSYCHOLOGY 
that these giant cells give rise to axones which without relay pass 
to all levels of the spinal cord. Other cells located there send 
axones to the nuclei of origin of the cranial motor nerves. This 
vast system is schematically shown in Fig. 44 and can be 
followed there pass-

of the frontal lobe sends a direct system of axones to the red 
nucleus (nucleus ruber) in the cerebral peduncle (this nucleus 
lies in the tegmentum above the peduncles and just ventral to the

in its turn probably sends up an ascending system of neurones 
which end in the frontal region). We know, furthermore, thai Small pyramidal py’

axones from cells in the frontal, parietal and occipital association

cortico-pontile tracts. Many of the descending pathways are far 
too complicated to study without neurological material.

Descending Tracts in the Spinal Cord.—The pyramidal tract 
is the most conspicuous tract in the cord. At the lower end of 
the medulla the fibers begin to decussate (Fig. 44, 1). After

decussation they take up two positions in the cord. A part of 
the fibers from one motor cortex continue down to the ventral 
funiculus of the same side, the direct pyramidal tract (fasciculus 
cerebro-spinalis anterior) (Fig. 45, 16). The majority of the 
fibers swing over to the opposite side and descend in the lateral 
funiculus, forming the lateral pyramidal tract (fasciculis cere- 
bro-spinalis lateralis) (Fig. 45,11). The direct pyramidal tract 
is soon exhausted. The fibers reach a certain level and turn at 
right angles to end around motor cells in the ventral horn. The

lateral or crossed pyramidal tract can be identified down to the 
lowest level of the cord. As the tract descends it gets smaller 
and smaller, due to the fact that some of the fibers turn at 
right angles to end around motor cells at each successive level. 
The pyramidal neurones and the peripheral motor neurones thus 
together form a very direct path between the motor area in the 
brain and the muscle. 
There are several other descending tracts in the cord. The
-P-A-G-E-183
  NEURO-PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF ACTION 169 
most important ones only are here mentioned. A. Tractus-rubro 
spinalis (von Monakow’s tract) (Fig. 45, 12). This is a tract 
running from the mid-brain (nucleus ruber) to the cord. Its 
fibers terminate in the dorsal portion of the ventral horn. It 
is a joint cerebéllar and thalamic system. Axones of cells in the 
cerebellar cortex run to the nucleus dentatus in the cerebellum: 
cells from this nucleus send axones to end in the nucleus ruber; 
this nucleus in turn sends axones to form the rubro-spinal tract. 
It brings the motor cell in the cord under the influence of the 
thalamus and the cerebellum. B. Tractus vestibulo-spinalis 
(Fig. 45, 15). This tract originates in the reception nuclei of 
the vestibular nerve lying in the medulla—Deiter’s nucleus. It 
was pointed out that this nucleus receives impulses both from the 
cerebellum and from the semicircular canals. The axones in this 
tract also terminate around the ventral horn cell. We thus see 
that there are adequate connections both ascending and descend- 
ing by means of which the cerebellum can serve as an equilibrat- 
ing and toning organ for the muscles. 
A General Caution.—This short sketch of the cerebro-spinal 
system should teach us that every sensory structure studied in 
our last chapter can, when stimulated, excite a segmental reflex, 
a reflex involving neighboring segments, or a reflex involving 
practically the whole of the central nervous system. All of this 
complexity is needed to serve as a neural basis for the complex 
types of reflex, instinctive and habitual acts man performs. We 
shall see when we come to study the motor side of the organism 
that sustained integrated acts such as are involved in eye-hand or 
ear-hand, such as those involved in walking or swimming, require 
that the peripheral motor neurones should be under the influence 
of many distant parts of the central nervous system. While we 
wish to emphasize the importance of the central nervous system, 
we do not wish to make a fetish of it. Due to the studies on the 
localization of function and of the disturbances which occur when 
injury is done to the sensory projection centers in the cortex, 
there has grown up in neurological circles a kind of scientific 
phrenology. The main fact about the central nervous system 
is that it affords a system of connection between sense organs and
-P-A-G-E-184
  170 PSYCHOLOGY 
glands and muscles. Interrupt the pathway in any place and 
the organism no longer acts as a whole; some phase of the be- 
havior pattern will drop out. Nor should the nervous system be 
overemphasized. The whole motor and glandular systems in each 
and every part do the reacting. A sudden stooping or rotation of 
the head, or a loud noise, probably changes the tonus of every 
muscle in the body, striped and unstriped, and starts a wealth of 
glandular activity. But action cannot take place without the 
participation of the bones. Action again means an increased 
food supply, an increased strain upon the heart, and the elim~- 
ination of waste product. A simple eye-hand codrdination, the 
picking up of a pin from the ground, brings about a well-ordered 
and integrated response of the organism as a whole. Such a well- 
ordered response will not take place without a central nervous 
system, but it must be said with equal truth that it will not 
take place without a heart, without bones, and without glands 
and muscles. 
Tue SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SysTEM. 
Introduction.—So far in our discussion of the nervous sys- 
tem we have neglected the sympathetic system, but we have 
spoken of the peripheral motor neurones. The sympathetic sys- 
tem must be looked upon as an extension of the peripheral motor 
nervous system. The peripheral motor nerves belonging to the 
cord and brain are distributed to the striped muscles of the body 
(page 176). But the striped musculature of the skeleton repre- 
sents only a part of the efferent organs. The viscera in the thoracic, 
abdominal and pelvie cavities and certain structures in the head 
region contain unstriped or smooth muscle tissue and glands. 
The sympathetic system which in nearly every case is under: the 
dominion of the motor nerves of the cord and brain controls the 
smooth muscles of the viscera and glands. The sympathetic is 
thus wholly motor. Afferent neurones are distributed to the 
tissue which the sympathetic controls, but these afferent neurones 
belong to the afferent peripheral cerebro-spinal system which we 
have already studied—the organic sense organ. There is no sub- 
stantial evidence to show that the sympathetic system has an 
afferent supply of its own. It may be true from an evolutionary  
-P-A-G-E-185
NEURO-PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF ACTION 171 
  point of view that the cerebro-spinal system is an adjunct to the 
sympathetic, but the development of the former has reached such 
a point that it now is the ‘‘tail that wags the dog.”” There has 
been a tendency in recent years to exploit the sympathetic system 
at the expense of the cerebro-spinal. This has been done largely 
in the interest of giving a neurophysiological basis to certain 
psychoanalytic principles. When one considers the enormous 
development of language habits and of the vast system of integra- 
tions existing among the reflex ares controlling the striped muscu- 
lature of the body as a whole, one cannot take such a view seri- 
ously, even though he himself is prepared to yield an ever-in- 
creasing importance to the system. Emotional activity is impor- 
tant, hunger, thirst, micturition, defecation are also important 
factors, as we have tried to show—especially when disturbances 
in those mechanisms occur. But after all the sympathetic 
mechanisms which underlie such functions are simply a part of 
the body as a whole. To overemphasize it is to neglect our facts 
in the interest of theory. 
The Ganglia of the Sympathetic (or Autonomic) System.— 
Fig. 27 shows (in black, on right side only) (1) a chain of sym- 
pathetic ganglia that run parallel on each side of the spinal cord. 
The ganglia appear on each of these trunks at fairly regular in- 
tervals. Each trunk runs from the second cervical vertebra to 
the first piece of coccyx. The two trunks unite in one ganglion 
at the coceyx—the ganglion coceygeum impar. It will be under- 
stood that these ganglia, as do all other sympathetic ganglia, lie 
wholly outside of the central nervous system. (2) The cephalic 
or brain portion of the sympathetic consists of four main ganglia 
on each side, but not appearing in regular segments as do those 
considered above—the ciliary ganglion (ciliary muscle in the eye, 
sphincter of the iris, ete.), sphenopalatine (vaso-motor, secre- 
tory), the optic (vaso-motor, etc.) and the submaxillary (glands of 
mouth, ete.). There are also numerous other small ganglia. 
These ganglia are not shown. (3) Ganglia scattered through 
the visceral organs, in the cavities of the thorax, abdomen and 
pelvis—the heart, lungs, liver, alimentary tract, pancreas and 
sex organs. The most important of these ganglia are found in
-P-A-G-E-186
172 PSYCHOLOGY 
  connection with the cardiac plexus, cceliac (solar) plexus and the 
hypogastric plexus (abdominal and pelvic). None of these is 
shown in our drawings. 
Structure of the Sympathetic Ganglia—The ganglia consist 
of gray matter, cell bodies giving rise to axones, and of ends of 
axones coming from other neurones. The axones of the sympa- 
thetie are rarely myelinated throughout their course, but they 
are occasionally myelinated for a short distance after leaving the 
cell body. Most of the axones are covered with a sheath of 
Schwann. The dendrites are numerous and similar in structure 
to those we have studied in the central nervous system. 
Distribution of Sympathetic Neurones.—The axones of 
sympathetic neurones, after a shorter or longer course, end 
finally in the glandular tissue, in the heart muscle, in the blood- 
vessels, and in the non-striated muscular tissue of the body 
wherever it is found. We see the system in action in the bristling 
of hairs, dilatation and constriction of the pupil, secretion of 
saliva, inhibition and acceleration of the heart, flushing, goose- 
flesh, peristalsis, defecation, urination, tumescence in the sex 
organs, ete. Sympathetic neurones thus are motor and control 
the so-called vegetative functions. 
The Control of the Central Nervous System Over the Sym- 
pathetic System.—The neural connection of the central nervous 
' system with sympathetic ganglia is shown in Fig. 46. It is seen 
there that cell bodies in the gray matter of the cord (lateral 
horn), and this is true also of the brain, send out axones 
through the motor roots, which end in a near or distant sym- 
pathetic ganglion. The synaptical connection is like that in the 
central nervous system. The axone breaks up into an end brush 
and ends around the dendrites of the sympathetic neurone. The 
neurone (Fig. 46, 8) running from the spinal cord or brain to 
the sympathetic ganglia and ending there is called the pre-gan- 
qlonic neurone (the axone is also called the pre-ganglionie axone 
or fiber). This pre-ganglionic neurone is myelinated and is 
similar in all respects to motor neurones with the possible excep- 
tion of its size; in general it is slightly smaller. The sympathetic 
neurone (Fig. 46, 5) running from the ganglion cell to end in the
-P-A-G-E-187
NEURO-PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF ACTION 173 
gland or smooth muscle tissue is called usually the post-ganglionic 
neurone. We thus see that the whole sympathetic nervous sys- 
tem is under the control of the central nervous system by means 
of the pre-ganglionic neurone. 
(The white ramus communicans consists of pre-ganglionic 
axones on their way to enter a sympathetic ganglion. There is 
also a gray ramus communicans consisting largely of axones of

sympathetic neurones which must get out of the visceral cavity 
in order to run to the sweat glands of the skin, the muscles of the 
hairs and blood-vessels. These post-ganglionic fibers join the 
spinal nerves and run a common course with them.) 
The Afferent or Return Connections of the Sympathetic.— 
Notwithstanding the work of Dogiel and Huber and others, more 
recent investigations show that the sympatheti¢ has no afferent 
system of its own. The peripheral afferent system of the brain 
and cord (spinal and cranial ganglia) affords the sensory inner- 
vation for the tissues controlled by the sympathetic. The periph- 
eral process from a spinal or cerebral ganglion cell, instead of 
running towards the skin or kinesthetic structures, turns to enter
-P-A-G-E-188
  174 PSYCHOLOGY 
the white ramus and pass along with the pre-ganglionic fiber. 
But instead of ending in a sympathetic ganglion, where the pre- 
ganglionic fiber ends, it passes through or alongside of the gan- 
glion without making functional connections and ends in the 
motor or glandular tissue that is under the control of the post- 
ganglionic or sympathetic fiber. This is the usual relation. Pos- 
sibly an illustration will make this clearer. The sweetheart of 
a boy comes suddenly into the room. His face flushes. The neural 
» situation in outline is as follows: The optic impulses pass back 
over the optic tract and upon reaching the central system arouse 
an impulse in pre-ganglionic neurones. These neurones carry 
the impulse to the sympathetic neurones which dilate the blood- 
vessels of the face. But this sudden change in the temperature 
of the face arouses the ordinary nerve endings in the skin which 
are sensitive to warmth, ete. In the viscera the conditions are 
probably not at all different. 
Divisions of the Sympathetic System.—Most authors divide 
the sympathetic as a whole into two divisions, oftentimes into 
more. The most recent and satisfactory division seems to be as fol- 
lows (Ranson): (1) The thoracico-lumbar autonomic system is 
that division of the sympathetic the pre-ganglionie fibers of which 
make their exit from the spinal cord. through the thoracic and 
upper lumbar nerves. (2) The craniosacral autonomic system is 
that division of the sympathetic system the pre-ganglionie fibers 
of which make their exit from the cerebro-spinal axis (brain and 
yord) through the III, VII, IX, X, XI cranial nerves and the 
II, III and IV sacral nerves. Most of the structures innervated 
by the autonomic system receive a double supply, a portion from 
part 1 above and a portion from part 2. When this occurs the two 
sets possess opposite functions; for example: autonomic system 
1 dilates the pupil, while autonomic system 2 contracts it; again, 
autonomic 1 increases secretion in the submaxillary gland, auto- 
nomic 2 decreases it. Finally, autonomic 1 accelerates the heart, 
autonomie 2 inhibits it. 
Concluding Statements.—Although the material presented in 
this chapter has possibly seemed detailed we have done little more 
than present the elementary conduction systems which connect
-P-A-G-E-189
NEURO-PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF ACTION 175 
the sense organs with the central nervous system and the latter 
with the muscles and glands. We have had to leave out of account 
all discussion of the special functions of the cerebral cortex, thal- 
amus, caudate nucleus, nucleus lentiformis, the cerebellum, and 
the gray cellular masses in the brain stem. If what has been pre- 
sented has been followed, the student should carry away with 
him an increased knowledge of what kinwsthetic motor responses, 
visual-motor responses, and organic-motor responses are, and 
what is meant by the integration or tying together of long and 
short reflex ares in such a way that concerted, controlled and sus- 
tained action in the muscles may be obtained. This knowledge is 
fundamental if the factors underlying human behavior are sought. 
The sympathetic system should not be confusing. Every 
sense organ is the beginning of an are which ends in a muscle. 
The organic sense organ is no exception. The afferent. portion of 
this system is similar in all respects to that of the kinesthetic or 
cutaneous, but on the motor side it takes both the pre-ganglionic 
neurone and the post-ganglionic (sympathetic) neurone to estab- 
lish connections with the effectors. In other words, the pre-gan- 
glionic neurone belonging to the central system has to be 
“‘lengthened’’ or ‘‘supplemented’’ in order to reach and stimu- 
late the motor organs belonging to the organic system. This is, 
of course, an oversimplification in the interest of making the ana- 
tomical relation clear. Whether neural action in neurones be- 
longing to the sympathetic system is in all respects similar to 
neural action elsewhere is a problem which we need not attempt 
to study here.

CHAPTER V 
  THE ORGANS OF RESPONSE: MUSCLES AND GLANDS 
Introduction.—In order to complete our sketch of the mechan- 
isms involved in human response, it remains for us to study the 
effectors. So far we have studied receptors or sense organs and 
their stimuli, and the system of conductors stretching out between 
receptors and the effectors, or acting organs. The motor neurones 
of the cord and brain end directly in skeletal muscle or indirectly 
(through the intermediation of a sympathetic post-ganglionic 
neurone, page 173) in the smooth muscles of the body and 
the glands. Our sketch would be incomplete if we failed to get 
a good working notion of action in skeletal muscles. smooth 
muscles, and glands. In the sketch which follows we have omitted 
all details and have summarized only the most important features 
of such action, and the features with which psychology has most 
to do. We can study the effector system under three general 
divisions: I, the striped muscles; II, the smooth muscles; III, 
the glands. 
I. Srrep Muscuzs. 
Structure of the Striped Muscles.—The skeletal or striped 
muscles constitute the principal mass of the body as a whole. 
Each muscle is more or less of an organic whole, which can 
assume various shapes and sizes. The morphological unit of a 
muscle, however, is a muscle fiber or muscle cell. Each muscle 
consists of a large number of thread-like cells which usually lie 
parallel to the long axis of the muscle. At one or both ends, the 
muscle tapers down and forms a junction with a tendon. The 
tendons in turn are attached to the bone. The fibers of the 
muscles are grouped into larger and smaller bundles, each bundle 
being bound with connective tissue. A sheath, or perimysium, 
surrounds the muscle as a whole. 
The individual muscle fibers vary greatly in diameter and 
length. They are rarely longer than 36 mm., and the diameter 
varies from 0.1 to 0.01 mm. The fibers are cylindrical in shape. 
176 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
  ORGANS OF RESPONSE 177 
Bach fiber is inclosed in a thin homogeneous elastic membrane 
called the sarcolemma. The material inside the fiber is striated. 
It is supposed to be of a semi-viscous consistency. This material 
is the muscle plasma. The muscle plasma is made up of fibrils 
which run the whole length of the intervening sarcoplasm. The 
fibrils seem to be made up of alternating dim and light dises. 
Neural Endings in Muscles.—The peripheral motor and sen- 
sory neurones end in the muscles. We have already spoken of the 
  Fra, 47.—Ending of motor nerves in striped muscle, The axones pierce the perimysium, lose their medullary sheath and end in a plate-like formation on the individual muscle fibers. (Piersol’s Anatomy.) 
sensory endings in muscles on page 59. The axones of the motor 
nerves upon reaching the muscle lose their medullary sheath and 
break up into numerous fine fibrils. These fibrils spread out in 
plate form (motor end plates) and pass to each muscle fiber. Fig. 
47 shows the ending in striped muscle fibers of axones of efferent 
neurones. 
In addition to the afferent and efferent supply coming from 
the central nervous system, the muscles receive sympathetic 
fibers, 1.€., the axones of post-ganglionic neurones end in the 
12
-P-A-G-E-192
178 PSYCHOLOGY 
  muscle. The function of the sympathetic neurones there, how- 
ever, seems to be that of controlling the blood supply to the 
muscles.* 
Relations of Muscles to Bones and fendons, etc.—The bones 
of the body, about 200 in number, are the passive organs in reac- 
tion. The muscles are the active organs. The bones are more or 
less rigid structures, well adapted to their function, combining 
the maximum amount of rigidity with the least amount of weight. 
All of the long bones are hollow and filled with a substance rich 
in fat. The bones are united rigidly, as those of the skull, or else 
in a way to permit movement the one upon the other. The bones 
united by cartilages are semi-mobile, for example, the bones of the 
pelvis, ribs and vertebre. The bones united by articular cap- 
sules are semi-mobile, mobile or very mobile, as the elbow, knee, 
shoulder and hip. In the true articulations the heads of the 
bones are covered with a large cartilage to which is attached the 
fibrous articular capsule which connects the two bones. External 
to the capsule lie the strong protective ligaments. In each cap- 
sule there are epithelial cells which secrete the synovia, a trans- 
parent viscous mass which lubricates the articular surfaces. 
Most skeletal muscles have tendons at each end. The tendons 
end in two contiguous bones. The majority of the muscles thus 
cross one joint. Whenever this condition is met we have a lever. 
The skeleton is built up of a vast number of such levers. When- 
ever the organ moved must have speed but needs to overcome but 
little resistance, the force is supplied to the shorter arm of the 
lever ; whenever, on the contrary, speed is not essential, but great 
force is required, the power is applied to the longer arm. An 
example of the first case is a movement of the forearm; of the 
second case, the raising of the body upon the toes. For all the 
finer movements of the more mobile parts of the body there are 
both flexor muscles and extensor muscles. These two are antag- 
onistic. The one will flex or bend the arm, for example, at the 
  
+Hunt maintains that the sympathetic fibers also go to the muscle 
plasm. Kempf and also White have accepted this extremely problematical 
conclusion, and have tremendously overemphasized the importance of the 
sympathetic system.

elbow; the other will straighten it out, extend it. Since both 
muscles are elastic and always under tension, the mobile organ is 
always delicately balanced. <A slight impulse to the flexor draws 
the arm up smoothly, and a slight impulse to the extensor will 
straighten it just as smoothly. It has been shown that whenever a 
motor impulse goes to a flexor causing its contraction, there goes 
also a neural impulse to the extensor muscle causing it to 
lengthen or relax. Likewise, when the extensor is contracted the 
flexor is relaxed. The muscles around a joint are thus set in 
opposed groups, one group relaxing while the other contracts. 
The Nature of Muscular Activity—In normal reaction the

muscle is contracted (shortened) by a neural impulse passing to 
it over its own motor nerve. The muscle itself, however, is irri- 
table, as is shown by the fact that when separated from its nerve 
supply it can be made to contract by a stimulus applied directly 
to it. It can be aroused by a blow, by a sudden change in tem- 
perature, by chemical stimuli and by electrical stimuli. The elec- 
trical stimuli are most convenient to use.” 
Simple Contraction.—The contraction of a muscle to a single 
stimulus shows three phases; a schematic tracing is shown in 
  
* By irritability is meant that a tissue can be made to exhibit its own 
particular form of activity. whenever and however it is stimulated; e.g., 
the muscle cells contract no matter how stimulated, whereas the gland cells 
when stimulated secrete.
-P-A-G-E-194
  180 PSYCHOLOGY 
Fig. 48. The muscle is stimulated electrically at a, it begins to 
contract at b, reaches the apex of contraction at c, begins to relax 
rapidly, then more slowly, becoming normally relaxed at d. The 
time line is indicated below the curve. The interval from a to b 
is (1) the latent period. Although stimulated, no movement can 
be observed. The time of the latent period is very short, possibly 
not over 0.005 see. It varies greatly in the different muscles. 
The condition the muscle is in also causes it to vary, as do tem- 
perature, fatigue and the load the muscle has to raise. 
The interval b-c is (2) the phase of the shortening. The 
muscle shortens at first slowly, then rapidly, then more slowly. 
This interval is about 0.04 sec. 
The interval c-d is (3) the elongation or relaxation phase. 
Relaxation is rapid at first and then slows down. This interval is 
about 0.05 see. A good many factors alter the time of these last 
two phases. Temperature affects both the shortening and relaxa- 
tion phases. At 0° C. the muscle loses its irritability; at about 
9° C. the contraction phase is high. From there it falls off slightly, 
then begins to increase again at 18° C., becoming maximal at 30°C. 
The contractions then die out, heat rigor taking place at 37° C. or 
above. In no case does the muscle (or other protoplasmic tissue) 
withstand a temperature higher than 45° C. The duration of con- 
traction is prolonged by low temperatures. As the temperature 
rises the duration of the contraction as a whole decreases until at 
18° C. it becomes constant. Certain drugs greatly affect the sim- 
ple contraction. The alkaloid veratrin has the following effect: 
(1) The phase of shortening is not altered, but the phase of relaxa- 
tion is much prolonged. After the height of the shortening has 
been reached there is a brief relaxation, followed by a second 
slower contraction. 
We discussed on page 119 the relation of strength of stimulus 
to response in nerve tissue. We found that in the nerve the ‘‘all- 
or-none law’’ seemed to hold and we mentioned the fact there 
that it held in the muscle as well. If a single muscle fiber is con- 
tracted it contracts to its full capacity; increase of stimulus 
merely brings more muscle fibers into operation. As soon as all are 
stimulated the response of the muscle is maximal. Gradation of
-P-A-G-E-195
ORGANS OF RESPONSE 181 
muscular activity is thus brought about by the number of fibers at 
work and not by the intensity of the stimulation. 
Effect of Repeated Contraction —If instead of stimulating 
the muscle with a single induction shock we give it repeated stim- 
ulations all equal in intensity and equally spaced in time, we find 
that the first contraction (shortening phase) is highest, then there 
follows a decrease for about four contractions. The muscle de- 
creases slightly in irritability ; irritability then increases and the 
shortening increases again for some time. The effect of activity 
is thus beneficial to the muscle. After a time under repeated 
stimulation, the muscle begins again steadily to lose its irritabil- 
ity. The height of contraction becomes less and less. Finally the 
muscle ceases to shorten. This condition is known as ‘‘fatigue.’’ 
Tetanic Contraction—Most muscular responses brought 
about by the action of motor neurones are unlike the simple 
twitch we have thus far studied. The impulses come so rapidly 
that the muscles cannot react to them separately. There is no 
time for relaxation. The muscle then contracts and stays per- 
manently in that phase as long as the stimulus endures. This is 
called compound contraction or tetanus. It can be produced in 
the laboratory by sending in separate electrical shocks very rap- 
idly to the muscle. The number of stimuli per second required to 
produce tetanus varies with the muscle and with the species of 
animal from which the muscle is taken. Twenty to thirty stimuli 
are required for mammalian muscles. Of course, all of the con- 
ditions mentioned above which tend to slow the relaxation phase 
tend to produce tetanus with less frequency of stimulus. 
Summation of Stimuli—The most interesting phenomenon 
to be observed in compound contraction or tetanus is summation. 
If conditions are so arranged that a second impulse strikes the 
muscle just at the instant that it is most shortened, it will still 
further shorten. If three instead of two stimuli are thus properly 
timed, a still further shortening will occur. It thus becomes pos- 
sible in a muscle completely tetanized to obtain two to three times 
the extent of shortening that can be obtained in the simple twitch.

tivity, boxing, swimming, tapping, for example, is there a com-

pound contraction, tetanus, or a simple twitch? Most movements 
of this character are so long continued that they must be of the 
tetanus type. It has been recently shown that even the most 
rapid trills that can be made upon a musical instrument are of 
this type. How do sufficient impulses reach the muscles to pro- 
duce tetanus? Investigation shows that the motor nerve has its 
own rhythm of discharge. When a muscle is in tetanic contrac-

tion the separate impulses do not observably change its form, but 
under such conditions the muscle (1) emits a musical note which 
has a frequency that within certain limits corresponds to the fre- 
quency of the impulses reaching it. The same phenomenon can be 
detected by the string galvanometer. The number of impulses 
reaching the striped muscles in habit contraction varies with the 
muscle—from 47 in the flexor of the arm to 100 in the masseter 
(jaw). The various motor cells of the central nervous system 
thus have very different rates of discharge. If the frequency of 
the impulses reaching the muscles is greater than the above, the 
muscle cannot keep in step. It, however, maintains its intrin- 
sie rhythm. 
Muscular Work.—Fig. 49 shows the ergograph, an instru-

ment by means of which we can study graphically the curve of 
work of certain muscular organs. 
Fig. 50 shows the curve of work of the flexors of the middle 
finger of the right hand, lifting a load of three kilograms at in- 
tervals of two seconds. This curve is usually called a fatigue 
curve. It will be noticed that the height to which the load is 
raised is great at first, that it decreases rapidly for a time, then

much more slowly, decreasing very rapidly thereafter until 
fatigue results. If now the load is lightened the muscle again 
is capable of doing work. The ergograph thus does not afford a 
means of completely determining the amount of work a muscle 
can do. Certain interesting facts have been obtained with the 
ergograph: (1) If a sufficient rest period is allowed after each 
contraction, no fatigue occurs; (2) after complete fatigue with 
a given load, a rest of two hours is required for the muscle’s com- 
plete recovery ; (3) if after complete fatigue abortive contractions
-P-A-G-E-198
  184 PSYCHOLOGY 
are continued for some time, the period of rest must be much 
longer than two hours. This shows the deleterious effect of at- 
tempting to continue much muscular activity in a fatigued con- 
dition; (4) loss of sleep, hunger, and anemia of the muscles 
lower the amount of work which can be done; (5) improved cir- 
culation produced by massage, better foods and sugar solutions 
increase the muscular work; (6) the total amount of work done 
is greater with small loads than with large; (7) fatigue of one 
set of muscles, for example, those in the leg, will decrease the 
amount of work which can be obtained from another muscle due 
to the circulation of fatigue products in the blood. 
Muscle Tone.—We have several times spoken of muscle tone. 
This is poorly understood in physiology. That a muscle is never 
fully relaxed in the normal state appears from the fact that when 
the muscle is cut the two ends draw away from each other. Tone 
in both flexors and extensors is generally supposed to be due to a 
reflex through the central nervous system (without assistance of 
sympathetic neurones). It is supposed that when the muscle 
relaxes to a certain point, afferent endings in the muscle are stim- 
ulated. These in turn arouse motor impulses in the central 
nervous system which pass directly to the motor end plates and 
are distributed to each motor fiber. Certain authors have recently 
suggested that the sympathetic system contributes the tone: that 
the answering impulses to the afferent stream from the muscle 
goes out from the cord over the pre-ganglionie fibers, then to the 
post-ganglionic (sympathetic) and to the muscle. Sectioning of 
the white rami is said to destroy muscle tone. The whole matter 
is still a research problem. 
Fatigue Products—When an individual exercises, CO, is 
given out by the muscle. It is absorbed into the blood stream, 
carried to the lungs and then given off in the expired air. Twice 
as much CO, is given off on a working day as on a resting day. 
The further products as a result of activity are lactic acid (de- 
rived probably from sugar, the sugar in turn being obtained from 
the glycogen), and possibly acid potassium phosphate. If ex- 
tracts are made from the muscles of a fatigued animal and admin- 
istered to a rested animal, the latter shows signs of fatigue.

‘ Functioning of Reflex Arcs: The “Final Common Path”.— 
We have on page 133 already touched upon reflex action. Now 
that we have studied all of the elements comprising a reflex are, 
it would be well to consider a little more closely some of the 
phenomena which appear when reflex ares function. From our 
survey of the sense organ structures, it becomes clear that there 
are many more points where afferent impulses can be aroused 
than there are separate motor outlets. Indeed, a count of axones 
shows that there are about five afferent neurones to one efferent 
(cerebro-spinal axis as a whole). Hence we must look upon each 
motor neurone as the possible outlet for impulses aroused at many 
different sensory points on the bodily surfaces. It is the sole 
outlet, the final common path for impulses*which are on their 
way to the muscle in which the given motor neurone ends. Cer- 
tain consequences result from this relationship. Two sensory 
impulses aroused at points a and b upon a sensory surface might 
pass out over a common path to a given muscle, but the impulse 
aroused at a if acting alone might excite one type of motor re- 
sponse, say, a contraction of the flexors, whereas that aroused 
at b if acting alone might excite the muscle to act in a wholly 
different way, for example, produce the contraction of the ex- 
tensors. Obviously both flexion and extension of the leg do not 
and cannot occur at the same time. What usually occurs is that 
either the one or the other reflex appears; or if both flexor and 
extensor muscles do contract trembling will occur. In observing 
the behavior of others, we see their separate acts taking place 
in an orderly way, although we know it is not usual for one 
stimulus to begin to act at the moment another ceases to act. 
A host of stimuli act concurrently, but the organism reacts now 
to one, now to another, depending upon which group of stimuli 
becomes prepotent. To give the reasons for now the one, now the 
other group of stimuli becoming prepotent is to give an outline 
of the whole of physiology and psychology. Although we can- 
not profitably discuss this question, it is possible for us to examine 
certain close relations existing among different reflex ares. 
Allied Reflex Arcs.—Certain reflexes combine harmoniously, 
being mutually reinforcing reactions. This can be shown most 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
186 PSYCHOLOGY 
  easily in the scratch reflex of the dog (Sherrington). If at the 
moment the scratch reflex is being elicited by stimulation of a 
skin point on the shoulder, another point 10 em. distant is stim- 
ulated, the result is favorable to the action already in progress. 
If the two stimuli are each made just subliminal so that the 
reflex cannot be obtained by stimulating either the one or the 
other of the skin points, the reflex can be obtained by simulta- 
neously stimulating the two points. The greater the similarity 
in the type of action each stimulus separately applied would call 
out, the greater the reinforcement when both stimuli are applied 
simultaneously. We may look upon the whole skin area (or skin 
and kinesthetic area) from which variations of the same reflex 
can be obtained as the receptive field of the reflex. These recep- 
tive fields are quite extended. In the scratch reflex, the different 
points in the receptive field when touched all produce variations 
in the scratching reaction. Such reflexes are called type reflexes. 
There is thus a completely harmonious relationship existing 
among all of the separate reflexes comprising a given type. 
Antagonistic Reflexes.—Many of the reflexes which can be 
aroused by the use of the same common path are thus allied. 
But many ares are antagonistic when functioning. If while the 
scratch reflex is in progress with the left foot, due to a stimula- 
tion of a skin point of the left shoulder, the right foot is stimu- 
lated, the scratch movement is halted. Depending upon the time 
relations of the stimuli, the contact applied to the right foot can 
interrupt the scratch reflex, cut it short or delay its progress. 
The stimulus to the right foot does not have to be very intense 
in order to produce this result. We have here an example of 
interference between two reflexes. The final common path used 
by the seratch reflex is used also by the reflex elicitable from the 
right foot. The latter reflex has as a result extension at the left 
knee. In other words, stimulation of the right foot arouses the 
extensors at the left knee and simultaneously inhibits the flexors. 
The scratch reflex involves a rhythmical use of the flexor neurones. 
There is thus a definite conflict in use of the flexors. The scratch 
reflex involves them in action four times per second, whereas the 
stimulus from the right foot would block action in them altogether.
-P-A-G-E-201
ORGANS OF RESPONSE 187 
The Knee Jerk in Man.—Entirely aside from the subject of 
allied and antagonistic refiexes the fact is worth considering that 
apparently any form of reflex action taking place under the im- 
pulse of a given stimulus may and probably is altered by the 
presence of another stimulus if the application of the latter is 
timed with respect to that of the first. This can be illustrated by 
the reflex knee jerk, which occurs when the tendon is struck. If the 
extent of the jerk of the leg is being measured, it will be found 
that blowing upon the eye, or squeezing a dynamometer with 
the hand at the instant that the blow is struck on the tendon 
augments the extent of the jerk. If the reinforcing action (or 
stimulus) precedes the blow on the tendon by too great an inter- 
val, the extent of the jerk is decreased: there is inhibition. 
Inhibition begins to appear when the reinforcing act (squeezing 
the dynamometer with the hand, for example) precedes the blow 
on the tendon by .22 sec. to .6 sec.; the maximum inhibiting 
effect is obtained at from .66 to .9 sec. If the interval is greater, 
inhibition becomes less noticeable. At 1.7 sec. to 2.5 sec., the 
reinforcing stimulus has no effect. 
Latent Time in Reflex Arcs.—After a reflex are has con- 
ducted an impulse, it shows a resting or unstimulable phase for 
a short time. Stimuli impinging upon the afferent nerve endings 
will no longer excite the muscle. This is known as latent refiex 
time. It seems to be never longer than one second or thereabouts. 
It is sometimes much shorter ; in the knee jerk, 10c; in the reflex 
eyelid closure, 45c. 
General Considerations——This completes our survey of the 
efferent motor control of the system of skeletal muscles. We have 
entered somewhat into the details of reflex action in order that. 
we may have before us some of the factors which may later on 
throw light upon the phenomena we meet with in instinct and 
in habit. We have gained in the various parts of the text some 
little insight into such physiological factors as (1) fatigue in 
cell body and possibly in axones; (2) the nature of simple and 
tetanic contractions in muscles (latent period, shortening and 
relaxation phases, and summation of stimuli) ; (3) the nature of 
work, fatigue and fatigue products in the muscles, and finally  
-P-A-G-E-202
  188 PSYCHOLOGY 
  (4) the nature of simple allied and antagonistic reflex action. 
If there were space at our disposal, we should find it helpful to 
consider the compounding of reflexes, codrdination of reflexes, 
and the so-called laws of reflex action. The final explanation of 
many of these topics in sensory physiology is still in question, 
but most of the phenomena actually appear in the behavior of 
organisms, whatever their final explanation in terms of neural 
action may be. We cannot apply in detail all of the data we have 
gained from this study. Man’s acts from day to day are too 
complicated. We see him running to catch his train, tossing 
pennies to his newsboy, speaking fluently, meeting his family, 
playing, painting, building and running mechanical contrivances. 
It does help us not a little in observing these acts to have some 
insight into the factors we have studied, even though we cannot 
put our finger from moment to moment upon a reinforcement, 
an inhibition, or action in a partially fatigued group of muscles. 
II. Tae Nature anp Function or Smoorn Muscin 
The most important area of unstriped muscle(is to be found 
in connection, with the alimentary canal and the other visceral 
    
       
Fra, 51,—Showing smooth muscle cells arranged to form a membrane. (From Piersol’s ‘Anatomy.) 
organs. The gross divisions of the alimentary canal are the 
mouth, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, the small and the large 
intestine. The unstriped muscular tissue is to be found mainly 
in the lower portion of the esophagus and throughout the stom- 
ach, the large and the small intestines. These latter’ structures 
have (1) an inner lining of epithelial cells supported by a fibrous 
tunic and a thin layer of smooth muscle, (2) a muscular coat com- 
posed of two layers of smooth muscle, one circular and the other 
longitudinal; this muscular layer propels the contents along the 
canal, and (3) an outer fibrous coat (several subsidiary coats are

not given). Smooth muscle is found almost exclusively in the 
veins and arteries throughout the body, in the bronchi, in the 
genital and urinary organs, and to some extent in the skin 
(muscles attached to hairs, ducts of sweat glands, for examples). 
The structure of the smooth muscle differs markedly from the 
striated. It consists of minute spindle-shaped cells (Fig. 51) 
with a single nucleus. These cells generally unite to form mem- 
branes as in the intestines. Fig. 52 shows 
the details of the construction of the 
nucleus. 
The Nerve Supply of Smooth Mus- 
cles.—In general the smooth muscles are 
under the control of the sympathetic sys- 
tem, that is, of the post-ganglionic 
neurones (page 170). They can also, as 
will be shown later,/be stimulated to action 
by secretion from the ductless glands, and 
by other chemical agents. They are thus 
under two forms of control: under a 
nervous control, and a secretion control. 
The endings of the post-ganglionie neu- 
rone are like those shown in Fig. 46, but 
the afferent_endings have not been surely 
  Hi 5 é Fic. 52,—Showing details of differentiated from the sympathetic. The nucleus of smooth muscle cells. - . *. < (From Piersol’s Anatomy.) 
endings at times are quite complicated. 
Attention is called to the fact that several of the efferent neu- 
rones of the brain and cord are (apparently) distributed to the 
visceral organs controlled by the smooth muscles. It is generally 
supposed that these pre-ganglionic neurones of the central sys- 
tem are never distributed directly to smooth muscles fibers or 
glands (the adrenal gland being possibly an exception). They 
end in the various plexuses around cell bodies of post-ganglionic 
neurones (sympathetic ganglia). Emerging from these plexuses 
are the post-ganglionic neurones which control the bladder, sex 
organs, and the contraction and dilatation of the intestines. 
Importance of the Action of Smooth Muscles.—A little ob- 
servation shows that the vegetative life of the organism is con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
190 PSYCHOLOGY 
trolled. by smooth muscle. Its integrity and smooth working 
condition all of the functions of the organism as a whole. We 
have emphasized certain of these factors on page 66. 
Contraction in Smooth—Muscles.—Speaking broadly, the 
general phenomena of contraction already discussed in connec- 
tion with the skeletal muscles appear here. The most important 
difference is that of sluggishness in the changes. The latent 
period in smooth muscle is long, sometimes 100 to 500 times 
longer than in striped muscle. The phases of shortening and 
relaxation are also prolonged, summation effects appear as well as 
tetanic contractions. It maintains any tone given to it for a 
much longer period of time than striped muscle. Intestinal 
muscles show rapid increase in tone upon little stimulation, par- 
ticularly when evoked by chemical stimuli, and maintain it 
against pronounced resistance with slight production of heat. 
They show, under proper conditions of stimulation, rhythmic 
activity. . This is seen in the hunger contractions, in the ureters, 
and in the bladder. 
III. Guanps anp THEIR ACTIONS. 
In addition to the skeletal muscles and the smooth muscles, 
there is another group of effectors or expressive organs—the 
glands. These organs are fundamental to animal existence, since 
they play the principal réle in the digestion of food and in the 
control and the regulation of growth and metabolism (secretion), 
and in the elimination of certain waste products of the body 
(exeretion). While each cell in the body must abstract from the 
blood and lymph its own nutrient material and give off its own 
waste products, still in all complex animal forms certain cells 
are grouped in the glands which either secrete certain substances 
for the use of other organs, or else eliminate waste products 
from the bodily fiuid. There are many scattering groups of cells 
which perform these functions for the body as a whole that are 
not grouped into glandular structures, but we shall have to 
neglect any lengthy discussion of them and confine our survey 
to the most important and largest of the gland structures. We 
may divide glands into (a) duct-glands, which have a well- 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
ORGANS OF RESPONSE 191 
marked opening or outlet through which their products are deliv- 
ered, and (b) ductless-glands, which have no outlets. Their 
secretion is absorbed directly into the blood stream and is dis- 
tributed by it to other bodily tissues. 
  A, THE DUCT-GLAND (EXTERNAL SECRETION). 
The duct-glands were studied earlier than the ductless-glands, 
and their action was thought to be better understood. Recent 
investigation has thrown a great deal of light upon the action 
of these glands and new points of view have been obtained. It is 
now generally recognized that their activity is very complex 
indeed. There are so many problems connected with the action 
of duct-glands that we can survey only certain features which 
are at the present moment of most interest to objective psychol- 
ogy. Due largely to the work on animals carried out by Pavlow 
and his students in Russia, and to that of Lashley on man in this 
country (page 30), it has been found that the action of certain 
duet-glands can be profoundly modified by habit influences. 
The Salivary Glands.—The principal glands which at pres- 
ent have been found to show this influence (conditioned reflex) 
are the glands of the stomach and the three pairs of glands in 
the mouth cavity—the parotid, the sublingual and the submax- 
illary. The latter three pairs of glands are shown in Fig. 53. 
They manufacture and secrete jointly the fiuid called saliva, 
which they pour directly through ducts into the mouth cavity. 
The saliva is thus the first digestive fluid with which the food 
comes into contact. These glands are made up of several types of 
secreting cells (epithelial). Contained in the glands besides the 
secreting cells are blood-vessels, connective tissue, smooth muscle 
tissue and nerve endings. The nerve supply is complex. The 
motor neurones actually ending in the glands are post-ganglionic, 
but the pre-ganglionic fibers belong to both autonomic systems 
(thoracico-lumbar autonomic and cranio-sacral autonomic). 
There are, too, medullated afferent endings present (cerebro- 
spinal). The glands are excited usually reflexly (normal 
reflex) by food substances coming into contact with the lining of 
the mouth. They seem to possess in addition to their function,
-P-A-G-E-206
  192 PSYCHOLOGY 
as digestive organs a certain protective function. Small pieces 
of rock fail to excite the glands, but if the rock is powdered, 
copious fluid appears which apparently makes the spitting out 
of the indigestible substance more feasible. Strongly irritating 
substances, acids, salts, etc., produce a copious flow of saliva 
which reduces their irritating action. As has been brought out

on page 382, conditioned reflexes can be aroused through the 
nose, the eyes, the ears, ete. This proves that definite reflex ares 
control the action of the glands. This can be shown even more 
clearly by cutting the cranial pre-ganglionie fibers (lingual 
nerve or the chorda tympani) and electrically stimulating the 
peripheral stump. A copious, thin, watery secretion results after 
an appreciable lateut period and at the same time there occurs 
an increased flow of blood through the gland. Excitation of the 
post-ganglionie fibers belonging to the sympathetic (thoracico-     
     
 
-P-A-G-E-207
  
ORGANS OF RESPONSE 193 
lumbar autonomic) also produces secretions of saliva. The amount 
is relatively small, is thick and turbid and contains many solids. 
At the same time the glands become pale, thus indicating that 
vascular constriction has occurred. It can be shown that secre- 
tion is not dependent upon the blood-pressure in the glands, 
since if the blood supply is cut off the glands will still secrete if 
its nerves are stimulated. In the above illustration, physiologists 
call the first set of fibers which produces the large supply of thin, 
watery secretion and the influx of blood secretory nerve fibers, 
whereas they call the other set which causes the formation of 
organic constituents of secretion trophic, since it influences the 
metabolism of the cells.* 
Glands of the Stomach.—The food after being moistened 
through the saliva is swallowed and is next acted upon by the 
glands in the stomach. The mucous membrane of the stomach 
as a whole contains secreting epithelial cells grouped into small 
glands distributed throughout the mucous membrane. If the 
membrane as a whole is examined, minute depressions, just 
visible to the naked eye, are seen, the so-called gastric pits. 
‘These are the openings of the glands. The glands at the pylori¢ 
part of the stomach (junction with small intestines) have a dif- 
ferent structure from those at the fundie end of the stomach, 
the details of which need not be entered into. The glands 
in the fundus have two kinds of secreting cells: the central 
or peptic cells, and the cells of the border, the parietal cells. The 
peptic cells are contained only in the glands of the pyloric part 
of the stomach. The peptic cells of the pyloric and fundic glands 
furnish apparently two digestive enzymes, pepsin and rennin; 
the parietal cells secrete hydrochloric acid. Until recently the 
nerve supply of the stomach glands was in doubt. It is now 
known that their action is controlled by reflex ares as in the case 
of the glands just considered. Special secretory nerves are pres- 
  
*The saliva as a digestive fluid acts mainly upon the starch. It con- 
tains an active enzyme, ptyalin. Ptyalin acts readily upon boiled starch, 
converting it into sugar and dextrin. In addition to its digestive function, 
the saliva moistens the food and makes it suitable for swallowing, and the 
mucin acts as a kind of lubricator. 
13  
-P-A-G-E-208
194. PSYCHOLOGY 
  ent. This is shown quite clearly in the phenomena which occur 
when a gastric fistula is made; at the same time the cwsophagus 
is divided halfway up to the neck, and subsequently made to open 
out upon the skin surface, When the animal is fed the food drops 
out again through the now external esophageal opening. The 
food thus never reaches the stomach. When an animal thus pre- 
pared is made to chew and swallow food (sham feeding) a marked 
secretion of gastric juice appears some five to six minutes later. 
This proves very definitely the existence of a reflex are system. 
It has been shown further that these glands show conditioned re- 
flexes (habit influence) similar to those exhibited in the case of 
the salivary glands. The secretory fibers to the stomach belong 
to the vagus (pre-ganglionic fibers). The experiments described 
above upon dogs have also been made upon human beings where 
a surgical operation for disease has made such an arrangement 
necessary. These conditioned reflexes play an important réle in 
the course of digestion. 
Pancreas.—After the food leaves the stomach it enters the 
small intestine. The upper ten inches of the small intestine is 
known as the duodenum. In the duodenum the contents of the 
alimentary tract are next subjected to the action of the secre- 
tions from the pancreas. The main duct of the pancreatic gland 
(duct of Wirsung) opens directly into the duodenum together 
with the common bile duct. The pancreas is a compound tubular 
gland like the salivary gland. The gland as a whole is long and 
irregular in shape. It is 12 or 13 em. long and weighs from 66 to 
102. grams. The gland is under definite neural control, the post- 
ganglionic fibers coming directly from the celiac plexus. The 
origin of the pre-ganglionic fibers is not so clear. Pavlow claims 
that the mechanical or electrical stimulation of the vagus or 
splanchnic gives a marked flow of pancreatic juice. As in the 
case of the other giands studied, conditioned reflexes may be 
operative in the pancreas, although the evidence is not so sure. 
Secretion seems to begin the moment food enters the stomach, 
which must be due to a neural impulse transmitted through the 
afferent nerves of the cerebro-spinal system and then out through 
the vagus to the celiac plexus (sympathetic) and thence over the
-P-A-G-E-209
    ORGANS OF RESPONSE 195 
post-ganglionic neurones to the gland. It is possible that the 
gland may be stirred to activity also by the action of a hormone, 
although this is contested. Starling states that the normal method 
of arousing the pancreatic secretion is not through reflex ares, 
but by chemical action; the acid of the gastric juice, upon reach- 
ing the duodenum, produces secretin. This in turn is absorbed 
by the blood, carried to the pancreas and stimulates this organ 
to activity (hormone action). It is said that the secretion brought 
about by nervous reflexes and by the action of the secretin are 
different. The former is thick, opalescent, rich in enzymes and 
protein, but poor in alkalides; the trypsin is secreted in active 
form. The secretion is stopped by atropin and started by pilocar- 
pin. The chemical secretion is thin and watery, contains few 
enzymes, and is rich in alkalides. The trypsin appears in inactive 
form. The secretion is not affected by atropin. The digestive 
action of the pancreatic secretion depends upon its three en- 
zymes, trypsin, diastase and lipase. Besides the glandular secre- 
tion pouring into the small intestine through the pancreatic 
duet, other secretions arise in this region from the small tubular 
glands which exist in the mucous membrane of the intestine itself. 
This region of the intestine is the place where the most active 
absorptions of the products of digestion (carbohydrates, fats, 
proteins) take place. 
The Liver.—At the same time that the contents of the ali- 
mentary tract are acted upon by the pancreas, they are also 
acted upon by secretions from the liver. As has been pointed out, 
the opening of the duct (bile) from the pancreas is common to 
the liver. This gland is really a gigantic structure, weighing 
close to 1600 grams. The liver is an organ receiving the very 
highest respect of the physiologists. It seems to be a laboratory 
for very complex chemical operations. The preparation of the 
bile, which is stored in a gall bladder and then injected into the 
duodenum, is probably only a secondary function. Post-gan- 
glionic neurones end in the liver and probably also afferent fibers 
belonging to the cerebro-spinal system. The formation of bile is 
not activated by the mere presence of foodstuffs in the gastro- 
intestinal tube, that is, the presence of food in the stomach does
-P-A-G-E-210
  196 PSYCHOLOGY 
not arouse a neural impulse which excites the liver cells to 
increased secretion. The alimentary substances must be absorbed 
into the blood ; they are passed by it through the portal vein and 
thus reach the liver, exciting it to secrete bile. A protein meal 
at the end of thirty minutes produces a marked increase in bile 
secretion, which reaches its maximum after four hours. A meal 
of fat similarly produces the secretion of bile. Carbohydrates 
produce only a slight secretion. Apparently the liver is also 
induced to secrete bile by an increased flow of blood. Interrup- 
tion of the blood stream arrests its secretion. 
From our standpoint the most interesting phenomenon con- 
nected with the liver is its power to convert the sugars into gly- 
cogen and to store it against a time of need. The function of 
glycogen and its formation is touched upon on page 219. 
The Kidney_ and Skin as Excretory Organs.—The main 
of katabolie processes. Its excretory activity, then, must stand 
in intimate relation with the composition of the blood. Two 
theories are held as regards the formation of urine which the 
kidneys secrete. It is held (1) that the urine is formed by the 
simple physical process of filtration and diffusion, since certain 
structures in the kidney (glomeruli) seem to be favorable organs 
for such a process. The theory holds that the water is filtered 
through them from the blood, carrying with it both the inorganic 
salts and the specific elements (urea, ete.) of the secretion. (2) 
The other view holds that the water and inorganic salts are pro- 
duced by filtration in the glomeruli, but that the urea and related 
bodies are eliminated through the activity of certain epithelial 
cells found in the convoluted tubes of the kidneys. Physiologists 
are somewhat divided in their adherence to these views, although 
the majority seem to side with the second. The kidneys receive 
a rich supply of nerve fibers, but their reflex function and connec- 
tions are not well understood. There is some evidence that the 
secretion of urine is controlled through chemical stimuli 
(hormones). 
The urine, which is very complex in its structure, is secreted 
continuously and carried to the bladder through the ureters, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
    + 
ORGANS OF RESPONSE 197 
is ejected from time to time from the bladder through the urethra 
by the act of micturition. 
The excretory glands of the skin are the sweat glands and seba- 
ceous glands; the former are particularly abundant in the palms 
of the hand and the soles of the feet (Fig. 6). There are probably 
two millions in the whole cutaneous surface. The secretory cells 
lie in the deep tissues of the skin. The duct is composed of 
smooth muscle cells. It opens upon the surface of the skin in 
pores. The average quantity of sweat eliminated in twenty-four 
hours may amount to two or three liters. The existence of secre- 
tory fibers running’ to the sweat glands has been definitely shown 
(post-ganglionic neurones). 
The sebaceous glands are found on cutaneous surfaces asso- 
ciated with the hair. They secrete an oily semi-liquid material. It 
is supposed that this secretion serves to protect the hairs from 
becoming too brittle and too easily permeated with moisture. 
The oiling of the skin which occurs by their action prevents 
an undue loss of heat from evaporation of the sweat. Similar 
glands are present in the sex organs. 
B, DUCTLESS GLANDS (INTERNAL SECRETION). 
Within recent years the ductless glands have become increas- 
ingly a subject of physiological experimentation. Many of the 
results which have been obtained throw light upon problems in 
behavior. The closest contact between this field and objective 
psychology is in the realm of emotional behavior. 
The study of emotions has always been backward in psychol- 
ogy, mainly because the psychologist could not get any way of 
envisaging them. Observation shows that the human organism 
does not always act in the same dead level way that he would 
presumably act if only the organized reflex pathways belong- 
ing to the central nervous system were functioning. Man goes 
about his daily duties with a varying amount of what, in a slangy 
way, has been called ‘‘pep,’’? and what has speculatively been 
called ‘‘drive’’ by scientific men. ‘‘Drive’’ is not a satisfactory 
word, because it seems to add something to the organism which 
comes in from the outside, whereas the term ‘‘pep’’ belongs pe- 
culiarly to the organism. The term ‘‘libido’’ has been used by 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  198 PSYCHOLOGY 
the Freudians in a somewhat similar way, but always with defi- 
nite sex implications. This term likewise for psychological use 
is not very satisfactory, however well it may work in psycho- 
pathology. The main facts which can be obtained by observation” 
seem to center around the following: (1) The human being seems 
at times to work at a higher level of energy than at other times 
(page 218) ; (2) at times the individual works with a persistency 
far beyond that ordinarily displayed; (3) the individual seems 
totally unable to accomplish his daily duties, execute his stable 
habits ; we speak of him as being excited, flighty, or else depressed. 
These are not meant as characterizations of the various emo- 
tional types or states. Attention is called to them merely to 
show that the organic tone changes from time to time, and that 
the individual displays an increase or decrease in emotional tone. 
It is thought that a study of the endocrine glands may help us 
to understand these factors. The following chapter takes up 
emotional response in detail. 
The Endocrine or Ductless Glands.—The endocrine glands 
differ from the duct glands which we have just considered in 
that they have no external outlet. The material which they 
manufacture is absorbed into.the blood stream and carried to 
other organs/ The active materials secreted by ductless glands 
have been termed hormones, which means etymologically ‘‘I stir 
up.’’ A good many of the hormones, though, inhibit action, so 
that certain authors prefer a different terminology. The term 
hormone as first used (by Starling) really meant any substance 
produced by cells in one part of the body and carried by the 
blood stream to more distant parts. According to this usage, 
there are a great many hormones not secreted by ductless glands, 
such as water, urea, glucose and inorganic salts. It seems better 
then to drop the term hormone and adopt the new term used by 
Schafer, autacoid substance, or simply autacoid. An autacoid 
is a specific organic substance formed by the cells of one organ 
and passed from it into the circulatory fluid to produce effect 
upon other organs similar to those produced by drugs (the in- 
ternal secretions of the endocrine glands apparently act like 
drugs). Further there are excitatory autacoids and those which  
-P-A-G-E-213
    ORGANS OF RESPONSE 199 
restrain or produce inhibition, inhibitory autacoids. The former 
wouwld come under the definition of a hormone, and the latter 
Schafer designates by a new word, chalone. The nature of auta- 
eoidal action is not well understood. We know that the active 
material is not injured by prolonged boiling. In general the 
autacoids have not been isolated. One, however, has been iso- 
lated and appears in crystalline form, adrenin. Two or three 
others may possibly have been isolated, for example, thyroxin. 
We know that they have an effect upon the sympathetic nerve 
centers, a direct effect upon smooth muscle and upon the secre- 
tion of other glands. 
ief Endocrine Glan 
glands into five principal divisions: (1) The thyroid apparatus, 
which consists of the two thyroids and the four small para- 
thyroids, two on each side. (2) The suprarenal apparatus; and 
(3) the pituitary apparatus. (4) The thymus and pineal 
glands. (5) The sex gland. There are several other glands 
which unquestionably secrete autocoid substances, as the pan- 
ereas and the alimentary mucous membrane. 
The Thyroid Glands.—Fig. 54 gives one view of the thyroid 
apparatus. It consists of the two lobes of the thyroid situated 
on either side of the larynx and windpipe, and of the connecting 
lobe (not shown), and of a superior and inferior parathyroid 
on each side. The superior parathyroid is in close contact with the 
thyroid and sometimes imbedded in it. The inferior parathyroid 
may lie in contact (ventral aspect) or be removed to a greater or 
less distance. Occasionally accessory thyroids, quite small in 
number, may occur. ( The thyroid is an organ made up of small 
closed vesicles; each vesicle is lined with epithelial cells. The , 
vesicles are generally filled with a viscid fluid ‘‘colloid.”’ There 
are very numerous blood-vessels, the thyroids being among the 
most vascular organs of the body.) The gland is innervated by 
the sympathetic (thoracico-lumbar) and by the vagus (pre-gan- 
glionic). The nerves are distributed both to the blood-vessels 
and directly to the secreting cells (epithelium). The colloid is 
insoluble in alcohol, water or ether. It doubtless contains the 
active principle and probably serves as a storehouse from which
-P-A-G-E-214
  200 PSYCHOLOGY 
the organism from time to time draws out a needed supply. The 
colloid of the human thyroid appears always to contain iodine. 
The parathyroids are very small, about 6 mm. in length, 3 
to 4mm. broad. Each parathyroid is a mass of epithelium-like 
cells. These are arranged in strands with numerous capillaries 
  Fie, 54.—1, @sophagus; 2, trachea; 3, inferior laryngeal nerve; 4, inferior thyroid artery; 5, inferior parathyroid; 6, thyroid (lateral lobe); 7, vagus nerve; 8, superior para- thyroid; i2, pharynx. (Morris's Human Anatomy.) P. Blakiston’s Son & Co. 
running between or around them. These glands contain some 
plain muscle fibers. Small vesicles are also present containing 
colloid material. The innervation is the same as the thyroid, the 
nerves ending both on the cells and on the blood-vessels. 
Effect of Removal of the Parathyroids.—If the four small 
parathyroids are removed, the animal usually dies within a few 
days or at most in a few weeks. For the first day or two, the only 
symptom is loss of appetite. The reflexes then become exalted, 
and later cramp-like contractions occur and eventually convul-
-P-A-G-E-215
ORGANS OF RESPONSE 201 
  sive fits. The body temperature may rise two or three degrees 
during the fit. The paroxysms are accompanied by rapid gasp- 
ing respiration, sometimes by vomiting and diarrhwa. The pic- 
ture as a whole is sometimes called tetany (tetania parathyreo- 
priva, not to be confused with normal tetanic contraction, page 
181). It is assumed that the parathyroids yield an autacoid of 
a restraining type which tends to prevent overexertion or dis- 
charge of nerve cells. Besides these apparent neural effects, 
there is a widespread effect on metabolism which can be noted 
in the few cases where the animal survives the operation for some 
length of time. In the young animal the calcification of the teeth 
is delayed, the skeletal bones remain smaller than in the controls. 
There is thus some reason for believing that the parathyroids 
furnish a second autacoid which is able to influence calcium 
metabolism. 
It has been found that the bad effects of removal of the para- 
thyroid can be partly relieved by the injection of the extract of 
parathyroid. Extract of pituitary is also said to keep the organ- 
ism alive. But so far a satisfactory way of keeping the animal 
alive for any considerable length of time has not been found. 
We shall see that the reverse is true when the thyroid is removed 
and the parathyroids are left intact. 
Removal of the Thyroid.—In removing the thyroid, at least 
two of the parathyroids must be left intact. The results of the 
removal of the thyroid, or of spontaneous atrophy of that organ, 
are most clearly marked in young animals. The following symp- 
toms appear: The growth, of the body as a whole, and especially 
of the skeleton, is arrested; the development of the generative 
organs is delayed; the integument is swollen, the skin remains 
dry and the hair thin; in the young human the face is pale and 
puffy and the abdomen is swollen; the fontanelles remain open; 
deaf-mutism is common; there is an arrest of the development of 
the cells in the cerebral cortex: This is the typical picture of 
cretinism. In the thyroid atrophy of the adult human (myx- 
wdema) a similar picture is presented. There is thickening and 
swelling of the integument, drying of the skin, falling out of the
-P-A-G-E-216
      202        PSYCHOLOGY 
hair, low body temperature and a general impairment of sensi- 
bility; the level of behavior is low; metabolism is diminished; 
there is a considerable deposition of fat with a diminution of sex 
function, and an increased tolerance for sugar. Myxcedema may 
be produced when goitrous tumors (the tumor destroying the 
secreting cells) are removed. This is called post-operative myx- 
edema (cachexia strumipriva). This may show itself in a few 
days or months or even years after the operation. Unless the 
parathyroids are removed with the thyroid, symptoms of tetany 
do not appear. 
It is interesting to note that the above symptoms, whether due 
to atrophy or to surgical removal of the gland, may be made to 
disappear or be allayed by the administration of thyroid sub- 
stance, either hypodermically or by the mouth. Persons can 
be completely restored to health and kept normal by eating the 
thyroid substance. If the treatment is omitted the symptoms 
again appear. The effects are therefore due to the absence of an 
autacoid that actively influences metabolism. 
Effect of Excess of Thyroid Secretion.—The effect of a too 
great amount of the thyroid autacoid can be tested by administer- 
ing thyroid extract by injection or by the mouth. The immediate 
results of intravenous injection are slight. When given by the 
mouth, there is a lowering of blood-pressure, rapid! pulse, with 
some irregularity, nervous excitability, flushing of the skin, in- 
creased perspiration and increase of nitrogen metabolism. If 
the feeding is long continued, the body fat is diminished and 
glycosuria may appear. In extreme cases there may be dilatation 
of the pupil, great excitement, sleepiness, and tremors of the 
limbs. In short, we have the symptoms which appear in exoph- 
thalmic goitre, where there is an enlarged gland (with no de- 
struction of tissue) with a great oversecretion of the thyroid 
autacoid. 
Exophthalmic goitre is more common in women than in men, 
a fact which may be related to the enlargement of the gland when 
the female reaches puberty and during pregnancy.

Chemical Isolation of the Thyroid Hormone.—Investigators 
for many years have been interested in the hormone or active 
principle produced by the thyroid gland. Many efforts have 
been made to isolate this hormone. As early as 1895 Baumann 
showed that the thyroid was rich in iodine. Until his work no 
one had thought that such an element as iodine existed in the 
body. This work was immediately fastened upon as showing 
that the active principle of the gland was iodine and that food 
containing iodine had to be supplied to the body. Investigators 
following Baumann, isolated various iodine compounds from 
the gland. These have been given various names and their dis- 
coverers have claimed that they are just as efficacious in myxe- 
dema as is the feeding of the whole gland. The matter was not 
settled until E. C. Kendall, working in the Mayo Foundation in 
Rochester, succeeded in isolating the active principle in the 
gland in its pure form. Nearly nine years of continuous re- 
search were spent in making this isolation. He calls it ‘‘ thy- 
roxin.’’ It contains no less than 60 per cent. of iodine. Thy- 
roxin is now extensively used in the treatment of thy- 
roid deficiency. Kendall claims never to have found a ease of 
thyroid deficiency that has not responded to an_ intra- 
venous injection of thyroxin. The response to thyroxin is 
apparently a quantitative one. One-third of 1 m.g. of this sub- 
stance increases the metabolic rate of a one-hundred-and-fifty 
pound individual 1 per cent. If the basal metabolic rate of 
an individual of this weight is 30 per cent. below normal (hypo- 
active thyroid) the administration of 10 m.g. will raise the rate 
to normal. By the administration of greater amounts of this 
substance the basal metabolic rate may be raised to a figure just 
as high as is compatible with life. As the metabolic rate is 
raised, the fundamental changes noted in the text occur, such as 
pulse rate increase, pulse pressure increase, utilization of body 
sugar. Fats and proteins will be used up in greater amounts 
than normal. The carbon dioxide output will be increased, as 
will the oxygen consumption, and there will be an increase 
in nitrogen elimination. Administration of ‘‘ thyroxin ’’ will 
relieve subnormal activity of tissues; i.e., myxcedema will dis- 
appear. If by the administration of ‘‘ thyroxin ’’ the metabolic 
rate is carried high enough, a condition like that found in hyper- 
thyroidism will result. 
The Adrenal Apparatus.—The secretions from the suprarenal  
-P-A-G-E-218
  
204. PSYCHOLOGY 
capsules or adrenals have a profound effect upon many of the tis- 
sues of the body. Attention was early directed to the adrenals 
because of their connection with Addison’s disease. 
The adrenals, which are closely attached to the kidneys, con- 
sist of two parts: (1) cortex, and (2) medulla which in man 
are anatomically joined, but which in some animals are completely 
separated (fish). 
The (1) cortex of the adrenal is composed of epithelium-like 
cells arranged in columns. There are a number of lipoid gran- 
ules, yellowish in color. The (2) adrenal medulla is composed 
of cells which have a different form and structure from those 
of the cortex. It is described as a solid cell mass permeated by 
capillaries and venous spaces somewhat similar to liver tissue. 
The cell protoplasm contains a number of granules and imparts 
a yellowish-brown color to the medulla when the adrenals are 
fixed in any solution containing chromic acid salts. Oftentimes 
there are a number of accessory glands which have a similar 
structure to the medulla (paraganglia or chromaffine). 
The suprarenals are richly supplied with nerves and blood- 
vessels. The blood supply to these glands is greater than that of 
any other organ in the body (except the pituitary body). The 
nerve supply is also rich. No less than thirty-three small bundles 
approach it (post-ganglionie neurones from the cceliae, phrenic 
and renal plexuses and from the splanchnic). The nerves enter 
the adrenal cortex supplying both the blood-vessels and its secret- 
ing cells, but the great majority pass into the adrenal medulla. 
Little is known regarding the functions of the cortex. It may 
partly prepare the material with which the medulla works. Some 
authors suggest that there is a close connection between the de- 
velopment of the sex organs and the adrenal cortex. 
Function of the Adrenal Medulla—tIn animals death fol- 
lows the removal of both glands. There is little disturbance 
noted at first, but at the end of a few days the animal becomes 
lively and begins to manifest signs of muscular weakness and 
incodrdination. The body temperature becomes lowered, weak- 
ness becomes extreme, pulse feeble and blood-pressure low. Since 
death always follows the removal of the adrenals, experimental 
surgery even in pathological cases is not resorted to in the human 
being. Addison’s disease, however, seems to be due to a degen- 
eration of the adrenal gland (usually tubercular). This disease
-P-A-G-E-219
ORGANS OF RESPONSE 205 
  is characterized by languor, general debility, weakness and loss 
of tone of the skeletal, vascular and visceral musculature. The 
heart action is feeble; there is a loss of appetite and a disturb- 
ance of the digestive tract with extreme emaciation. The bronz- 
ing of the skin is the most striking characteristic of Addison’s 
disease. The disease is nearly always fatal, but the life of a 
patient suffering from it may be prolonged for some years. 
So far it has been found to be impossible to secure beneficial 
results in Addison’s disease, or in the case of animals whose 
adrenals have been removed, by the administration of supra- 
renal extract. Nothing seems to take the place of the internal 
secretion of the gland. Nor has it been found possible to get 
an implanted adrenal to grow. 
Effect of Administering Suprarenal Extract.—The most 
striking effect is the marked rise in blood-pressure which is caused 
by the contraction of the peripheral arteries. The heart’s action 
is also slowed. ‘Adrenin seems to have a direct effect upon the 
sympathetic nerve endings in the unstriped muscular tissue, 
causing especially tonic contraction in the case of peripheral 
veins, and rhythmic contractions of the superior vena cava near 
the heart; Other unstriped muscular tissue, supplied by sym- 
pathetic fibers, is also affected: The spleen, the vagina, the uterus, 
vas deferens and the retractor penis are contracted, whereas 
there is inhibition in the intestines, the stomach, the cesophagus 
and the gall-bladder. A heavier flow of saliva results. The 
skeletal muscle has an increased excitability. The autacoid has 
been found to be able to defer the onset of fatigue in muscle and 
to assist in its recovery (page 243). It is thus seen that in this 
autacoid we have a direct influence upon the unstriped muscular 
tissue which is supplemental to, and possibly regulatory of, the 
nervous (autonomic sympathetic) control. The muscles which 
the sympathetic contracts, adrenin contracts; those it inhibits, 
adrenin inhibits. The autacoid from the posterior pituitary 
contracts (stimulates) the smooth muscles directly without re- 
gard to what action the sympathetic may have. 
Relation of the Adrenal Apparatus to the Other Glands.—. 
There is a close relationship between the sex glands and the 
adrenal. During pregnancy the whole gland undergoes enlarge-

ment, especially the cortical portion. The secretion of bile is 
increased by the adrenin. Furthermore, the autacoid of the 
medulla rapidly converts the liver glycogen into sugar which 
passes into the blood (page 241).4 Removal of the suprarenals 
affects the pancreas, producing a flow of pancreatic juice. If 
adrenin is injected this flow is stopped. 
  Tue Pirurrary APPARATUS. 
It is only within recent years that the pituitary body (hypo- 
physis cerebri) has been satisfactorily investigated4 It is a small 
organ, weighing less than half a gram. It lies at the base of 
the brain just posterior to the optic chiasma. It is connected with 
the floor of the third ventricle by a hollow stalk, the infundibu- 
lum. The whole structure is shown on the ventral surface of the 
brain (page 143). It is divided into an anterior portion and 
a posterior portion. The anterior part is richly supplied with 
blood-vessels. It is even more vascular than the adrenal. The 
two lobes have a different embryological history. The large 
anterior lobe is formed by invagination of the buccal ectoderm. 
It is a truly glandular structure. A part of the posterior lobe 
has the same origin (pars intermedia). The other part of the 
posterior lobe (pars nervosa) is really an outgrowth from the 
floor of the third ventricle of the brain. 
Function of the Pituitary Body.—When extracts from the 
posterior lobe are injected into the circulation, the heart rate is 
slowed and the blood-pressure raised, but the effects are less   
*It is thought that glycogen forms a temporary reserve supply of carbo- 
hydrate material which the body requires in large amounts. It is sup- 
posed that during digestion the carbohydrate food is absorbed into the 
blood (porta! system) as dextrose and galactose. If these passed directly 
through the liver unchanged, there would be an excess of sugar secreted, by 
the kidneys, but it is assumed that as this blood rich in sugars passes 
through the liver, the excess of sugar is extracted by the liver cells. It is 
dehydrated and exists there in the form of glycogen. Under the action of 
the nerves or of adrenin, the glycogen is reconverted into dextrose and is 
then carried by the blood to whatever point it may be needed. This conver- 
sion of the stored glycogen into sugar is known as glycogenolysis. We have 
therefore in the liver a large supply of food which can be easily converted 
and quickly utilized. The way it may be utilized in emotional stress 
where great muscular activity is called for will be described later.
-P-A-G-E-221
  
ORGANS OF RESPONSE 207 
marked than in the case of adrenin. These extracts seem to exer- 
cise a stimulating effect upon the involuntary muscles of the 
body ; the intestine, bladder and uterus are all made to contract 
directly. It was pointed out on page 205 that adrenin may give 
either contraction or relaxation, depending upon the action the 
sympathetic autonomic has upon these fibers. The posterior lobe 
extract produces contraction in all cases. This excites other 
glands, the kidneys, mammary glands, and apparently acceler- 
ates the process of sugar conversion in the liver. 
The anterior lobe extract produces no noticeable effect when 
first administered. 
Removal of the whole pituitary body produces death in a few 
days. There is a fall in temperature, an unsteady gait, rapid 
emaciation and diarrhea. Apparently this will happen when 
the anterior lobe alone is removed. Removal of the posterior 
lobe alone is not necessarily fatal. The animal shows greater 
tolerance for sugar; fat is increased. When’ the operation is 
made on young animals, there is an arrested development of the 
sex glands. Clinical observation shows that when the gland 
is overactive the chief effect noticeable is gigantism. The 
growth of the skeleton is much greater. If the condition 
occurs in adults, there is a very great enlargement of the bones 
of the face and extremities (acromegaly). When there is a 
diminished secretion due to pathological conditions there is obes- 
ity and sexual infantilism. Gigantism is supposed to be due to an 
overactive anterior lobe; obesity and sexual infantilism to the 
lack of secretion of the posterior lobe. The anterior lobe would 
thus seem to furnish an autacoid which stimulates skeletal 
growth and the connective tissues, and in addition exercises a 
wide influence upon metabolism in general. The posterior lobe 
furnishes one or several autacoids which stimulate the plain 
muscle; excite the secretory activity of other glands; hasten the 
conversion of glycogen into sugar, and produce a regulatory 
action of the reproductive organs. 
The Pineal and Thymus Glands.— The pineal gland is one of 
the brain structures. It is found on the posterior aspect of the 
brain stem just anterior to the corpora quadrigemina (Fig. 32, 
14). It is a glandular structure in man possibly functional
-P-A-G-E-222
  
  208 PSYCHOLOGY 
throughout life. It seems to exert its main function however 
early in the life of the individual. In children, if the functions 
of this gland are disturbed, there is a rapid development of the 
reproductive organs, precocity and an increased growth of skele- 
ton. It is thus supposed that the gland furnishes an inhibitory 
autacoid. The thymus, situated in the neck near the thyroid 
is another gland which apparently is of chief importance in child- 
hood. Although it, like the pineal, may possibly function through- 
out life, it increases in weight and size up to the end of puberty 
and then gradually gets smaller. The function of the thymus 
is in dispute. Dr. Walter Timme links the pineal and the thymus 
into a related system which dominates the life cycle from birth 
to puberty.’ 
The-Sex Gland as an Endocrine Organ.—The organs of re- 
production—the sexual glands—furnish both an external secre- 
tion contributing to the reproduction of the species, and an 
internal secretion) The cells producing the two secretions are to 
be found together but they are entirely distinct in their func- 
tions. The external secretion is produced by the true sex cells 
or gonads. The internal secretion is produced by the so-called 
interstitial cells (sometimes called ‘‘ puberty gland ’’). 
The hormone from the interstitial cells exerts a marked in- 
fluence upon bodily development. This is shown by the growth 
changes that take place when the sex glands are completely ex- 
cised in the male before puberty) The youth grows to be quite 
tall; the larynx fails to develop ; hence the childish soprano voice 
never changes} the skin is poorly pigmented; layers of fat accu- 
mulate; the breasts increase in size. Such individuals are beard- 
less. They apparently approach the ‘‘ neutral ’’ in type. These 
changes are due apparently solely to the lack of the hormone 
coming from the puberty gland. 
On the behavior side there is in the eunuch a lack of sex   
* Before taking up the study of the sex glands, it is well to point out 
that it is now well established that the pancreas furnishes an internal 
secretion which inhibits glycogenolysis. This may, through conditioning, 
play an important réle in emotional reactions (account for exhaustion 
after certain emotional responses).
-P-A-G-E-223

aggressiveness and of all other forms of positive sex behavior, 
Our information, however, upon the general behavior changes 
necessarily resulting from castration is almost nil. Such indi- 
viduals have always been set aside by society for certain inferior 
duties—keepers of the harem, male sopranos and the like. They 
are told by word of mouth and by what they read that there is 
something lacking in their make-up—that they are inferior. 
Of course, the lack of habits based upon sex activity even in the 
absence of social stigmatization marks them off from the general 
run of men. 
So far these individuals have apparently escaped the hands 
of the mental testers. Hence we know little about their I.Q. The 
fact that many eunuchs have attained distinction along intel- 
lectual lines would seem to indicate that progress in ordinary 
academic subjects may take place at the normal rate. 
The results of castration upon the female are not so well 
known. There are few cases where the ovaries have been removed 
before. puberty. Animal experiments seem to establish the fact 
that the hormone from the ovaries exerts a tendency upon the 
part of the female to revert to the male type. For example: if 
the ovaries are removed from the duck and the pheasant, male 
plumage is assumed. 
In the adult (both male and female) the hormone from the 
puberty gland seems to be mainly responsible both for sexual 
vigor and sex aggressiveness, and for the youthfulness and activi- 
tation of all the other glandular systems of the body. At any 
rate, there is a growing tendency on the part of investigators 
(possibly in the absence of critical proof) to believe that man 
isasold as his glands. And since the remaining glands apparently 
cannot stay youthful in the absence of a sufficient output from the 
puberty glands, it is only natural to connect senescence or old age 
with a decline in the output from this gland. 
Methods of Increasing the Hormone Supply from the 
Puberty Gland.—For years the dream of man has been to find 
eternal youth. Brown-Sequard (1889) thought he had found 
14
-P-A-G-E-224
    210 PSYCHOLOGY 
it through the effects to be had from the injection of extracts 
obtained from the gonadal system of the ram. These extracts 
he claimed restored his youth and vigor. Other investigators 
could not confirm his finding and this great physiologists fell 
into disrepute. 
During the past three years new light has been thrown upon 
this problem. Steinach has shown that it is possible, even after 
the onset of old age, to increase the output of the pubérty gland. 
Lygation of the ductus deferens combined with vasectomy cause 
the sperm cells (reproductive) that produce the external secre- 
tion, to atrophy and finally to disappear. The interstitial cells 
(puberty gland), however, not only do not atrophy subsequent 
to the operation but may actually increase in number and in size. 
An increased output of the sex hormone takes place which reac- 
tivates the entire endocrine system of the patient, causing clinical 
results, varying from nothing more than an ‘‘ endocrine tonic ”’ 
to an almost actual ‘‘ rejuvenation.”’ 
The effects of the operation may not fully appear under six 
months. The length of time improvement may continue has not 
yet been determined due to the recency of all such operations. 
This operation is performed when there are indications of a 
lack of active functioning of the gonadal system—as is the case 
both in senility and in premature senility. It should be noted 
that while individuals undergoing this operation lack the external 
sperm secretion, the sex reflexes are otherwise quite normal 
(tumescence, orgasm, ete.). 
The Method of Testicular Grafting—An entirely different 
method of supplying the body with the gonadal hormone has been 
devised by Dr. Serge Voronoff of Paris. He transplants in the 
senescent animal the whole or a part of the testicle from a young 
and vigorous animal of the same species. This testicular graft 
ean be transplanted under the skin or in the peritoneum—theo- 
retically into any part of the body. 
With suitable technique the graft ‘‘ takes.’’ Quite often, 
however, the graft is expelled or is reabsorbed. When the graft 
lives and begins to function, the interstitial cells (puberty gland)
-P-A-G-E-225
ORGANS OF RESPONSE 211 
  begin to supply the blood stream with their characteristic hor- 
mone. (It should be noted that in such grafts the sperms cells 
soon disappear.) 
The following experiment of Voronoff on an animal, quoted 
from Harrow (Glands in Health and Disease, p. 109) is most 
enlightening : 
“Tn another experiment a ram 12 to 14 years old—corresponding 
to about 80 years in man—which could hardly totter, had implanted the 
fragments of a testicle obtained from a young man. Two months after 
the graft had been effected the animal was completely transformed. 
His urinal incontinence had disappeared; so had tremblings of the 
legs; and he no longer looked afraid. His bodily carriage had become 
magnificent, he behaved in a lively and aggressive manner. The old 
ram had taken on the appearance of remarkable youth and vigor. He 
was isolated in a small stable, together with a young ewe-lamb, which 
afforded the opportunity for observing not only the awakening of his 
sexual instincts, which he had lost years ago, but also the following 
more tangible result: the ewe-lamb covered by him in September, 1918, 
dropped a vigorous lamb in February, 1919. There is nothing in the 
fact to cause surprise. Old animals, like very aged men, occasionally 
still possess spermatozoids which are altogether alive, but it is the 
atrophy of the internai secretive glands which prevents their experienc- 
ing the sexual appetite and manifesting their virility.” 
“ Doctor Voronoff’s next procedure with the rejuvenated animal was 
excellent from the scientific standpoint. He removed the graft. Three 
months later the animal had completely aged. Then he reimplanted an- 
other graft from the testical of a younger animal. Once again the animal 
showed signs of rejuvenation. Nothing in the whole book approaches 
in value this particular experiment.” 
Similar experiments upon man have been tried by Voronoft 
and others. Apparently in some cases the graft takes with bene- 
ficial results. A search of the literature, however, fails to reveal 
very many cases where the results of such operations have been 
critically tested. 
Even granting the successful nature of the operation, suitable 
human material for grafting will always be hard to obtain. 
This has led to experiments on the transplantation of testic- 
ular grafts obtained from the higher apes. Investigators are 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
    212 PSYCHOLOGY 
still skeptical of the success of this work. Thorek (Endocrinology, 
November, 1922, p. 771) claims to have devised a surgical method 
which gives perfectly satisfactory results in transplanting the 
testes of higher apes to man. 
There seems to be some doubt about the possibility of lengthen- 
ing life by such experiments but there is reason to believe that 
ultimately man will be able to lengthen the span of sex activity. 
Some of the Important Social Consequences of Rejuvenation: 
1. It will decrease the amount of invalidism. Invalid- 
ism is often resorted to after sex competition has been given 
up as hopeless or through actual failure of sex functioning. 
Competition in sex, business and in science will be prolonged. 
The 50-70 year age-span will be useful and happy. 
2. The tremendous pressure to accumulate wealth between 
the years of 20-60 may be somewhat relieved. Old men retain- 
ing their energies will hold their positions for a much longer 
period of time. They should be far more valuable to society 
than younger men because of their richer experience. 
3. If this psychological pressure of the fear of impotence at 
fifty is relieved, such experiments may bring a more leisurely 
journey through the 20-30 year period giving time for culture 
and for laying more enduring foundations for scientific, business 
and artistic careers. H 
4, The most interesting phase of the prolongation of youth 
will take place in the domain of marriage. Economie pressure 
now postpones marriage and enables the older man to compete 
with younger men. Only the fear of possible impotence with 
the onset of age keeps this competition in check. The older man 
has considerable in his favor—experience, social position, wealth, 
poise. Even in the absence of rejuvenation, older men to-day 
are younger than they were a few decades ago. With the spread 
of knowledge about rejuvenation the marriageable age limit for 
men will be still further advanced.

  5. Coincident with these important changes in sex habits will 
come new legislation, and considerable changes in the present 
laws concerning the sex control of individuals. 
Concluding Statements on the Glands and Muscles.—In the 
present chapter, as in the preceding one, we have been dealing with 
parts of the organism and their functioning. It remains to call 
attention to the fact that, only rarely do the various parts fune- 
tion in an isolated way. Any stimulation strong enough to reach 
the motor side of the central nervous system. brings about not 
only narrow reflex and associated activities (segmental reactions) 
but widespread changes in the organism as a whole. Even so 
simple an activity as putting on our clothes and lacing up our 
shoes in the morning involves a most complex series of adjust- 
ments of a motor and glandular kind such as the proper relations 
of action between extension and flexion, changes in autonomic 
activity such as are seen in the regulation of the pupil and in 
respiration and circulation. Our study of the glands has taught 
us that muscular activity cannot go on for any length of time 
without involving changes in those organs; sweat begins to form, 
sugar is released to serve as food for the muscles, adrenin is con- 
tributed to the blood stream, which not only neutralizes fatigue 
“products but also acts upon the autonomie system in such a way 
as to increase the flow of blood to the muscular organs in opera- 
tion. The thyroid glands secrete and affect not only other glands, 
either increasing their output or checking it, but also possibly 
all of the cells of the body as well. The eating of the simplest 
meal starts another widespread series of changes in the body 
as a whole, beginning the moment food enters the mouth and 
continuing until the products of digestion are absorbed and 
stored for future use and the waste products eliminated. 
The material we have gathered in the last three chapters 
should emphasize the difference between physiology and psy- 
chology. The science of physiology deals with part reactions 
whereas psychology deals with the adjustments of the organism 
as a whole. We have entered into these psysiological studies in 
order to get a better grasp upon what is meant by whole organ- 
ism. Our remaining studies will deal with activities which re- 
quire the codperation of the body as a whole.

CHAPTER VI 
UNLEARNED BEHAVIOR: ‘‘ EMOTIONS ”’ 
Introduction.—In the last three chapters we have been con- 
cerned with the details of sensory-motor adjustment. We turn 
next to man as a reacting organism, and specifically to some of 
the reactions which belong to his hereditary equipment. Human 
action as a whole can be divided into hereditary modes of re- 
sponse (emotional and instinctive), and acquired modes of re- 
sponse (habit). Each of these two broad divisions is capable of 
many subdivisions. It is obvious both from the standpoint of 
common-sense and of laboratory experimentation that the hered- 
itary and acquired forms of activity begin to overlap early 
in life. Emotional reactions become wholly separated from the 
stimuli that originally called them out (transfer, page 234), 
and the instinctive positive reaction tendencies displayed by the 
child soon become overlaid with the organized-habits of the adult. 
This process of masking or dovetailing of activities is a part of 
the general process of organization. The separation between* 
hereditary reaction modes and acquired reaction modes can thus 
never be made absolute. Fortunately in most connections psy- 
chology is not called upon to draw a sharp distinction between 
hereditary and acquired reactions. In making laboratory studies, 
however, it is sometimes necessary for us to study the details of 
hereditary response. We find it simpler in such cases to over- 
emphasize for the time the definiteness of the separation. This 
is unquestionably a legitimate mode of procedure in science. 
Few biological problems permit of any other treatment. In order 
to accomplish this at all we have to adopt a genetic method. We 
have to start with the baby’s advent (we would start before if it 
were not for possible injury to mother and child) and follow his 
development step by step, noting the first appearance of the 
hereditary forms of reaction, their course and effect upon the 
moulding of the child’s whole personality; and the early be- 
ginnings of acquired modes of response. Undoubtedly learning 
214 
   
-P-A-G-E-229
  
   HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: EMOTIONS 215 
begins in utero (there is no reason to suppose that conditioned 
reflexes do not begin there), and probably several hereditary 
modes of action (particular types of reflexes) run their entire 
course in utero. But we are entering here upon a field which 
just at present is purely speculative. . 
What Is an Emotion?—Hard and fast definitions are not 
possible in the psychology of emotion, but formulations are pos- 
sible and sometimes-help us to group our facts. A formulation 
which will fit a part of the emotional group of reactions may be 
stated as follows: An emotion is an hereditary ‘‘pattern-reac- 
tion’’ involving profound changes of the bodily mechanism as 
a whole, but particularly of the visceral and glandular systems. 
By pattern-reaction we mean that the separate details of response 
appear with some constancy, with some regularity and in approx- 
imately the same sequential order each time the exciting stimulus 
is presented. (It is obvious that if this formulation is to fit the 
facts, the general condition of the organism must be such that 
the stimulus can produce its effect. A child alone in a house on 
a stormy night with only a dim candle burning may display the 
reaction of fear at the mournful hoot of an owl. If the parents 
are at hand and the room is well lighted, the stimulus may pass 
unreacted to. Stimulus then in this sense is used in a broad 
way to refer not only to the exciting object but also to the gen- 
eral setting (page 10). There is implied also the fact that the 
general state of the organism must be sensitive (capable of being 
stimulated) to this form of stimulus at the moment. This con- 
dition is very important. A young man may be extremely sen- 
sitive to the blandishments of every female he meets while in 
the unmarried state and may show considerable excitement and 
+ Throughout the chapter we have introduced physiological concepts into 
the behavior study of emotions. It is possible that we have given the impres- 
sion that we are writing a physiology of the emotions. Such is not the case. 
It is perfectly possible for a student of behavior entirely ignorant of the 
sympathetic nervous system and of the glands and smooth muscles, or even 
of the central nervous system as a whole, to write a thoroughly compre- 
hensive and accurate study of the emotions—the types, their interrelations 
with habits, their réle, ete. We have tried to connect emotiorial activity 
with physiological processes because it seems that such formulations are now 
practical and no longer purely speculative.   
 
-P-A-G-E-230
216 PSYCHOLOGY 
  over-reaction on such occasions. In most cases, he becomes con- 
siderably less sensitive after being happily married. ‘This for- 
mulation may seem somewhat roundabout—somewhat like saying 
that a stimulus is an emotional stimulus only when you get the 
pattern-reaction, but this is very nearly the case. Possibly we 
can illustrate most easily what we mean by choosing an example 
from animal life. When the naturalist comes suddenly upon a 
young sooty tern under four days of age, it lies stock still (it is 
capable of very rapid locomotion): It can be pushed about or 
rolled over without, explicit forms of response appearing. The 
moment the intruder moves away, the fledgling may hop to its 
feet and dash away or give one of its instinctive cries. The pat- 
tern-reaction, that is, the explicit observable pattern, is very 
simple indeed—a death feint or posture. Such a type of response 
is quite common in the animal world. In order to bring about 
such a tremendous variation in behavior in an animal usually so 
active there must be a profound modification of the organie pro- 
cesses. We shall see later that the locus of the effect (the im- 
plicit side, page 198) is principally in the visceral system. Often, 
however, the skeletal musculature is involved in the pattern. 
A serviceable way to mark off an emotional reaction from an 
instinctive reaction is to include in the formulation of emotion a 
factor which may be stated as follows: The shock of an emotional 
stimulus throws the organism for the moment at least into a 
chaotic state.2 When in the first shock of an emotional state, the 
subject makes few adjustments to objects in his environment. 
Tn contrast to this stand the instincts as we shall see farther on. 
The subject in an instinctive act usually does something: he 
  
*Tt is most interesting that with many psychologists and with a good 
many physiologists and neurologists the newer conceptions of experimental 
zodlogy make slow progress. Experimental biologists and students of 
animal behavior have begun to put the emphasis upon accurate statements 
of what really happens in hereditary adjustments rather than to seek 
in them the exposition of the dogma that they exist because they are useful 
or serviceable. No one who has watched animals display their hereditary 
forms of activity from birth to the adult stage could hold that more than 
a few, considering the thousands which exist, fit such a philosophic and 
really vitalistic mould. The case of the human infant is not different. 
   
-P-A-G-E-231
HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: EMOTIONS 217 
throws his hand up for defense, blinks his eyes or ducks his head; 
runs away; he bites, scratches, kicks and grasps whatever his 
hand touches. W» may express our formulation in convenient 
terms somewhat as fellows: when the adjustments called out by 
the stimulus are internal and confined to the subject’s body, we 
have emotion, for example, blushing; when the stimulus leads to 
adjustment of the organism as.a whole to objects, we have instinct, 
for example, defense responses, grasping, ete. Emotions seldom 
~ appear alone... The stimulus usually calls out émotional instine=” 
tive and habit factors simultaneously. 
Additional Formulations.—The above formulation fits only 
the more stereotyped forms of emotional response as seen, for 
example, in the states popularly called blushing, anger, fear 
and shame. When we take into account the whole group of phe- 
nomena in which we see emotional manifestations in adults, a 
pronounced modification is necessary. Apparently the heredi- 
tary pattern as a whole, gets broken up. At any rate it largely 
disappears (the parts never wholly disappear) except under un- 
usual conditions, and there can be noted only a reinforcement or 
inhibition of the habit and instinctive (exaggerated and de- 
pressed reflexes, for example) activities taking place at the 
moment. We mean to imply here only the generally observed 
facts typified by such popular expressions as ‘‘He is working at 
a low ebb to-day,’’ ‘‘His tone is low,’’ ‘‘He’s a gloom’’; in 
psychopathology when this phase is more marked, depressions are 
spoken of. The opposite picture is popularly portrayed by such 
expressions as ‘‘Jones is full of pep to-day,’’ ‘‘he is excited,’’ 
“happy,’’ “he is working with a.punch ’’; in psychopathology, 
the exaggerated type of this behavior is termed manic. It will be 
noted that these expressions refer to the activity level at which 
all of an individual’s acts are accomplished, that is, they do not 
refer to the pattern type of emotion. Only in pathological cases, , 
or in the case of normals in periods of a cataclysmic nature, such/ 
as war, earthquake, and the sudden death of loved ones, do we? 
get a complete return to the original and more infantile type } 
of emotional response. 
Observation would seem to suggest the following formula- 
   
-P-A-G-E-232
218 PSYCHOLOGY 
  tion: Organized activity (hereditary and acquired) may go on 
and usually does go on at a given level. We may call the most 
usual the normal level, or level, of equilibrizm. It varies with 
different individuals and one can determine it even with respect 
to a single individual only after observing him for a considerable 
time. We may note further that an individual at one time may 
exhibit more energy, push or pep than normal, for example, dur- 
ing and immediately after a cold shower; we may call this the 
excited level. Again at times he works at a level lower than nor- 
mal, for example, when in trouble, after money losses or illness; 
we may call this the depressed level. 
Without neurologizing too much, we may venture the assump- 
tion that in adults environmental factors have brought about 
the partial inhibition of the more external features of the prim- 
itive pattern types of emotion. The implicit, mainly glandular 
and smooth muscular side of the pattern, remains. The emo- 
tionally exciting object releases important internal secretions 
which, without initiating new (part) reactions, reinforce or in- 
hibit those actually in progress. This hypothesis would account 
for changes in level. Only in rare cases do we see mere changes 
in level. Usually when such changes occur, certain auxiliary or 
additional part reactions appear, such as we see in whistling 
while at work, keeping time with the feet, drumming on the table, 
biting the finger nails. These types of reaction are singled out 
and spoken of in some detail under the head Emotional Outlets 
(page 236). 
The Genetic Study of Emotion in the Child.—Unfortunately 
for the subject of psychology, few experiments have been made 
upon the emotional life of the child under anything like as 
favorable conditions as obtain in the study of animals. Our obser- 
vations upon the child are similar to those which were made upon 
animals before Thorndike and Lloyd Morgan introduced the ex- 
perimental method. Until very recently, in spite of volumes 
written upon it, discussion has been of the armchair variety. The 
superstition that the human infant is too fragile for study is giv- 
ing way to a more sensible viewpoint. It has proven practicable 
in some laboratories to take infants from birth and to study them 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: EMOTIONS 219 
from the same point of view that animals are studied, giving due 
consideration to those factors in behavior which do not appear 
in animal response. But unfortunately this work is handicapped 
because there are no facilities in maternity wards for keeping 
the mother and ¢hild under close observation for years, a condi- 
tion which is indispensable for real systematic work. 
Summary of Positive Results; Early Types of Emotional 
Reactions.—A fter observing a number of infants, especially dur- 
ing the first months of life, we suggest the following group of 
emotional reactions .as belonging to the original and fundamental 
nature of man <fesrrtuge and love (using love in approximately 
the same sense that Freud uses sex). We use these terms which 
are current in psychology with a good deal of hesitation. The 
student is asked to find nothing in them which is not fully statable 
in terms of situation and response. Indeed, we should be willing 
to call them emotional reaction states X, Y and Z. They are far 
more easily observable in animals than in infants. 
Fear.—What stimulus apart from,all training will call out 
fear responses; what are these responses, and how early may 
they be called out? The principal situations which call out fear 
responses seem to be as follows: (1) To suddenly remove from 
the infant all means of support, as when one drops it from the 
hands to be caught by an assistant (in the experiment the child 
is held over a bed upon which has been placed a soft feather 
pillow) ; (2) by loud sounds; (3) occasionally when an infant 
is just falling asleep or is just ready to waken, a sudden push 
or a slight shake is an adequate stimulus; (4) when an infant is 
just falling asleep, occasionally'the sudden pulling of the blanket 
upon which it is lying will produce the fear responses. (3) and   
* This list is identical with James’ list of coarser emotions except for 
the omission of grief, which James puts first. Grief we look upon as being 
a reactive state (connected with love, really) ‘in which the object or situa- 
tion which usually calls out-in the subject the reactions of love is suddenly 
removed. The state of grief must be looked upon as a mal-adjustment 
period, where the objects and situations which have usually called out both 
the original love responses and the conditioned reflexes built upon them are 
lacking. The state (in normal cases) disappears as soon as new objects 
are found or new conditioned reflexes have been entrained. 
   
-P-A-G-E-234
    220 PSYCHOLOGY 
(4) above may be looked upon as belonging under (1). The re- 
sponses are a sudden catching of the breath, clutching randomly 
with the hands (the grasping reflex invariably appearing when 
the child is dropped), sudden closing of the eye-lids, puckering 
of the lips, then erying; in older children possibly flight and 
hiding (not yet ‘observed by us as ‘‘original’’ reactions). * In 
regard to the age at which fear responses first appear, we can 
__ state with some sureness that the above mentioned group of reac- 
tions appears at birth. It is often stated that children are 
“tustinctively afraid inthe dark. While we shall advance our 
opinion with the greatest caution, we have not so far been able to 
gather any evidence to this effect (page 226). When such reac- 
tions to darkness do appear they are due to other causes ; darkness 
comes to be associated with absence of customary stimulation, 
noises, etc. (they should be looked upon as conditioned fear 
reactions). From time immemorial children have been ‘‘scared’’ 
in the dark, either unintentionally or as a means of controlling 
them (this is especially true of children reared in the South). 
Rage.—In a similar way the question arises as to what is the 
original situation which brings out the activities seen in rage. 
Observation seems to show that the hampering of the infant’s 
movements is the factor which apart from all training brings 
out the movements characterized as rage. If the face or head 
is held, erying results, quickly followed by screaming. The body 
stiffens and fairly well-codrdinated slashing or striking move- 
ments of the hands and arms respilt; the feet and legs are drawn 
up and down; the breath! is held until the child’s face is flushed. 
In older children the slashing movements f the arms and legs 
are better codrdinated, and appear as kicking, slapping, push- 
ing, ete. These reactions continue until the irritating situation 
is relieved, and sometimes do not cease then. Almost any child 
from birth can be thrown into a rage if its arms are held tightly 
to its sides; sometimes even if the elbow joint is clasped tightly 
between the fingers the response appears; at times just the plac- 
ing of the head between cotton pads will produce it. This was 
noticed repeatedly when testing eye coérdinations in infants 
under ten days of age. The slight, constraint put upon the head 
 
-P-A-G-E-235
HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: EMOTIONS 221 
by the soft pads would often result in a disturbance so great 
that the experiment had to be discontinued for a time. 
Love.—The original situation which calls out the observable 
love responses seems to be the stroking or manipulation of some 
erogenous zone, tickling, shaking, gentle rocking, patting and 
turning upon the stomach across the attendant’s knee. The re- 
sponse varies. If the infant is crying, crying ceases, a smile may 
appear, attempts at gurgling, cooing, and finally, in slightly 
older children, the extension of the arms, which we should class 
as the forerunner of the embrace of adults. The smile and the 
laugh which Freud connects with the release of repression (we 
are not denying in the case of adults this may be true) we should 
thus class as original reaction tendencies intimately connected 
from infancy with the stimulation of, in our opinion at least, 
the erogenous zones. 
These types fit fairly well the general formulation we gave on 
page 215. There is a reaction pattern; there is a definite stimu- 
lus, which has its peculiarly exciting character (the reason for 
which must be sought in biology) ; the radius of action is small; 
no particular adjustment is made to any object: in the environ- 
ment. It is admitted, however, that the responses contain both 
explicit and implicit components, that is, involve the skeletal 
musculature, the visceral system, the smooth muscles and glands. 
It is probable, though, that if the exciting stimulus were suffi- 
ciently strong—strong enough to produce ‘‘shock’’—or if con- 
tinued for a sufficient length of time, the subject would tend to 
take on more and more the purely vegetative type of existence 
illustrated by the example of the young tern. din rage, the child 
becomes so stiff, and holds its breath for such a long time, that it 
is often necessary to soothe it. The final stage in any great emo- 
tion would seem to be paralysis or the ‘‘death feint. oy Approxi- 
mations to this condition are seen in the paralysis of fear, in the 
fainting under strong emotional excitement, in the stereotyped 
reactions of the stoics and martyrs when they unflinchingly en- 
duréd the torch. Individuals on the battlefield, likewise, are able 
‘ withstand operations, wounds, and injuries without complaint. 
j that there is a constant tendency for the

organized habit response of the individual to disappear under 
the extremes of emotion. So far as we can see, this tendency 
towards stereotypy, paralysis or the death feint under the im- 
mediate effect of a strong emotional excitement has no biological 
or adaptive value (see page 243), however, on post-emotional 
state). The organism exhibiting it is at the mercy of its enemies, 
whether on the battlefield or in the struggle 
age tribes, and is at a disadvantage in the ra 
after woman, or in the fight for business and for food among sav- 
e for a much-sought- 
scientific reputation. 
Negative Results of Experimental Study.—Three babies 
from the Harriet Lane Hospital were put into various situations, 
the types of which are illustrated below, for the purpose of find- 
ing out whether there is a wider range of stimuli that may arouse 
an emotional reaction than the one we cited a moment ago. 
These babies represented splendid, healthy types. Their mothers 
were the wet nurses belonging to the hospital. They were 165, 
126 and 124 days of age. The first two, whose ages are given, 
were put through the more numerous tests. The experiments 
are interesting for the reason that the bal

lowed to flap its wings near the baby’s face. She watched it 
intently, showing no tendency to avoid it, but did not reach for 
it. When the bird became quiet she reached for it, and caught 
hold of its beak with her left hand. 
Test with a rabbit. The animal was put on a couch in front 
of her. (The child was sitting on her mother’s lap.) She watched. 
it very intently but did not reach for it until the experimenter 
held it in his hands close to her; then she reached for it imme- 
diately, catching one of its ears in her left hand, and attempted 
to put it into her mouth. 
The last animal presented to her was a white rat. She paid 
little attention to it, only fixating it occasionally. She followed 
it with her eyes somewhat when it moved about the couch. When 
held out to her on the experimenter’s arm, she turned her head 
away, no longer stimulated. 
April 24, 172 days old. The baby was taken into a dark room 
with only an electric light behind her, not very bright (faint 
illumination). <A stranger held the baby. The mother sat where 
she could not be seen. A dog was brought into the room and 
allowed to jump up on the couch beside her. The baby watched 
intently every move the dog made but did not attempt to reach 
for it. Then she turned her head aside. The front light was then 
turned up and the dog again exhibited. The infant watched 
very closely every move the dog and the experimenter made, but 
did not attempt to catch the dog. Exhibited no fear reactions, no 
matter how close the dog was made to come to her. 
The black cat was then “brought in (both lights on). The 
cat rubbed against the baby’s feet and put her front paws in the 
baby’s lap, touching its nose to her hand. The baby watched 
intently and reached for it with her left hand. The front light 
was then turned out. The experimenter held the cat closer to 
her, and she reached for it with both hands. 
Rabbit. She reached for it with both hands as soon as the 
experimenter came into the room with it in his arms. The front 
light was turned on. The rabbit was held out to her. She 
reached for it at once with both hands, trying to put her fingers 
in its eyes. She caught hold of a piece of fur above the rabbit’s 
eye and pulled hard. 
Pigeon. The front light was turned out. She reached for the 
bird with her left hand before the experimenter was ready to pre- 
sent it to her. The pigeon’s wings were released and it fluttered 
violently just in front of the baby’s eyes. She continued to reach 
for it with both hands, even when the wings brushed her face.

When the bird was quiet it was presented to her again. She ! 
reached for it even more vigorously. She oe to take hold of the — 
pigeon’s beak with her left hand, but failed, because the bird 
continually bobbed its head. The front light was then turned or. 
The pigeon again flapped wildly. The baby looked at it intently 
with widely opened eyes, but this time did not reach. She showed 
no fear, however. It was then held out to her again when it had 
become quiet. She reached for it at once with both hands, held 
the feathers and tried to put her fingers into its eyes. 
April 27, 175 days old. The baby was placed in a small chair 
and tied in, and put behind a screen, so that she could not see 
any of the people in the room. The dog was allowed to walk 
suddenly around the screen in front of her. She showed no 
fear when the dog rubbed against her legs. She did not reach 
for him, however. While she was still in the same position, the 
experimenter held the pigeon in front of her and allowed it to 
flap its wings. She reached for it with both hands the moment 
it was presented to her, and did not withdraw her hands white 
the bird was flapping its wings. She continued to reach as the 
bird was moved out of her range. 
The cat was then brought around the screen and placed on 
the couch just in front of the baby’s chair. She did not reach 
for it, but followed it with her eyes. It was held very close to 
her. She reached for it with her left hand and touched its head. 
The cat was then moved away, but she continued to reach for it. 
Then the cat put: its front feet in her lap. She reached with her 
left hand and followed with her right, touching its ears. 
Rabbit. She reached with her left hand at once when the 
rabbit was still too far away to touch. When it came close to 
her she reached with her left hand and touched it. 
She was then taken into the dark room with both lights turned 
out and seated in a small chair. A newspaper was lighted before 
her and allowed to burn in a large metal bucket. She watched it 
intently from the moment the match was struck until the flames 
died down. She showed no fear, but did not attempt to reach.® 
While being tested in the large room for eye-hand codrdina- 
tion, the dog suddenly began to bark at some one entering the 
room. He was quite near the baby. He barked loudly and 
jumped about at the end of the leash. The baby became per- 
fectly still, watching intently with widely opened eyes, blinking 
at each bark, but did not ery.   
* When tested seven days later with this she wet her napkin, but no 
general fear reaction appeared (possibly normal bladder reflex).

  May 1, 178 days old. She was taken out to Druid Hill Park 
in an automobile for the first time in her life. She was wide 
awake the whole time. She was carried rather rapidly through 
the grounds of the small zoo at. the park. The camel was bray- 
ing and came up to the fence as we approached, rubbing rather 
violently against the fence, coming within a few feet of the baby. 
This produced no fear reaction and no constant fixation. She 
was then taken to the cages containing the cinnamon and black 
bears. She gazed at them from time to time, but with no constant 
fixation. We then took her into the monkey house which con- 
tained also a large number of parrots and other smaller birds 
The monkeys came to the sides of the cage, and from time to time 
attacked the wires. Three or four times they came up and made 
threatening movements, and actually caught the experimenter by 
the arm. The child did not seem to be in the least afraid. The 
peacocks were making their rather uncanny sounds withir 
twenty feet of her, but she did not turn her eyes towards th 
source of the sound. She was then taken back to the came 
yard, and the camel again ‘‘performed’’ nicely. Two camel 
came up to each other and rubbed noses and put their heads ove 
the dividing fence. The baby was within two or three inche 
of the camel’s nose on several occasions, but while she followe 
the movements with her eyes, she showed no pronounced reaction 
of any kind. She was then taken to the Shetland pony, wh 
put his nose through the wires and showed his teeth. She we 
within a few inches of his mouth. Outside of following mow 
ments of the eyes, no reactions were observable. She was take 
near two zebras. They came to the edge of the fence, within 
few inches of the baby. The zebras were possibly followe 
slightly more intently with the eyes, but there was no other o] 
servable reaction. While the baby was watching the zebras a 
ostrich came close to her and brought its head to the wire bi 
did not strike the wire violently. During approximately ha 
of the experiment the baby was carried by her mother and tl 
rest of the time by the experimenter’s assistant. She had nev 
been carried by this individual before. At times the mother wi 
kept out of the range of the baby’s vision. 
Baby Nixon, a girl, 126 days of age, had just learned the ey 
hand codrdination. She was put through exactly the same seri 
of situations. Slight differences appeared, e.g., when the e 
rubbed its head against the baby’s stomac# there was a distin 
start, a tendency to stiffen. While the ex -rimenter was out

She was being held by a stranger. Suddenly the baby began to 
ery, and had to be given to the mother for a few moments. She 
quieted down immediately. Again when the pigeon flapped its 
_ wings near the baby’s face, she gave a distinct jump, but did not. 
ery or show other signs of fear. When the dog was made to 
bark (lighted room), the baby blinked her eyes at every bark, 
but gave no other reaction. She smiled throughout most of the 
situations. She smiled all through the burning of the paper 
in the dark room. 
It is thus seen that this unusual opportunity of testing chil- 
*dren’s reactions to their first sight of animals yielded few definite 
results. At least we can say that the older statements which 
maintain that violent emotions appear must be very greatly modi- 
fied. Of course, it is always possible that the children were too 
young, but this has not very much weight, since we have tested 
children from birth through to 200 days. These children left 
the hospital shortly after the tests and further experimentation 
eould not be made. As a control test, similar observations were 
made upon a colored baby girl (Lee) 200 days of age, who had 
been under observation from birth. She lived in the city under 
the usual environmental conditions. Exactly the same results 
were obtained. There was practically no evidence of fear. 
Are There Other Original Emotional Patterns?—It is thus 
seen that so far our attempts to bring out emotional patterns dis- 
_ tinct from those enumerated on page 199 have been barren of 
result. If it were possible to continue such experiments through 
a much longer span of a child’s life, and if we could face him 
with a much larger number of situations that more nearly 
touched his daily life activities, it might be possible to extend 
the list. It is realized that we are working here with very young 
members of the human species. <A good deal of organization 
and development takes place after two hundred days. Some very 
complex situations have yet to be faced, such as masturbation 
(and in boys especially, the first masturbation after puberty) ; 
period in girls; complex situations con- 
, Such as quarrels between the parents, 
the death of loved ones, all of which —

  HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: EMOTIONS 227 
vation that these do become hitched up to emotional reactions; 
whether they are original or transferred does not appear from 
our studies. It would be especially desirable to study the reaction 
states we now designate by the names of shame and shyness and 
embarrassment in this connection. We are of the opinion that 
most of the asserted emotions are of the consolidated type (that is, 
emotion plus instinct, plus habit) or emotional attitudes. These 
are discussed on page 238. 
Attention is called here to the limitations of the genetic method. 
As long as we can keep the baby under constant observation, a 
great deal of simplification can be obtained in the study of the 
emotions, but the human infant is a part of a social group and 
must sooner or later be returned to it. Things happen so fast 
then that a separate tabulation of events cannot be made. Under 
ordinary conditions, the emotions ,take care of themselves in a 
normal child, that is, society, including, of course, the parents 
and the family group, furnishes its own corrective for failure to 
react emotionally, for wrong emotional reaction and for over or 
under reactions. All too often, due mainly to defective environ- 
ment, seldom to defective heredity, the emotions may go wrong. 
The genetic method is not of service. The emotional life of the 
individual must then be studied by the psychopathologist. Again, 
in business and professional life (especially in the Army and 
Navy), more and more emphasis is being placed upon what may 
be called emotional temperament. It is thus evident that the 
applied psychologist must have some means of making studies 
of emotional activity in adults. Finally, the scientific psychol- 
ogist, for methodological and purely technical reasons, devises 
methods for the study of emotions in the hope that they will 
yield scientific results, or that his methods may prove of such 
value that they can be employed by the psychopathologist, by 
the criminologist and by the applied psychologist. A’ short ac- 
count of the methods which can be used where the genetic method 
is not applicable follows. 
Methods Employed in the Detection of Implicit Emotional 
Response.—The explicit portions of the pattern reaction in emo- 
tion are, as we have tried to indicate, usually the least important 
   
-P-A-G-E-242
  228 PSYCHOLOGY 
constituent. When they appear, systematic observation enables 
us to note them with sufficient scientific accuracy. In the study 
of criminals, of psychogenic disorders and of normal individuals, 
often all explicit emotional manifestations disappear. The excit- 
ing situation is complex. On the one hand, it inhibits overt vocal 
response, but initiates a train of (visceral) implicit activity. 
Questioning the subject may reveal nothing. He may deny that 
the stimulus produced any reaction whatever, and yet the next 
moment he may drop his cigarette, bite his nails, or hesitate or 
stumble over a word. Popularly we speak in such cases of deceit, 
concealment of the emotion, ‘‘repressions,’’ ete. In many cases, 
however, the individual would report his observations upon him- 
self correctly, if he could observe them, but the movements may 
be of such a fleeting character as to escape observation, or 
his intellectual level may be of such a low grade that he cannot 
make the observation. In such cases there are often so many 
disturbing factors that self-observation is not possible. Several 
methods are in use by means of which we can detect the implicit 
side of emotion. 
(1) The Word Reaction Method; Free Type.—The sub- 
ject is told to respond immediately with a word to a given visual 
or auditory word stimulus. The stimulus words are made up 
before the test. Some of the words are neutral words, the others 
are the ‘‘significant’’? words which refer to the emotional situa- 
tion. The indicators of implicit response or tension obtained 
from the subject are unduly long reactions (with occasional ap- 
pearance of explicit forms such as the giggle, dropping the eyes, 
a flush) ; significant response words, showing that the stimulus 
word was a part of the emotional setting; repetition of the same 
word; too rapid responses; low level ‘responses; failure in re- 
sponses (there are several variations in this method). 
(2) The Continuous Type—The subject is started on any 
selected. word, possibly a fragment from a dream, and told: to 
“speak the words as they come.’’? He begins. For a time the 
words come freely and then they fail. There is blockage. New 
associated lines are begun. Sooner or later, however, in dis- 
turbed cases all lines seem to converge and blockage occurs 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
eee ae 
| HEREDITARY MODES OF BESEONSE: EMOTIONS 229 aS 
“whatever the start may have been. The blockage seems to occur 
at the point where the words relating to the emotionally exciting 
object belong in the associated train of words. 
(3) Dream study and analysis often reveal emotional tension. 
They may be studied by the common-sense method of question- 
ing the patient now from one angle, now from another, but they 
are often analyzed by employing the two methods described above 
singly or in combination. Dreams are a part of a person’s sum 
total of reactions. They are as good indicators of the nature of 
his personality, of his stresses and strains and emotional life gen- 
erally, as are any of his other activities. We have already stated 
that we can judge the emotional level of an individual by watch- 
ing his daily routine of activity. To make this statement com- 
plete, the dream activity in sleep and day-dreams must be taken 
into account. These are word reactions but not isolated reactions 
or reactions of the musele-twitch kind. They are connected and 
associated activity, fully as complete oftentimes as housebuild- 
ing, delivering a lecture, or putting through a big business deal. 
The study of dreams, since the dream language is extremely sym- 
bolic, requires individuals especially trained in that field. 
(4) The study of slips of word or pen, poor adjustments, 
over and under reactions, bodily postures and attitudes. These 
can be studied by general observation and by the methods which 
are employed in the study of dreams. 
In discussing these methods, it should be stated that the psy- 
chologist busies himself with them principally from a methodo- 
logical standpoint, that is, by determining the range of appli- 
eability, their reliability, the best technic, ete. The psycho- 
pathologist uses them for practical purposes. The reshaping and 
rebalancing of a personality often depends upon the finding of 
situations connected with an emotion, or upon finding out whether 
there is an emotion where normally there should be one. He 
uses all of the above methods, and in addition his common-sense, 
combining it all with general observation of the patient’s whole 
personality. In gathering his data, it is often necessary and 
desirable for him to question the patient upon the significant 
events of his life history; the things he is naturally inclined to 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  230 PSYCHOLOGY 
do and inclined not to do (positive and negative reaction tenden- 
cies) ; the books he has read, the way they affected him; the types 
of situation in real or dramatic life which influenced him most; 
his main emotional assets; the easiest way to get an emotional 
rise out of him; the trend of his day-dreams and the types of air- 
eastles he builds; what his chief lines of sensitiveness are; his 
conflicts and temptations, and the way he finds himself meeting 
these difficulties. A full discussion of these factors requires more 
space than we can give. We return to them again on page 423. 
In addition to the above methods, others are being developed. 
(5) The determination of increased sugar in the blood or 
urine before and after presentation of a stimulus when there is 
reason to infer that the stimulus is not without significance 
(page 241). 
(6) The emotional questionary of Woodworth, and the vari- 
ous character analysis outlines. The subject answers by ‘‘yes’’ 
or ‘‘no’’ a series of questions, such as: Were you considered a 
bad boy? Were you shy with other boys? Do you know of 
anybody who is trying to do you harm? Did you ever make 
love to a girl? Have you ever had any great mental shock? 
Does it make you uneasy to have to cross a wide street or an open 
oe. Did you ever feel a strong desire to steal things? Did 
er have the habit of biting your finger nails? Do your 
feelings keep changing from happy to sad and from sad to happy 
without any reason? Have you ever been afraid of going insane? 
If there is unstable emotional temperament, the fact is supposed 
to be revealed by the nature of the answers. 
(7) The so-called psycho-galvanic reflex. Here the subject 
sits in a quiet room with two non-polarizable electrodes upon two 
parts of the body. The electrodes are connected to a sensitive 
galvanometer. A definite deflection of the needle is obtained. 
Emotional stimuli are then given, and their effect noted by the 
deflection of the needle. So far in our laboratory this method 
has not been found serviceable. It is hoped, however, that with an 
improved technic, the action currents in the heart revealed by 
the string galvanometer can be made to yield serviceable results. 
(8) The so-called expressive methods. These consist of the
-P-A-G-E-245
HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: EMOTIONS 231 
recording of the respiratory changes, vaso-motor changes; auto- 
matie writing and drawing (planchette). Such methods in gen- 
eral have proven of slight value. The respiratory curve is a very 
sensitive indicator (showing conditioned reflexes quite clearly), 
but it is subject to so many influences that the significant changes 
are often obscured and their interpretation is made difficult. 
This is equally true of vaso-motor changes. 
Conditioned Emotional Reactions.—Under the action of en- 
vironmental factors (habit influences) situations which ‘origi- 
nally did not call out emotional response come later to do so. This 
enlargement of the range of stimuli capable of calling out emo- 
tional activity is responsible largely for the complexity we see in 
the emotional life of the adult. Until recently no experimental 
work has been done which would show such conditioned emo- 
tional responses in the making. 
Recently, in the’ Hopkins laboratory, the following experi- 
ments were tried upon Albert B., an eleven-month old infant 
weighing 21 pounds. This infant was rather stolid and phlegma- 
tie, but extremely well and healthy. 
Albert was the son of one of the wet nurses. He had lived his 
entire life in the hospital. He had been under continuous obser- 
vation by the experimenters almost from birth.* 
To start the experiment it became necessary to use § 
simple native or fundamental stimulus which would produce fear 
(corresponding to the electrical shock). We have already pointed 
out that loud sounds are the most potent of all such stimuli. We 
determined to take Albert and attempt to condition fear to a white 
rat by showing him the rat and as soon as he reached for it 
and touched it, to strike a heavy steel bar behind him. We 
first showed by repeated tests that Albert feared nothing 
except loud sounds (and removal of support). Everything 
coming within twelve inches of him was reached for and 
manipulated. This was true of animals, persons and things. 
His reaction, however, to the sound of the steel bar was charac-   
*For a fuller report of this experiment see “Studies in Infant 
Psychology,” John B. Watson and Rosalie Rayner Watson, Scientific 
Monthly, December, 1921, p. 493. .

teristic and what we had been led to believe is true of most if 
not all infants. When it was suddenly sounded behind him for 
the first time there was a sudden intake of the breath and an 
upward fling of the arms. On the second stimulation the lips 
began to pucker and tremble, on the third he broke into a crying 
fit, turned to one side and began to crawl away as rapidly as — 
possible with head averted. 
The result of this observation showing that the loud sound 
would call out the fear response gave us hope that we might 
be able to use this stimulus for bringing about a conditioned emo- 
tional response just as the electric shock combined with the sight 
of a colored object brings about in the end a conditioned motor 
response of the finger. Our laboratory notes showing the prog- 
ress of this test are most convincing. 
Eleven months, three days old. (1) White rat suddenly taken from the 
basket and presented to Albert. He began to reach for rat with left hand. 
Just as his hand touched the animal the bar was struck immediately 
behind his head. The infant jumped violently and fell forward, burying 
his face in the mattress. He did not ery, however. 
(2) Just as his right hand touched the rat the bar was again struck. 
Again the infant jumped violently, fell forward and began to whimper. 
In order not to disturb the child too seriously no further tests 
were given for one week. 
Eleven months, ten days old. (1) Rat presented suddenly without 
sound. There was steady fixation but no tendency at first to reach for it. 
The rat was then placed nearer, whereupon tentative reaching move- 
ments began with the right hand. When the rat nosed the infant’s left 
hand the hand was immediately withdrawn. He started to reach for the 
head of the animal with the forefinger of his left hand but withdrew 
it suddenly before contact. It is thus seen that the two joint stimula- 
tions given last week were not without effect. He was tested with 
his blocks immediately afterwards to see if they shared in the process 
‘of conditioning. He began immediately to pick them up, dropping 
them and pounding them, ete. In the remainder of the tests the blocks 
were given frequently to quiet him and to test his general emotional 
state. They were always removed from sight when the process of con- 
ditioning was under way. 
(2) Combined stimulation with rat and sound. Started, then fell 
over immediately to right side. No erying. 
(3) Combined stimulation. Fell to right side and rested on hands 
with head turned from rat. No erying.
-P-A-G-E-247
  HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: EMOTIONS 233 
(4) Combined stimulation. Same reaction. 
(5) Rat suddenly presented alone. Puckered face, whimpered and 
withdrew body sharply to left. 
(6) Combined stimulation. Fell over immediately to right side 
and began to whimper. 
(7) Combined stimulation. Started violently and cried, but did 
not fall over. 
(8) Rat alone. The instant the rat was shown the baby began to 
cry. Almost instanlty he turned sharply to the left, fell over, raised 
himself on all fours and began to crawl away so rapidly that he was 
caught with difficulty before he reached the edge of the table. 
This was as convincing a case of a completely conditioned fear 
response as could have been theoretically pictured. It is not 
unlikely had the sound been of greater intensity and the child 
more delicately organized that one or two combined stimulations 
might have been sufficient to condition the emotion. We thus 
see how easily such conditioned fears may grow up in the home. 
A child that has gone to bed for years without a light with 
no fears may, through the loud slamming of doors or through 
a sudden loud clap of thunder, become conditioned to darkness. 
We can easily explain how it is that a sudden flash of lightning 
finds you all set and tense, often times with the hands over the 
ears, before the clap of thunder, which is the true stimulus to 
such action, occurs. We can thus see further how it is that the 
sight of a nurse that constrains the movements of the youngster 
or dresses it badly may cause the infant to go into a rage, or 
how the momentary glimpse of a maiden’s bonnet may produce 
the emotional reactions of love in her swain. 
Transferred Conditioned Emotional Reactions.—The experi- 
mental question arose as to whether Albert would be afraid 
henceforth only of rats, or whether the fear would be trans- 
ferred to other animals and possibly to other objects. To answer 
this question Albert was brought back into the laboratory five 
days later and tested. Our laboratory notes again show the 
results most convincingly. 
Eleven months, fifteen days old. (1)' Tested first with blocks. He 
reached readily for them, playing with them as usual. This shows 
that there has been no general transfer to the room, table, blocks, ete,
-P-A-G-E-248
    234 PSYCHOLOGY 
(2) Rat alone. Whimpered immediately, withdrew right hand and 
turned head and trunk away. 
(3) Blocks again offered. Played readily with them, smiling 
and gurgling. 
(4) Rat alone. Leaned over to the left side as far away from the 
rat as possible, then fell over, getting up on all fours and scurrying away 
as rapidly as possible. 
(5) Blocks again offered. Reached immediately for them, smiling 
and laughing as before. 
The above preliminary test shows that the conditioned response 
to the rat had carried over completely for the five days in which 
no tests were given. The question as to whether or not there 
is a transfer was next taken up. 
(6) Rabbit alone. A rabbit was suddenly placed on the mattress in 
front of him. The reaction was pronounced. Negative responses began 
at once. He leaned as far away from the animal as possible, whimpered, 
then burst into tears. When the rabbit was placed in contact with 
him he buried his face in the mattress, then got up on all fours and 
erawled away, crying as he went. This was a most convincing test. 
(7) The blocks were next given him, after an interval. He played 
with them as before. It was observed by four people that he played far 
more energetica) them than ever before. The blocks were raised 
high over his GOND sine down with a great deal of force. 
: (8) Dog alohe. The dog did not produce as violent a reaction as the 
rabbit. The moment fixation of the eyes occurred the child shrank back 
and as the animal came nearer he attempted to get on all fours but did 
not ery at first. As soon as the dog passed out of his range of vision 
he became quiet. The dog was then made to approach the infant’s 
head (he was lying down at the moment). Albert straightened up 
immediately, fell over to the opposite side and turned his head away. 
He then began to ery. 
(9) Blocks were again presented. He began immediately to play 
with them. 
(10) Fur coat (seal). Withdrew immediately to the left side and 
began to fret. Coat put close to him on the left side, he turned im- 
mediately, began to ery and tried to crawl away on all fours. 
(11) Cotton wool. The wool was presented in a paper package. At 
the ends the cotton was not covered by the paper. It was placed first” 
on his feet. He kicked it away but did not touch it with his hands. 
When his hand was laid on the wool he immediately withdrew it but 
did not show the shock that the animals or fur coat produced in him.

He then began to play with the paper, avoiding contact with the wool 
itself. He finally, under the impulse of the manipulative instinct, lost 
some of his negativism to the wool. 
(12) Just in play W. put his head down to see if Albert would play 
with his hair. Albert was completely negative. The two other observers 
did the same thing. He began immediately to play with their hair. A 
Santa Claus mask was then brought and presented to Albert. He was 
again pronouncedly negative, although on all previous occasions he had 
played with it. 
We see that the conditioned fear to the rat, which was experi- 
mentally set up, transferred to many other objects.‘ The transfer 
was immediate and without_any additional experience in con- 
nection with these other objects.: In these transferred emotional 
reactions we thus would find a reason for the widespread change 
in the personality of children and possibly even of adults once 
even a single strongly conditioned emotional reaction has been 
set up to any object or situation. It accounts for the many 
unreasonable fears and for a good deal of the sensitiveness of 
individuals to objects for which no adequate ground for such 
behavior can be offered in the past history of that individual. 
The importance of such a factor in shaping the life of the child 
needs no further emphasis from us. 
The most important question for the a! sychologist is 
““ How can these conditioned fear, rage and love responses be 
removed? ’’ The conditioned love responses are probably more 
serious even than the fears and tantrums, since they are not only 
tolerated by society but even encouraged by it. In our opinion 
conditioned love responses, especially those directed towards the 
mother and father, breeding too great dependence upon the 
parents as they do (p. 250), are probably the most sinister fae- 
tors in the whole system of human organization. Even if 
choanalysis could re-condition the individual, it would be too 
late—these attachments, beginning in infaney and continuing 
- throughout the adolescent period, thwart and block organization 
along other lines. The adult possessing these infantile habits 
is and must remain unbalanced from the standpoint of his total 
organization, The research psychologists in the infant behavior 
, once they are established will in time learn how to 
   
-P-A-G-E-250

remove these conditioned emotional reactions. Rivotibhal re-con- 
ditioning bids fair to become as important to society as medi- 
cine. But until parents in turn are trained in the 
rearing of children, re-conditioning will be an andless process. 
The parents can establish new entanglements for the helpless 
child faster than the behaviorist can break them down. 
Summary of Experimental Findings.—In general, then, it 
seems safe to say that when an emotionally exciting ob- 
ject stimulates the subject simultaneously with one not 
emotionally exciting, the latter may in time (often after one 
such joint stimulation) arcuse the same emotional reaction as the 
former. It is probable that conditioned reflexes of the second, 
third and succeeding orders are also continually arising. In the 
process, the reaction pattern probably gets broken up to a large 
extent. Part reactions belonging to love, rage and fear might all 
appear in the reaction to such a substituted stimulus. 
In addition to this sudden and abrupt type of substitution, 
which undoubtedly belongs in the class of conditioned reflexes, 
there are the ‘‘attachments’’ and ‘‘detachments”’ to persons, 
places and things which come by the slow process of habit con- 
nection. They probably do not differ in origin from the type 
just considered except for the increased length of time required 
er their formation. 
‘Emotional Outlets: Diffusion—On page 217 we spoke of 
FI ges in the general level of activity due to emotional disturb- 
ance. We spoke there of a normal, of a high and of a low level. 
Probably if an individual were perfectly balanced, the distribu- 
tion of emotional activity would be uniform and all organized 
activity would share equally, that is, there would be a mere 
change in level. But few individuals possess that perfect balance 
which would make this possible. Furthermore, society and one’s 
own organization often make emotional outlets impossible along 
certain lines. When emotional expression is blocked in any one 
region, outlet seems to take place somewhere else. An illustra- 
tion will make the point clear: A is insulted by|a larger man, or 
by an older or a younger man, or by one from whot he i is receiv- 
ing his daily bread. The instinct and habit o 
      
-P-A-G-E-251
  
HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE EMOTIONS 237 
would lead to an attack, or at least to its equivalent—a strong 
verbal retort. But other features in the total situation (the fact 
that he is larger, older, younger, etc.) inhibit these outlets. The 
emotional pressure, however, has been aroused. He may pro- 
ceed to his office, fire his bookkeeper or office boy or terrorize his 
stenographer. One’s family often suffers most in such cases. If 
a man’s wife causes the emotional rise, the children are apt to 
suffer. The outlet, however, may not always be a harsh word 
or a blow. If the emotion partakes of the fear or rage com- 
ponents, the blow or harsh word is most frequent. If the thwarted 
emotion is of the love type, the final outlet may be exhibited by 
showering kind words or benefits upon some one other than the 
person ealling out but thwarting the love emotion. If the 
thwarting is brought about by the death of the loved object, the 
outlet may be found in grief or suicide. 
Human life is full of such outlets. If society as a whole puts 
on too many restrictions (rage) and the thwarted individual is 
not well-balanced, the outlet may be through burglary or vandal- 
ism. In balanced individuals it may have its outlet through 
swearing or in privately railing at the restrictions of society. 
In certain individuals, either through inferior constitution or 
the narrowness or restrictiveness of their environment, no ex- 
ternal outlet seems to be possible. The emotional drainage 
expresses itself in some form of attitude (page 239) ; by with- 
drawing or shrinkage from contact with fellow humans of any 
kind; in drink or drugs; in ruminations, day-dreams and air- 
castles—that is, there is a language outlet. 
The point which rationalizes all such behavior seems to be, 
namely, that the individual by so reacting gets relaxation and 
freedom from emotional pressure. Popularly we speak of 
‘working off’’ the emotion, that ‘‘one’s rage is cooled’’ by this 
or that. The study of these various outlets when they assume 
pathological form and interfere with the remaining actions 
of the individual or of those organized functions which society 
demands of each individual, and of the reshaping of such 
individuals, belongs to psychiatry. We see, however, the same 
factors at work even in ‘‘normal’’ individuals, and our training

as psychologists is not complete until we are able to note the 
signs of emotional mal-adjustment. 
We have not the evidence at hand to affirm the view that all 
of the phenomena seen in diffusion belong to the conditioned re- 
flex realm. The activity seems to be tog little stereotyped and 
entirely too complex to belong in that category. The attachment 
is not focalized. Probably the simplest way of stating the gen- 
erally observed fact is that too great emotional pressure is drained 
off through whatever channel environmental (social) and hered- 
itary factors make possible. 
oot Consolidation Among Emotion, Instinct and Habit; Atti- 
~  tudes.—Observation seems to show that combinations or integra- 
tions occur.among emotional, instinctive and habit activities. 
Our discussion of these integrations will be handicapped to some 
extent by our not having had opportunity to study instinct and 
habit. Possibly the activities we see in ‘‘anger’’ or its more active 
attitude, ‘‘fighting,’’ best illustrate the points to be presented. 
Anger as we see it exhibited in the insect world probably remains 
on the emotion-instinct, level (hereditary). Habit activities are 
at a minimum in these animals (though not wholly lacking). In 
the human race certainly the exciting stimulus is usually one 
which hampers, jostles, crowds or constratfis the individual—the 
stimulus to rage. The instinctive factors are striking out with 
the arms and hands, grasping, running toward the object, prob- 
ably biting it, the while unfleshing the teeth. Defensive move- 
ments also occur of the instinctive kind. The habit factors ex- 
press themselves in the scientific ‘‘form’’ of attack and defense: 
the way the arms are held to avoid giving the enemy an opening, 
planting the blow. on a vulnerable spot—the eyes or the solar 
plexus, ete.—and in the stance of the feet. The whole group is 
integrated, the part reactions work together. The individual 
becomes a fighting-defending, unitary action mass. If the envi- 
ronmental factors are such that actual fighting cannot oceur, the 
subject assumes the ‘‘defiant’’ attitude. \All three factors are still 
present even in the attitude. \Many of the emotion, instinet and 
habit action tendencies are constrained by social factors. The 
emphasis has then, of course, to fall back on the i 
tional components of the action mass.        
-P-A-G-E-253
  
HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: EMOTIONS 239 
In the above, rage predominated as the emotional constituent, 
the hereditary attack and defense movement as the instinct, 
and the trained activities as the habitual. Probably all other 
forms of emotion—those of the native or more fundamental 
type, as love and fear, and the broken up, combined and con- 
solidated types which we get through substitution—show the 
types of combination shown above. To attempt to list these, to 
show their history and formation through the process of substi- 
tution and consolidation, would require a volume (and a very - 
necessary one) of its own. Only a few will be touched upon here. 
The so-called submissive or inferiority attitude shows itself at 
once as having fear as the most prominent emotional elem nt 
The instinctive factor may not be clearly overt, but it is in gen- 
eal (B® manifests itself in shrinking, submission and avoiding 
—sométimes with the body as a whole, sometimes with spedial 
organs, as the lips or eyes. The habitual factor shows itself esjye- 
cially in the language behavior of the adult—hastening to agree, 
avoiding an argument, and the hesitant voice. 
In the sphere of love there are numerous attitudes as shown 
by the popular expressions ‘‘lovelorn,’’ ‘‘lovesick,’’ ‘‘tender- 
ness,’’ ‘‘sympathy.’’ More fundamental and prominent atti- 
tudes are those of ‘‘shyness,’’ ‘‘shame,’’ ‘‘embarrassment,’’ 
“Jealousy,” ‘‘envy,”’ ‘‘hate,” ‘‘pride,”’ ‘‘suspicion,’”’ ‘‘resent- 
ment,’’ ‘‘anguish’’ and ‘‘anxiety.’’ There are many combina- 
tions of emotional habit and instinctive factors in all of these \/ 
attitudes. “They actually function by limiting the range of 
stimuli to which the person is sensitive. For the individual 
they are fundamental attributes of character, as much a part 
of him as his arms or legs or his method of attacking a 
new problem. 
This very superficial analysis is not at all commensurate with 
the réle these attitudes play in the life of the individual. In 
studying the life history f any person we can see how they 
have oftentimes furthered or hindered his life work and disturbed 
his personal balance. Shyness and the inferiority attitude may 
keep a man tied all his life +6 an accustomed but unremunerative 
job. They have oftentimes prevented his marriage or brought 
about a poorly adjusted marriage or kept him out of a wider

social circle. On the other hand, in other cases too much aggres- 
siveness has just as often made impossible a man’s chances of 
making good business and social connections. 
Results of the Physiological Study of Emotions. A. Duce 
Glands and Smooth Muscles.—On page 31 and again in the 
discussion of the duct glands of the mouth and stomach (page 
194), we brought out the fact that when the human or animal sub- 
ject is under the influence of the stimulus of hunger (rhythmical 
contractions of stomach muscles) conditioned secretion reflexes 
occur when food (food positively reacted to) is allowed to stimu- 
late the animal visually or olfactorily. 
Under the influence of emotioral stimuli these part activities 
are often blocked: This aspect of the phenomena of secretion and 
movement of the smooth muscles of the stomach is undoubtedly 
a part of the physiological study of emotion. A number of ob- 
servers have shown that emotionally exciting situations do check 
the functioning of the glands. If a child with a gastric fistula 
is shown food and is then badgered by first handing it to him and 
then taking it away and then causing it to disappear from vision, 
erying and other definite signs of an emotional state appear. The 
secretions are checked. Similar conditions obtain in the case of 
dogs: if they are put in strange surroundings or if they are 
fastened in a holder, or finally if they are shown their natural 
enemy, the cat, the flow of secretion is checked. If the emotional 
state is long continued, in both man and animals even the uncon- 
ditioned reflexes may fail for some time, that is, the actual 
contact of the substance may fail to arouse the flow of the 
gastric juices. 
A similar phenomenon appears in connection with the peri- 
staltic movements of the stomach, and indeed of the movements in 
the muscular layer of the whole alimentary canal. Restraining 
the animal and covering its mouth and nose with the finger, check 
the stomach contractions very quickly. But we have just seen 
that stimuli of this kind nreauce the emotion of rage. The same 
phenomena appear in the case of ‘man. People under the influ- 
ence of fear and rage frequently a not digest their food (due 
to the checking of secretion) and the food remains in the stomach 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: EMOTIONS 241 
(due to lack of movements necessary to pass the contents of 
the canal along). f 
_ Excitation of the pain receptors has the same effect as emo- 
tional disturbance (probably is a stimulus to rage) both upon 
secretion and upon the stomach contractions. It is probable that 
any of the highly exciting emotions act in the same way as those 
discussed above. Sex emotions aroused by salacious photographs 
and pictures have a definite inhibitory effect upon the rate aad 
amount of secretion of the parotid gland and upon certain re- 
flexes (swallowing, for example). 
B. Effect of Exciting Stimuli upon the Ductless Glands.— 
Apparently one of the most important effects that emotional 
stimuli exert is the release of adrenin. The adrenin in turn lib- 
erates sugar from the stored supply in the liver, often in amounts 
greater than the body can consume. Glycosuria results, that is, 
the excess sugar passes over into the urine. This phenomenon 
often occurs in battle and in extreme emotional situations of any 
kind (depressing or exciting). Cannon states that young male 
cats when fastened in a holder become quite frantic, with' eyes 
wide open and pupils dilated; the pulse is accelerated and the 
hairs of the tail become more or less erect; they snarl and growl 
as they try to free themselves. Whenever this excited condition 
occurs there is glycosuria (in from forty minutes to an hour and 
a half). When a small dog is allowed to bark at the cats, caus- 
ing them to become excited, the glycosuria manifests itself. Sim- 
ilar results occur in the case of the human being. After hard 
examinations or exciting athletic contests, students show tem- 
porary glycosuria. 
When glycosuria occurs, it is an indication of an increased 
supply of sugar in the blood, since so long as the kidneys are 
uninjured the sugar cannot pass out through the urine until an 
excessive supply of sugar is at hand. Testing for sugar in the 
urine is really a very coarse method of detecting the emotional 
effect of a stimulus. Recently very sensitive methods have been 
discovered for detecting the presence of increase of sugar in the 
blood. A large amount of material has collected in our laboratory 
as the: peaue of blood sugas tests. It is unquestionably a very 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
242 PSYCHOLOGY 
delicate indicator and revealer of emotional changes. It has been 
used in connection with the association word reaction method. 
This joint method may be utilized as follows: One individual does 
a certain act while a second subject remains quietly in another 
room. The two return to the experimental room and the experi- 
menter must decide from the word responses (hesitations, ete.) 
which one of the individuals performed the act in question. A 
small amount (few drops) of blood is obtained from both indi- 
viduals both before the test is made and after, and the percent- 
age of blood sugar is determined in all four specimens. The 
individual having committed the ‘‘crime’’ shows as a result the 
greater increase in blood sugar. The blood sugar reaction can 
thus be used as a supplementary method of detecting ‘‘guilt.’’ 
The method is probably delicate enough to decide whether 
a given individual is emotionally aroused by the mere presence 
of another individual. These results were obtained by Dr. N. 
D. C. Lewis in our laboratory. They have not yet been pub- 
lished. It has been shown conclusively in animals that if the adre- 
nal glands are removed emotional stimuli will not cause this 
increase in sugar either in the blood or in the urine. The con- 
elusion is well sustained, then, that emotional stimuli through 
a reflex mechanism set free adrenin which in turn acts upon the 
supply of sugar in the liver and converts it into a form which 
can be used by the muscles after it gets into the blood stream. 
In addition to its sugar conversion effect upon the liver, 
adrenin acts in conjunction with the sympathetic nerves and 
produces vaso-constriction and hence an increased blood-pressure. 
It has been shown that when a given muscle is active, its blood- 
vessels dilate, thus tending to decrease arterial pressure. If 
many muscles are called into action at any given moment, these 
dilated vessels may so reduce arterial pressure that the muscles 
fail to get their proper food. Waste products also accumulate 
in the muscles. Adrenin beeause of its reinforcing effect upon 
the vaso-constrictor nerves produces heightened arterial pres- 
sure, which increases the food supply | to the muscle and removes 
waste products. The blood is driven 0 out of the vegetative organs 
of the interior into the skeletal musdes, which have to meet the 7 S 
 
-P-A-G-E-257
he ea 
HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: EMOTIONS 243 
extra demand when the animal is fighting and struggling to 
free itself. 
C. Specific Effect of Adrenin—There seems to be general 
agreement that the free adrenin in the blood acts directly upon 
the muscle in such a way as to neutralize fatigue products. 
“What rest will do only after an hour or more, adrenin will do 
in five minutes or less’? (Cannon). This result is in addition 
to adrenin’s function in producing a greater food supply to 
the muscle and increasing the amount of blood circulating 
through the muscle. After a muscle has been fatigued, that is, 
has lost its irritability, the injection of adrenin in the blood (or 
stimulation of the splanchnic nerve) will rapidly restore the 
muscle to its resting condition. Cannon maintains that the 
presence of adrenin also hastens clotting of the blood, which in 
wounded animals might be advantageous. His results in this re- 
spect have not been wholly confirmed. 
Apparent Conflict Between Formulations.—There seems to 
be a conflict between our early statements about emotion and 
those gathered from the physiological studies just reported. We 
first expressed the view that if the emotional stimulus was strong 
enough or continued for a sufficient length of time paralysis or the 
death feint would occur. The state attained here is surely not 
adaptive. The result of the physiological study seemed to show 
that the organism under the influence of exciting stimuli often 
takes on a bettered state, one in which greater muscular activity 
and less fatigue is possible. The conflict can be harmonized. 
The ‘‘improved’’ physiological state is apparently due to the 
action of the autacoid substances. We saw on page 182 that such 
substances act like drugs. If a small amount of a certain drug, 
say strychnine, is administered, increased appetite and increased — 
muscular activity ensue. A bettered general physiological con- 
dition may result. On the other hand, if too large an amount is 
given, the muscles may become rigid and the subject may die. 
Possibly a similar thing happens in the case of the autacoids. If 
the substances are set free in too large amounts, there is one type 
of action, namely, the paralyzing effect. If set free in physio- 
logically serviceable amounts, their action may produce a com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
244 PSYCHOLOGY 
bined series of reflexes, the total result of which may be a bettered 
physiological state. 
The physiologists have unquestionably overemphasized the 
“‘adaptive’’ character in all of the major emotions. From Can- 
non’s work it is easy to see how under the emotions of rage, fear 
and pain stimulation the possibility of increased muscular effort 
might aid the organism in fighting or in flight. On the other hand, 
it is difficult to see how this physiological state plays any service- 
able réle in adjustment unless the organism is in a situation 
where the increased muscular possibilities are to be used ; but such 
situations are rare. A man in the army receives a letter telling 
him that his wife has given birth to a son. The news is 
undoubtedly a strong stimulus; excitement takes place and 
examination shows the presence of sugar in the urine, and natu- 
rally an increased supply in the blood, but his routine of camp 
activity happens to be such that no great muscular demand is 
made of him. We may grant Cannon’s general position and yet 
maintain that it is not a very serviceable concept for the ordi- 
nary routine of daily life. We are no longer living in a frontier 
country, and outside of an occasional war, there is not much 
opportunity to bare our teeth and struggle for existence in the 
good old primitive way of our ancestors. Cannon’s appeal to the 
biological serviceableness of the emotional reaction needs 
modification. 
There would seem to be no question but that the immediate 
effect of the exciting stimuli upon organized activity, as was 
brought out on page 216, is always disruptive. If an individual 
is preparing a lecture or writing a book or rendering a musical 
selection, any strong emotional stimulus at least temporarily dis- 
‘ rupts and blocks organized activity. The same thing would occur 
in the case of a group of officers if while preparing plans to make 
an attack on the enemy the following day, a shell were to burst 
and tear down a portion of the building in which they were 
working. It would thus seem necessary to state that the imme- 
\. diate effect of an exciting stimulus is ‘‘unadaptive,’’ disassocia- 
tive and disruptive. The immediate effect may endure for an 
extremely short time, or for a longer time. We have found that
-P-A-G-E-259
HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: EMOTIONS 245 
the increased blood sugar may endure for several hours even 
after fairly slight emotional stimulation. There is thus a post- 
shock or post-emotional state. Apparently the post-emotional 
state may be of such a character that (1) the organism is left 
less well adjusted and less capable of carrying out organized 
activities. As an example of this, the death of a child may leave 
the mother in a depressed and apathetic condition which may 
endure for months. On the other hand, (2) the post-emotional 
state may be of such a character that the organism is in a bettered 
physiological state; the activities going on before the emotional 
stimulus appeared may be resumed under a condition of facilita- 
tion and reinforcement. An example of this occurs when a 
parent punishes a child: there may be immediate improvement 
noticeable in his whole behavior (but the reverse may also hap- 
pen; the child may be thrown into a sullen state which might 
endure for some time). As a less ambiguous example, take the 
ease of an individual working at a low ebb. He receives a letter 
containing a check which, while it blocks his activity for the 
moment, has as its post-emotional effect a tremendous influence 
upon the speed and accuracy of his work for the remainder of the 
day or even for a longer period. In general we may say that the 
effect of an emotion arousing stimulus upon the general level of 
activity may produce facilitation or the reverse; or it may leave 
the level unchanged. What result will oceur depends upon a 
great many factors: the nature of the exciting stimulus, the 
individual’s character, his general bodily state, ete. 
Réle of Emotion in Daily Life-—The main fact about emo- 
tion seems to be that the human organism is built to react, in 
emotional ways. We stated in the beginning that those ways are 
inherited modes of action. Consequently it is not incumbent upon 
us as psychologists th give any detailed statement as to their 
biological serviceablefess in keeping the race alive. We should 
be content with deseribing the facts and pointing out the réle 
that emotion plays im our development and in our daily life. Of 
course, if one is terribly overawed by Darwin, one cannot rest 
until he has pointed out in detail the utilitarian value of every 
reaction. We are inclined to believe that in both instinct and 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
ee ee ee ee i 
| 246 PSYCHOLOGY 
‘ emotion there are many part reactions which are of no adaptive 
value to the organism whatsoever. We find here what we shall ~ 
find more strongly emphasized in our discussion of instincts, 
namely, that if the organism possesses enough hereditary strue- 
tures and modes of reaction to enable it to get along in its environ- 
ment, the process of evolution (selection or elimination) allows it 
to possess many luxuries in the way of reaction possibilities. 
‘We do not mean to assume by these precautionary remarks 
that emotions are without significance in daily life. We would 
emphasize the point that they can and do exist whether biologi- 
eally they are always useful, or useful only at times. (1) Even 
though they were mere luxuries, so far as biological fitness is 
eoneerned, they keep the individual from existing as a machine 
that runs the same way everyday. They give him his ups and\_ 
downs, make the exact prediction of his acts more difficult 
(troubling the psychologist and psychiatrist thereby), and in 
general make him a more delightful personality with whom 
to work, fight and play. The world would be a sorry place 
indeed, from an artistic and human standpoint, if the dis- 
tress of the child, of the weak and downtrodden move no eye 
to tears. Fame and ambition would be sorry crowns if the 
multitude were not moved to acclaim. If all hearts were calm, 
the great artists would have lived in vain. In a sense society 
hangs together because of the possibility of emotional rapproche- 
ment. (2) As regards their effect upon the possibilities of the 
achievement of the individual, we are inclined to agree with Wil- 
liam James in his Energies of Men, that in very exceptional 
eases the heightened state which comes after a great emotional 
crisis may bring about a degree of achievement that could not 
be dreamed of at the ordinary working level of the individual. 
Poe, De Quincey, Byron, Goethe and Geokge Sand would prob- 
ably never have produced their masterpieces under a humdrum 
régime. One can take selected cases. and marshal an imposing 
array of such instances. On the other hand, one must preserve 
one’s balance in making the assumption that because a few geni- 
uses have produced great works unde: 
tension, such exalted states make for o1    
       
-P-A-G-E-261
HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: EMOTIONS 247 
point seems to be that occasionally under a great tension all part 
reactions hang together and mutually facilitate one another— 
every asset and every resource of the individual, as long as the 
effect of the emotional state persists, are marshaled for the work 
in hand. Such occasions are rare. The next emotional shock 
might as its after-effect leave the individual trembling, enervated 
and flat; totally incapable of accomplishing anything except the 
merest routine. We all know from our own diaries of ourselves 
that under ordinary cireumstances if we have a fine piece of 
work to do, a championship game to play, a delicate piece of 
apparatus to manipulate, a fine surgical operation to perform, we 
would not willingly expose ourselves to any strong emotional * 
situation; and yet the brilliancy of our performance might be 
increased thereby. Certainly in history such achievements have 
been accomplished under such conditions. Possibly the shelter- 
ing which comes from civilization has built up an attitude of tim- 
idity, thereby lessening our readiness to take the chances which 
our predecessors had to take. Society more and more guards 
against the presence of strong emotional stimuli, since the weak 
and possibly even the individual of average ability cannot with- 
stand their effects, however well the genius may thrive under 
their influence. 
It is true that the illustrations in which we see the bad 
effects of emotional shock have been chosen from activities that 
demand gross, explicit forms of adjustment. Would the case be 
different with more constructive language types of activities? 
Would the plan of a novel, the writing of a poem, the paint- 
ing of a masterpiece, the composition of a great opera, be facili- 
tated, or the reverse, by producing in the artist some great 
emotion? We shall hazard no answer. (3) In observing the daily 
life of a great many individuals, we seem to see the following 
factors at work: One individual has reached a low level of adjust- 
ment; he can typewrite so many words a minute, or telegraph so 
many words a minute, or make so many entries in his journal: if 
this low level of adjustment gives the individual his daily bread, 
he does not depart from it. His social relations at home and 
on the outside are on the same dead level. His emotional atti-
-P-A-G-E-262
248 PSYCHOLOGY 
tudes are stereotyped. One takes the attitude of suffering at 
everything ; another the religious attitude; still another the hard- 
done-by, and the downtrodden attitude. There seems to be a wall 
around these people. Is there no way of breaking through this 
wall and getting the individual to reach a higher level of achieve- 
ment? Emotionally exciting stimuli occasionally seem to accom- 
plish it. The sudden accession of responsibility or wealth; the 
enforced demands which come with marriage and the rearing 
of a family; sometimes even a strong rage or fear, may preak 
through the stereotyped and habitual mode of response, and 
arouse the individual to the point where he can accept and profit 
by intensive training (acquisition of greater gicill in his field) and 
eliminate his errors, work longer hours, and plan his work in a 
more systematic manner.

tion. —At the present time as never before, individuals repre- 
senting authority or control over developing human beings are 
striving to find out enough about the normality and abnormality 
of emotional life to be of help in shaping that phase of the char- 
acter of those under them. By individuals representing author- 
ity we mean explicitly the parent, the physician, the teacher 
and the employer. 
Before attempting to be of help to others in the control of 
emotional reactions and attitudes, it would seem to be the 
most logical procedure to examine for a time one’s own emo- 
tional equipment. The simplest way for the student just begin- 
ning psychology to approach this problem is for him to make a 
study of his own emotional reactions. All the student is asked 
to do here is to note his own activities from moment to moment. 
He should begin to keep a diary of his day: What stimuli most 
usually call out emotional activities; do these activities show the 
more infantile type of phenomena that we see in fear, rage and 
love, or is there only a change in level? What are the immediate 
and the more remote effects upon efficiency and learning? Natu- 
rally, we should include here as a part of his total activity think- 
ing, planning, since these processes show the functioning of lan- 
guage organization. He should determine whether the number of
-P-A-G-E-263
    
HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: EMOTIONS 249 
emotional rises are increasing in number, whether they are 
becoming more stereotyped and consolidated into attitudes, or 
whether they are decreasing as he becomes better balanced and 
adjusted. After such a study the student should come out with 
a much better estimate of his own character than he now has. 
Very few of us have faced ourselves (indexed our own reactions) 
in this way during the formative period of life, and we realize 
often too late that certain overemphasized attitudes have made 
life’s adjustments very difficult for us. Some of the more serious 
defects in emotional adjustment (especially those connected with 
the sex life) will escape the student’s own observation. Because 
of this it is extremely worth-while to have another person make 
systematic observations upon you, which must extend over some 
period of time. Our measure of normality or balance is not a 
mathematical or quantitative one, but a common-sense one. 
From such studies we arrive at the conclusions: (1) that there 
is normal emotional adjustment; (2) that the majority of indi- 
viduals are not perfectly balanced, but their weaknesses are so 
compensated for by other factors (habit) that it is safe to pre- 
dict that no break-down will occur unless the crisis is very un- 
usual or severe; (3) there are emotionally unstable individuals. 
So many wrong attachments and detachments have been made, 
so many unsafe outlets have been formed, so high or so low is 
the level of activity, so persistently do these levels appear and 
so easily are they provoked, that we cannot fail to conclude that 
the person exhibiting them is in need of medical attention—the 
advice of modern psychiatrist should be sought. The parent, 
the teacher and the employer are, however, brought face to face 
constantly with individuals belonging in this last class under con- 
ditions where it is not possible to obtain the advice of a properly 
trained psychiatrist. Some kind of practical safe and sane way of 
controlling these factors must be sought. After the unstable in- 
dividual has been studied and the main factors connected with 
his lack of balance have been found out, there are two ways of 
possibly doing good without introducing the element of harm: 
(1) the environment may be altered; (2) the individual may 
be retrained. ; )
-P-A-G-E-264
  250 PSYCHOLOGY 
Summary of Practical Aspects of Emotion.—Sometimes the 
conditions antecedent to emotional disturbance are quite simple 
when discovered. (1) There may be ordinary factors, such as 
wrong diet, overindulgence in certain foods, overeating, lack of 
regularity in sleep and insufficient sleep. It is assumed, of course, 
that the individual has been in the hands of a physician and that 
organic disturbances and deficiencies have been corrected as far 
as possible (including hyper- and hypo-activity of the glands of 
internal secretion). A change of routine often succeeds in bring- 
ing about the disappearance of the mal-adjustment. (2) In 
children especially there are factors of a very different character 
which can produce disturbances. The parents by giving way to 
the child, noting its every pain and woe, doing things for it which 
it should do for itself, failing to force it to form the early habits 
every child should put on (thereby putting it out of adjustment 
with its mates) ; now railing at the child and scolding it, the 
next moment displaying entirely too violent an attachment for 
it—this condition soon breeds a series of attitudes (dependence, 
inferiority, rage, depressions) ; which many times cannot be cor- 
rected until the child is removed from that environment. (3) As 
the child grows older, a still more complicated set of causal fac- 
tors comes in. It is called upon to react to a world of situations 
connected with sex. They are made peculiarly sensitive to such 
situations by their own developing bodies. The stimuli from 
without are hurled at them in such conflicting ways that proper 
associations have no time to form, and there are no preéxisting 
organized channels for appropriate reaction. Wrong sex theories 
are built up; harmful attachments are made and poor outlets 
are formed. We have in mind here the complex conditions which 
are at hand around the age of puberty. The youths have to face 
a mass of sex stories and wrong conceptions of how children 
come into the world. Sometimes these come from associates of 
their own age, but often from older children who for the younger 
represent authority. Unless these theories are straightened out 
by the parents (or teacher or physician) they get out of touch 
with their environment. Most healthy children pass safely
-P-A-G-E-265

through this period; some, however, do not emerge unscathed. 
Improvement can be obtained in such cases if the parents are 
able to establish a perfect rapport with the child and to talk such 
matters out quite frankly. A true education process is begun. 
Appropriate systems or ways of responding to the sex situation 
are prepared. If the mal-adjustment has gone on for any great 
length of time, it may be necessary to remove the child for a time 
from the persons, places and things around which his poorly 
adjusted reactions cling. (4) One other especially trying period 
occurs when the young man and woman break home attachments 
and ties and leave a sheltered environment to face a world which 
they must build for themselves. They have their occupations to 
choose and master and their mates to select and adjust to. How 
they meet this new world depends very largely upon the emotional 
attitude they bring with them from the childhood and adolescent 
periods. If their repertoire includes the attitude of seclusive- 
ness, suspicion and inferiority, or if the sheltering process has 
gone on too long, healthy adjustments of the type demanded are 
hard to form and actual psychoses may ensue. A process of re- 
training must take place. The factors involved in retraining 
belong in the chapter devoted to habit. }

  CHAPTER VII ‘ 
UNLEARNED BEHAVIOR: ‘‘ INSTINCT ”’ 
Introduction.—In our discussion of emotion we brought out 
the fact that there is no‘sharp line of separation between emo- 
tion and instinct. ‘Shia are hereditary modes of action.) On 
page 194 we stated that in emotion the radius of action lies within 
the individual’s organism, whereas in instinct the radius of action 
is extended in such a way that the individual as a whole may 
make adjustments to objects in his environment. While the 
radius of action in instinct is extended, the action at the same time 
is particularized—narrowed down to some specific form of adjust- 
ment, ¢.g., nursing, wiping off an offending substance, grasping 
, the covers or any small object with the hands, ete. If the above 
distinction could be made to apply wholly without exception it 
would be equivalent to saying that in emotion the action is im- 
plicit mass action, whereas in instinct it is explictt definitized and 
localized action. But in the previous chapter we found that while 
the reaction in emotion involved mainly a general response in the 
visceral motor and glandular side of the organism (implicit), 
movements of the striped musculature (explicit) were involved 
to some extent. Notwithstanding this exception, the distinction 
suggested above is serviceable. We can hardly escape the fact 
that in emotion the implicit factors predominate. We shall see 
from our present study that in instinct the action is explicit and 
capable of being observed in general without instrumentation. 
Probably every stimulus which leads to a definite instinctive act 
leads at the same time to some change in emotional tension. It 
seems easier to believe that emotion can occur without overt 
instinctive response than that instinctive action can occur without 
at the same time arousing emotional activity. 
Definition of Instinct.~We should define instinct as an hered- 
itary pattern reaction, the separate.elements.of which are move- 
ments principally of thé striped muscles.) It’might otherwise be 
expressed as a combination of explicit congenital responses un- 
252
-P-A-G-E-267
HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: INSTINCT 253 
folding serially under appropriate stimulation. The following 
is an illustration: At a fairly early age, the child will respond 
to a rapid threatening movement of the hand or some other object 
as follows: A definite sharp blink of the eyes (which does not 
appear until about the 100th day), an upward movement of the 
hands and a backward movement of the head. In every instinct 
of the more complicated type, we see that the human animal 
does the same thing, makes some kind of an adjustment. The 
fact accomplished (what he does) may or may not be adaptive. 
Many of the hereditary acts are, of course, adaptive, but many 
of them are non-adaptive and even anti-adaptive. William James 
has made some statements about instinct which are as nearly 
true now as when he wrote them: 
“The actions we call instinctive all conform to the general 
reflex type; they are-called forth by determinate sensory stimuli 
am contact with the animal’s body or at a distance in his environ- 
ment.’’ And again: ‘‘The older writings on instinct are inef- 
fectual waste of words, because their authors never came down 
to this definite and simple point of view, but smothered every- 
thing*in vague wonder at the clairvoyant and prophetic power 
of the animals—so superior to anything in man—and at the ben- 
eficence of God in endowing them with such a gift. But God’s 
beneficence endows them, first of all, with a nervous system; and 
turning our attention to this makes instinct appear neither more 
nor less wonderful than all the other facts of life.’ 
The simplest way for those beginning the study of instinct 
is to look, upon every definite act that the infant performs at 
an early age, and hence without learning, as an instinet. If the 
pure instinctive activities are to be isolated we must here also 
adopt the genetic method. In advance it may be said that if we 
look upon all untutored activity of the child as instinctive, we 
shall have to admit that man has a large repertoire of instincts, 
but we shall see that they are not all of the full-fledged pattern 
type. We do not see the very young infant fighting, running, swim- 
ming and burrowing, but we do find him performing a goodly 
number of less spectacular acts, some of which we shall soon 
describe. At a later age we do find the youth running, fighting, 
swimming and doing many other things that the animals do. We 
   
-P-A-G-E-268
  254. PSYCHOLOGY 
* are not at this age dealing with pure instincts, however, but with 
instinct plus habit. The question is pertinent. as to why we wish 
to make distinctions among the instinct, habit and emotional 
activities. The answer here as it was in the case of emotions is 
that such an abstraction is necessary if we are ever to be in a 
position where we can understand and use instinctive factors 
to the fullest extent. We shall by no means neglect the instinct- 
habit consolidation. We shall take up in detail such consolida- 
tions and show that they function very much as do ‘‘pure’’ 
instincts. 
The Distinction Between Reflex and Instinct.—The term 
reflex is a convenient abstraction in both physiology and be- 
havior. In clinical neurology we speak of testing a patient’s 
reflexes such as the patellar, the movement of the pupil under the 
action of light, the adjustment of the lens, the plantar, ete. In 
physiology we speak of the reflexes connected with circulation, 
respiration, digestion, ete. We mean by reflex when used in this 
way that action takes place under appropriate stimulation in 
some fairly circumscribed glandular or muscular tissud.- It is an 
abstraction because reflex action in the eye, the leg, hand or foot 
can never take place in isolation. Action is altered in other parts 
of the body as well. We brought some of these factors out in our 
discussion of the knee jerk. The clinician and the physiologist, 
however, are not interested for the moment in action in any part 
of the body other than in the particular motor organ which is 
under observation. Our schematic drawing on page 118 showed 
the fewest neural connections necessary for a reflex, but action of 
such simplicity never really takes place. (ie term reflex, how- 
ever, is an extremely convenient one and by it we mean the sim- 
plest type of activity that can ordinarily be produced. ) Theo- 
retically we might have a pure reflex if we were to stimulate a 
single neuro-fibrillar ending of an afferent neurone and had a 
single neuro-fibrillar strand of a motor neurone connected with a 
single muscle fiber. This dissection has never been made nor has 
any one been interested in making it. We defined instinct aboy:

HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: INSTINCT 257 
trolled conditions. This study must be looked upon merely as the 
beginning of the general survey suggested above. 
Tue Genetic Stupy or Instincts 
Early Sensory Responses.—A large number of observations 
have been collected in our laboratory upon the early sensory re- 
sponses of infants. If the infant’s breathing and hand move- 
ment are being recorded during sensory stimulation, evidences 
of sensitivity can be obtained. From birth the infant responds 
to loud noises, to the tearing of paper and to the scraping 
of one object upon another (Fig. 55, A). The responses have 
been partially considered under the emotion of fear—the catching 
of the breath, spasmodic movements of arms and legs and the 
closing of the hand are the responses to be observed. Sensitivity 
to tuning forks and other musical instruments is not marked. 
Unless placed very close to the ear or made very loud, no re- “ 
sponse can be obtained. Similar undifferentiated responses have 
been obtained by stimulating with different olfactory substances, 
such as oil of peppermint, asafcetida, butyric acid and ammonia 
(Fig. 55, C). Most of the responses were obtained from sub- 
stances which stimulate the fifth nerve, which is a tactual nerve. 
No very sure results have been obtained from the milder per- 
fumes. Pinching, sticking with a pin, warm and cold objects, 
twisting and turning of a joint (contact and kinesthetic), all will 
produce changes in respiration and in the rate, amplitude and 
form of the movement curve obtained from the hands. Vision so 
far has been tested only with respect to the infant’s ability to 
fixate a white light (page 264). This occurs at birth. Color 
sensitivity has not been tested. It can be determined, but only 
with difficulty. 
The First Thirty Days of Childhood.—Infants often sneeze 
immediately upon being taken from the mother. Hiccoughing 
may begin after the first few hours. Yawning has been noted 
five minutes after birth. Crying is also one of the earliest re- 
sponses. The birth ery occurs at the moment the respiratory 
centers are stimulated after birth. In some eases it is necessary 
to stimulate the infant with hot and cold plunges in order to start

The second was the word “1300” said loudly. B is a graphic record of the left and right wrist and arm movements during “‘free”’ activity. C is the reaction of the right and left wrist and 
arm movements to two faint ammonia stimulations. (Infant less than one day of age.)

   HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: INSTINCT 259 
breathing. The cry often comes an instant after the infant 
touches the water. The mechanisms involved in the erection of the 
penis, voiding of wrine and defecation are functional at birth or 
very shortly thereafter. Tears apparently are shed within the 
first few hours after birth. Children, however, often fail to shed 
tears until several days after birth. Some dates are as follows: 
S showed dampness in corners of eyes after crying on the 13th 
day ; L on the 15th, crying with a copious flow of tears on the 34th 
day. Smiles are rare at an early age. Under observation some 
first dates are as follows: S, 4 days; O’K, 7 days; K, 8 days; C 
smiled: repeatedly on the 28th day. Tickling under the chin and 
stroking other parts of the body will occasionally bring out a 
smile. Children at an early age can turn the head when placed 
face down on a pillow. C, 30 minutes old, rotated her head in 
such a way as to leave her mouth and nose free. Several other 
infants did equally well at 114 hours of age. Raising the head 
may occur at any time after birth. These head movements appear 
most clearly if the infant is supported by placing the open hand 
under the stomach and supporting its back with the other hand. 
In observed eases subjects ranging from 2 to 15 days could sup- 
port their heads for times varying from one to six seconds. Hand 
movements: Spreading of the fingers and closing of the hands 
occur at any time after ‘birth. Repeated movements of many 
kinds are made with legs, feet and toes. It is often asserted that 
babies can cling with their toes, but this has not been observed. 
Kicking with the legs and slashing with the arms are almost con- 
tinuous during active moments from a few minutes after birth. 
Turning over: Subject T at 7 days turned repeatedly from face to 
back when not impeded by clothing. Stretching: Begins very 
early in life and varies from a mere raising of the arm to a com- 
plete stretching of the legs and toes, arching of the back and ab- 
en, ete. (Summarized from Mrs. Blanton’s study). 
Some Instincts Singled Out for Study—(1) Nursing. Te y 
either cheek or the chin is touched lightly with the finger, an 
infant shortly after birth will move the head in such a way as to 
bring the mouth in contact with the finger. In deep sleep it 
apparently disappears. After feeding it is also very hard to elicit, 
     
-P-A-G-E-272
    
260 PSYCHOLOGY 
During hunger it is very easy to elicit, the infant often moving 
with such surprising quickness that it catches the finger in its 
mouth. Again, if one taps lightly above or below the corner of 
the mouth of a sleeping baby the lips are pursed into a nursing 
position ; occasionally the tongue will protrude and complete suck-

seem to be able to get the fingers and hands into the mouth. The 
sucking instinct as a whole seems to be well codrdinated by the 
end of the first half-hour. The series of reflexes as a whole is 
made up of tongue, lip and cheek movements, swallowing being 
the final link in the chain of activities. Although the evidence is 
not complete as yet, failure in the ability to swallow is suggestive

of retardation. Children born of defective parents seem to have 
difficulty with swallowing. 
(2) Grasping reflex. Records of tests on approximately one 
hundred babies in Baltimore ranging in age from birth to 150 
days show that the grasping reflex is present in practically ail 
normal cases. There have been only three or four exceptions 
found. The method of testing the babies is shown in Fig. 56, D. 
Not all babies will support the full weight. Most of them, how- 
ever, will support the full body weight for a longer or a shorter 
time and with either hand. The results for the first twenty days 
of infancy are shown in Fig. 57. Our records from the twentieth 
day onward are not yet complete, but samplings show that the 
reflex is present in more or less perfect form up to about the 
120th day or longer. It seems to give way about the time the eye- 
hand codrdination is formed. This habit is discussed on page 296. 
In abnormal cases, rickets, mal-nutrition generally, oversupply 
of fat, illness, ete., the reflex is apparently lacking. In one baby 
born without a cerebrum the reflex was practically perfect up to 
the day of its death at 18 days. 
v (8) Right- and left-handedness. This method opens up the 
problem of testing whether handedness is an instinct or a socially 
acquired habit. Those babies which will support their full weight 
on any given day will cling for a longer or a shorter time with 
either the right or the left hand. A wide series of records has 
been kept and a large number of babies has been followed through 
day by day, but the application of statistical method shows that 
there is not any steady predominance in either right or left hand 
in the length of suspension. The problem of handedness has also 
been attacked in another way. The baby is laid flat on its back; 
its hands are attached by means of a linen thread to two pivoted 
writing levers in practically frictionless bearings. No matter 
whether the infant moves its hand down or up, to the right or to 
the left, or to any intermediate position, a vertical tracing is 
recorded upon a smoked drum. Fig. 56, B, shows such a trac- 
ing. It was hoped by this method to obtain a constantly greater 
ev less amount of activity with either the one or the other hand 
in a given period of time. In making the test both the random 
wo
-P-A-G-E-275
  
HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: INSTINCT 263 
activity (intra-organically aroused) and activity extra-organi- 
cally aroused by midline contact stimulation were recorded. The 
method has not as yet yielded any very decisive results. Although 
the child is stripped it is almost impossible to keep it lying in 
such a way that the one or the other hand is not given more or 
less freedom. Still another method for determining handedness 
has been tried, namely, the anthropometric one of measuring the 
diameter of the right and left biceps, the length of the left and 
right forearms from the elbow to the second joint of the middle 
fingers. The preliminary report of this method shows that the 
right biceps is larger and the length of the right forearm is 
slightly greater than the left. These results probably cannot be 
trusted. We are thus left without conclusions as to the problem 
of handedness. In early infancy there is certainly no preferen- 
tial use. The early habit codrdinations, too, seem to form about 
as readily with the left as with the right hand, and yet we know 
that so far as adult activity is concerned, about 96 per cent. of 
individuals are right-handed. 
(4) Defense movements. Barly defense movements have been 
rather thoroughly tried out in a large number of infants, but by 
a very crude method. The nose is lightly pinched and the length 
of time it takes the child to touch the experimenter’s fingers is 
recorded. A few sample records are given: 
B. 4 days. Hands went up at once, and pushed at experi- 
menter’s fingers in three seconds. 
HT. 12 days. Movement started rapidly. Struck experi- 
menter’s fingers in three seconds. 
BE. 3 days. Right hand struck experimenter’s fingers in 18 
seconds on the first trial, 2 seconds on the second trial. 
T. 8 days. Struck experimenter’s fingers with the right hand 
in 3 seconds and with the left in 4 seconds. On the next trial, 
struck first with the left hand in 5 seconds, with the right in 6. 
Another interesting defense movement may be noted as fol- 
lows: If the baby lies on its back with legs extended and the 
inner surface of one knee is lightly pinched, the opposite foot is 
brought up almost with the regularity seen in the reflex frog. 
(Fig. 56, A, shows the reflex.) 
     
-P-A-G-E-276
  264 PSYCHOLOGY 
T. 8 days. Left knee pinched. Right heel struck experi- 
menter’s fingers in 3/5 second. Right knee pinched. Left heei 
struck experimenter’s fingers in 20 seconds. Several abortive 
attempts were made. 
M. Wess than one day. Pinched left knee. Right foot struck 
in 35 seconds. Pinched right knee. Left foot struck in 48 
seconds. 
H. 5 days. Pinched left knee. Right foot failed to reach ex- 
perimenter’s fingers. When right knee was pinched, the left 
foot struck in 10 seconds. 
These are only samples of a very large number of records. 
The records as a whole run closely similar to these samples. It 
will be noticed that we have here an interesting opportunity to 
study rapidity of habit formations in even the one-day-old infant. 
Such experiments have not yet been conducted. The pinching is 
never made severe enough to produce any mark and there is not 
the slightest injury or danger in making the experiment. In fact, 
it may be made to serve as a very useful exercise at the hands of a 
considerate experimenter. 
(5) Absence of swimming movement. Some speculation has 
been entered into as to whether the new-born infant would show 
codrdinated swimming movements (see recapitulation theory, 
page 287). Some definite experiments have been carried out a 
few minutes after birth. A small galvanized iron tank was filled 
with water to a height of about ten inches and maintained at the 
body temperature in readiness for the test. After breathing was 
established, the infant was lowered slowly into the water and sup- 
ported on the back by the experimenter’s hands. Violent expres- 
sion of fear—a cry, checking of breathing followed by deeper 
inspiration and rapid, entirely uncodrdinated slashing of hands 
and feet were all that could be observed. In making the test the 
greatest care was used not to let the baby’s head sink so low as to 
allow water to enter the nose or mouth. The infant’s behavior is 
in marked contrast to that observed in certain other young mam- 
mals, some of which swim moderately well the first time they are 
placed in the water. 
‘ (6) Orientation to Light—The following experiment was
-P-A-G-E-277
  
  HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: INSTINCT 265 
made on approximately 20 children at varying ages from 
birth to several days of age: the child was laid flat on its back 
and its head held horizontally by means of two cotton-wool 
pads. Immediately above the head was fastened a perimeter, 
the radius of which was one-half meter. A small carriage bearing 
a light could be made to travel from one portion of the perimeter 
to another. The position of the light immediately above the 
baby’s eyes was called the zero position. From that position the 
light could be carried to any desired number of degrees to the 
right or to the left. The tests were, of course, carried out in the 
dark room. The light was just bright enough for the dark-adapted 
observers’ eyes to note whether or not orientation occurred. Two 
observers had to agree that it had occurred. A few sample records 
only are offered. The times given represent the interval from 
the moment the light was exposed until orientation occurred : 
Infant B, 141% hours old: 
10 degrees to the left, 15 seconds; 
10 degrees to the right, 10 seconds; 
15 degrees to the right, 12 seconds; 
15 degrees to the left, 6 seconds; 
25 degrees to the left, failed in two trials; 
25 degrees to the right, failed. 
In the last two cases, of course, the extent of the eye movement 
demanded is so great that it was not expected that the child 
could attain it. j 
Infant C, 17 hours old: 
10 degrees to the right, 15 seconds; 
10 degrees to the left, 13 seconds; 
20 degrees to the left, cried and closed eyes in two trials; 
20 degrees to the left, 30 seconds (after a slight rest 
] in the light) ; 
10 degrees to the left, 5 seconds; 
20 degrees to the right, 12 seconds; the right eye turned 
perfectly, but the left did not seem to follow 
synchronously. 
Similar tests were carried out with perimeter swung so that 
the object would appear in the upper and lower meridians. Natu- 
rally the infants do not make these movements so well. 
    
-P-A-G-E-278
  266 PSYCHOLOGY 
Definite orientation was not found in every trial, but in a 
group’ of. twenty or more infants selected at random, one infant 
17 hours of age, and one other that never could be kept awake 
long enough to make the tests failed to give positive results. In 
many cases the infants would go so fast asleep that the tests on 
“any given day would have to be abandoned. 
‘We thus see that the child at birth has at least a well de- 
veloped. mechanism for turning the eyes toward the lighted half 
of the visual field. That true fixation occurs is not maintained. 
That we are dealing here with a native mechanism is probable, 
since the infants had had little opportunity in their darkened 
room to form. visual habits. The true fixation of people’s faces 
and definite objects in.a well-lighted room occurs at a much later 
date; at just what date has not been determined upon any large 
number of children. 
(7) Blinking —Blinking, which may be considered a part of 
the general avoiding movements, and which in older children 
and adults is followed by the backward throw of the head and 
preparatory movements for stepping backward, is not present at 
birth. A number of children have been consistently tested for 
the purpose of determining its incidence. Some random examples 
*~ are given here: 
S. 174 days, perfect. 
W. 72 days, absent. 
Y. 47 days, absent. 
B. 55 days, absent. 
Y. 75 days, slightly present. 
B. 83 days, present on half of the tests. 
F, 124 days, present. 
Lee, one of the youngsters most carefully tested, blinked 
twice on the 87th day; would not blink on the 127th day; on the 
129th day blinked on the first two stimulations, but failed on the 
next four. On the 136th day, blinked at every stimulation, eight 
times. Thus, in her case, blinking was not firmly established until 
the 136th day. 
The earliest the reflex has been noted is at 55 days. It seems 
to vary as a rule between 75 and 120 days, although this has not 
been very accurately determined. There seems to be, too, a de- 
veloping or ripening period. 
v (8) The Babinski Refler—The Babinski has been tried out

    HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: INSTINCT 267 
several hundred times, but at present we are not prepared to 
give any detailed report of the life history of this reflex. At 
birth and for some months thereafter if the sole of the foot of 
the infant is stroked with the blunt end of a match (Fig. 56 B), 
the great toe shows extension, whereas the small toes ‘‘fan’’ or 
else show flexion as in the adult. The total result is shown in Fig. 
56, C. The reflex is connected by physicians with lack of medul- 
lation in the pyramidal tract. It is assumed that as soon as 
medullation is complete in the tract the reflex disappears. As a 
whole the pattern of the reflex is a very variable one. 
(9) Crawling —Whether crawling is an inherited pattern re- 
action is, we should say, somewhat doubtful. Our results again 
are not as yet secure. If an infant from birth is put down upon 
a thin mat fastened tightly to a table top, it will at the end of 
ten minutes have slightly changed its position. Very shortly 
after birth a regression of as much as four inches has been no- 
ticed. Long before anything like the codrdinated movements of 
legs and arms that are so necessary in the complete set of crawl- 
ing movements occur, slashing movements of legs or arms or 
of both will throw the infant’s trunk to the right or to the left. 
Systematic tests were begun upon L at 87 days of age. The 
method in general was as follows: A single cotton blanket was 
stretched tightly to a table top. A small piece of wood was then 
pushed up against the feet. In a minute or two she had pushed 
this away as far as the toes would reach. This position was then 
marked. <A piece of candy was put in front of her face. On the 
87th day, ‘‘climbing’’ movements with the legs were fairly well 
codrdinated. The right leg would struggle forward and then the 
left; then one or both would be kicked out. The hand and arm 
» movement showed no codrdination. No advance was shown up to 
the 115th day. Definite progress was noted on that day in the 
use of the arms. There was some slight use of the elbows. The 
fore part of the body was considerably raised. From the 87th 
day on, the head was well raised for the first two or three min- 
utes. It would gradually sink down. On the 115th day, she made 
a forward progress of two inches in nine minutes. Circus mo- 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
  268 PSYCHOLOGY 
tions were present, and the body would be rocked from side to 
side. This rocking movement seemed to net the gain rather than 
the progressive movements of the legs and arms. On this date 
for the first time, she grasped the blanket ahead of her and 
apparently pulled herself slightly forward. Even on the 220th 
day crawling was not much further advanced, although she had 
been tested every week from the 87th day. At that time the 
experiment had to be discontinued. (The mother reports that 
one week after the above date this baby began to crawl, and during 
that week she learned to pull herself up by holding on to objects.) 
Subject NV at the end of 163 days had made little more progress. 
T, a fine, well-developed baby, at 182 days had not learned to 
crawl, although on that date she had learned to stand alone, 
supporting herself on the bars of the crib after her mother had 
helped her up. F, another well-developed baby, up to 131 days 
had not made the slightest effort to crawl. When placed upon 
the mat he would usually lie still with head resting on the table 
and with the left cheek down. Feet and arms were sprawled out. 
M, the son of one of the instructors, was watched very carefully 
for the first ten months of his life. On the 280th day, the infant 
took hold of a side of its bassinet and raised itself to its feet 
for the first time. This he practiced incessantly for a week, 
standing for as long a time as he could, then sitting down to rest 
and then repeating the process. This general method of reach- 
ing out for an object, pulling himself up to it if it were fixed, 
standing up, sitting down, reaching out again, gave him a method 
of locomotion, but he did not crawl in the ordinary sense. When 
placed on the floor in; the crawling position on the 284th day, 
he began! to twist and turn, to sit up and roll over, and to go 
through any movement which would produce locomotion except 
crawling. Crawling in this child was never an instinctive process. 
Two other children of my colleagues never crawled in the ordi- 
nary sense of that term. M had a system all her own. Loco- 
motion was effected practically by the use of her left arm, which 
she very speedily learned to use without making circus move- 
ments. This endured up to the walking period at 380 days. J 
adopted a most curious and unusual method of locomotion. He
-P-A-G-E-281
  HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: INSTINCT 269 
would sit up, put his hands forward on the floor and slightly 
‘raise and slide his body along. He would come to a rest and 
again reach out his hands and repeat the process. He became 
very adept in this, moving at no mean speed. His suecess prob- 
ably delayed his walking, which did not take place until he was 
510 days of age. Even after learning to walk, when he was in 
a hurry he would resort to the more primitive method of loco- 
motion. While we do not affirm that crawling may not have a 
definite time of appearance and that it is not a definite instinc- 
tive pattern in some cases, we are prepared to affirm that it is 
not anything like as prevalent an instinct as is commonly sup- 
posed. Walking has not yet been brought under observation in 
our laboratory. 
(10) Positive and Negative Reaction Tendencies—The 
method of making tests on this very important subject is to estab- 
lish first the eye-hand codrdination. This is done usually by 
means of a stick of old-fashioned red striped peppermint candy. 
When this was established perfectly, the infant was offered a 
series of objects to which it had not reacted before. Some test 
cases are given: LZ completed eye-hand codrdination at about the 
129th day. She reached for stop watch, dark ink eraser (136 
days), pipette with red bulb and for candle (150-days). The re- 
action to the candle was most pronounced. She held out both 
hands for it and reached out as far from her mother’s lap as 
was possible. She was tested with a round metal ball and reached 
for it immediately. Attention has already been called to the fact 
that this child reacted positively to small animals. On the 169th 
day, she was tested for the presence of the washing or wiping reac- 
tion (so-called instinct of cleanliness). We first rolled up a ball of 
library paste, making it just as sticky as possible. After it had 
been warmed in the experimenter’s hands it was offered to her 
on a piece of paper. She took hold of the edge of the paper 
with both hands, but did not roll the paste down to her hand. 
The paste was then held out to her between the experimenter’s 
fingers. She caught it at once with both hands and carried it 
to her mouth. She was checked and her hands were washed. 
She repeated the reaction on the next trial. On the third trial
-P-A-G-E-282
  270 PSYCHOLOGY 
she manipulated it with her fingers, fixating the process with 
her eyes very continually. She did not attempt to put it into 
her mouth. With one piece in her right hand, she reached out 
for an additional piece with her left hand. There was not the 
slightest tendency to wipe off her fingers and hands. A cake 
of wet soap was next offered her. She reached for it with both 
hands. She rubbed her fingers up and down on it and tried hard 
to grasp its slippery surface. She reached her head forward 
and downward and tried to get her mouth to the soap. She 
tried hard to grasp it first with the right hand, then with both 
hands, and made peevish, querulous sounds when she failed to 
get hold of it. There was not the slightest avoiding tendency, or 
wiping or washing tendency; present. A large bunch of cotton 
wool was held out to her. She reached for it first with the left 
hand and then with the right, smiling as she stroked it. She 
reached for it repeatedly. A smooth thick piece of glass, a lens 
without mounting, was held out to her. Her reactions to it were 
much like those made to the soap. Positive reaction tendencies 
were observed to an electric light bulb and to many other small 
objects. She played with a bunch of violin bow hairs in much 
the same way that she had played with the cotton wool. In her 
case at the ages studied, it will be seen that practically no avoid- 
ing tendencies were instinctive. “We can summarize as is gen- 
erally done and say that once the reaching codrdination has been 
formed, infants respond positively to nearly all small objects 
which are given a high stimulating value by moving them. 
No definite avoiding tendencies have been noted at this age, 
except those mentioned under blinking and defense reactions. 
These tests have been repeated upon two other children of ap- 
proximately the same age who had never previously been stimu- 
lated by such objects. The whole series of tests would be pointless 
if habit formation had been present with respect to these objects. 
Theory of Positive and Negative Reaction Tendencies.— 
Although we are not prepared to insist upon it we are inclined 
to believe that man is originally endowed with various kinds of 
positive reaction tendencies, but with few negative reaction ten- 
dencies. The few negative tendencies are to be seen in the ‘‘avoid-
-P-A-G-E-283
  HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: INSTINCT 271 
ance’’ of loud-sounding objects, the struggle to escape from those 
which excite rage and fear generally, and the guarding or fend- 
ing movements used in connection with any object or person that 
tends to injure the subject’s own tissue. In addition there are 
many objects which are not reacted to at all, or reacted to only 
with the eye, for, example, such as objects too far away to reach, 
ete. Taken as a whole, however, the child reacts positively to 
hundreds of objects where it reacts to one in a negative way. 
Negative reaction tendencies (with exceptions noted) as we see 
them are the products of training such as we see in conditioned 
reflexes or training of the most highly integrated and associated 
types. 
We are inclined to think that as the individual grows older 
persons, places and things tend to become generally associated 
\ with organic responses of one kind or another and to some extent 
specifically with those connected with love (page 221). The 
individual cannot usually put the connection in words; he cannot 
state, for example, why he reacts positively to this person or 
thing but negatively to that person or thing. We might state 
the general theory of positive and negative reactions very much 
as we stated it in 1914. Every object either by virtue of the 
original constitution of the individual or through associative 
connections of one kind or another (conditioned reflex or habit) 
calls out, in addition to the ordinary overt or delayed response 
in the striped musculature, a definite and complex group of 
reflex activity in the erogenous zones. When thus stimulated this 
area may according to the way in which it has been excited 
arouse two fundamental kinds of impulses, (1) a group connected 
with tumescence, rhythmical contractions of other muscular tis- 
sue, and with increases in the quantity of the various secretions. 
This group, if functioning alone, would lead to the positive seek- 
ing movements, and ultimately to the unfolding of the instinctive 
mechanism of the act of reproduction. (2) A group connected 
with detumescence inhibition and relaxation of other muscular 
tissue and with inhibition of secretions. These impulses gaining 
the motor centers would, if no inhibitory factors were present, 
release the movements of avoidance. In order to make this matter 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  272 PSYCHOLOGY 
definite, let us turn to animal psychology and take the neuro- 
physiological situation at the moment of sex excitement. 
When a definite sex object (female) appeals to any distance 
receptor, the eye or the ear of the male (granting a certain 
physiological condition of the animal, 7.e., the proper season 
of the year, period of sex excitement, ete., in general; since 
seasonal rhythms are not so marked in the male, the animal 
must be in a receptive condition for such stimuli), at least two 
sets of arcs begin to function: (a) one leading from the distance 
receptor (aroused by the sex object) to the striped muscles, tend- 
ing to produce a heightened tone in the skeletal muscles; (b) the 
other, leading likewise from the distance receptor, passes out 
(via the white rami) to the appropriate sympathetic ganglia. 
When these neurones are stimulated changes are produced in the 
circulatory, glandular, secretory and muscular mechanisms, pos- 
sibly of the character described in (1) above. As soon as these 
effectors are thrown into activity, they set up a characteristic 
_ group of afferent impulses which upon reaching the motor centers 
complete the initiation of overt-seeking movements. When the 
situation is prolonged and contact receptors become stimulated by 
the result of the seeking movements, the complex sex act follows. 
On the other hand, if the general physiological condition is 
different (organism not receptive to sex stimuli), there again 
arises (a) an increased tonus in the striped muscles and (6) 
activity in the sympathetic mechanisms, but in this case there 
is a checking of secretion, lack of tonicity in the muscles, ete. 
(2 above), which arouse in turn a definite group of afferent 
impulses that tends definitely to set free the avoiding reaction. 
Since the mechanisms involved in sex are fundamental, it seems 
reasonable to suppose that every object, either instinctively or 
through habit, tends to throw them into one or the other form 
of action of which we have just spoken. 
Certainly many objects (non-emotion producing stimuli, 
stimuli distantly or not at all connected with sex) do not in 
the beginning arouse these groups, but through the ordinary 
mechanism of habit and the formation of conditioned reflexes 
come later to arouse faintly or overtly the one or the other, There
-P-A-G-E-285
HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: INSTINCT 273 
is evidence in sexual pathology to show not only that such habit 
connections are formed, but also that they can become more funda- 
mental than the primal instinctive pathways, as is shown in the 
use of phallic symbols, fetishes, ete. 
This theory has been objected to on the ground that it seems 
unduly to emphasize the instinctive factors connected with love. 
It in a way maintains that action is determined and evaluated 
by such factors. But our use of the term love here is entirely 
different from that ordinarily employed. We use the term in the 
modern way in which it is used in psycho-pathology. Nearly 
every one will admit that there are such factors at the bottom of 
home life, in our general social life and even in our vocations. 
We work long hours, try to improve our position and bring in 
more money, in order that our home life may be carried out upon 
a broader scale. The activities centered around loved objects 
and persons from infancy to old age are easily the most im- 
portant factors in our life as a whole. It is no wonder that our 
acts should be connected with and evaluated by such a refer- 
ence as we have indicated (the connections lying usually below 
the language level). 
The Order of Appearance of Various Instincts——While the 
field of animal instincts has been worked over with a good deal 
of care with respect. to the time of appearance, time of disap- 
pearance, and the, cyclical character of inherited activities, no 
one has as yet made a similarly careful study of the temporal 
aspects of instincts in man. We have some data upon this subject, 
as was brought out in our genetic study. The principle can at 
least be illustrated, e.g., by the grasping reflex which appears at 
birth, increases in definiteness and disappears, probably gradu- 
ally, at about 120 days; by blinking, which does not appear until 
about the 100th day and which endures for life; and by the final 
group of instincts connected with the sex acts proper (coition), 
which appears at puberty and continues indefinitely. As a rule, 
an instinct shows a waxing or developmental stage which may 
be short or extend over some time. In those instincts which 
die out after a time there is probably a similar waning period. 
The sex instinct illustrates (but none too well) the periodical 
or cyclical character of instincts. It is about the only example 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
  274 PSYCHOLOGY 
of it we find in man if we neglect the periodic functioning of 
the vegetative instincts. We see the cycles in instinct very clearly 
in the animal world in those activities connected with nest build- 
ing, migration, hibernation, ete. 
‘When the instinct-habit consolidations, discussed on page 238, 
are considered, some interesting pedagogical and moral conclu- 
sions are often drawn. William James has expressed this idea 
in his own inimitable way in connection with the discussion of 
the transitoriness of instincts: 
Leaving lower animals aside, and turning to human instincts, 
we see the law of transiency corroborated on the widest scale by 
the alternation of different interests and passions as human life 
goes on. With the child, life is all play and fairy-tales and 
learning the external properties of ‘‘things’’; with the youth, it 
is bodily exercise of a more systematic sort, novels of the real 
world, boon-fellowship and song, nature, travel and adventure, 
science and philosophy; with the man, ambition and policy, ac- 
quisitiveness, responsibility to others, and the selfish zest of the 
battle of life. If a boy grows up alone at the age of games and 
sports, and learns neither to play ball, nor row, nor sail, nor ride, 
nor skate, nor fish, nor shoot, probably he will be sedentary to the 
end of his days; and, though the best of opportunities be afforded 
him for learning these things later, it is a hundred to one but he 
will pass them by and shrink back from the effort of taking those 
necessary first steps the prospect of which, at an earlier age, 
would have filled him with eager delight. The sexual passion 
expires after a protracted reign; but it is well known that its 
peculiar manifestations in a given individual depend almost 
entirely upon the habits he may form during the early period 
of its activity. Exposure to bad company then makes him a loose 
liver all his days; chastity kept at first makes the same easier 
later on. In all pedagogy the great thing is to strike the iron 
while hot, and to seize the wave of the pupil’s interest in each 
successive subject before its ebb has come, so that knowledge. may 
- be got and a habit of skill acquired—a headway of interest, in 
short, secured, on which afterward the individual may float. 
There is a happy moment for fixing skill in drawing, for making 
boys collectors in natural history, and presently dissectors and 
botanists; then for initiating them into the harmonies of mechan- 
ies and the wonders of physical and chemical law. 
We are far from agreeing with James that in the above 
description he is dealing with Ninstinct as such. He is rather
-P-A-G-E-287
HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: INSTINCT 275 
describing the changing situations that confront the develop- 
ing youth, the onset and course of habit, the effect of social and 
economic pressure, ete., than the transitoriness of instinct. 
Lack of Pattern Instincts in Man.—No fair-minded scientific 
observer of instincts in man should claim that the genus homo 
possesses anything like the picturesque instinctive repertoire 
of the animal. (vet even James maintains the contrary. o we 
neglect the vegetative (including the sex act proper here) and 
the direct life conserving functions, such as attack and defense, 
there are few complete and perfect instincts in man yet observed. 
Instinct and the capacity to form habits, while related functions, 
are present in any animal in inverse ratio. Man excels in his 
habit-forming capacities. So quickly are habits formed upon the 
basis of whatever instinctive activity is present, that man is 
usually accredited with as long a list of instincts as the animals. 
We turn next to a consideration of this list. 
Some Asserted Instincts in Man.—The following is a more 
or less conventional list of human instincts. , The account is taken 
largely from Thorndike’s ‘‘Qriginal Nature of Man.’’ While 
there are certain additions of his own, the list was originally 
compiled from Preyer, Schneider and William James. Not all 
of the instincts listed by Thorndike are given here. 
“ 1+ Acquisition and Possession.—To any not too large object and 
to ie aiich does not arouse fear, the original response is ap- 
proach, or if the child is within reaching distance, reaching, touch- 
ing, grasping. Then follows putting the object into the mouth, 
or manipulation. To the situation of a person or animal grab- 
bing or making off with an object which one holds or has near him, 
the response is a tightening of the hold upon the article, pushing, 
striking and screaming at the intruder. 
It will be seen that reaching and grasping are put down as 
part reactions. Reaching, grasping and release of object, while 
they have instinctive elements, nevertheless must be tremen- 
dously modified by habit before they are of any service. See 
the work on Lee, page 296, on reaching for the candy and 
the candle. 
| Hunting.—To a small escaping object, man, especially if 
‘hungry, responds apart from training by pursuit. When near 
enough he pounces upon it and seizes it. If seized, he inspects,  
-P-A-G-E-288
  276 PSYCHOLOGY: 
manipulates and dismembers it. If the object is larger, he responds 
much the same way, only he is more likely to throw himself upon 
it and bear it to the ground, choke and, maul it until it ceases 
to move. 
No one has ever made any such observation as this. The only 
hunting we know anything about comes long after differential 
responses with respect to animals have been developed. Thorn- 
dike’s description is undoubtedly true with respect to animals, 
but it is a mere word picture so far as human activity goes. I 
have seen infants and children and monkeys pull and rotate any 
moving organ of an animal, poke at the eyes, ete. By the time 
the infant is strong enough to really dismember an animal, the 
seizing-pulling-pouncing activities have been overlaid by habit, 
and oftentimes with distorted habits which go by the name of 
eruelty (unfortunately the limits of this volume do not allow 
us to treat of sadistic and masochistic tendencies). ’ All that we 
ean see in the ‘‘hunting’’ instinct until habit modifies it is a 
positive reaction towards certain objects dead or alive, and 
manipulation. 
-  Collecting and Hoarding—lIt is assumed that there is a 
“blind”? tendency to take up any positively reacted to object 
and carry it home. This crystallizes into collecting and storing 
objects, such as money, marbles, string, tops, postage stamps, pic- 
ture post-cards, valentines, ete. : 
If the psycho-analysists are to be believed, collecting and hoard- 
ing are indicative of a great many factors which are anything 
but instinctive. Our own comment is that there is little here 
which might be called instinctive. Children will grow up in a 
rather sheltered environment, with no tendency to collect or 
hoard. So far as we can observe, their reactions are more like 
those of the monkey: they do reach out and grasp and manipu- 
late everything, but they drop or throw down the first object 
and reach for the next until the attendant is wearied. As soon 
as constructive habits are formed, hoarding may occur. It is 
usually, though, a struggle from infancy to get the child to keep 
its playthings collected. One of the hardest habits in the world 
to form is that of neatness—putting things back into the hoard, 
both as regards toys and personal belongings. The tendency is 
all the other way—toward the monkey, scattering type of be-, 
havior. With money the situation is much the same. Insurance 
statistics show that only about 4 per cent. of men at 60 years _ 
of age have ‘‘hoarded’’ capital enough to give them a living 
income for the rest: of their expected lives. When children start 
out into the social group, they hoard what the others hoard. For 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: INSTINCT 277 
one or two months the youngster’s pockets are weighed down 
with marbles, two months later it may be tops. They usually col- 
lect whatever the group is actually using. Tops give way to 
roller-skating, an activity in which hoarding is certainly not essen- 
tial. The earliest hoarding noticed in two children under our 
observation was of post-cards and letters from the parents and 
then from friends. But this was done under the very evident 
suggestion of the attendants. 
Habitation—We quote James: ‘‘There can be no doubt that 
the instinct to seek a sheltered nook, open only on one side, into 
which he may retire and be safe, is in man quite as specifie as 
the instinct of birds to build a nest. It is not necessarily in the 
shape of a shelter from wet and cold that the need comes before 
him, but he feels less exposed and more at home when not alto- 
gether unenclosed than when lying all abroad. . . . Habits 
of the most complicated kind are reared upon it. But even in 
the midst of these habits we see the blind instinct cropping out; 
as, ¢.g., in the fact that we feign a shelter by backing our beds in 
rooms with their heads against the wall, and never lying in them 
the other way.’’ 
There are a great many unanalyzed factors in James’ state- 
ment. For example, he does not tell us ati all what the situation 
is which leads to such acts. His observation of the way people 
sleep is certainly superficial. Babies and children apparently 
sleep just as well with the crib or bed in one location in the room 
as another; as they grow older the habit is formed of sleeping 
in such a way that vision is not obstructed. Vision is interfered 
with unless we back ‘‘our beds in rooms with their heads against 
the wall.’’ Were it not to keep warm or cool, or to be protected 
from insects, animals and marauders, there would probably 
be exhibited no tendency to sleep in a bed in an enclosed place. 
The argument might be turned around just as well: ‘‘There is 
a strong instinct in man to keep away from all habitation and 
to sleep out in the open.’’ Just as good a case can be made out 
for it. His whole description seems to be an endeavor to find 
something in the acts of the human being which corresponds to 
such acts in the animal. This is very curiously present in all 
writings on instinct. It is the opposite of the anthropomor- 
phic description in animal behavior. There we try to make the ani- 
mal into a human; here we try to make the human a lower animal. 
Migration —It is often asserted that there are two closely 
related but opposite instincts, one for migration and the other for 
domesticity. Upholders of these asserted tendencies cite the 
tramp. Says Flint (quoted from Thorndike) : ‘‘I have known 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
  278 PSYCHOLOGY 
men on the road who were tramping purely and simply because 
they loved to tramp. They had no appetite for liquor or tobacco, 
so far as I could find, also were quite out of touch with criminals 
and their habits; but somehow or other they could not conquer 
that passion for roving. In a way this type of vagabond is the 
most pitiful that I have ever known; and yet it is the truest 
type of the genuine voluntary vagrant—to reform him it is neces- 
sary to kill his personality, to take away his ambition—and this 
is a task almost superhuman. Even when he has reformed he 
is a most cast-down person.”’ 
The superficiality of this analysis is clearly evident. There 
are a great many factors mixed up which are more fundamental 
than any instinct towards migration, such as homosexuality, 
pederasty, the reaction against authority, ete. While it is true 
that a great many children, some as young as two and three years, 
begin to break bounds and to stay away for several hours at a 
time, and from seven years on begin to stay away at night, there 
are usually upon analysis complicating home factors, the example 
of older boys, ete., to be taken into consideration, which consid- 
erably weaken the argument for a pure migratory instinct. 
Fighting.—Fighting is listed as one of the principal instinc- 
tive tendencies. We have already in part discussed this under 
emotions, page 239. Where the overt, explicit activity is empha- 
sized, it is properly classed as an instinct, and an all-important 
one. It has been so well discussed in psychological literature that 
it need not detain us here. 
Maternal Instincts—Thorndike says: ‘‘To a woman who has 
given birth to a child, a baby to see and hold and suckle is per- 
haps the most potent satisfaction life can offer, its loss the cause 
of saddest yearning. To a woman who has given birth to a child, 
the baby she sees, holds and nurses appeals almost irresistibly 
when it gives a ery of hunger, pain or distress, the start of sur- 
prise, the scream of fear, the smiles of comfort, the cooing, and 
gurgling and shouting of vocal play.’’ 
A great many other psychologists also idealize the parental 
behavior in this way. To those who work in maternity wards 
the situation is sometimes seen to be quite otherwise. We have 
observed the nursing, handling, bathing, ete., of the first baby 
of a good many mothers. Certainly there are no new ready- 
made activities appearing except nursing. The mother is usually 
as awkward about that as she can well be. The instinctive factors 
are practically nil.. The emotional activity of both parents may 
be intense, but this is often the result of many factors. The in- 
fant thus comes as a ‘‘loaded’’ stimulus. Very often the mother 
poe,
-P-A-G-E-291
  / 
HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: INSTINCT 279 
who is unshackled by social conventions behaves quite differently 
from the way she should behave if Thorndike’s pictures were cor- 
rect. Even in cases where the woman is duly married and there 
js no reason for a loading or a transfer of an emotional state of 
an adverse kind upon the child, little maternal behavior of the 
type described above appears. Society puts the strongest pres- 
sure upon a conventional attitude with respect to the proper 
care of the youngster and the emotional attitude which should 
be displayed with reference to it. We are not denying, however, 
that there are some instinctive factors here. It should be re- 
called that the nursing of the child and the fondling of it is not 
without a sex stimulating effect upon the mother. 
There is a stronger and stronger tendency among educated 
women to break away from the sentimental drivel connected with 
the rearing of the child and to make a scientific problem of it. 
Just to the extent to which convention permits it, rationalization 
occurs. This is a strong argument that maternal behavior is not 
mainly instinctive. Rationalization does not mean that strong 
attachments of the type we have already discussed may not grow 
up between parent and child. But regardless of its ultimate 
analysis we should be the last to undervalue the tremendous réle 
maternal behavior plays in society as a whole. 
Gregari ess—The activities displayed by children and 
adults brought about by the stimulus of being left alone are often 
called the gregarious instinct. The observed responses are wan- 
dering ffom placé to place, restlessness, verbal complaint and 
actual seeking movements. If long continued the situation leads 
even the adult to break all bounds and to overcome many ob- 
stacles in order to mix with his fellow-man. Caste and social 
distinctions are broken down, and the most exalted—person will 
fraternize with the humblest. When actually with the group the 
restlessness dies away even though the individual does not enter 
into any kind of social_relation with his fellows, but merely idles 
along with them from place to place. Often the presence of a 
dog or a cat or of another human being far too young to serve as 
a real companion will suffice to cause the restlessness and seeking 
movements to disappear. Solitary confinement is one of the 
severest of punishments. These tendencies have been well worked 
out in MeDougall’s Social Psychology and in Le Bon’s The 
Crowd. It is possible to analyze still further the instinct into 
simpler factors, but it is so well consolidated and so generally 
- recognized (although there are many exceptions) that analysis 
seems to be out of place. Our cafés, boulevards, churches and 
county fairs are dependent upon it to a certain extent. 
   
-P-A-G-E-292
  280 PSYCHOLOGY 
“ Other So-Called Social Instincts—Social psychologists have 
overemphasized the instinctive factors in the activities enumer- 
ated below. Man is supposed to exhibit special instinctive tend- 
encies in his behavior to other human beings. It is asserted 
that the human face is too early singled out by the child from 
all other objects for the process to be anything but instinctive. 
Our insight into the early functioning of the conditioned reflexes 
teaches us to expect that the baby would ‘‘single out’’ the person 
handing the bottle (or giving the breast) before all other persons. 
There are certainly very slight grounds for assuming instinctive 
factors here. Any object, a moving dancing manikin, for ex- 
ample, that could feed the infant, keep it dry and warm, pet it, 
ete., would be singled out just as early. Young ducks hatched 
out by the hen follow her around, single her out and learn her 
haunts, but surely no one would claim that there was anything 
more present than the following instinct plus habits which had 
beer built up. Similar conclusions with respect to the lack of 
many instinctive factors must be drawn in the cases of the 
so-called ‘‘atlention getting,’ ‘‘responses to approving and 
scornful behavior,’’ ‘‘mastering and submissive behavior,’ ‘‘dis- 
play,’’ ete. These are all important aspects of man’s total be- 
havior, but there seem to be no just grounds for assuming that 
the activities are carried out at the instinctive level. Undoubt- 
edly just after birth conditioned reflexes begin to form with 
respect to the attendants and parents long before systematized 
habits begin to form. In other words, there is a genuine condi- 
tioned reflex level of functioning lying between the retlex-instinct 
level and the organized habit level. Many of the connections * 
described in the older texts as instinctive are formed during 
this period. We have already shown how quickly and at what 
an early age children learn to control the parents’ actions—erying 
when left alone, when put down in the dark, when put to bed, 
etc., is a favorite trick. Retching and vomiting at the sight of 
certain foods is another; going into a rage when something is 
taken away from it is another (the parent often returns the 
object, thus ‘‘giving way”’ to the child). This conditioning of 
activity occurs so early that it is no wonder many observers have 
ereated ‘‘attention-getting’’ and other instincts. 
Imitation —Psychologists and students of animal behavior 
generally are more or less divided in their opinion as to the 
presence of any function to imitate both in animals and in man. 
The analysis of the instinct has been very superficial. Thorn- - 
dike’s characterization of the stimulus and response is probably, 
as accurate as any we have. It is as follows: ‘‘Smiling when. 4
-P-A-G-E-293
  HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: INSTINCT 281 
smiled at, laughing when others laugh, yelling when others yell, 
looking at what is observed, listening when others listen, running 
with or after people who are running in the same direction, run- 
ning from the focus whence others scatter, jabbering when others 
jabber and becoming silent as they become silent, crouching when 
others crouch, chasing, attacking and rending what others hunt, 
and seizing whatever object another seizes.”’ 
Manipulation —This instinctive tendency is sometimes exalted 
by calling it constructiveness. That there is an original tend- 
ency to reach out-for objects, to scrape them along the floor; 
to pick them up, put thenrinto the mouth, to throw them upon 
the floor, to move back and forth any parts which can be moved, 
is one of the best grounded and best observed of the instincts. 
From our point of view this instinct to manipulate, even though 
it must be supplemented, as we brought out above, by certain 
habit faetors, is probably the most important of all original tend- 
encies in view of the fact that nearly all later habit formations 
are dependent upon it. When we say most important here, we 
are neglecting for the moment the instincts connected with bodily 
functions, as sex, the eliminative functions, ete. Curiosity is 
often listed as one of the important human instincts. The activ- 
ities seen in curiosity are embraced in those connected with 
manipulation. Veblen, the economist, uses the instinct of work- 
manship as a pillar for his economic, theories. It is doubtful 
whether there are any instinctive factors there which are not 
embraced in manipulation, positive and negative reaction 
tendencies, etc. 
Y Other Asserted Instincts.—Other asserted instincts are greed, 
kindliness, teasing, tormenting, bullying, cleanliness, adornment. 
Further observation and analysis of these activities are necessary 
before it can be decided to what extent instinctive factors are 
present. Psychologists persistently maintain that cleanliness is 
instinctive, in spite of the filth of the negro, of the savage and of 
the child. It is a fight with most children from birth until the 
competition of sex occurs to get them to properly wash their 
hands and face and body as a whole, not to speak of smaller 
matters such as washing the ears, keeping the teeth brushed 
and the nails eut and cleaned. Even the adult, highly conven- 
tionalized individual omits his daily plunge and lets his beard 
grow when living in an unsocial environment. The functioning 
of the instinct is supposed to occur when slimy, sticky substances 
are grasped. Our own observations on this point are cited 
on page 269. i 
Play.—Play is a form of instinctive activity the stimulus to 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
  "282 PSYCHOLOGY 
which is unquestionably in doubt. Play as a whole seems to be 
made up really of a variety of activities, all functioning more or 
less together. Manipulation is one of the most easily observable 
of the activities; ‘then, foo, there are rapid shifts of facial ex- 
pression, vocalization, running toward and away from, crawling, 
hiding, ete. The activities under the influence of social factors 
soon become organized into the various games, or individual habit 
activity such as the making of mud piés, building with blocks, 
caring for, playing with and feeding small animals, ete. 
‘We undoubtedly see in the play+ activities of children the 
cubrxauie activities of the adults, playing house, cooking, pet- 
ting dolls, ete. “Here the shaping or training activities of a 
parent are easily observable. If a young human were to grow 
up in isolation, it is probable that he would play, but the form 
of the play would, without doubt, be entirely different from that 
observed in children brought up under modern eonditions of 
civilization. Kipling has with some skill pictured the growth of 
Mowgli, who was suckled by the wolf and brought up in the 
forest. with animals as playmates. 
Groos has advanced a biological theory of play. Play, accord- 
ing to him, is a biological tendency. The young animal engages 
in those functions which will be of service to it in later life. He 
sees in the running, jumping, tumbling, fighting, early sex re- 
sponses, ete., the perfecting of those activities which the animal 
will use when the struggle for food, mate, ete., begins. This 
theory really has nothing to recommend it. 
‘General Comments on the Above Instincts.—We are in- 
elined to take the point of view here also that most of these 
asserted instincts are really consolidations of instinct and habit. 
In certain of them, such as manipulation, the original activities 
predominate. In certain others, e.g., adornment, hunting, hab- 
itation, ete., the pattern as a whole is largely composed of habit 
elements. It should again be reiterated here that so far as the 
functioning and value of these attitudes to the organism, so far 
as the réle they play in daily life, so far as their backward and 
forward reference in the life history of the individual are 
concerned, it makes not a whit’s difference what factors these 
capacities are analyzable into. The geneticist is likely to overem- 
phasize the number of original tendencies; the psycho-analyst, to 
underestimate them. He reduces instincts almost as a class to 
a few stereotyped factors connected with the (from his stand- 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
  HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: INSTINCT 283 
point, fundamental) sex phenomena. The fact of the matter 
seems to be that in most cases there is no need of detailed analysis 
of these attitudes. Those that we have cited and many others 
function as wholes in the daily lives of all individuals. They 
are as potent and real as if they were inborn and. began to fune- 
tion in earliest infancy with all the completeness they exhibit 
in adult life. 
The Instinctive-Sex_Responses.—The subject of the com- 
plete manifestation of the instinct of sex is too vast for brief 
treatment. We have already discussed some of the implicit fac- 
tors in connection with the emotion of love, and indicated there 
how attachments (conditioned reflexes) might grow up to per: 
sons and objects that stimulate the erogenous zones of the child, 
as in bathing, rocking and petting. We are dealing here, though, 
with a primitive order of habits and not with instincts. There 
seems to be no original tendency to approach the sex organs with 
the hands as there is to approach the mouth. In some five hun- 
dred observations of infants varying in age from birth to three 
hundred days we have never seen any instinctive tendency on 
the part of the child to approach the sex organs with the hands. 
Observation shows that even when the child is pinched or scratched 
on the sole of the foot the tendency for the hand is always upward 
and toward the face and rarely downward. The finding of the 
sex organs seems to be something of a genuine discovery, like 
the finding of the feet and toes (which occurs, of course, much 
earlier—150 days). Once discovered, habits of distortion may 
possibly grow up. Undoubtedly there are a large number of 
purely instinctive responses connected with those organs. 
The sex instinct as a whole has very many ramifications. 
Habits of the most varied kinds are built upon and around it. 
The study of the normal sex ‘‘sublimations’’ leads us into the 
whole field of human activity from folk-lore to philosophic and 
artistic productions. The study of sex perversions leads us very 
quickly into the field of the psychoses. 
Inhibition and Control of Instinct——The problems connected 
with the breaking down of instincts and their replacement by 
habit are of both practical and theoretical interest. Where in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
284. PSYCHOLOGY 
stinets are distorted they must often be broken down before 
normal activities can be given an opportunity for development. 
Furthermore, many of the perfectly normal instincts must be 
brought under social control before the individual is prepared 
to mingle with his fellow-men. One of the earliest examples of 
the socialization of normal instinctive acts is illustrated by the 
teaching of the infant continence with respect to its eliminative 
functions. Here the instinctive activities are left intact so far as 
the pattern is concerned, but the situation for the release of 
these activities is made more complex. The mother starts the 
process of control very simply by taking the child to the toilet 
every two hours or oftener and leaving it there until those acts are 
performed, and then bringing it back to its more customary and 
normal environment. The association grows up rapidly in nor- 
mal children. Thereafter, the intra-organic stimulus (pressure 
of urine and feces) leads the child to make some sign, usually 
a vocal one, which stimulates the mother to gather it up and 
carry it to the proper place for the performance of those func- 
tions. As the child grows older, the pressure of such stimuli 
touches off the act of going to the proper place of his own accord. 
The extra-organic stimulation (the new situational factor, the 
sight and contact of the toilet) leads to the act of evacuation. 
There are thus a large number of habit activities built up around 
the instinctive function, but the latter as such is left prae- 
tically untouched except for a momentary initial inhibition 
(sphincter control). 
A case in which the pattern itself is altered to some extent 
ean be illustrated most simply from animal life. The bird dog 
when taught to retrieve, at first instinctively bites the bird when 
he grasps it, especially if it is wounded and fluttering. It is often 
difficult to get this part of the pattern broken up. It can be done 
by filling the dead bird with pins. If the dog then mouths 
the bird at all severely, the points prick him and it is necessary 
for him to close down very gently indeed when he brings the 
bird in if he is to avoid pain stimulation. Dogs and eats often 
suck eggs, which is a purely instinctive function with dogs at 
least. They can be cured by filling the egg with quinine or
-P-A-G-E-297
  
HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: INSTINCT 285 
cayenne pepper. In these illustrations there is the actual break- 
ing down of a part of the reaction pattern by reason of the 
changes introduced into the stimulus. The stimulus becomes 
other than it was. Instead of leading now to action a + b + ¢ 
-- d, for example, smelling at, licking the egg, cracking the shell 
and lapping up the contents, it leads to action a + x, i.e. to 
smelling and avoiding. Some children suck the fingers instine- 
tively from birth. If not corrected, it may continue long after 
the infancy period. The most usual way of breaking the instinct 
is to place something upon the fingers that will lead to another 
reaction (quinine, pepper, ete.), or else to make the action im- 
possible by putting a cardboard tube on the arm so that the elbow 
cannot be bent. The instinct dies here because the act cannot be 
completed. Society puts a good deal of emphasis upon right- 
handedness. If handedness is instinctive as is most generally 
assumed, we have in the breaking up of left-handedness a study 
in the displacement of an instinct. Everything is offered to 
the child’s right hand, people shake hands with it with the right 
hand, the parents place everything in such a way that the right 
hand will be used much more frequently than the left. All habits, 
then, are built up around the right hand and left-handedness dies 
by inanition, 7.e., through lack of stimulation. Habits of a per- 
nicious character are often as difficult to break up as are instincts. 
Summarizing the general principle by means of which we 
break up or control instinct, we may. say that we may break up 
an instinct by (1) arranging the environmental factors in such 
a way that the instinct cannot take place; the organism is re- 
strained to such an extent that although the movement is ini- 
tiated, it cannot be completed. Examples, tying down the hand 
of the child, muzzling the dog, harnessing the cow (to prevent 
its sucking its own milk). While the animal is restrained, we 
build up habits with respect to those objects which have hitherto 
been instinctively reacted to—the burglar often feeds the watch- 
dog in the daytime and speaks gently to him while the animal is 
tied up, hoping that when released at night the friendly habits 
with respect to himself will inhibit the instinct to rend and tear. 
(2) On the other hand, we can alter the stimulus, as shown by
-P-A-G-E-298
    286 PSYCHOLOGY 
the illustrations of the doctoring of the egg, putting pepper on 
the baby’s fingers, ete. The stimulus then touches off once at 
least and usually several times the old reaction, but the new 
elements added to the stimulus touch off something in addition to 
the old instinct pattern, viz., an avoidance reaction, possibly also 
vomiting, hanging out of the tongue to cool it, ete. This phase 
of the stimulus may become so emphasized that the avoiding reac- 
tion may be the first to appear the next time the stimulus is 
presented. 
In adult life the process of ‘‘habituation’’ is probably the most 
potent factor in eliminating especially the instinctive fear tend- 
encies (even though many such reactions are conditioned, they 
are often fully as powerful factors as if they were native). The 
movie of a workman going out over a single iron: beam twenty 
stories up from the ground produces many fear reactions on our 
part and sometimes nausea. If forced actually to walk such a 
beam suddenly yourself for the first time, it would produce faint- 
ing and falling without much question. When led gradually to 
it, it is soon done as readily. as any other act. So with climbing 
to high places, rushing into burning buildings, taming lions and 
tigers, ete. Habit gradually makes the thing possible. 
An interesting example of the breaking up of an instinct 
by. experimental methods is cited by Partridge. On a visit to 
Central Park in New York he noted that the observers around 
the snakes’ cage blinked and jumped back (defensive reflex) 
each time one of the cobras struck the glass. In order partially 
to duplicate the situation for an experiment on the breaking up 
of the instinct he set up a piece of heavy plate glass in front of his 
subjects and devised a mechanism which would release a rubber- 
faced wooden-headed hammer for striking against the glass. 
The hammer struck the glass at the level of the subjects’ eyes. 
At first, of course, the subject blinked and drew back each time 
the hammer approached the eye. As the subject became more 
habituated to the situation inhibition occurred. The following 
figures refer to the number of times the wink was inhibited in 
each of a series of four hundred trials: 6, 14, 38, 65, 268, 352. 
That is, inhibition occurred only six times in the first four hun-
-P-A-G-E-299
  
HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: INSTINCT 287 
dred trials, whereas it occurred 352 times in the last four hun- 
dred trials. 
The Recapitulation Theory.—Under the influence of sev- 
eral non-biologically trained psychologists, a rather persistent 
but nevertheless pernicious theory of the stages of childhood 
activity has grown up. This is known as the recapitulation 
theory. It holds, in short, that ontogeny repeats phylogeny— 
that the developing child must pass through all the stages that 
the race has passed through. He should thus by rights pass 
through a fish stage of activity, a monkey stage, a primitive man 
stage, ete. Certain psychologists have seriously subscribed to 
such statements as the following: ‘‘A babe a few days old 
made peculiar paddling or swimming movements.’’ ‘‘In children 
andadults . . . we find swaying from side to side or backward 
or forward, not infrequent. This suggests the slow vacillatory 
movements used by fish.’? The best corrective for such harmful 
conceptions is a real genetic study of the child and a deeper 
knowledge of biology. 
Principal Réle of the Unlearned Activities——Though the 
perfect native pattern responses in man be few in number, his 
wealth of native, partially organized reactions is quite impor- 
tant. In general it seems safe to summarize their rdle in the 
organization of man as follows: 
1. Man is supplied'with a large number of directly adaptive 
life-conserving activities which care for the intake, digestion and 
distribution of food products and for the elimination of waste 
and for procreation. These purely vegetative functions serve 
him as they serve animals lower than man and are possibly just 
as ‘‘ perfect.’’ 
2. Man at birth and at varying periods thereafter is supplied 
with a series of protective attack and defense mechanisms, 
which while not nearly so perfect as in animals, nevertheless 
form a substantial repertoire of acts. They need supplemen- 
tation by habit before being of direct utility to the individual in 
his struggle for food, against enemies, ete. These are the pro- 
tective and defense reactions—the unlearned part activities at 
first predominate.
-P-A-G-E-300
  288 PSYCHOLOGY 
3. Then follow the occupational activities (manipulation) 
consisting mainly of habit—seen in collection, hoarding, build- 
ing of blocks, hammering and the use of tools generally, draw- 
ing, modelling in clay, etc. In the crude stage of these activi- 
ties, instinctive factors may be operative but their presence is 
hard to demonstrate. The instinctive factors are, even if they 
exist, soon lost sight of in the technique of the skilled workman, 
the artist and the collector. These variations in activities are 
seen at very early ages in children. Modern school methods, 
and especially the college, tend to break down these desirable 
childhood slants towards manipulations and occupations. One 
rarely finds a lad of twelve who cannot tell exactly what he 
wants to become, what he is fitted for and why he is fitted for it. 
By the time he has had all of his earlier attained manipulative 
organization cultivated out of him in college, he can rarely tell 
what he is fitted for, and he drifts now into this work, now into 
- that, depending upon. his father’s business, temporary openings, 
the traditions of the school, or the aspirations of his parents or 
other backers. 
4. Individuality seems in some way to depend upon man’s 
unlearned behavior, not upon the presence of completed pattern 
types of responses, since these do not exist in any large number, 
but apparently upon factors which, when taken singly, are dif- 
ficult to detect, but which when taken together are most im- 
portant. There is not much experimental evidence for this con- 
clusion, but there is a great deal of common-sense data. We 
have in mind such differentiation as “follows: Two men with 
similar and equal training and approximately equal in ability in 
any skilled field, each capable of turning out fine work, will show 
individuality in workmanship, design and method of approaching 
their problems. Two equally skilled pitchers or catchers in base- 
ball show this very well. Two men working upon lathes, or mod- 
elling in clay, or making drawings of the same microscopic slide 
illustrate it. Apparently there are differences in the part activi- 
ties which have persisted in spite of instruction. We dignify 
these in the artist by the terms ‘‘ touch ”’, ‘‘ technic ’’, ‘‘ individ- 
uality ’’, ete. The fact that they have persisted seems to prove 
mainly that we are all put together differently—nervous sys-
-P-A-G-E-301
  
HEREDITARY MODES OF RESPONSE: INSTINCT 289 
tems-circulatory, respiratory-glandular, all differ in detail: 
Again our muscular, tendinous and bony structures differ— 
some of us are put together with long fingers, some with thick, 
stubby ones; some with flexible joints, some with stiff ones. 
Many of the behavior differences are but the natural correlates 
of inherited structure—it hardly seems fair to call these differ- 
ences instinctive. 
5. As may be inferred from this whole chapter, and we shall 
still more clearly bring the matter out in the following chapter, 
the principal role of all unlearned activity, neglecting the vege- 
tative and procreative (the latter especially is not lacking in habit 
supplementation), is to initiate the process of learning. In an 
object does not call out either a positive or a negative response, 
the formation of a habit with respect to that object is impossible 
unless we take measures to condition a response.

CHAPTER VIII 
THE GENESIS AND RETENTION OF EXPLICIT BODILY 
HABITS 
  A. ACQUISITION. 
Introduction—In the preceding two chapters we have dealt 
with the hereditary assets of man—his untutored ways of acting. 
It was clear from our study that if man were forced to make 
adjustments with only his inborn equipment his behavior would 
be lacking in that complexity and variety which we know exists in 
the adult. In habit we come to a higher and more varied level 
of functioning. For some reason a misconception has grown up 
in regard to habit. Many regard the term in a somewhat sinister 
way—as implying something that is inevitable, invariable and 
indeed somewhat fatal. To them it means the drug habit or 
alcoholism or some other pathological manifestation of activity. 
It is best to clear away such misconceptions since habits in our 
sense represent the bulwark of human organization. 
A Conditioned Reflex Level of Functioning—Between the 
purely instinct-reflex level of activity seen at birth and the level 
represented by definite habits of the type we are about to con- 
sider there is a stage of activity of the habit kind deserving more 
consideration than it has hitherto received. Not until the child 
begins to handle and generally manipulate objects, to build with 
blocks or clay, to crawl or walk from spot to spot and to put on 
language habits is it a going human concern. But it is unthink- 
able that a mass of individual acquisitions is not put on before 
this level is reached. We have discussed this phase of activity 
in several places—in the attachment and detachment of reac- 
tions to emotional stimuli and in connection with the positive 
and negative reactions which develop at a very early age. It 
remains to call special attention to it in connection with habit. 
The pattern of this early activity is not complex and for this 
reason it is often spoken of as being the putting on of new instine- 
290
-P-A-G-E-303
fs 
  EXPLICIT BODILY HABITS 291 
tive part activities. Our own view is that they are of the con- 
ditioned reflex type and are therefore acquired. The whole 
level should receive a far more extended study since the peda- 
gogical aspect for parent and teacher is most important. To 
dwell for any length of time upon it here is out of place. But 
it is believed that the child is often made or broken at just this 
stage. One needs only to call attention to the mass of objects that 
gets tied up with the fear responses, or the way the eighty-day-old 
infant learns to control its attendants by crying and giving way 
to rage. We recall these statements made in other connections in 
order to emphasize the point here that habits of the type we 
shall now consider are not the earliest to develop. 
The Nature of Habit.—Any definite mode of acting, either 
explicit or implicit in character, not belonging to man’s hereditary 
equipment, must be looked upon as a habit.) It is an individually 
acquired or learned act. We have already pointed out that 
from the moment of birth the infant when not sleeping is 
moving almost ceaselessly the arms, hands, legs, eyes, head, 
and indeed the whole body. Stimulate him in any way and 
these movements become more frequent and increase in amplitude. 
Under the influence of intra-organic stimulation as seen in the 
hyperactivity of the smooth-muscle contractions in hunger and 
thirst, and especially in the hypersecretion of the ductless glands 
in rage, fear and other emotional activity, these movements become 
much more numerous. In pain, likewise, the number of move- 
ments is increased. It can’ be maintained from our experimental 
work on habit that the autonomic system furnishes the restless 
seeking or avoiding movements of the body as a whole which 
lead the organism to display the instinctive repertoire out of 
which habits are composed. The question as to whethér the ex- 
teroceptive sense organs (eyes, ears and nose) ever furnish this 
initial drive in the absence of autonomic activity is not so easily 
answered. It is maintained by psychologists generally that the 
moving, the flashing of bright objects, the sounding of noises, 
and in cael the application of distance receptor stimuli, can 
inerease the number and amplitude of these initial movements. 
It must be remembered, though, that such stimuli arouse the 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
292 PSYCHOLOGY 
sympathetic nervous system which stirs up the smooth muscles 
~ and glands. It may be the return afferent impulses from these 
organs which set the seeking activity in the striped muscles in 
motion. The whole series of questions involved can be focalized 
by asking whether a hypothetically eviscerated animal depend- 
ing upon the reflex ares ending in the striped muscles alone would 
ever display that activity which would lead to habit formation. 
Our own view is that habits would not be formed. It seems equally 
probable, though, that once they were formed in a normal animal 
they could be called out after evisceration if in some way the 
animal could be kept alive. Fortunately we do not have to answer 
such a question, since we are working with our animal as a whole 
and since the’slightest observation will show that the habit-form- 
ing activities in a human being are present at birth and in all 
probability before birth.   
+The whole matter can be put in another way by stating what is meant 
by an adjustment. We will use a simple illustration: Suppose that the 
animal has been without food for some time: rhythmical contractions begin 
in the stomach which serve as stimuli for arousing the animal as a whole 
to activity. We call such activity “restless,” “positive” or “ seeking.” 
They continue until by some customary or chance act food is grasped, carried 
to the mouth and eaten. The moment the food touches the stomach the 
rhythmical contractions in its walls die away and the restless seeking 
activity disappears. The animal is said to be adjusted—but only with 
respect to food. If the environment does not permit the act which will 
bring the cessation of such movements—that is, if he is restrained from 
acting or no food is at hand—he may do something else, for example, walk 
until exhausted. In time, however, the restless movements may disappear 
without food having been eaten; that is, the rhythmical contractions end of 
their own accord after a certain period—adjustment has taken place, but 
not of an organically safe kind. In our illustration the original, oftentimes 
called driving or compelling stimulus, was organic activity. Such are 
sometimes designated as needs or hungers. There is a strong tendency now 
to hold that the organism is always acting, even when displaying highly 
organized habits, under the influence of an organic stimulus—we have 
already brought out the fact that such stimuli in the glands and smooth 
muscles are very varied—and that man’s ordinary reactions to things and 
people are the equivalents of his taking food in the above illustration. He 
becomes adjusted only when he reacts in such a way as to bring about the 
disappearance of the particular organic stimulus which is acting at the 
moment, 
 
-P-A-G-E-305
  EXPLICIT BODILY HABITS 293 
Certainly at birth or shortly thereafter the elements or unit 
acts out of which every habit is formed can be noted. We men- 
tion the contraction and flexion of the fingers, of the lower and 
upper arm, raising and lowering of the head, rotation of the head, 
bending the trunk from side to side and backward and forward, 
well-systematized movements of the legs, and a host of others. 
The conclusion is forced upon us that in habit no new elementary 
movements are needed. There are enough present at birth and 
more than will ever be combined into complex unitary acts. 
Since so many of the psychological texts speak freely of the 
formation of ‘‘new pathways’’ in habit it seems well to call 
attention to the simple mathematical fact that the number of 
permutations and combinations of, say, one hundred unit acts is 
a staggering number. Such speculations, though, are futile. One 
needs only to examine the five- or six-day-old infant to be reason- 
ably convinced that there is no need for the formation of addi- 
tional reflex ares to account for all later organization.” The new 
or learned element in habit is the tying together or integration of 
separate movements in such a way as to produce a new unitary ac- 
tivity. And by unitary activity we mean nothing more than the 
every-day acts of life, such as reaching out the hand for an object 
that stimulates the eye, picking the object up and carrying it to 
the mouth or laying it on the table; or picking up a hammer in 
the right hand, a nail in the left, holding the nail with the left, 
hammering with the right until the nail is started, then with- 
drawing the left hand and completing the process by driving the 
nail home. These are simple and elementary acts to be sure, 
seemingly far different from building a model airplane or writing 
a novel so far as complexity is concerned. But it probably takes 
the child a longer time to learn to drive a nail well than it takes 
an adult engineer to build an airplane. 
Instinct and habit are undoubtedly composed of the same 
elementary reflexes, They differ so far as concerns the origin 
  
*In stating the view this way we are of course neglecting some of the 
late appearing elementary reflex movements such as blinking, extension of 
the great toe in place of flexion when the sole of the foot is touched, and 
the late sex reflexes, 
 
-P-A-G-E-306
    294 PSYCHOLOGY 
of the pattérn (number and localization of the simple reflex ares 
involved amd the order (temporal relation) of the unfolding of 
the elements composing the pattern. In instinct the pattern and 
order are inherited, in habit both are acquired during the life- 
time of the individual. We can define habit then as we did in- 
stinet as a complex system of reflexes which functions in a serial 
order when the child or adult is confronted by the appropriate 
stimulus, provided we add the statement that in habit the pat- 
tern and order are acquired, whereas in instinct they are in- 
herited. it would follow from this definition that so far as the 
observance of a single adult performance is concerned we should 
not be able to tell an instinct from a habit, so that here again the 
genetie method is required to determine the relationship between 
the two. It should be noted that, usually, instinctive response 
is tied down fairly well to a definite particular stimulus or situ- 
ation, whereas in acquired activity one and the same object can 
call forth from an educated man literally hundreds of different 
actions depending upon slight differences in its setting or upon 
his needs at the moment. Think of the number of activities that 
can be called out from one and the same individual by a piece of 
lumber, leather, stone, marble or metal. 
Explicit and Implicit Types of Habit— On page 14 we 
divided habit into explicit and implicit types. The examples we 
gave of explicit habits were unlocking a door, tennis and violin 
playing. We should add talking, lecturing, writing, working at 
any vocation and, in fact, doing the thousands of things that we 
see individuals and groups doing from the moment of waking 
to the moment of sleeping. We deal here with overt activity 
which can be observed without instrumentation (the subject mat- 
ter largely of ordinary observation). While the whole body is 
involved in these acts, the most conspicuous and most easily 
observable phase of the activity is the combination of movements 
we see in the arms, legs and other motile organs of the striped- 
muscle system. So far no enumeration of the total acquisitions of 
this character has ever been attempted for the adult. A slight 
indication of their number can be gathered from investigating the 
word repertoire of individuals. The exceptional five-year-old 
 
-P-A-G-E-307
EXPLICIT BODILY HABITS 295 
child of a cultivated family can probably use more than two 
thousand words (page 843). Many uneducated adults never 
learn to use more than this number. The educated university 
man employs possibly five thousand words, the accomplished 
lexicographer can probably use appropriately ten to fifteen thou- 
sand words, giving the derivation of many of them. The number 
of acts, not counting the use of words, which have a name (for 
example, hammering, sawing, eating, reading) which an indi- 
vidual living a complex life does in the course of a week is enor- 
mous. When we contrast this wealth of possession with that of 
the infant of a hundred and twenty days, the age at which the 
simple eye-hand coérdination is forming, it can be seen what a 
tremendous journey the young individual must take in order 
to arrive at that stage of organization which is called for 
by society as a matter of course. The hereditary pattern 
acts fade into insignificance so far as concerns their number 
and complexity. 
The implicit-habit systems which we cannot observe except 
with the aid of instruments are probably equally as numerous if 
not more so and oftentimes more complex than the explicit. 
Many of the implicit habits have already been discussed under 
the heading of conditioned reflexes in the glands and in the un- 
striped muscles. of the implicit habits involving mainly the 
striped bodily musculature little is known except those connected 
with throat, tongue and larynx.) That a great many of the activ- 
ities involved in thinking are really implicit bodily movements, 
for example, of the shoulders, hands, fingers and other moving 
organs, is probable. A slight wave of the hand, the flicking of an 
eyebrow, the upward fling of the lip, a faintly muttered ‘‘humph’’ 
is the only organized immediate reaction we make towards many 
situations in life. Certainly in the deaf-mute not trained to speak 
the behaviorist assumes that all, thinking is carried out in terms 
of the nascent movements involved in the deaf and dumb alpha- 
bet, the Braille reading system, and in the bodily musculature as 
awhole. That there are many abridged processes there is as true 
as in the thinking of a normal adult. In the normal individual 
the great mass of implicit habit systems are formed in the laryn-
-P-A-G-E-308
  296 PSYCHOLOGY 
geal, tongue and throat muscles. They are in general word 
processes or the abbreviations of such. Naturally there are as 
many of these organized implicit activities as there are overt 
word responses and probably many more. 
' For ease of presentation only the acquisition of explicit bodily 
habits and their retention will be discussed in the present 
chapter. In Chapter IX the acquisition of explicit speech habits 
and the various forms of implicit habits will be taken up.

Genesis of Some Eye-Hand Codrdinations.—Systematic 
tests were begun upon LZ on the 80th day. She was carefully 
tested each week thereafter in such a way that progress in eye- 
hand codrdination could be observed. The method was as follows: 
The baby sat in the mother’s lap facing the experimenter. The 
mother supported her by placing her two hands upon the baby’s 
waist, thus leaving both arms entirely free. The experiments 
were carried out in a brilliantly lighted room, in the same room 
with all shades pulled down, and in the dark-room as occasion 
demanded. A stick of red peppermint candy of the old-fashioned 
kind, half an inch in diameter, was suspended in front of her 
within easy reaching distance. After dangling the candy for a 
minute or two it was put into her mouth by the experimenter if 
she failed to reach for it. This was done invariably, following the 
method found so serviceable in animal psychology. On the 94th 
day, having failed to reach for the candy on any preceding test, 
the candy was placed in the left hand in order to see how long it 
would take her to put it into the mouth. At the end of two minutes 
she had failed to make the adjustment with the left hand. When 
the candy was placed in her right hand she put it into her mouth 
immediately. Another trial with the left hand failed, another 
with the right hand was immediately successful. (We began 
to think that the child was right-handed). 
Age, 101 days. Candy dangled in front of her as before. 
She fixated the experimenter rather than the candy. She failed 
to reach for the candy on five presentations. On the last trial 
she seemed to open her hand and to make tentative striking move- Tue ACQUISITION OF Expiicit Bopity Hasits.

EXPLICIT BODILY HABITS 297 
ments. One interesting observation was made upon the way she 
put the candy into her mouth. After it was placed in her hand 
whenever she grasped the candy near one end and poked the 
long end into her mouth, she would push it, far back into her 
throat so that gagging ensued. She did this three times. It was 
evident that the contact of the object against the lips and tongue 
did not check the movement. The fingers had to reach the mouth 
before movement ceased. 
108 days. No advance in manipulation could be noted. 
115 days. Not much further advance in reaching. We ended 
the experiment by putting the candy first in the right hand and 
then in the left, recording the time it took her to put the candy 
in her mouth.

The left hand was thus fully as successful as the right in getting 
objects into the mouth. 
122 days. No evidence of reaching with the hands on first 
tests. Candy was placed on the tongue and then quickly removed, 
then advanced again toward the face. The head was almost im- 
mediately thrust forward with the lips pursed and the beginning 
of sucking movements took place. As the mouth approached the 
candy both hands were raised, one touching’ the experimenter’s 
hands. After an interval candy was again offered on the string. 
Grasped at it with left hand while pursing the lips. It was again 
offered. Grasped. at it with left hand, catching it and putting 
it into her mouth. On the next trial she made the effort to grasp 
it with her left hand but failed. 
129 days. Tested with candy suspended as before. At first 
would not fixate. Dangled it within six inches of the eyes. 
Slight movement was made with the right hand. The candy was 
then swung away and slowly brought back. Followed it with her 
eyes and when it was six inches distant from her face, she struck 
the candy with the back of her hand in two seconds, then pushed 
it over to the other hand, then to her chin, finally worrying it into

  298 PSYCHOLOGY 
her mouth. On the next trial there were no false movements in 
reaching. The right hand went slowly up and grasped the candy, 
and she pushed it up into her mouth without aid from her left 
hand. On the next trial she again reached definitely with her 
right hand and put it into her mouth. After these definite results 
we did not make any further tests because we wished to see if 
the first trials one week later would be just as definite. 
The grasping reflex was always tested at the end of each 
day’s test. On the 122nd day she was made to grasp the rod 
with difficulty and then only with her right hand. She swung for 
some seconds with this hand. On the above date she made no 
effort to grasp the rod at all, but by ‘‘worrying’’ her we suc- 
ceeded in getting her to hold on for 3°/, seconds (her time from 
the 35th to the 70th day would average around 12 to 15 seconds). 
136 days. Candy held as before. The right hand started up 
immediately, grasped the candy and carried it to the mouth. 
Time, 8 seconds. On the next trial the right hand was used. 
Time, 10 seconds. On the succeeding trial the right hand was 
used. Time, 8 seconds. The left hand did not assist in any of 
these adjustments. The thumb was not used. The whole act 
was quite clumsy. The mother was then made to shift the baby’s 
position slightly on her lap. When the candy was presented, 
both hands started out, but the right hand grasped and took the 
candy to the mouth. 
The grasping reflex was gone. Tested four times with the rod, 
but she could not cling. Defensive movements appeared. The 
right hand actually slapped the rod away. The left hand once 
momentarily grasped the rod, but she released her hold the 
moment she began to be lifted. : 
143 days. From this point on the detailed notes will not be 
given. In her reaching to-day the arms were outstretched at 
right angles to the body. She had the greatest difficulty in 
flexing the arm at the elbow. She would reach for the candy 
on her back and in the position for crawling. 
150 days. Movement quite definite, mainly with the right 
hand. Occasionally the left assisted. The whole process of 
reaching required in general about three seconds.
-P-A-G-E-311
  
EXPLICIT BODILY HABITS 299 
164 days. Left hand started first on nearly every test, but 
right hand succeeded in grasping the candy each time. The last 
five tests brought success in two seconds each for the whole 
operation. 
171 days. Succeeded first with the left hand, then twice 
with the right, then with both hands, then again with the right. 
The coordination was so well established after this that the details 
are not instructive. On the whole, Z used the right hand much 
more frequently than the left. At the age of two and a half years 
L was again tested. She is a well-developed child, walking and 
talking. She is completely right-handed. 
Reaching for the Candle.——While the tests on reaching for 
candy were being conducted she was tried frequently with an 
ordinary lighted wax candle. She was tested first on the 150th 
day (reaching for candy had been established, see above). The 
room was darkened. She reached immediately with the right 
hand, advancing the whole upper part of the body. She then 
held out both hands, reaching as far out from her mother’s lap 
as possible. Heat did not seem to make her withdraw even 
when the flame was held as close to her hand as an eighth of an 
inch. The candle was then held at a distance of one meter and 
moved in a circle at that distance. It was then slowly brought 
toward her face. She followed it definitely with the eyes. Ata 
distance of 20 centimeters she reached for it immediately with 
the right hand. On the second trial she started to reach at a 
distance of half a meter. On the third trial she began to reach 
at 30 centimeters. On the last three trials her hand: was allowed 
to touch the flame, causing flexion of the fingers, but this did not 
deter her from reaching. On the succeeding trial she reached 
immediately with the right hand, the flame touching the fingers 
and again causing flexion. The definite reflex withdrawal of the 
whole hand occurred sharply on this trial, but the child did not 
ery. Twenty-five trials in all were given. In most cases the 
hand was allowed to come close enough to cause flexion of the 
fingers. , 
157 days. Tested in the dark-room. When the candle was 
 
-P-A-G-E-312
  300 PSYCHOLOGY 
two meters away no attempt was made to reach for it, nor did 
she reach for it when it was held at one meter’s distance. When 
held at 20 centimeters she reached for it first with the left and 
then with the right. Many tests were again given on this day. 
She was often allowed to stick her fingers near enough to the 
flame to cause not only contraction of the fingers but actual 
withdrawal of the hand. 
164 days. ‘A similar set of tests was given. She would reach 
continually for the candle, regardless of the fact that her fingers 
were often scorched. 
178 days. Definite progress in avoidance was noted. When 
the candle was presented she reached out with her left hand, but 
only after an appreciable interval, during which she sucked her 
fingers. On the next trial she reached with her left hand imme- 
diately. On the next she reached with the left and scorched 
her fingers; again, left hand was started toward the candle but 
was checked. On the final trial she would not reach for it, but 
looked at it and sucked her fingers. 
220 days. Reaching for the candle persisted during the early 
trials. Her final reactions on this day were as follows: Left 
hand started out but was withdrawn. She then slapped at the 
light with her left hand. On the next trial she refused to reach 
for it, holding her left hand against her breast with the right 
clasped over it. On the next trial she started to reach out but 
pulled the hand back. Several other trials were given, but in 
only one did she actually reach out and grasp at the flame. The 
tests on this day show that the avoiding reaction is fairly well 
established. (In all, probably 150 trials were required to perfect 
the codrdination to the extent just noted.) 
These tests with the candle are given somewhat in detail both 
because of their intrinsic value in showing the rise of an avoid- 
ing reaction and by reason of the fact that a great deal of specu- 
lation and theorizing has been entered into in regard to the 
infant’s reaction to the candle. Holt has recently developed an 
ethical theory which centers around such a reaction as we have
-P-A-G-E-313
  EXPLICIT BODILY HABITS 301 
described.* It will be seen that the building up of the eodrdina- 
tions requires a long time when the flame is held near enough to 
produce the avoiding reaction. The habit as a whole grows up 
like any other habit. Whether the process would have been 
greatly hastened by allowing the child to be burned severely on 
the first test is, of course, not settled. Fear would have been 
produced very likely which would not only have extended to the 
candle but possibly also to the experimenter and to the whole 
experimental situation. Further tests of this kind would there- 
after have been impossible. As it was, the baby did not ery on 
any of the tests. 
We have carried out similar’ tests both on reaching for candy 
and for the candle upon several children (at least fifteen) with 
results wholly similar to the above. Experiments upon 7, F and 
N were carried through with some detail. The beginning of 
reaching as tested by our method was noticed in nearly every 
#*On seeing a candle the child puts out its hand; the second reaction 
(of withdrawal) is touched off by stimulation of the heat-pain nerves in the 
hand, and the moment at which this will happen depends on the sensitiveness 
of the heat-pain end-organs, and the openness of the path connecting them 
with the muscles that retract the arm; of which probably the openness of 
path is the modifiable factor. The warmth of the candle begins to stimulate 
this retraction reflex, and stimulates it more, and at an increasing rate of 
increase, as the hand approaches the candle. All that is needed to save 
the child from burning its hand, and this is what Meynert’s scheme aims 
to explain, is an openness of the retraction reflex path sufficient to stop the 
hand before it actually reaches the flame. If the act of extension excited 
through the eye is not too impetuous, the retraction reflex will from the out- 
set protect the hand; but if the former is a very open path, the advancing 
arm may get a momentum which the retraction reflex will not be sufficiently 
quick and strong to counterbalance in time to save the hand from being 
burned. A few repetitions of the experience will give retraction an openness 
which will safeguard the hand for the future; and this process is aided by 
the prolonged pain yielded by a burn, which continues the retraction stim- 
ulus for a considerable period and so ‘ wears’ down the retraction path more 
than a great many merely momentary stimuli could do. In this way a 
single experience of burning is often sufficient for all time. Thus experi- 
ence establishes a balance between the two opposed reflexes, of extension and 
af pain avoidance, such that the organism carries on its further examina- 
tion of the candle in safety.”—Holt, E. B. “The Freudian Wish.”

ease around the 120th to the 130th day. In poorly developed 
children it is apparently delayed. 
Formation of Habits in Adults.—The process of habit forma- 
tion in adults is marked off in several ways from that just studied 
in the infant. In the first place the muscles of the infant are 
poorly developed. The finer muscles of his moving members have 
not yet been codrdinated into habit systems of general utility, 
action is lacking in definiteness and sharpness. His learning to 
reach for the candy and to inhibit reaching for the candle are 
organizations which will not only serve in this particular situa- 
tion but also in nearly every other future habit he may form. 
There is some evidence to show that neuro-physiological growth 
processes are actually taking place since it is generally affirmed 
that the large movements of shoulder, elbow, wrist and hand come 
into prominence long before the finer movements of the fingers. 
We have gained some evidence for this in our study of the appo- 
sition of the thumb and first finger. This earlier development of 
the large muscles is taken into account in the primary grades in 
teaching children to write by employing large movements and 
then gradually progressing to the finer. Whether this is a jus- 
tifiable pedagogical procedure is questionable, since by the time 
they reach the writing age fine finger movements are undoubtedly 
possible: the child merely has to learn a double set of habits. It 
was shown early in the history of psychology that differential 
contact reactions are finer in the child than in the adult. This 
is due to the fact that the child has all of the afferent endings 
developed, and since his hand is smaller than that of the adult 
the endings lie nearer together. The same argument can be ad- 
vanced, of course, for the kinesthetic endings in the muscles. 
Here again, though, we enter into the realm of research rather 
than into that of established fact. 
In the adult many thousands of experiences like these we 
have just been considering have brought organization, and most. 
of the habits he has to learn employ in part at least the organiza- 
tion gained from previous habit formation. This in a way is his 
strength and at the same time also his weakness. Our habitual 
ways of exercising our muscles so fixes them that unusual or
-P-A-G-E-315
  EXPLICIT BODILY HABITS 303 
totally new modes of activity are acquired with greater difficulty 
than if our muscles were not set in such habitual molds. It is 
difficult for the man of thirty-five to learn to dive well or to use 
his wrist perfectly in lobbing a tennis ball; it is practically 
impossible for a woman to learn to be a ballet or toe dancer 
unless she began practicing at ten years of age or younger. We 
shall see later though when we come to consider the effects of age 
upon habit formation that the concept of the rigidity of the 
muscles of the middle-aged has been overrated. There unques- 
tionably are differences in the possibilities of acquisition of the 
adult and the adolescent, but we shall discuss this subject on 
page 388. 
In observing the 120-day infant we saw that instinctive fac- 
tors came into play as soon as it was faced by a situation to which 
it was not adjusted. In man in a similar situation, instead of 
the infantile random activity appearing, the habitual unitary 
activity previously learned appears. Suppose we try to teach him 
to play tennis. He grasps the racket accurately but possibly not 
at the right place. He swings it awkwardly enough, possibly 
as he would a baseball bat or a board—he does the thing which 
Me has in the past. most frequently done to objects of that type. 
(™m general, when put in new situations he tries first one old act 
and then another, When these fail to work, splitting and partial 
reactions appear. The situation may become an emotional one at 
any time, especially when his past organization fails to help him. 
He then falls back upon infantile types of reaction: he may 
throw the thing down, stamp on it, pull, twist and manipulate 
any part of it at random, finally breaking the object in his 
raging. Oceasionally, but rarely, the infantile reactions lead to 
the adjustment, since in emotional excitement a larger number 
of random acts is released than when the individual is working 
at an organized integrated level. Usually in adults the display 
of activity in new situations is, as we have mentioned, orderly. 
‘The adult attacks the simpler things first, combining them as 
he can, each combination making the succeeding step easier until 
finally the problem is solved. 
(Learning to Shoot with the English Long Bow.—The stages 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-316
304 PSYCHOLOGY 
can be illustrated by an experimental study on learning to shoot 
the English long bow (Lashley). The bow used for the study 
was six feet in length, requiring a pull of forty-four pounds to 
draw the arrow to the head. The arrow was the regulation 
feathered, steel-tipped, twenty-eight-inch arrow used in tourna- 
ment work. The target was four feet in diameter with a ten-inch 
bull’s-eye placed at a distance of one hundred and twenty feet. 
The subject was given the bow, told how to nock the arrow and 
only enough more to keep him from injuring himself and others. 
He had to learn how to adjust his fingers to the string and to the 
arrow, to get his stance, to raise the bow properly, to get the 
arrow aligned, to point the arrow up far enough to counteract 
its parabolic flight (sighting or aiming), to hold the bow with 
extreme steadiness, to release so as to get the full power of the 
string, to hold the bow so that the string after the arrow was 
released would not strike the wrist and finally to brace himself 
for the recoil. It would be impossible for us to trace these part 
adjustments through in detail. At first the shooting is very 
wild, so wild that only rarely is the target hit. A wide back- 
ground of cotton sheeting had to be placed behind the target in 
order to provide a method of marking the errors. The arrows 
at first are likely to fall short because of the difficulty in pulling 
the arrow back to the piling or in aiming too low. Yn counter- 
acting this the subject begins to shoot entirely too high. On 
account of the wobbling of his arrow he also shoots to the right 
and left as well as above and below. Little by little the part 
reactions begin to fall in place, the subject begins to hit the 
target and to come cleser and closer to the bull’s-eye. In one 
group studied, the average of the first 20 shots was 56.9 inches 
away from the bull’s-eye. The average of the last 20 shots when 
360 shots in all were given was 27.1 inches. While this shows 
considerable progress it is really very far away from the record 
of the expert. The championship score at the forty-yard range 
between 1890 and 1908 varied from about 8-11 inches from the 
bull’s-eye. One interesting thing appearing in this as in most 
/ habits is the fact that initial progress is quite rapid but that all 
later progress is slow. One might think at first sight that if a

beginner can change his score from 57 to 27 inches in 360 shots 
he ought to be able to drop to 11 inches after a few hundred more 
shots. But such is not the case. The 11-inch record is one which 
few individuals can ever attain no matter what amount of prac- 
tice they have had. In one exceptionally good subject we got a 
final record of 15 inches at the end of 1300 shots. This brings 
out the fact that in every act of skill there is what is called a INCHES. SSGRNBSHSESRSRIAS

physiological limit of accuracy or speed beyond which the indi- 
vidual cannot go. We find a good example of this in typewriting, 
where the individual rarely exceeds a sustained speed of over 64 
words per minute of straight copy. The same thing has been 
brought out in rifle shooting, billiards, golf, and in fact in every 
act of skill which has been investigated. 
Above we give a curve (Fig. 58) of acquisition of skill in 
archery. It shows the method of constructing charts and tabu- 
ee and the main features to be learned from such

a tabulation. The horizontal line, the abscissa, shows the amount 
of practice (number of shots) ; the vertical, the ordinate, shows 
the number of inches each shot was distant from the bull’s-eye. 
From such a curve one can determine the total amount of im- 
provement by subtracting the average of the first 20 shots from 
the average of the last 20 shots. In the curve under consideration 
the improvement was from 75.4 inches to 45.1 inches. One can 
also determine the rate of improvement between any two points, 
and finally the limit of improvement for the given amount of 
practice; for example, in this curve the subjects were finally 
shooting at an average of 45.1 inches. This learning curve is 
typical of most curves. Note (1) that initial accuracy was low, 
the average of the first 20 shots being 75.4 inches; (2) that im- 
provement through the first 60 shots was very rapid indeed, from 
an average of 75.4 to an average of 51.5 inches; (3) that during 
the next 80 shots there is little total improvement. These long 
periods of no improvement are called plateaux; shorter periods 
of no improvement are called resting places. It will be seen that 
the curve ends on another plateau, the last 40 or 50 shots show- 
ing a decrease in accuracy. Note (4) that just before the 200th 
shot has been taken a period of marked improvement occurs which 
continues with slight irregularity to the 320th shot, where the 
second plateau begins. From what we know of such curves we 
can be reasonably sure that after a longer or shorter time of 
no improvement the curve would again take a decided drop, since 
the limit of improvement had by no means been approached. If 
the practice had continued, for example, to the 5000th. shot the 
plotted curve would have been checked as the physiological limit 
for those particular individuals was approached. As soon as 
this limit was reached the curve would become, except for slight 
variations, a straight line. Certain individuals would find their 
limit probably at 15 inches and others at 12. It is, of course, 
possible even in as small a group as this (six) that an exceptional 
individual might be included. If so, a final record of 8 inches 
might have been attained. In Chapter X we shall discuss 
in detail a great many of the factors which affect the shape 
of such curves, the total amount and rate of improvement and  
-P-A-G-E-319

the limits of improvement. The permanence of the improve- 
ment for curves of this type is discussed in the present chapter 
(page 327). 
Single Adjustments and Partial Habits of Every-Day 
Life-—Only rarely in every-day life are acts of skill acquired 
in the systematic manner we have outlined. Our practice periods 
are sketchy, and are repeated only after long intervals. The 
best example of the ordinary way in which skill is attained in 
daily life is the behavior of an individual when he gets stuck on 
a problem. He solves the problem or leaves it, as the case may 
be, without mastering all the details. Possibly we can illustrate 
this by an actual example from motor-boating, which will fit the 
various automobile troubles fully as well. Suppose we take the 
following situation: The new gas engine in a motor-boat runs 
smoothly for a short time, then begins to miss and to lose power. 
Certain of the spark-plugs begin to heat up, and a valve or two 
sticks. The boat may run again smoothly for a mile or two, and 
then again get cranky. The owner stops the boat and looks at 
the engine, and undoubtedly ‘‘thinks’’ in the sense of acting with 
his language organization rather than with his hands. Previous 
seraps of reading and instruction are (kinesthetically) rein- 
stated, as for example: ‘‘when the engine misses, clean the spark- 
plugs.’’? This intra-organically aroused stimulus leads to the 
act of taking out the spark-plugs and cleaning them. That done 
he puts on his spark and starts the engine. Again the miss. 
That leads to his investigating the gas supply. It is sufficient. 
He runs the boat to the dock, takes the magneto apart and sand- 
papers the points for luck. Still the miss. He next cleans the 
earbureter and the feed-pipe. Not being successful, he opens 
up the engine and looks at the valves. They are now cool, and 
are working properly. This exhausts his own organization. He 
takes the boat to a local ‘‘expert.’’ The expert goes over every- 
thing in much the same way as the owner has already gone over 
it. He tells the owner that the engine is no good. The owner 
takes the boat back to the dock, his every act showing his de- 
pressed emotional level. At the dock he becomes infantile in 
his reactions, trying first one thing and then another, pushing
-P-A-G-E-320
  308 PSYCHOLOGY 
this part, pulling that, finally lying down exhausted. Night 
comes on and he leaves the boat to eat and sleep, coming back 
to it next morning in a better physiological condition. He starts 
the engine up slowly, leaning over it and watching the various 
parts as they work. He sees the heads of the bolts which fasten 
the engine to the bed moving up and down. Like a flash he 
stops his engine, tightens the four bolts and sails off to tell the 
engine expert that he is fit only to patch up holes in rowboats. 
Many of the mal-adjustments of the day are of this type. 
We have used thinking here in advance of our special study of 
that type of activity, but we mean only the language activity 
which corresponds in all respects to other kinds of organized 
motor activity. We pointed out earlier that the number of such 
language habits is far in excess of all others. Hence when stuck 
or in difficulty there is a constant shifting from overt language 
(talking to one’s self or to one’s companion) to implicit language 
(thought), and to overt activity in arms, hands and fingers. The 
words he has read or that others have spoken to him are rein- 
stated; they become in turn adequate stimuli for the arousal of 
overt activity. We thus see that overt activity constantly arouses 
the implicit and the latter in turn arouses the overt. All the way 
through the individual in our illustration has been acting con- 
stantly under the guidance of extra-organically or intra-organi- 
cally aroused stimuli or under both simultaneously. 
It may be objected that our illustration is not a habit. This 
is true in the sense that after making such an adjustment as the 
above we cannot immediately try the man out in a similar situa- 
tion. But our illustration does correspond, in some respects, to 
the first trial in our previous example of acquisition of skill in 
archery. Given enough similar situations and the owner could 
always spot a gas engine that is loose upon its bed. If we continue 
varying the situation, putting the trouble now in the valves, next 
in the magneto and then in order in the pump, piston rings and 
oiling system we could finally build up by this trial and error 
process such a series of specialized habits that given the sight 
or sound of an, improperly working engine he could at once dive 
to the troublesome part. We would have then the practically
-P-A-G-E-321
EXPLICIT BODILY HABITS 309 
trained expert gas engineer. But life is too short for us all to 
become experts in all of the activities in which we occasionally 
engage. We become Jacks-of-all-trades in lines other than those 
by means of which we earn our daily bread. The number of 
abbreviated habits possessed by any given individual in the differ- 
ent spheres of life, as in music, painting, drawing, lecturing and 
engineering, is very large indeed. 
Cross Education.—One of the interesting and significant 
things in connection with habit formation is the fact that when 
a habit is established which utilizes any particular organ of the 
body, for example, the right hand and arm, the bilaterally sym- 
metrical organ, the left hand and arm, shares in the training. 
The improvement does not seem to be confined wholly to the 
bilaterally symmetrical organ, since training the right toe to 
tap increases most markedly not only the ability of the left toe 
to tap, but also the improvement extends to the right hand 
and to the left hand. This phenomenon was noticed very early 
in sensory physiology (differential reaction to two contacts), but 
it has been more recently investigated by several psychologists. 
The method in brief is as follows: A measure of initial accuracy 
of a given function is tested in two symmetrical organs. One 
organ is then practiced until high skill is attained. The unused 
organ is then retested. The initial score made by this organ is 
compared with its later score and the difference in the two gives 
the measure of the amount of improvement (less, of course, the 
small practice effect gained by giving the original test). In this 
way it has been found that lunging at a target with a foil one 
hundred times with the right hand produced an improvement in 
the left hand about three-fourths as great as in the right (Davis). 
Woodworth has shown that practice with the left hand in hitting 
dots greatly improves the ability of the right hand in the same 
performance. Swift found that after training the right hand 
in tossing and catching balls the ability of the left hand improved. 
Starch found that when the right hand has been practiced in 
tracing the outline of a six-pointed star seen in a mirror the im- 
provement in the left hand was about nine-tenths as great as in 
the right hand.
-P-A-G-E-322
  310 PSYCHOLOGY 
Certain individuals have used these results as an argument 
in favor of a general transfer of training, a subject which we 
consider below. Although we do not know the various physi- 
ological factors involved in cross education there seems to be no 
justification for extending our conclusions beyond the facts that 
can actually be observed. 
The So-Called Transfer of Training.—The problems involved 
in the controversy as to whether training along any specific line 
produces a general transfer effect upon other lines are as old as 
are the school systems and older. The whole question at one or 
another time has centered around the problem as to whether 
training in the classics and in mathematies facilitates the acquisi- 
tion of all other subjects. The experimental literature is large 
and extremely controversial. The results of a few experiments 
only are given here. Thorndike and Woodworth trained their 
subjects in estimating weights of 40 to 120 grams. This practice 
produced only a slight improvement in the ability to react cor- 
rectly to weights ranging in weight from 120 to 1800 grams. 
Foster, working with adult students, each of whom spent 40 hours 
in practice distributed over 10 weeks, measured and analyzed 
the improvement in drawing objects, pictures and nonsense draw- 
ing. He concludes: ‘‘That training in these experiments has 
made the observers noticeably better observers or memorizers in 
general, or given them any habits of observing closely or report- 
ing correctly, or furnished any ability to meet better any situa- 
tion generally met with, neither we nor the observers themselves 
believe. . . . It seems, therefore, as if the value of formal 
training of our kind has been greatly overestimated.’’ Gilbert 
and Fracker tested two individuals for quickness in moving the 
fingers (1) to a sound stimulus, (2) to an electric shock, (3) 
when a blow was given, and (4) when a blue surface was shown. 
Under the conditions of the experiment, which we cannot enter 
into here, a spread of training seemed to be secured. Coover and 
Angell tested four adult subjects in typewriting before and after 
training in sorting cards, but their records show little gain which 
cannot be accounted for by the special improvement accruing 
from the practice in typewriting the test material.
-P-A-G-E-323
  EXPLICIT BODILY HABITS 311 
Most of the experiments have been carried out upon the im- 
provement in one language function due to the previous train- 
ing in another. The subject, for example, would be trained on 
learning ‘‘Paradise Lost’’ and then tested on his ability to learn 
the ‘‘Coming of Arthur,’’ or trained on learning nonsense syl- 
lables and tested upon the learning of ordinary words, or trained 
on learning poetry and tested on history. It is assumed, of 
course, in such experiments that a measure of the subject’s ability 
to learn the material upon which later he is to be tested has been 
obtained. In general it may be stated that students of experi- 
mental education are inclined to admit the fact that improve- 
ment in one function may bring about improvement in another 
function, but they maintain that there is no general transfer of 
training (there may be just the reverse) of the kind usually 
insisted upon. In acquiring skill in any one function part ad- 
justments are made, such as the contro! of the eye movements, 
formation of systematic habits of study, ways of looking up words 
in the dictionary, etc., which can be directly used in acquiring 
skill in certain other functions. These part adjustments have 
been called ‘‘identical elements’? by Woodworth and Thorndike. 
Where there are no identical elements in the two functions, 
training in one does not hasten the process of acquisition in 
the other. 
Increasing the Complexity of the Object Beyond the Point 
Where Adequate Reaction Can Be Made.—In a narrow sense 
this problem has been investigated in the laboratory by means of 
the tachistoscope. This is a device for exposing a series of words, 
figures or objects simultaneously for a period of time less than 
that of the reflex eye movement. The experimenter begins by 
exposing two letters, figures, words or numbers. If the subject 
ean name those correctly or write them down or draw them, the 
number of objects exposed is increased until his limit is reached. 
As might be expected, considering the way our word habits and 
other habits are formed, as many separate words can be reacted 
to correctly as isolated letters. In general, it has been’ found 
that no more than six items can be properly reacted to. The 
limit, as a rule, ranges between four and six. In hearing, a
-P-A-G-E-324
  312 PSYCHOLOGY 
practical test can be made by getting the subject to repeat a list 
of numerals given to him orally. The number of numerals pre- 
sented is increased to the point where errors (omissions, dis- 
placements, wrong numerals) begin to appear. In the case of 
normal adults 6-8 numerals can be correctly repeated ; in the case 
of children, defectives, and of certain psychopathic individuals 
this number cannot be attained. In, making any of these tests 
upon a sense organ the stimuli may be presented either simulta- 
neously or successively without materially changing the results. 
The contact sense may be tested by touching the body simul- 
taneously at several different places. The number of separate 
points stimulating the individual can be correctly enumerated 
if they are not in excess of six. 
Vv The Number of Habits Which Can Function Simul- 
taneously.—The inability of the subject to react adequately to 
a, stimulus which has more than a certain complexity leads us 
at once into the discussion as to the number of separate activities 
or habits which can be exercised simultaneously. The fact seems 
to be that in the broadest sense since the individual acts as a unit 
only one thing can be done at a time. There seems to be an obvious 
contradiction in fact in this statement. [It will be immediately 
remarked that women can knit, quilt or sew while engaging in a 
lively conversation. The answer to this is that the knitting and 
talking have been learned together and hence they form a part 
of an organized system. It is more difficult to talk and tele- 
graph or to talk and play the piano, yet this, too, can be done. 
It is extremely difficult to talk and typewrite at the same time, 
yet possibly if the activities were originally learned in that way 
it could be done. In making all of the finer codrdinations as in 
rifle shooting, expert balancing or trapeze work the final adjust- 
ment is always made without conversation. 
Such considerations lead almost at once into the field of auto- 
matic writing. So far as the principles in automatic writing are 
concerned, there is no theoretical difficulty in holding that they 
are closely similar to knitting and talking, although, of conrse, 
the reaction system as a whole is far more complicated. The 
process of double acquisition, or, better, double functioning, has
-P-A-G-E-325
  EXPLICIT BODILY HABITS 313 
been experimentally studied by Downey and Anderson. After 
considerable work they acquired some skill in the double process 
of writing a stanza previously memorized while maintaining 
either silent reading or reading aloud. Two years after acquir- 
ing this skill the function was retested. There was considerable 
retention with rapid re-learning. It is safe to say that on account 
of the effort and tremendous strain involved in simultaneous 
double acquisition such learning will never become popular. 
In psycho-pathology we find many examples of the indepen- 
dent exercise of part reactions, some of which become highly 
systematized. We see this systematization possibly in the so- 
called cases of ‘‘multiple personality’’ or ‘‘split personalities’’: 
nearly every human being has something in his organization both 
of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. If we assume that for one reason 
or another the more socialized reactions of Dr. Jekyll so come in 
conflict with one another that inhibition of reaction on that plane 
occurs, action will take place through the outlets which are not 
in conflict. If this goes on for a sufficient length of time there 
seems to be no reason, according to the general principles of 
habit formation, why the individual should not become organized 
upon the level of Mr. Hyde. (Indeed, if enough suggestions are 
given to the patient, he may systematize on two or three such 
levels.) If by the alteration of the individual’s environment or 
by his reéducation, the conflicts in the socialized reaction tend- 
encies of Dr. Jekyll are removed, we may once more see him 
reacting permanently as Dr. Jekyll. 
There is a purely practical question possibly involved in this 
discussion. For example, in the cotton mills of the South, chil- 
dren from fourteen years of age and on are taught to run one 
loom. As they grow older and become more adept in their work 
they are given more and more looms to manage. The adjust- 
ment required is fairly simple, but it involves great eye-strain 
and extreme nimbleness of movement. There are a number of 
duties in the electrical world which demand a similar type of 
adjustment. The question as to the possible number of such 
operations which can be carried out at one time is, of course, 
important. In the first place the larger the number of separate
-P-A-G-E-326
  314 PSYCHOLOGY 
operations the individual can conduct simultaneously and effi- 
ciently the greater is the advantage to the manufacturer, and to 
the employee if paid on a piece-work basis. On the other hand, 
it may be extremely detrimental to the organization of the indi- 
vidual himself. So far no investigations have been made which 
show just how many such operations can be carried out without 
loss in efficiency ; or whether the number can be increased by the 
adoption of special training methods; and finally whether the 
effect of such a splitting of activity is detrimental to the indi- 
vidual himself. 
Habit Fixation.—At the present time there is no satisfactory 
way of giving an account of the formation of a habit in terms of 
cause and effect. A good many monographs and special chapters 
have been devoted to its explanation, but although we know a 
great deal about the factors which influence the formation of 
habits, as we shall see later, we cannot state in detail what the 
course of events is in the inception of any individual habit. 
\Habits start, as we have seen, with the so-called random move- 
ments (if the object fails to arouse either positive or negative 
reaction tendencies no habit can be formed). Among those 
random movements is one group or combination which, completes 
the adjustment, the ‘‘suecessful’’ one. All others, from a super- 
ficial standpoint, seem to be unnecessary. But it must be remem- 
bered that the organism cannot respond in any other way than 
his equipment allows him to. When put in front of a problem 
the solution to which cannot be effected by an immediate instine- 
tive act or by one belonging to his past habit acquisitions, the 
whole organism begins to work in each and every part but with- 
out working together. Not only are the arms, legs and trunk 
active but the heart, stomach, lungs and glands as well. We 
know that when the new habit is formed the organism as a whole 
acts smoothly, each part reaction hangs together with every other 
part reaction, all tending to facilitate and make possible the 
smooth working of the group of acts effecting the final adjust- 
ment. The formation of the simplest habit is an enormously com- 
plicated affair. We are prone to think that the successful act is 
only a small group of movements involving, for example, only 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
  
EXPLICIT BODILY HABITS 315 
the hands and the fingers. This is not true. Even so apparently 
simple a thing as firing a rifle successfully requires many facil- 
itating part adjustments all over the body. As the right hand 
picks up the rifle the body parts begin to fall into line—a certain 
stance is taken so as to brace the body, the back muscles take on 
a greater tone, the left hand and arm begin to take on the posi- 
tion of grasping the end of the barrel, the shoulder muscles con- 
tract, finally the instant before firing respiration is blocked and as 
the trigger is pulled the body gets ready to withstand the recoil. 
The production of such a close-fitting and well-timed group 
of activities all working together, the end result being the hitting 
of the bull’s-eye or the felling of the deer, requires in the begin- 
ning naturally the display of a large number of ‘‘useless’” move- 
ments. But probably on each succeeding attempt to hit the bull’s- 
eye some of these part reactions fall together in such a way as to 
facilitate succeeding movements. The whole learning stage is 
thus an active one and something is gained each time the indi- 
vidual goes through the process. Hence the so-called useless 
movements are useless only when looked at from the standpoint 
of the completed habit. They are all necessary in view of the 
fact that the successful movements could not have appeared in 
any given trial unless they had been preceded by just those acts 
which did precede. 
Some attempted causal explanations of the process of fixa- 
tion are as follows: (1) In most cases where random activity 
finally leads to success the successful group of acts is always the 
last one to appear; hence when the next trial is given the last 
group active in the preceding test (the successful one) is thus 
the one most recently exercised, therefore, other things being 
equal, it will be the one most likely to occur first or at least early 
in the second trial. (2) In view of the fact that the random 
acts are infinitely varied the successful act is the only one per- 
formed each time the stimulus is presented. It, therefore, be- 
comes the most frequently performed movement. (3) By reason 
of the fact that the final group of acts always brings food, water, 
removes an irritating object, lessens emotional tension, etc., the 
new state (attained by the result of the action of the final group)

brings heightened metabolism. It is conceivable that those neuro- 
muscular elements which have just been active, in completing the 
adjustment have a slightly dilated system of blood-vessels, con- 
sequently they share more generously than the group functioning 
earlier in the increased and bettered blood supply. (4) It is 
possible that when the final group of movements functions and 
the adjustment is completed, the situation as a whole becomes 
an emotion-producing one; internal glandular secretions are set 
free which serve as reinforcers. It is possible to suppose, due to 
the increased dilatation of the blood-vessels in the elements which 
have just functioned, that they receive a slightly greater ‘‘rein- 
forcement’’ (possibly increase in metabolic rate as a result of 
the increased blood flow to the parts in active use) from the auta- 
eoid agencies than the groups which functioned earlier. One 
pictures here, of course, the possible action of adrenin in neu- 
tralizing fatigue products. It should again be emphasized that 
these are little more than mere speculations. The fact, however, 
that we must confess to no ready-made explanation of this prob- 
lem should detract in no way from our zeal in studying the other 
factors involved in habit formation. 
Neural Basis of Habit—Man is principally a visual and 
Aural animal so far as the acquisition of habits is concerned. We 
\¥ mean by this that these two sense organs initiate the majority 
of the impulses to which he reacts in a motor way during the 
acquisition stage of all habit. This is far from saying that the 
other sense organs are not utilized in the same way or that they 
may not be. Certainly the contact and the kinesthetic senses 
are important factors in every habit even in the initial stages. 
Nevertheless, the human animal, if left alone, brings vision to 
bear wherever possible in forming a habit. When considered 
purely schematically the relationships involved are quite simple. 
Watch any adult try to use a visible typewriter for the first time. 
Give him the printed word CAT. He looks over the keyboard and 
as soon as OC stimulates the eye he strikes the key and looks at 
the result. He looks back at the copy, repeating the procedure 
until each letter is written. The activity is initiated at every 
step by vision. Some activities are necessarily always largely
-P-A-G-E-329
  EXPLICIT BODILY HABITS 317 
executed in the terms in which they were learned, but most acts, 
regardless of the sense organ used in acquisition, tend as time 
goes on to approach the kinesthetic stage. An accomplished 
piano player rarely looks at his instrument. The ‘‘touch’’ ste- 
nographer never looks at the keys but only at the copy. Her 
hands literally run themselves (practically segmental reflexes) 
unless a breakdown occurs. The moment the wrong letter is 
struck the chain as a whole is broken and visual-motor adjust- 
ment takes place. On page 58 we called attention to the fact 
that every muscle is both-a sense organ and a motor organ. The 
facts we studied there will explain how activities of great com- 
plexity can be executed wholly or largely in motor terms. Con- 
sider the following purely schematic illustration. Let A, B, C, 
D, E, F, ete., represent a series of visual objects to each of which 
we respond with a given group of movements; movements 1 to A, 
movements 2 to B, movements 3 to C, ete. If the series of re- 
sponses is learned in an invariable way, the individual after a 
time gets to the point. where only the first member of the visual 
series is necessary to produce the responses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ete., in 
their proper order.t| How does this come about? What change 
has there been in the system? When visual stimulus A is pre- 
sented movement 1 occurs. But when response 1 is made there 
arises a kinesthetic impulse. This kinesthetic impulse has been 
associated so long with the visual impulse B that it can rouse 
movement 2 without the visual object B actually striking the eye 
(substitution of stimulus). Similarly, movements in muscle 2 
arouses the kinesthetic impulse which throws muscle 3 into activ- 
ity. We have outlined the matter so far witk respect to normal 
individuals. The acquisition of habits in defectives of the blind 
deaf-mute type is very different. Cutaneous impulses take the 
place of vision and audition during the process of acquisition. 
This principle which we have so briefly discussed is one of the 
most important in the whole of psychology. By means of im- 
  
*The so-called touch methods of teaching typewriting abbreviate learn- 
ing apparently from the start. Contact and kinesthesis take care of the 
movements from the beginning of learning, and the eyes are left free to 
follow thé copy. There is no loss in time due to shifting the eyes from copy 
the keys and vice versa.
-P-A-G-E-330
  318 PSYCHOLOGY 
pulses from the muscles themselves man becomes partially inde- 
pendent of the impulses from the so-called higher senses. We 
see the advantage of this when we have to act in the dark or 
when we actually lose the use of one of the higher senses. We see 
the final perfection of the process in thought where we have a 
substituted word process for practically every object in our 
environment. These substituted word processes can initiate gen- 
eral bodily movements exactly as do the visual or auditory stimuli 
for which they stand. 
Possible Short-Circuiting in the Central Nervous Sys- 
tem.—The question arises, of course, as to whether there is a sim- 
ilar short-cireuiting process in the central nervous system, 
whether the cortex is involved in both the acquisition and the 
performance stage of habit. It is conceivable, of course, that the 
cortex is involved in the acquisition stage, but that as training 
goes on the lower centers may short-circuit the process. We can- 
not answer this question definitely at the present time. It is cer- 
tainly generally assumed that in the acquisition of a habit the 
so-called sensory (and motor) areas in the cortex are involved, 
and further that those parts of the brain’ must remain intact if 
the habit is to exist undisturbed. For example, it is assumed 
that in a visual-motor habit the visual and motor areas in the 
cortex must be intact, that in an auditory-motor habit the audi- 
tory and motor areas must be without lesion. From some work 
which Franz and Lashley are doing we are called upon to modify 
to some extent this general view. Franz has shown that in indi- 
viduals of the aphasic and paralytic types with serious destruc- 
tion of nervous (brain) tissue a fairly respectable group of habits 
may be built up—the subjects can be taught to speak, to knit and 
sew and to play baseball. This is true even though their speech 
and motor habits may have been lost for years. Lashley and 
Franz, working upon the formation of habit in the rat, present 
the view that one-third of any portion of the cortex as a whole 
(motor area excluded) can be destroyed without interfering seri- 
ously with the animal’s ability to form habits. If large portions 
of the cortex are destroyed after the habit is formed, far less 
serious disturbance is caused than we have been led to believe
-P-A-G-E-331
EXPLICIT BODILY HABITS 319 
hitherto. This view is indicated in the earlier work of Franz on 
the frontal cerebral lobe of cats and monkeys which was later 
confirmed by Swift. Franz observed that if parts of the frontal 
lobes of an animal (cat) that had acquired a habit were extir- 
pated this previously learned habit was lost, but that the animal 
could re-acquire this habit and learn new ones. While these facts 
tend to disprove the early strict views of cortical localization, 
teaching rather that the brain as a whole is more adaptable than 
we have believed and that each part is tolerant of a varied type 
of function, it should not be assumed that the cortex is useless or 
that its functions are not less important than we had hitherto 
been led to believe: nor is it possible to conclude from such work 
that the cortex has the same function over the whole cerebral 
hemisphere or that. the whole fabrie of cortical localization has 
been destroyed. We know beyond question that the precentral 
gyrus is mainly responsible for the cerebral control of motor 
functions, and that in man at least the cortical representations 
of the sense organs (sensory areas) cannot be too seriously tam- 
pered with without bringing grave trouble to the habits which 
have previously been formed. Our interest here in the problem 
centers around the possibility of reéstablishing certain basal 
habits connected with the care of the person (eating, drinking, 
talking), and those connected with simple occupations in indi- 
viduals who have suffered grave cortical lesion. A few years ago 
the thought of retraining a paralytic of long standing would not 
have been seriously entertained. 
The Determiners of Acts.—In adult life each single object or 
situation can call out more than one response. The sight of a 
dog can cause me to run and climb a tree or to whistle for it to 
come and be petted. Likewise, the sight of this animal may 
lead me to go and get food for it, or to muzzle it, or to get my 
gun and go shooting. The more highly educated the man the 
larger the number of responses any object can call out. When 
explicit and implicit vocal responses are considered we can gather 
some idea of the enormous number of reactions that center around 
each situation and object. It is this possibility of multiple re- 
sponse to 4 single stimulus that makes man’s reactions hard to 
predict in a particular instance. These habits are flexible in 
 
-P-A-G-E-332
320 PSYCHOLOGY 
the sense that man is prepared to meet any slight change in the 
situation or object with an appropriate change in the response. 
The constant shifting of response is seen to best advantage in 
the verbal parrying and fencing of two men in argument, in 
the airy persifiage of a conversational kind that goes on between 
a witty man and woman, or in the encounters between two wrest- 
lers, fencers, or boxers. So varied is the shading of response that 
habit seems at first sight to be a poorly chosen term to apply 
to it. But we neglect the long years of training the individual 
must gc through with before such varied activity can take place. 
If we could watch the growth of such conduct we should see that 
its development is gradual and orderly. In view of the fact that 
there are so many responses possible, the question as to which 
will appear upon the incidence of a given stimulus becomes one 
which we must consider. We can answer this only in a general 
way and in probable terms. (1) The response most likely to 
appear is the one which was most recently called out by the 
object. (2) When recency is not pertinent the act which has 
been most frequently connected with the object is the one most 
likely to be called out. (3) The act called out is likely to be one 
which is most closely connected with the general setting of the 
situation as a whole. For example, one taking an ocean voyage 
with agreeable men and women companions might begin to hop 
about and dance at the sight of a man with a violin. But if 
earlier in the morning several conventional ladies had remarked 
that ‘‘to-day is Sunday, no dancing will be tolerated,’”’ the sight 
of the man with the violin, may lead merely to verbal railing 
against the blue laws enforced beyond the three-mile limit. We 
are expected to display churchly behavior, funereal behavior and 
wedding behavior upon certain occasions. The situation as a 
whole envelops us and each object in that situation can call 
out for the time being only a narrowly appropriate and conven- 
tional type of act: (4) The most important determiners are the 
situations which the individual has had to come up against during 
the hours preceding the incidence of the stimulus to which he 
must now react, and the amount of emotional tension those pre- 
vious activities have aroused. The usual reactions to’a revolver 
lying on the dresser are possibly to polish and clean it periodi-
-P-A-G-E-333
  
EXPLICIT BODILY HABITS 321 
cally, but if some one has been rifling your cash drawer or safe 
from day to day you may, on reaching home, pick up the weapon, 
load it, return to your office and lie in wait for the intruder. (5) 
Temporary intra-organie factors tremendously influence our re- 
actions. The onset of toothache, headache, or indigestion or the 
beginning of seasickness may temporarily make out of an ordi- 
narily cheerful individual one from whom normal reactions can- 
not be obtained. (6) The most important determiner, of course, 
is the life history of the individual in the sense that his general 
| and special training, illnesses, disappointments, hobbies, family 
“training and the like develop within him definite attitudes, 
trends, or slants—to the religious man each new discovery in 
science is a direct evidence of the beneficence of the Creator; to 
the scientific man it is an evidence of the keenness and assiduity 
of the research worker; to the down-trodden each new thing 
is an added burden which will merely serve to overtax him 
further. 
We thus see that although the possibility of varied response 
is almost unlimited, yet definite factors are always present which 
rationalize behavior and give it a causal basis. In the normal 
individual these factors are so powerfully operative that no other 
line of conduct at the moment is open to him as long as he remains 
balanced: it is all but impossible for a balanced human being 
to be so torn by circumstances that he will throw a brick into his 
neighbor’s window, steal his purse or automobile or kidnap his 
child. It is alike impossible for him to commit suicide or mutilate 
himself or others. All of these acts are possible to him in the 
sense that the necessary codrdinations used in committing such 
crimes are in his repertoire. Yet his total systems of responses 
are so tied together that the moment he starts to perpetrate any 
one of them a new situation is created which immediately leads 
to a different act. Psychologically the individual can act only in 
line with his training and in conformity with his inherited points 
of weakness and strength. (We would recall here such factors 
as constitutional inferiority occurring from many causes but seen 
most frequently in the offspring of alcoholic, syphilitic and 
feeble-minded parents.)

B. RerEention or ‘‘Memory’’ or Expuicir Bopiuy Hasirs. 
Introduction—The term ‘‘memory’’ in psychology, when 
properly defined, is useful, and can be made to cover a wide 
series of facts. Take the case of explicit motor habits such as we 
are now considering. An individual may learn after a short 
but varying number of hours of practice to write on the type- 
writer thirty words of ordinary copy per minute; to send ten 
words by wireless per minute; or to play eighteen holes of golf 
in eighteen strokes above bogey. The learner then stops practice 
for a period of time, either for experimental reasons, or because 
his environment changes. At the end of that time he again begins 
to practice. The original learning score is kept and compared 
with the new score now being obtained. It is found that the last 
score in the original series (or average of the last several scores) 
is higher than the present initial score (or average of the first 
several scores). There has been a certain loss in the efficiency 
of the function. We might divide all such acquisitions which 
are allowed to lie fallow, and are then re-learned, into three 
periods: (1) the learning period (original acquisition), (2) the 
no-practice period (the interval during which the habit was laid 
aside), and. (3) the re-learning period. The learning period we 
have already discussed. The last two stages (but occasionally 
also the first or learning stage) are usually discussed under the 
term memory, although the reason for discussing the second or no- 
practice period under that heading arises from the misconcep- 
tion that in that stage something mysterious goes on in the ner- 
vous system—that there is a process of maturation taking place, 
expression of which is found in such a popular statement as ‘‘we 
learn to skate in summer and to swim in winter.’’ 
What Does Go'Onin Periods of no Practice?—Apparently 
two things may happen. (1) The more probable thing is that 
the various muscular and glandular combinations—the part ad- 
justments in the habit as a whole—begin to function in new 
habit systems. The adjustment of muscular and glandular ele- 
ments for specific duties does not stay put like the parts of an 
inorganic machine. They stay put and function together only 
so long as the situation allows a reasonable amount of exercise in 
 
-P-A-G-E-335
  
EXPLICIT BODILY HABITS 323 
those specific functions. As soon as the environment changes, 
so that a given habit cannot be utilized, other habits are put on, 
and the organism is to a certain extent made over. In the process 
of making over, certain groups of part activities combined to 
form the given habit are reincorporated into a new whole. 
Hence, when the organism is confronted with the old situation 
the old reaction, while it appears, shows a certain loss in speed 
and accuracy. In other words, an actual re-learning comparable 
in all respects to the original acquisition save in that of the total 
amount of time required, must ensue before the same facility 
in response can be obtained. (2) Oftentimes it happens that in 
the latter part of the original learning period the subject be- 
comes ‘‘stale’’? and gives up practice before his physiological 
limit of skill has been attained. This staleness may be due to one 
of several things: (a) trying to practice at too fast a rate or 
under pressure of various kinds: (b) attempting to acquire the 
habit through a poor distribution of time, that is, the learner 
practices too long periods and too frequently (page 405); (c) 
the practice periods utilize so much time that other habit systems 
have to be thwarted, as happens, for example, when skill is 
sought rapidly in any particular line: the individual has no 
time to play, to engage in social functions, to eat and sleep prop- 
erly, or to adjust his home or business affairs. We may group 
the results of the effect of all such factors under the term staleness. 
It may be said that staleness is not an idle concept or hypothetical 
one. It may be seen to perfection in the training for athletic con- 
tests. Many a championship game has been lost by staleness. It was 
such a common phenomenon in the air service during the period 
of most active training in the recent war that special officers 
were set aside to cope with the problem.® If the learner stops 
5Tt must be said that the choice of the kind of officers set aside for 
this purpose was most curious. They were called flight surgeons, and the 
personnel was composed most largely of otologists. Others composing the 
group were obstetricians and gynecologists. Just why this particular assort- 
ment of physicians was set aside for this particular purpose must be buried 
in the archives of the Air Medical Service at Washington. The most reason- 
able selection of men for this purpose would have been, in our opinion, 
psychopathologists working in conjunction with psychologists, who under- 
stand the laws connected with the formation and functioning of habit.  
-P-A-G-E-336
  
  324 PSYCHOLOGY 
during a period of staleness and has the opportunity of exercising 
his normal tendencies it may very well, and sometimes does, hap- 
pen that the no-practice period proves beneficial, even though 
the first score in relearning is not so high as the final score in 
the original learning (it rarely or never is). Cleveland in his 
study of chess-playing has brought this out very well. The 
learner when he begins re-learning has become another individ- 
ual; he comes back to his task at a higher emotional level, with 
a reserve strength, with a release from the pressure of thwarted 
tendencies and set for work. After the first two or three practice 
periods he may shoot far ahead of any score that he had pre- 
viously made in the original learning. 
Other Connotations of Memory.—Memory as ordinarily 
used in psychology covers a much larger field than is indicated in 
our discussion. In the first place it is sometimes used in testing 
work (page 43) as being co-extensive with organization in gen- 
eral. In testing defective and psychopathic individuals the abil- 
ity to-read is tried out, the ability to repeat or write the salient 
and important features of a story that is read to them: impor- 
tant dates in history are asked for, as well as the location of im- 
portant geographical places; their age and date of birth are asked 
for, the number of children in the family and the like. Such 
tests while they involve memory in the sense in which we use the 
term are really random samplings of the patient’s general organ- 
ization. There is no lack of harmony between the use of memory 
and our own. Memory as we narrowly study it in the laboratory 
deals usually with a single function in detail and it is presup- 
posed that we have before us the score made in the original 
learning, the time consumed in learning and the length of time 
the function was not exercised, and the re-learning score. When 
we make random sampling tests on an individual’s organization 
we, of course, have no such data at hand nor do we particularly 
care to have it: our interest in testing patients centers around the 
location of their defects in organization and equipment. These 
data give us a picture more or less complete of the general nature 
of the types of defects, their number and gravity. In other 
words, it is a part of the diagnosis. Until it is obtained the 
patient or defective cannot be intelligently looked after. 
 
-P-A-G-E-337
  
EXPLICIT BODILY HABITS 325 
For some reason the term memory has become tied up closely 
with the reinstatement of language activities and especially with 
the implicit word processes. Both psychological and popular 
language use the terms ‘‘recollection,’’ ‘‘recall,’’ ‘‘recognition”’ 
and a host of similar terms to express facts which one can see 
with such clearness and definiteness in the explicit habits after 
a period of no practice. Indeed, in the literature of psychology 
one finds such narrow functions abstracted, set apart and so mag- 
nified that the non-technical student begins to feel that the whole 
of psychology is little more than a discussion of such factors. 
We should be prepared to see by this time that the isolation and 
magnification of any particular function is wholly out of keep- 
ing with a psychology which deals with the adjustment of man 
as a whole to his environment. 
The Behaviorist’s Definition of Memory.—Memory, then, in 
our sense is a general term to express the fact that after a period 
‘of no practice in certain habits—explicit bodily habits, explicit 
word habits, implicit word habits—the function is not lost but is 
retained as a part of the individual’s organization, although it 
may, through disuse, have suffered greater or less impairment. 
After a period of no practice, given the old stimulus or situation 
A) the old reaction rises definitely and sharply ; or (2) it rises but 
with undesirable additions (errors) ; or (3) it rises (if at all) 
with so great. impairment that little organization can be noted— 
re-learning is as difficult as learning. This formulation of mem- 
ory fits such explicit habits or functions as hewing a line with an 
axe or chopping down trees or tennis playing or swimming; such 
combined explicit and implicit activity as receiving telegraphic 
messages or typewriting or taking dictation or saying aloud an old 
poem learned in childhood; such pure implicit habits as are seen 
in subvocal (‘‘mental’’) arithmetic or speaking a series of nonsense 
syllables learned by repeated silent readings twenty-four hours 
before; or such as those seen finally in naming’ an object, person, 
place or date after a long interval of time. In the last case men- 
tioned in order to avoid being misunderstood we hasten to add 
that memory is not always evidenced by naming or giving ex- 
pression to a word; often a person confronts us whom we have
-P-A-G-E-338
  326 PSYCHOLOGY 
not seen for some time; the stimulus of his face and figure is not 
sufficient to call out his name, but it does suffice to reinstate our 
old attitude toward him and possibly many of our other old reac- 
tions. We may walk with him and talk with him for some minutes 
before speaking his name. Not until voice, gesture and old situa- 
tions reinforce one another are all of the old reactions called out. 
We become integrated then with respect to this individual, the 
final group of activities being the words, ‘‘ Why, of course, John 
Smith! “We used to play baseball together at Jonesville High 
School.’’ Exactly the same phenomena appear when after a 
three-year period of disuse we try to use a complicated camera. 
We are stuck for a moment on the use of the trip which releases 
the shutter, or the mechanism for changing from time to instan- 
taneous work, but two or three minutes of manipulation make 
us letter-perfect in the use of the camera. Just so the ‘‘forgot- 
ten’’ name, only in that case our manipulation is vocal. We 
manipulate vocally by running over the names beginning with 
each succeeding letter of the alphabet, or by saying ‘‘black hair,’’ 
“blue eyes,’’ ‘‘six feet. tall,’’ and the like. 
Some Results of Experiments.—Possibly some of the factors 
we have been investigating may be better understood if we take 
up the results of experiments of laboratory studies upon the 
memory of skillful acts. W. F. Book has brought out some inter- 
esting and rather startling results. This investigator taught a 
number of subjects to typewrite by both the sight and touch 
methods. Instead of giving his results in number of words writ- 
ten per minute, he gave them in number of strokes made per 
minute, since he had the typewriter connected up with a series 
of levers in such a way that he could record such things as 
striking the spacer and moving the carriage. The subjects were 
brought to a respectable speed, and then were given no practice 
for considerable intervals. The record of one subject is given 
in some detail below: 
The last regular practice period yielded 1503 strokes in ten 
minutes. The machine was not touched again for 135 days. The 
first practice in re-learning (memory test) yielded 1365 strokes. 
The typewriter was not touched again for approximately a full 
 
-P-A-G-E-339
  
EXPLICIT BODILY HABITS 327 
year. After this second period of no practice the first re-learning 
test yielded 1390 strokes. We see that while there was a slight 
loss it was exceedingly small. 
Usually in making such tests the daily average of the last 
several days in the learning period is compared with the aver- 
ages of the first several days in the re-learning period. The fol- 
lowing table presents these data:

If one contrasts the average number of strokes during the last 
ten practices in learning, 1508, with the average of the ten in 
the second memory test, 1611, it would appear that instead of 
a loss there has been an actual gain. Indeed, Book has made 
this kind of comparison and has advanced the conclusion that, 
since there is no memory loss, something must go on in the non- 
practice periods in the way of establishing codrdinations. We 
quote his own conclusions: 
The increase in score shown by our second memory series 
was due, so far as we could make out, rather to the disappearance, 
with the lapse of time, of numerous psycho-physical difficulties, 
interfering associations, bad habits of attention, incidentally ac- 
quired in the course of learning, interfering habits and tendencies, 
which, as they fade, left the more firmly established typewriting 
associations free to act. (Italics in the text.) 
In general, since the so-called ‘‘useful’’ acts in the acquisi- 
tion of any total act of skill are exercised more frequently as a 
rule than the useless, there is no theoretical impossibility in 
accepting the conclusions of Book, but he really has no con- 
elusive supporting facts to offer. The curve of the original 
learning is not reproduced here, but the fact is that he stopped 
practicing on a spurt. Had he taken records for ten more days 
his average would probably have been around 1700 strokes per
-P-A-G-E-340
328 PSYCHOLOGY 
ten minutes instead of 1503. Furthermore, the practice gained 
from the ten days in June, 1906, was not without marked effect 
upon the succeeding and final memory tests. Hence, it seems 
that we need only to conclude that there is a tremendously great 
and surprising permanence in the functioning of the typewriting 
habit, but nothing supernatural in character. 
Other investigators find a high degree of permanency, but 
none that corresponds with that described above. For example, 
Rejall increased his skill to such a point that he could write at 
the rate of 25 words per minute with four errors per hundred 
words copied. After an interval of three and a half years of no 
practice, he scored in the first five days 18.75 words per minute 
with eight errors per 100 words, 18.9 with seven and a third 
errors, 21 with six and two-thirds errors, 22.1 with five errors, 
and 22.5 with eight and two-thirds errors. In terms of total 
amount of practice, 30 hours were (originally) required to write 
25 words a minute, with 4 errors per 100 words copied. Five 
hours of re-learning three and a half years later gave him 
approximately the same degree of skill. 
Swift taught his subjects to use one hand in tossing and 
catching two balls, one ball being caught and thrown while the 
other was in the air. The number of catches made before a miss 
occurred gave him a method of scoring, a day’s practice consist- 
ing in allowing a subject to work until ten misses occurred. Sub- 
ject ‘‘A’’ began with a score of 4, and in the last six days of 
42 days of practice attained average scores of 50, 82, 92, 88, 68 
and 105. He was afterwards tested once every thirty days for 
five months. He attained averages on the five monthly prac- 
tices respectively of 70, 80, 140, 110, 120. The subject was not 
retested until the end of 481 days, at which time he attained an 
average score of 119. He was not again tested until after a period 
of over four years with no practice. There was a considerable 
loss. He attained an average score of 5 in ten trials the first 
day and on successive following days his average scores were 
10, 18, 20, 26, 35, 66, 60, 45, 100, 160. ‘‘ Eleven days were required 
to regain the skill which had required 42 days of practice.’’ 
It is thus seen that the rate of deterioration in habits such
-P-A-G-E-341
EXPLICIT BODILY HABI18 329 
as we have considered, while in all cases positive, is very slow 
indeed. Ordinary observations show that the same is true in 
regard to swimming, skating, dancing, tennis-playing and skilled 
mechanical work. We shall see on page 863 that this is in marked 
contrast to the rapid deterioration observed in habits which 
belong primarily in the language groups. There the deteriora- 
tion is so rapid that in some cases, for example, in the learning 
of a series of nonsense syllables, the organization is lost in from 
fifteen minutes to half an hour so far as concerns the subject’s 
ability to speak or write the words. 
General Summary of Explicit Habits—The material we 
have presented in this chapter shows when we consider the 
formation of first habits in infants (1) that when the infant is 
put in a situation to which it is not adjusted, it displays its’rep- 
ertoire of instinctive and reflex movements) By a process which 
we have considered, the groups of movements necessary to bring 
about the adjustment finally become connected or associated. 
Each time the situation is presented after this stage is reached 
only the movements necessary to bring about the adjustment 
appear. A habit has been formed. We saw further (2) that when 
we confront-the adult with a situation to which he is not adjusted, 
he displays not the infantile, instinctive movements, but those 
gained from past habit organization. )These larger groups in the 
case of the adult are combined into a new whole apparently by the 
same process operative in the combination of the infantile instinc- 
tive and reflex movements. We have found (3) that the memory 
for explicit habits remains fairly accurate over a considerable 
stretch of time, and what loss there is can be compensated for 
after a short period of practice. 
One cannot overestimate the importance of the system of 
explicit bodily habits. On account of their definiteness and per- 
manence they become part of man’s total organization, and are 
as essential to him as structural parts. One might contrast our 
habit systems with the development of a modern factory. A hun- 
dred years ago the factory for making shoes consisted largely of 
an old tanbark mill driven by horses and a series of vats dug in 
the ground filled with water and ground tanbark for curing the
-P-A-G-E-342
  330 ca PSYCHOLOGY 
hides... The equipment and personnel consisted further of a 
few wooden forms, iron lasts, needles, sewing-thread, knives and 
the shoemaker and his helper. As time went on machines were 
built for every separate operation in the making of a shoe, 
so that now the article is hardly touched by hand. The human 
being cannot develop new hands, muscles, glands and fingers to 
keep pace with civilization, but each new demand made upon him 
should find him still plastic and still capable of forming the 
habits necessary to enable him to meet it. 
In the following chapter, as has been mentioned, we shall 
consider the formation and retention of both explicit and implicit 
language habits and the memory of these. It should be stated in 
advance that this separation is made purely in the interests of 
ease and clearness of presentation. {The explicit and implicit 
language habits are formed along with the explicit bodily habits 
and are bound up with them and become a part of every total 
unitary action system that the human organism forms. They 
are present in the simplest types of adjustment that he makes, 
but it is obvious that if we desire to make a separation for 
purposes of presentation we can easily do so. We can see the 
functioning of language habits only slightly in certain activities, 
as, for example, in swimming, tapping on the table with 
a pencil, while in certain other types they form an integral 
part and seem to be as important as arm and hand movement, 
for example, in typewriting, sending and receiving telegraphic 
messages. Finally in certain other functions explicit activity 
seems to drop out almost entirely, as, for example, in subvocal 
arithmetic. There the explicit factors show only as excess move- 
ments such as wrinkling the brow, closing the eyes and rubbing 
the forehead, until the final link in the chain is reached and the 
answer is written down with the hand. This type of implicit 
(largely word) adjustment culminates in thinking, where an 
individual may sit for hours. with practically no overt move- 
ment, finally announcing, ‘‘I have decided to give up university 
work and enter commercial life.’’

CHAPTER IX 
THE GENESIS AND RETENTION OF EXPLICIT AND 
IMPLICIT LANGUAGE HABITS 
Introduction—In many of the preceding chapters we have 
made reference to explicit and implicit language habits. It re- 
mains now to examine these functions separately and with some 
care. Until language activity has been studied and connected 
up with the other functions we have by no means given a full 
account of how the human animal performs its various tasks. 
Man is a social being and almost from birth language activity 
becomes a part of his every adjustment even though that adjust- 
ment be made to other than a social situation. Our previous 
study of instinct, emotion and habit cannot be considered com- 
plete until we have given language its due place among those 
activities. The subject of explicit and implicit language pro- 
cesses and of other implicit but non-language processes connected 
with thinking is so vast and can be approached from so many 
angles and points of view that we can give only an extremely 
meagre account of its main features. 
The Anatomical Basis of Language.—Throughout the text 
we have spoken of laryngeal processes as though they were re- 
sponsible for all language organization. This manner of speaking 
was chosen for brevity’s sake. We hasten to add now that the 
anatomical basis of language habits involves, of course, the whole 
body but specifically the neuro-muscular system in the head, 
neck and chest segments. A little consideration will show that 
the following parts codperate in every spoken word: the dia- 
phragm, lungs and muscles of the thorax; the extrinsic and in- 
trinsic muscles of the larynx; the muscles of the pharynx, nose 
and palate; the cheeks, tongue and lips. The larynx as such 
when considered merely as a mechanism for controlling’ the vocal, 
cords is the least important part of the system. It is quite impor- 
tant, of course, as a means of speaking aloud, but relatively 
unimportant from the standpoint of the functioning of the indi-

reactionary since we have seemingly laid so much stress upon 
the larynx, but we shall soon see that the glottis with its vocal 
cords may be removed without seriously affecting the subject’s 
ability to use whispered words. 
Brief Description of the Larynx and Neighboring Parts.— 
The anatomy of the neck and upper thorax regions is the most 
complicated of the whole body. Fig. 59 shows the cavity of the 
mouth and pharynx with related structures. Attention is called 
in this figure to the mouth region proper,. including the lips, 
cheeks, tongue, gums, teeth and hard palate; to the pharynx, the 
nasal portion of which is separated from the mouth region by the 
overhanging soft palate and uvula. The pharynx extends up- 
ward to the base of the skull, receiving the posterior opening of 
the nasal passages and downward to the cesophagus, at which 
level one finds the larynx. We can divide the pharynx into three 
parts, nasal, oral and laryngeal. The larynx itself is easy to 
locate in the male by the presence of the Adam’s apple (Fig. 60). 
This prominent structure is the thyroid cartilage, consisting of 
two plates which in the male join at an angle of 90 degrees, in 
the female at 120 degrees. The larynx is suspended from the 
tongue and the hyoid bone. Its framework consists of three sym- 
metrical cartilages (thyroid, cricoid and cartilage of the epiglot- 
tis) and three paired cartilages (arytenoid, corniculate and 
cuneiform). Special attention is called to the cartilage of 
the epiglottis, which is placed in front of the superior opening of 
the larynx, projecting downward behind the base of the tongue. 
The epiglottis assists in closing the laryngeal opening during the 
act of swallowing. Until puberty the larynx is smooth, slight and 
similar in the male and female. In the female this condition 
persists, but in the male profound changes occur around the 
thirteenth year. The larynx becomes prominent, due to the en- 
largement and thickening of the cartilages. The vocal ligaments 
likewise become lengthened, thus making a deeper voice possible. 
The vertical diameter, that is the distance from the upper border 
of the thyroid cartilage to the lower border of the ericoid, is 
4.8 em. in males, 3.8 em. in females. The transverse diameter is
-P-A-G-E-347

nearly the same, 4.3 em. in males and 4.1 cm. in females, The 
anterior-posterior diameter is 3.6 cm. in males and 2.6 em. in 
females. The cavity of the larynx opens upward through the 
vocal cords into the trachea. The trachea bifurcates into the

It is impossible to enter into the separate action of these 
muscles by means of which the larynx as a whole is raised or 
lowered and the vocal cords tightened or relaxed. The whole 
subject of laryngeal and allied action has developed into the 
science of phonetics to which anatomy, physiology, medicine, 
physics and psychology contribute. 
The Production of Laryngeal Sounds.—In general it may be 
said that (1) the membranous glottis with the vocal cords is 
the exclusive seat of voice production. Removal of the cords 
renders the production of overt speech impossible; (2) the vibra- 
tion of the air produced by the vocal cords starts in the glottis 
and is transmitted to the air lying above and below, to the chest

cavity on the one hand and to the throat and mouth on the other. 
These cavities act as resonators. The main source of modification 
of the sound consists of the parts lying above the vocal cords— 
the laryngeal vestibule, the pharynx, mouth and nose. In order 
to produce this resonance there must be a varying tension of 
the walls and alterations in the length, breadth and shape of 
this continuous cavity as well as upward and downward move- 
ments of the larynx, alterations of the tongue, soft: palate, cheeks 
and lips. The sounds produced by the human voice are comprised 
in the interval of three and a half octaves. Few individuals ever 
attain a range of three octaves. The effective range of even a 
well-developed singer rarely exceeds two octaves.

which is limited to man—and which is, as we have elsewhere tried 
to bring out, the main behavior difference between man and brute 
—consists from the physical standpoint of a series of special 
expiratory and inspiratory sounds produced in the resonance 
cavity of the mouth, pharynx and nose. It need not be combined 
with laryngeal tones. In talking aloud, crying, or singing the 
laryngeal tones are combined with pharyngo-buccal sounds, but 
in whispering, that is, whispering without voice, there are no 
laryngeal tones. Since Czermak in 1858 improved the methods 
of laryngeal examination the larynx has been removed many 
times. Naturally the immediate effect of the removal of the 
larynx is to destroy the ability to speak aloud, since normal speech 
requires breath from the lungs acting upon the larynx, but so 
long as the air can pass from the lungs to the pharynx and 
mouth, faint whispered speech is possible. When the air passage 
is entirely closed between lungs and mouth, as happens when the 
windpipe is opened below the larynx and the patient has to 
breathe through an opening in the neck (tracheal cannula), all 
articulate speech even of the whispered sotto voce type disappears. 
But such individuals can and do still make all of the movements 
necessary for articulate speech. This is the answer to the criti- 
cisms which have been directed against the point of view that has 
been advocated throughout the text, namely, that thought is the 
action of language mechanisms.1 In our examination of the 
history of the cases where the larynx has been removed we 
have found nothing which would seriously discredit the view we 
have advocated. To destroy enough of the sensory motor 
mechanisms to make language organization and hence thought 
impossible would in all probability bring about the death of the 
patient. In view of the great importance from a theoretical 
standpoint of this subject it would seem-worth while to make a 
thorough study of such individuals. So far the observation of 
these cases has been left to the surgeons who have little theoretical

viduals with the breath cut off from the pharynx soon learn to speak by

Early Reflex and Instinctive Responses.—The birth ery be- 
gins the vocal career of the human child. This cry differs mark- 
edly in different babies. On the subject of early sounds in infants 
we quote Mrs. Blanton: 
The crying of one baby can be distinguished with some prac- 
tice from the cries of another even in a nursery of 25, the over: - 
tones varying just as in older people. Subject M., first day,u (cut), 
nah (at) accent on last syllable, wah (at), wuh (eut), ha (at). The 
“hunger ery’’ has generally a well-marked rhythm, the first syl- 
lable of preliminary sound coming on the first part of the first 
beat, the second or accented syllable on the second part of the 
first beat and a quick intake of breath as the third beat. This 
measure is most often repeated in groups of 5 or 6, each slightly 
more forceful than the preceding ones until the fourth or fifth, 
the last one being softer. Thus also will the groups be repeated. 
Each measure is also a trifle higher in pitch than the one 
preceding. 
Sounds Heard During the First Thirty Days——Consonant 
sounds commonly heard are m in conjunction with a as ma (at), 
n as nga (nat), g as gah, has in ha (at), w in wah (at), r as iv 
rah (at), ras in burr, very slight sound, and y as in yah (at). 
Vowel sounds are o as in owl, ¢ as in feel, 00 as in pool, a as in 
and and a as in father (relatively rare). 
The study which this author made on the vocal acts of infants 
was purely observational. No very satisfactory laboratory study 
has yet been made of the early instinctive vocal equipment of the 
infant. That it is vastly complex is admitted by every one. The 
extent to which the instinctive equipment varies in the different 
races is another interesting matter for speculation. The fact 
that a perfect speaking knowledge of a foreign language can be 
acquired only in early youth depends probably upon the struc- 
tural changes going on in thelarynx, ossification of those struc- 
tures beginning about the twentieth year. It is sometimes as- 
serted, of course, that the reason a foreign language is hard to 
learn is due to the lack of the proper vocal instincts, to differences 
 
-P-A-G-E-351
  EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT LANGUAGE HABITS 339 
in the resonating mechanisms, and the like. There is probably 
little evidence for this. %. 
Whether there are well-marked vocal instincts in the child 
corresponding to such instincts in other animals is not known 
with sureness. The popular view gives an affirmative answer 
here, namely, that there are distinct hunger cries, colic and pain 
cries and various other cries connected with emotional states, as 
the gurgle, coo, babble and many others. A good many of the 
articulate sounds that we make under strong emotional excite- 
ment may be the direct expression of vocal instincts, that is, they 
are not conventional speech words (or were not in origin) but 
* direct instinctive responses such, for example, as oh! la! ha! 
ugh! Individual variations in vocal sounds are well marked in 
infants at the earliest ages. One learns quickly to name the child 
which is crying or performing other vocal acts. 
Early Vocal Habits.—Serviceable studies of the formation of. 
early vocal habits and language habits proper have not yet been 
made in the laboratory. It is well to draw distinction between 
a voeal habit and a language habit. By vocal habit is meant the 
mere sounding of words of the non-instinctive type. The word 
has to be learned, but it may be learned as the parrot learns it. 
It has not yet been connected up with other vocal action and with 
general bodily actions. 
Ordinary observation shows that the earliest explicit. word 
habits are of this type. These early word habits are formed in 
- much the same way as are other explicit habits. The infant starts 
with his instinctive repertoire and the various word acts are 
fixed in the same way and by the same process that the successful 
act is fixed in any other habit. One additional factor seems to 
come in, namely, that of imitation. Imitation plays a very minor 
réle in the acquisition of manual habits. In the laboratory we 
have tried many times to get children from ten to eighteen months 
to imitate simple movements, like putting the hand flat upon the 
table, putting the two hands together, but without much success. 
The same may be said with reference to putting a child through 
various bodily acts. Apparently imitation of hand and general 
body movements cannot take place until the infant has already 
 
-P-A-G-E-352
S 
  340 PSYCHOLOGY 
learned to make a large group of well-codrdinated movements. 
In other words, imitation is not a process by means of which new 
(elementary) codrdinatioys may be formed. In the case of vocal 
acts there seems to be a difference. Imitation seems to be a process 
directly connected with the establishment of the act. The parents, 
of course, watch every new instinctive sound that approximates 
articulate speech and they immediately speak the word that is 
nearest the child’s own vocal efforts (for example, ‘‘ma,’’ ‘‘pa’’— 
“‘da’’). The imitation here may be more apparent than real. 
That is, the parents by repeating the sound constantly offer a 
stimulus for that which the infant’s vocal mechanisms are just 
set to utter.2 Whether the parent’s words can set the mechanism 
is doubtful. We may be accused here of fighting a straw man. 
Certainly imitation in the popular sense is the only way a new 
conventional word can be learned by the child until the elemen- 
tary laws of word formation are learned through reading and 
instruction. : 
Early Language Habits.—Vocal acts or habits, however 
Mumerous they may be, do not become language habits until they 
become associated with arm, hand and leg activities and substi- 
tutable for them. This probably accounts in a better way than 
any hypothetical change in brain structure for the relatively late 
putting on of language habits. As long as the child remains in 
its crib or in the arms of its mother, or has the whole household 
to wait upon it and anticipate its needs, there is no necessity 
for it to develop language. If we examine the bodily habits of 
any child just prior to the beginning of true language habits, we 
find that it can respond appropriately to hundreds of objects and 
situations, for example, to its doll, bottle, blocks, rattle and many 
other things. Its environment is becoming complex. Abbre- 
viated and short-circuited actions become a necessity if it is to 
hold its own in that environment and make progress. 
Let us give a partially hypothetical illustration of the way 
true language habits grow up. We will suppose that for some 
reason or other a child’s toys are laid away and covered up. 
*Conradi has shown that the forms of the cries and songs of young 
birds brought up by adults of a different species are greatly modified.
-P-A-G-E-353
  EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT LANGUAGE HABITS 341 
What does he do in such a situation? Essentially what the ani- 
mal does when it is hungry. The child begins general restless 
movements among which are movements of the language struc- 
tures as shown by its making ‘‘aimless’’ vocal sounds. His throat 
formation at that stage of growth is of such a character that a 
particular sound is uttered frequently (let us say ‘‘tata’’ for 
illustrative purposes). He begins to utter this sound as he roams 
about. The attendant, knowing the child’s range of toys and 
the frequency with which he plays with a certain one, predicts 
that an old rag doll is sought. She finds it, hands it to him and 
says, ‘‘Here’s your tata.’’ Repeat this process long enough and 
“‘tata’’ will be always used for rag doll and will always be 
spoken whenever the doll is sought. This process is, of course, 
repeated again and again in the course of a day. The word gets 
tied up with the act of seeking the doll. In this way baby words 
grow up as the first. genuine form of true language organization. 
A large number of these belong to the vocabulary of every child, 
such as the grunt or growl as a signal for attention to personal 
needs. The putting on of conventional speech habits is thus an 
illustration of conditioned reflex level of functioning (vocal 
habit) plus later associative connection of the word when learned 
with the bodily habits connected with the object for which the 
word stands (true language habits). To further illustrate our 
point we may give excerpts from an earlier statement: 
A stimulus to which a child often responds by opening and 
closing and putting objects into it is the box in which his toys 
are kept. The nurse, observing that the child reacts with his 
hands and fingers to the box begins at a suitable age to say ‘‘box’’ 
when the child is handed the box, ‘‘open box’’ when the child 
opens it, and ‘‘close box’’ when he closes it and ‘‘put blocks in 
box’’ when that act is executed. This is repeated over and over 
again until the conditioned reflexes are thoroughly established. 
In the course of time the box in front of him, which originally 
ealled out only bodily habits, now begins to call out word habits. 
He says ‘‘box’’ when it is handed to him, ‘‘open box’’ when he 
opens it. The sight of the box now becomes a stimulus capable 
of releasing either the bodily acts or the word acts, or both. A
-P-A-G-E-354
  342 PSYCHOLOGY 
series of functional connections is established between vision and 
throat and laryngeal muscles which exists alongside of the already 
earlier established connections which run from the same receptor 
to the arm and leg muscles. When the box is presented now, 
which act will take place? Manual action or laryngeal action? 
It is at this point that the influence of the environment upon the 
shaping and forcing of language habits comes clearly to the front. 
There comes an occasion when the box can be seen but not reached. 
Action in the hand is blocked. He speaks ‘‘box’’ and may speak 
it persistently all over the house. The attendant, hearing the 
word box, hastens to put it in his hands. In view of the fact that 
this situation is repeated day in and day out, not only with respect 
to this object but to hundreds of others, the child learns that the 
uttered word is a sufficient stimulus to cause the attendant to hand 
him the objects he names without actually having to execute 
bodily movements with respect to them. There has been a sub- 
stitution of the language habit for a bodily habit—now by a word 
he can cause adults to move—his grunt or growl or infant toy 
word is law. The tyranny with which the youngster rules this 
newly acquired kingdom is equaled by that displayed in the 
reign of but a few crowned heads in history. 
This roughly marks what we might call the genesis of a true 
language habit. It is a very inadequate account, but we are 
forced to be content with it until the process has been more ecare- 
fully studied in the laboratory. The formation of simple lan- 
guage habits has often been clothed with a good many high- 
sounding but rather meaningless phrases. For example, it is 
said that language is purely social and that words arise only by 
virtue of the fact that man is a social being. This is perfectly 
true in one respect, namely, that unless the child is surrounded by 
individuals who use conventional word forms he wouid never get 
the auditory and visual stimuli which would lead to such habit 
formation. On the other hand, they are no more social so far 
as the way in which they are acquired is concerned than are the 
bodily habits described in the last chapter.

vocabularies as consisting of 2000, 
960, and 400 words. Bateman,

children, states that 9 infants at the

Gradual Transition from Explicit to Implicit Language.— 
At what point in their language organization children make the 
transition from overt to whispered and then to implicit language 
has been studied only incidentally. Possibly all three forms go 
on together from the start. The reason why children are so talk-
-P-A-G-E-356
  344 PSYCHOLOGY 
ative probably is due to the fact that at an early age their envi- 
ronment does not force a rapid shift from explicit to implicit 
language (they are really thinking aloud. A good many so-called 
psycho-analytical factors also enter here). The shift is not 
complete even in the adult. This is clear from the observa- 
tion of individuals while they are reading and thinking. Many 
persons never get to the point where they can read without articu- 
lating the words sufficiently for the process to become overt 
—the lips are moved in unison with the eyes (or rather they lag 
behind the eye as does the voice when reading aloud). A good 
lip reader can’ actually gather some of the words read by such 
an individual. While thinking many use articulate speech or 
even lip speech much as do the readers just described. Again, 
certain people who talk to themselves incessantly when alone or 
when in the presence of one greatly inferior never complete the 
transition stage. Our view is that overt language develops under 
social training. It is thus absorbed into and becomes a part of 
every total integration of the individual. Hence when he is mak- 
ing adjustments in the absence of other like beings language 
remains as a part of the process. But there is no stimulus for 
him to talk aloud when alone; as a matter of fact, talking aloud . 
under such circumstances introduces conflicting stimuli, the au- 
ditory stimulus breaking in upon the otherwise silent room. 
Hence, silent talking takes place which rapidly improves by 
practice since it is exercised during every waking and certainly 
during many sleeping moments. In the acquisition of general 
bodily acts of skill we have found by experimentation that every 
short-cut possible which would abbreviate action and increase 
speed and skill is finally hit upon by the individual in a trial and 
error way. Sometimes we note this improvement and phrase it 
in words, often we neither note nor phrase it until long after it 
has been learned. The same thing undoubtedly takes place in 
silent talking or thinking. Even if we could roll out the implicit 
processes and record them on a sensitive plate or phonograph 
cylinder it is possible that they would be so abbreviated, short- 
circuited and economized that they would be unrecognizable 
unless their formation had been watched from the transition

  EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT LANGUAGE HABITS 345 © 
point where they are complete and social in character, to their 
final stage where they will serve for individual but not for so- 
cial adjustments. 
Non-Language Forms of Thought.—F rom our standpoint it 
is not necessary to assume that all thought is laryngeal even if we 
use ‘‘laryngeal’’ to include the whole mechanism described on page 
334. We have learned to write words, sentences and paragraphs, 
to draw objects and to trace them with the eyes, hands and fingers. 
We have done this so often that the process has become system- 
atized and substitutive. In other words, they come to serve as 
stimuli substitutable for the object seen, drawn, written or han- 
dled. These implicit processes may bring about a silent word 
(thought word), a spoken word (name of the object or associated 
word), or an appropriate bodily act. This form of implicit activ- 
ity is seen to best advantage in non-speaking individuals such as 
deaf mutes or blind deaf mutes. The author has carried out 
some correspondence with the constant companions of such 
individuals. These observers who have to communicate con- 
stantly with such defectives state that if the mutes are closely 
watched the sign language corresponding to lip activity in the 
reading of normal persons can be observed quite often. But of 
course, even in such cases there is a very rapid transition from 
overt sign language to implicit sign language. The moment the 
overt slips into the implicit, instrumentation becomes necessary 
to bring the process out for observation. 
It should be clear now that we would not abstract language, 
overt or implicit, or other implicit thought processes, from their 
general setting in bodily integration as a whole. The emphasis 
that we have placed upon it now and then may have led to that 
point of view. Our reason for such emphasis is that psychologists 
as a group have not-connected up thought with the rest of the 
process of integration. They have separated it out and made it 
something toto celo different from the organization processes 
with which we are now so familiar. Some writers make a com- 
plete mystery of it; something that we can talk about and discuss, 
something whose manifestations we may observe but whose 
essence we can never discover. Others have considered thought 
 
-P-A-G-E-358
346 PSYCHOLOGY 
processes as a correlate of cortical activity (a common assump- 
tion). They assume that it is something, no one knows quite 
what, that can go on in the absence apparently of all muscular 
activity. If our view is correct, it is a constituent part of every 
adjustment process. It is not different in essence from tennis- 
playing, swimming or any other overt activity except that it is 
hidden from ordinary observation and is more complex and at 
the same time more abbreviated so far as its parts are concerned 
than even the bravest of us could dream of. 
A More Detailed Analysis of Thinking.—The term thinking 
ought to be made to cover generally all implicit language activity 
and other activity substitutable for language activity. [It should 
be admitted furthermore that under proper stimulation (usu- 
ally a request is sufficient) the subject can be made to think 
aloud.] Thinking would comprise then the subvocal use of any 
language or related material whatever, such as the implicit 
repetition of poetry, day dreaming, rephrasing word processes in 
logical terms, running over the day’s events verbally, as well 
as implicit planning for the morrow and the verbal working out of 
difficult life situations. The term ‘‘ verbal ’’ here must be made 
broad enough to cover processes substitutable for verbal activity, 
such as the shrug of the shoulder and the lifting of the brows. 
It must embrace the implicit movements involved in written 
words or the implicit movements demanded in the use of the 
deaf-and-dumb sign manual, which are, in essence, word activity. 
Thinking then might become our general term to cover all sub- 
vocal behavior. It is obvious that this definition can take care 
of the most mechanical and deeply grounded of our language 
habits such as those used in the subvocal repetition of childhood 
verse, the repetition of stanzas of poetry, limericks, ete.; those 
depending more particularly upon emotional stimuli as day 
dreaming, as well as those verbal processes not completely habit- 
ual such as the working out of a lecture, the planning of a book; 
and finally those in which new results are brought out. It is 
clear that if in the interests of systematic psychology we need 
to sub-divide the whole process of thinking, three lines of cleavage 
will at once appear. 
 
-P-A-G-E-359
EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT LANGUAGE HABITS 347 
1. Mere unwinding of vocal habits where the word sequences 
are invariable : illustrated by rhymes, quotations ; by many of the 
responses in mathematics, as 2 and 2 equal 4, square root of 9 
equals 3, and the like. Here there is no new work, no trial move- 
ments like those we see in overt manual activity when a new 
situation capable of solution is presented the first few times. 
Such thinking corresponds to an extremely simple stimulus and 
response type of behavior. Similarly day dreaming would fall 
under this division. We assume that such dreaming takes place 
in response particularly to deficiency stimuli of one kind or 
another; such as the absence of sex activity, lack of food and 
water, lack of habitual surroundings and companions, lack of 
drugs, or even under the sway of drugs. 
2. The solving of problems which are not new, but which are 
so infrequently met with that trial verbal behavior is demanded ; 
illustrated probably by thinking out of stanzas, partially forgot- 
ten; in trying to apply one mathematical formula after another 
in a particular problem at hand. AJl of the part processes have 
been met with by the individual and are part of his organization, 
but he cannot use these part processes with machine-like facility. 
3. Finally we have the extreme extension of 2 above. Here 
the problem is new and the organism when confronting such a 
problem is in a grave situation. We will suppose, for example, 
that a man loses his position and wealth suddenly and must be 
ready in a few hours to act explicitly in a new undertaking. The 
problem, it is assumed, is of such a character that it must be 
worked out verbally before any overt action can take place. 
Hundreds of examples of this type immediately suggest them- 
selves. Most of the real social and moral problems appearing in 
one’s life are exactly of this type. 
These subdivisions are really guesses as to what may go on. 
No scientific division is as yet possible. It should be expressly 
stated, furthermore, that thinking in any of the above forms 
is not an isolated process. A human animal never gets away 
from his biography ; and the varying organic and emotional states 
the organism is in must exert a tremendous influence upon the 
course of his thinking. So that once more we would emphasize  
-P-A-G-E-360
348 PSYCHOLOGY 
the fact that thinking, whatever its type, is an integrated 
bodily process. 
Probably not many students would include 1 and 2 under 
the term ‘‘ thinking.’’ Thinking has come to be identified with 
3 of our division, but for no valid reason. We use the term 
manual activity when our subject ties his shoe strings in exactly 
the way we use it when he is learning to manipulate (for the 
first time) the most complicated of machine-gun mechanisms. 
In our opinion 3 represents a bit of behavior on the part of the 
human animal which, when stripped of its unessentials, is exactly 
like that bit of behavior which the rat exhibits when put into 
a complicated maze for the first time. When it gets to the food 
the autonomic strivings die down and it goes to sleep. The 
deficiency stimuli, lack of food, lack of usual surroundings, 
ete., cease to operate—the adjustment is complete. 
Surely a similar thing takes place in man. He is a verbally 
behaving animal. If he is put into a somewhat similar situation 
—when for example, his employer says to him: ‘‘ What would 
you do about this situation? ’’—describing to him a certain set 
of conditions—then trial and error thinking begins if the situa- 
tion is really new. Ask him to think aloud. Notice how he 
wanders verbally here and there.’’ No, I wouldn’t do that because 
of X, Y and Z.’’ Past verbal organization keeps guiding and 
goading him just as culs-de-sac control the rat in the maze. As 
soon as a point in the thinking progression is reached which 
causes the nagging impulses to search farther, to cease, then the 
adjustment is complete. It may take the form of overt action 
with the arms, hands, legs and trunk; it may be subvoeally ex- 
pressed, or expressed aloud in speech in the form of a ‘‘ judg- 
ment.’’ It may or may not be ‘‘ right ’’ (logical, moral, ete.). The 
rat, when he opens the box may be eating indigestible or poisoned 
food—or food deficient in vitamines—but nevertheless its prob- 
lem is solved because the nagging stimuli from the stomach have 
died away. So with the man’s verbal conclusions and judgments. 
The adjustment is complete—the problem solved for him—as 
soon as he has made a verbal (or other) response which allays,
-P-A-G-E-361
  EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT LANGUAGE HABITS 349 
causes to die down, intraorganic stimuli impelling him to fur- 
ther verbal activity. 
Illustration of Thinking Made Overt—Considerable knowl- 
edge about thinking behavior can be gained by making the subject 
think aloud. Usually a scientific man is quite willing to enter into 
such an experiment with zest. If I ask my subject in 1 to 
think aloud he overtly responds with his limerick, his day 
dreaming or his mathematical answer. Similarly if I ask him 
to think aloud in 2, I notice hesitations here and there, false starts 
and occasional returns, but in general a fairly ready response 
occurs with relatively few errors. It is only when we ask him 
to think aloud in 8 above that we begin to grasp how relatively 
crude is the process of thinking. Here we see typified all of the 
errors made by the rat in the maze ; false starts appear ; emotional 
factors show themselves, such as the hanging of the head and possi- 
bly even blushing when a false scent is followed up. The subject 
returns again and again to his starting point as shown by his 
asking: ‘‘ You say the given facts are so and so? ’’ The experi- 
menter says ‘‘ Yes’’ and again the subject starts off. In con- 
ducting an experiment of this kind, one has to be careful to 
impose problems upon his subject which are as far as possible 
removed from repressed emotional factors. It is never possible 
of course completely to do this as the analysts have more than 
once pointed out. The following illustration will make clear 
some of the points which appear in overt thinking. 
A colleague of mine came on a visit to stay in an apartment 
in which I had rooms. In a passage leading from the shower 
bath was a peculiar piece of apparatus standing near a sink. The 
essential features were a curved shallow nickel pan about twelve 
inches wide by twenty inches long; at one end the pan had been 
bent in in the form of a half circle, while at the other end the side 
pieces did not extend for the full width. The pan was mounted on 
a stand adjustable in height. Furthermore the pan itself was at- 
tached to the stand by a ball and socket joint. My friend had never 
seen anything like it and asked me what in the world it was. I told 
him I was writing a paper on thinking and pleaded with him to 
think his problem out aloud. He entered into the experiment in the 
proper spirit. I shall not record all of his false starts and returns  
-P-A-G-E-362
  350 PSYCHOLOGY 
but I will sketch a few of them. ‘‘ The thing looks a little like an 
invalid’s table, but it is not heavy, the pan is curved, it has 
side pieces and is attached with a ball and socket joint. It would 
never hold a tray full of dishes (cul de sac). The thing (return 
to starting point) looks like some of the failures of an inventor. 
I wonder if the landlord is an inventor. No, you told me he 
was a porter in one of the big banks down town. The fellow 
is as big as a house and looks more like a prize-fighter than a 
mechanician ; those paws of his would never do the work demanded 
of an inventor ’’ (blank wall again). This was as far as we got 
on the first day. On the second morning we got no nearer the 
solution. On the second night we talked over the way the porter 
and his wife lived, and the subject wondered how a man earning 
not more than $150 per month could live as our landlord did. I 
told him that the wife was a hair-dresser and earned about eight 
dollars per day herself. Then I asked him if he did not see the 
sign ‘‘ Hair-Dresser ’’ on the door as we entered. The next morn- 
ing after coming from his bath he said, ‘‘ I saw that infernal 
thing again ’’ (original starting point). ‘‘ It must be something 
to use in washing or weighing the baby—but they have no baby 
(cul de sac again). The thing is curved at one end so that it 
would just fit a person’s neck. Ah! I have it! The curve does 
fit the neck. The woman you say is a hair-dresser and the pan 
goes against the neck and the hair is spread out over it.’? This 
was the correct conclusion. Upon reaching it there was a smile, 
a sigh and an immediate turn to something else (the equivalent 
of obtaining food after search). 
Behaviorist’s Right to Assume That a Process of Implicit 
Thinking Goes on.—Notwithstanding the fact that we can make 
our subjects think aloud and thereby observe a large part of the 
process of thinking, Titchener some years ago raised the objection : 
““ How does the behaviorist know there is any such process as 
thinking since he cannot directly observe it? ’’ Titchener held the 
view that the behaviorist—qud behaviorist—doesn’t know that 
there is any such thing as thinking. The introspectionist claims 
that the behaviorist first uses the method of introspection to find 
thinking and having once found it shuts his eyes and turns his 
back upon his original method and begins to externalize the proc- 
   
 
-P-A-G-E-363
EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT LANGUAGE HABITS 351 
ess and to put it in the universal language of science. In other 
words, he describes it merely as the functioning of laryngeal or 
other motor processes. 
The behaviorist’s answer is that he can at present arrive at 
this conclusion only by making use of a logical inference. In 
those cases where the response to the stimulus is not immediate 
but where it finally occurs in some form of explicit verbal or 
manual behavior, it is safe to say that something does go on, 
and that that something is surely not different in essence from 
that which goes on when his behavior is explicit. Let us glance 
for a moment at a manual illustration. I hand a friend a gold 
cigarette case which can be opened only by pressing a secret 
spring. I tell him that he can keep the case if he can open it 
without violence. I watch him for two minutes, noting his 
rambling trial manipulatory movements. He fails to open it in 
this period of time. I then place him in a room alone, and tell 
him to come out when he has opened it. At the end of thirty 
minutes he emerges smiling and with the case open. Since there 
are no marks of violence on the case, the behaviorist, utilizing 
logic, has a right to assume that the subject continued to work 
at the problem as he had been trained to work at such problems 
and that his behavior in the empty room was essentially the same 
as that exhibited by him when he was under direct observation. 
Merely because observation of his behavior could not take place 
so long as he was hidden from the observer gives no one the 
right to assume that any different or unusual process went on. 
One need not hesitate to call this behavior on the part of our 
subject manual thinking or non-language thinking. There is no 
necessity for it, however, since our categories of trial-and-error 
learning, functioning of habit, etc., are adequate. We suggest 
manual thinking here to show its complete homology with that 
type of behavior described below which is more universally 
ealled thinking. 
Suppose instead of giving him a problem which can be learned 
by manual trial-and-error manipulation I say: ‘‘ What would be 
the result on your social and vocational life if through some acci- 
dent you suddenly had both arms removed? ’’ Assuming, as 
would be safe in most instances, that such a problem had not  
-P-A-G-E-364
  352 PSYCHOLOGY 
hitherto been faced and formulated, he would be unable to give 
any adequate statement. Suppose we insisted upon a formula- 
tion. At the end of an hour he would probably be able to return 
a fairly comprehensive reply. Surely the behaviorist has the 
right to assume, that implicit language activity, sensori-motor 
in character, has been taking place during the hour on as grand 
a scale as overt bodily movements would have been taking place 
had I left him in a room from which there was no obvious exit 
and suddenly yelled ‘‘ Fire! ’’ from the outside. We can infer 
that language activity from infancy onward has been developed 
just to meet such situations; hence that during the period of his 
apparent immobility he was using implicit language processes. 
Such processes are the only available types of organization which 
we have any objective right to assume can be used in such 
a situation.1 
  
+In other words, since our assumed explanation is simple and straight- 
forward and adequate to account for all the facts and is in line with what 
can actually be observed in other activities, the law of parsimony demands 
that the upholders of “imagery” and “imageless thought ” should show 
the need of such “ processes” and demonstrat objectively their presence. 
In fairness to the behaviorist it should be admitted that words or even 
objects not usually visually reacted to may through the mechanism of the 
conditioned reflex arouse muscular reactions in the eyelid, in the muscles 
of the eye, in the pupil, and even in the retina itself. Apparently there is 
considerable evidence, as we have pointed out elsewhere, that the retina 
is supplied with centrifugal neural elements. This position is highly specu- 
lative but it does give us, theoretically at any rate, a possibility of account- 
ing for a visual stimulus constituent in the absence of actual light. It 
may be that this intraorganically aroused visual constituent is a much 
more important element in the total stimulating situation than has been 
generally admitted. The delicate changes going on in the action currents 
of the eye lend some support to this view. The long-delayed appearance of 
after-images now established by Swindel’s work also support it as do the 
phenomena appearing in ordinary after images, phosphenes, electrical 
stimulation of the eye, hallucinations, dreams and the like. 
Whether a similar set of conditions can take place in the case of the 
ear is more doubtful. The presence of centrifugal neural elements entering 
the tectorial and basilar membranes of the inner ear has not to our knowl- 
edge been discovered. 
From the standpoint of theory, this distinction between a visual reac- 
tion and a “visual image” is important. There is inherent in it the dif- 
ference between a thoroughgoing monism and a thoroughgoing dualism. 
 
-P-A-G-E-365
  EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT LANGUAGE HABITS 353 
Some unpublished results of experiments of Dr. K. 8. Lashley, 
egin to approach a scientific proof that essentially the same 
type of responses goes on-in-implicit thinking as goes on in more 
explicit_types of-verbal response. With a delicate apparatus 
which recorded the tongue movements in two dimensions he was 
enabled to show that the overt but whispered repetition of a sen- 
tence produced a tracing on the smoked drum whieh was wholly 
similar except for amplitude to that obtained when he told the 
subject to think the same thing without making overt movements. 
He was enabled to verify this again and again. On the other hand 
if he obtained a standard tracing to a whispered sentence and 
then gave the subject other work to do and later came back and 
asked him to think the sentence, there was no obvious correspond- 
ence in the two tracings (the original motor set had changed). 
This is not an argument against our point if we recall how varied 
is the musculature of the larynx and the throat. We can write 
the same word by a dozen different combinations in the holding 
of the pen. We can speak or.think the same word by many differ- 
ent muscular combinations. 
The behaviorist need be no more afraid to admit that the 
subject himself could observe during the apparent immobile 
period that he used words and sentences (and that for a part 
of the time he did not know what he was using!) than to admit 
that the subject can observe that he himself is laying bricks or 
playing a piano. We have elsewhere admitted a verbal report 
method but at the same time insisted upon its untrustworthiness 
for scientific purposes. To know anything worth while for 
science about my brick-laying we must get a Gilbreth or some 
other observer to record by motion pictures or otherwise my every 
act while laying bricks. In other words, scientific conclusions 
demand instrumentation. I can observe roughly that I have 
raised a wall four feet high by my day’s work, but I cannot 
determine how many millions of useless movements I have made or 
how these useless movements could be eliminated by a change 
in my method of work. Apparently the same thing is true of 
thinking. The subject can observe that he is using words in 
thinking. But-how much word material is used, how much his 
final formulation is influenced by implicit factors which are    
-P-A-G-E-366
  354 ' PSYCHOLOGY 
not put in words and which he cannot himself observe, cannot 
be stated by the subject himself. 
The point we would emphasize here is that if we are ever 
to learn scientifically any more about the intimate nature of 
thought other than that which can be obtained by observing 
the end results—that is, by observing the overt verbally expressed 
behavior or the overt ensuing bodily actions—we shall have to 
resort to instrumentation. The time seems far off when such 
a thing is possible. While awaiting it the behaviorist has ample 
with which to occupy himself. Furthermore he is not in such 
bad straits after all. The physiologists in many cases have to be 
content with their observations of end results. We know many 
factors which affect the functioning of the parotid gland. We 
count the drops of saliva which issue from it under varying con- 
ditions of stimulation. We analyze the chemical changes occur- 
ring, ete. But what goes on in the gland itself we cannot say. 
But no one would have the temerity to assume that for this 
reason there is no physiology of the gland. We can speculate 
about what goes on inside of the gland, what the function of the 
unstriped muscular tissue is, why the solution is now thick, now 
thin, whether the gland would secrete if this or that were done. 
But those speculations to be of any value must be couched in 
some kind of terms which will lead not to metaphysical fancies 
but to some kind of experimental attack. If they do not lead 
to an experimental attack, no physiologist will long entertain 
them. The behaviorist feels that we are in exactly this same 
position with regard to thinking. 
“Meaning,” an Experimental Problem and Not a Problem of 
Philosophy or of Speculative Psychology.—One of the chief 
criticisms brought against this conception of thinking is that 
“* it does not explain meaning.’’ This criticism is urged seriously 
notwithstanding the fact that current introspective psychology 
has no explanation of meaning to offer. Structural psychology 
involves itself everywhere in a sea of words when it tries to 
make one ‘‘ image ’’ mean another ‘‘ image.”’ 
From the behaviorist’s point of view the problem of ‘‘ mean- 
ing ’’ is a pure abstraction. It never arises in the scientific 
observation of behavior. We watch what the animal or human 
   
-P-A-G-E-367
EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT LANGUAGE HABITS 355 
being is doing. He ‘‘means’’ what he does. It serves no 
scientific or practical purpose to interrupt and ask him while he 
is in action what he is meaning. His action shows his meaning. 
Hence, exhaust the conception of action—.e., experimentally 
determine all of the organized responses a given object can 
call forth in a given individual, and you have exhausted all 
possible ‘‘ meanings ’’ of that object for that individual. To 
answer what the church means to men it is necessary to look 
upon the church as a stimulus and to find out what reactions 
are called out by this stimulus in a given race, in a given group 
or in any given individual. Parallel with this query we can 
carry out another as to why the church calls out such and such 
responses. This might take us into folk lore and into the in- 
fluence of the code upon the individual, into the influence of 
parents upon children, causing the race to project the father 
and mother into a heavenly state hereafter; finally into the 
realms of the incest complex, homosexual tendencies, and so on. 
In other words, it becomes like all others in psychology, a prob- 
lem for systematic observation and experimentation. We have 
emphasized these general statements about meaning in this con- 
nection because it is often said that thinking somehow peculiarly 
reveals meaning. If we look upon thinking as a form of action 
comparable in all its essential respects to manual action, such 
speculations concerning meaning in thinking lose their mystery 
and hence their charm. 
Summary of Behaviorist’s Conception of Thinking.—Think- 
ing is largely a verbal process ; occasionally expressive movements 
substitutable for word movements (gestures, attitudes, ete.) enter 
in as a part of the general stream of implicit activity. Thinking 
in the narrow sense where learning is involved, is a trial-and- 
error process wholly similar to manual trial and error. Verbal 
manipulation along one line is checked and stopped and a new 
line is begun for exactly the same reasons that such processes are 
checked and begun in manual learning. The thinking adjust- 
ment is achieved when the final word-grouping (sentence or 
judgment) or overt bodily reaction which comes as the end result 
of the process of thinking makes the initial stimulus to thinking 
inoperative or inert; that is, the final reaction, verbal or other, 
 
-P-A-G-E-368
    
356 PSYCHOLOGY 
so changes the general state of the organism as a whole that the 
original stimulating factor can no longer act upon the subject. 
A crude illustration which ean properly be carried over to thought 
is to be found in the hungry hunter’s eager search for game. 
He finds it, captures it, prepares and eats it, lights his pipe 
and lies down. The hares and quail may peek at him from every 
corner of the brush, but their driving power for the time is gone. 
LABORATORY STUDIES IN LANGUAGE ORGANIZATION* 
C. Acquisirion AND IMPROVEMENT. 
Types of Investigations in Language Functions.—Language 
acquisitions, both explicit and implicit, have been studied only 
incidentally in the laboratory and usually in their highly organ- 
ized and total forms such as solving arithmetical problems, com- 
mitting verse and prose to memory; with later retesting of such 
activities to obtain a measure of the factor of disuse. A few of 
the studies deal directly with the learning of a foreign language. 
Our more immediate concern here is the investigation of word 
organization. Several studies have been made upon adults. 
That of Ebbinghaus is best known. In 1885 he made a most care- 
ful study of the learning of nonsense syllables. Nonsense words 
or syllables are made by separating two consonants with a vowel 
as ver, gax and moc. Whenever a conventional word is formed 
by this combination it is discarded. It is possible to construct 
some two thousand three hundred nonsense words. In this way 
the attempt is made to get material uniform in difficulty and 
without wide associative connections. The organism in learning 
it is made to function on almost an infantile plane. Short 
or long lists of these nonsense syllables may be made up and pre- 
sented to the subjects through the eye or the ear. The presenta-   
*Space limitations deter us from giving any discussion of the acquisi- 
tion of writing (Judd, Freeman and others) ; of the studies on the associated 
action of the eyes in reading (Judd, Holt, Huey and others), or of the 
formation of the various types of language habits in deaf mutes with and 
without blindness. All of the researches in these fields contribute to our 
data on language organization in general and of the connection of laryngeal 
action with manual. The pathological literature on speech defects and the 
functional cases of stuttering and stammering are also contributive.

EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT LANGUAGE HABITS 357 
tion is repeated again and again until a certain standard pro- 
ficiency in the habit is obtained. Usually unless the effect of 
overtraining is being studied the standard is the ability to repeat 
the whole series in order once without error (Ebbinghaus). 
Some of the later investigators have demanded the ability to 
repeat the whole series twice. Concerning such acquisition the 
following summary of results may be given: 
1. Length of the Series and Time of Learning—One of the 
first things that Ebbinghaus brought out was the fact that it 
takes a disproportionate amount of time to learn a long series 
than a short one, for example, he found that with one reading, 
a series of 7 or 8 syllables could be learned. The table below 
brings out the relatively greater amount of work required as the 
number of syllables in the series is increased. 
Number of repetitions Number of syllables necessary for first 
in a series errorless production 
th 1 
12 16.6 
16 30.0 
24 44.0 
36 55.0 
Later investigations have found that the longer series do not 
require nearly so disproportionate an amount of time as Ebbing- 
haus’ results would seem to indicate. 
2. Acquisition of Sense Material—The same author learned 
stanzas of Byron’s Don Juan. Each stanza required scarcely 8 
repetitions in order to enable the learner to recite it correctly. 
Each of the stanzas contained 80 syllables. Each syllable, how- 
ever, consisted on the average of less than 3 letters. If we con- 
trast the number of presentations required to learn 80 syllables, 
the syllables being grouped into ordinary words, with the number 
of presentations required to learn 80 nonsense syllables, it will 
be found that the sense material requires relatively few. Ebbing- 
haus estimated that if a series of 36 nonsense syllables requires 
55 repetitions for learning, 80-90 syllables would require at least 
80 repetitions; since the sense material required only about 9 
repetitions it follows that the learning of sense material requires 
only about 1/10 as much practice as nonsense material.

  358 | PSYCHOLOGY 
3. Effect of Changing the Order of the Syllables in a Non- 
sense Series——The nonsense material gives us an interesting 
opportunity of testing some of the fundamental facts about 
human learning. When any given succession of events or objects 
is presented serially the parts are learned in the order given. We 
have discussed this problem to a certain extent already under 
the heading of the determiners of act (page 319) and we found 
there that frequency was a most potent factor in determining 
which act will next be performed. In other words, if acts have 
been learned in the order A, B, C, D, E, F, and the individual 
is now performing act E, other things being equal, it is safe to 
predict that act F will follow next because it has most frequently 
followed E. The question is whether E is the sole determiner 
of F. The answer has been conclusively returned from the study 
of nonsense material. Not only is E a determiner of F, but like- 
wise also in varying measure D, C,B, A. To test this Ebbinghaus 
learned on any given day several series of nonsense syllables and 
then made up from this once-learned material several new series. 
One of the new series was made by skipping one syllable, another 
by skipping two syllables and so until six syllables were skipped. 
The following scheme will make this clear. Let the various 
series once learned be represented by Roman figures and the posi- 
tions of the various members of this series by the Arabic numerals 
as follows: 
OT) 802). IRON hee ee 1(15) 1(16) 
ON Gly) eT (2). TC i te eee ae hee I1(15) I1(16) 
BYE CL PPVIL (2)  WARCB)) 5a Boa ete Seopa + V1I(15) VI(16) 
The ‘‘skipping-one’’ series would then be made up as follows: 
mA) (8) EG) Ue 1(15) 1(2) 1(4) 1(6)—1(16) 
The other series, of course, can be made up in the same way by 
skipping two syllables, three, and so on. If the syllables are 
learned merely in the order in which they are presented and the 
determiner of each succeeding act is solely the act which has 
just preceded, then the series made by skipping series ought to 
be as difficult to learn as the originals, Such is by no means the 
ease. All of the ‘‘skip’’ series are learned more readily than the

of the various derived series, the saving is as follows: The 
average for the original learning (6 series) was 1266 seconds; 
skipping 1, the saving was 110 seconds; skipping 2, 79 seconds; 
skipping 3, 64 seconds; skipping 6, 40 seconds. Where the series 
are jumbled together (permutation) there is no saving in time 
of re-learning. We thus see in learning series of nonsense syl- 
lables that every syllable is tied up in a forward direction with 
every other one. In a similar way it has been shown that they are 
tied up in a backward direction as well. 
The Acquisition of More Complex Material_—Several 
studies have been made upon material which brings about organ- 
ization or reorganization of the implicit processes such as the 
learning of a new language or telegraphy. No experimental 
studies have been made on learning to compose music. The 
learner who studied Russian in an experimental way (Swift) had 
had no previous training in that language. The study began 
March 30, 1905, and ended June 14 of the same year. It con- 
sisted of 30 minutes’ study followed immediately by a 15 minutes’ 
test of reading ability. The daily study of 30 minutes was car- 
ried on in the ordinary way, the time being divided among the 
vocabulary, conjugations and declensions. No effort was made 
to work under any great strain. The score was made on the basis 
of the number of words read during the daily 15 minutes’ test. 
The learning curve (not shown) shows the same factors at work 
as in the acquisition of manual skill—a rather rapid rise at first,
-P-A-G-E-372
  360 PSYCHOLOGY 
a severe slip back, then another rapid rise, another severe slip 
back, then a slower gradual rise with marked fluctuations. The 
rate of progress even at the beginning was much slower than 
learning to typewrite. The curve as a whole shows a surprising 
number of plateaux, at least four well-marked ones appearing, 
but the lack of material in the day’s lesson and the unsatisfactory 
way in which such scores can be obtained probably keep the curve 
from being a true picture of such acquisitions. The average score 
on the first two days was about 20 words read per 15 minutes; the 
average score on the 65th day was approximately 65. Bryan 
and Harter have given a somewhat better controlled study in 
learning to receive telegraphic messages. The curve of receiv- 
ing rises quite slowly, very much more slowly and irregularly 
than does the curve for sending messages, since sending is a 
much less complex habit to form. Furthermore, the curve is 
marked by several plateaux, each plateau being followed by a 
period of more or less marked improvement. 
Improvement in Subvocal Arithmetic.—It is very difficult, 
of course, to find examples in the experimental literature of acqui- 
sition or improvement in pure implicit laryngeal work. Possibly 
the best examples of such work and of the types of improvement 
that occur are found in the working of arithmetic problems with- 
out exteroceptive aids: Starch worked with eight subjects and 
had them multiply a three-place by a one-place number—50 
examples per day for 14 days. A table follows (quoted from 
Thorndike) :

It will be seen that the improvement was quite marked, that the 
small amount of practice done on each day for 14 days enabled
-P-A-G-E-373
  
EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT LANGUAGE HABITS 361 
the subjects to do nearly twice as many examples on the average 
as they could do at the beginning of practice. This example, 
of course, must be looked upon as improvement in a given func- 
tion and not as the acquisition of a totally new habit. The sub- 
jects were adults and hence already possessed a respectable 
measure of ability in this function. Several other individuals 
have studied improvement in subvocal arithmetic. In general 
the results are similar to those obtained by Starch. 
It would be extremely instructive to obtain data on the acqui- 
sition and improvement in laryngeal organization of other types. 
For example, we know nothing in a statistical way concerning 
improvement of ability in subvocal reading or of such total activ- 
ities as constructing a lecture, organizing a book or planning 
an. invention. 
“Transfer” of Practice From One Language Function to 
Another.—We gave, on page 310, a short statement of the ‘‘trans- 
fer’’ of training both in the realm of manual activity and in 
laryngeal. It seems well to note here again that there is a slight 
transfer in most cases, but in general this can be accounted for 
on the basis of the identical elements or identical part processes 
involved in the two activities under observation. 
Summary of Experimental Studies in Laryngeal Learn- 
ing.—The formation of laryngeal habits is a subject which has 
been very inadequately studied in psychology largely because 
of the difficulties involved in getting a measure of improvement 
and in general in controlling the results. Very many functions 
which combine laryngeal with manual activity have been studied 
very carefully in the laboratory, such as the improvement in mark- 
ing given letters on a page of ordinary print, putting English 
prose into German script, writing prose in code, and the like. 
On page 326 we have already considered certain of these habits, 
such as typewriting. 
vv 1m general, it may be said that the acquisition of laryngeal 
habits is similar in most respects to the learning of manual acts. 
Laryngeal activity: has not been studied with sufficient thorough- 
ness for us to give it any detailed discussion.

Effect of No Practice on Laryngeal Habits —Ebbinghaus 
and others have tested quite extensively the effect of disuse (for- 
getting) upon nonsense syllables. One of the things which ap- 
peared earliest was the fact that after a series of nonsense 
syllables had been learned to the point of one errorless reproduc-_ 
tion and then put away, it could not be repeated twenty minutes 
later. The most interesting thing appearing was the fact that 
any such disused series could be re-learned much more rapidly 
than originally. Hence it became possible to adopt the following 
method: To learn a large number of nonsense syllables, say & 
series of 13 syllables each, and then re-learn one at the end of 
20 minutes, another after an hour, another after one day and 
so on. A numerical measure of the saving can be obtained by 
subtracting the number of repetitions required for re-learning 
from the number of repetitions required in the original learning. 
The following table from Ebbinghaus gives in percentage the 
amount of time saved in re-learning the nonsense syllables after 
varying intervals: 4 
Length of period of disuse Gain in per cent. 
5 minutes 100 
63 minutes 44.2 
525 minutes 55.8 
1 day 33.8 
2 days 21.2 
6 days 25.2 
31 days 21.2 
In other words, this table shows that the loss is very rapid at 
first and very slow thereafter: )) After the interval of an hour, 
more than half the original work has to be done before-the series 
can be repeated without error.) After 8 hours almost 24 of the 
original work is necessary. After 24 hours the rate of deteriora- 
tion is very slow indeed. The table is shown graphically in Fig. 
64. These experiments have been repeated by Radossawljewitsch, 
by Bean and by students of nearly every laboratory. In general, 
Ebbinghaus’s work has been confirmed with the possible exception 
that the loss is less severe at the start than he shows it to be. All 
  \  
-P-A-G-E-375
  
EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT LANGUAGE HABITS 363 
investigators agree that the loss is at first extremely rapid. If 
this rapid deterioration in a language function is contrasted with 
the hardly perceptible loss in typewriting (page 326) after long 
periods of no practice the difference in the two types of function, 
so far as deterioration in the non-practice period is concerned, 
appears with startling clearness. The curve given below shows 
the loss during the first 24 hours. 
Retention of Sense Material—Radossawljewitsch and also 
Magneff studied the effect of disuse on sense material (poetry) 
learned to the point of two perfect reproductions and then re- 
learned after a certain interval. The loss after disuse for vary- 
ing intervals was determined as for nonsense syllables in the 
above test of Ebbinghaus. The following table presents part of 
the results: 
Length of period of disuse Gain in per cent. 
19 minutes 58.2 
20 minutes 95.2 
60 minutes 80.9 
480 minutes 57.9 
1 day 79.2 5 days 56.5 
14 days 30 
30 days 23.9 
It will be seen that the loss is. not so rapid at first.as in the case 
of nonsense syllables;but that the loss at the end of thirty days 
is approximately_the same. 
It is unfortunate that there are no good studies of this type 
of forgetting. Radossawljewitsch’s work shows so much varia- 
tion as likewise does Magneff’s that too great dependence cannot 
be placed in them. In apparent contradiction to this rapid for- 
getting of sense material stand the cases where poems learned 
in early childhood can be repeated after years of disuse; sim- 
ilarly parts of chapters from the Bible learned in youth, and con- 
versations heard in childhood can be repeated in old age. But 
these were originally-overlearned and in youth were many times 
taken up and re-learned. Such examples are in no sense a con- 
tradiction of the work which has been done in the laboratory.

  EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT LANGUAGE HABITS 365 
nonsense syllables was just barely learned. The question arises 
next as to what the effect would be in time saved in re-learning 
if, instead of stopping learning at this point, we continued it for 
some time. Ebbinghaus found that a of reading a series 
over more often than was necessary to be able to just repeat it 
was not lost.) If it is presented three times more to-day than is 
required for a first errorless repetition, one presentation will be 
saved in the re-learning twenty-four hours afterwards; if read 
six times more than necessary to-day, two repetitions will be saved 
in re-learning after a similar lapse of time. This saving does not 
continue in the same ratio when the number of presentations 
given in learning is increased beyond sixty-four? 
Can Memory be Improved?—In order to answer this ques: 
tion it seems necessary topoint out that when it is asked, memory 
is used in a sense somewhat different from that employed in the 
present text. Memory in this enlarged sense refers really to the 
whole process of learning and re-learning. Of course, even in 
the formation of a habit by daily practice retention of what 
was learned the day before must occur or progress is blocked. 
The question really at issue can be put concretely: Given homo- 
geneous but different material, for example, several thousand 
lines of prose to learn verbatim, and assume that I have had some 
practice in committing (learning) such material, will I be able 
to learn the last hundred lines any more rapidly than the first 
hundred lines? Or again, assuming that all ten syllable series 
of nonsense material are of equal difficulty, will the learning of 
a thousand series decrease materially the length of time it takes 
me to commit such material?” From the standpoint of acquisition 
it seems to be true that there is a certain coefficient of commit- 
ment for each individual which for that individual remains almost 
permanent. Undoubtedly there is some slight improvement, but 
Ebbinghaus, after working some three or four years with nonsense 
material, found no very great improvement. 
The question also refers to the amount of loss after a period 
of no practice. All of the experiments seem to show, assuming 
that the material was learned in an associated and connected way 
in the first place, that there is no way to stop the loss except by    
-P-A-G-E-378
  366 PSYCHOLOGY 
greatly overlearning. There are a great many mnemonic devices 
and special association schemes for ‘‘improving’’ memory. Many 
of them are exceedingly ingenious and ‘‘guaranteed to improve 
one’s memory one hundred per cent. in thirty days.’’ There is 
- nothing new in any of these schemes and they certainly do not 
“improve the memory’’ in the sense that psychologists would 
use the term improvement. 
Of prodigies in memory little can be said. That there are 
enormous individual variations in the ability cf different people 
to carry around with them isolated dates, numbers, whole pages 
of scientific material, is well known by every one. Little fur- 
ther can be said on the topic. They belong in the same class with 
the other types of prodigies, for example, the infant mathemat- 
ical wonder and the child musician and composer. 
Concluding Statements.—It would be instructive to take up 
the study of language in some of its broader aspects; in par- 
ticular the following points would be of special interest to psy- 
chologists: (1) The acquisition of language in blind deaf-mutes. 
(2) The symbolic and folk-lore side of our own and other lan- 
guages. (3) Stuttering, stammering and allied defects. (4) 
The effect of central nervous system lesions upon language 
mechanisms, as is seen in aphasia and in agraphia. (5) The 
speech of psychopathic individuals, especially the phenomena 
seen in the flights of the manic, the disintegration of speech in 
paretics and the organized language systems of the paranoiac 
types. (6) The slang and profane words and their connection 
with emotional states. (7) The language systems in day and 
night dreaming. Most of these topies are so broad that even a 
central viewpoint cannot be given without devoting a special 
chapter to each. 
We have attempted in the present chapter merely to trace the 
similarity in the development and use of explicit and implicit 
language activities to the development and use of other forms 
of bodily integration. Language is an intimate and necessary 
part of the individual’s adjustments. While we have singled out 
language functions for special study, it must be recalled that 
several times we have mentioned the artificiality of this pro-
-P-A-G-E-379

cedure. The normal human organism functions as a whole al- 
ways. Through training it becomes organized in all of its parts 
to make a certain adjustment or perform a certain act, be that 
act the driving of a nail, flying across the Atlantic Ocean or 
Itiplying silently one four-place number by another four- 
place number. Each of these complex functions has as its con- 
stituent parts emotional, instinctive, and explicit and implicit 
habit factors. The parts are all tied together and work together 
when the individual is performing that function. Our illustra- 
tion in the previous chapter of the behavior of the motor-boat 
owner in trying to make his engine run properly shows the closely 
interlocking, integrated activity of the hands, arms and legs, 
involving also instinctive emotional factors and finally language 
activity ; it is typical of all adjustments. 
The present chapter finishes our study of the genesis and fune- 
tioning of part reactions. In it we have tried to present the data 
which will enable the student to put the organism back together 
again and view him as an, integrated, biological going concern. 
This completely integrated organism is a personality or indi- 
vidual. The following chapter takes up the individual at work 
upon one or another problem.
-P-A-G-E-380
  CHAPTER X 
THE ORGANISM AT WORK 
A. Tue Functioning or EstasuisHep Hasir Sysrems. 
What is Meant by Function.—Several times in the text we 
have had occasion to speak of functions. Now that we have ex- 
amined most of the phases of an individual’s acquisitions both of 
the explicit and implicit kinds it seems well to get a more exact 
formulation of what is meant by the term. After an act has 
been acquired and used for a definite time and is then repeatedly 
put away and again used, the learning and re-learning phases 
and periods of no practice become of little consequence. We 
assume that every normal individual can perform the acts re- 
quired by a social environment and we do not care particularly 
whether it took him a long time to learn them or a short time. 
We are interested, in the discussion which follows, in the question 
as to the rapidity and accuracy with which those habits work and 
the factors which influence them. It is convenient to call each 
organized habit system of an individual which is always ready 
to act under appropriate stimulation, an acquired function, in 
contrast to emotional and instinctive functions. (The total assets 
of an individual are the sum of his hereditary and acquired 
functions, his retentiveness and his plasticity.) Examples of 
such acquired functions are, of course, talking, walking, swim- 
ming, addition, subtraction, writing and all similar ones discussed 
in the preceding two chapters. As we use the term, it has no 
fixed implication and is not a mathematical or even a rigidly 
scientific one. A function is really, then, a phase of activity that 
one happens to be studying and measuring; the acquired func- 
tions are equivalent really to habits except for the fact that when 
we use the term function we generally (but not even here always) 
leave the genetic aspect out of consideration. New habits, if 
continued, end always by giving us new functions. In studying 
children (or adults if learning) the term habit is emphasized; 
in studying adults the term function is most frequently met with, 
368
-P-A-G-E-381
THE ORGANISM AT WORK 369 
since in the adult the learning and re-learning aspects are not of 
importance unless we wish to get some index of an individual’s 
plasticity. This distinction between the genetic or acquisition 
phase of any activity and its later exercise has led to some con- 
fusion in psychology. 
The efficiency of these organized functional systems never 
changes very much in the adult. They are not practiced suffi- 
ciently at any one time or under the right conditions for any 
great improvement to occur. On the other hand, they are used 
so frequently that the memory loss is insignificant after a period 
of no practice. As adults we are on a permanent plateau with 
respect to the efficiency of most customary acts: that drugs, lack 
of oxygen, emotional disturbances and environmental changes in 
general can produce greater or less fluctuations in efficiency, 
temporary in character, will now appear.. 
“ Fatigue ” Not a Serviceable Conception in Psychology.— 
Probably the most essential thing for the beginning student to 
do or for any scientific man planning to do research in the field 
of human work is to neglect most of the general discussions which 
have gathered around the subject of fatigue. James somewhere 
says about emotion: ‘‘But as far as ‘scientific psychology’ of the 
emotions goes I may have been surfeited by too much reading of 
classical work on the subject, but I should as lief read verbal 
descriptions of the shapes of the rocks on a New Hampshire farm 
as toil through them again.’’ Much the same could be said 
about fatigue. The literature from the standpoint of discussion 
is complex and confusing and worthless both because it is not 
constructive and because it deters men from engaging in the study 
of the factors influencing the curve of work. Three reasons 
ean be advanced for this condition: (1) and most important, 
confusion starts the moment the human animal is dissected into 
a so-called ‘‘mental’’ worker and ‘‘physical’’ worker. This is a 
most pernicious way of splitting up human activity. No matter 
what the human animal is doing he works as a whole. What 
measure of truth is to be found in this division can be better 
formulated by saying that certain activities, like splitting wood 
or dragging a cannon over muddy ground, demand the fune-
-P-A-G-E-382
370 PSYCHOLOGY 
tioning mainly of that part of the individual’s organization con- 
nected with the use of the large muscles of the body. When we 
need a short phrase we characterize it simply as manual work. 
To use the term manual in this broad way is, of course, to strip 
it of its etymological setting. When the individual is multi- 
plying or adding or planning the details of a lecture the process 
involves mainly that part of his organization connected with the 
small muscles employed in using words. Short characterizing 
phrases are subvocal work or vocal work, depending upon whether 
the work is done silently (thought) or spoken aloud. But neither 
in manual work nor in implicit laryngeal work does action take 
place only in the specified parts. The manual worker may be 
thinking of his family or of the nearness of meal-time, whereas 
the laryngeal worker may be tearing his hair or walking up and 
down the room. (2) The attempt is made to literally drag in 
by the hair pictures of what goes on in the nervous system and 
the muscles. Thorndike, who in general stays closest to investi- 
gatable grounds, defines ‘‘mental work’’ as work done by the 
animal’s connection system. ‘‘When, however, such a total activ- 
ity is examined more critically, it is found desirable to separate 
off the work and fatigue of the sense organ and of the end plate 
in the muscle from the work of the connection system and to 
distinguish sensorial fatigue, intellectual fatigue and muscular 
fatigue. For the action of a sense organ or of an end plate is 
only partly, and the action of a muscle fiber is not at all, like 
that of the connecting neurone.’’ He passes into the realm of 
classification of fatigue with a vengeance in the following note: 
“Tt will doubtless be better in the long run to subdivide the 
work of the human animal still further and to replace the terms 
sensory, mental and muscular work by the work of the accessory 
apparatus of the sense organs, the work of the peripheral end 
of the first sensory neurone, the work of conduction along a neu- 
rone, the work of conduction across a synapse from neurone to 
neurone, the work of changing the intimacy of synapses, the 
work of conduction from the ending of a neurone to a muscle, 
the work of the muscle fibers.’” (Italics in text omitted.) 
(3) The final factor which has brought the psychology of
-P-A-G-E-383
  THE ORGANISM AT WORK 371 
fatigue to such a helpless position is the attempt to keep safe the 
tenets of psycho-physical parallelism. The discussion of this con- 
cept belongs to the realm of metaphysics. It can be left safely 
to the philosophers. 
In approaching the problem of the exercise of a function both 
from the standpoint of research and for collecting data on what 
has been done it seems safe to assume that no confusion can 
result and that nothing will be lost to science if psychology will 
discard the concept of fatigue altogether. All the investigator in 
this field needs to do is to name the function he is measuring and 
specify the conditions under which the act is taking place. The 
function studied may be bricklaying, typewriting, multiplying 
subvoeally or any other function, and we may be as painstaking 
as we please about the care with which we specify the conditions 
under which such functions are exercised. For example, we may 
specify that the individual is multiplying one four-place number 
by another without being allowed to use pencil or paper or to put 
the numbers down in any way or to'speak aloud or move from his 
chair or eat or sleep until ten hours of such work has been accom- 
plished. We may still further specify by saying that he performs 
this work with eyes closed and with ears and nose plugged up 
and that after he has worked for five hours such and such a drug 
is administered. In bricklaying, for example, we may be as care- 
ful as we please about describing the kind of bricks the mason 
lays, the kind of mortar he uses, tHe kind of structure he is build- 
ing, how far he has to stoop for his brick or mortar, what his 
family situation is, the wage he receives and similar conditions. 
When we have described the function being investigated, the con- 
ditions surrounding the worker and the method of measuring the 
function, we would then describe what the standard of efficiency 
is and how it was obtained and then state the effect the various 
control factors had upon the quantity and quality of the output.t   
+It is quite another problem but again worth while to specify the con- 
dition of the worker from time to time. For example, at the end of the 
fourth hour he may have become dizzy, nauseated or complained of a head- 
ache. The position we take here is not at all incompatible with studying 
the individual’s organic condition from moment to moment or even with 
recording his verbal complaints.

372 PSYCHOLOGY 
The situation is thus not different in studying human functions 
from what it would be if we were studying activity in animals. 
The point we would make in doing behavior work is to leave 
out of discussion all of those factors which are not touched or 
approached by the problem in hand, for example, what possible 
good does it do when discussing bricklaying or subvocal arithmetic 
to guess at what goes on in the synapse, in the efferent or afferent 
leg of the reflex are or in the muscle itself? These are all worth- 
while problems, but they belong in the realm of physiology and 
this section of physiology has not yet been written. In preceding 
chapters we have given brief summaries of the few facts on the 
effect of continuous exercise of the nerve fiber, nerve cell and 
muscle concerning which there is some agreement. The total 
known facts are pitifully meagre. For students of behavior to 
devote hundreds and thousands (literally) of pages to the 
“physiological aspect’’ of fatigue problems tends in no way to 
the advancement of the study. The subject of the effect of 
continued use of the nervous system should be left to the neuro- 
physiologists or, better, to the joint work of the psychologists 
who will do the behavior work and the neuro-physiologists who 
will examine the nervous and muscular structures. 
THE CurvE oF Work. 
‘General Considerations——Assuming that a function is any 
well-established habit like that of typewriting, billiard playing - 
or subvocal arithmetic, the question next arising in measuring 
the quantity or output of work done and its quality is whether 
there are well-marked fiuctuations or rhythms or bursts of speed 
during the exercise of the function or whether the only marked 
change is the slow decrease in the output and possibly increase 
in errors due to the effect of continuous exercise. There is rather 
a persistent popular view that there are such fluctuations. In 
certain laboratories these views have apparently been confirmed. 
It is stated that there is (1) an initial spurt, (2) an end spurt 
and (3) a warming up or adaptation period. 
In the (1) initial spurt it is assumed that the-worker keyed 
up for his task assumes an initial rate of speed which cannot be
-P-A-G-E-385
THE ORGANISM AT WORK 373 
maintained. Thorndike tested this matter by recording the work 
done by several subjects in subvocal multiplication and in written 
addition. These subjects were educated adults working continu- 
ously for approximately two hours. In general, there was no 
initial spurt. It was found that the curve of work varied in each 
individual from day to day and that if any one were interested 
in proving an initial rise he could pick out occasionally a curve 
which would show it; but no spurt was characterstic of any of the 
workers when the several curves gathered from several days’ 
works were examined. In Kraepelin’s laboratory the initial spurt 
was rather a constant occurrence and was supposed to endure 
for approximately five minutes. A very recent study of Chapman 
and Nolan tends to confirm the older view of Kraepelin rather 
than that of Thorndike. Subjects were tested in continuous 
addition for 16 minutes on 7 successive occasions. They found 
definite evidence of an initial spurt in beginning the work, with 
a high percentage of errors. The speed was so great that no 
system of penalties for errors could cause this spurt to disappear. 
The spurt was of short duration, the subject always taking on a 
higher rate than he could possibly maintain. ‘‘He very rapidly 
settles down to a normal rate at which he can work for long 
periods. It is the rapidity of this decrease in efficiency which 
has led to the fact that initial spurt has been overlooked and 
even denied.’’ Thorndike again in his most recent work finds 
an absence of initial spurt. 
In regard to (2) ‘‘end spurt,’’ the evidence shows in many 
cases that there is a slight increase in the output in the last few 
minutes of work where the subject is working against time and 
has been informed beforehand that the work is to cease after a 
specified number of minutes. Book in his study of typewriting 
where ten-minute periods of work were used shows that the last 
three minutes are slightly better than any previous three minutes, 
the output standing in the relation of 100, 101, 102. Arai’s last 
ten minutes of work (twelve hours continuous work) on sub- 
vocal arithmetic (page 875) was done at a slightly faster rate 
than any rate attained in the previous half hour. The end spurt 
though real under such conditions is not an important factor
-P-A-G-E-386
374 PSYCHOLOGY 
in the curve of work. There is only very slight evidence to show 
that spurts occur after interruptions or disturbances or that they 
secur after momentary periods of decreased efficiency. 
The curve illustrating the output of the exercise of any given 
function is said by some to show a gradual increase in efficiency 
from the moment of starting (or slightly later, at the end of the 
decline following after the ‘‘initial spurt’’) up to the end of 
the first twenty to thirty minutes; to stay at this high level for 
a definite time and then to show a decline. This is called the (3) 
‘‘warming-up’’ period. It is sometimes asserted that there is 
a slower and more permanent improvement running parallel with 
the warming-up phase but enduring for a longer time. This is

Fic. 65.—Curve showing the gradual increase in time required to multiply (subyocal) one four-place number by another. The work was done continuously from 11 A.M. to 11 p.m. The times of solving the first example on each of the four days are averaged, giving the first point in the curve; the times of solving the second examples on each of the four days are similarly averaged, giving the second point on the curve. This procedure was repeated to the sixty-seventh example, which was the number completed on each day. The curve was constructed by the author from Dr, Arai’s tables. It is not corrected for errors. The vertical line gives time in minutes; the horizontal line, the number of examples. Had the time of completing each example not increased—that is, if the function had not decreased in efficiency—the curve would have remained parallel to the base line; as it is, the curve, allowing for slight fluctuations, remains constant for the first ten examples, then declines and remains constant on this higher level to the 34th example, then declines sharply and continuously (with fluctuations) to the 48th example, then improves markedly to the 61st example, then again declines. 
called the ‘‘adaptation’’ process. Experimental confirmation 
for these changes is not at hand. An examination of the curve 
illustrating Dr. Arai’s work (Fig. 65) shows the absence of such 
asserted improvement. Where there is apparent evidence for 
it the changes noted seem to be due to a period of improvement 
by practice in the function (actual learning). Where the function 
tested is a thoroughly grounded one the phenomenon is lacking. 
There is no very satisfactory experimentation upon the curve 
of work illustrating strictly manual functions. In baseball, track 
and crew work a process of limbering up or preliminary practice

is universally indulged in and is apparently necessary. Prob- 
ably no manager of a baseball team would risk sending a pitcher 
in without giving him an opportunity to work up a sweat and 
to break in his arm. Possibly the main beneficial result comes 
from increased glandular action: the muscular area in operation 
in such functions is very great and the consumption of food is 
large, hence the by-products of activity are enormous. The need 
of adrenin for breaking up and releasing the stored glycogen and 
inducing better circulation seems essential. Where the muscular 
area in operation is small, as in laryngeal work, the warming up 
period is not essential. 
A great deal of speculation has been indulged in in regard to 
the lack of ‘‘fatigue,’’ so-called, in a laryngeal function as con- 
trasted with its very. rapid appearance in manual work. Arai 
continued to work in subvocal arithmetic for a period of twelve 
hours with a decrease in efficiency possibly of not more than 25 
per cent. No crew working as rapidly as possible could continue 
its rowing beyond/a few miles with only a similar loss in efficiency. 
In view of the difference in the size of the muscular areas involved 
in the two types of work, the findings are in line with prediction. 
Subvocal Arithmetical Functions Continuously Used.— 
One of the most thorough investigations yet made upon the meas- 
urement of a function continuously exercised for a long period 
of time is that of Dr. Arai in subvocal arithmetic. Having by 
frequent practice reached the point where practice effects had 
almost disappeared, she worked on four days from 11 a.m. to 11 
P.M. at multiplying four-place numbers by four-place numbers 
without extraneous aid. During the multiplication, the two 
four-place numbers (for example, X 2543 ) were not in sight but 
were referred to when necessary. The multiplication took place 
with eyes closed. The only rest taken was the few seconds re- 
quired to write down the answer and to learn the next problem. 
The work involved in making a single such calculation is for most 
people stupendous or even impossible. Approximately’17 sets, 
4 examples in each set, were done during the 12 hours’ continu- 
ous work. The whole table cannot be reproduced, but we can 
}

compare the average time of solving the first set of 4 examples 
each day with the average of the last set of 4 as follows: 
Average time in min- 
utes of solving first First day Second day Third day Fourth day 
4 examples ...... 23.6 20.7 19.3 16.5 
Average time in min- 
utes of solving last 
4 examples ...... 62.1 44.4 49.1 32.9 
It probably would be fairer to compare the average time of solv- 
ing the first two sets of four examples (8 examples) with the 
average time of solving the last two sets of four. 
First 8 examples .... 46.9 45.2 358 461 
Last 8 examples ..... 101.1 96.4 99.1 78.5 
An examination of the tables shows that there is a loss in effi- 
ciency as measured by the increase in time of solving the last 8 
examples. The average increase in time for, the last eight ex- 
amples over the first 8 examples on the 4 days\was 119 per cent. 
While at first sight this loss in efficiency may seem large, a little 
consideration will convince us that the efficiency\ of the function 
even after 12 hours’ continuous work was still very high. Dr. 
Arai thus required.a little over twice as long to perform one such 
example at the end of the 12 hours’ work as at the beginning. 
Even at the end she was performing a feat which could not be 
equaled probably by two persons out of a thousand engaged in 
arithmetical work. The second most important point coming 
from this research was the fact that the normal period of sleep 
completely restored the function as shown by the fact that the 
average time of solving the first four examples on each of the 
four days is about equal. As a matter of fact, there is a decrease 
in time which looks like a practice effect. The author has taken 
the figures of Miss Arai and plotted the curve given above, Fig. 65 
(withext correction for error). She worked four days and did 67 
problems on each day. The points on the curve were obtained 
as follows: The times of solving all first problems (that is, the 
times 0* solving the first problems on each of the four days) were 
————tt—=tsSI

THE ORGANISM AT WORK 377 
averaged ; this gives the first point on the curve. Then the times 
of solving all second problems were similarly averaged to obtain 
the second point on the curve. This procedure was repeated for 
all 67 points. The curve shows in the main an increase of time. 
The first 10 problems show only individual fluctuations; then 
occurs a slight decline. From that point to the 34th, the function 
is maintained at fairly uniform efficiency but with upward and 
downward fluctuations. From the 34th example to the 48th 
there is a marked decline in efficiency. From the 48th to the 
61st a marked improvement occurs, then a fall in efficiency 
extending to the 65th, and finally a slight rise. 
It would take us beyond the limits of this discussion to present 
all the data which has been collected upon this type of work. 
Such functions as the following have been tested: Writing sen- 
tences from dictation, learning nonsense syllables and digits, 
translating, marking words containing @ and ¢ and selecting titles 
for a bibliography. The interesting point about all of the results 
is that such functions can be exercised continuously for several 
hours without severe loss in efficiency. 
Continuous Exercise of Manual Functions.—No careful 
measurement of the loss in efficiency in a manual function due to 
continuous exercise, comparable with Dr. Arai’s work, has been 
made. That the loss is more rapid in manual work every one 
admits. Furthermore, short periods of rest seem to be advan- 
tageous in manual functions, whereas they are certainly not 
necessary and possibly disadvantageous in subvocal functions. 
Many of the experiments have been made upon the ergograph 
where a single group of muscles is singled out and made to work 
continuously in a way in which no daily task ever employs them. 
This work we summarized on page 183. It is a most unsatisfac- 
tory way to study the curve of work in manual functions. 
In the factories loss of efficiency in manual functions as 
measured in terms of decreased output is being studied with 
some care. We quote the following, which appeared in The 
Iron Age: 
““ At these works there was recently constructed a long incline 
up which heavy loads were to be wheeled in barrows, and pre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-390
378 PSYCHOLOGY 
miums were offered to the men who did or exceeded a certain 
amount of this labor. They attempted it vigorously, but none 
succeeded in earning any of the extra money ; instead, they all fell 
considerably below the fixed task. 
“‘Prompt investigation by an expert disclosed that the trouble 
lay in the fact that the men were working without sufficiently 
frequent periods of rest. Thereupon, a foreman was stationed 
by a clock, and every twelve minutes he blew a whistle. At the 
sound every barrowman stopped where he was, sat down on his 
barrow, and rested for three minutes. The first hour after that 
was done showed a remarkable change for the better in accom- 
plishment; the second day the men all made the premium allow- 
ance by doing more than what had been too much; and on the 
third day the minimum compensation had risen, on the average, 
40 per cent., with no complaints of overdriving from any of 
the force.’’ 
This illustrates the fact that where the task is severe there 
is a growing tendency to allow a short period of rest after 
definite intervals of work. The whole question of decrease in 
the quantity and quality of output is bound up in daily life with 
a great many emotional factors such as whether the man’s pay 
is sufficient to afford him an outlet for play, marriage and the 
like; one’s personal and family adjustment ; political convictions; 
the sociological theories the worker may have; open- and closed- 
shop policies; and most important probably, the rate at which 
the individual works. The heart teaches us a lesson. The heart 
functions continuously from the beginning of the third month 
of foetal life to death but at such a rate and with such a rest 
period between functions that its efficiency is uniformly main- 
tained. While not very much of value on the problem of effi- 
ciency in manual functions has yet come from a psychological 
laboratory, the solution has to be sought there, since work in the 
shop and in commercial houses generally cannot be controlled in 
such a way as to yield very safe results. But the type of work 
which the laboratory undertakes will have to be considerably 
broadened in scope. Our own view is that many of the basal 
laws can be established by using animals. We can force the
-P-A-G-E-391
  
THE ORGANISM AT WORK 379 
animal to form very much more complicated habits than would 
appear from our ordinary laboratory studies. If punishment is 
used instead of food, the stimulating value of the situation as a 
whole would probably not decline very much from hour to hour. 
Given such a set of functions in animals, it would be possible to 
vary the conditions, such as underfeeding, undersleeping and the 
administration of drugs, and note the effect of the varying con- 
ditions upon the efficiency of the function under observation. 
Physiological Aspects of the Continuous Exercise of a 
Function.—In previous chapters we have discussed certain phases 
of the physiological findings in regard to the effect of continuous 
works as follows: Chemical changes occurring in a nerve fiber due 
to continuous stimulation (page 137); structural and chemical 
changes in nerve cells (page 137) ; chemical and form changes in 
muscle due to work (page 184) ; effect of adrenin upon the prod- 
ucts formed by continuous activity of the muscle (page 243). 
We briefly summarize these findings again: The question as to 
whether there are any structural and chemical changes in the 
nerve fiber due to continued functioning is still in doubt. The 
question of the changes in the nerve cell is even more problem- 
atical {in general, form, size and chemical changes are believed to 
occur, but the amount of exercise of the function necessary to 
bring about such changes is tremendously large. | The products 
of muscular activity are slightly better known: there is the elim- 
ination of CO, in greater amounts when the muscle is active than 
when inactive; lactic acid is formed and possibly potassium 
phosphate. These products of activity get into the blood stream, 
are carried to muscles which have not been active and decrease 
the amount of work they are capable of doing. In regard to the 
influence of adrenin, it is stated that due to the increased supply 
of blood to the muscles such products are rapidly washed out 
or else neutralized in situ.

General Considerations.—Several factors should be taken 
into account in the discussion of experimentation and measure- — 
 
-P-A-G-E-392

ment of any function: & ) only in rare cases has a function been 
practiced sufficiently in laboratory studies before controlled tests 
were introduced to gauge the effects of drugs, continuous exer- 
cise, loss of sleep and other factors, In other words, the subject 
improves in skill through practice—this may mask the effects of a 
drug or the loss of sleep or continuous exercise. Hither the fune- 
tion should be practiced to the point where no improvement can 
be observed before control tests are introduced or else a meas- 
urement of the improvement factor should be found. (2 The 
situation for the worker in such experiments is not normal. He 
is being tested under unusual conditions, and emotional factors 
with their reinforcing or inhibiting effects may enter in.) This 
has vitiated many experiments upon alcohol, tobacco and caffeine 
especially. To eliminate this effect various devices may be used. 
The subject may be told that ‘he is being given caffeine in a cap- 
sule, whereas only flour or meal may be given; or he may be told 
that he is being given alcohol and some other masked non-alco- 
holie substance is actually given. On the other hand, he may be 
told nothing, the experimenter depending upon his own ability 
to introduce the control substance or condition in such a way 
that the subject is not able to note whether the drug or control 
factor has been administered. Rivers first emphasized the im- 
portance of the emotional aspect of such experimental conditions, 
and efficiency experiments may be said to start with his work in 
1906. ({3) Too narrow functions have been studied—rarely has 
any of the work been done upon functions used in daily life. ) As 
an example, we may mention the fact that in the great mass of 
experimentation upon manual functions the ergograph has been 
used. [(4) The functions have been followed through for entirely 
too short periods for wide generalizations to be made. 
In the summary of the literature which follows these factors 
should be taken into consideration and the results cited should be 
looked upon as being merely provisional. 
Alcohol.—On account of various partisans for and against 
the use of alcohol, it is difficult to obtain unequivocal data upon 
this subject. The following summary presents the unparti- 
san view of most scientific men who have taken up the study 
 
-P-A-G-E-393
  THE ORGANISM AT WORK 381 
of alcohol from a psychological and physiological standpoint. 
1. There is a wide range of individual variation in the ability 
of different people to consume alcohol without showing its effect 
upon their curve of work. The amount may vary from 20 e¢.c. 
to 40 ¢.c. of absolute alcohol (a very much heavier dose than is 
usually taken for purely social purposes). 
2. The effect of alcohol upon all reflexes when any is noted 
is depressing. This has been confirmed by many investigators 
working upon the patellar reflex, reflex eye movements and others. 
3. The effect of aleohol when taken in large quantities on the 
amount and quality of muscular work which can be done is 
deleterious, according to most observers. Some hold that the bad 
effect upon muscular work can be observed for many hours after 
the alcohol has been consumed. On the effect of small doses of 
alcohol Rivers has the following to say: 
“‘T may now sum up the general results which have so far 
been reached. In the case of muscular work, we have seen that 
there is definite evidence that small doses, varying from 5 to 20 
c.c. of absolute alcohol, have no effect on the amount or nature 
of the work performed with the ergograph, either immediately 
or within several hours of their administration, the results pre- 
viously obtained by other workers being almost certainly due to 
defects of experimental method. With a larger dose of 40 c.c., 
there was evidence—in one case, at least—-of an increase in the 
amount of work under the influence of the substance; but the 
increase was uncertain and inconstant, and the possibility cannot 
be excluded that it was due to disturbing factors. With larger 
doses than 40 ¢.c., we have the work of Hellsten, showing a decided 
falling off in the amount of work with a dose of 80 grammes.”’ 
The effect upon language functions is not clear. They are 
undoubtedly less affected than are manual habits. Dodge, in his 
recent study, has shown that the more complex functions, such 
as memory and thinking, show less effect under the administra- 
tion of alcohol than do the simple reflexes, although when any 
effect is noticeable it is one of depression. This seems to contra- 
diet the popular view, since it is a matter of common observation 
that in certain social situations, such as a dinner party, afternoon
-P-A-G-E-394
    382 PSYCHOLOGY 
tea or wedding, conversation becomes accelerated when alcohol 
is consumed.? The situation here is quite complex. The depres- 
sive effect seems to be focalized in the cortical centers, thus leay- 
ing the segmental speech connections without cortical control. 
‘When larger amounts of alcohol are consumed the cord centers 
become affected and conversation declines, the company becomes 
dull and depression of all functions can be observed. 
4. On the biological side the results are not very clear. Psy- 
chopathology shows that many feeble-minded and psychopathic 
children are born of alcoholic parents. The question here, though, 
is whether the parents were not psychopathic before becoming 
alcoholic. Alcoholism may be merely one form in which the 
neurotic tendencies show themselves. It is questionable whether 
a sturdy individual free from hereditary stigmata could ever be- 
come alcoholic. So many normal interests would come in con- 
flict with the excessive use of alcohol that it is almost unthinkable 
that a healthy man could sink his cares and worries in that. form 
of oblivion. Experiments upon animals are again not wholly 
conclusive. Stockard’s work on the guinea-pig represents one 
side, Pearl’s experiments on the domestic fowl represent the other. 
The former found that if guinea-pigs were forced to breathe alco- 
hol fumes for long periods of time the progeny of such individ- 
uals was born with a large number of abnormalities, and the 
tenure of life was shortened. Furthermore, the f, generation 
still showed the evil effects. Pearl, on the other hand, found 
almost the opposite effect upon domestic fowls. The egg-laying   
? While possibly no good physiological reason can be.assigned for it, the 
different forms of alcohol seem to produce differences in the liveliness of a 
given company. The consumption of the same amount of grain alcohol at a 
social gathering will not produce the same effect as will an equal amount 
of alcohol in the form of champagne or a cocktail. The liveliness which 
ensues during social functions is not wholly due by any means to the alcohol 
which is taken. While the dinner as a whole might be a failure without it, 
the primary effect of the alcohol is probably to bring about an increased 
glandular activity which raises rapidly the general emotional level of the 
individuals partaking of it. This is pure speculation, since the author 
knows of no work which tests the effects of alcohol upon internal secre- 
tions. All that we argue for here is that the sight of the wine or cocktail 
may start conditioned secretion reflexes, 
 
-P-A-G-E-395
  
THE ORGANISM AT WORK 383 
capacity was possibly increased and the fertility of the eggs was 
in no way decreased, nor were any evil effects noticed upon 
the young. 
Certainly no experimental work, either upon humans or 
animals, has shown that the consumption of alcohol in small 
amounts when taken after the working period of the day is over 
produces any evil effect either upon the individual or upon his 
progeny. Certain statistics have been advanced by life insurance 
companies which would seem to controvert this statement. These 
mortality tables seem to show that even the occasional drinker 
has a shorter span of life than the total abstainer. These state- 
ments have been called into serious question by statisticians of 
the highest character who are interested only in the mathematical 
side of the problem and not in the good or bad effects of alcohol. 
In the opinion of a great many people, the following state- 
ments seem to be reasonable: (1) That the only sane thing to do 
is to keep alcohol from children during the growing and ado- 
lescent periods, not because experiment has shown that small 
amounts will injure them but because there may be a risk and 
the risk is not worth while since the child is in no need of relax- 
ation from work. (2) That the distribution of alcohol is not 
(or rather was not) very wisely handled. The saloon is gen- 
erally recognized as an unwholesome institution because it pro- 
vides a loafing place for individuals out of work, keeps the 
working-man from his home, encourages drink during the work- 
ing hours of the day and because of the fact that undesirable 
characters very often frequent it. The more reasonable mem- 
bers of the community feel that if the saloon could be eradicated 
and the sale of high-proof liquors stopped, then the lighter wines 
and beer could be consumed in small amounts in the evening 
after the working period is done with no detriment to the race 
as a whole. The advantage they urge from such a handling of 
the alcoholic situation is the relaxation which a small amount 
of alcohol brings. The concept of relaxation is a growing one 
and people realize that when the day’s work is done some form 
of relaxation is advantageous. No man to-day of any thought- 
fulness will tell you that he takes his quota of alcohol to increase 
 
-P-A-G-E-396
384 PSYCHOLOGY 
his output of muscular work or to increase his ability to write 
or think clearly. They frankly admit that when they have a 
definite and delicate job to do they want to be free from the 
effects of alcohol. On the other hand, they give as their reason 
for drinking that when they come home tired, from their work 
or worn out with business and professional cares they want to 
be freed from them as rapidly as possible and that aleohol brings 
the needed relaxation. They state that they can become, through 
the effects of a cocktail or a glass of wine, a social rather than an 
unsocial being, that this aids them in putting aside the daily 
grind and entering into their family life and social relations gen- 
erally with greater rapidity. They argue further that since no 
experimental work has ever shown that the amount of alcohol 
they consume has any detrimental effect upon their character or 
ability to work on the following day, they see no reason why 
they should not continue to live as they have in the past. 
Regardless of what scientific results may show and what the 
opinion of the small consumer of alcohol may be, the laws of the 
country have decided that the manufacture and sale of alcohol 
must be eliminated. The prediction of the outcome of this ex- 
periment is more difficult than most people imagine. Relaxation 
as we pointed out above, will be obtained in one way or another. 
Whether the outlet will take place along sane lines, as smoking 
clubs, coffee houses, greater outside exercise; or along lines far 
more pernicious than alecohol—for example, in some form of 
drug consumption or in greater sex freedom—remains to 
be decided. 
If one examines the history of races, the fact appears that 
the stronger nations have always been the largest consumers of 
alcohol and have used the most varied forms of it. That alcohol 
has had any serious effect upon the efficiency of the French, 
English, Scandinavian, German and Austrian nations cannot be 
put forth seriously. The argument is often made that Russia’s 
present condition is due to the large consumption of alcoholic 
drinks. A more reasonable view is that their education is so 
poor, their outlets for social relaxation so limited and their 
climate so severe that they have learned to use alcohol as an
-P-A-G-E-397
eT LT eee eR ne a oe BN Nan aaa 
THE ORGANISM AT WORK 385 
anesthetic. With better social conditions alcohol would no longer 
be used as the only source of relaxation. 
Effect of Caffeine.—Caffeine is the active principle in tea, 
coffee and many soda fountain drinks. Its effects upon various 
functions have been tested by many investigators. The studies of 
Rivers and of Hollingworth are most important. The former 
worked largely with the ergograph and with typewriting. Rivers’ 
general conclusions are as follows: 
“The general practical conclusions to be drawn from the 
experiments which I have recorded, and from those of previous 
workers, is that caffeine increases the capacity for both muscular 
and mental work, this stimulating action persisting for a con- 
siderable time after the substance has been taken without there 
being any evidence, with moderate doses, of reaction leading to 
a diminished capacity for work, the substance thus really dimin- 
ishing and not merely obscuring the effects of fatigue.”’ 
Hollingworth’s experiments were made upon a somewhat 
more pretentious scale. He kept his subjects guarded as to the 
outside work they did and the amount of food and rest taken. 
Several subjects were used who worked, except for the drug in- 
troduced, under normal conditions. The test lasted forty days. 
Tests of speed of movement (tapping), motor codrdination and 
steadiness were made. There was an increase in the speed of 
movement which depended somewhat upon the size of the dose. 
The amount of caffeine given varied from 2 to 6 grains. The 
effect. was noted usually within the hour after taking the drug 
(Rivers states that it is often noticeable within 15 minutes) and 
lasted usually from 1 to 4 hours. No secondary depresssion, as 
was pointed out by Rivers, occurred within 72 hours. This is 
unusual, since such depressions usually follow after the exciting 
phase of a stimulant has worn off. In regard to motor codrdina- 
tion, Hollingworth states that small doses increase efficiency, 
whereas large doses, from 4 to 6 grains, decrease it. The steadi- 
ness test shows that slight tremor occurs with doses of 1 to 4 
grains. The tremor appears after several hours. Larger doses 
increase the tremor and hasten its onset. Other functions were 
observed under the drug: association tests such as the naming
-P-A-G-E-398
  386 PSYCHOLOGY 
of colors and the giving of opposites of certain words. Caffeine 
doses of every size increased efficiency in such functions, the in- 
erease lasting from 3 to 7 hours. In such activities as the can- 
cellation of letters and numbers, reacting with the right hand to 
a blue paper and with the left hand to a red one, small doses 
produced retardation, large doses acceleration.? The effect of 
caffeine upon typewriting was most carefully studied. The speed 
of performance was quickened by small doses and retarded by 
large. On the other hand, the quality of performance as meas- 
ured by the number of errors, both corrected and uncorrected, 
was improved by doses of all sizes. 
Caffeine also comes under the head of ‘‘habit-forming drugs.”’ 
Headache and general restlessness ensue if the subject is de- 
prived of its use. No laboratory work touches the influence of 
caffeine on daily routine. One needs only to observe the behavior 
of the ordinary human being before and after his cup of coffee is 
taken in the morning, or of the tired hunter or soldier after the 
day’s work is over, to gain some idea of the general stimulating 
effect. of coffee and tea. It is interesting to speculate upon the 
number of scientific books and papers that have been written 
with the aid and supporting effect of caffeine. 
Tobacco.—While experimentation in this field is in its in- 
fancy, the results, if taken at their face value, show a deleterious 
effect upon efficiency. One of the earliest experiments was made 
by Lombard in 1892, who found, measuring the amount of work 
done on the ergograph, that one cigar enormously decreased the 
output. The effect passed off rapidly after the cigar was finished, 
but the function was not completely restored until more than an 
hour after the cigar was laid aside. Several others have partly 
confirmed the results of Lombard, finding, however, that the 
effect was not so marked. Féré found that cigarette smoking 
produced an increase in the output of work, if the test was made 
five minutes after the cigarette was smoked. <A decrease in the 
amount of work followed rapidly. If the test was not made until   
*It seems unfortunate that this author with unlimited facilities at his 
disposal should have selected so many narrow, functions for observation 
and functions which mean so little even when accurately measured. 
 
-P-A-G-E-399
  
THE ORGANISM AT WORK 387 
fifteen minutes after smoking, the effect was deleterious on the 
function from the start. Rivers found a slight decrease in work 
done (ergograph) on days when cigars were smoked as con- 
trasted with that done on days when cigars were not smoked (2 
days with smoking were contrasted in one subject with 3 days 
without smoking and in another subject 2 days with smoking 
with 2 days without). The decrease in efficiency was very small. 
Bush has recently made an extensive series of tests upon the 
effect of smoking upon laryngeal functions such as subtraction, 
free and controlled association and memory. The tests were 
first given to obtain a standard. The subject then smoked for 
15 minutes, after which the tests were repeated. In most cases 
the effect was deleterious, the average loss being 10.6 per cent. 
The smoking of non-tobacco material (cubebs) likewise produced 
a reduction of efficiency of 4.2 per cent., which is rather aston- 
ishing in view of the fact that such extra afferent stimulation 
should, other things being equal, facilitate the output. 
The experimental results on tobacco are thus very meagre. 
If any conclusion can be drawn it is that its effect is depressing 
upon the function studied. Prohibition of smoking among men 
undergoing training for athletic contests reflects this. 
Tobacco, of course, is another ‘‘habit-forming drug.’? To 
those addicted to its use no such experiments as the above can 
be convineing. If deprived of their smoke their efficiency in all 
functions for the time being, at least, remains at a low ebb (they 
spend their time in restless roving). The argument of the 
smoker is that it is his form of relaxation and that no slight loss 
in efficiency of so temporary a character can be weighed in the 
scalé against the use of tobacco. If the anti-tobacco propagan- 
dists had succeeded in prohibiting the use of tobacco in the Army 
in the recent war it is difficult to tell what the effect would have 
been upon the morale of the men. Under emotional strain it 
forms a relatively safe outlet which for the smoker, at any rate, 
is essential. 
Strychnine.—The effect of strychnine on habit functions has 
not surely been determined. Jones, administering strychnine by 
the mouth in large (4.2 milligrammes of hydrochloride of strych-  
-P-A-G-E-400
388 PSYCHOLOGY 
nine) and in small doses (1.8 milligrammes) found that the drug 
produced an obvious effect upon the amount of work which could 
be done on the ergograph. There was with large doses a rise 
in the amount of work and then a gradual fall. The rise for the 
smaller doses was less rapid and the decline took place more 
slowly. There is thus a general increase in efficiency followed by 
a decrease—the total output being less. 
Poffenberger in a recent experiment found no effect from 
doses ranging from 1/30 to 1/20 grain upon steadiness and 
accuracy in speed of movement. No effect was observed upon a 
series of other functions involving largely language organization. 
Jones’ observations were made under the direction of Rivers; 
they are, accordingly, probably accurate in so far as ergographic 
experiments can be made so. The reason for Poffenberger’s fail- 
ure to find any effect. was possibly due to the difficulty in ad- 
ministering a suitable dose for the particular subjects tested. Of 
course, the same functions were not tested, but this hardly ae- 
counts for the complete lack of harmony in the two investigations. 
Strychnine, of course, is a dangerous drug and should be 
experimented with only under the direction of a physician. 
Cocaine.—There is fairly general agreement obtained from 
the scattering experimental work done upon this demoralizing 
and dangerous drug. Its immediate effect is to largely increase 
the efficiency of the function being tested (usually the ergo- 
graph) ; there is later, of course, a very strongly marked de- 
pression. The interesting fact about the drug is that its effect 
is quickly noticeable in states bordering upon almost complete 
exhaustion. It is stated that the natives of South America are 
enabled to perform great feats of endurance owing to its effect, 
and to withstand severe hunger and thirst under its influence 
(Rivers). On account of the relaxation it brings and the rapid 
ensuing temporary improvement in practically all functions it 
has become a favorite with drug addicts. That there is a marked 
increase in its use is admitted by every one. One cannot help but 
see in this drug a possible but unfortunate escape for those who 
have become really addicted to the use of alcohol.

Errect oF CLIMATE AND OTHER Factors Upon THE CuRVE 
or Work. 
Ventilation—Recent work has upset the older notions con- 
cerning the effect of poor ventilation upon the curve of work. 
The older view was that in crowded, humid, hot rooms the increase 
of CO, in the air, the decrease in the percentage of oxygen and 
the expired organic matter (‘‘anthropotoxin’’) were responsible 
for the ill effects observed. Pure air contains about 21 per cent. 
of oxygen, 78 per cent. of nitrogen and 0.03 per cent. of carbon- 
dioxide. In crowded, ill-ventilated factories and schools oxygen 
may be reduced to 19 per cent. and the carbon-dioxide increased to 
0.3 per cent. But these changes in the air’s constituents are too 
slight to produce physiological disturbance. The general changes 
observed upon subjects sitting or working in poorly ventilated, 
hot, humid rooms are drowsiness, lassitude, fainting, flushed face, 
hot skin, sweating, with complaints of headache and various other 
ills. That these changes are not due to the lack of oxygen and to 
the increase of CO, is proved by the fact that if such individuals 
while working in the same poorly ventilated rooms are allowed to 
breathe fresh outside air through a tube they are not restored 
to normal. The moment, however, the temperature and humidity 
are lowered, especially at the surface of the body, as can be done 
by stirring the air with a fan, the disturbances disappear, al- 
though no fresh air is introduced. In various ways it has been 
shown that the optimum conditions for work are 68° F., 50 per 
cent. relative humidity and 45 cubic feet of outside air per person 
per minute. Under such an optimum all general bodily disturb- 
ances are at a minimum. 
These changes in the bodily condition of the subject due to 
poor ventilation, while they are stimuli that are usually nega- 
tively reacted to by most members of the human race, do not 
necessarily interfere with the possibility of efficient work. The 
question then arises, suppose we make the work, either through 
money, social approval, or fear, of high stimulating value, can 
the subject do as much manual and laryngeal work as under 
the optimum conditions for work? In manual functions all re- 
cent experiments show that there is loss in efficiency in poorly
-P-A-G-E-402
390 PSYCHOLOGY 
ventilated, crowded rooms. When the temperature and humidity 
are raised there is a falling off in efficiency in such functions as 
running a bicycle ergometer which indicates the exact foot- 
pounds of work accomplished and in the manipulation of dumb- 
bells. The efficiency at the optimum condition is 37 per cent. 
greater than at 86° F. and 15 per cent. greater than at 75° F. 
In regard to laryngeal work and combined laryngeal and 
manual work, that is, in all functions where the muscular area 
involved is small, there seems to be little or no loss in efficiency 
due to even marked upward variations from the optimum. The 
following functions have been studied: Cancellation, naming of 
opposites, color naming, written addition, subvocal multiplica- 
tion, learning to typewrite, grading of handwriting, and grading 
of English composition. Thorndike, in summarizing the work 
done at the laboratory of the New York State Commission on. 
Ventilation, has the following to say: 
With the forms of work and lengths of period used, we find 
that when an individual is urged to do his best he does as much, 
and does it: as well, and improves as rapidly, in a hot, humid, 
stale, and stagnant air condition (86° F., 80 per cent. relative 
humidity, with no air or only re-circulated air, and with no move- 
ment of the air save what is caused by events in the room and, in 
the case of re-circulation, by the re-cireulating force) as in an 
optimum condition (68° F., 50 per cent. rel. hum., 45 cu. ft. per 
person per minute of outside air introduced). This result was 
obtained when the individuals were subjected to the bad condi- 
tions 4 hours a day for five consecutive days. Enough individuals 
were tested to make the result entirely reliable. 
We find further that when an individual is given work to 
do that is of no interest or value to him and is deprived even of 
means of telling how well he does do it, and is in other ways 
tempted to relax standards and do work of a poor quality, he 
still shows no inferiority in the quality of the product produced 
in stagnant air at 86°, 80 per cent. r. h., with 30 to 40 parts of 
CO, per 10,000, he being subjected to this condition for 8 hours 
a day for four successive days, and tested on the second, third, 
and fourth day. There is some evidence that he spends more 
time on the work, but even this is not certain. 
Finally, we find that when an individual is left to his (or 
her) own choice as to whether he shall do mental work or read
-P-A-G-E-403
  
THE ORGANISM AT WORK 391 
stories, rest, talk, or sleep, he does as much work per hour when 
the temperature is 75° as when it is 68°. In the experiments on 
this topic, temperature alone was varied, other air conditions 
being kept constant. The reason for this limitation was the 
apparent absence in all experiments to date, of any physiological 
effect due to staleness of the air as shown by high CO, content. 
The smaller difference was chosen to make the experiments suit- 
able for their main purpose as a test of certain conditions upon 
appetite, the psychological tests being in this case secondary. 
It is also the case that the effect of moderate overheating upon 
the inclination to do mental work is, in practice, more important 
than the effect of extreme heat. The two conditions (68° and 
75°) were maintained each for three successive days of seven 
hours each. 
In a very short experiment wherein the temperature was 
varied to 86° F., 80 per cent. rel. hum., there did seem to be a 
diminished inclination to do mental work, but the variability of 
results in all such experiments with optional work advises us to 
postpone any conclusions concerning the effect of very high tem- 
peratures upon. inclination until adequate experiments are made. 
Miss Stecher in further work at the laboratory of the New 
York State Commission on Ventilation has tested, several func- 
tions under low and high humidity with temperature held at a 
constant, namely, 75° F. The relative humidity in one case was 
50 per cent., in the other 20 per cent. The following functions 
were tested: Addition, aiming, hand steadiness, tapping, type- 
writing, arm steadiness, mirror tracing, ‘‘industrial fatigue,” © 
reflex wink and eyelid tremor. She concludes: 
In all these tests the average improvement from the first 
described above and also the average improvement from the first 
to the last trial on any particular day, showed no reliable differ- 
ence. That is, by these tests of nervous and motor control and 
by the more purely intellectual tests we could detect’ no influence 
of excessive dryness during two weeks’ exposure or during the 
working day. 
While these results are in sharp contrast to the general view 
and seem to be opposed even to common-sense, one can but 
accept them until further tests are made. It is well to remem- 
ber that in all such tests the stimulating value of the problems 
even where alternate work is allowed is very much higher than 
  nace a
-P-A-G-E-404
392 PSYCHOLOGY | 
that offered in one’s daily routine. Furthermore, the time the 
tests occupied was extremely short for the advancing of such 
far-reaching conclusions. The human organism is built to with- 
stand and endure hardships for long periods of time. If lack of 
food for thirty days will not reduce the efficiency of the biological 
machine very greatly (page 398) nor the consumption of drugs, 
nor thirst nor loss of sleep, we should expect some such results 
as the above during the time these tests were continued. To 
generalize as many authors have done is at present not warranted. 
Thorndike has drawn an extended conclusion from the above 
work to the effect that fully as efficient work may be carried out 
in the hot, humid summer months as in the cool of winter. Such 
an extension is just about as fallacious as would be the gener- 
alization that since Agostino Levanzin improved in many 
functions and showed losses in only a few durirg a thirty-one day 
fast, one might safely encourage him to go continuously 
without food. Such generalizations, however comforting to the 
summer student, lend themselves to possible abuse by owners of 
sweatshops, cotton mills and the authorities in control of the 
schools in cities with corrupt governments. To be on the safe 
side one would have to carry out experiments upon growing 
children for long periods of time. In the absence of such ex- 
perimentation all would agree that the optimum specified is 
. still desirable. 
The Effect of Climate——The experiments showing that the 
‘discomforts’ (flushed face, dry skin or sweating, complaints 
of headache, ete.) and the loss in efficiency were due to a rise in 
temperature with increase in humidity were made after the ob- 
servations of Dexter and of Huntington on the effect of climate. 
Their observations in general are in conformity with and ex- 
plicable in the terms of the findings of the Ventilation Commis- 
sion. High winds, cloudy and rainy days seem to have a 
disturbing effect upon humanity’s daily routine. It has been 
asserted that on days when violent electrical disturbances are 
present (electric storms) humanity’s errors are increased. No 
trustworthy evidence for this assertion is at hand. 
General Effect of Oxygen Deficiency.—The effect of oxygen
-P-A-G-E-405
  THE ORGANISM AT WORK 393 
deficiency has been studied with some degree of care by the psy- 
chologists attached to the Medical Research Laboratory at Min- 
eola. It is well known that mountain climbers and pilots flying 
in high altitudes suffer seriously from lack of oxygen. In order 
to get a more or less complete picture of these changes and to 
test the individual variation in the ability to withstand such 
changes, a largq low-pressure chamber was constructed from 
which the air could be exhausted, thus reducing the oxygen 
tension’ until it could be made to correspond to the tension at any 
barometric level. After oxygen tension has been decreased to a 
certain point certain habit systems of the human individual begin 
to decline in efficiency. These effects multiply until complete 
asphyxiation occurs. If, during the onset of oxygen hunger, the 
subject is made to perform certain motor operations somewhat 
similar to those used in flying the effects will show themselves. 
In the test devised by Dunlap the subject was seated before a 
table upon which were placed 14 stimulus lamps arranged in 2 
rows of 7 each. Immediately below the lamps were 2 similarly 
arranged rows of contact buttons, each surrounded by a washer. 
If the button was touched with a stylus a green check lamp 
lighted up, but if the surrounding washer was touched a red 
error light would appear. As soon as any lamp lighted up the 
subject moved his arm and hand from a position of rest and 
touched the appropriate contact button with the stylus. The 
lighting of the small lamps was under the control of the experi- 
menter. The lamps could be made to light in any order. In addi- 
tion to having him touch the appropriate contact button he had 
to keep an ammeter reading at a certain point; the amount of 
eurrent going through the ammeter was under the control of the 
experimenter. The third thing the subject had to do was to keep 
a small motor running at low speed by rocking a foot pedal. The 
speed of the motor, also, was under the control of the experimen- 
ter. With the foot pedal in one position the motor would slow 
down. Without having the subject change his foot the ex- 
perimenter could again speed the motor up and to slow it the 
subject would have to rock the pedal to its other position. These 
acts were all very simple and could be grasped by the subject
-P-A-G-E-406
  394 PSYCHOLOGY 
after a few minutes of practice. At the same time, they kept 
him alert. After touching the light he would have to glance 
quickly at the ammeter and then back to the bank of lamps. 
The effect of oxygen hunger would show itself in fumbling, 
striking too hard or too easily with the stylus; in slowing or speed- 
ing of the reactive movements; failure to glance at the light, or 
fixating the ammeter and failing to glance at the keys, thus 
letting a light go by unreacted to; delaying reaction until he 
could not touch the contact with the stylus before the light went 
out—the light stayed on only two seconds; touching the contacts 
in the wrong row or the wrong column; staring at the light and 
making no effort to touch the contact. Finally he would allow 
the motor to run continuously at high speed; let the lights go 
by without reacting to them; and fail to adjust the ammeter. At 
this point complete incapacity had been reached. 
The effect upon established habits such as that of handwriting 
was studied by the author. <A standard psychological vocabulary 
test was used in making up the test cards. The one hundred 
words of the test were cut up, put in a hat and shuffled. As the 
words were drawn from the hat they were typewritten on a 
standard library card. By this method three (or any larger 
number) test cards of one hundred words each were obtained. 
The task of copying the cards offered the same difficulty to the 
subject, since the same words were used on each card, only the 
order being different. Since the copying of words is an old- 
established habit there was little improvement through the prac- 
tice obtained by the single writing on each of the three cards. 
The subject wrote one card at normal barometric pressure (but in 
the chamber with the motor running, oxygen tube in the mouth, 
etc.). The second card was written 15 minutes after a given ‘‘alti- 
tude’’ had been reached. Immediately after writing the (second) 
card at this altitude pure oxygen was administered from a tank 
through the mouth for two minutes. The third card was then 
handed to the subject and he was instructed to copy it. Fig. 66 
shows Capt. Davis’s normal handwriting, his handwriting at 
22,000 feet and his handwriting after breathing oxygen for two 
minutes. The records of the men undergoing this test were

It will thus be seen that handwriting and the accuracy of 
copying a list of words is seriously affected by the lack of oxygen, 
but that the administration of pure oxygen for two minutes al- 
most completely restores this function even though the subject 
remain at the height of 22,000 feet. 
These tables have been made at 14,000 feet, 16,000 feet, 18,000 
feet and 22,000 feet. While our records are not complete the 
results show that at 14,000 feet the effect of a deficient supply of 
oxygen is very slight. From this point on the various subjects 
are affected differently. Some individuals are badly affected at 
16,000 feet while others are only slightly affected at 18,000 feet. 
Beyond this point apparently every one shows loss of efficiency. 
Only one record at 22,000 feet was obtained. Two other subjects 
tested at 22,000 feet fainted before the last two records could be 
made. In every case except where fainting occurred the two 
minutes’ administration of oxygen completely restored the hand- 
writing to normal.* |   |

       THE ORGANISM AT WORK 
The Diurnal Course of Efficiency.—Several experiments 
have been carried out for the purpose of determining the relative 
course of efficiency during the day. Apparently two objects 
really have been sought: (1) to determine the time of day 
any given function can be most efficiently exercised and (2) 
to determine the spread or transfer of ‘‘fatigue’’ (influ- 
ence of continuous exercise of groups of functions upon some 
other function). 
In regard to (1) there seems to be no reliable conclusion. 
March states that in manual functions such as aiming, tapping 
and the like where both accuracy and speed are called for, the 
maximum of accuracy comes earlier in the day than speed. Hol- 
lingworth, on the contrary, finds that mere speed is at a maximum 
near the end of the day and speed with accuracy near the middle 
of the day. Gates in a variety of tests finds efficiency increasing 
in all functions from morning to noon; in the afternoon the effi- 
ciency of manual functions continues to increase, whereas the 
functions involving mainly laryngeal activity show an after- 
lunch decrease followed by a final increase. Stecher, who has most 
recently worked upon the problem, obtains still different results. 
It seems safe to say that until diet, sleep, general activity and 
certain general organic functions are kept uniform no reliable in- 
formation can be obtained upon this problem. In the animal world 
the rhythm of rest and activity can be altered by shifting the 
feeding periods. 
In regard to (2) above we can make the problem more spe- 
cific: Suppose a student in the grades or in the high school works 
steadily at a variety of school subjects from 9 to 2:30 (mainly 
laryngeal functions). Can he perform mathematical computa- 
tions at well at 9:30 a.m. as at 2p.m.? Hecht has probably made 
  
Boring’s oxygen restoration record, whereas B in our figure is marked 
Capt. Davis’ restoration record. Opportunity was not given the author to 
read this proof. He had hoped to extend his work to the effect of oxygen 
hunger upon the accuracy of machine-gun firing which could very easily 
have been investigated in the tank by means of the machine-gun camera. 
In the above report on the effect of oxygen hunger the temperature 
was not accurately controlled. It ranged from 69° F. at the beginning of 
the experiment to 72° F. at the close. The tank permitted some circulation 
of outside air.
-P-A-G-E-410
      
   PSYCHOLOGY 
the most careful study of this problem in connection with the 
schools. He tested pupils for 10 minutes at 4 periods in the day 
and with a careful enough technic to obtain reliable results. The 
amount and accuracy of the work done practically did not vary. 
Nearly all other investigators confirm this finding. 
Effect of Prolonged Fast Upon Certain Functions.—In the 
spring of 1912 Langfeld made a study of Agostino Levanzin, a 
forty-year-old individual, sound and normal in every respect. 
Before the fast to be described he had gone without food at one i 
other time for 40 days, pleading a case in court on the 26th day of 
his fast. Before this fast he weighed 180 pounds and after it 140 
pounds. On the above date he began his fast at the Nutrition 
Laboratory of the Carnegie Institute of Washington in Boston. 
His weight at the beginning of the test was 134 pounds and at the 
end 106 pounds. The fast endured from the morning of April 
14 to May 15, a period of 31 days. During that time 750 c.e. of 
distilled water was drunk daily, but no food of any kind was 
taken. The following tests were made at intervals: Rote memory 
for words, tapping, strength, tactual space threshold, touch 
threshold, free association, association reaction, cancellation, 
handwriting, visual acuity, and memory for words after 55 min- 
utes. Unfortunately this subject was not well practiced in many 
of these functions before the test began, so that the factor of im- 
provement enters in as an offset to the possible loss through 
fasting. While in one way this is disadvantageous, in another 
way it is of interest and importance in view of the fact that it 
shows that lack of food even for long periods does not stop) the 
learning process. 
It would take us too far afield to examine separately the vari- 
ous tests upon this fasting individual. In general it may be 
stated that there was a loss in muscular strength, a gain in sen- 
sory acuity and a decided increase in efficiency in those functions 
not practiced well before the test began. In other words, learn- 
ing took place much as it would have taken place had the indi- 
vidual not been fasting. Several other tests similar in character   
 
-P-A-G-E-411
  THE ORGANISM AT WORK 399 
have been carried out upon fasting individuals, but not with the 
same degree of scientific oversight. The most noticeable case is 
Luciani’s test of Succi, who fasted for 30 days. Merlatti is re- 
ported to have fasted for 50 days and Dr. Tanner for 40 days. 
All of these subjects apparently remained in good physical condi- 
tion during the fast. Luciani states that-‘Succi was at all times very 
eager to enter into discussions upon abstract subjects. The 
strength tests on Levanzin and Succi are quite similar. A dyna- 
mometer was handed to the subject, who gave it a maximum 
pressure and returned it to the experimenter. Ten trials were 
made at intervals of one second with both the right and the left 
hand. The curve showing the record made by Levanzin is inter- 
esting. Langfeld describes it as follows (the subject was prob- 
ably left-handed) : 
Both in the right (VII) and left hand (V) curves there is 
an initial falling off, which is more marked with the former hand. 
The latter, however, continues to fall to the 11th day, on which 
day it takes a decided drop, while the former declines more gradu- 
ally to the ninth day, when it reaches its maximum. Both curves 
then rise to a maximum, which is reached by the left hand on the 
16th day and by the right hand on the 12th day (the record of 
the first day not being considered in speaking of this maximum). 
The curves then fall, the left much more than the right, espe- 
cially in the middle of the series, the former reaching its mini- 
mum on the 31st day. Both curves show a slight end spurt. 
This is, as a glance at the curve will show, merely a rough pic- 
ture, there being decided rises and falls throughout. 
On the day the fast began the dynamometer tests of the left 
hand averaged about 93 pounds. On the day the fast ended, 
about 88 pounds. 
Other Factors Affecting the Curve of Work.—Efficiency 
engineers and psychologists are actively engaged in experimenta- 
tion upon many other factors which may affect the worker and 
his output. One such form of experimentation is upon the effect 
of distraction (introduction of conflicting stimuli). In every 
business office or factory there are, of course, noises of machinery,
-P-A-G-E-412
  400 PSYCHOLOGY 
typewriters, telephone conversations and the like. Morgan * has 
shown that where the stimulating value of the problem is kept 
high loss in the output from any function through distraction is 
very much less than is popularly supposed (although the subject 
exerts greater muscular effort, presses down harder upon the 
keys, etce.). It is well known that sudden noises and those in- 
frequently met with have a disturbing effect on account of their 
tendency to arouse the fear reaction. Where the disturbances 
are regular the phenomenon of adaptation enters in and the 
worker ceases to be disturbed by extraneous stimuli. One of the 
most striking illustrations of this was observed in the Army. In 
the Air Personnel office when the force was small typewriters 
had to be stopped when long-distance calls were answered. As 
the pressure of the work increased and as the office force trebled 
and quadrupled, it was no uncommon sight to see a man answering 
a long-distance telephone call with fifteen or twenty typewriters 
going in his immediate neighborhood and a hundred or more 
going in the one large room. Again, while experimentation over 
short periods of time may show that such stimuli are without 
immediate effect, it still seems safest to have offices and factories 
arranged so that the worker is as free as possible from extraneous 
disturbances. The wear and tear on the human organism is 
probably a positive thing even though temporary laboratory 
studies fail to give marked evidence of it. 
Recently a large number of experiments have been made 
upon the most satisfactory systems of lighting. Indeed, there is 
  
*Morgan worked with an apparatus in which the subject had to press 
a key similar to a typewriter key a certain number of times when a certain 
symbol appeared. The activity was thus possibly not very different from 
typewriting. As the subject continued to make his adjustments a fire-bell 
with an eight-inch gong was sounded directly behind and eight feet away. 
Bells of other types were used and various buzzers. Phonographic records 
were also played. Some of his conclusions are as follows: The initial or 
shock effect of the noise is to retard the speed of the work. After this initial 
retardation there is an increase of speed. During distraction extra pressure 
is exerted upon the keys and verbal articulation occurs, as is shown by 
changes in the breathing. By means of this additional muscular effort put 
forth the amount of work done per unit of time is not materially decreased.

now a well-organized society of illuminating engineers. There 
is general agreement that bright lights are disturbing and that 
evenness and uniformity in illumination rather than great in- 
tensity are the conditions to be striven for except in those cases 
where the task demands high intensity, as in drafting and the 
doing of fine work generally. 
A General Caution on Efficiency Methods.—It seems that a 
general caution on all efficiency experimentation is not out of 
place here. In recent years there has been a constant tendency 
to turn to the study of the man: the technic and machine sides of 
industry have been worked up to a point of maximum efficiency. 
Output if increased must come from a better understanding of 
man. Psychologists have aided and abetted industry in solving 
this problem. When the improved output comes from selecting 
the most suitable man for the task, from eliminating waste ef- 
fort, improving training methods and allowing recreation and 
proper periods of rest, such efforts are in the right direction. 
But the industries are undoubtedly abusing the situation. Every 
effort is being made, by the bonus system, appeal to loyalty, 
patriotism and pride, to grind as much out of the organism as 
possible in the shortest space of time. We would not stay the 
advance of efficiency engineering for a moment, but we would 
urge that every new device for getting increased output from the 
worker should, before being recommended and adopted, be 
studied from the standpoint of its effect upon the total activity 
of the worker—in popular terms, its effect upon his happiness 
and comfort. UU 
Tus Revative Erriciency or tHe Two SExus. 
Sex Differentiation—Probably no other subject, unless it be 
that of alcohol, has had so many partisan observations made upon 
it as that of the relative efficiency of men and women. There 
are so many variable factors which are not at present under con- 
trol that everything which may be discovered by putting the two 
sexes to a test must be looked upon as being purely provisional. 
The question as to whether there are distinctive differences dis- 
playing themselves in the infancy of the two sexes has never been

worked out with any degree of sureness. Certain school obse 
tions would tend to show that there is a difference from the 
beginning in the activities of the male and female child; in the 
things they make with their hands, in the things that they col- 
lect, and in the speed with which they acquire certain eine 
It has been stated recently that during the first few grades there 
are as many good writers among boys as among girls, but that 
after this period is passed the girls are, as a rule, very much 
better writers than the boys, the handwriting of the boys ne 
ing more or less careless and showing great individual variation. 
In regard to early differentiation of activities of both the in- 
stinetive and habit types it seems safe to say that the conditions 
from the beginning are different. We do not have common social 
education for boys and girls: almost immediately the girl i 
swept into one system and the boy into another—from infaney 
they are differentiated as to their dress, their general activity 
and the things that they are allowed to play with. Until the two 
sexes are brought up side by side and under exactly the same 
conditions, no reliable conclusions in this division of the prob- 
lem can be obtained. A good many statements are current with 
respect to later instinctive and emotional activity. It is stated 
also that men are more pugnacious than women and that this 
gives a reason for the greater vocational aggressiveness of the 
male and also that the male is more variable in tendencies than 
the female, but there are no reliable data to support these asser- 
tions. In the better class of society men are taught to protect 
women and never to ‘‘strike a woman’’ and where possible to 
avoid a quarrel with a woman. In the humbler walks of life the 
police courts show probably more quarrels and fights among 
women neighbors than among the men in the same locality. On 
account of having less physical strength women do not engage 
in actual physical combat with men very often and yet this is 
not to be generalized in any sense. It is also stated that parental 
love is stronger in women than in men. Here again we find the 
influence of the group as a whole at work upon the individual. 
Men are not less fond of their children than women are, but 
they cannot nurse them nor are they willing to be bored by   
 
-P-A-G-E-415
THE ORGANISM AT WORK 403 
looking after their hourly needs and since they are stronger 
they, in general, have their way. This is made more easily pos- 
sible by the fact that as society is constructed the man can more 
readily than the woman win the bread for the family. The 
divorce courts show that the sticking point in many separations 
is the child. There would be a great many more separations than 
at present if the children did not have to go with one or with 
the other parent. If parental love (which is largely of the asso- 
ciational and non-instinctive type) were not as strong in the man 
as in the woman there would not be this eternal legal battle for 
the child. Indeed, an argument may be advanced here for a 
really stronger attachment for the child in the male than in the 
female, since by getting the child the amount of alimony coming 
to the woman is greatly increased and her social position made 
more secure. 
In regard to physical characteristics it is generally admitted 
that women have a smaller stature and less physical strength and 
that these differences unquestionably produce some difference in ° 
the possibility of certain motor acquisitions: for example, it is all 
but impossible for a woman to learn to throw a ball or other object 
with speed and accuracy. Again a comparison of athletic records 
shows that the speed of women in the 100-yard dash is very much 
less than that of men. Whether this is due to structural differ- 
ences or to the lack of an adequate system of coaching does not 
appear. In certain other manual activities, such as playing ten- 
nis, swimming, diving, speed in running a typewriter the women 
are not so greatly at a disadvantage. Formerly a good deal was 
made of the asserted difference in brain weight between men and 
women. Mall has shown that the difference in brain weight is 
purely a difference in the relative size of the two sexes. 
In regard to laboratory tests it has been shown over and 
over again that the differences if any are very slight. Women are 
said to excel in such recondite activities as color naming, can- 
cellation tests, spelling and the acquisition of languages; the sexes 
are said to be equal in retentiveness, speed and accuracy of asso- 
ciation, mathematics, differential reactions to color; whereas men 
are supposed to excel in history (as judged by school marks), 
   
-P-A-G-E-416
404 PSYCHOLOGY 
ingenuity, accuracy of movement, physics and chemistry (school 
marks), reaction time and speed of movement. 
In so far as life’s activities are concerned the accomplishments 
of women are undoubtedly below those of men. There are few 
or no great women artists, few who have written enduring litera- 
ture and few who have obtained great success in instrumental 
music either as composers or performers. On the other hand, 
there are and have been as many great women singers as men. 
It is extremely interesting that the violin, which is an instrument 
well within the strength and endurance of women, has never 
been an instrument upon which they excel. There have been 
few great women scientists. Undoubtedly, the failure of women 
to achieve greatness in many of these vocational and artistic 
fields is due to social conditions; for example, it is only within 
recent years that the universities have encouraged women scien- 
tists and even then for them to have a fair show in scientific mat- 
ters their training in manual dexterity should start at birth, as 
it does for men. University positions would have to be open 
to women as they are to men if they are to have the same stimu- 
lus for achievement in scientific lines. 
The insistent question arises always in discussing these prob- 
lems as to whether functional periodicity is a serious handicap 
to women. The common-sense view and the view of commercial 
houses is that it is a handicap. But if certain recent experimental 
evidence can be trusted (Hollingwort! 1) there is no difference 
at such times either in speed or accuracy in the exercise of any 
given established habit or in the acquisition of habit. 
Few or none of these observations touch the really vital ques- 
tion. The fundamental fact is that attractive women do not have 
to compete in vocational life and nearly every woman has at 
least one man who passes a favorable judgment upon her. Hence, 
when business difficulties arise, when hard training periods face 
them, many women choose the seemingly easier road and allow 
some man to earn the bread for two. Having once accepted the 
sheltered position, there is again neither the incentive nor the 
opportunity to achieve in the field that men achieve in. There 
are exceptions, of course, to this general statement, but no more 
 
-P-A-G-E-417
  THE ORGANISM AT WORK 405 
than enough to prove the rule, notwithstanding the fact that 
more and more positions are open to women. The labor turn- 
over among attractive women is greater than among men and 
probably always will be. Hence, all discussion of and experi- 
mentation upon the relative ability of men and women are 
really academic. 
B. Factors AFFECTING THE ACQUISITION OF Hapits. 
Generalized Statements on Habit Acquisition—During the 
past fifteen years there has been a growing body of research on 
the acquisition of habits both in the field of human psychology 
and in that of animal behavior. Furthermore, it is an encourag- 
ing sign that the general results coming from the two fields agree 
in most particulars. Without any reference to the feasibility 
or the advisability of trying to apply these findings as yet in 
school systems, it seems worth while to present some general 
formulations on acquisition and then summarize the most char- 
acteristic of the researches which support them. The following 
general statements seem to be justified : 
1. The fact of diminishing returns from practice. Within 
certain limits the less the frequency of practice the more efficient 
is each practice period. 
2. The less the number of habits formed simultaneously the 
more rapid is the rise of any given habit. 1 is valid here also, 
apparently, regardless of the number of habits formed 
simultaneously. 
8. Again within certain limits, the younger the organism the 
more rapidly will the habit be formed. This generalization as 
yet has not been completely established. 
4. Word or other symbolic material which has to be learned 
to the point of errorless verbal reproduction, regardless of its 
Jength, should be learned by the whole rather than by the part 
method. 
5. The higher the incentive to the formation of the habit 
and the more uniformly this incentive is maintained the more 
rapidly will the habit be formed. 
1. The Fact of Diminishing Returns from Practice.—This
-P-A-G-E-418
  406 PSYCHOLOGY 
conclusion has now been firmly established for both human and 
animal acquisitions. Several types of activity have been studied 
in human learning. Pyle compared the value of practicing 5 
hours a day (distributed over the day) with practicing 1 hour 
per day (distributed over the day). Five of his subjects worked 
for 10 half-hour periods a day with half-hour rests between prac- 
tices on learning to use the typewriter. We will call this group 
the fast group. It worked for 9 successive days, omitting prac- 
tices on Sunday, putting in a total of 90 half hours of practice. 
The subjects in this group did nothing else for 9 days. Five other 
subjects worked for 2 half-hour periods a day, 1 period at 8 a.m. 
and the other period at 2 p.m. or 3 P.M. We will call this the slow 
group. This group worked for a period of 45 days, putting in a 
total of 45 hours, the same as the fast group. The subjects’ 
practice consisted in transcribing fairly homogeneous material on 
the typewriter. The work of the slow group was better from the 
start. On the tenth practice the fast group was writing an aver- 
age of 287 words per half hour, the slow group 370. On the 
fortieth practice the fast group was writing 351 words, the slow 
group 557. From the fortieth practice on the difference between 
the two groups remained nearly constant. The slow group, how- 
ever, made more errors than the fast group. 
A similar study has been made upon the acquisition of skill 
in archery (Lashley). The subjects were all forced to shoot 500 
times, regardless of the number of shots the individual made per 
day.. They were thrown into the following groups: one group 
shot 5 times per day, another 12 times per day, another 20 times 
- per day and a fourth group 40. These four groups were al! care- 
fully selected.° None of the individuals had had previous prac- 
tice in shooting with the English long bow (page 303). The final 
accuracy of the last 25 shots was chosen as a measure of the 
amount of improvement which had taken place. The learning   | 
°A fifth group composed of athletic youths from the Baltimore Poly- 
technic Institute, shooting 60 shots per day, was also formed. They differed 
so in their strength and development from the other groups that the results 
will not be considered here. The records of this group really form excep- 
tions to those of the other four groups,
-P-A-G-E-419
THE ORGANISM AT WORK 407 
curve of one of these groups is shown on page 305. The group 
shooting 5 times per day learned to shoot very much more ac- 
curately than the group using the more rapid methods. 
Certain other activities have been studied; for example, 
Dearborn showed in a class experiment in drawing that 10 min- 
utes’ practice once a day gives better results than 10 minutes’ 
practice twice a day. Starch contrasted the following four 
periods: one 120-minute period, three 40-minute periods, six 
20-minute periods and twelve 10-minute periods. He thus at- 
tempted to answer the question: what is the best distribution of 
time if you have only 120 minutes to practice? The 10-minute 
period was found best, the 20-minute nearly as good, the 40-min- 
ute next in value and the longest period of least value. 
Pyle reports other results bearing upon economy in learning. 
The subjects were forced to learn new symbols to take the place 
of the 26 letters of the alphabet and were then practiced in ac- 
quiring skill in writing with this new alphabet. The subjects 
practiced for half an hour, then rested for half an hour and re- 
peated this routine throughout the day. Practice was not con- 
tinued for a longer period than 1 day—14 half hours of work, 
14 half hours of rest. It was found that after 3 or 4 periods of 
work the remaining practices showed little improvement ; nor was 
the permanent effect from the practice any better for the persons 
that worked all day than for those who practiced only 4 periods 
and then stopped.” ; 
Although the greater economy and beneficial effects of short 
infrequent practices are universally established, one cannot argue 
from this that concentrated practice is worthless. It depends. 
upon the situation the human being is in. Undoubtedly a man 
could learn to fly better by half an hour’s work every other day 
than by 2 hours’ work every day given the same total amount of 
practice, but with the enemy at the door there is the necessity to 
train the greatest number of men in the shortest possible time. 
  
™It seems to be established that the permanence of habits acquired by 
distributed practice is slightly better than that acquired by concentrated 
practice. ’
-P-A-G-E-420
ee Ee we ene ey Om ewe Hee eee et ee se ce ae eae ee oe 
In such cases the obvious thing to do is to force practice each day 
to the point where improvement from daily practice ceases. On 
the other hand, this principle is of very great importance in view 
of the fact that we can advantageously utilize short periods of 
time, not otherwise employed, for enormously increasing our 
repertoire of acts which may later be of economic importance or 
which may serve us for recreation or relaxation. 
2. The Less the Number of Habits Formed Simultaneously 
the More Rapid is the Rise of Any Given Habit.—So far the 
only thorough piece of work grounded in experimentation which 
verifies this formulation comes from the study of animals 
(Ulrich). If we take three large groups of animals and allow 
each group to work upon a different problem, thereby establish- 
ing reliable norms for the three problems and then take another 
group and allow it to learn all three problems simultaneously, 
it will be found that this fourth group will require a larger num- 
ber of trials to learn each problem than the norm previously 
established calls for (it will be found also that fact 1 is operative). 
Some scattering experimental results would seem to bear out 
this conclusion for human learning as well, but the results as yet 
are by no means trustworthy. Even though it be firmly estab- 
lished it has little practical significance, because it runs into con- 
flict with fact 1 in the sense that if we try to instruct the youth by 
such a method and at the same time give him infrequent practice, 
he would be idle during the larger part. of his time. 
3. The Effect of Maturity Upon Learning.—No adequate 
experiments are at hand upon humans which will enable us to 
show quantitatively the differences in the speed and accuracy of 
the acquisition of any given act of skill among a young adult of 
twenty-one, a man of forty, and a man of sixty-five. In practi¢al 
life there are a number of taboos, laws and customs relating to 
age: for example, a man cannot vote until the age of twenty-one 
is reached. At forty a man is expected to have shown all the 
originality that is in him and to have accomplished his major 
piece of work; he is supposed to be content at that age with the 
habit acquisitions at his command. Again, at from sixty to 
sixty-five a man’s usefulness is siipbsell to undergo a sharp de- 408 | | | 
  
 
-P-A-G-E-421
  THE ORGANISM AT WORK 409 
cline, he is supposed at that age to retire from his university, 
business and professional duties, to accept a pension and to live 
thereafter a quiet and retired life. There is hardly any justifica- 
tion, experimental in character, for these age distinctions. The 
experiments bearing directly upon the problem again come from 
the study of animals. Although our results from animal learn- 
ing are not any too secure, we have some evidence to show that 
a difference exists between the young animal and the old. Miss 
Hubbert allowed nearly 100 rats differing in age to learn a maze 
in which the speed of the various trips, the amount of useless 
running on each trip, and the number of trials necessary to 
learn the maze could be accurately determined. The two groups 
of animals beginning work respectively at 25 and 65 days of age 
learned in about the same number of trials, whereas the 300-day- 
old animals required nearly a third more trials. This difference 
in the number of trials between the old and young animals in 
learning the maze probably needs to be confirmed. However, it 
was firmly established that the time of the final execution of the 
act was very much shorter for the young animals than for the old, 
the young animals traversing the maze in 6 seconds, whereas the 
old animals required 10 seconds. Probably the most significant 
thing from the standpoint of middle-aged and old human indi- 
viduals is that even the oldest animal we could get (500 and 600 
days) still had the ability to learn this complicated maze. Thus 
our former notions about the lack of plasticity in the old are 
without foundation if such results can be carried over into the 
human fields, as they doubtless can be. This generalization would 
seem to be of importance since experiments apparently show that 
it is possible for a man or woman who has been too busy in youth 
and in middle-age to form habits of play and recreation to learn 
to play or even to form vocationally serviceable habits after retir- 
ing from active business life. Such a possibility should make old 
age less of a bugbear and less of an affair of endless reminiscence 
and total redintegration of earlier experiences. 
4, The Whole vs. the Part Method in Learning—Where 
prose and poetry in considerable amounts have to be learned to
-P-A-G-E-422
  410 PSYCHOLOGY 
the point where verbal reproduction is possible as is the case in 
the schools, dramatic work, public speaking and the like, the ques- 
tion arises as to the most economical way of committing this 
material. The schoolboy, if let alone, learns one stanza, and 
oftentimes one line, before proceeding to the next; then after the 
second stanza is learned he goes back to the first and repeats both 
until an errorless reproduction of both is possible. He continues 
this routine for the whole poem, regardless of its length. This 
means, of course, that the early stanzas are always over-learned. 
With few exceptions the experimental results show that the whole 
method of learning is better than the part, that is, that the ma- 
terial, regardless of its length, should be read through again and 
again until reproduction as a whole becomes possible. In addi- 
tion to the possibility of more rapid acquisition accruing from 
the use of the whole method, retentiveness seems to be better 
where material is learned in that way than when learned by the 
part method (Pyle and Snyder, Lakenan, and others). 
5. The Higher the Incentive and the More Uniform the 
Incentive the More Rapid and Steady will be the Improve- 
ment.—There are no separate experimental studies on the effect 
of different incentives upon acquisition, but the incidental results 
from the study of all recorded learning illustrate this law. The 
industries recognize the law and even during the earliest appren- 
ticeship period the attempt is made to give extra monetary reward, 
promises of future position, advancement and the like to increase 
the speed of acquisition. As we have already brought out, most 
of the plateaux in the recorded learning curves are probably due 
to a failure to keep the stimulating value of the task high. Most 
interesting illustrations of the effect of high incentives were 
brought out in the recent war. The number of rivets which could 
be driven home in any given day by an individual engaged in 
shipbuilding increased by leaps and bounds as soon as the news- 
papers began to exploit it and to post the various scores over the 
country and as soon as the Government began to offer prizes for 
the highest score. Altitude records in flying and long-distance 
flying are equally illustrative of this principle. 
 
-P-A-G-E-423
THE ORGANISM AT WORK 411 
One of the greatest difficulties in the ordinary routine of daily 
life is the fact that the stimulating value of any incentive soon 
loses its power to arouse emotion. The incentive, then, has to 
be changed. A good many business houses admit that their devices 
for offering added stimulation produce only a temporary increase 
in output. The attempt is now being made with better results 
to introduce profit-sharing, partial ownership in the business and 
group insurance (which is lost if the worker leaves). These de- 
~ vices offer permanent and camulative rewards. In addition to 
their effect upon keeping the stimulating value of the work high 
they decrease the labor turnover.

  CHAPTER XI 
PERSONALITY AND ITS DISTURBANCE 
A. Tue Systematic Stupy or PERSONALITY. 
Introduction.—In previous chapters we have dealt largely 
with the genesis and functioning of individual reaction systems. — 
Psychologists and psychiatrists often have the task of rating the 
individual as a member of society, passing judgment upon him 
as a whole from the standpoint of how well or how poorly he 
functions in his present environment, to form estimates of how 
smoothly he would react to a new environment and to specify 
the necessary changes in his equipment which would make for 
present and future adjustment. Various practical situations 
force us constantly to examine man in this broader way. In mak- 
ing such estimates or inferences we use the term personality or 
character’ as a convenient way of expressing the fact that we are 
looking at the individual not from the standpoint of how well or 
how poorly any particular emotion, instinct or group of habits 
he possesses many function, but from that of how the organism 
as a whole works or many work under changed conditions. 
A Possible Hint from Mechanics.—Several times in the text 
we have contrasted the reaction of parts with reactions of the 
individual as a whole. To illustrate this more completely it may 
be well possibly to turn to the world of mechanics for at least 
a slight analogy. A marine gas coat is made up of a number 
of parts, such for example as the carburetor, the pump, the 
magneto, the valve system, the cylinders with their pistons and 
  
*As we use these two terms, character is really a subdivision of the 
broader term personality. Character is generally used when viewing the 
individual from the standpoint of his reactions to the more conventional- 
ized and standardized situations (conventions, morals, ete.). Personality 
includes not only these reactions but also the more individual and personal 
adjustments and capacities as well as their life history. Popularly 
speaking, we would say that a liar and a profligate had no character, but 
he may have an exceedingly interesting personality. 
412
-P-A-G-E-425
  PERSONALITY AND ITS DISTURBANCE 413 
rings, connecting rods, ete. Separate tests of each part may 
show that it functions perfectly when working alone. But in 
addition to the separate parts there are many interconnecting 
elements. The parts cannot work well unless the bearing sur- 
faces have just the right amount of play, the magneto must 
give the spark at the precise instant of greatest compression, the 
oiling system and pump system must be properly connected with 
some part moved by the crankshaft. Unless all of the parts 
are properly interconnected and timed the engine as a whole 
will not perform its function, that is, turn the propeller. 
‘When we speak of the action of the individual as a whole, 
we mean something of this nature. It must be borne in mind 
that the human being has not one function to perform but thou- 
sands, and the adjustments of the parts must vary in each and 
every new duty if the work of the whole organism is to be 
efficient. Only a well constructed biological organism properly 
trained can meet these requirements. No mechanical contrivance 
yet hit upon approaches the human organism in its multiplicity 
of possible functions and in the rapidity with which co-ordina- 
tions of separate functions can be so rapidly shifted for each 
new duty of the machine as a whole. 
It is interesting to push our possible analogy one step further. 
If we know enough about the parts of any mechanical contrivance, 
the nature of the interlocking systems end the various inter- 
dependent functions, we can make safe predictions about how 
it will work under new conditions or specify the changes which 
will have to be made if the contrivance must perform some new 
function. For example, in the case of our engine, we know it 
is good for high speed and short runs. Such and such changes 
will have to be made if it is to be used for medium duty or 
forced to pull heavy loads. We know further that with the 
oiling and cooling systems as they now are it will not run in a 
very cold climate; with the fuel system now employed it cannot 
be used where oxygen tension is low; that heavy fuel such as kero- 
sene or crude oil will not burn in it; that it will run in fresh water 
indefinitely but that certain parts will have to be made of bronze 
if it is to run smoothly in sea water for any length of time.
-P-A-G-E-426
  414 PSYCHOLOGY 
This hint from mechanics should pea us a clearer notion 
of (a) the reaction of the whole and of parts, (b) the possibility 
of inferring from our data on parts and our records of perform- 
ance of the apparatus as a whole how the apparatus will work 
under new conditions and the necessary changes to make in the 
parts and their interconnections in order to get it to take on 
a new function. 
Practical Use of Personality Inferences.—On a smaller 
or larger scale we are constantly having to deal with individuals 
in new situations. Knowing the part reactions of individuals 
and how they have functioned as a whole in past situations en- 
ables us to draw legitimate inferences as to how they will act 
when the new situation confronts them. Personality study in 
one form or another is thus essential in every form of social life. 
All of us face personality problems each day of our lives. We 
are put face to face with serious problems of personality when we 
are called upon to pass judgment upon our child’s selection of 
a mate, to select a life associate in business or university work, to 
begin the study and re-training of some individual whose per- 
sonality is diseased or distorted. In less serious circumstances 
we face the problem when we put two people together at a 
dinner party or make out a list of guests for a bridge party, or 
even in bringing together two of our intimate friends. Clever 
hostesses understand the social aspect of the problem very well, 
but they will tell you that their success is due not to any 
peculiar intuition on their part but to the fact that they 
study and keep posted on the intimate details of the lives of 
their friends. 
Confusion in the Concept of Personality——While everyone 
would agree that the factors we have discussed are a part of a 
personality study many would hold that this simple way of 
looking at personality is not expressive of the whole truth. They 
would maintain that it includes all these things but also ‘‘some- 
thing’’ in addition. If one asks what this something is it will be 
found that no straightforward answer can be given. Instead of 
a working definition the term will be used with qualifying adjec- 
tives : ‘‘I mean that his personality overpowers and overawes one,’’ 
)
-P-A-G-E-427
    PERSONALITY AND ITS DISTURBANCE 415 
‘that there is something magnetic about him,’’ ‘‘that he draws or 
enthralls one,’’ ‘‘commands attention or respect,’’ ‘‘his person- 
ality fills the room.’’ This usage is easily understandable. Two 
elements predominate. Without going too deeply into them we may 
briefly state first, that the above type of description is made upon 
the basis of childhood and adolescent reactions to authority. In 
infancy and adolescence the father, also the doctor, minister, ete., 
stand for authority. When they speak, obedience must be rapid 
and implicit. The child is thrown into_an emotional state and 
jumps to execute commands. This tendency to react to authority 
is never quite lost and reappears again and again in our reactions 
to individuals in our business and social circles. Hence in later 
life those speakers and associates who rearouse the vestiges of 
reaction to the old authority situation are the individuals who 
for us would be classed as having a strong personality. 
The second element underlying judgments of personality in 
this popular sense is the sexual or emotional one, sex being used 
here not in the popular sense but in the modern psychopatho- 
logical one. When this element is strongest—that is, when the 
speaker or associate (the stimulus) brings out those positive 
reaction tendencies, the popular characterization is put in a 
little different words. The man or woman has a ‘‘pleasing,’’ 
“‘thrilling’’ or ‘‘engrossing’’ personality.? Friendships are almost 
instantaneously begun largely upon the basis of this element. It 
must be recalled that according to modern usage this kind of 
reaction tendency is aroused not only by members of the opposite 
sex but also by members of the same sex. The author in making 
a statistical analysis of the factors entering into the formation 
of friendship found that the element of truthfulness was ranked 
first and loyalty second. These are of course conventionally the 
correct answers and the ranking obtained was the one expected 
in a mixed crowd. When the questionary asked for other impor- 
  
?7To illustrate, take the following quotation from Arnold Bennett: 
“T felt that once out of the immediate circle of his tremendous physical 
influence, I might manage to escape the ordeal which he had suggested. 
But I could not get away. The silken nets of his personality had been 
east, and I was enmeshed.”
-P-A-G-E-428
  416 PSYCHOLOGY 
tant elements, such items as sympathy, congeniality and the like 
took a prominent place. In general the following question was 
answered in the affirmative: ‘‘Do you decide as soon as you 
meet a person whether the basis for friendship is present?’’? The 
greatest difficulty was experienced by those attempting to make 
the analysis. They had not hitherto made the effort to phrase 
that factor in their lives in words. We meet the same difficulty 
in trying to get an answer as to why men love their wives or 
women their husbands, or parents love their children. The 
reasons advanced are conventional ones. The deeper reasons lie 
below the organized word level; upon unanalyzed (unphrased) 
emotional instinctive and early habit slants. This is the reason 
it is so difficult to get people to talk intelligently of what they 
mean by personality. 
The muddled writings we have from the hands of many 
scientific writers upon self, personality and character give only 
a slightly better working basis. Nearly every psychologist and 
medical writer has in the background of his early training certain 
religious and metaphysical premises. He finds no way to weave 
these into the straightforward scientific discussion of instinct, 
emotion and habit. Hence he brings them to the fore in a final 
discussion of the self and personality where problems are not 
usually accurately worked out and faced. Again, in the writings 
of scientists we also see the early reactions to authority. It 
shows as an unwillingness to admit that the individual has 
within himself all of the determining factors for action. It is 
found necessary to bring in to account for self and personality, 
if not overtly at least covertly, a nucleus, a core, or essence which 
resists analysis, which cannot be expressed in the plain facts of 
hereditary and acquired reactions and their integrations. This 
is illustrated all through the history of philosophy in the ‘‘spirit’’ 
of Berkley, in the ‘‘consciousness’’ and ‘‘self’’ of modern psycho- 
logical writers and in the ‘‘unconscious’’ of the Freudian mystics. 
Behavioristic and Common-Sense Conception of Per- 
sonality— Again we seem to have reached a point in psychology 
where we can make progress most rapidly by discarding these 
vague conceptions of personality and starting with premises
-P-A-G-E-429
   PERSONALITY AND ITS DISTURBANCE 417 
which will yield useful and practical results capable of being 
couched in the ordinary language of science. Let us mean 
by the term personality an individual’s total assets (actual 
and potential) and liabilities (actual and potential) on the reac- 
tion side. By assets we mean first the total mass of organized 
habits; the socialized and regulated instincts; the socialized and 
tempered emotions; and the combinations and interrelations 
among these; and secondly, high coefficients both of plasticity 
(capability of new habit formation or altering of old) and of 
retention (readiness of implanted habits to function after 
disuse). Looked at in another way, assets are that part of the 
individual’s equipment which make for his adjustment and 
balance in his present environment and for readjustment if the 
environment changes. 
By liabilities we mean similarly that part of the individual’s 
equipment which does not work in the present environment and 
the potential or possible factors which would prevent his rising 
to meet a changed environment. In more detail, we mean that 
we can enumerate the reasons for his present lack of adjustment 
in such terms as insufficiency’ of habits, lack of social instincts 
(instinet not modified by habit), violence of emotion or insuf- 
ficiency or lack of emotion, and that we can infer that with his 
present equipment and plasticity the individual cannot make a 
satisfactory adjustment either to his present environment or 
possibly to any other environment. In ease his potential assets 
are sufficient we can enumerate and begin the inculcation of those 
factors which will make for his adjustment. 
This way of looking at personality seems to call for a standard 
of adjustment and seems to imply that such a standard is avail- 
able. Our standard at present is a common-sense and practical 
one. Practically we do in our daily routine of life take individ- 
uals with whom we are acquainted and point out the essential 
factors which make them occupy the place they do in social and 
community life. The better trained we are the more accurately 
we can point these factors out. The question as to whether we 
shall ever have scientific and accurate standards need not con- 
caus at the present moment.

  418 PSYCHOLOGY ; 
The Systematic Study of Personality.—At first sight we 
might be tempted to assume that in order to study personality 
one should have a microscopic view of an individual’s whole life 
both past and present. Unquestionably the more complete our 
knowledge is of the present and past of any person the more 
accurate our analysis of his personality will be. But at best 
for both practical and scientific purposes we can obtain only a 
limited amount of data upon each individual. How then shall 
we proceed in studying personality? It is obvious that we must 
resort to ‘‘sampling.’? What samples should be taken depends 
largely upon the purposes for which the study is to be made. 
The men working in psychiatry were first to recognize the need 
of a systematic sampling of activity. Through practical expe- 
rience they have found that if they can gain even limited data 
upon certain aspects of the individual’s past and present life 
they are in a position to understand his weakness. While there 
is no absolute agreement among the different workers as to just 
what data should be gathered the general agreement is fairly 
close. There are a number of such ‘‘guides’’ to the systematic 
study of personality (Hoch and Amsden, Adolf Meyer, F. L. 
Wells, Yerkes, and others). These studies have not been worked 
out wholly in objective or behavioristic terms, but the results 
they have yielded are easily interpretable in any objective system. 
Any modern method should have as its starting point the 
discarding of all presuppositions and the putting of the individual 
in front of us for study. In general we study him as we would 
any other practical or scientific problem. We continue this 
study until we can answer definite questions about the individual. 
If we cannot immediately return the answer to an essential 
question we study him until we can. 
The following topics and questions are offered merely as in- 
dicatory of some of the more concrete and studiable factors which 
we should have information about whenever there is practical or 
scientific need for a personality judgment. The definite ques- 
tions asked are designed to bring out mainly those factors which 
eommon experience in dealing with human individuals from 
various standpoints has taught us are essential. We are merely
-P-A-G-E-431
  PERSONALITY AND ITS DISTURBANCE 419 
putting in the form of definite questions the basis upon which 
so-called intuitive and common-sense judgments about personality 
are made. 
Sueerstions TowarpD THE Stupy or PERSONALITY 
General Level of Behavior.—(1) If the individual is too 
complex to be rated by any of the ‘‘intelligence tests’’ of the 
Binet type, what do various special tests show as regards his 
range of information, vocabulary, English and literary equip- 
ment, mathematical ability, special vocational equipment? (2) 
What do actual tests show concerning his learning ability in the 
field, both of manual activity and language activity? (3) What 
do actual tests show concerning his retentiveness in these fields? 
(4) How accurately does he make observations under simple 
experimental conditions ? 
General Survey of Instinctive and Emotional Equipment 
and Attitude.—Do the number and variety of drives to activity 
seem plentiful or deficient? Are there special lines of activity 
in which he takes training easily and in which retention is 
good? Does he display a normal amount of investigatory 
behavior (curiosity) with respect to new situations, systems of 
thought, literature? Has he any knack of doing things with his 
hands (manipulation)? Does he use or substitute this knack 
of doing things for card playing, dancing, golf and other recrea- 
tion outlets? What particular bents and hobbies has he exhibited 
from time to time? What is the history of his early (pre-adoles- 
cent) sex enlightenment, sex attachments, and curiosities (see 
also under organized sex life, p. 401) ? Are there any instinctive 
traits especially with regard to eliminative and sex functions yet 
unsocialized, such for example as general bodily display, display 
of parts, lack of sex fixation, etc? 
Are his emotional reactions well balanced or is he over- or 
under-emotional; liable to be easily upset, becoming angry or 
violent or unduly retiring when certain topics are under discus- 
sion or when in the presence of certain situations? If so, what 
situations most easily arouse emotional activity both of the 
primitive type, such as fears, rages, love, etc., and the more
-P-A-G-E-432
420 PSYCHOLOGY 
systematized and adult type which takes the form of attitudes? 
Have there been strong attachments or antagonisms for any 
member of the family? Have these been outgrown or have they 
been carried over into adult life? Would he be classed now, or 
was he so classed as a boy, as a sissy ; was he as a lad ever taunted 
with being tied to his mother’s apron string? How many infantile 
emotional reactions and attitudes have been carried over into adult 
life, such as biting the nails, playing with the mouth and face, 
spitting? What outlets does his more organized emotional life 
take, e.g., day dreaming, making or writing of fanciful produc- 
tions? (Consult here chapter on emotions, p. 236, and also the sec- 
tion in the present chapter on personal slants and peculiarities.) 
General Habits of Work.—Does he complete work under- 
taken promptly and neatly or is he a procrastinator, a maker of 
excuses and in general a temperamental worker? Is he punctual 
at his tasks and appointments? When stuck on a given task does 
he give up easily with signs of emotional disturbance or does he 
as a rule work persistently until the difficulties are overcome? 
Does he work to his limit or is there a constant tendency to save 
himself? In leaving his work is he one of the first to drop his 
task or will he work later than regulations specify? Is he 
adverse to having extra duties put upon him? Must his duties 
be laid out for him by rule of thumb or need one give him only 
general outlines? Would you classify him as being resourceful 
or merely as a doer of chores and routine? Did he as boy or man 
ever build, design or plan any new object or write an original 
production? What has been the history of his vocational 
endeavors and achievements and what have his earnings been 
(or its equivalent in rank) at different ages? Is he fixed upon 
his present level of attainment or is he making steady or rapid. 
progress? If not making progress, is his work suited to his 
attainments? Would he work better in another line, or would he 
rise from his present level of attainment if his responsibilities 
were greater and if he had more difficulties to contend with? 
Activity Level—Would you characterize the subject as being 
lazy, industrious, or active in manual work? Is he talkative or 
taciturn, slow or active in speech? Is he a story teller or
-P-A-G-E-433
  PERSONALITY AND ITS DISTURBANCE 421 
extemporaneous speaker? Are his acts or speech ever violent or 
rude? Is he given to sudden bursts of loud conversation and 
frequent laughter? Are his work and talk systematic and logical 
in character? Are his movements made in good form or is he 
awkward in gait, work and speech? Would you characterize 
him as being a man always in a hurry, restless, eager? Is he 
constantly talking of the many things he has to do or that he has 
left undone? Can he put his work aside or must he take it with 
him, conversationally at least, into his social life and moments 
of recreation? 
Social Adaptability—Does he get along well with his wife, 
parents or members of his immediate family, with his business 
associates, with his companions in recreation? What is his 
history with respect to association with others? How many 
intimate friends has he among his own and the opposite sex? Of 
how long standing (carried from infaney or formed in later 
life)? How easily does he get acquainted with people when in a 
new environment? How rapidly does he become settled in a new 
environment? How would you rate him with respect to tact- 
fulness, quarrelsomeness, co-operation, etc.? Apart from any 
money or social status that he may possess, is his society sought 
by others? Is he in general loyal to his friends and does he make 
active efforts to hold them? Has he had any history of leading 
men? What position of prominence in games, sports or social 
life has he held? 
Recreation and Sports.—What are the main types of his play 
activities and how successful has he been in them? Is he of the 
one sport type (7.e., possessing a single hobby, such as golf, poker) 
or is he an all round sportsman? Does he sacrifice his work and 
responsibility to exercise his recreation and sporting tendencies? 
Are there special forms of play, especially of chance such as 
cards and roulette, which amount to obsessions and toward which 
he displays a lack of balance? 
Organized Sex Life.—Will he talk freely of his sex life when. 
questioned about it for scientific purposes or does he avoid 
reference to this phase of his life or to certain periods of it? 
Has he a tendency to talk too freely about his sex experiences 
 
-P-A-G-E-434
  422 PSYCHOLOGY i 
and to be\boastful/of his conquests? Obtain from him as careful 
a statement as possible of the chief events in his sex life and the 
effect they have had upon his life history. Include here the 
adolescent struggle, the transition to heterosexual fixation, his 
infatuations and the like. Does he attribute his success or lack 
of success to any of these factors? 
If married, what has been the history of the relationship? Is 
he affectionate and kind or jealous, irritable and fault-finding? 
Is he domineering or submissive? Does prudishness, frigidity 
or avoidance mark the relationship? Has there been any tend- 
ency towards perversion in any form, cruelty, ete.? Does he 
show any peculiarities with respect to certain foods and odors? 
Have children been sought? Has any home life been established ? 
Do husband and wife have the same friends and play the same 
games or are they held together merely by social pressure or the 
joint responsibility of children? 
Reactions to Conventional Standards.—As judged by ordi- 
nary standards (and with special reference to the group in which 
he lives) is he truthful, faithful to his word, and careful of 
the rights and reputation of others? Is he frank in his 
opinions and statements, trustworthy in money matters or the 
reverse? Put specifically to him such questions as whether 
under any circumstances it is ever justifiable to tell a lie, 
to steal, to cheat, to fall in love with an engaged or married 
woman and tell her about it? To kill another individual or 
to commit suicide? 
Personal Bias and Peculiarities—Has his early home, school 
or religious training implanted fixed modes of reacting which 
are not in line with his present environment—that is, is he easily 
shocked, for example, at seeing a woman smoke, drink a cocktail 
or flirt with a man; at card playing; at the fact that many of his 
associates do not go to church? Have past failures in early home 
life, married or business life developed a ‘‘soured’’ disposition or 
attitude? Has he become a woman hater, a rebel against social 
law and order, and in general a misogamist or does his general 
restlessness at failure take another form in which he actually 
attaches himself to each new movement in thought or in philos-
-P-A-G-E-435
  PERSONALITY AND ITS DISTURBANCE 423 
ophy, religion, art, music, politics? Has the early petting or 
cruelty he has received at the hands of interested individuals 
made him boastful, timid, proud, overbearing; or is he generally 
balanced in these respects? Examine him especially with refer- 
ence to his brooding and sensitiveness. What are his chief lines 
of sensitiveness and how does this sensitiveness show itself? In 
shutting himself “off and putting up a barrier against social 
contact or in complaints that every hand is against him? How 
in general have his disappointments and successes left him so 
far as new undertakings are concerned? 
Are there peculiarities in voice, gesture, gait, physical appear- 
ance, defects or weaknesses in organs which arouse emotion when 
he is forced to face them? Have these been adjusted to and 
compensated for to such an extent that he will talk with you freely 
about them, or have they developed within him a permanent 
inferiority attitude with many peculiarities in behavior developed 
to compensate for such weaknesses? Is he over-meticulous with 
reference to dirt, money matters and peccadilloes generally? 
Would you classify the individual as being foppish and over- 
dressed; does he resort to beauty treatments, perfumery, ete.? 
Is he lavish in his expenditures, exhibiting a tendency to show 
off ; or is he miserly and close? 
Balancing Factors.—How in general has he reacted to diffi- 
culties which could not be overcome? Does renunciation merely 
leave him unadjusted or does he attain readjustment by turning to 
other activities without loss of time and without serious emotional 
breakdown? What has been the history of some specific read- 
justment, after loss, for example, of position, parent, friend, 
sweetheart, wife or child? In general has he found satisfactory 
substitutes and balances for things given up and lost and for 
weaknesses of training and poor special equipment? For 
example, if he never learned to play, what does he substitute 
for this? If he has never married, what factors compensate? 
If married but with no children, what compensation has been made 
(pets, adoption of other children, ete.) ? How do his unbalanced 
tendencies show: in recklessness, excesses, speed manias, the 
seeking of exciting situations, excessive eating, dress, ete.? Can 
 
-P-A-G-E-436
424 PSYCHOLOGY 
he resort to games, music, theatre, dancing, and to club life when 
in trouble or when family relationships bid fair to remain unsatis- 
factory? Has he engrossing work which serves him as a balance 
wheel and for compensation when other things go wrong? What 
verbal account can he give of the things he has substituted for 
the things he cannot obtain—for example, one man constantly 
makes a poor score in golf, but he prides himself on having 
better ‘‘form’’ than any other member belonging to the club. 
Money suddenly acquired is often a balancing or compensating 
factor for lack of breeding and social position. A woman lack- 
ing beauty of face preens herself over her form, or lacking both, 
upon her hair, or even upon the size of her feet or the shape of her 
hand. Lack of special recognition and position of a given family 
is compensated for by the fact that they are relatives of some 
person of recognized ability and attainment. 
Have religion and church work been for him a balancing 
factor—one upon which he loads responsibility and from which 
he receives authority and by means of which he obtains surcease 
from emotional strain in times of trouble? Would you classify 
him in general as one who put his responsibilities and troubles 
upon the Lord or upon himself? * 
Personality Study Ultimately Belongs to the Laboratory.— 
In using such outlines as the above in the study of personality 
we may narrow the questions, make them more specific and then 
mark the excess of the factor in relations to the average by a + 
sign and its absence or deficiency by a — sign (Wells). We may 
obtain our data by living near the individual and observing him 
systematically under the routine of work and play; by syste- 
matically questioning him and examining into his dreams; or 
we may take him into the laboratory and complete our analysis 
by experimental methods. Unfortunately the iaboratory is not 
  
*It will be seen that this whole questionary relates principally to the 
diagnosis and evaluation as we see it in everyday life. It is not planned 
to be searching enough to throw much ‘ight upon the etiology or causation 
of personality disturbance. This phase of personality, while distinctly 
psychological in character, at present belongs more particularly to the 
domain of psychiatry.
-P-A-G-E-437
PERSONALITY AND ITS DISTURBANCE 425 
yet prepared to enter as extensively into such work as is desirable, 
but very rapid progress is being made. During the next few 
years the laboratory should make such further progress that it 
will be capable of making by actual tests serviceable and compre- 
hensive surveys of personality. 
Summary.—When we have faced our individual and have 
studied his behavior during his ordinary routine of activity by 
systematic questioning and by experiments where possible, and 
have received satisfactory answers to such questions as the above, 
we shall know his personality. We may make the study as 
complete or as sketchy as the occasion demands. For a guest 
at a house party all we may care to make sure of is that the 
person is worth while, decent, attractive, agreeable to others, 
that he can play and that his personal peculiarities will not 
unduly protrude. In trying to restore to normal a psychopathic 
personality the study would have to be made far more complete 
than we have outlined above. 
While we have not emphasized the matter in the above sketch, 
no examination of a personality would be complete without 
collateral information coming from a careful study of the individ- 
ual’s heredity, personal illnesses, use of drugs, ete. Meyer, in 
order to formulate these factors and to keep them in their 
relation to more detailed personality data, has prepared a life 
chart upon which the more significant personal data may be put 
down for each individual. It is undoubtedly advisable for each 
psychological student to make some such life chart of himself 
and even a more detailed personality study than we have out- 
lined above. Self and personality under careful scrutiny cease 
to be mysteries and become problems which can be solved by 
careful observation. 
Rapid Methods of Studying Personality.—That the study 
of personality must be a genuine research carried out in a syste- 
matic manner upon each individual has only recently been 
recognized, Almost from the earliest history of the race certain 
rapid methods of arriving at personality judgment have been in 
use. While these methods with the exception of (1) below are 
in general all but worthless, the public believes in them and 
 
-P-A-G-E-438
    426 PSYCHOLOGY 
lays itself open to become the victim both of unscrupulous 
sharpers and misguided enthusiasts. Such judgments are based 
upon four different sets of asserted data. (1) Voice, gesture, 
gait, attitude and dress group. (2) Differences in head and 
skull formation. (3) Differences in biological characteristics, 
such as eye color, color and type of hair and the shape of the 
fingers. (4) Differences in handwriting. So-called character ex- 
perts are supposed to study such differences and to pass judgment 
upon men and women who are to be employed by business houses. 
Since time immemorial such prophets have been among us. Bank- 
ing upon the fact that fifty per cent. of their judgments must 
by chance be right and that being shrewd observers they can add 
another fifteen per cent. of correct choices (which any individual 
who has wide contact with other people can do), they set up as 
“‘characterologists’’ and begin to fleece the public. We shall 
examine some of the asserted principles involved in these rapid 
determinations of character. 
(1) Personality judgments based upon voice, gesture, gait, 
ete. A momentary glimpse: of an individual reveals very little 
about his personality. Certain signs, however, have become 
classic as indicators of character, such as the square chin, the 
firm mouth, the intellectual brow, erect carriage and the like. 
It is often asserted that the kind of life the individual has led 
becomes stamped upon his face and body; that the inferior 
person shows inferiority in his attitude; that the discontented, 
complaining, hard-done-by individual has certain lines in his 
face such as the drooping lip by means of which he can be 
known. Kempf has recently given more prominence to the view 
that bodily attitudes reveal the ‘‘autonomie strivings’’ of the 
individual than most authors are willing to concede. In extreme 
eases even the static view or the photograph of an individuai 
is sufficient to reveal many factors about personality, such for 
example that he is a eretin, an idiot or a certain type of 
schizophrenic (as revealed by the Madonna attitude, ete). But 
no genuine student of human nature depends much upon what 
ean be gathered from a mere static view of the subject or an 
examination of his photograph. Any psychologist at the present
-P-A-G-E-439
  PERSONALITY AND ITS DISTURBANCE 427 
time who claims that he can pick out defective individuals 
from normals by means of photographs or by mere immediate 
visual inspection would lose the respect of his colleagues: and 
yet at the present moment there are many ‘‘experts’’ claiming 
not only to be able to do this, which is the first step in a 
character study, but also to be able to judge from the photograph 
or static view whether the individual is fitted for a certain type 
of vocation. Indeed, they have capital behind them and their 
advertisements are taken in reputable magazines. 
When we pass from the static view to even a cursory observa- 
tion of behavior we are upon a different basis entirely. One — 
can dine once with an individual and place him in a conventional 
social scale. Often the speaking of two or three sentences or 
even of a few words enables us to gather volumes about his 
general social and educational attainments. A ten minutes 
conversation skilfully conducted will bring out considerable 
data about a person’s range of training and information and 
show a great deal about his general balance. The militant anti- 
smoker, anti-drinker, suffragette, the woman or man hater, the 
religious enthusiast would not let ten minutes go by without 
revealing the causes in life which they champion. The crank 
that comes in with his new philosophical theory, the new prophet, 
the faith healer, and the promoter of forlorn undertakings lose 
no time in announcing themselves. Again, the silent observation 
of an individual in action reveals to the well trained observer 
much concerning his personality, both with reference to his 
skill and to his emotional balance. We have already developed 
this aspect to some extent in the chapter on emotions. The signs 
of, at least, temporary distress, torture, despondency and elation 
do not long remain hidden. Whether the state is permanent 
or characteristic is not so easily noticed, but, as we have brought 
out, the more permanent emotional disturbances are not without 
distinguishing marks such as the habitual biting of nails, twitch- 
ing of facial muscles and other tics, stammering, and the inability 
to sit still. 
Since rarely do we have the time or the means for systemat- 
ically examining into the personality of individuals in practical
-P-A-G-E-440
  428 PSYCHOLOGY 
life, it is obvious that most of our immediate inferences are 
based upon just such factors as gait, dress, manners, the way 
the person shakes hands, the changes in his facial expression, 
bodily attitudes and the like, plus the specific information we 
gather through chance conversation about his business, sports, 
taste and general likes and dislikes. There is no particular 
scientific technique which can be employed in making such 
inferences and we often have to modify our conclusions. There 
is no question but that our reactions and attitude towards a new- 
eomer are determined by these somewhat superficial signs. Later 
modifications of our judgments are often made difficult by reason 
of these earlier snapshot immediate estimates. 
(2) Skull and head markings (phrenology). The history of 
phrenology is too well known to need discussion. Its adherents 
assert that the external markings of the skull, the over- and under- 
development of certain parts are to be correlated with over- and 
under-development of the brain. Phrenology is based upon two 
misconceptions: first, that the brain conforms to the various 
bumps upon the surface of the skull, and, second, that the so-called 
faculties, such as amativeness, self-assertion, ambition, ete., are 
to be correlated with any particular part of the brain. Anato- 
mists have constantly brought out the fact that prominences 
upon the skull may and often are indications not of corresponding 
development in the underlying brain tissue but often of under- 
lying deficiencies. The brain in general is smooth in its contours, 
as we learned in our study of the nervous system. The neuro- 
physiologist, as has been pointed out, lays little stress upon 
localizations of brain function in any detailed sense. Phrenology 
has thus not one scientific prop to support it. Nevertheless it 
has had a most interesting and at times flourishing history. 
The only thing which can be said to the credit of phrenology is 
that interest in the general subject led to a scientifie study of 
the brain—which in time completely overthrew the doctrine 
upon which the ‘‘theory’’ was based. It still plays a réle in the 
formule of the expert characterologist. 
(3) Differences in biological characteristics. The most glaring 
and at the same time the most successful from a financial 
standpoint of the recently developed non-scientific systems of
-P-A-G-E-441
PERSONALITY AND ITS DISTURBANCE 429 
character reading is that which purports to read character by 
means of hair color, skin coloring and texture, shape and set 
of the eyes, size and shape of the nose, mouth, hands and 
fingers. To expose the falsity of the extravagant claims of the 
charlatans who advocate this it needs only to be pointed out that 
we have several well recognized biological and anthropological 
laboratories whose research men have patiently recorded both 
individual traits and biological markings. If there was a 
correlation between character and such markings it would hardly 
have escaped their observation. Such correlations may exist, 
but the scientist who discovers them and actually grounds them 
will have an enviable place in science for all time. 
(4) Handwriting and personality. Since 1662, when Camillo 
Baldo in Italy published his treatise on the method of deter- 
mining the character of a person by his handwriting, there has 
been an increasingly popular belief in the subject. Binet, 
Preyer and other investigators have made several observations 
upon correlations between sex and handwriting and between 
handwriting and general personality. To test whether sex was 
determinable from handwriting he took 180 envelopes that for 
the most part had passed through the mail, but from which all 
seals, headings and the like had been removed, and submitted 
them to two professional graphologists and to 15 persons ignorant 
of the art of graphology. Of the envelopes 89 had been addressed 
either to Binet himse!* or to members of his family by women, 
91 had been addres by men. There was of course an error 
here due to the fe hat the person could guess at the sex of 
the writer on acco of its being addressed to a female member 
of the family. T yercentage of right judgments in Binet’s 
test made by the un, _ ert averaged about 70. One of the experts, 
M. Crépieux-Jamin, had a percentage correct of 78.8. Binet 
concludes that it is possible with a certain percentage of errors 
to determine sex from handwriting. Miss Downey improved 
upon this method by having all the envelopes addressed to a 
woman. Two hundred were employed, all but 4 passed through 
the mail, 100 had been addressed by women, 100 by men. These 
200 envelopes were submitted to 13 persons each of whom 
recorded his judgment as to the sex of the writer. The ages

      430 
  of the judges varied from 15 years to 50. In every case in the 
present test, as in the French test likewise, the percentage right 
was over 60. Miss Downey concludes: ‘‘From my analysis of 
my own results I conclude that it is possible to determine sex 
from handwriting in perhaps 80 cases out of 100.’’ The basis 
upon which these judgments were made is hard to determine. 
In general the observers could not phrase the difference. Origi- 
nality is held to characterize the man’s hand, conventionality the 
woman’s; men’s writing is said to show a greater range of 
variability than women’s. This leads at times to error. The 
features are not well analyzed in any of the writings. 
Numerous tests, generally popular in nature, have been made 
upon the determination of character from certain graphological 
signs. Binet obtained samples of handwriting from 37 individ- 
uals of recognized intellectual eminence such as Renan and 
Bergson. With each of these he paired the writing of a person 
of similar education and general social level but of very mediocre 
attainments. The graphologists were asked to state which of 
each pair of writers was the more intelligent. Crépieux-Jamin 
came off best with the astonishing score of only 3 errors out 
of 36 determinations, or nearly 92 per cent. Six other graph- 
ologists’ scores were 86, 83, 80, 68, 66, 61, all distinctly superior 
to chance. 
Binet also secured specimens of the handwriting of 11 no- 
torious assassins. With each of these he paired the handwriting 
of an honest citizen in a rather humble walk of life. The expert 
graphologists were directed to tell which of each pair of writers 
was superior in general morality. Once more Crépieux-Jamin 
came off best, with 8 errors out of 11, or 73 per cent. right. 
The graphologists assert that they read character by such 
graphological signs as follows: 
   Ambition . . lines of writing slope upward 
Peridetes sts . lines of writing slope upward 
Bashfulness writing is traced with fine lines

PERSONALITY AND ITS DISTURBANCE 431 
Hull and Montgomery have recently made a detailed test of 
some of these asserted correlations. The subjects were 17 stu- 
dents of the University of Wisconsin belonging to the same 
medical fraternity. Each man was first asked to write in his 
ordinary manner a paragraph from a popular magazine. The 
writing was done in each subject’s own room at his regular 
desk with his own pen on uniform unruled paper of good quality. 
When the writing was finished the subject was given a set of 16 
small cards each containing the name of one of the other subjects, 
his own name not being included. He was directed to arrange 
the cards in the order of the amount of ambition possessed by 
the persons indicated on each. A ranking was thus obtained. 
The writing was then subjected to measurement, the m’s, n’s 
and t’s were especially measured and the ranking for ambition 
correlated with the pronounced upward slope of the lines of 
writing or the reverse. A statistical measure showed no tendency 
whatever for the ambitious person to write in an upward sloping 
direction. The subjects were also ranked for pride, and again 
the handwriting of each was examined with respect to the sloping 
character of the lines. There was no evidence of the alleged 
relation. Bashfulness was ranked and the writing examined 
for the fineness of the lines at the bend of the upward stroke 
on the 10 t’s in the paragraph. The measurement was made 
with a microscope with a micrometer in the eye-piece. Statistical 
data showed that there was no tendency for bashful people to 
write with fine lines. In a similar way force was ranked and 
the handwriting of each subject was measured. There was no 
evidence that forceful people cross their t’s heavier than anyone 
else. No correlation could be found with respect to perseverance 
and the length of the bars on the t’s,; There was no correlation 
between the closing of the a’s and o’s and reserve. 
The tests upon these students thus gave only negative results. 
When one examines the whole mass of literature bearing upon 
personality studies of these kinds one is soon convinced that it 
is a tissue of exaggeration and that the so-called results will not 
bear critical experimental testing.

B. Hasrr DisturBaNnce AnD Its Errect Upon PERSONALITY 
Introduction——Within recent years the notion has gained 
ground that\many of the ills that personality is heir to are due 
rather to failure and inadequacy on the behavior side than to any 
defect in the organic mechanism. As we pointed out on page 413, 
the separate organs of the body, heart, lungs and stomach, may 
all function properly yet the adjustments of the human machine 
as a whole may be poor and inadequate. The separate anatomical 
and functional elements are present but integration is bad. We 
see all the gradations in this lack of integration running from 
the normal individual who in association tests hesitates upon 
certain words to the hysterical individual in the clinie who has 
lost the use of arms, legs or sight.* 
Without attempting to do more than take a cursory glance 
at the field of personality disturbance and its causes, which 
belongs largely to psychiatry, let us consider for a moment some 
examples taken from laboratory studies where the habit mechan- 
isms are experimentally thrown out of gear and then examine 
into some of the generalizations which have been made concern- 
ing the effects which habit disturbance in daily life has upon 
personality. Our reason for touching upon the problem of 
personality disturbance is that no human being, as can be gath- 
ered from the preceding part of this chapter, has a perfectly 
balanced personality. All of us are practical products of our 
training and heredity. Hence some insight into the factors 
underlying personality disturbance seems a necessary part of 
even the most elementary training. 
Temporary Disturbance of Habit Experimentally Pro- 
duced.—Several years ago Stratton made a most interesting 
series of experiments to test the effect of throwing the visual 
motor reactions out of gear which was done by wearing lenses, 
prisms and mirrors in front of the eyes. For example, in one 
experiment a mirror was worn horizontally over the head and 
*We assume in this discussion of habit disturbance that the organic 
machine is working properly in the sense that there are no loss of parts, 
lesions or intoxicants as shown by actual chemica] and clinical test.  
-P-A-G-E-445
PERSONALITY AND ITS DISTURBANCE 433 
a small mirror was placed in front of the eye so as to receive 
the reflected image from the horizontal mirror. The image of 
the body thus became horizontal instead of vertical. Since two 
mirrors were used there was no reversal of right and left as 
when one looks into a glass. ‘‘The observer was thus made to 
watch himself from a point of view apparently above his own 
head. The field of view included the entire body and a limited 
region around. ee 
The experiment continued for three days. When the mirrors 
were not worn the eyes were blindfolded. The contrivance, 
of course, threw all of the regular habits out of gear. There 
was dizziness, loss of balance and marked fumbling of 
the feet and hands and lack of accurate co-ordination. Ob- 
jects that were well within range were reached for as 
though they were at a much greater distance. The process 
of visual readjustment began almost at once and progressed 
rapidly. By the end of the third day, although there was 
occasional fumbling, movements occurred with freedom and 
precision. In other words, a new habit system had taken the 
place of the old. The experiment was not continued until the 
subject became as adept in this new system of visual habits as 
in the old. 
The same phenomenon appeared when lenses were worn in 
such a way that all visual objects in the field were inverted. Walk- 
ing and movements of the hands with open eyes were extremely 
awkward and full of surprises. Naturally, when the subject 
reacted to objects with eyes closed the old habits reasserted them- 
selves and the reactions were made correctly. ‘‘The limb usually 
started in the opposite direction from the one really desired. 
When I saw an object near one of my hands and wished to grasp it 
with that hand the other hand was the one I moved. The 
mistake was then seen and by trial, observation and correction 
the desired movement was at last brought about.’’ Again as in 
the first test new habit systems were established and reactions 
to the visual objects in the environment became normal. One 
interesting thing about these experiments is the fact that the 
Seo the lenses or glasses were removed the subject slipped
-P-A-G-E-446
  434 PSYCHOLOGY 
back into his old reaction systems with almost no disturbance. The 
disturbing factor had not been present long enough to make 
the subject react differently from other people after the disturb- 
ing environment had been changed. In a later experiment the 
tests were continued for a longer time. In this third experiment 
the right-left relationship of visual objects was again reversed. 
Stratton discusses his own behavior as follows: 
Almost all eta performed under the direct guidance of 
sight were laborious and embarrassed. Inappropriate move- 
ments were sri igang made; for instance, in order to move my 
hand from a place in the visual field to some other place which 
Thad selected, the muscular contractions which would have accom- 
plished this if the normal visual arrangement had existed, now 
earried my hand to an entirely different place. The movement 
was then checked off, started off in another direction, and finally, 
by a series of approximations and corrections, brought to the 
chosen point. At table the simplest act of serving myself had 
to be cautiously worked out. The wrong hand was constantly 
used to seize anything which lay to one side. 
By the fifth day at breakfast with the lenses on the inappro- 
priate hand was rarely used to pick up an object lying to one 
side. The movement itself was easier and less wayward and 
seldom was it made in an entirely wrong direction. In walking 
he did not so often run into objects. By the seventh day 
practically all visual reactions were perfect although some econ- 
flict at times appeared. On removing the glasses on the eighth 
day there was some disturbance, continuing for that day and 
into the next morning. ‘‘In walking towards some obstacle on 
the floor of the room—a chair, for instance—I turned the wrong 
way in trying to avoid it; so that I frequently either ran into 
things in the very effort to go around them or else hesitated for 
a-moment, bewildered what I should do. I found myself more 
than once at a loss which hand I ought to use to grasp the door 
handle at my side. Of two doors side by side leading to different 
rooms I was on the point of opening the wrong one. On 
approaching the stairs I stepped up when nearly a foot too far 
away, and in writing my notes at this time I continually made 
a wrong movement of my head in attempting to keep the center 
 
-P-A-G-E-447
  PERSONALITY AND ITS DISTURBANCE 435 
of my visual field somewhere near the point where I was writing. 
I nieved my head upward when it should have gone downward; 
I moved it to the left when it should have gone to the right.’’ 
If one were judging the normality of Stratton’s behavior during 
the first day after the removal of the lenses from the superficial 
examination of his reactions alone and in ignorance of the causes 
of the maladjustment, one would draw very wrong conclusions 
as to his lack of balance and general condition. The visual 
reactions were undoubtedly sadly ‘‘out of touch with reality’’ 
but the disturbing factors were not present long enough nor 
under emotional conditions of such a nature as to involve the 
rest of his organized reactions. 
It is of course very difficult in the case of the normal adult 
whose habit and emotional reactions are highly stabilized to 
produce any serious and lasting effect upon personality by the 
introduction of temporary disturbing factors. In the case of 
the neurotic individual even temporary factors involving the 
emotions may reduce the total organized reaction system to the 
level of that of the infant, as is abundantly testified in the cases 
of shell shock. 
It is during infaney and youth that disturbing environ- 
mental factors work their most serious and lasting consequences. 
The Discarding and Readjusting of Reaction Systems.— 
During the whole process of human development from infaney 
to old age, but principally in youth, there goes on not only the 
process of acquisition of habit and the modification of hereditary 
reaction but also and equally important that of the elimination 
of reaction systems which work only up to a certain age. Old 
situations give way to new and as the situation changes old 
ways of reacting should be cast off and, new ones formed. No 
normal youngster after a few months of walking slips back to 
his crawling habits, nor will an older one exhibit his old organized 
behavior with respect to his blocks and toys after he has learned 
to use tools. The habits put on in the year gone by simply will 
not work in the year to come. This is as true with respect to 
our social activities as to our daily response to objects. The 
friends of our mature years are as a rule not the friends of 
 
-P-A-G-E-448
en ee 
436 PSYCHOLOGY 
our childhood and adolescence. The casting-off process is not 
an active one but is brought about almost solely by the fact 
that as age comes on the social and physical environment changes 
and new habits must be put on if the individual is to remain 
adjusted to changing conditions. Unquestionably the complete- 
ness with which old habits and the emotional factor connected 
with them which do not work are put away when the new situa- 
tion is faced, tremendously modifies the type of personality each 
individual develops into. When the individual is constantly 
faced by new situations which it can meet, as is normally the 
ease, and when the reaction systems to be outgrown have not 
been too thoroughly ingrained by bad surroundings, the old 
order gives way to the new with no scarring and without detri- 
mental factors appearing, but where heredity is bad, where there 
is sickness in childhood and overindulgence or carelessness in 
the parents the new orders of habit are put on with the greatest 
difficulty. The individual then remains hampered by his past. 
Possibly no one of us escapes unscathed through the childhood 
and adolescent stages. The early situations when again faced 
by the adult may not call out the overt infant reactions but 
they do not wholly lose their power to stir up the old implicit 
emotional activity. The most convincing evidence for this view 
comes from psychopathology, but daily life gives us also con- 
vincing evidence. A great many individuals have water-tight 
compartments filled with old reaction systems which resist the 
storm and stress of adult life. Early religious and social training 
is modified with difficulty or not at all. Ways of talking and 
thinking about things learned at the mother’s knee remain some- 
times unmodified to the bitter end. New situations cannot be 
reacted to properly until modification occurs—the old habits 
will not work in the new environment but the old will not give 
place to the new. The individual thus remains in a permanently 
unadjusted state. A few illustrations may help in understand- 
ing how thwarted tendencies arise and how personality is influ- 
enced by them. One individual becomes a psychologist in spite 
of his strong interest in becoming a medical man because at 
the time it was easier for him to get the training along psycho- 
   
-P-A-G-E-449
  PERSONALITY AND ITS DISTURBANCE 437 
logical lines. Another pursues a business career when if it were 
possible he would become a writer of plays. Sometimes on account 
of the care of the mother or of younger brothers and sisters a 
young man cannot marry even though the mating instinct is 
normal. Such a course of action necessarily leaves frustrated 
impulses in its train. Again, a young man will marry and settle 
down when mature consideration would show that his career 
would advance much more rapidly if he were not burdened with 
a family. Another individual marries and without phrasing it 
in words even to himself that his marriage is a failure he 
gradually shuts himself off from any emotional expression, pro- 
tects himself from the married state by substituting for natural 
domestic ties some kind of engrossing work, but more often 
hobbies, speed manias and excesses of various kinds. In connec- 
tion with this it is interesting to note how rapidly women rushed 
into all kinds of, work during the recent war. Women in the 
present state of society have not the same access to absorbing 
kinds of work that men have, hence the chances of their out- 
growing their adolescence are more limited than in men. If we 
are right in this analysis these unexercised tendencies to do 
things other than we are doing are never quite got rid of nor could 
we get rid of them unless we could build ourselves over again. 
These maladjustments are exhibited whenever the brakes are 
off—that is, whenever our adult habits of speech and action are 
functioning at a low level as in sleep, day-dreaming and in 
emotional disturbances. For this reason the dream and the 
slips and accidents of everyday life become of importance in 
studying personality. 
The development of many but not all of these blocked 
tendencies can be traced to childhood or adolescence, which is a 
period of strain and excitement. In childhood we often see the 
boy reacting to his mother in some respects like his father. The 
girl likewise becomes closely attached to her father and reacts 
to him as her mother would under certain cireumstances. These 
tendencies from the standpoint of popular morality are perfectly 
“innoeent.’’? But as children grow older they learn from one or 
another source that such ways of reacting are either ‘‘wrong’’ or 
   
-P-A-G-E-450
  438 PSYCHOLOGY 
unusual ; then the process of discarding and replacement is 
necessary. The replacement or substitution is often very imper- 
fect. The apostle’s saying ‘‘when we become men we put away 
childish things’’ was written before the days of modern psychol- 
ogy. We do not put them away—we replace them but they 
never for us completely lose their impulsive power. Parents 
who show excessive emotional reactions toward their children— 
over much fondling of them—often encourge such reactions 
and make normal substitution more difficult. Later on in life 
the old habit systems may show themselves in overt ways. Now 
and then we find a young man whose mother has long since 
died who can find little attraction in the girls with whom he 
associates. He himself can advance no reason for this apathy ee a : 
and would, possibly become angry if the true explanation were 
sffered him. In a similar way adults may become too much 
attached to children. This is often seen in the case of a woman 
whose husband has died leaving her with an only son. The son 
becomes substituted for the father and her reactions which 
she looks upon as those belonging merely to a devoted mother 
soon take on certain characteristics of those she would show 
to her husband. 
These illustrations have all been chosen from the sphere of 
normal life. They give us an insight into the character and 
personality of individuals. They- show that in order to under- 
stand a person’s weaknesses and strength we have to have more 
than a superficial acquaintance with him. €Character and 
personality are not formed over night nor are they of mushroom- 
like growth. In summary it seems safe to generalize: youthful, 
outgrown and partially discarded habit and instinctive systems 
of reaction can and possibly always do influence the functioning 
of our adult systems of reaction and influence to a certain extent 
even the possibility of our forming the new habit systems which 
we must reasonably be expected to form. 
Psychopathological Aspects of Habit Distortion.—As psy- 
chologists studying normal behavior we shall venture only so 
far into the realm of psychopathology as to trace the connection 
between habit distortion discussed above and the psychiatrist’s 
conception of what he calls a ‘‘mental disease.’’ As is well known,
-P-A-G-E-451
PERSONALITY AND ITS DISTURBANCE 439 
there is a growing tendency on the part of modern psychopathol- 
ogists to break away from the pathologists’ conception of disease 
in those patients suffering from personality disturbance. When 
the pathologist and physiologist visit the psychiatric hospital 
they are likely at once to cast around for an adequate explana- 
tion of the patient’s condition in terms of brain cell lesions, 
infections, intoxications and the like. It is as unthinkable to 
many of them as it is to the man on the street that an adequate 
account of the patient’s disease from a causal standpoint can 
be given without appeal to pathology, to physiology or to med- 
ical chemistry. Many believe that in such eases (the purely 
functional cases) the neurological and chemical tests should and 
must necessarily show some variation from the normal, and when 
no such organic disturbance can be found they insist that the 
changes are there but are of so delicate a nature that they 
escape observation. Possibly this may be true in some cases, 
but the conviction is growing that no organic lesions need be 
found to account for the facts and that when found they are not 
necessarily the important factors. In other words, we can have a 
diseased personality arising through habit distortion—distor- 
tion carried to the point where the compensatory factors (ser- 
viceable habits) are not sufficient to carry the individual along 
in society. He is out of touch with his environment and unless 
help is given him he will most certainly go down under 
competition. As we have pointed out, the habit distortions may 
and do often start in infancy. The indulgent mother favors a cer- 
tain child, allows it to eat what it wants, to play with what it calls 
for, puts no authority upon it, does everything for it and even 
anticipates its demands. Under such a regime walking and talk- 
ing are delayed. Crying, yelling, kicking and screaming are 
resorted to when demands are denied. During boyhood he is petted 
and spoiled. His side is taken whenever the other boys attempt to 
give him the knocks that would straighten him out. His studies 
are not enforced, he is not taught to work, to earn extra pennies 
or to accept his share of responsibility. Lying and cheating are 
not early enough dealt with. Normal burden bearing and respon- 
sibility for his own mishaps are not inculeated. As long as the 
old favoring environment lasts he floats, but when a crisis oceurs,
-P-A-G-E-452
  440 | PSYCHOLOGY 
assets with which to do it. His equipment is inadequate. The 
world is full of such floating wrecks, many of which owing to 
favorable environment never reach a psychiatric clinic. The 
war brought some interesting cases. One possibly may be 
mentioned. The draft caught a man thirty-five years of age 
of robust constitution. The father had died during the infancy 
of this individual. The mother was distraught and petitioned 
Congress and the President direct to get him out of the service 
on the ground that he was ‘‘her baby’’ and that she had had to 
sleep with him every night since his birth. While the thirty-five- 
year-old baby was at home the mother kept herself well groomed 
and was generally alert and cheerful. After his entrance into the 
service she grew slovenly and despondent. Having some wealth 
and influence she finally succeeded in getting her son discharged, 
whereupon the happy relationship was again resumed. Without 
much question another six months of life without the son would 
, have brought the mother to a clinic. Both of these individuals 
have diseased personalities as ravaging in their effects as tuber- 
culosis or cancer. But it is futile to hunt for any organic dis- 
turbance. They are in the state they are in because of the kinds 
of adjustment which were never put aside at normal times. The 
proof that personality disturbances are due to long-continued 
behavior complications and not to organic disturbances appears 
from the fact that in many cases, under new and suitable environ- 
ment the old reactions can be broken down and new ones 
entrained. The individual is made over from a reaction stand- 
point and takes his normal place in society. The re-training 
(‘‘eure’’), although more difficult, is neither more nor less mys- 
terious and wonderful than teaching the infant to reach for candy 
and to withdraw his hand from a candle flame. 
Concluding Statements.—Our personality is thus the result 
of what we start with and what we have lived through. It is the 
‘¢reaction mass’’ as a whole. The largest component of the mass 
if we are normal consists of clean-cut and definite habit systems, 
instincts that have yielded to social control and emotions which 
have been tempered and modified by the hard knocks received 
in the school of reality. when he is tc to face the world unaided, he has not the

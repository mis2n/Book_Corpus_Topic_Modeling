No nation ever contained more extensive or more valu- 
able virgin forests than did the United States even a 
century ago. These forests, with little or no thought on 
the part of Americans of their importance in the life of a 
nation, or of their replacement for future timber, have 
been largely removed. States that once were the chief 
producers of lumber for the general markets, with the dis- 
appearance of their forests, are now paying high prices for 
lumber shipped to them, often for hundreds of miles, for 
their own needs. The only two considerable timber 
sources left in the United States are the Gulf States 
and the Pacific Northwest. These in less than fifty years 
will be exhausted. We must from now on grow our own 
timber. We are cutting it more than four times as fast 
as it is being produced. Forest fires, indiscriminate clear- 
ing and grazizg are responsible causes in forest de- 
pletion. Correction of these evils will come only through 
an enlightened public. It is necessary for a people to un- 
derstand the fundamental relation between forests and a 
well ordered national life. Agriculture, stream flow, birds 
and wild life, timber for home building, for railroad cross 
ties, for marketing crops, and for many other necessities, 
are dependent upon forests. They are one of the basic re- 
sources and must be guarded. 
fhe object of this little book is to present in as interest- 
ing a way as possible some of the primary, but fundamental 
facts about trees and forests. Children of the grammar

school grades know nothing of commercial values and 
complicated problems involved in forest economics, but 
they can grasp the idea that trees are useful, struggling, 
living things that are friends to us all in providing shade, 
in yielding lumber with which to build our houses; in fur- 
nishing homes for birds and wild life; in protecting our 
streams and in supplying many classes of useful articles 
impossible for them to do without. They will learn, there- 
fore, that trees are benefits to protect and to respect rather 
than objects to abuse and destroy. It is through the grasp 
of ideas like these that the more involved relations of for- 
ests and man’s welfare will be later understood. 
The authors hope through this little book to inspire a 
patriotic respect for forests since they are the very heart 
and life of a nation’s prosperity. Schooling often stops 
with the grammar grades. We cannot afford to permit, 
through neglect, uninstructed individuals innocently to 
waste the waning forests of our country. The child is our 
future citizen. Conservation of America’s resources must 
rest with him. Let us make him intelligent to assist in 
handling this all important problem,

2 CHAPTER I 
OUR DEPENDENCE ON WOOD 
No doubt all of you have heard the old saying: ‘One 
never misses water until the well becomes dry.’’ Can you 
explain why this saying is true? 
If All Wood Were Banished.—Suppose some evil spirit 
should be given the power to banish instantly from the 
world all the wood and things made of wood, and this spirit 
should decide to do this some night when we are asleep. 
Can you imagine how surprised we should be in the morn- 
ing and how inconvenient it would be for everybody ? 
First of all, many, many people, all of us, would awake to 
find ourselves out in the cold. Even people who live in stone, 
brick, or cement block houses would find the floors, the 
doors, the windows, and the roofs gone. If the bedsteads 
were of wood, we should find ourselves on our mattresses 
and springs on the bare ground, or perhaps in the cellar, 
if the house had a basement. 
Can you picture the difficulty the mothers would have 
getting breakfast? The stove would be left, of course, and, 
although it might be in the basement along with many other 
iron things, it could be set up again. But what {fuel could be 
used for cooking our breakfast? If the stove burned wood 
or coal, it would be of no use to us. Coal is made from wood 
or other vegetation that has been buried for millions of 
years. Gas made from coal would also have vanished. Can 
you think of any other sources of heat? Even if we had 
I
-P-A-G-E-12
2 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
natural gas in our neighborhood and had a gas stove, we 
should have difficulty in lighting the gas. How could 
matches be used if the wood had disappeared ? 
And where should we place our dishes? All the furniture 
in our homes is made of wood. Of course we could stand 
up and eat our breakfast or sit down on the ground or the 
basement floor. 
Out-of-doors we should see many changes. All frame 
buildings would be gone. In the country there would be no 
barns, no rail fences, no fence posts. Where once there 
had been a wagon or carriage, there would be only a heap 
of iron. 
You would have no books. Readers, arithmetics, spellers, 
geographies, histories, dictionaries, and encyclopedias, 
story books—all would have vanished. In fact, a large part 
of the books of the whole world would be gone, for nearly 
all the paper used in the United States and other countries 
is made from wood. Can you imagine how hard it would 
be for your teacher to instruct you? What a terrible loss to 
our large libraries, where there are many, many thousands 
of books! In our Library of Congress at Washington, D. 
C., which is the third largest in the world, there are more 
than 3,000,000 printed books and pamphlets. All those 
whose paper is made from wood pulp would have disap- 
peared. Men and women have worked many years to pre- 
‘pare some of our books. Much of the work of all the writ- 
ers who have ever lived would be lost. 
The boys and girls would be inconvenienced greatly in 
their games. There would be no baseball bats, no hockey 
sticks, no shinny sticks, no skis. The sleds would be gone. 
The smaller children would have no wagons, no doll car- 
riages, no scooters. New games would have to be devised.
-P-A-G-E-13
  OUR DEPENDENCE ON WOOD 3 
How would this act of the evil spirit affect our railroads? 
The steel rails would be left. But would it not be dangerous 
for trains to travel on them without wooden ties? What 
material is used in freight cars, in passenger coaches? Are 
railroad bridges made of wood or of steel? Which material 
is used in the bridges near your home? Stations and depots 
would suffer like our houses. Airplanes could not fly; many 
ships on the rivers, lakes, and oceans would disappear. 
As for communication, nearly all the telegraph and tele- 
phone wires and the wires of many electric power lines 
would be lying on the ground. Think what great hard- 
ships this would work on people. The radio could:still be 
used, but some parts of this would be gone. 
Can you think of any other losses to the people? 
All in all, we should be inconvenienced more than we 
realize, and put to great trouble to get substitutes for the 
wood. Substitutes could be found, but often they would 
be costly, and in most cases not be so good as wood. Iron 
would be a substitute much used. Would you like to see 
iron doors, iron roofs, iron houses, iron tables, iron chairs? 
Do you not think that wood is much prettier and easier 
to handle? 
Possible Shortage of Wood.—We shall always have some 
wood, for no evil spirit will ever exist to take it from us. But 
we are using up our wood faster than we are growing it. It 
is getting scarcer and scarcer every year. Our children and 
grandchildren are going to find wood very expensive and 
will use more substitutes than we do. We who are living 
now have a right to use all that we need, but we have no 
right to waste it in any way, for if we waste it, we are mak- 
ing wood more costly for ourselves and more costly for the 
men and women who will live in the next generation. Do

you think it would be right for a father to destroy a good 
tree which he did not need, especially when he knew that 
his son would be needing that tree and its wood when the 
son grew to bea man? The need for conserving our wood 
supply will be discussed fully in a later chapter. (See Chap- 
ter XI.) 
Use Made of Wood by Pioneers in the Forested Area.— 
You will learn in your history books that nearly all the early 
settlements in our country were made on the Atlantic 
Coast. From these settlements the people spread westward. 
The pioneers generally built their houses of logs and fur- 
nished-them complete with homemade wooden furniture. 
These log houses after a time were replaced by frame houses, 
for the most part, although brick and stone were used to 
some extent. 
Until the pioneers in moving westward got far beyond 
the Mississippi River, they had plenty of wood to use. (See 
Figures t and 2.) Indeed, the forests were really in their 
way, for it was necessary to till the soil to get enough food 
for everybody. So vast areas of forests were cut down and 
the trees burned in great log heaps. Of course the pioneers 
were justified in doing this, for they had to clear the land 
for farms. The great abundance of wood in the past in 
our country has had one bad effect on us. Most people 
think that we still have vast stores of it. 
Need for Wood in the Grasslands.—When our Ameri- 
can pioneers reached the grasslands in the central United 
States, they first came to realize the great usefulness of 
wood. (Figures 1 and 2 show the grassland regions of 
North America.) Ask your teacher to locate these grass- 
lands on a map in your geography. For a time in Illinois, 
for example, the pioneers did not settle on the grasslands,

North America. 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
    6 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
but remained in the forested lands in the eastern part of 
the State. They thought that the soil of the grasslands was 
not fertile. If a soil would nct grow trees, it was not fertile 
enough, they believed, to grow crops. They soon found, 
however, that grassland scil is rich, and then there came a 
rush for farms on the prairies, as the grasslands are called 
in this and other near-by States. 
But these early settlers on the prairies were greatly in- 
convenienced at first, because they had no lumber with 
which to build their houses and barns and fences. Until 
railroads were built, many prairie sections were not settled, 
because lumber was not available, except at great cost. 
Many people built sod houses. The wooden timbers needed 
to hold up the roof of sod or thatch were obtained from the 
cottonwood trees that grew on the near-by river bottoms 
or flood plains. Doors and window frames and sashes— 
few people had them in their sod houses—were brought 
from long distances. 
Sod houses were very common once in Iowa, northern 
Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska. As soon as railroads were 
built extending out into the great prairie and grassland 
regions from the forested lands to the east, and lumber 
could be had, people replaced their sod houses with wooden 
ones. Why are frame houses superior to those of sod? 
The lumber had to be shipped long distances, some of it for 
hundreds of miles. Lumber was brought from the forests 
of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. In the South, 
eastern Texas furnished lumber for the Black Prairies and- 
other grasslands of central Texas, and still does. The secur- 
ing of fence material on the grasslands has always been 
a problem. Some farmers at first made sod fences, but 
these were not very serviceable. Eventually wire fences

8 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
came to be used because they require only a small amount 
of wood for the posts. 
Need for Wood in Desert Lands.—In the desert lands 
(Figures 1 and 2 show the desert regions of North Amer- 
ica) people find great difficulty in getting wood for build- 
ings. Sun-dried brick, called adobe brick, and stone are 
generally used. Burned brick is rarely used, for there is no 
wood to burn the clay. Wooden beams are necessary to 
hold up the roofs. These are secured from the forests on the 
mountain slopes and in most cases have to be carried scores 
of miles. 
For hundreds of years before America was discovered 
many Indian tribes of New Mexico and Arizona built adobe 
or stone houses; and white man to-day finds that such 
houses are the best and cheapest to build in that. part of 
the country. All over the world in desert areas man finds 
the same difficulty in getting lumber for his buildings, and 
hence uses sun-dried brick or stone or merely tents. But 
no matter what sort of habitation he builds, some wood is 
needed. 
Need for Wood-in Arctic Lands.—The people who live in 
the far north, on the shores of the Arctic Ocean (see Fig- 
ure 1), find great difficulty in getting wood. Locate the 
Arctic Ocean on this map of North America. Study the 
map to see if it tells how far north the forests of North 
America extend. Because of the scarcity of wood in the far 
north country, the Eskimos have learned to build snow 
huts for their winter homes and in summer they live in 
skin tents. They, however, make some use of wood. It is 
necessary for tent poles, for their dog sleds, and for spear 
handles. To get these few pieces, some of the natives travel, 
during the summer, far to the south to the edge of the
-P-A-G-E-19
    
OUR DEPENDENCE ON WOOD 9 
forest. The Eskimos often make long journeys to find a 
piece of driftwood on the shores of the Arctic Ocean. They 
are full of joy when they find a pile of driftwood on the 
shores of the ocean, for they can usually get pieces that 
fill their needs and the long journey inland to the forests 
is not necessary. The driftwood has floated northward on 
the waters of the rivers that rise in the forest lands to the 
south. Can you name one river that probably carries drift- 
wood northward in North America? The currents along 
the shore of the ocean often carry the wood scores of miles 
from the mouths of the rivers and leave it on headlands. 
Trees Supply Many of Our Needs.—You have learned 
earlier in your study of geography that all people have three 
primary needs. We have need for food, for clothing, and for 
shelter. Do trees furnish us food? What trees? In tropical 
countries many of the natives make excellent garments from 
the bark of trees. In what parts of the world do people use 
wood almost exclusively for homes ? 
There are other needs, called higher needs, that must be 
satisfied, or life would be dull indeed. Is wood used in any 
form in playing polo, tennis, basket-ball, croquet, golf, 
checkers, chess? We have seen its great need in some games 
and sports. Civilized people also need churches, libraries, 
colleges, books, and pictures. Wood in some form aids in 
many ways in providing the means for satisfying these 
higher needs. 
Did you, before reading this chapter, ever suppose that 
wood was so valuable to man? Could we get along without 
gold? What useful things are made of gold? What of silver ? 
How useful are diamonds? Is not wood more useful, and, 
therefore, more important to man than any of these three 
things that we consider valuable?

  CHAPTER II 
THE STORY OF A TREE 
This tree is a great white oak which grows near the edge 
of a small field that lies at the top of one of the bluffs of the 
Cumberland River in middle Tennessee. Its trunk is so 
large, its branches reach out so far, it lifts its head into the 
air so high, and it stands out so prominently among all the 
other smaller neighboring trees, that it isa landmark. All 
the neighborhood people know it well and call it the “big 
oak.” Even strangers, some from great distances, notice it 
and remark about its “majesty” and “‘its rustic beauty.” 
Like all other oaks it started, more than two hundred 
years ago, as a tiny acorn. Let us begin our story the day 
the acorn fell from the mother tree. 
The Planting of the Acorn.—A great storm which had 
raged for hours had passed. The wind and rain had torn off 
thousands of leaves and acorns, for it was the early fall 
when trees are ready to drop their acorns. These were 
strewn over the ground beneath and all about the mother 
tree. Some acorns had rolled far down the bluff, and others 
had been carried away by the tiny streams that coursed 
down the hillside. If the mother tree could have spoken— 
but of course trees cannot think or talk—it would probably 
have said: “Well, now I have done my duty this year, now 
I shall rest until the warm rains and bright sunlight of 
spring start my leaf-buds.” And it might have said with 
great truthfulness: “I suppose only a few of my crop of 
It

acorns, my children, will ever get planted and grow up to 
be as large as am. For three centuries I have been produc- 
ing acorns, some years thousands of them, trying to popu- 9 
late this territory with oaks. Yet I see few daughter trees.”
-P-A-G-E-23
THE STORY OF A TREE 13 
But it did not say this, for it could not talk, and, if it could 
have talked, it would not have complained; for this is the 
way of nature. Only a small number of the seeds which 
a plant produces each year ever grow. Some plants pro- 
duce only a few seeds, but others produce thousands and 
even hundreds of thousands. 
As usual, hardly had the storm passed before large birds, 
like jays and woodpeckers, began their feast and the squir- 
rels from near-by assembled and started their work of storing 
up their winter food in the hollows of trees. Large animals, 
like the deer, also made many a lunch on the acorns, and 
worms began to burrow in some. In the course of a few 
weeks hardly a hundred remained sound, and these had, by 
accident, been hidden. A few had been pushed into the 
ground by the deer. Some, which had rolled far down the 
bluff, had lodged in depressions in the ground or in the 
leaves, and the little hillside streams had covered others 
with the sand and mud they were carrying. 
The Sprouting of the Acorn.—During the long winter 
which followed, a few had been uncovered and had so dried 
that the germ of life in the kernel was destroyed. Those 
which had been’kept cool and moist during the winter began 
to show life as the warm spring rains came. Air as well as 
water was absorbed, for plants must have air and water as 
we do. The meaty part of the kernel began to swell, the 
shell was split, and the little plant, or embryo, which had 
been packed away so carefully in the nut, began to push out. 
Its nourishment for many days was taken from the meaty 
part of the seed. First a root came, and this pushed its way 
downward. No matter what the position of the acorn (or, 
for that matter, of any seed) is, this first root, strange to 
say, grows downward. It is also very sensitive to moisture, .
-P-A-G-E-24
    14 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
and will always grow in the direction of water, if any is 
near. After a time this root of the acorn we are considering 
came to have root hairs (see Figure 4) which absorbed the 
moisture from the soil. After the root had grown to be two 
or more inches long, and was firmly anchored in the soil and 
was absorbing water, a tiny stem, the leafy part of the 
embryo, pushed upward and out into the air. True leaves 
at length appeared, first creamy in color, then green, and 
the plant began to make its own food. 
Making Plant Food.—Would you like to know how 
plants make their food? Many people think that plants get 
all their food from the ground. This is not quite correct. It 
is only water, and the mineral matter that is dissolved in the 
water, that comes from the ground. These move up the 
stem to the leaves. The leaves have pores by means of which 
air, which has carbon dioxide in it, gets to the interior of 
the leaf. (See Figures 4 and 5.) 
Here the water and the carbon dioxide are united by 
means of the sunlight, which is caught by the green coloring 
matter of the leaves, and starch is made. Some of this 
starch is united with some of the mineral matter, and, in 
some way not yet well known, proteid food results. Starch 
(which has been changed to sugar) and proteid material 
move along tiny tubes toward the growing parts of the tree. 
Here they are used to make bark or wood or other plant 
tissue. The growth of plants is thus one of the great wonders 
of nature, and it has taken men and women many scores 
of years to understand some of the secrets of growth. 
Much study is yet to be done. 
Growth of the Young Oak.—The young oak now had a 
good start, and, all during the spring and early summer, 
rains furnished moisture for the roots, and the leaves made 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
THE STORY OF A TREE 15 
starch and proteid matter for the growing parts. By the 
close of the summer, the oak had reached a height of a few 
inches. But it was yet tender, for hard bark had not devel- 
oped, and its green stem had only a thin covering.

An Accident to the Young Oak.—Late in the winter a 
great calamity befell the tiny oak. A hungry deer came 
through the forest in search of food and, finding nothing 
better, nibbled off the tender top of this tiny oak. Our oak, 
however, owing to the healthy growth of the previous sum-

mer, was not killed, and late the following spring leaves 
again appeared.on the lower part of the stem, new branches 
came out, and the little oak grew. 
Bark, Cambium, and Wood.—After a time hard bark, 
thin at first but thicker with each succeeding year, was 
formed. This protected the stem and older branches from -

tree aged, it grew thicker and became rough. Rough bark 
is dead layers of bark. If you study carefully the end of a 
piece of wood, two or three inches in diameter, cut from a 
limb or a small tree, you will find the various layers shown 
in Figure 6. On the dutside is dead bark made up of layers,

living bark is soft and spongy, and is called bast. The inner 
layer of the living bark is called the cambium layer. This 
is the most important part of the tree, though it makes up 
only a small part of the cross-section, for it is the growing

probably remember that the wood, after the bark is re- 
moved, is smooth and slippery. The inside of the bark is also 
smooth and slippery, and this slippery portion is the cam- 
bium layer. The fragrant, slimy part of the bark of slippery 
elm is cambium. Inside the cambium layer, 7. e., toward the 
centre, is the sapwood, which also is made up of several 
layers or rings, each ring of which represents the growth of 
one year. The remainder of the woody part of the tree is 
heartwood. This is dead wood. When oaks (or almost any 
trees in the temperate zone) reach the age of ten or more 
years all these parts may be clearly seen.

shaped, with little feathers projecting from one end, and is 
called the pistillate flower. The other, much prettier, is 
called the staminate flower, and is made up of scores of tiny 
flowers arranged along thread like fibres two and one-half to 
three inches long. These staminate flowers look like tas- 
sels. In a few days after the flowers on our oak bloomed, 
a brownish powder was formed in the staminate flowers. 
Some of this was carried by the wind to the /istillate 
flowers. In time a part of the pistillate flowers increased in 
size, and in early summer began to take on the form and 
appearance of acorns. The oak tree now passed from 
maidenhood to motherhood, and at intervals, thereafter, 
for about 180 years, it flowered and produced crops of 
acorns. Yet its family increased only slowly, for nearly 
every acorn was destroyed, carried away and eaten by 
birds, squirrels, deer, and other animals. If, by accident, 
any ever did become planted and sprout, they were likely 
to be killed by grazing animals, to be eaten by worms, or 
to die for want of water or light. 
New Enemies.—About one hundred years ago—the tree 
at this time was one hundred years old and very large—new 
enemies appeared in Middle Tennessee. Men came with 
axes and saws and fire, chopping, sawing, and burning. 
They were clearing their land to make way for their crops. 
Of course, they had a perfect right to remove the forests, 
for if the corn, wheat, potatoes, and other crops were more 
valuable to them than trees, trees must give way for these 
crops. On all the level land great trees were felled, sawed 
into logs, rolled into great heaps, and burned. Many an 
oak, hickory, walnut, poplar, ash, and elm fell and was re-

duced to ashes. Our oak tree, however, standing but a 
short distance back from a high bluff was spared, for it is 
always dangerous to remove the vegetation on or near 
steep slopes. Rain water washes off the top soil, and the 
hillside streams, that flow very rapidly during and after 
each heavy rainfall, cut gullies and thus destroy the land 
and make it unfit for cultivation. The farmer, on whose 
land the oak stood, knew what would likely result, so’ he 
spared the sturdy oak and a few smaller trees about it. 
With the coming of man, the deer and other animals that 
ate the acorns fled. The squirrels remained, but their num- 
ber decreased for they were shot for food or chased away 
by dogs. Cattle and pigs replaced the deer as enemies of 
the acorns. The pig was the greediest of them all, and for a 
part of the year almost its entire food was acorns. 
The Oak Survives Many Dangers.—Two hundred years 
is a long time to live. White men were just beginning to 
make settlements back from the eastern coast of North 
America, and nearly all of what is now the United States 
was a wilderness when the acorn, which grew into this great 
tree, was planted. Its life has not been very eventful, no 
more so than that of most trees. It, like other large trees, 
as we have seen, has lived in spite of many enemies and 
dangers that might have destroyed it. ‘ 
The dangers were most numerous when the oak was 
young. You have seen that this acorn was only one suc- 
cessful one out of thousands and thousands. Animals and 
the weather, were its enemies when it was young. As it 
grew older, still there were dangers. All about it, during its 
long life, many, many trees were destroyed. Tornadoes 
destroyed some; lightning struck others and tore them into 
a thousand splinters; ice and snow so weighted the branches
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE STORY OF A TREE 2X 
of some that they broke. ‘Larger trees in falling often de- 
stroyed smaller ones about them. Some trees lost branches 
from various causes, and bacteria and fungus growths pene- 
trated the dead heartwood of many and caused decay. 
Insect pests—beetles and grubs of beetles of various kinds 
—so ate the bark and wood of others as to weaken them. 
(See Chapter IV.) But this grand old oak escaped all these 
accidents. 
The Oak Gives Joy to Birds and People.—It gives joy to 
many. Picnic parties like to rest in its shade because there 
the summer winds always blow cool. One gets a wonderful 
view of the surrounding country from the top of the bluff 
near this tree, and from this point boys and girls love to 
look at the Cumberland River stretching across the land- 
scape like a gray green ribbon fringed with a darker green 
border of trees. 
The old oak is so lofty and raises itself so far above the 
younger surrounding trees that it is the resting place for 
nearly every bird that passes its way. In February one 
may see hundreds of robins on its branches, sometimes 
roosting there for the night on their long journey to the 
north. Gay and varicolored warblers in flocks often rest 
there on their migration. Juncos, chewinks, jays, mocking- 
birds, cardinals, and scores of others visit it, some making 
it their home. Squirrels visit it and partake of the acorns 
as they have been doing for about two centuries. 
How much longer will it live? No one can tell. Some 
oaks live a thousand years or more. Let us hope that 
this one will continue to be admired by people and give 
pleasure to men and birds and animals, and that it will 
‘escape all accidents for centuries to come.

  CHAPTER III 
SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT TREES 
SOME FAMOUS TREES 
Bo you know that there are a few trees in the world quite 
as famous as some of our famous men and women? The tree 
described in the chapter before this is a well-known tree, 
but it is not a famous tree. There are trees that are known 
by thousands of people and have been known for centuries. 
Some are famous because of their large size and their great 
age, and some because they have been associated withan 
historic event. 
The Big Trees of California.—The largest and oldest trees 
in the world are the Big Trees in California. The scientific 
name of this species of tree is Sequoia. There are a few 
groves of these Big Trees in deep valleys on the western 
slopes of the Sierra Nevada in California. Mammoth Grove 
has more than ninety large trees. The Sequoias can hardly 
be called beautiful because they have only scanty foliage. 
Their fame rests on their great size. Many are 300 to 350 
feet high and measure 25 to 35 feet through the trunk near 
the base. The top of a stump of one of these trees makes a 
fair-sized dancing platform, large enough for a score or 
more of couples. It takes three weeks for two men working 
steadily every day with an extra-long saw and axe to cut 
down one. The bark is fully two feet thick on the larger 
trees. It is interesting to know that many thousands of 
years ago the Sequoias grew in Europe, Asia, and various

parts of North America, but they were all destroyed ex- 
cept in a small area in California. The Big Trees will grow 
in Europe now and in parts of the eastern United States, 
but they are not so thrifty as in California. By counting 
the annual rings, men have learned that the oldest are 
from 2500 to 4000 years old.. Thus some of the larger ones 
were from 500 to 2000 years old at the time Christ was on 
earth. Thus they are the oldest living things on the earth 
to-day. ‘ 
A Big Tree in Mexico.—In Mexico there are cypresses or 
cedar trees of great size. One called the ‘“Cypress of. Mon- 
tezuma”’ is about forty feet in diameter at the base. When 
Cortez entered the country in 1519 this cypress was a very 
large tree. It is probably at least 2000 years old. 
Famous Trees in Europe.—There are. oaks, elms, and 
chestnuts equally as famous as the trees described. above. 
England has many very old oaks. The trunk of one in 
eastern England is thirty-eight feet in circumference. It 
seems not to have grown much during the last 209 years. 
Another in England is more than forty-seven feet around. 
It has been known for centuries as “the great oak.” » Both 
of these are probably two thousand, or more, years old: 
A Famous Oak.—Charter Oak, in Hartford, Connecti- 
cut, was a very old tree when the English colonists hid 
their charter in its hollow trunk in 1687 to keep it from 
their royal governor. The Indians had learned to love it, 
and had asked the settlers not to cut it when the land 
where Hartford now stands was being cleared by Thomas 
Hooper and his colonists to make way for farm crops. They 
said their ancestors for generations had planted their corn 
when the leaves of the old oak had grown to the size of a 
mouse’s ear and to them this tree was a harbinger of corn-

planting time. The English colonists very thoughtfully 
saved it. When it fell in 1856 during a great storm, the town 
went into mourning. Its exact location is now marked by a 
marble monument. 
Famous Elms.—The Treaty Elm on the banks of the 
Delaware fell in 1827. It was under this tree that William 
Penn made his treaty with the Indians. Beneath the Wash- 
ington Elm in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Washington took 
command of the little American army which later freed our 
country in the Revolutionary War. 
A Famous Chestnut.—Probably the most famous chest- 
nut of the world was the huge “Chestnut of a Hundred 
Horsemen,” which grew at the foot of Mt. Etna in Italy. 
It was so named because at one time one hundred men on 
horseback hid themselves within its hollow trunk. It had a 
diameter of more than sixty feet and was more than 2000 
years old when a volcanic eruption destroyed it. 
SOME COMMON TREES OF OUR COUNTRY 
The Hardwoods 
The Oaks.—Wherever one goes in the warmer part of the 
north temperate zone, where there is sufficient rain (about 
twenty-five inches or more) for trees, oaks will be seen. One 
finds them in western and southern Europe, in eastern Asia, 
and !n North America from southern Canada to northern 
Florida and westward into eastern Kansas and the Da- 
kotas and Iowa and again on the Pacific coast. They grow 
in many different sorts of surroundings. The Southern 
live oak grows only where the summers are hot and moist 
and where the winters are mild. The Western white oak 
grows in the western parts of Washington, Oregon, and 
northern California. Some (swamp white oak) grow where  
-P-A-G-E-35
THE MORE IMPORTANT TREES 25 
it is marshy, others where the ground is rocky or sandy and 
fairly dry. Since oaks thrive in many different kinds of 
places—habitats is the scientific word—one can readily see 
why there are so many different species of this tree. There 
are fifty species in the United States and about three hun- 
dred in the world. 
The more common species of oak found in our country 
are the white' oak, Southern red Gak, Northern red dak, 
black‘ ‘oak, scarlet te post “oak, basket or cow oak, and 
live dak. Besides these there are the willow‘ Bak, shingle’ or 
laurel oak, black jack, chestnut oak, and others. There are 
so many that only a few people really become familiar with 
all of them. How can we tell one from another or an oak 
from other trees? To do this one must study them carefully 
and note their differences. An American who has seen few 
Chinese may well say, ‘All Chinamen look alike to me” 
but when he comes to know Chinese people better he will 
see that any one Chinaman is as different from others as 
any one American is different from his fellows. So it is with 
trees. To some people one species of oak looks like all other 
oaks. Many people who do not take the time or trouble to 
study trees may not know oaks from maples or ashes. If 
we study trees carefully, we shall see that there are differ- 
ences in the bark, the shape of the leaf, the shape and size 
of the fruit or seed, the shape of the tree, and in the flowers. 
The best time of the year to study trees, in order to be able 
to identify them—tell their names—is in late summer or 
early fall before the leaves and nuts, if there are any, have 
fallen. 
To the boys and girls studying this book: 
The following paragraphs give the more important facts about 
the oaks that you may use in your attempts to identify them. You

are not expected to commit these facts to memory but to use them 
in your study of the trees. 
To the teacher: 
The authors would recommend that each class studying this text 
take as a project the naming of all the trees near the school building, 
say to the number of twenty-five or more. The trees could be 
tagged, or labelled with small strips of wood, or named on a map 
made to show the location of the several trees. Such a project 
would arouse a great deal of interest. Much assistance may be 
secured from farmers or lumbermen of your neighborhood.

White Oak (Quercus alba). 
The white oak is one of the most important timber trees 
in the eastern half of the United States. It sometimes 
attains a height of over a hun- 
dred feet and a diameter of 
three or four feet, but it more 
commonly reaches a height 
of sixty to one hundred feet 
and a djameter two to three 
feet. (In the open it has a 
heayy, broad top anda short 
body. But in close stands up 
to mgfe than half its height it 
has 4 long straight body with-

Fruit—An acorn about three-fourths of an inch long, 
matures same year the blossoms come; acorn set in 
shallow cup; hogs like this acorn. 
Wood—Hard, strong, heavy, close-grained, white to 
light brown in color, valuable for many uses. 
Northern Red Oak (Quercus borealis maxima). 
The Northern red oak is found in many States of the Union 
but occurs most abundantly in the Appalachian Moun- 
tains. As a forest tree it has a straight, long, clear trunk 
and a narrow top. 
Bark—Usually dark gray 
and smooth on young 
trees, but thick, tight, 
and broken by shallow 
fissures on the old trees. 
Leaves—Simple, alternate, 
commonly five to seven 
inches long and four to 
five inches wide, divided 
into pointed lobes ending 
in bristle like tips. Dull 
green on top, paler under- 
neath. Bright red after 
frost. 
Flowers—In clustered catkins in early spring, coming 
with the leaves. 
Fruit—A large acorn usually one inch long. Matures 
year following blossoming: thus old and young acorns 
are found on same limb. Acorn set in shallow cup. 
Wood—Hard, strong, coarse-grained, with a reddish tint 
to the heartwood. > 
The Southern Red Oak (Quercus rubra). 
The Southern red oak is found in many States east of the 
Rocky Mountains, reaching its best growth perhaps in 
Tennessee, southern Kentucky, northern Alabama, and 
northern Mississippi. Its usual height is from seventy 
to eighty feet with a diameter of two to three feet. As a

The Walnuts.—There are four kinds or species of wal- 
nuts in the United States, every one of which is of some ser- 
vice toman. They produce edible nuts and excellent timber. 
The bark and husk of the nuts of some are used for dyeing 
and for medicine. The English walnut is often planted for

a shade tree. On the Pacific coast it is grown in orchards or 
groves for the crops of excellent nuts which it, produces. 
Because of the excellence of the nuts, the English or Euro- 
pean walnut has been taken to many parts of the world. It

has been carried from Europe to China, Korea, and Japan, 
and to Chile. 
The black walnut is the best known of the walnuts in 
the eastern United States. This, when fully grown, reaches 
a height of 80 to 150 feet with a trunk four to six feet in di- 
ameter. The nuts have some commercial value and the 
timber is the finest of cabinet woods. 
The butternut, also known as white walnut, is a near 
relative of the black walnut. It does not grow to be so 
large as the black walnut and its branches are more spread- 
ing. The wood is far less valuable than that of the walnut. °
-P-A-G-E-41
  THE MORE IMPORTANT TREES - 31 
The tree is also called oil nut because of the large amount 
of oil in the yellow meat of the nut. Can you see any par- 
ticular reason for calling this walnut “butternut” ? 
Both the walnut and butternut grow in deep, rich, moist 
land. They, therefore, are numerous on river bottoms. 
The wise pioneers always preferred land that grew walnut 
and butternut trees if such land were to be found. 
FOR REFERENCE ONLY 
- Black Walnut (Juglans nigra). 
The biack walnut is an exceedingly valuable but scarce 
tree, growing in many States of the Union, particularly 
east of the Mississippi River. It often reaches one hun- 
dred feet in height and two to three feet in diameter, 
with a clear, straight body and short, round crown. But 
when growing alone it has a broad, heavy, open crown. 
The tree is easily propagated by planting the nuts, and 
grows rapidly on rich soil. Its long taproot makes it diffi- 
cull to dig up and transplant, even when a year or two 
old. 
Bark—Dark to black, rough, thick. The inside bark is 
white, but turns yellow when exposed. 
Leaves—Compound, alternate, usually from ten to four- 
teen inches long with from fifteen to nineteen leaflets 
each, two to three inches long, broad at the base and 
tapering to a point, with a strong, pungent odor when 
crushed. 
Flowers—Tasse! like, appearing when the leaves are about 
half grown. 
Fruit—A black nut with a rough, finely ridged surface, 
inclosed in a round, fleshy, green hull, which does not 
split so as to let out the nut. It contains a very palat- 
able kernel, which is used much in confections. 
Wood—Valuable, of high quality, heavy, hard, strong, 
durable, dark chocolate colored, takes a high polish.

The leaf of the butternut is very similar to that of the black 
walnut. The nui, however, is elongated and pointed at both 
ends. The outer coating is sticky when green. 
The Hickories.— These are America’s own trees, for they 
are not to be found growing wild in any other part of the 
world. There are fourteen species in North America, and 
it is said that eleven species are to be found in the state of 
Arkansas alone. The shellbark, or shagbark, hickory fur- 
nishes a very edible nut. In recent years the pecan, belong- 
ing tothe hickory family, has been planted in thousands of 
groves in the Southern States. The nut of the better varie- 
ties or kinds of pecans is without doubt the best nut on the 
market in our country. The shagbark hickory nut has much 
the same flavor, but the shell is harder to crack than the 
pecan and contains less meat. Hickory is an Indian name. 
The hickory nut was much used by the Indians for food 
and for oil, and many tribes gathered great stores of them 
in the fall for winter delicacies. Hickory-milk, made by 
pounding the meat of the nuts and mixing with water, 
made a seasoning or a sauce for meat and corn bread. 
Many pioneers in our country used hickory nuts much as 
the Indians did, but the quantity of hickory nuts con- 
sumed annually is gradually decreasing. 
The white hickory has a fairly smooth bark. The shell- 
bark, or shagbark, is so named because the bark comes off 
in strips one to two inches wide and three or more feet long. 
This bark is hard and tough and makes excellent firewood. 
The fruit of the white hickory, also known as the pignut, 
is a bitter nut. This is the finest of the hickories as a shade 
tree, because it holds its leaves until late fall, but it harbors 
many insect pests.

The scaly-bark hickory reaches a height of a hundred feet 
or more, and a diameter of two to three feet, and even 
four occasionally. In close stands it has a long, straight

and a short, round top. 
In the open it has a

important timber tree, 
growing mostly in 
States east of the Mis-

nut, sweet and with a delicate flavor. The beech is found 
mostly on the cool moist slopes of valleys, on the river bot- 
toms, or on flat uplands. The bark of the large trees, even 
two feet in diameter, is smooth. The beech tends to grow 
in pure Standage’ stands cover many acres. Rarely isa 
beech tree found alone and there are many reasons for this. 
The edible nuts are much liked by:squirrels and many sorts 
of birds, and these aid in the distribution of the seeds. The 
beech is also “tolerant”’* to shade. Thisis a characteristic 
favorable to growth, for young beeches can come up beneath 
the mother tree or other trees. Beeches come to be more 
numerous than other young trees, and when the older tree 
dies, they often take possession of the land on which this 
tree grew and over which its branches spread. Besides, 
the nut and the young plant are hardy and many reach 
maturity. The beech is an excellent shade tree and beech 
groves are very attractive. The nut furnishes an oil that is 
sweet and may be used for cooking. The leaves are eaten 
by cattle.

' The Chestnut.—The chestnut is a very well known tree 
in most parts of the eastern United States. It is particu- 
larly numerous in the highland sections of the South, where 
its wood has long been cut for making tannic acid. (See 
Chapter X for discussion of tannic acid and how it is made.) 
The tannic acid in the wood helps to preserve it from 
decay. The chestnut burrs, which are so troublesome to 
one’s fingers but which are easily opened if the nuts are 
ripe, are well known to people in the chestnut area. The 
Indians call the chestnut O-heli-yah-tah, which means 
prickly burr. For hundreds of years chestnuts, beechnuts, 
and acorns have been much prized by the farmers of many 
parts of Europe for feeding swine. They are known as mast, 
and are a clean, nutritious, fattening food. Chestnuts and 
beechnuts have long been used by man as food. The 
European chestnut, which furnishes nuts in great quantities 
to the people of the Mediterranean lands, is much like our 
American chestnut. The European nut is roasted or ground 
into flour for bread or a thickening for soups. Chestnuts 
are as common at fruit stands and groceries in southern 
Europe as peanuts are in the United States. Many farms 
in Spain and Italy have groves of chestnuts from which 
they get good crops of nuts. 
The chestnut is a beautiful shade tree. The foliage is a

The chestnut grows in almost all the States east of the

species are the red (also called swamp or soft), silver, and _ 
hard maple. The latter is also known as the rock maple, or 
the sugar maple, as it is the chief source of the sap used in 
making maple syrup and sugar. There are some nine species 
in North America and about one hundred in the world. 
Nearly all these have sweet sap, but the rock maple has the 
sweetest sap of them all. The maples are excellent shade 
trees. They grow rapidly, are fairly hardy, have a beautiful 
form when in leaf, are quite free from insect pests, retain 
- their leaves until late fall, and take on gorgeous autumnal 
coloring. 
FOR REFERENCE ONLY 
Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum). 
The sugar maple is often called the sugar tree, because 
maple sugar is made from its sap. It grows slowly, has a 
dense, symmetrical crown 
when in the open, and is thus 
much used for shade. It some- 
times has a long, straight 
trunk, clear of limbs for thirty 
or forty feet, and a diameter 
of two and one-half to three 
feet when grown in close 
stands with other trees. 
Bark—Smooth, light gray on 
young trees, but breaks into 
long scales in old trees, 
varying in color from gray 
to very dark. 
Leaves—Simple, opposite, 
usually three to five inches wide. Dark green on top, 
light green underneath. 
Flowers—Come with leaves in spring, greenish in color, 
at the end of thread like stalks.    pei

  The Poplars._-The yellow poplar or tulip tree is common 
in most parts of the country east of the Mississippi River. 
The tree is really not a poplar. It belongs to the magnolia 
family. The older trees in the forest are tall and graceful. . 
The namé tulip tree comes from the shape and color of 
the flower. The bracts (modified leaves), that look like 
petals, enclose the flower and remain on the tree until the 
fall, or later. The name yellow poplar comes from the color 
of the heart of the wood. The tree is also known as white- 
wood, because of the light color of the wood. The cotton- 
woods, of which there are several species, are true poplars, 
members of the willow family. The Carolina poplar grows 
best in moist, rich soil, and is found generally on river 
banks. When mature, the tree is tall, with few small

branches on the lower trunk or on the major branches. It 
can hardly be called a beautiful tree, because of its scraggly 
appearance. It seems to thrive fairly well in cities. The 
Western cottonwood is found along the streams of the 
Great Plains from Canada to Central Texas. Because of 
the scarcity of other trees, the Western cottonwood has been 
planted by the farmers of the Plains for wind breaks, shade, 
and ornament.

our country, but only about four that are common. These 
are white ash, red ash, black ash, and blue ash. The white 
ash is the most widely distributed of the four. It is 
commonly found growing on hill slopes that have a rich 
soil. The white ash, also called Canadian ash, grows rapidly 
and is sometimes used for planting about homes. But its 
leaves come out late in the spring, and fall early in autumn. 
The white ash reaches its greatest age and size in the North- 
ern States, where it may grow to a height of 75 to 125 feet. 
The black ash is a tree of wet lands, being found most 
often in swamps or on flood plains. It may grow in close 
stands and form black ash swamps. It is, therefore, not a

in the fall turns a rusty color and dies carly. The black ash 
is a short-lived tree. In almost any swamp large numbers of 
dead ashes may be seen not more than a foot in diameter. 
It is easily blown down, for its roots in swampy ground do 
not push their way deep into the earth, but, instead, spread 
out just beneath the surface.

42 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
The Black Locust.—This is a tree quite common in the 
Appalachian Highlands and the bordering lowlands. It is 
planted by man in most parts of the South, where it grows 
rapidly from seed and produces a hard, durable wood useful 
for many purposes but especially for fence posts. A single 
locust within a few years will surround itself with a thicket 
of locusts. Its root system is large and pushes out rapidly 
from the parent tree. From these roots numerous shoots 
come up and develop into trees. The roots serve to hold the 
soil and prevent, or at least check, erosion, or the washing 
away of soil. The black locust is planted in many parts of 
our country in the reclamation of gullied and washed lands. 
It is subject, however, to attacks by locust borers, which, 
in time, kill the tree or kill that portion of the tree attacked. 
The locust belongs to the pea family. Compare the shape 
of the bloom of the locust with that of the common garden 
pea.

Leaves—Compound, from six to ten inches long, with 
seven to nineteen leaflets. Oblong with rounded apex. 
Flowers—In clusters resembling in shape a cluster of 
grapes. Whitish cream in color. Fragrant. Contains 
honey, frequented by bees. Flowers appear in early 
spring. 
Fruit—A pod, two to five inches long, containing small 
bean like seeds. Seeds about one-eighth inch wide, 
three-sixteenths long. 
The sy caniore “Une sycamore is by some called the but- 
tonwood and by many the plane tree. The latter name is 
given it because very little of 
the dead bark remains on 
the tree. Only on the lower } 
part of the trunk does it en- 
tirely cover the whitish green 
under bark. The dead bark 
is more brittle than that of 
most trees, and as the un- 
der bark expands during 
growth the outer bark 
sloughs off. In the fall and 
winter these beautiful trees, 
  most numerous along the Fic. 23. Sycamore. Also called Buttonwood and America

Sycamores grow to great sizes, some 170 feet high, with
-P-A-G-E-54
  44 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
trunks five or six feet in diameter. The tree has few limbs. 
The trunk is usually divided into two or three widely 
spreading branches. It makes a poor shade tree, because 
the foliage is scant and also because the leaves drop early 
in the fall. The wood is little used because it is not dura- 
ble in contact with moisture and it splits with difficulty. 
Why is the sycamore called “buttonwood” ? 
The Elms.—There are about 140 species of elms in the 
world, but only a few important ones in the eastern United 
States. The white, or American, elm is the most common. 
This tree, because of its rapid growth, cleanliness, graceful 
form, and general freedom from insect pests, is much be- 
loved as a shade tree. However, the elm beetle, from which 
there is apparently no relief, in late years has harmed the 
elms to such an extent that they are not planted as fre- 
quently as in the past. Many an eastern American village 
owes its beauty to the great number of large elms, some 120 
feet or more in height, that border the streets. Travelling 
through these villages is like travelling through a large 
arched, leafy cathedral. The white elm grows best in 
moist soil but does well on dry uplands. The inner bark of 
the slippery, or red, elm has long been used in our coun- 
try for poultices. The cork elm, or rock elm, is common in 
the Northern and Eastern States and some parts of the 
South and resembles the white elm in most respects. The 
name comes from the small, wing like strips of corky bark 
that grow for a time on the younger branches.

  The Sweet Cunt The sweet gum is one of the more im- 
portant forest trees of the Southern States because of the 
many uses to which its wood may be put. (See Chapter IX.) 
The tree grows best, some to 140 feet, on the rich lands of 
the flood plains of rivers and creeks, but is found on the 
uplands. It is sometimes called star leaved gum because of 
the shape of the leaf. This is a most gorgeous tree in the 
fall when its leaves take on their autumnal colors, The 
name comes from the sweet sap of the tree.

The Birches.—Of the six birches in our country, the 
paper birch is probably best known to children in the 
eastern United States, because it is the tree that furnishes 
a parchment on which one may write. It is also called 
canoe birch, because the larger trees furnished a covering 
for canoes of the Indians in the Great Lakes region and New 
York, New England, and parts of Canada.* Several pieces 
were necessary for each canoe, the pieces being skilfully 
sewed together with fibres obtained from roots. The needle

holes and other holes in the bark were filled by gums, 
also obtained from the forest. While the birch bark canoe 
was so light that it could be carried readily, it was frail and 
had to be handled very carefully. Care was always taken 
to keep off the rocks, for the bark covering was easily 
punctured. How would the Indians embark or disembark 
ona rocky shore? 
Among the other birches are the gray or aspen leaved, 
the yellow (also called gray), the red or river, and the black. 
The latter is the tree most used for lumber. It takes a 
beautiful finish and stains well. Because it may be stained 
to imitate mahogany, it is also called by some mahogany 
birch. Why is it also called cherry birch? Black birch 
trees (very dark bark) are numerous in the forests of New 
_England and westward, but apparently find their best place 
for growth in the forests of Tennessee. The black birch will 
be found most often on moist land, particularly on the bor- 
ders of streams.

The Softwoods 
The Cedars.—All the trees discussed above are broad 
leaved or deciduous trees.* What is the meaning of decidu- 
ous? The deciduous trees are also known as hardwoods, 
no matter how soft the wood is. The cedars, pines, and the 
bald cypress are coniferous trees, and in the lumber business 
are called softwoods. 
The red cedar, or Virginia juniper, is a member of the 
pine family. It is found in many parts of the South. In 
middle Tennessee it forms large groves or glades on the 
cedar glade limestone where the soil is very shallow and 
so very dry in summer that one wonders where the tree gets 
any moisture. It grows here, not, as some people say, 
because it loves this habitat, but because it is shaded out 
in better soil by other trees that grow faster than it does, 
and because few other trees can grow where the soil is so 
thin as it is in the cedar glades. The leaves are of two 
kinds, both often on the same tree. One is awl-shaped, so 
* The larch and bald cypress are deciduous trees, but they are softwoods.

sharply pointed and stiff that the branches must be handled 
with care to avoid pain. The name “red cedar” comes 
from the color of the heartwood. The sapwood is nearly 
white. The wood is light in weight and fragrant. 
The white cedar grows from Maine southward to Florida 
on lowlands. It can grow even in brackish water. This is 
not the white cedar, or arbor vite, which is found in the 
Northern States and the mountains of North Carolina and 
Tennessee. The Coastal Plain white cedar forms dense 
swamps and is often found associated with the bald cypress 
in the South. In the Northern States the arbor vite forms 
almost impenetrable “cedar”? swamps. 
The bald cypress is a Southern tree, rarely found in 
other sections of our country unless carried there by man. 
When growing in swamps, its native home, it forms 
“knees.”’ These are growths from the roots and are believed 
to be devices to enable the roots to get air. The tree is 
called bald cypress because of the deciduous habit of its 
leaves, the tree being bare in winter.

Wood—Solt, light, heartwood brown, sapwood whitish. 
The Pines.—Undoubtedly the most important trees in 
our country, from the standpoint of production of lumber, 
are the pines. Most of the lumber used in the eastern half 
of the United States for homes, barns, and bridges is pine. 
White pine and Norway pine in the North, and the Southern 
pines in the South, and Western yellow pine in the West, 
are the trees most used to furnish this lumber. 
The Southern pines are the long leaf or Georgia pine, 
shortleaf pine, loblolly or old field pine, and the slash pine. 
Of these four species the long leaf pine is the most valuable 
and the one generally used. 
The long leaf pine grows mainly on the Coastal Plain 
from Virginia to Texas inclusive. The name comes from 
the long narrow leaves, called needles, which are from eight 
to twelve inches in length. The trunk of the tree is gener- 
ally straight and remarkably free from limbs. There is 
little taper to the trunks up to the lower limbs. Can you 
see any advantage in this to the lumberman in sawing it up 
into rough lumber? From a tree eighty to one hundred feet

high it is possible to get a sixty to an eighty-foot log with 
scarcely any knots. 
The long leaf pine for many years, really since shortly 
after Jamestown was settled, has also furnished the crude 
turpentine for spirits of turpentine, pitch, and rosin, and 
the tar that gave the people of North Carolina their nick- 
name, “Tar Heels.” (See Chapter X for the methods of 
making tar and turpentine.) It has furnished lumber and 
still is furnishing the largest logs in the South. 
FOR REFERENCE ONLY 
Long Leaf Pine (Pinus palustris). 
The long leaf pine is one of the most valuable timber trees 
of our country. It grows 
only in the States along the 
South Atlantic coast and 
Gulf of Mexico. 
It commonly grows to be 
two to three feet in diame-

* leaf pine area in the South is inland from that of the long 
leaf pine. 
The loblolly pine, or old field pine, grows in much the 
same region as the long leaf pine. It rarely grows in pure 
stands* as does the long leaf pine. The name “old field” 
pine comes from the fact that it is one of the first trees to 
spring up in abandoned fields. It is able to take possession 
of open spaces before other pines because its seeds spread 
more rapidly. Because its wood is coarse, brittle, and 
pitchy, it is not as valuable a tree for lumber as the long 
leaf pine. 
Compare this tree with the long leaf pine. The bark of 
the long leaf pine is light brown and has large, thin, irregu- 
lar scales. That of the loblolly pine is purplish brown, and 
has broad, flat, crooked ridges.

Another famous pine of our country is the Northern white 
pine, forests of which once extended from the Gulf of St. 
Lawrence westward to the prairies and grasslands of what 
is now the central United States. Its greatest range is in the 
North, but it is found in the higher parts of the mountain 
areas that extend southward from Pennsylvania and Mary- 
land. In what states is it, therefore, found in the South? In 
Virginia it may be found in the mountain valleys, but farther 
south, as in Georgia, it occurs only on the upper slopes of the 
mountains. The white pine grows best where the tempera- 
ture is cool and in dry, sandy, and gravelly soil and even 
on rocky ridges. It is, therefore, an indicator of poor soil. 
Its lumber, because of its many admirable qualities, has 
always been in great demand in America, and hence the 
white pine forests have long been the scene of active lumber- 
ing operations. The forests of New England furnished 
timber for the building of small vessels, even before the 
settlement of Plymouth. Long before the Revolutionary 
War the English navy secured masts from the white pine 
forests of Maine. For the last thirty or forty years white 
pine lumber has become so scarce that little is offered for 
sale, and then only at very high prices.

fogs and mists sweep in from the ocean, there are forests of 
redwood. The redwood trees are very large, but small when 
compared with the “Big Trees” of the Sierra Nevadas. 
The redwood is a conifer and is also a Sequoia. The 
largest of the trees are twenty to twenty-five feet in diame- 
ter and 250 to 300 feet high. Redwood groves near the cities 
of the Pacific coast are much frequented by tourists be- 
cause of their cooling shade and the majesty of the trees. 
The redwood tree is called the “tree everlasting.” When 
the tree is cut, numerous vigorous shoots come up from 
the stump.

Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens). 
The redwood is an exceedingly big tree, reac. ing heights 
from 200 to 340 feet, and ten to fifteen feet in diameter, 
but sometimes as much as _ 
twenty-five feet and with a * 
very narrow, irregular top in 
comparison with the size and 
height of the tree. The trunk 
of the tree is generally clear 
of branches for a height of 
seventy-five to one hundred 
feet. 
Bark—In ridges six to twelve 
inches thick on old trees. 
Leaves—One-fourth to one- 
| half inch long and one-fourth 
inch wide. Fic. 31. Redwood (natural size). 
Fruit—A cone three-fourths to 
an inch long and one-half inch through with seed one- 
sixteenth inch long. 
Wood—Solt, light, close-grained, not strong, durable and 
easily split, light red in color. Used for lumber, inside 
finish, shingles, and cross ties. 
  The Douglas fir, or spruce, is likewise a lare tree, but, in 
yeneral, smaller than the redwood. The larger trees grow to 
a height of 250 or more feet and have trunks ten to fifteen 
feet in diameter. This tree is found over many thousands of 
square miles in western Oregon and Washington. 
The Douglas fir is the most valuable of the Western trees 
in the production of lumber. The forests are being cut rap- 
idly, and it will not be many decades before the Douglas fir 
ill be as scarce as the white pine of the Northern States. 
Because of the great size of many of the trees they are lum-

bered with difficulty. It is sometimes necessary to split 
the logs to load them with the regular loading machinery. 
Some single trees make up a load for a logging train. 
FOR REFERENCE ONLY 
Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga taxifolia). 
The Douglas fir is an important timber tree of the moun- 
tains of the western United States. It grows to a height 
of 200 feet and a diameter of ten feet or more. It is 
most abundant and of largest size in Oregon and Wash- 
ington, but forms a very important part of the forests of 
the Sierras. 
Bark—Thin, dark gray, smooth, shiny on young trees, 
but on old trees it is rough, with ridges sometimes ten 
inches thick. 
Leaves—Three-fourths of an inch or more long, and nar- 
row, perhaps one-eighth inch. 
Fruit—A pendant cone usually two to four inches long, 
filled with small winged seed, lying between the cone 
seales. The seed, about one-fourth inch long and one- 
eighth inch wide, ripen by fall and are then scattered 
by the wind as they fall from the cones. 
Wood—Not heavy, medium hard, durable, reddish 
tinted; sapwood white. Known on the market as 
“Oregon pine.” 
The Western yellow, or bull pine, is found in all the 
states of the West, where there is sufficient moisture. It is 
not a large tree, the largest being about 200 feet tall. Like 
the other pines, it tends to form uniform stands, other trees 
being excluded, but it does grow also in stands with the 
sugar pine, white fir, Douglas fir, and Jeffrey pine. The 
stands are not close as with the white pine, Southern pine, 
and others of the eastern half of the United States. This 
is chiefly due to the small amount of rain. Most of the

Western Vellow Pine (Pinus ponderosa). 
The Western yellow pine is a very important timber tree 
of the West, ranging from Montana, Ne- 
braska, and Texas to the coast. It reaches 
a height of 225 feet and a diameter of 
seven or eight feet, but usually two to 
three and one-half feet. It has a narrow 
crown with short thick limbs frequently 
pendulous but turned up at the ends. In 
very dry sections it has a short, round 
crown.

Fruit—A reddish brown cone three to six inches long, 
with short prickles on the end of the scales. 
Wood—Rather hard and strong on lower portion of tree, 
fine-grained, with much sapwood. 
Sugar Pine (Pinus lambertiana). 
This tree is one of the white pines and grows to more than 
200 feet high and ten feet in diameter. It is also'a very 
beautiful tree when young, and stately when old, with a 
broad, short top, with branches tending to droop at the 
ends. It is found mostly in the Sierras and Coast ranges 
of California and Oregon. A sugar that sometimes exudes 
from the heartwood no doubt gave it the name, “sugar 
pine.” 
Bark—Light gray, thin and smooth, dark green on young 
trees, but becomes two to three inches thick on old 
trees, and breaks up into thick plates covered with 
thin reddish scales.

CHAPTER IV 
‘ENEMIES OF TREES 
Man’s Enemies.—There is nothing in nature more 
beautiful or more useful than a perfect tree. When we stop 
to consider for a moment, we wonder why we have never 
given this matter moré thoughtful attention. If people are 
sick or an accident has befallen them, their friends rush to 
their assistance and send for a doctor at once, if the diffi- 
culty is so severe they themselves cannot handle it. How 
carefully babies are tended! We cannot imagine keeping 
them in the dark, for we all know that sunshine and fresh 
air are necessary for health and strength. We try to feed 
them well, so they may become vigorous and grow rapidly. 
If a person acts with injustice toward his neighbor, we have 
our courts settle the trouble, protecting the rights of the 
oppressed. We even put into prison men who have acted in 
such a way as to be what we term “enemies of society.” 
One nation fights another to guard against invasion and to 
protect weaker nations, just as the United States did in 
the World War. In fact, we might assert, in the large, that 
people are on the outlook all the time to guard themselves 
and their young against enemies which they meet in life 
and which, for the sake of convenience, we might class as 
diseases, disasters, home enemies, and outside foes. 
Enemies of Trees.—Now let us consider the life of our 
trees. They, too, are subject to the attacks of all sorts of 
enemies, such as diseases, disasters, home enemies, and out- 
59
-P-A-G-E-70
60 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
side foes. Do we, as a rule, pay careful attention to the 
trees around our school, around our homes, in our town, or 
in the woods near our town? Are we studying them to see if 
some help is needed to keep them well and strong? Or are 
we treating with indifference one of the best friends man 
possesses in nature? Let us look about us to see if any of 
' our tree friends are suffering and need assistance which we 
can render. 
DISEASES 
Rot.—In the first place we shall discuss some of the dis- 
eases to which trees are especially subject. One of these 
is rot. We can readily detect this trouble by observing 
whether any part of the body of a tree or any of the limbs is 
dead or decayed. Many trees have hollow trunks, although 
they may look thrifty in every other way. This means that 
a disease which we call rot is destroying the wood on the 
inside, preventing the tree from maturing properly. This 
rot is caused by tiny life forms called fungi and bacteria; the 
latter we may liken to germs that cause diseases among 
people. In many cases, these fungi or bacteria have gained 
access to the tree through some scar or bruise. Where the 
tree is valuable the decayed portion can be cut out, painted, 
or in some instances filled with materials like cement just 
asa dentist removes the decayed portion of a tooth and 
then fills it with gold, porcelain, or cement. 
White-Pine Blister Rust.—Some types of fungi do not 
need access to the tree through a wound but attack the 
outer bark and then enter the inner bark, kill it, and so ruin 
the tree. Two of these kinds of fungi are the white-pine 
blister rust and the chestnut blight. The white-pine blister 
rust attacks the Eastern white pine, the Western white pine,

developing. 
and the sugar pine. It causes the bark to become swollen 
and dotted with yellowish-red blotches, and finally kills the 
tree. This disease has caused an enormous loss in pine trees 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  62 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
and in money spent trying to check its spread. The de- 
struction of all the currant and gooseberry bushes is the 
only known way of controlling it, because the pine blister 
rust spreads from the pine to the currant and gooseberry 
bushes and then to the pine again, and so on. 
The Chestnut Blight.—The chestnut blight also attacks 
live bark, and, as its name implies, is found only in the 
chestnut tree. It causes the infected portion to swell up and 
in time to die. As the tiny seed or spores come out from the 
diseased bark they spread to other chestnut trees, killing 
every one in their path. People who know say that in only a 
few years there will be no more chestnut trees in this coun- 
try. The pine blister rust and the chestnut blight were 
brought to the United States from abroad and they have 
caused tremendous money loss in our country. Special of- 
ficials should keep a close watch upon foreign trees and seed 
coming to us, so as to prevent the spread of such diseases. 
Leaf Blight.—There is another disease called leaf blight, 
also caused by fungi, which attacks many different kinds of 
leaves, such as maple, sycamore, and fir. In this case the 
leaves die, although the tree may survive. 
DISASTERS 
Snow and Ice.—-Disasters, like diseases, cause tremen- 
dous harm to trees. Among these we may mention snow 
and ice, fire, and violent storms. Snow and ice often accu- 
mulate upon trees in such quantities that they break off 
many limbs or even the trunks themselves. This, of course, 
is especially true in sections where the snowfall is extremely 
heavy or the climate subject to such low temperature that 
rain is frozen on the branches of the trees. In such cases 
little help can be given except to prop up overladen limbs.
-P-A-G-E-73
  ENEMIES OF TREES 63 
Forest Fires. -—Fires also do an incredible amount of dam- 
age. They kill outright many trees, both young and old. 
Others they partially burn, scorching portions of the bark. 
In Chapter II we have 
already seen that the 
growing part of the 
trunk and limbs is the 
cambium layer, which 
lies just beneath the 
bark and next to the 
sapwood. Now, if the 
fire kills portions of this 
inner bark, growth 
ceases at this point, in- 
sects and fungi get into 
the wood through the 
wounds made by the 
burns, and the trees be- 
come diseased. Thus, 
in any woods where 
fires have burned, there 
are sick trees. Some- pyc, 35. A Tree That Has Been Ruined by

eased places heal over ane was Ben tree before the eee 
on the outside, but nev- bulediai poston of the lite bac aR aROHE ee 
er on the inside. Decay 
continues and after a while the trees become hollow. Hun- 
ters are all familiar with hollow trees because their dogs 
“tree” squirrels, opossums, or other small animals which 
make their homes in them. Such trees are of no value for 
timber, and lumbermen leave them standing in the woods. 
Some trees become hollow from bruises made by falling     
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  
64 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US ' 
limbs or trees. But the number of hollow trees due to 
bruises are few compared to those caused by fires. 
In some States the worst time for fires is in the spring and 
fall of the year, particularly in those east of the Mississippi 
River. In other portions the summer months are worse, as 
in the mountainous States of the West. Heavy winds al- 
ways make fires in the woods hard to fight. They dry the 
leaves rapidly and, when the blaze gets started, the winds 
spread it and often great areas are burned off before the 
flames are checked. Thus many trees are badly scorched 
or even killed. 
Destruction of trees is not the only crime that must be 
charged against spring fires. As we know, birds build 
their nests in the woods. About the time the nests are full 
of little eggs or tiny young birds, along comes one of 
these woods fires. The bird eggs cannot roll out of the nests 
to escape, nor can the naked or downy little birds fly out of 
the way. The blaze reaches out and sets the nests on fire. 
The mothers, if not killed themselves, have lost their babies 
and their homes and must go elsewhere to live. 
Now let us see what happens in the fall. Frost comes and 
the leaves flit down to the ground. Strangely enough, on 
some clear day the air seems smoky, the sun looks red 
and angry. People say “Isn’t it hazy to-day?” This 
haze is due to the large amount of smoke in the air. We 
have just seen that the trees have thrown their leaves down 
to the ground around their feet. Lying there in the sun 
these leaves have become very dry. Some one carelessly 
or on purpose sets them on fire. The blaze spreads and 
spouts its great streams of smoke into the air. People 
round about say, “Oh, well, it is just the woods afire,” and 
they do not-pay any attention to it, since they fail to realize
-P-A-G-E-75
  ENEMIES OF TREES 65 
that it is hurting anything. So it burns and the skies grow 
dingy with smoke. At night the blaze stretches its red, 
angry body through the woods on the plains, the hills, or 
over the mountains, filling the air with haze. These fires 
all over the country make the cloudy appearance of the 
skies which is associated with “Indian Summer.” All this 
is called “beautiful.” When we once see in our mind’s eye 
the dead trees, the scarred hillsides, and the scorched birds, 
it never more seems beautiful to us. Many, in fact most, 
fires could be prevented if people were careful. 
Heavy Storms.—Sometimes we see great stretches of 
woodland where the trees: have been blown down. This is 
often observed in sections through which hurricanes and 
| tornadoes are accustomed to pass. It is a pitiable sight to 
find these massive and venerable trees torn up by the 
roots and lying on the ground. Even when winds are not 
strong enough wholly to wreck the trees, they often tear off 
many limbs, break out the leading stems of the tops, and 
mutilate the trees so that they remain unshapely and sub- 
ject to disease. Such accidents to trees are often difficult 
to prevent, just as great catastrophes are difficult to control 
among human beings. 
HOME ENEMIES 
There are certain plants, insects, and birds that we may 
consider as home enemies of tree life. They may be called 
home enemies because they are naturally closely associated 
with trees; in fact, they always live in or among trees. 
Trees.—Perhaps the enemy that comes first to mind is 
the tree itself. Sometimes one tree is an enemy of another 
because it stands too close to or over that tree. Then it 
shades the first one and cuts off the sunlight, hindering it  
-P-A-G-E-76
  66 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
from growing properly. The enemy tree also is sending its 
roots down into the same soil and drawing from the soil water 
and food which the first tree needs. This process causes 
much trouble to the first tree, stunting its development and 
sometimes killing it. Often it is necessary to remove com- 
pletely the enemy tree in order to protect its neighbor. 
Vines.—Many wild grapevines grow in the woods. Some 
are called winter grapes, because they ripen in the early 
winter. Many clusters of grapes may be found on these 
vines even after Christmas. Others are called summer 
grapes, because their fruit ripens in the summer. Some 
boys and girls like wild grapes even though they be quite 
sour. Young people love to climb the trees on which these 
vines run and to make grapevine swings. Now, it may 
seem strange that these vines harm trees. They grow 
as the trees grow; they climb out onto the tender young 
ends of limbs, weigh them down, and keep them bent. 
When the vine climbs up the main top limb of a tree in the 
springtime, the tender new end of its branch is pulled over 
by the weight of the burden. This top limb is the main 
body of the tree, and so the trunk of the tree becomes 
crooked and sometimes badly deformed. Trees of this sort 
can be found wherever vines grow on them. Other kinds 
of vines wrap themselves closely around young trees and 
limbs, choke them, stunt them, and sometimes kill them. 
These vines harbor insects and thus often give them a 
chance to attack the tree. The vines take from the soil 
food and moisture which the tree needs. Poison ivy, called 
poison oak or three-leafed ivy, harms trees in a similar way. 
Virginia creeper, or five-leafed ivy, is a very pretty vine, 
and many people in cities and towns like to have it on 
their shade trees, but it never helps any tree and usually

Fic. 36. Mistletoe on an Elm. 
What does the text say as to the effects of mistletoe on a tree? 
causes harm in the same way that the poison ivy and the 
wild grapevine do. 
Mistletoe.—At Christmas people enjoy decorating with 
mistletoe. Its green stubby branches and leaves and its 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  68 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
whitish waxlike berries are very pretty. Now, mistletoe 
grows on branches of trees, often on trees along the road- 
side. It can be seen best in winter when the leaves are off, 
unless it happens to be on pines or other evergreens. It is 
found in bunches and is not part of the trees, but has its own 
roots, which grow into the wood of the limbs from which they 
get sap. Such plants as mistletoe are called parasites, be- 
cause they live off other growths. If there are enough 
such parasites on a tree, they will kill it. To pull off these 
growths is the only remedy. 
INSECTS 
Caterpillars.—Among these home enemies are caterpillars, 
scales, and beetles. Caterpillars come from tiny eggs laid on 
the leaves by moths (a variety of insect) which resemble 
butterflies. The little caterpillars hatch from these eggs 
just as chicks come out of hens’ eggs. Immediately they 
begin to eat the leaves around them for food. There may 
be so many that they can remove all the leaves from a big 
tree. We have learned before that leaves help trees to 
breathe. When leaves are injured or destroyed, the tree is 
hurt. Sometimes caterpillars can eat the leaves from a tree 
once or twice without killing it, but, if this happens a num- 
ber of times in succession, the poor tree dies. 
Scales.—Scales are also enemies of trees. They are little 
insects with shells or crusts over their backs. They lie close 
to the tenderer outside bark of limbs and young trees and 
suck the sap, or “blood,” of the tree. They too may cause 
the tree to die if there are enough of them. 
Beetles.—Beetles, commonly known as “bugs,” lay their 
eggs under the bark of trees. The eggs are sometimes so 
tiny they can scarcely be seen. Soon the warm sunshine
-P-A-G-E-79
    ENEMIES OF TREES 69 
causes them to hatch into grubs, and these begin to eat the 
tender inner bark of the tree which lies next to the wood. 
When they feed on this, the sap is prevented from flowing, 
for, as we have learned already, sap flows up the tree in the 
sapwood and down the tree in the tender live bark. Often 
these little grubs eat and destroy so much of the inside 
bark that no sap can flow and the tree dies. Spraying of 
trees helps to kill the caterpillars. This is. practicable 
when the trees are around our homes, near our school, or in 
our town. Beetles can only be killed by cutting them out 
of the trees and sometimes this is very difficult to accomplish. 
Some Birds.—Some birds, as the yellow-bellied wood- 
pecker, are enemies of trees, because they puncture them 
| with their bills to suck the sap and to obtain the cambium 
layer, or inner bark. This is harmful, since often the trunks 
are girdled with so many holes that disease follows or insects 
may gain entrance to the trees at these places and begin to 
‘feed on the wood. It becomes necessary sometimes to kill 
such pests, but care should be taken to distinguish these 
enemies from other woodpeckers which are friends to trees. 
OUTSIDE FOES 
Some Men.—Man does not live on or in trees, as birds, 
insects, and vines do, so we have named him an outside foe 
—that is, he is a foe when he acts in an unfriendly way 
toward them. Many of the deeds of man which are harmful 
to trees are not intentionally so. He is usually simply care- 
less or thoughtless. For instance, he often sets fire to grass 
and leaves where trees are standing. This, as we have seen, 
is injurious to trees and does not help grazing, as many 
people suppose, because the tenderer grasses are eventually 
ruined and the tougher, less nutritious species are left. So 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  jo OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
long as he continues this practice he will prevent young 
trees from developing, and make the soil poor by keeping 
the rich vegetation burned off. 
, Man has also ruthlessly cut down trees, as so often is the 
case in lumbering operations. Years ago forests were plenti- 
ful and no one thought of their becoming scarce, so it hap- 
pened that when timber was taken out no attention was 
paid to protecting the young trees that were left. Massive 
oaks, poplars, and chestnuts, pines and hemlocks were 
felled, and permitted to crash unhindered into groups of 
young, thrifty trees, often destroying every one. Even to- 
day this is going on. Farmers also have needlessly cut 
timber by clearing new ground for which they had really 
no use. Many a splendid specimen of tree has been 
brought down merely for the sake of a coon or oppossum 
that some hunter’s dog has found. 
Man also injures trees by chopping them carelessly. 
Sometimes he sticks his axe into the bark or knocks off 
pieces or bruises it with his hammer. Often he drives nails 
into trees. We can call to mind any number of thought- 
less acts performed by man against these, his friends. 
Horses, Cattle, Hogs.—Horses, cattle, hogs, and other 
stock must sometimes be classed as outside foes of trees. 
They munch the tender young sprouts in the pasture, thus 
causing young trees to grow poorly or to die. Horses often 
gnaw the bark, while all stock trample and pack the 
ground on top of the roots, thus depriving the tree of proper 
moisture for growth. When we learn to appreciate the 
value of a tree and its needs, then most of these evils com- 
ing from outside foes will cease, since their remedy lies in 
forethought and understanding.
-P-A-G-E-81
  
  CHAPTER V 
FRIENDS OF TREES 
Most of the Birds.—In the last chapter we discussed 
some birds that are enemies of trees. Now we want to 
learn something about the birds that are friends of trees. 
There are many more birds that are friends of trees than 
enemies. Let us mention some of the ways in which birds 
are of benefit to trees. Birds live upon many bugs and in- 
sects which are enemies of trees, and some birds eat cater- 
| pillars. Most of the woodpeckers are great friends of trees, 
because they are constantly looking for the bark beetles. 
One may see the little woodpecker as he climbs the tree 
turn his head to one side as if he were listening. He surely 
is listening, trying to hear the bark beetle, or grub, munch- 
ing away on the inner bark and possibly on the cambium 
layer inside. These little beetles and grubs make a very 
distinct sound while eating, and it is easy for the wood- 
pecker to hear them. As soon as the bird hears the cutting 
noise in the bark, he pecks a hole to get the “bug.” One 
might think this bird would hurt trees by pecking holes in 
the bark, but he is really helping to protect other trees by 
killing and eating beetles whose eggs would hatch into 
hundreds of other beetles which would kill still more trees. 
The holes that these birds make are like the cut a doctor 
might have to make on the hand to get a sliver out. We 
do not like the cut, but the sliver is more harmful than 
the cut. Sometimes pine trees die because of the bark 
71
-P-A-G-E-82
  72 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
beetles. Fhen woodpeckers will peck away a great deal of 
the outside bark in order to catch the beetles before they 
escape to other trees. In this way the birds, while they do 
not keep the pine tree from dying, nevertheless kill the bugs 
that would attack other trees. 
In. the woods certain little birds may be seen jumping 
from twig to twig in the trees looking under the leaves for 
worms or insects to eat. These worms or insects arc usually 
the kind that live on trees and are tree enemies. 
Many boys and girls know the nuthatch, the titmouse, 
the vireo, the bluebird, the robin redbreast, the warbler, 
the wren, the waxwing, the chickadee, and the oriole; all 
these are tree friends because they eat so many kinds of in- 
sects that are tree enemies. These boys and girls know 
also the tent-caterpillar, the web-worm, the elm-leaf beetle, 
the gypsy-moth, the brown-tail moth, and scales, all of 
which are tree enemies. If the little birds just mentioned 
were plentiful enough, there would not be nearly so much 
harm to trees from these insects, because they would be 
eaten by the birds. The little .22-celiber rifle and shotgun, 
however, often destroy even these little birds, the friends 
of trees. While the little feathered friend is hunting 
eagerly or looking patiently for a bug or worm to eat, 
somebody shoots it just to see how well he can shoot or 
to see the “feathers fly.” 
Some People.—In the chapter just studied we sav how 
people may be enemies of trees. Let us now see how they 
may be friends of trees. Many love trees and help in every 
way to protect them. People in cities and towns set out 
shade trees and spray them to kill the harmful insects. 
Many farmers take good care of their woods and keep 
fires from burning through them. The tiny baby trees can
-P-A-G-E-83
  FRIENDS OF TREES 73 
easily be destroyed by cows, horses, sheep, and hogs, so 
the thoughtful farmer does not let his stock graze on his 
young trees. Farmers often plant tree seed and young 
trees on their land, so helping trees to grow. 
Many men and women study the kinds of insects that 
are tree enemies and the ways to kill these insects. They 
write books, telling people how to get rid of such insects. 
These men and women are friends of trees because they 
work to destroy the tree enemies. 
School-children sometimes wish to have shade around 
heir school-buildings instead of bare grounds, so they set 
Ba trees and care for them. They are friends of trees. 
Winds.—It is surprising to hear any one say that wind 
can be a friend of trees, but let us see if this is not often 
true. Of course a wind might be so strong as to blow a 
ree down or break off its limbs. We are not talking about 
t wind as heavy as that. 
A tree holds with its roots because it does not have hands, 
as we have, with which to grasp. It cannot run away. If 
something strong pushes against it, the tree must remain 
where it is and hold tight to the ground with its roots, and 
ts trunk must be strong so as not to break. Winds blowing 
heavily upon trees help them to grow strong, because the 
more the wind blows the harder the trees hold by their 
oots. This exercises the trees and makes them strong, 
ust as exercise makes boys and girls strong. If young 
eople sit down all the time,. they become weak. The 
rees pull and strain to withstand winds and this strength- 
ns them. It is like the game “tug of war,” where boys 
nd girls choose sides and then hold to each other and > 
ull, one side against the other. The children must hold 
ight if they do not want to be thrown down, and so must

trees: Old shipmasters who went to sea in sailing-vessels 
used masts for their ships which came from trees grown in 
wind-swept sections, because they knew such trees were 
strong. Trees standing together in groups protect each 
other against hard winds, so when many of them are re- 
moved the remaining few, not having been strengthened 
by constant struggle, are pushed down.

CHAPTER VI 
FORESTS AND SOME OF THEIR 
NON-COMMERCIAL USES 
Definition and Description of a Forest.—We have been 
studying about trees by themselves, that is, individual trees. 
‘Now we are going to study about trees growing as a com- 
munity. Where trees stand close together in groups (that 
is, the way people live in a town) they depend upon each 
other and struggle with each other. We call such a com- 
munity a forest. The young growth, forest floor, and earth 
laround the roots of these trees compose part of the forest. 
We usually think of these communities of trees as cover- 
ing big spaces. The word forest makes us think of trees 
land trees and trees extending so far that we cannot see 
through them. We think of the light being dimmer in such 
woods because of the shadows made by the tree trunks and 
heir leafy tops. We think of great numbers of little trees 
and bushes growing underneath the big trees. We seem to 
x the crackling of the leaves as we walk through them, 
the murmur of a distant stream, and the snap of brittle 
twigs which break as we step upon them. We almost feel 
the cool, fresh air that we associate with the shade of many 
trees on warm summer days. There are many kinds of 
forests in our country. In the mountains in the western part 
pf the United States the trees grow to a tremendous height 
‘+-some as high as 300 feet. (See Chapter III.) Estimate 
just how high that is. Some of these forests are made up 
75 
   
-P-A-G-E-86
  
76 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
wholly of evergreen trees. They are very magnificent and 
impressive to people who visit them from other parts of 
the country, because of the immensity of the trees. 
Many of the forests around the northern, eastern, and 
southern borders of the United Statés are also made up 
largely of evergreen trees. In the central parts of the 
United States, however, the forests are composed largely 
of what are known as hardwoods which shed_ their leaves 
every fall and so are not green in winter time, but look 
naked and bare. (See Chapter III.) 
What boy or girl has not read about Sherwood Forest, 
where, in a great cave, Robin Hood lived with his large 
company of men? They stayed out in the open air most of 
the time, and wanted no house for a home, but preferred 
the high, dense trees with their cool shadows, their still, 
quiet, and wild surroundings. 
This remarkable forest was a great place for game and 
other wild life. Deer in herds lived there; birds kept the 
trees ringing with their songs. Robin Hood and his men 
were notable marksmen, and were the masters of the big 
forest. They had no guns, but they had bows and arrows, 
and were skilful hunters. They wore coats of green to 
match the green leaves of the forest. 
That wonderful forest was in England. The land on 
which it stood was hilly, and perhaps the cave in which 
Robin Hood and his men lived is still there. But now al- 
most no forest is left: The ground has been largely cleared 
of trees, and cultivated, even though much of it is very 
sandy and poor. Wealthy men have built their mansions 
where the most beautiful parts used to be, and some of 
the remaining woodlands have been made into parks. No 
one would know it now as the place where the great trees
-P-A-G-E-87
    
FORESTS AND THEIR NON-COMMERCIAL USES Ti 
stood close together for many miles, making what was 
once the great Sherwood Forest, within which Robin Hood 
and his merry band of green clad companions lived their 
happy, free lives, their own masters under their own laws. 
Homes of Birds.—One of the first sounds that we hear 
upon entering a forest is the note or song of some bird. 
Can you imagine the loneliness of a forest without a bird? 
The low, bushy-topped little trees are the favorite homes 
of certain kinds of birds; others live high up in the tallest 
trees they can find. Some like to build their nests on the 
ground, while still others build in hollow limbs. These 
forests are the homes of many of our little feathered friends. 
Birds love to live in woods, because there they find much of 
their food among the insects that live in the trees and on 
the leaves, and there they find places for nests and protec- 
tion for their young. Many prefer to live there rather than 
out in the open among the scattered trees, and so we may 
call the forest the home of birds. This, then, is one of the 
natural and important uses of the forest. 
Homes of Game.—Forests are often called game pre- 
serves because they offer protection to wild animals. They 
are the homes of these wild animals just as they are the 
homes of birds. Game love the woods, and most of them 
die if removed. It is very interesting to people to have 
these wild creatures to study, and it is right that most of 
them should be allowed to live. : 
There are, however, many different kinds of animals in’ 
the forests of the United States. Some do so much harm 
that they must be killed; others are allowed to live. There 
are many familiar animals, such as squirrels, chipmunks, 
ground hogs, opossums, and rabbits living in forests. Among 
the less common and larger animals are the coyotes, rac-
-P-A-G-E-88

coons, beavers, wolves, bears, wildcats, elk, deer, and 
mountain lions. Wolves and mountain lions are so danger- 
ous that it is best to have them killed. Wolves are danger- 
ous not only to man but to harmless sheep and cattle tha

  may be grazing near the forest. Mountain lions also at- 
tack men and sheep, as well as wild game, so people try to 
rid the forests of them. Therefore, there are laws which per- 
mit men to hunt these animals. Many furnish food, while 
others provide fur which is used for clothing. 
Sources of Recreation.—Boys and girls enjoy picnicking 
and camping in the woods. Many people travel to great 
distances where there are especially wonderful forests.
-P-A-G-E-89
    FORESTS AND THEIR NON-COMMERCIAL USES 79 
Some of these are up in the mountains where one can look 
off in the distance to snow-capped peaks. Some have beau- 
tiful lakes and rivers. Rare wild flowers and shrubs grow in 
many of them. 
So again we can point out another use of the forests. 
They provide places for recreation. 
Regulators of Climate.—Forests make the country imme- 
diately surrounding them cooler in summer and warmer in 
winter. Let us see how they do this. In winter time the 
cold blasts of wind do not blow with full force through the 
woodlands, since the many trees prevent them from having 
a clear sweep.. Thus the country on the side protected by 
the forest does not suffer from the cold ‘winds of winter 
as it would if the forests were not there. In summer the air 
in the woods is cooler than that over the open fields, where 
the sunshine bakes the ground. This cool air flows out from 
the forests, mingles with the surrounding air, and cools 
it. In some’ states, as in Kansas and Nebraska, clumps _ 
and belts of trees have been planted by landowners to 
act in this manner on their farms—particularly to break 
the force of winds which otherwise might harm their crops. 
These woodlands also often prevent, in early spring and fall, 
the temperature from falling so low as to bring frost to these 
crops. Another use, then, of the forests is to prevent too 
much cold and too much heat. 
Preservers of Stream Flow.—Streams of clear water are 
usually good to look upon. We hardly ever stop to think 
where they started or why they are clear. Sometimes we 
wonder where all the water can come from and why it keeps 
on flowing. A stream that has clear water, that runs stead- 
ily all the year round, comes from springs that are pro- 
tected by forested land. Trees take care of our streams, 
and they do this in a most interesting manner. Every
-P-A-G-E-90
  80 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
year the trees of the forests drop leaves or needles upon the 
ground forming a thick, soft covering on the earth, called 
leaf litter. This carpet acts like a sponge and quickly 
absorbs great quantities of water when the rain falls.

Fic. 38. Bare Slopes and Flooded Lowlands. 
The water from rain runs down bare slopes rapidly. On lowlands it piles up and makes floods. Forest on the slopes would have checked the movement of the water. During floods roads, bridges, and houses may be destroyed. Crops are drowned or covered with sand and 
gravel. Farm’animals and even people are sometimes drowned. 
    Most of this water soaks down into the soft earth beneath, 
and then runs out clear and cool from the ground as springs. 
These springs form sparkling streams which do not go dry in 
the summer time. If the trees were not present to spread 
this thick carpet on the ground, little of the rain water 
would have time to soak into the earth. It would run off
-P-A-G-E-91
  FORESTS AND THEIR NON-COMMERCIAL USES 81 
over the bare ground,. and, as it ran down the slopes, it 
would carry dirt with it into the streams below. The high 
waters would wash away bridges, fences, and sometimes 
houses, horses, sheep, cattle, and even people. Occasionally 
such high waters wash away valuable parts of farm lands 
or cover up rich bottom fields with stones and gravel that 
make the land useless. 
Often people living in cities and towns get their drinking 
water from lakes and streams surrounded by woods. Thus 
we see that another great use of our forests is to help the 
water supply by keeping it clear and running evenly the 
year round. 
Providers of Beauty.—How dreary life would be with- 
out blue skies, trees, mountains, music, pictures, and 
countless other forms of loveliness which may be enjoyed. 
We become so accustomed to them that we fail to realize 
their value. Forests provide much of the beauty in nature 
known to man. : 
In many, rare plants and shrubs grow, unusual creatures 
live, and people travelling through them see. changing 
views of unsurpassed scenery. 
“Many of the paintings of great masters are pictures of 
forests. Can you name any artists who painted scenes in 
woods? You probably know that musicians compose music 
to describe streams in the forests, birds among the trees, 
and winds sighing through rustling leaves. There are a 
number of poems in this book written about the woods. 
It is surprising when you stop to think how much that is 
beautiful comes either directly or indirectly from this 
source and so it is important to remember that forests 
furnish beauty.
-P-A-G-E-92
CHAPTER VII 
NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FORESTS 
NATURAL FORESTS 
We may divide forests into two kinds: natural and arti- 
ficial. A natural forest is the woodland that grows up of 
itself as nature planted it, as wild flowers grow; that is, it 
comes from seeds sown by nature without the help of peo- 
ple, or from sprouts and suckers which grew up from old 
stumps and roots in the forest. How do seeds get planted 
without people’s help? There are a number of ways, some 
of which we shall now study. 
Seeds Scattered by Wind.—Many trees have small, light 
seeds, with thin, flat strips called wings on their sides or 
ends. These seeds cannot flap their wings and fly like but- 
terflies, they must depend on the wind to carry them; and 
when the wind blows it flits them through the air, some- 
times many miles away from the tree which bore them. 
‘When these seeds alight in suitable places, such as bare 
ground, loose and moist, they come up in due time and 
grow into trees if they are given a chance. Some of the 
trees that bear seeds of this kind are the maple, pine, 
spruce, fir, poplar, elm, and ash. 
The maple seed has two wings. (See Fig. 17.) The 
pine, spruce, and fir seeds have only one wing each, and 
they grow in cones with many others for company, like 
brothers and sisters in a family. When cold weather comes 
in the fall of the year, the cones open, drop their seeds out, 
82
-P-A-G-E-93

and the wind scatters them just as we have described. 
The poplar seeds grow attached to a spike in the centre, 
forming a cluster, conelike in shape. These are also scat- 
tered by the wind in the fall as they ripen. Elm seeds grow

in bunches and are of two kinds: those that ripen in the 
fall, and those that ripen in the spring. (See Fig. 24.) 
Ash seeds form themselves in an open cluster. 
Some trees have tiny seeds without wings, but covered 
with a light, fluffy, white, downy material, which makes 
them float along easily in the air when the wind blows. 
These can be seen in springtime drifting by like tiny bits of
-P-A-G-E-94
84 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
cotton, and few people know that there are willow seeds 
wrapped up carefully in these little floating, fuzzy objects. 
Such delicate seeds light on both land and water. When 
they drop on land they rarely come up unless the ground is 
wet and stays wet. When, on the other hand, these seeds 
light on a pond or stream, they drift along until they reach 
the shore or bank, and then, at the proper time, begin to 
grow in the wet soil and to develop into trees. This is the 
reason that the banks of ponds and streams along the 
roadside are so generally covered with willow trees. The 
sycamore also has seeds that are scattered like the willow, 
but these are much bigger and heavier than either the 
willow or cottonwood. 
Seeds Scattered by Birds.—Birds also scatter many tree 
seeds. The hackberry, cherry, red cedar, dogwood, black 
gum, and other such species bear their seeds in the form 
of a fruit, that is, covered with a sweet, juicy pulp that 
birds like and eat. Thus birds light on these trees to feed 
upon the fruit, and drop the seeds along fence rows or 
in the woods and open fields. This is why so many hack- 
berries and cedar trees are found growing along fence rows. 
Such seeds as these are too heavy to be blown by the 
wind, and so they must be carried in some other way. 
Seeds Scattered by Small Animals.—Many other trees 
also have seeds too heavy to be blown by the wind. Some 
of these are the oak, hickory, walnut, and chestnut trees. 
Gray squirrels, ground squirrels, and chipmunks like some 
tree seeds such as acorns, hickory nuts, walnuts, and chest- 
nuts. The little animals do not eat all the nuts they 
find, but hide some in the ground in different places, and 
often go away and forget them. This gives the forgot- 
ten tree seeds a chance to come up and grow if other
-P-A-G-E-95
  NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FORESTS 85 
little animals do not discover them. It is a wonderful pro- 
vision of nature that these small creatures of the forest 
help to plant tree seeds. They are not aware of what they 
are accomplishing, and they do not intend to forget where 
they have hidden the nuts, but they do both of these things, 
and so many of our finest forest trees owe their very lives 
to the squirrels and the chipmunks. 
Seeds Scattered by Streams.—It is interesting to ex- 
_ periment with the different kinds of tree seeds to see if they 
will float in water. Some that float are maple, cottonwood, 
willow, acorn, hackberry, elm, beechnut, poplar, and ash. 
Black locust seeds, redbud, and persimmon cannot float at 
all in water. Walnut, hickory, and acorn seeds will not 
when they are well soaked with water, but can float 
or some distance before they are entirely wet. Numer- 
us streams carry along with their currents many kinds of 
seeds that will float just like little boats carrying precious 
loads. These little seed boats land on the banks of the 
treams, and in their proper season start to grow and be- 
ome big trees. These same streams spread out over their 
banks sometimes, and the floating seeds drift over bot- 
tom land and if the land is not cultivated or grazed cause 
great thickets of many sorts of trees to develop. 
Seeds Scattered by Falling.—As we have seen, tree seeds 
in a natural forest are scattered by the wind, birds, animals, 
| and streams. However, the wind does not blow all the 
time, nor do birds, animals, and streams scatter all the 
seeds from the trees. Countless numbers of them fall to 
the ground right under the parent tree, and many of these 
may never have a chance to sprout and grow, because they 
are shaded by so many big trees. Those which cannot 
grow in the dense shade of other trees are called “‘intoler- 
   
-P-A-G-E-96
  86 JR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
  ant.” They must have open light all the time in order to 
live. * Black locusts, yellow poplar, hickory, linden, black 
cherry, red cedar, and pitch pine are among them. How- 
ever, there are numerous species of trees that can grow in 
shade. Some of these are hemlock, sugar maple, dogwood, 
red fir, white fir, white pine, and beech. They are called 
“tolerant” trees, because they are able to endure much 
shade. Now when seeds of “tolerant” trees fall to the 
ground they frequently come up and form dense thickets of 
seedlings, which may grow very slowly for a number of years 
because of a lack of sunshine. These trees grow best in 
sunlight, but will live in spite of the shade. As soon as the 
parent trees and others towering over them are removed, 
they will begin developing rapidly, because they receive 
more sunlight, 
Struggle for Existence.—What a struggle baby trees, 
growing in close stands, have to keep alive. They fight 
against each other to get food, light, and water, and they 
must have all of these to grow. The roots of these little 
trees push right into the same soil. They spread out, making 
great masses of roots, crossed and interwoven, all seeking 
food from the same earth. If some of these trees cannot get 
enough food from the soil and light from the air above, 
they soon are choked out and die. Their fight for life 
is quiet and noiseless. People do not usually realize that 
this is going on in the forests, for there is no commotion, 
but if they would stop to look at a thicket of young trees 
to see how many are dead, or almost dead, they would 
then realize how desperate is the struggle among trecs. 
Some do not grow fast enough, and so are smothered to 
death under the tops of their more rapidly developing 
neighbors. As long as a tree can keep its top on a level
-P-A-G-E-97
  
  
| 
    
  NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FORESTS 87 
with the rest of the trees, it will probably live, and is called 
a “dominant’’ tree; but, if it loses in the race, and its top 
gets underneath the others, it is then a “‘suppressed”’ tree, 
and may not live. The lower limbs of the trees that are 
crowded close together die. We have seen that sunlight is 
necessary for the food which the leaves make for the trees. 
(See Fig. 4.) Since the leaves on the limbs far down on the 
trees do not get as much sunshine as they need, these limbs 
die and fall off. This causes the young trees to have straight, 
long stems without limbs, except near the top, where they 
get plenty of light. After a while, probably after a good 
many years, these long, slim, straight bodied trees will be 
ready for use. Such trees are much better for lumber than 
those with many branches. So while the struggle for ex- 
istence destroys branches of the trees, it makes good timber. 
Weeding.—We can greatly help nature in producing 
good timber by doing what we call “weeding.” We know 
what it means to “weed” a garden; another name for 
“weeding” is thinning. We cut down or pull up the weeds 
and other plants we do not want, and which are harmful 
to those we wish to grow. So, in a forest, some trees should 
be cut down and removed for the benefit of the others. 
Just as we have already seen, many trees in both natural 
_ and artificial forests become stunted on account of the 
struggle they must make to live.. Many of these same 
stunted trees will grow large enough to make good stove- 
wood or firewood before they cause harm to other trees 
around them, or before they themselves die. Some be- 
come crooked and diseased. Others are of the poorer species 
and are not valuable for lumber. If such trees as these can 
be removed or weeded out and used, they will supply fuel 
and leave more space for the remaining trees. Often some
-P-A-G-E-98
  ' 
88 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
of the larger trees that are weeded out can be used for 
posts, poles, crossties, and lumber. 
Many boys and girls, particularly those on the farm, 
know stunted, crooked, and diseased trees, and some of 
the poorer species, as the red maple, elm, sassafras, hack- 
berry, sourwood, black-jack oak, and the like. Most boys 
on the farm have spare time that they can use in a very 
helpful way by going into their fathers’ woodlands and 
cutting out these poorer, stunted, or diseased trees for 
stove and firewood in their homes. Many schools are 
heated by wood; others by coal. Close to these same 
schools may be woodlands, which should be thinned or 
weeded as described above, and provide wood to heat the 
schoolrooms. It would be a great help and a saving to 
many homes also if they would use this wood for heating 
purposes instead of buying coal. 
Co-operation in the Forest.—Although the trees in a 
forest struggle against each other to get food, light, and 
water, when they are attacked by their common enemies, 
storms and heavy winds, they help each other. By stand- 
ing close together they prevent the wind from blowing 
freely through them, just as when people, caught in a 
storm, stand close together to keep warm and prevent the 
winds from striking so directly. Thus through the protec- 
tion provided by their companions many trees are kept 
from being severely broken or knocked down by storms 
and winds. 
ARTIFICIAL FORESTS 
We have seen that a natural forest is one planted by 
winds, birds, streams, and small animals. An artificial 
forest is one planted and taken care of by man. It is in-

teresting to know that there are many great forests exist- 
ing to-day which were planted by people many, many 
years ago. How won- 
derful it was for men’, 
living in times gone by 
to plant these trees for 
their children and their 
children’s children! 
There are to-day hun- 
dreds of thousands of 
acres of such forests in 
Europe, especially in 
Germany, France, and 
Italy. People learned 
away back centuries ago 
that their countries 
could not live and de- 
velop unless they had 
plenty of forests. We 
can hardly imagine how 
much work it must 
have been to set out all 
these trees.

eries and reset them where the forests were desired. These 
tree-planters of years gone by knew that they could never 
live to see those baby trees grow large enough to use, but 
they realized that their descendants would need them, and 
so Europe to-day possesses wonderful artificial forests. As 
these forests are cut away, they are replanted with young 
trees. 
Appearance and Development.—The appearance of 
these artificial forests is very similar to that of natural 
forests, but they are in great measure helped to live by 
man. In this country also we have many artificial forests. 
Most of these are less than fifty years old. Some are to be 
found in the older settled states, as Massachusetts, Con- 
necticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina, 
which many years ago cut off most of their natural for- 
ests. Many are also found in states like Nebraska and 
Kansas, which had only scattered forests when settled.

NATIONAL AND STATE FORESTRY 
NATIONAL FORESTRY 
Creation of National Forests——We now see how won- 
| derful our forests are and how important they are in our 
daily lives. Great men before us have realized this very 
fact, and so it:has come about that the United States 
Government owns and takes charge of 157,500,000 acres 
of forests for the benefit of us all. This vast area is not in 
one body, but is in blocks of various shapes and sizes. 
Nearly all of our national forests are in the West. Many 
people wonder why this is so. Years ago white people in 
our country dwelt only in the eastern part of the United 
States. The Middle West and the West were great areas 
of wild lands, much of them forested, where no one but 
Indians lived. How brave were the white people who 
first travelled over them seeking new homes! These lands 
belonged to the Government and were called the Public 
Domain. As people built houses and made their homes on 
these lands, the Government gave to them small tracts, in 
general not more than 640 acres each. Certain sections,’ 
however, the Government has always kept. From these 
ands in the West our national forests have been chosen 
and set aside for this purpose by the President of the United 
States. In the East the government has had to buy, and 
still is buying, lands from private owners for national for- 
ests because there is no Public Domain from which to se- 
ect them.

West the fires are very gorgeous and often terrifying to 
look at. The trees have resin in the bark and needles, and

resin burns readily. So when the dead needles on the 
ground catch fire, it spreads very rapidly if the wind is 
blowing. Often when the trees are near together and the 
limbs of the young trees come close to the ground, the 
blaze from the ground sets fire to the needles on the limbs 
and rushes up through the branches, spreading from tree 
to tree, until the tops are lashed with roaring flames. 
These leap many feet into the air above the highest trees

and cause the fire to spread by shooting sparks into other 
parts of the forest. These “top fires” are very difficult to 
control, but fires which burn on the ground can be readily 
handled if the men get to them in time. 
Locating Fires.—Placed on high points in the forests 
are towers called lookout stations. Here lookouts stay

during the daytime in the fire season and keep a con- 
stant watch for fires. By using field glasses they are able 
to see for ong distances. As soon as they observe a column 
of smoke rising up anywhere from the forest, they at once 
telephone to the office of the supervisor and also to the 
rangers and fireguards, who immediately rush men to the 
fire by the quickest means possible. 
In some sections airplanes also are used to locate forest

sent to headquarters.

course, we plunge into the unbroken forest unmindful of the 
heavy underbrush, logs, and steep slopes before us. An hour 
later our shovels and rakes are busy on the line. Two forest 
guards with a good sized crew of men have already reached 
the fire and are raking a clear dirt path in front of the blaze. 
Axes are sounding here and there along the line, felling

the dead snags that have caught fire and which will scat- 
ter sparks farther into the forest if they are left standing. 
One man is kept busy setting fire along the clear raked fire 
line so as to burn back and meet the blaze that is coming 
on. This is called back-firing. Hot, perspiring, half chok- 
ing, these men squint through eyelids smarting with smoke. 
Fearing lest the rising wind sweep the already angry blaze 
into a dense stand of young pines and firs, these grim fight-
-P-A-G-E-109
NATIONAL AND STATE FORESTRY 99 
ers redouble their efforts, and just in the nick of time push 
their fire.line between those trees and the onrushing fury. 
Gradually they lengthen the path till it completely sur- 
rounds the burning tract. 
It is now dark; the back-fires have all pushed into the 
‘surrounded area and have met the other flames. Now there 
are only dead logs burning inside the encircled section. 
The wind has died with the day, but the men keep on their 
job. They sit down in the light of the camp fire to eat, to 
smoke, but most of all to watch the woods ceaselessly. 
Many fearsome tales of bygone fires are related. Finally 
a last trip of inspection is made and all is reported safe for 
the night. The soft forest floor of pine needles furnishes 
the beds, and as the last man knocks the ashes from his 
pipe, he remarks: “This fire started from that ol’ dead pine 
I cut down when we first reached here this evenin’. Light- 
nin’ struck it durin’ that storm day before yesterday maw- 
nin’ arid set afire one of its roots, which has been smolderin’ 
ever since.” 
Causes of Fire.—Forest fires start from a variety of 
causes. Careless people may not put out their camp fires 
_ after a day’s outing. Smokers may throw away lighted 
| cigarettes, cigars, or matches into the midst of dry leaves. 
ae from the engines of railroad trains may fly into the 
woods. Often lightning crashes into trees and causes a 
conflagration. People may even set them on purpose for 
removing the leaf litter so grass may grow for grazing. 
Posters, Fire-Warnings, Laws.—The best way to stop 
_ fires is never to start them. So in the national forests the 
| Goverment has laws forbidding people to set fire to the 
_ woods, and punishing them for being careless or purposely 
ndangering the trees. In this way many hundreds of 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  100 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
fires are prevented. The United States is a big place. 
We have within our boundaries many nationalities, so 
it naturally follows that many people speaking foreign 
tongues visit or live in the midst of our forests; and in 
order that they may learn concerning fire damage and 
the laws against starting fires in the woods; warnings are 
printed in several languages besides English. In the for- 
ests of the Southwest, near Mexico, many are published 
in Spanish, since this is the speech of numbers of people 
in that section. In the forests bordering Canada, French is 
used as well as English. In forests where railroads are 
being built, many posters in Italian are displayed because 
construction-gangs are often composed largely of Italians. 
Good Business Management.—Foresters handle these 
national forests like a business. They sell timber from them 
but they do not cut it all away. They cut only certain 
trees, leaving young and thrifty ones to keep growing and 
to be felled and used in their turn when they are big enough. 
Then the foresters see that the brush from the trees is 
piled and burned in such a way that it does not kill the 
young growth. The United States Government receives the 
money from the timber as it is sold. Usually one of the for- 
esters has in charge timber sales on his particular forest. 
When there is any sizable sale to be made, that is, over $100 
worth, notice is given out publicly through newspapers days 
in advance. Great lumbering concerns then send in bids to 
the supervisor, offering to buy the timber. The best all- 
round bargain for the United States is the one accepted 
by him, it having been previously decided that the Govern- 
ment will sell none of the timber on this particular tract 
below a certain sum per 1,000 board feet. This is done 
because it would not be right to let it go at less than it   
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  
  NATIONAL AND STATE FORESTRY Ior 
is really worth. The foresters know pretty closely how 
arge a quantity of lumber will be sold, for they have es- 
timated it carefully before advertising it for sale, and they 
also know its market value. 
After days or weeks, as the case ‘may be, arrange- 
_™ents are made with some company to come in and 
take the special trees that are to be removed from this 
area. The officer who is in charge of this work for the 
_ Government goes into the woods with a marking axe on 
_ the back or pole of which are the letters U.S. He 
_ looks over the timber, selects the trees that are to be re- 
| moved, and, as he chooses them, with the sharp blade he 
cuts out of cach a chip near the ground and then turns the 
_ axe and strikes the cut place just made with the back of 
_ the axe so as to impress the letters U. S. on the wood. 
He then chips another plain mark on the tree high up, in foe 
rder that it can readily be seen by the men who are fell- 
ing. The lower sign is used by the Forest Service to check 
up the work; that is, when the trees are down this sign 
will remain and show that these trees have been the ones 
selected by the forester to be felled. When the logs 
reach the mill, they are measured by the forest officer, 
b he may know exactly for how much timber the lumber 
company must pay. 
Grazing.—In these national forests many thousands of 
sheep, horses, goats, and cattle are grazed. The owners 
_ of these stock pay the Government for the use of this pas- 
ture. Thus the national forests help to supply us with meat, 
_ hides, and wool. 
__| Stream Protection.—As discussed in the previous chapter, 
one of the important purposes of a forest is to protect 
streams. Foresters, therefore, plan to keep plenty of trees 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
102 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
to protect the springs and streams that the forests contain. 
If necessary, they plant trees. 
Road-Building.—The Government builds good roads 
through the national forests. Millions of dollars have been 
spent on this work, and any one may pass over them free 
of charge. These roads go through great wildernesses that 
we could never enter or use except for them. They help 
men to carry on their business by connecting distant places 
one with the other, so that buses and trucks can easily 
travel back and forth carrying mail and food, dry goods, 
sheep, cattle, and many other things. 
Recreation.—Because of these roads it is easy also for 
people to enjoy outings in the forests and to view impres- 
sive scenery that would otherwise be impossible to see. 
The officers of the Forest Service have thought it best to 
provide camp sites at well-chosen places within the forests. 
These are carefully selected. They are often located along 
streams where plenty of pure water is easily obtained be- 
cause our National Government is careful of our health. 
Campers who use these places are requested to keep their 
litter cleaned up and properly. burned to avoid forest fires. 
In this way the next people who come will find clean 
grounds. By being forced to live up to these regulations 
each person learns that he must think of the rights and 
pleasures of others as well as of himself. 
Scenic Beauty.—National forests are made attractive 
and beautiful by the cleaning out of dead-and-down trees 
and the piling and burning of brush after logging. They 
present the appearance of clean woods with thrifty stands 
of vigorous trees. 
Other Duties of the United States Forest Service.—The 
United States Forest Service has other things to do in
-P-A-G-E-113
    NATIONAL AND STATE FORESTRY : 103 
addition to the taking care of these forests. It conducts 
experiment stations where many kinds of trees are tested 
out so that the best may be planted. Some of the foresters 
study tree diseases and write upon these subjects, and this 
information is given to any people who ask for it. Other 
foresters in the Service prepare motion-picture reels and 
slides for the public; while others write and deliver lec- 
tures. Exhibits at fairs are given by them. 
Co-operation.— There is a special division in the Service 
that uses all its time in helping the states carry on their 
state forest fire prevention work. In fact, the National 
Government gives money to state forestry departments to 
aid in this. There are many more ways in which the United 
States Forest Service works for us. When any state for- 
estry department receives aid from the United States 
Forest Service in this manner, it is called co-operation. 
STATE FORESTRY 
State Forests.—State forests are taken care of and man- 
aged very much as are national forests. They are not so 
\large nor so numerous, and they are not under the control 
of the United States Government, but are handled by the 
forestry departments of the states. Pennsylvania and New 
York have more state forests than any other states in the 
Union, and Minnesota and Wisconsin also have big acre- 
ages. Many of the states which own no forests now will 
probably have them in the future. State forests are needed 
just as much as are National Forests. They bring money to 
the states’ treasuries from their timber sales and other forms 
of business. States need forests to teach proper forest man- 
agement to the people, and, besides, they are recreation 
   
-P-A-G-E-114
104 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US | 
grounds, and are of value in preserving the scenic beauty 
and wild life. 
Other Duties of State Departments of Forestry.—State 
forestry departments direct their attention particularly to 
forest fire prevention all over their own states. They put up 
forest fire posters along roadsides and fight the forest fires 
everywhere they can. Many conduct tree nurseries. They 
aid farmers in caring for woodlands and in growing new 
stands of timber, besides giving lectures, motion-picture 
shows on forestry, and exhibits at fairs. They co-operate 
with lumbermen, landowners, and counties in all manner 
of ways in forestry, as the laws of the states permit. They 
distribute forestry literature and publish data about con- 
ditions of lumber and various wood using industries of 
their states. One of the important kinds of work they are 
doing is the reclamation of waste lands. How this is ac- 
complished will be described in another chapter. In fact. 
everything they can do for the benefit of forests is part of 
their work. 
We should all be interested in National and State 
Forestry.

CHAPTER IX 
THE MORE IMPORTANT WOODS AND THEIR USES 
No doubt all the boys and girls of America have read of 
| “the wonderful one-hoss shay” that was built by the old 
New England deacon (so the poem goes), that “ran a hun- 
dred years to a day.” and ‘“‘then, of a sudden,”’ went all to 
pieces 
“in a heap or mound 
As if it had been to the mill and ground.” 
The Wood Used in the “One-Hoss Shay.’—The old- 
fashioned shay was, like our present day carriages, built 
largely of wood. To the deacon who built this shay it was 
‘Mighty plain 
That the weakest place mus’ stan’ the strain; 
| ’N’ the way to fix it— 
| Is only jest 
T’ make that place uz strong uz the rest.” 
He was very careful, therefore, to select just the right 
kind of wood for each part of the vehicle. 
“So the Deacon enquired of the village folk 
Where he could find the strongest oak 
That couldn’t be split nor bent nor broke,— 
That was for spokes, and floor and sills; 
He sent for lancewood to make the thills; 
The crossbars were ash from the straightest trees. 
The panels of whitewood, that cuts like cheese 
105 
   
-P-A-G-E-116
  106 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
But.lasts like iron for things like these; 
The hubs of logs from the ‘Settler’s ellum,’— 
Last of its timber,—they couldn’t sell ’em, 
Never an axe had seen their chips, 
And the wedges flew from between their lips, 
Their blunt ends frizzled like celery tips.” 
Learning the Uses of Wood.—It is not difficult to discover 
the various uses made of different kinds of wood. Wood, 
as you have seen earlier in this book, is used in many, 
many things that we construct. All we need to do, there- 
fore, is to look about us and learn the names of the woods 
that are used in desks, tables, chairs, doors, floors, siding, 
roofs, fences, and a hundred and one other things. In this 
chapter you will find out something about the most useful 
woods of our country. Let us begin with oak. 
Uses of Oak.—Oak, in general, is a strong wood, and re- 
sists wear well, for it is hard. The deacon was wise, there- 
fore, in selecting it for parts in his shay. Where did he 
use it? One would not say that it is an ideal wood, for 
there is none such; but oak is admirably fitted for many 
purposes. It may be said to be a genera!-utility wood, that 
is, a wood having many uses. We have already learned 
that there are several kinds of oaks growing in our country. 
Some are better fitted for certain uses than others. We will 
merely discuss oaks in general here. 
If we were to visit some of the great cathedrals in Eng- 
land, France, or Germany, we should find still sound oak 
beams that have been in these churches for more than 800 
years. Oak logs that are probably many thousands of 
years old are often encountered in the earth when wells are 
being dug or excavations made. Most woods decay very 
slowly if kept dry all the time, or kept wet. In either case
-P-A-G-E-117
  
  WOODS AND THEIR USES 107 
bacteria and fungi are not able to bring about rapid decay. 
Oak resists decay fairly well under most conditions. It 
is, therefore, selected for railroad ties, for fence posts, for 
rails, for water wheels on river steamers, for bridges, for 
ship planking, for barrels, and many other things which 
are exposed to the weather. It splits easily, and thus the 
making by hand of fence posts and rails and shingles (called 
shakes) is not difficult. 
Oak in Our Homes.—Oak is’ beautiful when sawed, 
planed, sandpapered, and stained. The stain penetrates 
the porous portions readily and darkens them, so that beau- 
tiful patterns of nature’s own design are produced. The 
patterns of quarter-sawed oak (Chapter X tells how quar- 
ter-sawed oak is made) are particularly pleasing. Because 
of its beauty, its strength, its resistance to wear and decay, 
oak is much used in the making of furniture, in floors in 
houses and public buildings, and for interior woodwork 
(called “trim” by carpenters). Its great cost would not 
permit its use, as rough lumber in buildings, even though 
it were not so hard to saw and plane and nail. (Chapter X 
describes the making of oak doors, oak veneer, and oak 
furniture.) 
Chestnut and Its Uses.—Chestnut wood has many of 
the same uses as oak. It is rich in tannin, as one can readily 
see by laying a water-soaked chip of chestnut wood on 
white paper. (See Chapter X for a discussion of the making 
of tannic acid.) Chestnut is as durable as oak, if not more 
so; hence it is much used for fence posts and telegraph 
| poles. It is not so suitable for railroad ties as oak, because 
it is soft, nor does it work up as well in furniture. Its 
grain is coarse and the medullary rays (see page 17) are 
lacking or too small to be readily seen. However, it is 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  
108 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
worked more easily than oak, and may take on a beautiful 
color when ammonia fumes penetrate it. Chestnut furniture 
has not the quality that the better oak furniture has. 
Some Uses of Hickory.—The lancewood used by the 
deacon in the thills (or shafts) of the shay was probably 
hickory. This wood is very hard, very elastic, and very 
strong, just the right sort of wood for a lance or a spear 
handle. When steamed, it may be readily bent, and will 
retain the bend fairly well. This makes it suitable for 
thills. Hickory is used for teeth in wooden rakes, for 
handles of tools, for runners on light sleds, for wagon axles, 
and whiffletrees. Second-growth hickory, which is largely 
made up of sapwood, is very tough, tougher than the wood 
of the old trees, and is the best for the making of spokes 
for the carriage and automobile wheels, ‘and for golf sticks. 
The spindle backs and arms of the well-known expensive 
Windsor chairs are of hickory (1 Hickory may be readily split 
when wet, and, if care is used, thin strips may be obtained. 
It is well suited for the making of baskets, therefore, and 
rough, coarse brooms. Many people in the thinly settled 
portions of our country where hickory grows make hick- 
ory baskets and brooms. Have you ever seen any of them? 
The Many Uses of Ash.—Ash has many of the same uses 
as oak. It is lighter than oak, not so strong, not so hard, 
yet more elastic. It lacks the beauty that oak wood has, 
but, if stained carefully, it may be made to resemble com- 
mon oak. It is not durable when exposed to the weather, 
is hard to work, yet it separates or splits readily, like hick- 
ory, into thin strips. Which of the above qualities makes it 
suitable for each of the following uses: interior woodwork, 
cabinetwork, barrel hoops, baskets, spear handles, oars and 
paddles, baseball bats, parts of farm implements, parts of
-P-A-G-E-119
    
  WOODS AND THEIR USES 10g 
\ 
carriages? Why is it not used for fence posts, telephone 
poles, for clapboards, or shingles, for rough lumber in housé 
building ? 
Linden and Poplar—There are many woods that are so 
easily worked that we may say they cut “like cheese,” and 
some of them are light in color as well as light in weight. 
The wood of the linden, or basswood, has these character- 
istics, and so also does the poplar, also called tulip tree or 
| whitewood. (See Chapter III.) The wood of the linden and 
poplar are much alike in general characteristics. Poplar is 
stronger than the wood of the linden, it is more clastic, and 
it is more durable. Both work well, do not warp easily, and 
both nail well. Linden, because it is without taste and 
odor, is much used for butter and lard trays, berry boxes, 
and tubs. Poplar clapboards and poplar interior wood- 
work are common in houses in many parts of our country. 
On the farm one will find that most of the wooden pumps 
are poplar, for the wood is durable, and so soft that the 
making of the bore by an auger is not difficult. Because it 
is light and strong, it is much used for carriage bodies, 
coach bodies, wagon boxes, and shipping boxes. Why 
would poplar be good to use in the frame of kites? dugout 
canoes? Why did the deacon use it in the box of the shay ? 
The Tough Elm.—Elm wood, used for the hubs of the 
wheels of the one-horse shay, has little value as a commer- 
cial wood. It is not even much used for wood in the kitchen 
stove, because it is split only with great difficulty. This 
latter characteristic, howéver, makes it admirable for the 
hubs of wheels. The rock elm, because it is very durable, 
is the particular species of elm that furnishes wood for 
hubs. Elm lumber warps badly, but is made into barrel 
staves and boxes because it is fairly light in weight. When
-P-A-G-E-120
  110 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
soaked in hot water it cuts readily in veneer machines. Its 
toughness makes it suitable for flooring in barns. 
Some Uses of Beech Wood.—Beech wood is similar in 
color to rock elm. It is heavier than elm, and harder. and 
stronger. Like elm, it does not split readily. The wood 
portion of most carpenters’ wooden planes is beech. 
Beech wood, as well as maple, is used in the making of 
school desks, boxes, barrels, casks, handles for chisels, 
shoe lasts, the axles and shafts of water wheels, and floors. 
Maple Is Hard and Strong.—Some people find difficulty 
in telling maple wood from beech. Maple is much harder 
and stronger than beech, and has about the same weight 
and much the same color. Both take on a high polish, but 
are very hard to work up in furniture where there must be 
planing, chiselling, and nailing. The hardness of maple 
makes it suitable for the tops, backs, and seats of school 
desks, for flooring, for shoe lasts, handles of tools, and 
wooden type and spacing blocks in printing shops. Have 
you ever seen curly maple or bird’s-eye maple furniture ? 
Some people think it very beautiful. To bring out the pat- 
tern of the wood it is necessary to keep the natural 
color of the: wood, and to most people this light color is 
objectionable. No one knows just why some maple trees 
have curly wood or bird’s-eye wood. It may be found in 
almost any species of maple. Only experienced woodsmen 
can detect trees in the forests that have bird’s-eye or curly 
wood. 
Walnut, a Beautiful Wood.—Another tree whose wood 
is much used for furniture is the walnut. There is no more 
beautiful wood on the market unless it be mahogany, and 
this is probably preferred by some chiefly because it has to 
be imported and is therefore more.expensive than walnut.
-P-A-G-E-121
    
  WOODS AND THEIR USES Td 
Walnut has a natural beautiful brown color. Cabinet 
makers find it easy to work with, for it does not split 
readily, and can be planed easily and takes a fine polish. 
Walnut furniture is strong and yet light in weight. Some 
of our most expensive furniture is made of walnut. Dur- 
ing the World War, large numbers of walnut trees were 
cut and made up into gun stocks and parts of airplanes. 
Woods Used in Furniture.—-Walnut is now becoming so 
scarce, and hence expensive, that much so-called walnut 
furniture is not walnut at all, but is merely gum, or some 
other less expensive wood stained a walnut shade. Walnut 
veneer furniture is also very common. Perhaps you have 
seen some. Look at the edges of walnut table tops, piano 
cases, talking machine cases, bookcases. Veneer furniture 
is not, as some think, inferior furniture. Oak, curly maple, 
bird’s-eye maple, mahogany, as well as walnut, are used in 
making veneer furniture. Chapter X describes the various 
| ways of making veneer. 
Sweet Gum Used as Substitutes.—Sweet gum, or red 
gum, is a good cabinet wood, although not so expensive as 
walnut, chiefly because it is more plentiful. It polishes well 
and stains well, and, like walnut, is close-grained. It there- 
fore takes a uniform stain. It is stained so as to imitate 
walnut, mahogany, or Circassian walnut, and is used in 
medium priced furniture. In bedsteads, for example, the 
panels may be of walnut or mahogany veneer, but the legs. 
and sides are likely to be of sweet gum. Sweet gum may 
also be used as the base for the walnut or mahogany veneer. . 
Imitation Circassian walnut is made in furniture factories 
| by sketching on boards, with charcoal, the figure or design 
_ of the grain of the real Circassian walnut. The boards are 
then stained and varnishell, the stain and varnish fixing 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  Le OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
the figures drawn in charcoal. If the charcoal lines are 
well drawn, it is difficult to distinguish between the genuine 
Circassian walnut and the imitation. Sweet gum wood is 
not durable if exposed to weathering influences; besides, 
it warps and twists in seasoning in the open. It is used for 
interior finish and for making sliced and turned veneer 
for boxes and trays. 
The Conifers.—The most important timber trees of our 
country are the conifers or cone bearing trees, several of 
which were described in a preceding chapter. Make a list 
of the coniferous, trees described there. 
Cedar in Pencils and Chests.—The wood of some of our 
lead pencils is red cedar, and red cedar chests are consid- 
ered necessary in most households. The odor of cedar is 
thought to keep moths away. It is very likely, however, 
that woollen clothes and furs kept in cedar chests are pro- 
tected from moths chiefly because the chest is so tight that 
moths cannot get in. Large cedar trees are cut for tele- 
phone or telegraph poles, and small ones for cedar posts. 
Cypress, the Wood Everlasting.—Oak and chestnut, as 
we have seen, are very durable woods, but not so durable: 
as cypress. Cypress, which, as we have learned, grows in 
marshy places in the Mississippi valley and the coastal 
swamps, well deserves the name that is given to it, the 
“wood everlasting.” It is a very soft wood and light in 
weight, but it has a beautiful grain, and its durability is 
probably due to the pitch or resin in it. Cypress is about 
_as expensive as oak, because it is hard to lumber or 
log, as it grows in swamps through which road building 
is difficult. In most cases tramways have to be built 
to get above the water and the ‘‘knees” that come up 
from the roots. Can you give reasons why cypress is used

WOODS AND THEIR USES I13 
for shingles, for planking in cisterns, for siding on houses, 
for ‘interior woodwork, for window sash and frames, for 
doors, and for boats? 
The Useful Pines.—Of all the conifers, the pines are the 
most important. Ever since America was settled they have 
been furnishing lumber for construction work of many 
sorts. As a consequence the pine forests of our country are 
fast disappearing. The pines are the most widely distrib- 
uted of the major families of trees. Every large section 
of our country has, or has had, its forests of pine. Which 
lone, previously described, grows in the North? which in 
the South? which in the West? 
Yellow Pine in the South.—Vellow pine is the “universal 
wood” of the Southern States, and is now being shipped 
ito all parts of the South, and even into the Northern States 
as far east as New England. Most frame houses of the 
South are made up almost entirely of yellow pine. The 
ar, pitch, and turpentine that the Southern States have 
been furnishing the world for 300 years are products ob- 
tained, in a crude form or by manufacture, from some of 
he Southern pines. (See Chapter X.) 
White Pine in the North.—The great demand for the 
white pine of the Northern States is due to the many 
excellent qualities of the wood. The wood is nearly 
hite, light in weight, soft and thus easily worked, takes 
nails without splitting, and resists weathering. There 
are many old frame houses of New England one hun- 
dred or more years old and still in excellent condition 
that are made of pine. The wood is resinous, but not so 
much so as most of the Southern pines. It planes easily 
nd takes a fine, smooth finish. When used for “trim” in 
Stic it is usually painted, rarely or never stained, be- 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  
114 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
cause it does not show a grain. Why is it excellent for 
matches? for packing boxes? for clapboards on houses? 
Western Yellow Pine.—The Western yellow pine is used 
for regular construction work, in houses, barns, and 
bridges. Largely because of the lack of better timber it is 
used for railroad ties and fence posts and boards. The 
wood is fairly hard, and brittle and quite resinous. It is 
seddish in color and close-grained. Nails are driven through 
it only with difficulty, because they bend at the ‘hard 
resinous bands; besides, it splits readily. 
Douglas Fir, a Useful Conifer.—The most used timber of 
the Western States is the Douglas fir. The wood is hard, 
strong, and resists weathering well. Because of these 
qualities, besides the great size of the timbers that may be 
sawed from the logs, Douglas fir is in much demand for 
ship timber and for bridges. It is used also for general 
construction and railroad ties. Because of its coarse grain 
the wood is not so beautiful as cypress, Southern pine, and 
some of the other conifers. But it is much used for doors, 
window-frames, and interior trim. It is the general con- 
struction wood of the Pacific Northwest, and is being used 
in many other parts of our country. (See Chapter III.) 
Redwood Also a “Wood Everlasting.’—The superior 
qualities of redwood are much advertised in our magazines. 
Have you ever seen any such advertisements? Its freedom 
from resin makes it fire resisting to some extent. The wood 
has a soft, light-red color that is pleasing, and takes an ex- 
cellent polish. 
It is used, therefore, for the interior trim of houses. In 
the better houses the wood is left unvarnished and un- 
stained, wax only being used to give it a polish. It is a 
“wood everlasting,” like cypress, and therefore finds great

use in shingles, planking for tanks, staves for barrels,

redwood because it is soft and saws and planes easily.

  CHAPTER X 
THE WOODWORKING INDUSTRIES AND THEIR 
PRODUCTS 
Making a Home in Pioneer Days.—When the pioneers 
made their first settlements in the forests of the eastern 
United States, the building of homes was much more simple 
than it is to-day. An axe and a saw and perhaps a broad- 
axe and an adz were about the only tools used for making 
the log cabin and their furnishings. The trees of the forest 
selected for the walls of the cabin (or house) were felled by 
the axe and the saw (if the builders were fortunate enough 
to have the latter), hauled or dragged to the place selected 
for the building, and with an axe the ends of the logs were 
notched in such a way that they would fit securely into each 
other at the corners of the building. With the help of some 
neighbors the entire house was completed within a few 
days. The roof was made of oak shakes (or “boards”. 
For these, blocks of oak about two feet long were split 
into thin pieces six or eight inches wide and about a quarter 
to a half inch thick. Three-sided strips of wood split from 
logs six to ten feet long were driven in between the logs of 
the walls to fill the chinks. Clay or plaster filled the smaller 
cracks and kept out the rain, wind, cold, and insect pests. 
Doors and floors, as well as the furniture, were usually 
made of hewn or split pieces of wood. Puncheon (see the 
dictionary for the definition of this werd) floors were very 
common. Is there a log house or cabin in your neighbor- 
hood? Get some old gentleman to tell you how it was 
made and how long it took, how the chimney was con- 
structed, the windows, the furniture.

    THE WOODWORKING INDUSTRIES Il7 
Building and Furnishing a Modern Home.—In our day 
the building of a large house in a city, say, requires the 
services of carpenters, masons, plumbers, electricians, 
furnace men, painters, tinners, roofing men, and paper

‘There are hundreds of these portable mills in the eastern United States. The logs are gener ally brought to the mill by wagon and team, Latile of the waste can be utilized. 
hangers. And all these artificers merely put together and 
arrange articles already manufactured which require the 
services of scores or even hundreds of other men to pro- 
duce. To prepare the wood or lumber used in the building 
of a house calls for sawmills, planing mills, flooring factories, 
sash and door factories, and many others. The furniture 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  118 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
put into the house has passed through, from the trees in 
the forest to the completed furniture, many machines in 
many factories. To understand all the work necessary to 
make a door, a window, or a piece of furniture you should 
visit some of the wood working factories near your home. If 
there is nothing more than a small portable sawmill in your 
neighborhood, go to see how it works. In large sawmills, in 
planing mills, and furniture factories, one will find many won- 
derful machines. Every boy and girl ought to know just 
what work goes on in each factory in the neighborhood. 
That we may get a better idea of the large number of 
men it takes to make some of our articles of wood and of 
the large number of machines used, let us follow the logs 
from the forest to the oak doors of a schoolroom, your 
schoolroom. (Some doors are made of pine or other woods.) 
By inquiry we may find exactly where the doors were made. 
Let us talk about an oak door in a schoolroom in Middle 
Tennessee. Let us suppose that, on inquiry, we have found 
that the door was made in a planing mill in Nash- 
ville. 
The Trees in the Forest.—The trees that furnished the 
wood for this oak door grew on the flood plain of one of the 
tributaries of the upper Cumbeiland River near the 
northern boundary of Tennessee. Find the probable lo- 
cation of the forest on the map of Tennessee or of the 
Southern States in your geography. 
Making the Raft.—In the late fall, when the farmer on 
whose land these trees grew had cut his last bit of corn and 
had finished his fall ploughing and sowing, he began 
logging operations. He had contracted to furnish several 
hundred logs to a sawmill company whose mills were on 
the Cumberland at Nashville, nearly 300 miles distant by

water. With the help of his hired men several fine trees 
that had grown close together (in a “close stand’’) and 
| therefore had long straight trunks and were quite free from

large lower limbs, were felled, trimmed of their branches, 
cut into lengths of ten, twelve, fourteen, or sixteen feet, 
and hauled to the river bank. Here they lay until the » 
arrival of a raftsman in the employ of the company. At 
length they were assembled side by side and fastened to- 
   
-P-A-G-E-130
  
120 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE .US 
gether, some eighty to a hundred or more in number, to 
form a raft.* Since the logs were green and heavy and 
floated very low in the water, it was found necessary to 
put into the raft a few poplar logs so as to give it buoy- 
ancy. Heavy logs are often lost by becoming “water- 
logged.” Most raftsmen, particularly if their raft is to be 
largely of oak, mix in wood lighter in weight. A small plat- 
form of boards about four by six feet was placed near the 
centre of the raft and on this was built a “‘lean-to,” a small 
house. Sweeps, paddles on long poles, were provided for 
the front and rear ends of the raft that it might be con- 
trolled in the currents of the river and kept off sand-bars. 
With these preparations complete there remained only the 
provisioning of the crude craft. Most raftsmen take food 
enough to last them the whole journey. Can you calculate 
how many days it would take to travel the 300 miles if the 
raft floats down-stream three miles an hour and travelled 
only about ten hours a day? Would you not like to take a 
trip on such a raft? Can you imagine some of the expe- 
riences one would have on such a journey? 
The Logs Go to the Sawmill—When the raft reached 
Nashville it was moored (tied to a tree on the river bank 
by means of ropes) awaiting the time the logs would be 
needed in the mill. In a few days} the raft was broken 
*Some raftsmen use hickory saplings about two inches in diameter as 
“binders.” These are placed crosswise of the logs on top. Each runs across 
some half dozen or more logs. Wooden pins driven into auger holes bored 
through the hickory sapling into the logs below hold the logs to the “bind- 
ers.” “Chain dogs”—a chain with iron pins at the ends—are also used 
by some. The chain is placed over the hickory “binder,” the dogs are 
driven into the log on either side. 
} The logs are generally left in the water until needed in the sawmill. 
This: in some cases may be several months. Logs under water, wholly or 
partially, are generally protected from insect pests,  
-P-A-G-E-131
    THE WOODWORKING INDUSTRIES I2r 
up and each log in its turn found its way to the sawmill to 
be made into slabs, edgings, boards, planks (one and one- 
half inches to six inches in thickness), scantlings, and 
timbers. Slabs and edgings are always “waste” and are 
burned at the mill in the furnaces to make steam or are sold 
for fuel for homes. When you visit a sawmill, try to find 
| out how the slabs are cut off, where the edgings come 
from, and how boards, planks, scantling, and timbers are 
made. 
The Lumber Yard.—From the sawmill the rough lumber 
—this is the technical name for the lumber products of the 
sawmill—went to the lumber yard to await purchasers 
or the time it would be needed for secondary manufac- 
ture. In the yard, the lumber from these logs, like that 
from other logs, was piled (or “‘stacked’”’) so that it would 
dry as readily as possible and be protected from rains and 
the sun. Talk with the man who works in some lumber 
yard, if one is near, and see if he can tell you why he piles 
the lumber as he does. 
Seasoning the Lumber.—If lumber is left in the yard 
or is stored in sheds for a long enough time (perhaps 
years), it becomes thoroughly air-dried—“ seasoned”’ is the 
term that is used—and is ready for further manufac- 
ture. Many people think that air-dried lumber is the very 
best of seasoned lumber. But it is expensive to have lumber 
stand in piles for years, for it represents invested money 
that is paying little interest and profit; besides it is con- 
stantly in danger of being a total loss by fire. Is it not prob- 
able that the cost of insurance would be high? Give rea- 
sons for your answer. When you visit a lumber yard, find 
out what provisions are made for fire protection and fire 
| fighting.  
-P-A-G-E-132
  E22 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
Most of the lumber used in the making of doors and other 
articles nowadays is “kiln-dried.” A kiln is a large, al- 
most air-tight room into which the lumber is put and 
heated by hot, dry air, jor several days. The lumber may 
thus be seasoned within a short time and be ready for the 
door factory. 
The rough lumber which went into the schoolroom doors 
we are discussing, was kiln-dried. After being piled in the 
yard for a few weeks, it was hauled to the kilns, piled up 
loosely with cross-strips between each layer of boards, to 
enable the hot air to get to the surface of the boards, and 
there it remained for several days. From there it went to 
the planing mill. 
The Door Factory.—In the door factory (in most towns 
doors are made in planing mills along with many other 
articles of wood for the building trades) the rough-seasoned 
lumber was first planed and sawed into the right length and 
breadth for the various parts of the door. 
In a moist climate, be there is danger from warping, 
doors are best made of panels, and these panels are framed 
with rails (horizontal pieces) and stiles (vertical pieces). 
To make these parts, the workers use tongue and groove 
machines and planers. The wood for this door we are 
discussing passed through all these machines, each part 
being carefully made so as to fit into its proper place. Then 
came the assembling, or putting together of the parts, fit- 
ting, and glueing. The assembled and glued doors were set 
aside in clamps for several hours to let the glue set, and 
were soon ready for the storeroom, and finally for the 
carpenter. | 
Did you ever stop to dita that a common door had such 
a long story? How would the story of a pine door differ 
i
-P-A-G-E-133
        THE WOODWORKING INDUSTRIES 123 
from that of an oak door? Where would the pine lumber 
probably come from in your part of our country ? 
Many cities and towns have planing mills, sash and 
door factories, and flooring factories. You should visit 
some. 
Making Furniture.—The story of pieces of furniture 
would be much the same, for many of these are made 
in planing mills and most of the machines in furniture 
factories are similar to those in such mills. Furniture fac- 
tories are not so numerous as sawmills and plaiuing mills, 
but are widely distributed. Most of the furniture that the 
people of the United States use is made in a few large furni- 
ture centres. Grand Rapids is, in many ways, the most 
important furniture-making centre in our country. Boston, 
Chicago, San Francisco, and High Point (North Carolina), 
are also leading centres. 
Solid and Veneer Furniture.—No doubt you have heard 
of furniture of “solid” oak, or “solid” walnut, or “solid” 
mahogany. One may still buy such furniture, but now 
furniture with veneer parts is more common. The better 
woods in our country, like oak, walnut, and maple, have 
become so expensive that it has been found necessary, 
except in the very expensive pieces of furniture, to use the 
veneer of these woods instead of the ‘“‘solid’”’ wood. Figure 
50 shows the structure of a table-top of veneer oak. Note 
that the board to which the veneer is attached is inex- 
pensive wood. Walnut or mahogany instead of oak may 
be used as veneer material. Furniture with veneer parts 
is strong and is not so subject to warping or splitting as 
“solid” furniture. It must not get water-soaked, however. 
Can you tell why? Veneer furniture should not be used on 
open porches or left out on lawns. 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
: 
124 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
Making Veneer.—Veneer may be made in any one of 
three ways. Some is shaved in large machines. The timber 
that furnishes the wood for the veneer is held firmly by | 
strong clamps, and a huge knife shaves off thin strips of 
wood, much as your mother cuts off slices of bread from a 
loaf or the butcher shaves off by hand thin slices of dried 
beef. Veneer may also be made in rotary veneer machines. 
Logs six, eight, or ten feet long are fastened securely in a 
rotating device much like a turning-lathe and are rotated 
slowly. A huge knife slices thin layers of wood off the out- 
side of the turning log. 
Sawed Veneer.—Sawed veneer is made much as are 
boards. The layers are only about one-twentieth to one- 
thirty-second of an inch thick, however. A carriage is used 
as in a sawmill, but the timbers, which have already been 
prepared in a sawmill, are very securely clamped to the 
carriage so that there can be no “play” (no movement, or 
“sive”). The saw also is made so that it will not bend. 
Can you see why it is necessary to be so careful to prevent 
“play”? 
Making a Table Top.—In the furniture factory, if a 
veneer table top is to be made, the strips of veneer are glued 
to boards or inexpensive wood, which we may call fillers. 
The veneer strips are first planed or smoothed with sand- 
paper, covered with glue, and pressed firmly against the 
boards, the fillers, and then set away to let the glue dry. 
Each veneered board is then handled as if it were an ordi- 
nary board. Most table tops are made up of several 
boards, as you may readily see if you examine them care- 
fully. 
Two-Ply and Three-Ply Veneer.—Some parts of furni- 
ture, particularly panels, are made of two-ply or three-ply
-P-A-G-E-135
    THE WOODWORKING INDUSTRIES 125, 
veneer. Study Figure 51 to see if you can tell how two-ply 
or three-ply panels are built up. The strongest two-ply or 
three-ply is made by crossing the grain of the pieces of 
veneer. Study Figure 44 and explain how thisisdone. Berry 
boxes, lard and butter trays, and some packing boxes are 
of single veneer, usually turned or shaved. Some of the 
strongest and lightest (in weight) packing boxes are of two- 
| ply or three-ply veneer. The next time you visit the gro- 
cery store ask the grocer to show you crates, boxes, and

baskets made of veneer. Fruits, potatoes, green vegetables, 
poultry, and eggs are sent to markets, often shipped hun- 
dreds of miles, from the orchards, farms, and gardens in 
containers made of veneer. Besides being light (thus saving 
in freight charges) and strong, they are inexpensive. Think 
how heavy and how expensive containers of metal would be. 
Making Quarter-Sawed Oak.—You all have heard of 
quarter-sawed oak, no doubt, and quarter-sawed oak furni- 
ture. If you examine the cross-section of an oak log (see Fig- 
ure 52), you will see a series of concentric rings—the annual 
rings—and cutting across these rings radiating out from the 
centre are numerous shiny, thin streaks in the wood. These

  quarter-sawed in 
order that these rays may show on the surface of the 
lumber in small patches or strips. Figs. 53 and 54 show 
how plane oak differs from quarter-sawed oak in appear- 
ance. Quarter-sawed oak is much more expensive than 
plane oak, because it is more difficult to make at saw- 
mills, and besides, there is much waste in wood in sawing it. 
To get these rays on the surface of the board it is

necessary to make the “saw-cut” nearly along the 
line of the rays. The log kas a rule is first quartered. Then 
each quarter is sawed seqarately. Fig 56 shows one way 
of sawing out the boardg. The cross-lined portions are 
waste. 
If the quarter is cut up into timbers or planks instead of 
boards, these planks may be sawed in the veneer mill into 
veneer that shows the rays on the surface. Such veneer is 
known as quarter-sawed veneer. It is this oak veneer that 
is used in the best oak veneer furniture.

Axe Handle and Spoke Factories.—In the hardwood 
areas small axe handle and spoke factories are quite com- 
mon. These have special machinery quite too complicated 
to be described here. To understand how the machines 
work, you should see them in operation. Hickory, as you 
have learned, is the chief wood used in the making of 
handles and spokes. 
Cooperage Factories.—Cooperage factories that turn out 
material for barrels, pails, casks, and tubs are found in many 
parts of our country. The cooper’s trade is a very old one, 
for there has long been great need for its products. Tight
-P-A-G-E-138
  
  128 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
cooperage requires the services of skilled workers, for the 
barrel must be water-tight and must bear severe strains dur- 
ing its transportation, particularly when filled with heavy 
liquids. Examine an oil barrel or a syrup or molasses barrel 
and note at what places in 
the making of the barrel 
great skill is needed. 
As Loose or dry or slack

Fic. 56. One Way of Cutting Quarter. Pails, etc.) is made from 
sawed Oaks light-colored softwood, as 
poplar, basswood, or ash. 
Wood used in cooperage must not give an odor or a taste 
to the liquids or dry materials. 
The Naval Stores Industry.—A very large industry that 
has been carried on for about 200 years in the South is 
the one that produces naval ‘stores. Tar, pitch, and tur- 
pentine are the products. In the large dictionary in your 
schoolroom find the. meaning of the term, naval stores. 
Naval stores are derived from the Southern pine. In what. 
States does this pine grow? 
The pine tree is tapped by making a shallow cut through 
the bark near the base of the trunk. Into this cut is driven 
a metal gutter. The sap of the tree, called resin, exudes and 
runs into the metal gutter and thence into clay cups. This is 
the best method of tapping pine trees. An older method, 
  barrels, lime barrels, barrels ..

still much in use, soon kills the trees. This sap in the cups 
is called crude turpentine. From crude turpentine oil of 
turpentine is distilled in large copper stills. Resin is the 
residue. 
Making Tar and Turpentine.—Tar is made in two quite 
different ways. The crudest way is to pile up the roots, 
branches, and trunks of pine trees in a pit and cover the pile 
with sod. The wood is set on fireand allowed to smoulder

away for a long time. The resin of the wood is melted, runs 
out, and is collected in a catch-basin on one side of the pit. 
It is black and sticky. This is the tar. A better method is 
to put the roots and trunks into a big cylinder called a re- 
| tort. The retort is closed air-tight and is heated to a high 
temperature. Gaseous matter is driven off by the heat. 
From this gaseous matter, which is reduced to a liquid by 
cooling, many substances may be obtained, as tar, oil of 
pine, and spirits of turpentine. Tar and charcoal remain 
in the retort. (See Figure 57. 
Making Wood Alcohol.—Hardwoods heated in retorts 
give gaseous materials wholly unlike those from pine wood.
-P-A-G-E-140
  130 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
These gaseous materials may be separated, by processes too 
difficult to describe here, and make acetic acid, wood alco- 
hol, and wood tar. It is hard to realize that the clear liquid 
wood alcohol was once a part of solid wood. Charcoal is one 
of the substances left in the cylinder. (See Figure 58.) 
Making Paper.—In the first chapter you were told that 
paper is now made largely from wood. The wood most com- 
monly used, you have learned in a previous chapter, is spruce,

country, and in Canada and Alaska. There are small spruce 
forests on the upper slopes of the mountains of North Caro- 
lina, Tennessee, and Virginia, but these are not much used 
for paper, for there is not a large supply. In the Southern 
States pine and other softwoods and the softer hardwoods 
are the chief pulp woods. 
Tear a piece of paper and look carefully at the edges of 
the torn parts. You will see that paper is made of short 
fibres matted together. The cheap paper for newspaper is 
made by grinding pulp wood into fibre by pressing it against 
a revolving rough stone. The fibre is carried away by water 
to big vessels. From these vessels the fibre, suspended in the

the fibrous mass passes and is pressed into thin sheets. Tear 
up blotting paper and put a small handful into a glass of 
water. Let the torn paper soak for a day or two and then 
shake thoroughly. The resulting pulpy mass is just like the 
pulp before it passes through the rollers. 
The better grades of wood-pulp paper are made feats 
spruce, poplar, or aspen trees of medium size. The pulp 
wood—in the form of blocks eight to twelve inches in diam- 
eter and about three or four feet long—is cut into small chips 
by knives on a revolving wheel or disk. The chips are 
bruised by passing between rollers, and then they are car- 
ried to great boilers where they are boiled for a long time in 
chemical solutions which break them up into fibres. The 
fibrous mass, now known as pulp or paper pulp, then moves 
to great rollers which press it into long thick sheets of pulp. 
Some factories produce pulp only. The pulp is sent to other 
factories where it is again carefully treated with chemicals, 
agitated in water, and sent to the rollers that roll out 
paper. 
The lint of cotton is now being used in the South to make 
paper, but the demand for paper is so great that there is lint 
enough to supply only a small part of the fibre for paper. 
Forests Furnish Tannic Acid.—Did you ever stop to 
think that even the shoes you wear, the leather of harnesses, 
the belting used in factories, and the leather of the better 
carriages and automobile tops and upholstery depend on the 
forests. Tannin for the tanning of leather comes, in our 
country, largely from oak and hemlock bark, and chestnut 
wood. For a long time tanning was done near the forests, 
where bark could be easily obtained. Now tannic acid fac- 
tories located near large supplies of wood and bark make a

  132 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
concentrated form of tannic acid and send this hundreds 
of miles, even across the Atlantic Ocean, to tanneries. 
If you boil up small pieces of oak or hemlock bark or 
chestnut wood in water, you will get a dark-colored liquid. 
This suggests the way tannic acid is extracted from these. 
woods. The wood or bark is cut up or broken up into small 
chips, in machines like those used in pulp and paper mills 
making the better grades of paper. These are boiled in water 
for some time in large strong cylinders. The water now dark 
with the tannic acid is drained off and evaporated to a thick 
liquid. In this form it is transported more easily than is the 
bark. In some tannic acid factories the liquid is evaporated 
to tannic acid powder. 
In this chapter you have learned only of the more im- 
portant woodworking industries and industries using wood. 
Do you have any others not mentioned here in your locality ?

CHAPTER XI 
Part I 
CONSERVATION OF OUR FOREST RESOURCES 
The Original Forests of the United States.—At the time 
that Jamestown was settled the forested lands of the part of 
North America that is now the United States covered about 
822,000,000 acres. Figure 1 shows the part of our country 
that was forested. If John Smith had started out to travel 
westward from Jamestown to the Pacific, he would have 
travelled through almost unbroken stretches of beautiful 
forests to the eastern portion of what is now Kansas. 
From there westward to the mountains he would have 
passed over grasslands with trees growing only along the 
streams. The Rocky Mountains had forests mainly on the 
middle and upper slopes. West of the Rockies, in what is 
now Utah and Nevada, he would have seen forests only on 
the middle and upper slopes of the mountains and ridges, 
for as in the Rockies the level land between the mountains 
and the lower slopes is too dry for tree growth. He would 
have found the Sierra Nevadas heavily forested. The Great 
Valley of California has always been treeless, and the Coast 
ranges south of 39° N. latitude, nearly so. 
Present Day Forest Areas.—The forests shown on this 
map are known as the original forests. If we were to travel 
westward from the site of Jamestown to-day, we should find 
only remnants of these forests located here and there. These 
133
-P-A-G-E-144
  134 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
remnants are on land that is generally not well suited for 
agriculture or that is distant from the large rivers or from 
railroads. On this trip only farm woodlands would be found 
until the mountains in the western portion of Virginia were 
reached. In what two forest areas is Virginia? From here

What part of the forests east of the grasslands is still standing? What part in the West? How many times larger was the original forest of the East than that of the West? 
into the hilly and mountainous portions of eastern Kentucky 
large tracts of woodlands would be seen. Beyond this we 
should find only small patches of woodlands until we reached 
the grasslands. Very little of the forests of the Rocky 
Mountains and the Sierra Nevadas have been removed. 
Until recently there has been no great demand for the wood 
of these mountain forests. ; 
Census data show that only about 470,600,000 acres of 
the original 822,000,000 of forests remain, and that we now
-P-A-G-E-145
  CONSERVATION OF OUR FOREST RESOURCES 135 
have only about two-fifths of the standing timber of the 
original forests. What has been done with the 352,000,000 
acres of forests (822,000,000 minus 470,000,000) ? It is esti- 
mated that 200,000,000 acres, an area equal to about eight 
States the size of Tennessee, have been cleared for agricul- 
ture. In clearing the land for farm crops, little attempt was 
made to save the wood of the forests, as you have read 
earlier in this book. To the farmer, trees were a hindrance 
to his farming operations. Clearing off the forest meant 
opening up the country to civilization. In this idea he was 
right. He had to have food, this demanded farm land, and, 
since the land was covered with forests, the trees had to be 
cut. He got rid of the trees in the easiest way possible. 
They were felled with the axe and saw, rolled into great log 
heaps, and burned. He could not sell the lumber, for all 
his neighbors had as much wood as he. 
Destruction of the Hardwood Forests.—The trees of the 
hardwood forest region were the ones chiefly sacrificed to 
make way for farms, because in much of this region the soil 
- was fertile, the rainfall sufficient for crops, and the growing 
season long enough for a great variety of farm products. 
Near-by portions of both the Northern and the Southern 
pine forests were also cleared for farms; but most of the pine 
lands of the eastern half of our country were untouched by 
the early farmers because they sought out the better lands 
first. 
The Beginning of Lumbering in America.—In time, as the 
timber became more scarce in the older-settled areas, the 
demand for lumber increased sufficiently to induce many 
men to go into the lumber business. Lumbering was active 
wherever there were waterways leading from the forest areas 
to the well-settled sections. It was then that the slaughter
-P-A-G-E-146
  136 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
of the pine forest began and has continued down to the pres- 
ent. Great sawmills were built where logs could be collected 
from large areas. At first most of the sawmills were located 
on rivers, thus making it possible to float the logs to the 
mills. When all the trees near the streams were cut off, and 
even back from them fifteen or twenty miles, railroads were 
built to reach the more distant forests. To-day some pine 
from the Northern area and much from the Southern forests 
is being shipped into the hardwood sections. Can you tell 
why? What are some of the uses of oak? of ash? of hick- 
ory? of chestnut? (See Chapter IX.) 
Wasteful Methods of Lumbering—Lumber men until 
recently were very wasteful of timber. They are not to be 
blamed, however, because, to make money, they had to put 
the lumber on the market as cheaply as possible. They, 
therefore, paid little or no attention to the practices that 
the best foresters recommend. What are some of these 
practices discussed in Chapter XIII? The lumber men 
were interested in getting out the best timber, and in 
most cases trees, too small for lumber, were destroyed or 
hurt. Good timber was often used for log ways and cor- 
duroy roads where poorer logs would have served as well. 
Logs were sometimes cut and left in the forest to decay 
and to become breeding-places for insects. Only the choic- 
est parts of the trees were taken. The tops and branches, 
which often contained much lumber, were left strewn over 
the ground to become fire traps, which after a season or 
two took fire as easily as a piece of kindling. 
There has been much improvement in most parts of our 
country in saving wood in lumbering, but still more care 
is needed. Trees are still being cut only for their bark, the 
logs being left to rot. .
-P-A-G-E-147
  
CONSERVATION OF OUR FOREST RESOURCES 137 
Needless Destruction of Trees.—We usually prize things 
of which we have the least. We treasure gold, diamonds, 
and precious stones (see page 9); yet iron and coal, water, 
and many other minerals are far more valuable and useful. 
Few people really prize trees. Many do not hesitate to cut, 
even when there is no call for cutting them, trees that have 
taken one hundred or even five hundred years to grow. 
When out camping, people will thoughtlessly build fires 
under valuable trees and scorch the branches. Some beau- 
tiful trees in our parks have been killed by pouring salt 
water from ice-cream freezers upon the ground beneath 
them. Many foolishly cut trees because they shade their 
houses or their lawns. You boys and girls, who really love 
trees and understand how valuable they are to us, must 
defend them against all such enemies. People must be made 
to feel that they have no right to harm a tree or, unless 
there is great need, to cut trees that nature has taken a 
century, perhaps many centuries, to grow. 
Americans Greatest Users of Wood.—Wood_ has in the 
past been so plentiful in our country that we have used it 
freely and wasted much needlessly. We, Americans, lead 
the world in the use of wood. We use 250 cubic feet per 
person annually, while the people of Europe use on the 
average only about 4o cubic feet. To meet our needs for 
wood of all sorts we are cutting every day in the year the 
timber from an area equal to a strip of land one mile wide 
and forty-three miles long. Because for so long wood has 
been plentiful and cheap, we have used it freely in mak- 
ing our houses, barns, and other buildings. In most Eu- 
ropean countries stone, cement, and brick are the chief 
building materials. Houses made of these materials have 
one great advantage over houses of wdod. They are less

likely to burn. In the number of fires and the loss by fires 
Americans again lead the world. The yearly fire loss in the 
United States is from $400,000,000 to $500,000,000. Much 
of this comes from the burning of wooden buildings. The 
wood used in replacing these houses must come from our

Fic. 60. An Area Devastated by Fire. 
The fire has not only killed the trees left after logging but has destroyed the forest floor 
(litter of leaves and twigs). The dense growth of weeds which is shown will tend to prevent 
young trees from getting a start. It will be many years before a young forest will again cover 
‘this area. 
forests. Thus each year our fire loss amounts to a sum suffi- 
cient to construct houses worth $4000 each for 100,000 peo- 
ple or more. Often the fires are started through carelessness. 
Destruction of Forests by Fires.—Besides being removed 
by farmers and lumbermen, thousands of square miles of the 
very finest of trees have been destroyed by forest fires. You 
have already been told how the lumbermen, by leaving brush
-P-A-G-E-149
  CONSERVATION OF OUR FOREST RESOURCES 139 
and logs in their logging operations, make fire traps. Light- 
ning, sparks from passing locomotives, matches, and cigar 
and cigarette stubs of careless hunters or lumberjacks, or 
fires of careless campers, or of farmers clearing land, all give 
rise to terrible forest fires, that destroy human life and 
buildings, kill birds and game animals, as well as trees. In 
1924 the loss of wood by forest fires in the State of Ten- 
nessee alone was nearly $500,000. All men and women who 
think about the future of our country and the needs of the 
next generations can readily see that something must be 
done to conserve our timber resources. 
Removal of Forests.—It may seem to some that we have 
not been using up our forests very rapidly when we cut off 
only 352,000,000 acres in about three hundred years. But 
one must consider that nearly all this removal has been done 
within the last hundred years. Figure 59 shows the original 
area of the forest lands in the East and in the West and the 
present areas. Study this diagram and tell your. teacher 
what it says. We are now cutting forests at the rate of 10,- 
000,000 acresa year. This is forty-three square miles a day. 
How long will the 470,000,000 acres last at that rate? Ex- 
pert foresters believe that by the close of the next forty-five 
or fifty years we shall have cut off all of the original forests ! 
Plainly something must be done or those who follow us will 
have very little wood to meet their needs. 
Does this mean that we cannot use wood? No, indeed. 
That is not the idea of conservation of our forest resources. 
We have a right to use all we need; but our children and 
grandchildren will blame us if we use the forest resources 
wastefully without considering them. ~—— 
Several Ways of Conserving Our Forest Resources.— 
There are several things we can do and do now. We should
-P-A-G-E-150
| 140 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
study and think of these suggestions carefully, for each of 
us must do his share in the work of conservation. 
1. We should replant forests on all lands that have been 
cleared but that are not needed or.are not suitable for the 
growing of crops. All slopes that cannot be prevented from 
gullying, should be planted in trees. In Chapter XII you 
will study about the reclamation of washed and gullied 
lands. On almost any farm in many parts of our country : 
one will find lands of 1, 2, 10, 20, or more acres that should | 
be reforested. 7 
Some of our large lumber companies are reforesting their 
cut-over lands, and others would do so if reforesting could 
be done without their losing money. What we need in most 
states are laws that will not tax as heavily as farming 
lands and other property, lands growing timber trees. It 
takes from forty to fifty years to grow oak trees large 
enough for railroad ties and longer for timbers or boards. 
Unless the taxes are very icw no one can afford to do this. 
Farmers would be encouraged aiso to replant if they could 
be exempt from paying taxes, or if their taxes were lowered 
on lands planted in trees. 
2. Lands now in forest not suitable for the growing of 
crops should. be kept in trees and lumbered off as the na- 
tional or state forests are. Chapter VIII tells just how this 
may be done. How long would a forest last if it were lum- 
bered in this way ? 
3. Forest fires should be prevented if possible. Study the 
causes of fires, as given above, and make some suggestions 
as to how they may be checked. 
4. We should reduce waste wherever possible: 
(a) There are many ways in which improvements may be 
made in lumbering. In felling trees care must be taken to 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
CONSERVATION OF OUR FOREST RESOURCES I41 
harm as few small trees as possible. If feasible, all logs not 
suitable for lumber, the tops of the trees, and larger branches 
should be used in some way. Wood for fuel may be cut from 
the tops and larger branches. 
(6) In the sawmill there és a loss of lumber in sawdust, 
thin slabs, and edgings. 
This cannot be avoided. 
In most mills, as you 
learned in Chapter X, 
these may be used for 
fuel in making steam. 
The real waste comes 
when no use is made of 
this fuel in the mill or 
elsewhere. Lath and 
other small pieces of 
lumber may be made 
from the thicker slabs. 
Wherever possible, 
mills should have 
machinery for using the thicker slabs. 
(c) There is also great waste in planing lumber, in making 
flooring, moulding, siding, doors, windows, and furniture. 
In some mills, no doubt, a saving in wood may be made. In 
most of these operations, however, it is probable that the 
waste is as little as possible, since the lumber used is expen- 
sive. Many wooden articles could be made from the small 
pieces that are refuse in furniture factories, but the cost of 
putting in machinery to use them would in most cases be so 
great that it would not pay the factory owner. The use of 
veneer and the gluing together of narrow strips to make 
wide boards are all attempts to save lumber.     Courtesy of U. S. Forest Service. 
Fic. 61. High Stumps. 
Much good lumber is left in each stump.
-P-A-G-E-152
142 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
(d) Another waste that can very readily be reduced—in 
fact, more easily than any of the above, except the waste 
by fires—is the loss by decay. The life of any wood may 
be greatly lengthened by painting or creosoting. 
“ Most people think 
that we paint houses 
merely to make them 
look better. We should 
paint houses to make 
the wood last longer. 
Every exposed part 
should be painted, 
whether the ‘part is to 
be seen or not. Paint 
is really a mineral. 
When we paint, there- 
fore, we cover the sur- 
face with a mineral that 
is held to the wood by 
linseed oil. This mineral     Courtesy of U.S. Forest Service. 
Fic. 62. A Simple and Easy Way of 
Creosoting Fence Posts. 
Can you describe how it is done? How are rail- covering and the dried road ties creosoted by the larger railroads? What |, i is the value of creosoting? linseed oil keep out 
water anddecay. Most 
woods used for fence posts, telegraph poles, timbers, rail- 
road ties, etc., that are exposed to the weather, should be 
creosoted. Painting of such rough lumber would be expen- 
sive. 
Creosote is a better protection to wood than paint, 
although it does not look so well. Railroad ties untreated 
with creosote will last seven or eight years in the ground, 
but if well creosoted will probably last fifteen or more years. 
It takes from 100,000,000 to 125,000,000 ties to supply our
-P-A-G-E-153
CONSERVATION OF OUR FOREST RESOURCES 143 
railroads annually. Some of these are creosoted, but most 
of them are not. If all were creosoted the ties needed each 
year would be greatly reduced. Some think that, if all ties 
were creosoted, the number needed each year would be 
reduced to 75,000,000 or even 50,000,000. Fig. 62 shows a 
simple method of creosoting fence posts. 
Many of the larger railroads of the country have great 
creosoting plants where they treat hundreds of ties a day. 
The ties are piled on small cars, which are run into great 
cylinders, some 140 or 150 feet long. The door is closed air- 
tight and hot creosote under great pressure is forced into 
the cylinder and thus into the ties nearly to the centre. 
5. There are many substitutes for wood which, if used, 
would conserve timber. Brick, stone, and cement are more 
durable than wood in buildings. Steel bridges, if kept well 
_ painted, are stronger and cheaper in the long run than 
wooden bridges; besides they do not catch on fire. Cement 
or iron fence posts for wire fences are common in some parts 
of our country. Cement telephone poles are sometimes 
used. Cement should be used for walks, and wire or stone 
for fences. Railroad cars and vessels should be made of 
steel instead of wood. See if you can think of any other 
ways in which wood may be replaced. Railroad ties of wood 
will continue to be used, for no other material is quite suit- 
able. There is a “give” to wood that makes the cars run 
smoothly. Steel is sometimes used in furniture. Steel 
library shelving, steel filing cases, and steel beds are com- 
mon, but most people prefer furniture of wood. 
6. Still another way to conserve wood is to reduce the 
number of fires that destroy buildings and furniture. Open 
fireplaces in the home should have wire screens before them. 
The chimneys should be inspected regularly. We should be  
-P-A-G-E-154
  144 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
very careful in using kerosene, and particularly gasoline, 
about the home. Matches should never be strewn about. 
They should be kept in tin boxes. To place a lighted candle 
on a Christmas-tree is always to invite fire. One fire in 
North Carolina, one Christmas recently, set by lighted 
candles, caused the loss of a church, all the presents on the 
tree, and, far worse, more than fifty persons, most of whom 
were small children. Surely no one would be so foolish as to 
put a lighted candle on a cedar tree that burns with a roar 
when once ignited. 
7. Lastly, we should always try to use the right wood in 
the right place. InChapter IX you have learned the various 
uses to which the different woods are put. The national 
Government has a very serviceable laboratory at Madison, 
Wisconsin, called the Forest Products Laboratory. In this 
laboratory tests and experiments are made to determine the 
best uses of the different woods. The experts working in 
this laboratory try to find out new uses for wood and how - 
best to check the waste in using wood. Can you imagine any 
establishment rendering a greater service in the conserva- 
tion of our forest resources? 
Part II 
THE FOREST CONSERVATION WORK OF ONE 
LUMBER COMPANY IN THE SOUTH 
The Dependence on Forests.—Here and there in every 
forested section of our country there are lumber companies 
that are trying to save wood wherever possible. But cer- 
tainly none follows the best forestry practices more nearly 
than one great lumber company with whose work the
-P-A-G-E-155
  
CONSERVATION OF OUR FOREST: RESOURCES 145 
authors are acquainted. This company is one of the largest 
in the South. Its great mills are located in a small city in 
Louisiana. As in most lumber towns nearly every one in 
this city is in one way or another connected with the making 
of forest products—lumber, shingles, lath, pulp, paper, and 
others. Nearly everybody, therefore—certainly each of the 
three thousand or four thousand workmen and every mem- 
ber of their families, and, of course the company itself—is 
interested in the supply of timber that is within reach of the 
mills of this city. Should the supply give out hundreds of 
homes, the schoolhouses, stores, churches, and the mills also 
would have to be abandoned, unless other industries not de- 
pendent on the forests came in. 
Methods of Fire Protection.—One of the major interests 
of the company, therefore, is the protection of its timber 
supply from fires. The protection of the supply is also of 
interest to the people in general in the State of Louisiana, 
for should the forests be destroyed by fire their lumber 
would be more expensive. 
With some assistance from the company the State has 
provided every device and uses every method that you have 
learned about for controlling forest fires. There is a forest 
ranger with several patrolmen (half of the salaries of these 
is paid by the company), and fire-fighting crews. The latter 
have been organized by the company from among its work- 
men. Tall observation towers (there are few hills in the 
region) enable the watchmen, who are on duty every hour in 
the day all during the season when fires are likely to occur, 
to see a large part of the forest. Telephones connect the 
towns with the homes of the patrolmen and also with the 
main office of the company. All through the forest, at con- 
venient locations, fire-fighting tools are stored, and more  
-P-A-G-E-156
  146 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
than 240 miles of fire lanes are kept in good condition to 
prevent the spread of fires should they get a start. More 
than 200,000 acres, some owned by farmers but mostly by 
the company, are protected in this way. As long as the com- 
pany and the state are as vigilant as they are in controlling 
fires, thereis little danger of destruction of the timber supply. 
Co-operation of Farmers Sought.—The company realizes 
that it needs the co-operation of all landowners of the 
near-by region, for, should fires get started in the forests 
near-by, they might spread to those owned by the company, 
and so it has joined with the forest services of the state in 
educating the people to the value of timber and as to meth- 
ods of preventing fires. Lecturers are sent out who give 
illustrated talks and large-sized advertisements are carried 
in newspapers and journals published in the state. In one 
year 15,000 pamphlets and books were given away. In 
spite of all this expense and trouble, many people refuse to 
be educated in forest conservation, yet most of the farmers 
and lumber companies are coming to see the need of pro- 
tecting forests from fire. 
A Continuous Supply of Timber Provided.—To keep the 
great mills in operation of course requires a vast number of 
logs, and: thus the forests are being rapidly cut off. The 
mills in this city cut about a million board feet of lumber 
every day, when running twenty-four hours, as they gener- 
ally do. If this company were like most lumber com- 
panies, it would be an easy matter for you to calculate 
just how long these mills would continue to run. All one 
would need to know is how many acres of forests there are 
and how many acres are cut off each year. But this com- 
pany does not intend to go out of business very soon on 
account of a shortage of logs.
-P-A-G-E-157
  CONSERVATION OF OUR FOREST RESOURCES 147 
To insure a continuous supply of timber the company has 
in late years been actively engaged in reforestation. It has 
planted more than 10,000,000 trees and has plans to plant 
78,000 acres of “‘cut-over” land with 800 trees to the acre. 
How many trees will it take to plant this large area? Figure 
69 shows a part of a nursery field which contains 7,000,000 
young trees that have grown from seed. These will be set 
out during the next year or two. Within fifteen years the 
trees will grow to be large enough for pulp wood and in 
twenty-five years will be large enough for the sawmill. 
Forests grow very rapidly in the South, more rapidly than 
in many other parts of our country unless it is in western. 
Washington and Oregon. This is due to the heavy rainfall 
and long, warm growing season. Would you not like to 
see some of these 7,000,000 young trees when they have 
grown to be large trees: of commercial value? The boys 
and girls of many schools of Louisiana have their own 
school nurseries and plant trees every year. 
How Louisiana Laws Aid Reforestation.—The reforesta- 
tion work of the company is greatly aided by the laws of the 
State of Louisiana. These laws have been made to encourage 
the farmers and lumbermen of the state to plant trees on 
“cut-over’’ land not well suited for the growing of crops. 
Any one wishing to plant trees, with the idea of growing 
commercial timber, makes application to the proper officials 
in the county (in Louisiana the term parish is used) and 
enters into a contract with the county (parish) and the state. 
The applicant is assured that no tax will be levied on his 
growing timber until the timber is cut and offered for sale. 
The land on which the trees are grown is taxed, but not the 
growing forest. The land tax is so low that the farmers and 
lumber companies are not forced to cut the timber that
-P-A-G-E-158
    
148 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
grows on it to reduce their taxes or to get money to pay their 
taxes. The state also aids in keeping fires out of the grow- 
ing timber. All states should have laws as excellent as is this 
one in Louisiana. 
How Refuse Is Disposed of at Most Mills.——You have 
learned earlier in this chapter that there is great waste of 
lumber in the sawmills in the form of sawdust, slabs, and 
edgings. In most sawmills some of this waste is used in 
making steam, but not all of the edgings and slabs can be 
used in this way, so they are dumped into great refuse burn- 
ers. Here the fires, that burn for years, devour everything. 
Wood burned in the refuse burners is entirely wasted, of 
course. The great refuse burner of this company was in 
constant use for sixteen years; hardly during all that time 
did the fires go out. Every day it burned up 560 cords 
of wood, and in the sixteen years it consumed 2,688,000 
cords. Is this not a terrible waste? 
Making of Paper from Waste.—The company after a time 
came to realize that it was, and so it erected a great paper 
mill at great cost, and began to make paper of the slabs and 
edgings that formerly went up in smoke. In a recent letter 
to the authors the manager of the company wrote as fol- 
lows: ‘‘At our paper mill we manufacture 100 tons of pulp 
per day, 130 tons of container liner, which is used in corru- 
gated shipping-cases, and 55 tons of Kraft wrapping paper 
of the highest quality. This is just a start, as we are using 
only a part of our logging waste, and in a short time we ex- 
pect to make a considerable addition to our paper mill prop- 
erty.” One can realize how anxious the company is to con- 
serve the forest resources when he learns that the great 
paper mill which uses up this refuse cost many millions of 
dollars. It is paying the company well, however, in spite
-P-A-G-E-159
  CONSERVATION OF OUR FOREST RESOURCES 149 
of the great cost of the paper mill, but it is also paying the 
people of Louisiana and every one in our country who uses 
paper. 
Other Plants.—This company also has a creosoting plant 
where paving blocks and other articles of wood that are to 
be used where decay is rapid are treated in great quantities. 
A box factory, a turpentine plant, and a veneer mill are 
owned wholly or partially by this company, and all co- 
operate to reduce waste to the minimum. 
Do you not, as a lover of trees and the forest and as a citi- 
zen of the United States who wants to have all our re- 
sources conserved, wish that all large lumber companies 
would try to conserve our forest resources as well as this 
great company does?

  CHAPTER XII 
RECLAMATION OF WASTE LANDS 
Description and History of Waste Lands.—We have been 
studying about trees and forests almost all the way through 
this book. Now we are going to give our attention to some 
parts of the United States where the appearance of the land 
is very different from the forest-covered tracts or from areas 
decorated with trees. Fortunately the lands that we are go- 
ing to talk about now are not seen everywhere. There are 
enough of them, however, to cause people who love the 
United States a great deal of anxiety and the people who 
own such lands much loss. 
Dense stands of wheat, alfalfa, clover, and rice are beauti- 
ful to look upon and rich fields of green corn, potatoes, and 
cotton make us glad. In fact well tilled tracts of any kind 
are a joy to behold. But what can we say when we pass 
through lands gashed with gullies, worn out, and lying waste 
from poor handling? The story of these waste lands is a very 
sad one. We wonder what they would tell us ifthey could 
speak. Many once were the resting places of magnificent 
trees and were playgrounds for birds, squirrels, and other 
wild animals. 
Years and years ago men came to these forests and prob- 
ably admired them, and decided to build their homes near 
them because of their beauty. Now these men were not 
wicked men. They wanted to make a living for their fami- 
lies. They knew they must clear some of their forests away 
to make room for cultivating crops and this they proceeded 
150
-P-A-G-E-161
  RECLAMATION OF WASTE LANDS I5t 
to do even on steep slopes. After they had grown crops of 
corn, wheat, oats, or whatever else they needed, for a num- 
ber of years, some misfortune seemed to be coming to the 
land. At first the crops they raised were abundant, but 
  
  
  Fic. 63. A Large Gully Before Work Began. 
gradually they began to get smaller and smaller, and these 
lands being on the sides of hills little seams or gashes began 
to appear, running up and down the slopes. The crops be- 
gan to get smaller, because they had, year by year, taken up 
into themselves plant food that good soil holds, and little 
or no plant food had been returned to the soil to keep it 
® fertile; and because much of the rich top dirt had been 
washed away. On these hillsides another complication 
came in. Such lands now began to wash away almost in 
floods, through the little seams or gashes mentioned above. 
These seams grew larger and larger with every rain until, 
after a time, they became so deep that teams could not
-P-A-G-E-162
  152 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
cross them. The farmers sometimes laid off their cotton or 
corn rows or ploughed their furrows for other crops up and 
down the hills instead of on a level around the face of the 
slopes. This practice increased the number of gullies, for 
the rainfall had little seams ready-made down which the 
water could easily run and carry off the top soil, causing 
deep ravines. Such lands, through the years, have now be- 
come mere eyesores, unable to grow crops and harmful to 
bottom lands which they cover with the dirt and rock they 
are forever dumping. People who own these waste lands ~ 
receive nothing from them. They cannot raise crops on 
such areas and their property is hurt by the run-down ap- 
pearance of the land. The owners also have to pay taxes on 
them. Altogether these poor old worn-out lands area burden 
to themselves and to every one else. 
Method of Reclamation.—Now, State Forestry Depart- 
ments have put on projects in restoring these waste lands 
to use again. There may be some small differences in 
handling the reclamation projects, but in general the 
methods are very similar. 
First, a forester goes out to these lands and studies them 
very carefully. Usually, he decides to restore the worst 
looking areas he can find and those located on the highways 
or on some conspicuous spot where many people can see how 
the work is carried on and can go back to their own lands 
and start the same thing there. 
After the forester has selected a very badly scarred 
piece of worthless land he makes arrangements with the 
man who owns the property to meet him there some time in 
the spring or fall of the year. The landowner brings his 
teams and mules and as many men as he possibly can to 
conduct the work. 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
RECLAMATION OF WASTE, LANDS 153 
We will imagine it a bright, sunshiny day when the land- 
owner and his men with wagons and some one a forester all 
meet to do as heavy a piece of work as most men care to 
tackle. The forester tells the men to get together as much 
old brush, tree trunks, and trash as they can find. They 
  
    
Fic. 64. Building Brush Dams. 
work hard and fast for several days, driving their teams very 
rapidly, so the forester can move on to another project as 
soon as possible. Sometimes on a good-sized area as many 
as forty men and ten teams are used. Now as these tree 
tops, old trunks of trees, and brush are gathered, they are 
wedged into these great gashes up and down the hillsides. 
They are built in such a way as to form a regular network 
and arranged to hold so tight in the gullies that when the 
rains come and the floods dash down through these gullies 
the network of branches will hold securely and not float 
away. After these temporary dams, as they are called, are 
finished, the area is allowed to rest.  
-P-A-G-E-164
154 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
Now, then, a very interesting thing happens. The rains 
of fall and winter come as usual. The water pours down the 
hillsides muddy and full of the valuable dirt it is stealing 
away from the beautiful hills, when suddenly into these 
brush dams it tumbles. The brush dams then hold firmly 
  
  Fic. 65. Ploughing to Give Dirt to Stream. 
After the brush dams have been partly covered by dirt carried by the water. The banks have been ploughed off to furnish dirt for the running water. 
and catch the dirt that the water was bearing away. As 
week after week passes and rains occur, more and more soil 
is caught in these brush dams and, gradually, the gullies 
begin to fill up with dirt. 
But this is only part of the work of reclamation. In a 
few months the forester comes again to the landowner. He 
looks over the project, as he calls it, and tells his friend that 
it is all doing very nicely; that plenty of dirt is now caught 
in the gullies and that it is time to do some planting. So 
now they start in to make what they call a permanent dam.
-P-A-G-E-165
    
RECLAMATION OF WASTE LANDS 155 
This is to be of living trees. They plant seedlings, of the 
black locust tree in certain localities. They choose this tree 
because it grows very fast, because also young trees come up 
as sprouts from the old trees and because it spreads through 
the ground rapidly and forms a perfect network of inter-. 
  
   
     
Fic. 66. A Gully Four Years After Reclamation. 
lacing roots which help to hold dirt. This tree furnishes ex- 
cellent fence posts, so in ten or fifteen years the landowner 
can begin to cut down some of the trees and use them on his 
own farm or sell them on the market. 
Success of Reclamation.—After the forester has helped 
the landowner to plant the locust seedlings he again goes 
away, leaving directions as to just the right way to care for 
and protect the young locusts so they will grow their best. 
From time to time the forester revisits the gullied area un- 
til, after some years, on returning, he looks over the hill- 
side and lo and behold, instead of seeing barren slopes with
-P-A-G-E-166
errant 
156 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
gashes all up and down them, he sees beautiful trees with 
tall slender trunks carrying a lacy canopy of delicate green 
leaves. He cannot find the gashes at all, and underneath 
the trees often blue grass is seen. 
Again the trees are covering the hillsides, the rains fall, 
but the floods do not come dashing down the slopes, the 
water is held by the leaf litter, weeds, grass, and roots, and 
sinks into the ground. No longer is the bottom land being 
covered with gravel and rock from these once-gullied slopes. 
‘The farmer thus learns not to clear off hills too steep for cul- 
tivation. The landowner is content because he knows that 
his farm is far more valuable than before. 
Dynamiting Expensive.—Sometimes dynamiting of the 
hillsides is done at the very beginning of these projects to 
secure quickly a sufficient amount of loose soil and to round 
off the gully banks at once for setting the black locust tree 
seedlings, but this process is expensive and is used more in- 
frequently than the brush dam method.

CHAPTER XIII 
SCHOOL PLANTING 
Forestry belongs to every one. Even the smallest child 
can help to some extent in the big work that America has 
before her; namely, the proper care of and replacement of 
trees. How are we as boys and girls still in school to share 
in the effort? Think what it would mean if every child in 
the United States would plant and protect just one tree! 
It might be interesting to find out how many children 
there are going to school in our country, and then we would 
know about the number of trees that they would set out.

most probably is. 
1. In many schools 
a seedbed or nursery can

be planted by the chil- 
dren by securing from 
some public-spirited citi- 
zen a suitable plot of ground, say of three or four acres, 
in which seedlings can be transplanted. 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR PLANTING 
Preparation of Seedbed 
1. Make a seedbed in the school yard on a plot of 
ground four or five feet wide by six or eight feet long. 
Throw the dirt up higher in this plot than the surround- 
ing ground. Box the bed in with plank or boards, if de- 
sired. Use any kind of loose, rich soil. 
2. Make a seedbox about twelve to fourteen inches
-P-A-G-E-169

wide by eighteen to twenty-four inches long for the school- 
room. Use any kind of loose, rich soil. 
Seed Planting 
1. Make little furrows or drills eight or ten inches apart 
in the seedbed or closer in the box.

2. Sprinkle the seed (if light, like pine, poplar, ash, etc.) 
in these drills about one-fourth to one-half inch apart and 
cover lightly with dirt one-fourth to one-half inch deep. 
3. Plant the seed (if heavy like acorns, hickory nuts, and 
walnuts) two or three inches apart and cover lightly with 
dirt one-half inch deep. 
4. Keep the ground moist, and, if necessary, partly shade 
the growths to keep them from getting too dry while they 
are very young.
-P-A-G-E-170
160 OUR TRELS AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
5. Make a record of each row of seedlings the first year, 
stating the date of planting the seed, and the species. 
Transplanting 
1. Lift the seedlings out of the bed or box when one 
year old. Set them in the school grounds, if there is space, 
one foot apart in rows two feet apart, in loose, rich soil. 
2. Cultivate these to keep the weeds out. 
3. Transplant the seedlings when two or three years old, 
or older, if so desired, in the permanent school forest or in 
the town around the school or around the children’s homes. 
Instructions for Observation 
1. Notice and tabulate the appearance of the first leaves 
that come out. 
2. Notice how the second leaves differ from the first and 
tabulate what is seen. 
3. Observe and describe the appearance of the bark on 
tender young shoots. 
4. Observe and note when the growing season stops. 
This occurs variously; in some trees it stops in June, in 
some in July, and in others even in August. Tabulate this. 
5. Observe the little bud at the top of the stem which 
forms at the end of the growing season. This little bud is 
the starting point of the growth for the next year. Below 
this bud the stem never gets any longer. 
In general, trees are divided into two kinds, one called 
evergreens, because they retain their green foliage the 
whole year round; the other known as deciduous, because 
they shed their leaves in the fall. Evergreens, as a rule, are 
suitable for parks, lawns, and school grounds. Many de-

  CHAPTER XIV 
ARBOR DAY 
1 
History or Arpor Day 
Definition of Arbor Day.—Arbor Day means tree day, a 
time chosen for planting trees and commemorating them by 
suitable exercises. 
First State to Have Celebration.—On first thoughtit might 
seem strange that this celebration did not have its beginning 
in some of the earlier-settled states like Massachusetts, 
Virginia, or New York, but instead Nebraska has that 
honor. Here trees were very scarce. So far as we know, 
there never were many trees in that section, and certainly 
there was no great abundance of them when Arbor Day was 
established. Most of the people in Nebraska in the early 
days had come from the forested lands to the east and to 
them the country looked bare and lonesome. The citizens 
wanted more woods for service and for beauty. They real- 
ized that they could secure them readily and surely by plant- 
ing them, so they chose and named a special day for this, to 
be observed all over their state, and named it Arbor Day. 
This was away back in 1872 not long after ah: Civil War. 
(How long ago is that ?) 
Now, since they wanted everybody in their section to be 
interested in Arbor Day and to make it a great success for 
the good of all, they wrote about it in newspapers and made 
165 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  166 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
speeches calling upon the public to co-operate in this move- 
ment of tree planting. Prizes even were offered to encourage 
the setting out of many stands of timber. 
Number of Trees Planted.—The result of this was that 
1,000,000 trees were planted in Nebraska that first Arbor 
Day. What great love and care these Middle-Western 
people showed! Can we not imagine them, both town and 
country folk, gathering in groups or singly each doing his 
share in the development of his State through the planting 
of trees. 
These people had set out trees before this time, for they 
had been greatly concerned over the situation, but their 
efforts had not as yet brought results. From now on, how- 
ever, the work of forestation was active, and increased as the 
years went on. Since then many, many more millions of 
trees have been planted in that State, until now there are 
about 1,000,000,000. As we noted in our chapter on natural 
and artificial forests, there are many artificial forests in 
America. Nebraska probably leads in this regard. To-day 
there are over 700,000 acres of these within her borders 
which her citizens have planted. What a wonderful story 
this is! We can hardly imagine what 1,000,000,000 trees 
would look like, and surely it would take us days to travel 
over 700,000 acres of land. Those old Nebraskan citizens 
who accomplished this great work for their State and for 
America should never be forgotten. 
Purpose of Arbor Day.—At first the purpose of Arbor Day 
was to establish woodlands, particularly for windbreaks, 
fuel, and fence posts. Gradually, in many places, other ideas 
developed in connection with it—for instance, trees are set 
out now for shade and also to serve as memorials. All of us 
know what we mean by shade trees, but some few may not
-P-A-G-E-177
  ARBOR DAY 167 
understand about memorials. The idea of these is to plant a 
tree or group of trees in honor of some person—for example, 
in honor of a soldier who lost his life helping America during 
the World War. These monuments of living trees, unlike 
those of lifeless stone, express the gratitude of the people of 
our great country to our fallen heroes, and, at the same time, 
make our land more beautiful and more prosperous. Some- 
times these memorial trees are planted and named in honor 
or memory of some distinguished citizen who has died, but 
who had lived a life of such usefulness to his fellow men that 
his deeds and character are deserving of being kept ever in 
their thoughts. 
In 1875 Kansas and Tennessee followed Nebraska’s lead 
and inaugurated Arbor Day. Soon Minnesota joined the 
ranks, and then Cincinnati, Ohio, had an enormous festival 
with 20,000 school-children co-operating. There was a 
public parade through the city streets, very inspiring to see, 
and exercises of singing and reciting by the children in Eden 
Park, where dirt was thrown around trees that had been 
already set. Gradually the custom of observing the day 
spread over the United States until now it is an annual fes- 
tival in most of the schools of our great land. In many 
localities the exercises include the honoring of birds as well 
as trees. 
Different Times for Celebration.—Arbor Day is observed 
in many other countries in the world besides the United 
States. It takes place at different times of the year accord- 
ing to the climate of the locality in which the celebration is 
held. Most of the states have theirs before the growing sea- 
son begins, which is in the spring. Therefore in Florida, 
where it is warm, February is the date; while in Massachu- 
setts, a more northerly and colder region, the last of April is  
-P-A-G-E-178
    168 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
none too warm. In certain states a definite time fixed by 
law has been adopted for the celebration, in others it takes 
place according to the proclamation of the governors of 
those states or in connection with other holidays. Spring is 
the beginning of the growing season; the sap then rises and 
it is more difficult to make trees live when transplanted at 
that time; therefore, if Arbor Day is fixed by law in any 
locality so late that the sap is rising in the trees, then it will 
be necessary to plant the trees much earlier than that day 
in order to have successful results. The exercises in honor 
of the planting, however, can be carried out at the regularly 
approved time. : 
Occasionally, the weather permitting, a trip into near-by 
woods might be taken, a study of the*forest trees made, 
lunch eaten, and the exercises conducted in the open. We 
must remember always that the festival has deep meaning. 
In it we are thinking of our country, how we must work for 
her present prosperity and for future generations. If we 
are planting trees as memorials, we are remembering the 
great men and women who have helped to build America in 
the past, and are hoping to grow like them in the future. If 
our ceremony includes trees and birds, we are paying respect 
to two of the greatest of man’s friends in nature, and we are 
actually contributing to the good of our school, our town, 
and our country. Can we not have a splendid tree planting 
and festival in our community or town each year?

POEMS ON TREES AND FORESTS 
WHAT DO WE PLANT?.- 
What do we plant when we plant the tree? 
We plant the ship, which will cross the sea. 
We plant the mast to carry the sails; 
We plant the planks to withstand the gales— 
The keel, the keelson and beam and knee: 
We plant the ship when we plant the tree. 
What do we plant when we plant the tree? 
We plant the house for you and me. 
We plant the rafters, the shingles, the floors, 
We plant the studding, the laths, the doors, 
The beam and siding, all parts that be: 
We plant the house when we plant the tree. 
What do we plant when we plant the tree? 
A thousand things that we daily see; 
We plant the spire that out-towers the crag, 
We plant the staff for our country’s flag, 
We plant the shade, from the hot sun free: 
We plant all these when we plant the tree. 
—HENRY ABBEY. 
THE FIRE FIGHTERS . 
“Where’s Smith and Hennessy, Edwards, Stowe— 
Where’s Casey and Link and Small?” 
The ranger listened and murmured low: 
“They’re missing, Chief, that’s all. 
“Where the smoke rolls high, I saw them ride— 
They waved good-bye to me;

174 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
Good God! they might as well have tried 
To put back the rolling sea. 
“T rode for aid till my horse fell dead, 
Then waded the mountain stream; 
The pools I swam were red, blood red, 
And covered with choking steam. 
“There was never a comrade to shout ‘Hello,’ 
Though I flung back many a call; 
The brave boys knew what it meant to go— 
They’re missing, Chief, that’s all.”’ 
—ARTHUR CHAPMAN. 
THE BROWN THRUSH 
There’s a merry brown thrush sitting up in the tree, 
He’s singing to me! He’s singing to me! 
And what does he say, little girl, little boy ? 
“Qh, the world’s running over with joy! 
Don’t you hear? Don’t you see? 
Hush. Look! In my tree 
I’m as happy as happy can be!” 
And the brown thrush keeps singing, “A nest do you see, 
And five eggs, hid by me in the juniper tree? 
Don’t meddle! Don’t touch! Little girl, little boy, 
Or the world will lose some of its joy ! 
Now Iam glad! Now I’m free! 
And I always shall be, 
If you never bring sorrow to me.” 
So the merry brown thrush sings away in the tree, 
To you and to me, to you and to me; 
And he sings all the day, little girl, ittle boy, 
“Oh, the world’s running over with joy ! 
But long it won’t be,

Don’t you know? Don’t you see? 
Unless we’re as good as can be?”’ 
SALUTE TO THE TREES 
Many a tree is found in the wood 
And every tree for its use is good; 
Some for the strength of the gnarled root, 
Some for the sweetness of flower or fruit; 
Some for shelter against the storm, 
And some to keep the hearthstone warm; 
Some for the roof and some for the beam, 
And some for a boat to breast the stream— 
In the wealth of the wood since the world began 
The trees have offered their gifts to man. 
But the glory of trees is more than their gifts; 
’Tis a beautiful wonder of life that lifts, 
From a wrinkled seed in an earth-bound clod, 
A column, an arch in the temple of God, 
A pillar of power, a dome of delight, 
A shrine of song, and a joy of sight ! 
Their roots are the nurses of rivers in birth; 
Their leaves are alive with the breath of the earth; 
They shelter the dwellings of man; and they bend 
O’er his grave with the look of a loving friend. 
I have camped in the whispering forest of pines, 
I have slept in the shadow of olives and vines; 
In the knees of an oak, at the foot of a palm 
I have found good rest and slumber’s balm. 
And now, when the morning gilds the boughs 
Of the vaulted elm at the door of my house, 
I open the window and make salute; 
“God bless thy branches and feed thy root ! 
Thou hast lived before, live after me, 
Thou ancient, friendly, faithful tree.” 
——HENRY VAN DYKE.  
-P-A-G-E-186
  176 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
TREES 
Trees are alive, as I am, and they, like me, must die; 
But daily their roots go deeper, and their proud heads nearer 
the sky; 
The storms that buffet and dare them but set them sturdier 
still; 
Trees, will you make me your comrade, and your dauntless will 
my will? 
  There was a man who, mourning, went out to Gethsemane; 
He sought the arms of his father; he found the arms of a tree; 
And the green, old, comforting olive that tenderly bent above 
Gave back his faltering courage and strengthened his heart with 
love. 
Trees are alive, as I am; and they, like me, must die, 
And give back the dust of their bodies to the green earth where 
they lie; z 
But their staunch, brave life shall fail not, if justice is ever 
done, 
And if there is Life Eternal, the trees and I shall be one. 
—KATHARINE A. GRIMES. 
THE RIVER’S VINDICATION 
It’s true I’ve gone on the warpath, 
I’ve smitten your cities and homes, 
I’ve cracked the walls of your stately halls, 
I’ve threatened your spires and domes. 
I’ve spoiled your gardens and orchards, 
I’ve carried your bridges away, 
The loss is told in millions of gold; 
The indemnity you must pay. 
But had I not cause for anger? 
Was it not time to rebel ?
-P-A-G-E-187
  POEMS ON TREES AND FORESTS 177 
Go, ask of the springs that feed me; 
Their rock-ribbed heights can tell. 
Go to my mountain cradle, 
Go to my home and see, 
Look on my ruined forests 
And note what ye did to me. 
These were my sylvan bowers, 
My beds of bracken and fern, 
The spots where I lie and rest me 
E’er to your valleys I turn. 
These you have plundered and wasted, 
You’ve chopped and burned and scarred, 
Till my home is left of verdure bereft, 
Bare and lifeless and charred. 
So I have gone on the warpath; 
I’ve harried your lands with glee. 
Restore with care my woodlands fair 
And T’ll peacefully flow to the sea. 
—F. W. NASH. 
WHAT DO WE BURN, WHEN WE BURN 
OUR TREES? 
What do we burn when we burn a tree? 
We burn the home for you and me, 
We burn the carriage house, barn, and shed, 
The baby’s cradle, the little boy’s sled, 
The hookcase, the table, the rocker of ease, 
We burn all these when we burn our trees. 
What do we burn when we burn our trees? 
The daily comfort which every one sees, 
The wages for man for years to come, 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
178 OUR TREES AND HOW THEY SERVE US 
In factories big where busy wheels hum— 
For industries many depend on trees— 
When our forests burn we burn all these. 
What do we burn when we burn our trees? 
The homes of the birds, the squirrels, and bees, 
The home of the brook and the cooling spring 
Where violets blossom and bluebirds sing, 
The beauties of nature, so fair to please— 
We burn all these when we burn our trees. 
Summer or winter, day or night, 
The woods are an ever new delight; 
They give us peace, and they make us strong, 
Such wonderful balms to them belong.

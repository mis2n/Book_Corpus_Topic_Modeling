STATE OF TENNESSEE—DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 
To His Excellency, Tom C. Rye, Governor of Tennessee: 
Dear Sir: In compliance with Section 7, Chapter 25, of 
the Acts of 1873, I herewith submit the biennial report of the 
Department of Education for two years ending June 30, 1916. 
A Recorp Fuit or ENcouraAGEMENT. 
The general summaries found in this report show conclu- 
sively that substantial progress is being made along all lines 
in the public schools of Tennessee. When we compare these 
summaries with those of previous years, we find that we have 
much for which to be grateful. From this comparison we find 
there has been an increase of school revenue, an increase in 
enrollment of children, and more regular and satisfactory 
attendance of pupils. 
. ScHoon Funps. . 
A comparison of the school revenues for the past nine 
years shows a most gratifying increase. The following shows 
~ the record for the past nine years: 
   Increase, Decrease.

  The remarkable increase shown for the year 1910-11 over 
1909-10 was caused by the passing of the General Education 
Bill giving 25 per cent of the gross income of the State for 
educational purposes. : 
The most encouraging increase of over a million dollars 
for the year 1915-16 over 1914-15 is the result of the increase 
of the school tax by the different counties, as the State gave
-P-A-G-E-19
—is— 
less than the year before. A special effort has been put forth 
to secure the increase of county: tax, and we are glad to be 
able to show how well many counties have responded. 
This increase clearly shows the growing interest of Ten- 
nessee in her public schools. We feel encouraged to hope that 
the time is not far distant when every child in Tennessee may 
have the advantage of a good eight months’ school each year. 
ENROLLMENT. 
One of the most accurate tests by which to measure a 
State or local system of schools is its ability to attract and 
enroll pupils. 
The steady increase of attendance of schools during the 
past nine years is one of the best evidences of the. progress 
our schools are making. 
The increase in enrollment for the year: 
Increase. Decrease. 
1907-08 over 1906-07 is 12,158 
  1908-09 over 1907-08 is. 4,271 
1909-10 over 1908-09 is. 9,595

1914-15 over 1918-14 is... .. cee cece cee 
1915-16 over 1914-15 is 24,049 
  The remarkable increase in enrollment of 1913-14 over that 
of 1912-13 shows the. good effects of the compulsory attendance 
law passed February 18, 1913. The decrease of 7,251 of en- 
rollment for 1914-15 shows a letting up of the enforcement 
of the attendance law. 
_ Averacr Darty ATTENDANCE. 
The efficiency of a system of schools is not measured so 
well by the enrollment as by the average daily attendance... 
The value and worth of the teaching force is measured by the 
daily attendance, for upon the teacher will largely rest the 
keeping of the children in regular. attendance. This was par- 
ticularly true before the. passing of our attendance law,
-P-A-G-E-20

1915-16 over 1914-15 is 3,590 see 
  A comparison of our increase and decrease in enrollment 
with our increase and decrease in daily attendance discloses 
some interesting facts relative to the ability of our teachers 
to hold the pupils in school after they have enrolled. 
From, the tables given above- we had in 1907-08 an in- 
crease in enrollment of 12,158, with a decrease of 10,511 in 
daily attendance. The next year we had an increase of 4,271 
in enrollment and only an increase of 230 in daily attendance. 
The next year shows an increase of 9,595 in enrollment and 
- an increase of 21,218 in daily attendance. The next year 
shows an increase of 7,916 in enrollment with a decrease of 
3,748 in daily attendance. The next year shows an increase | 
of 10,242 jn enrollment, with an increase of 8,683 in daily 
attendance. - The next year shows an increase of 4,116 in 
enrollment, with an increase of only 896 in daily attendance. 
This brings us up to the time when our. compulsory law went 
into effect. These six years show an increase of 109,027 in 
enrollment and an increase of only 34,039 in daily attendance. 
This is a part of the record of which we cannot be proud.’ 
The first year after our compulsory law went into effect 
we had an increase of 49,420 in enrollment and an increase 
of 55,761 in daily attendance. The next year there was a 
decrease of 7,251 in enrollment, with only a decrease of 4,990 
in daily attendance. This last year we had an increase of 
23,184 in enrollment and an increase of 3,590 in daily at- 
tendance. 
During the thre years of the operation of the compulsory
-P-A-G-E-21
=—20— 
attendance law we had an increase in enrollment of 73,469 
aud an inerease in:daily attendance of 59,351. This is the part 
of the record of which we can be proud. 
I am of the opinion that the increase in daily attendance 
is not due alone to the compulsory attendance law, but is 
largely due to the increased efficiency of the teaching force. 
The better the teaching force, the better the daily attendance, 
has always been true. 
Compunsory ATTENDANCE. : 
The tables given above show some wholesome effects from 
the compulsory attendance law passed in 1913, but we are 
not satisfied with the resulis so long as our report shows, as 
does our 1915-16 report, that the school population for our 
State is 778,963, while our enrollment -is 597,634 and our 
average daily attendance is only 420,281. 
Our record for the past ten years shows our sad need for 
longer school terms, better teachers and the strict enforce- 
ment of the attendance law. Ten years ago there were en- 
rolled in the first grades of our public schools 147,255 pupils. 
It is interesting to note how well we succeeded in educating 
this large band of young people. On account of the shortness 
of school terms, the inefficiency of the schools, and the in- 
. difference of parents to keep their children in school, we lost 
the first year 60,875 of these young people. We mean that 
this number failed to enter the second grade the second year. 
The next year we lost 10,030, the next 2,905, the next 11,397, 
the next 29,648, the next 7,913, the next 4 735, the next 2, 617, 
and the next 7,620. 
Out of the 147,255 who entered ‘the first grade, 11,665 
reached the eighth grade. Nine thousand eight hundred and 
ninety-one completed the elementary course, and only 2,425 
received a ten-year education. These figures do not include 
pupils of our city schools. These figures clearly show that 
as a rule pupils quit school at a certain age and not when they 
have completed a certain amount of school work. “This age 
is about fourteen. It is, therefore, urgent upon us to give 
the young people a as much education as possible before. they 
reach this age.
-P-A-G-E-22
—21— 
TEACHERS. 
The gradual increase of teachers’ salaries is clear evidence 
that Tennessee recognizes her teaching force is growing bet- 
ter.. Nine years ago the average yearly salary paid in our 
rural schools was $202.19. For the year 1914-15 the average 
yearly salary was $246.24. For the year 1915-16 it was $241.70. 
We confess this salary is shamefully low, but we are sure as 
the efficiency of our teaching force increases the salaries will 
rise proportionately. : 
THACHER-TRAINING SCHOOLS. 
Sincé the establishment of teacher-training school by our 
State we feel encouraged at the large number availing: them- 
selves of the opportunities afforded by {these institutions. 
Since the establishment of the Normal Schools several hun- 
dred students have been graduated from the academic and 
the normal départments. Many thousands of teachers have 
attended these normal schools, the University of Tennessee, 
and Peabody College, from which they have received an in- 
spiration and vision, the good influence from which has been 
felt throughout the entire State. Fully 19,500 Tennessee teach- 
ers have attended the Summer terms of these institutions dur- 
ing the last five years. The influence of these schools is of 
untold value. We should be proud that a large per cent of 
this good inftuence is felt in the rural schools.. As proof of 
this we give the following per cents: 
Per Cent of Graduates who are Teaching in Rural Schools of 
: Tennessee.

Middle Tennessee Normal, 75 to.80 per cent. 
West Tennessee Normal, about-86 per cent. ~

We cannot be proud of the small per cent of our teachers 
who have had professional training, but we should be glad 
that the per cent is gradually increasing.
-P-A-G-E-23
29. 
In 1912 the per cent with professional training was, white, 
7 per cent; colored, 6 per cent. In 1913 the per cent was, 
white, 9 per cent; colored, 10 per cent. In 1914 it was, white, 
12.6 per cent}; colored, 11.4 per cent, and in 1915 it was, white, 
13.4 per cent; colored, 15 per cent. 
It is encouraging to know that in 1911 we had 124 gradu. 
ates from all the white teacher-training schools and. colleges 
and 419 in 1915, an increase of 237 per cent in five years. 
The increase in the colored work for the same time was. 78 
per cent. 
Stare EXAMINATION AND CERTIFICATION OF THACHERS. 
The law providing for the uniform examination and certifi- 
cation of teachers was passed in 1913. Although it has been 
in operation only three years, yet we are able ta see splendid 
results from its operation. 
The saddest need of our schools is better qualified teachers 
and we feel sure the uniform examination is giving us such 
teachers, The reports of our examinations for the past two 
. years are sufficient evidence that a large number of would-be 
teachers in Tennessee are not qualified. 
In 1915, 14,126 applicants took the examination, and 6,718, 
or about 4714 per cent, received certificates, as follows:

That the State Uniform Examination and Certification 
for Teachers is giving satisfaction is proven by the testimony 
of the County Superintendents. . In order to learn whether or not this law is receiving the 
approval of the school people of the State, I wrote to each 
County Superintendent, asking him: 
1. Does your county approve of the uniform examination 
and certification law? 
To the ninety-six letters sent I received an answer to 
sixty-four of them. Of the sixty-four replying, sixty-threé said 
“We do,’ and one said “We do not.”. By way of. explanation 
let me say the county saying “we do not” is the county where 
last December the examination papers had to be thrown out 
on account of copying and other irregularities. 
2. Do you think our uniform examination and certifica- 
tion law or plans for operating it should be changed in any 
way? 
Of the sixty-four replying, forty said “we do not,” and 
twenty suggested some minor changes as to the number of ex- ° 
aminations, as to the raising of the standard for a first-class 
certificate, etc. Several recommended the charging of each 
applicant a fee of $1.00. 
3. Is the operation of this law raising the standard of 
teachers in your county?
-P-A-G-E-25
—24— 
Of the sixty-four answering, fifty-seven said “it is,” and 
seven said “we can’t see that it is.” 
I was impressed with the positiveness of the answers of 
those who answered affirmatively. Some of the answers were: 
“Yes, sir; it certainly is,” “I am sure it is,” “It certainly is,” 
“Yes, very materially,” “Indeed it is,” “Yes, very much,” . 2 > ? ? r'y o 
“Yes; some who were teaching had to drop out.” 
I have given the above to show you that our State is 
pleased with the law providing for the uniform examination 
and certification of teachers. 
TmACcHERS’ ORGANIZATIONS. 
Tennessee is blessed with teachers’ organizations. We have 
a State Teachers’ Association, The Public School Officers’ As- 
sociation and a Teachers’ Association for each of the grand 
divisions of the State, making five in all. The meetings of 
these associations are largely attended and much good is being 
accomplished by them. 
The State associations have enrollments of from 200 to 250, 
while the sectional associations have enrollments of from 
1,000 to 1,656. 
LippaRins. 
Since 1909, when school libraries became an integral part 
of the State’s educational scheme, and the movement enjoyed 
its first popularity, the work has mounted to new altitudes 
in keeping with the upward trend of things educational. The 
past biennial period has been signalized by an exceptional 
growth and a marked development gratifying to record. Though 
we are far from the goal of our desires, we.are proud to record 
gains on this, as on every other front of our activity. In spite 
of a chapter of difficulties surmounted with larger accom- 
* plishments than ever, when the complete readjustment of the 
work was undertaken.in 1913, and a director appointed, this 
division’s progressive growth is in no place demonstrated with 
greater effect than that throughout the last two years. Every 
month proved a record breaker in comparison with corre- 
sponding previous months.

Liprary Day. 
When a plan is recommended to arouse interest and en- 
thusiasm in school libraries and gets from the schools a re- 
sponse greater than its administrators had faith to expect, it 
is natural that the satisfaction of observing the favorable ac- 
ceptance of the plan should be undisguised. 
The most notable and far-reaching achievement in the en- 
tire progress of the school library movement was the observ- 
ance of Library Day on October 1, 1915. Teunessee teachers 
showed much public spirit and leadership in their successful 
observance of the day, and the interest aroused at that time 
has not diminished in the slightest degree. 
In speaking of this day, the Library Journal, America’s 
leading library periodical, says: “October 1, 1915, promises to 
be an epoch-making day in Tennessee’s school library history, 
as on that date, in compliance with a proclamation issued by 
the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, there was a 
State-wide observance of the day. Early in September Com- 
munity and neighborhood educational campaigns were started 
to arouse and stimulate interest in the school library and the 
day set apart for raising funds for its maintenance. Since 
that date the school library advance has been decidedly notable. 
Applications for State aid are being received in large quanti- 
ties. Tennessee is making permanent provision for more and 
better school libraries properly administered.” 
- Not to fail the schools in their calls for funds has, perhaps, 
been our most constiming ambition since Library Day, when 
the value and place of the good book in the life of the child 
“was made so plain to the patrons of every cémmon school in 
the Vofunteer State. 
GrowtH. 
The statement that Tennessee aided her public schools 
more than $17,000 the last biennial period in establishing and 
supplementing 1,045 libraries in ninety-three counties, is one 
we make with a pardonable thrill of pride and satisfaction. 
We ask you to read the report of the Director of Library Bx- 
tension, found in the body of this report. :

Hien ScHoots. 
From the. examination of the statistical tables you will 
observe that there has, been a steady increase along the lines 
of high school, development. Some-.unimportant things. re- 
main about the same, but these have been in a large measure 
standardized. For instance, the leagth of the term ranges 
from eight and one-half. to nine months. Likewise, the num- 
ber of buildings has not changed materially because of the 
fact that the county high schools have used the same buildings 
as the primary schools. . Likewise the salaries of teachers have 
remained about the same. The significant facts to which | 
call attention are: The number of schools, the number of 
teachers employed, the enrollment, and the average tax levy 
for high school purposes. These are all vital features by 
which the work may be tested, and below is submitted a table 
of comparison. of the four years, 1918, 1914, 1915 and 1916,

One interesting trend of the high school movement in Ten- 
nessee is that of serving the entire county rather than any 
one portion by introducing two-year high schools. Instead
-P-A-G-E-28
of one central high school the county has begun. to feel that 
there should ,be contributing high schools located in the out- 
lying. districts of the county. These serve to increase the at- 
tendance of the central high school in addition to giving. the 
country boy and girl a better opportunity for high school edu- 
cation. Within the two years just closing these schools, have 
increased from forty-three to seventy-eight. The establishment 
of these has been urged in the counties of the State under 
strong regulations so that their growth may be along standard 
lines and articulated with the three-year and four-year high 
schools. This class of school is needed more than ever because 
of the fact that the so-called secondary school has been abol- 
ished. throughout the State. This school, therefore,. affords 
the only opportunity of the district schools receiving instrue- 
tion above the eighth grade. : 
Let me emphasize the importance of Table 11 in the report, 
because of the fact that there can be obtained more nearly 
from this table of ratings the symmetrical development of the 
counties than from any other source. Some of the counties 
are desiring a higher rate of. tax levy, and I should like to 
urge the significance of fixing the maximum of at least 25 
cents on the $100 rather than 15 cents, as at present. A com- 
pulsory high school tax for the State is badly needed in order 
to supplement the primary instruction and to improve the 
school organization. The compulsory law should embody a 
minimum high school tax to be voted by each county, and in 
addition to the tax a. special educational requirement that 
high school work of certain types should be maintained. 
Let. me also call attention to the written’ section of the — 
report of 1913 and 1914. The matters there mentioned are 
still very vial, and 1 should like to make mention of them. 
AID FROM OurSIDE THE Srare. 
For the school year 1915-16 through this department we 
received from the General Education Board $7,000.00 for 
salaries and expenses of J. B. Brown and 8. I: Smith, who 
gave ‘their entire time in the rural school work of the State, 
under the direction of this office.

As a direct result of the $1,500.00 appropriation for Home- 
makers’ Club work for Negroes by the General Education 
Board, 86,714 quart cans of fruit and vegetables were put up 
according to government directions, which at market price 
was worth about $10,000.00; 546 home gardens were cultivated 
according to approved methods; 510 cooking and sewing les- 
sons to 5,600 Negro girls and their mothers, and 165 houses 
were painted or whitewashed. 
The appropriation of $1,800.00 by the General Education 
Board for County Training Schools was given to aid in indus- 
trial equipment, furniture and paint for Shelby, Haywood 
and Fayette counties. : 
The $700.00: appropriated by the General Education Board 
for teachers’ cottages was to be used in connection with the
-P-A-G-E-30

County Training Schools in Fayette and Shelby counties, each 
school receiving $350.00, which is given on condition that the 
communities raise at least that much to supplement the 
amount. These buildings are to be used. for. the principals and 
teachers of the County Training Schools. 
The General Education Board ‘also appropriated $250.00 
to aid in Summer Schools for Negro teachers in Shelby and. 
Fayette Counties, on condition that at least that much would 
be given by the County Boards of Education, or communiti 
The enr rolliment in Shelby County was more than 300 teach T'S 
and in Fayette County about sixty. Every teacher in “the 
Summer Schools was taught some form of industrial work, 
including Agriculture, Manual Training and Home Economics. 
The appropriation of $2,000.00 by the Slater Board was 
used to aid in County Training Schools for colored people, as 
follows: ‘Shelby, $500.00; Haywood, $500.00; Fayette, 
$1,000.00—$500.00 for building and $500.00 for teachers’ 
salaries. The State also gave $1,000.00 to aid in the Fayette 
County consolidated school and the Negroes gave about $2,- 
500.00. | : 
The appropriation by the Jeanes Foundation, amounting 
to $2, 750.00, was given to aid in the employment of Negro in- 
dustrial supervising teachers in fourteen counties. This sum 
was supplemented by funds from the State and counties, 
These supervisors made 1,510 visits to 400 rural Negro schools, 
introducing industrial work and sanitation, organizing com: 
munity centers and helping to increase the teaching efficiency 
of the schools: Under their direction $8,534.52 was raised in 
these counties for school improvement work. 
Through Tuskegee Institute, Mr. Julius Rosenwald has con- 
tributed $300.00 to one rural Negro school in each of the fol- 
lowing ‘counties: Dyer, Maury, Montgomery, Lincoln and’ 
Fayette. The County Boards and communities gave about 
double this amount, or enough to erect model one and two- 
teacher _ buildings with cloak rooms ‘and industrial depart- 
ments. :    
CoNSoLIDATION AND TRANSPORTATION. 
A leading policy of this department looking to the better-
-P-A-G-E-31
—30— 
ment of the conditions of the rural school has been the pro- 
mulgation of the principle of consolidation of the weak one- 
and two-teacher schools where practicable into a three- or more 
teacher school. Very satisfactory progress has been made. 
As a stimulus to consolidation the State Board of Educa- 
tion, by authority of legislative enactment, set aside $25,000.00 
from the Equalization Fund, 1915-16, to be used in encourag- 
ing counties in the consolidation of schools; $20,000.00 of this 
amount to be used for consolidation and 5, 000.00 for trans- 
portation. A like sum was also set apart for the same pur- 
poses for 1916-17 scholastic year. While this sum was not 
large its effects have produced wholesome results. 
Tn 1915-16 twenty-seven counties availed themselves of the 
offer of the State in the erection of consolidated schools and 
twenty-three counties received aid in transportation. 
Already thirty-six counties have applied for State aid for 
the scholastic year 1916-17, and twenty-six have applied for 
school transportation wagons. : 
The assistance offered by the State has not only prompted 
county school officials to investigate conditions of their schools 
with a view to consolidation, but has served to arouse progres- 
sive communities to action. Many of these strictly rural com- 
munities have raised by private subscription sume of from 
$3,000.00 to $5,000.00 for the erection of consolidated schools, 
totaling for all counties aided by the State in 1915-16 not 
less. than $50,000.00. These amounts were met by county ap- 
propriations aggregating $130,000.00. Added to this is the 
$20,000.00 State fund, making a total of not less than $200,- 
000.00 invested in consolidated schools during this scholastic 
year, in which the State has shared in the cost. During the 
year there were in all 123 consolidated schools erected,. bring- 
ing the total number of consolidated schools for the State up 
to 404. 
Strate RequirEMENTs. 
The following conditions must be met by any county par- 
ticipating in the State fund to aid in consolidation: 
1. County levy of 40 cents on the $100.00 for the maintenance of
-P-A-G-E-32
—31— 
common schools (including 15 cents State levy) and’ $2.00 poll (in- 
cluding $1.00 State levy). 
2. The school site.must contain at least five acres ; well adapted ¢ to 
“school purposes. 
3. Plans and specifications must be approved by the State De- 
partment. . 
4, The State will pay one-fourth of the total cost of ‘consolidated 
school building, the State’s part not to exceed $1,600.00, plus one 
transportation wagon. 
5. State aid is provided in the erection of only ‘one building in 
any. county in any one year. 
By virtue of the State’s authority to approve or disapprove 
both the school site and plans and specifications of ‘buildings, 
the State Department has been able to secure adequate and 
well-adapted school grounds and to fix a standard type of 
schoolhouse that will meet the requirements of modern school 
architecture. 
Vocational education has received special emphasis in this 
connection. Grounds must be adapted to agricultural demon- 
stration work, as well as for play and games, and the build- 
ing plans must provide opportunity. for Manual Training and 
Home Economics work.

A total of 28 wagons are in use, hauling an average of 21 
pupils per wagon, at an average cost of $1.25 per pupil 
per month. 
It will be seen from the above table that there was in the 
thirty-four consolidated schools an increase of six in the num- 
ber of teachers employed over and above the combined number 
of teachers in the abandoned schools. At the same time we 
have an increase in enrollment in the consolidated. schools of 
913 over the abandoned schools, or 29.41 per cent, an increase 
of 152 pupils for each additional teacher employed. The 
average number of pupils per teacher in the abandoned schools 
was 27.6; in the consolidated schools 34. Aside from the 
ability of the consolidated schools to attract a larger number 
of pupils to its enrollment, we have the still better test of its 
comparative efficiency in holding its pupils in the increased 
average daily attendance, which was 980, or 42.77 per. cent, a 
total average daily attendance of 170 more than the total en- 
rollment in the abandoned schools. The average daily at- 
tendance per teacher in the abandoned schools was 20.4; in 
the consolidated schools 27.7. 
- The number of recitations per day per teacher in the aban- 
doned schools was .25; in the consolidated schools this num- 
ber was reduced to 11, thus giving to the pupils two and one- 
half times more individual attention, or, in other words, in- 
creasing the recitation period from 13 to 30 minutes. In ad- 
dition to this advantage the number of grades taught have in 
about seventy per cent of the consolidated schools been in- 
creased, giving to the pupils the opportunity for a longer 
school life and the further opportunity to equip themselves 
for high school entrance. : 
The most significant fact in the consolidated school is the 
‘type of teachers that it attracts. The teacher is the soul of 
the school; her education, professional training and experience 
in life are the strong factors in the making of the school. 
Note, if you will, the large number of teachers in the old 
schools who had never been even to a high school—43 against 
4 in the new schools. These teachers in most part received 
their only education in the little school in which they returned 
t «Rp 2
-P-A-G-E-43
—34— 
to teach. Of those who have had a four-year high school train- 
ing, more than four times as many are employed in the con- 
solidated school as in the abandoned school—93 to 22, In 
professional training the number is seven and a half to one in 
favor of, the consolidated schools. In partial college educa- 
tion 33 to 1, and in college diplomas 14 to 1 in favor of the 
consolidated schools. ° 
With. this group of better educated and better trained 
teachers the enrichment of the course of study is made possible. 
Vocational subjects have been added. Home Economics is 
taught in 27, Agriculture in 26, and a number of schools. are 
having installed Manual Training equipment. Under the con- 
ditions of the old abandoned schools the introduction of these 
practical subjects relating to the home and farm life of the 
pupils was not even considered possible. 
School transportation wagons are in use in 23 of the con- 
solidated ‘schools. There is a total of 28 in use, hauling an 
average of 21 pupils per wagon per day at an average cost of 
$1.25 per pupil per month. 
Transportation has been responsible: for considerable in- 
crease in enrollment and attendance of pupils. General satis- 
faction is expressed by pupils with the transportation afforded. 
Teachers report more regular attendance of the children trans- 
ported to school; that thé condition of these children for work 
in their grades is better when they reach the school, and that 
their progress is more uniform and more rapid throug the 
grades, and that much of the confusion and disorder of the 
pupils on the way to and from school is obviated. Patrons 
likewise express satisfaction. In many communities where 
opposition to, consolidation and transportation was very. pro- 
nounced, the patrons have been won over to the support of 
the new school. policy. There is less of sickness and fewer bad. 
colds. The only complaint, which is not fundamental, is di- 
rected against the driver of the school wagons. 
Naturally the superior teacher brings increased salary. 
The average increase of the teacher’s annual salary in con- 
solidated schools over the average salary of the teacher in the 
abandoned schools was thirty-three per cent. This increased
-P-A-G-E-44
—35— 
salary is due to the following: The increase of six teachers 
in the total number employed; the increased annual salary per 
teacher, and the increase in the length of term, from an aver- 
age of five and one-third to six and one-half months. This an- 
nual inerease of 17.8 per cent in teachers’ salaries is 
offset by the increased enrollment of 29.41 per cent, and further 
by the increased average daily attendance of 42.77 per cent. 
To this should be added the superior education and training 
of the teachers employed in the consolidated schools. 
Figuring on the average cost per pupil enrolled, the old 
abandoned school cost $1.60 per month against $1.67 in the 
consolidated schools, or .07 cents per month in favor of the 
abandoned school. Figuring on the average daily attendance 
the cost of the abandoned school was $2.09 against $2.02 per 
month, in the consolidated school, or .07 cents per month in 
favor of the consolidated school. 
One of our leading County Superintendents in speaking of 
the cost of operation of the consolidated school, where a large 
number of transportation wagons are in use, says that he can 
operate the consolidated schools, including the expense of 
transportation wagons, on a cost not exceeding that of the 
cost of operating the abandoned schools. But we cannot fair- 
ly compare the cost of education in the two institutions, be- 
cause they are so very unlike. The one school of one room, with 
and enrollment representing the eight grades, taught by a 
young girl with poor preparation and, in most instances, with- 
out any professional training for her work, as compared with 
the school with three to six rooms, with an enrollment of 
several times that of the small school, taught by from three 
to six teachers, who have had good educational opportunities 
and professional training, presents a contrast that calls for 
no argument. The little school did well in its day, and, in 
a way, satisfied the demands of the times, but we are now 
living in a new era—socially and industrially—and the rural — 
school has a new, broader, bigger field of opportunity and re- 
sponsibility. To meet the new demands the plan and method 
of the rural school must be reorganized and redirected along 
the Vines proposed in the consolidated school and made to
-P-A-G-E-45

relate itself in a definite, effective way to the needs of the 
homes it serves. 
RIcevILLE ConsoLipaTion—McMinn Country. 
During the summer of 1916 the patrons of the Bethel and 
Dogwood Schools (each situated within two miles of the Rice- 
ville School) were canvassed with the idea of securing their 
consent to consolidate with the Riceville School. As a result 
of this campaign the two schools above named were abandoned 
and the pupils transported to the Riceville School, beginning 
with the present session. The following record of the average 
daily attendance in the three schools is self-explanatory. For 
the month of September, 1915, the average daily attendance 
was: 
Riceville, 120; Dogwood, 19; Bethel, 19. Total, 156. 
For the month of September, 1916, in the Riceville Consolidated 
School the average daily attendance was: 
_ Riceville, 136; Dogwood, 43 (transported); Bethel, 45 (trans- 
ported). Total, 224. 
A gain of 66 in average daily attendance, or 41.8 per cent 
over the combined old schools. From the old Bethel School 
an increase of 136 per cent in average daily attendance, and 
from the old Dogwood School an increase of 121 per cent. 
The old abandoned schools were each taught by one teacher ; 
the Riceville consolidated school is taught by six teachers. 
Home Economics, Agriculture and Manual Training form a 
part of the daily instruction. 
GREENE County CONSOLIDATION. 
Last year Greene County erected eight consolidated schools, 
supplanting twenty-two old school buildings. The record of 
combined enrollment and attendance in the old abandoned. 
schools and the consolidated schools is as follows: Enroll- 
ment in consolidated schools, 1,009; the abandoned schools, 
624. Attendance consolidated schools, 898; the abandoned 
schools, 495. Agriculture is taught in each of these consoli- 
dated schools, Home Economics in four, and a teachers’ home 
is provided for.at one of the schools. The total amount ex-
-P-A-G-E-46
—37— 
pended in the erection of these eight consolidated schools was 
$26,800,000. 
ANDERSON CouNTY CONSOLIDATION. 
The largest number of consolidations made during the 
scholastic year 1915-16 was perfected in Anderson County, 
where thirty-eight one- and two-teacher schools were supplanted 
by thirteen schools of from three to eight teachers. While 
these school buildings were erected during the scholastic year 
1915-16, they were not occupied by the schools until the be- 
ginning of the present session. 
The total cost of the thirteen buildings aggregated about 
$72,000.00, $50,000.00 of which was secured through a bond 
issue by the county, the remainder special fund and contribu- 
tions made by the patrons of the several consolidated dis- 
tricts. The buildings are all brick or brick veneer, attractive - 
in design, modern in their arrangement, lighting, heating and 
ventilation. Agricultural demonstration work either has been 
or is to be conducted on each of the school plots. In most 
of these schools Home Economics is being taught, and in a 
number of them Manual Training equipment has been pro- 
vided. The principals of all of these schools are either normal 
school or college graduates and have had experience in school” 
work. Eight per cent of the assistant teachers have had nor- 
mal training. Two of these schools have been provided with 
teacherages, and it is the plan of the County Superintendent 
to place a teacherage on the site of each of the thirteen con- 
solidated schools. 
The counties receiving State aid for the scholastic year 
1915-16 were as follows: Anderson, Benton, Campbell, Blount, 
Cannon, Cocke, Coffee, Dyer, Fayette, Grainger, Greene, Ham- 
blen, Hawkins, Humphreys, Jefferson, Johnson, Knox, Lincoln, 
Loudon, McMinn, Polk, Robertson, Sevier, Henderson, Smith, 
Putnam and Sequatchie. 
Conclusion. 
In conclusion, I wish to thank the school officials and 
teachers for the loyal support in all our efforts to improve the
-P-A-G-E-47
—33— 
public school system of Tennessee. I especially wish to thank 
your excellency for the hearty support and encouragement 
you have given the cause of education during the past two 
years, and under your leadership we confidently look forward 
with much hope to the coming two years. 
Respectfully, 
: S. W. SHErrin.

THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
To the Honorable Superintendent of Public Instruction of 
Tennessee. 
Dear Sir: I beg to submit to you my report of the organ- 
ization, work and financial statement of the University of 
Tennessee for the biennial period of 1914-15 and 1915-16, in 
obedience to the requirements of Section 9 of the General Edu- 
cation Bill of 1909, and to long established custom. 
The work of the University during the period covered by 
this report has been characterized by a steady and increasing 
striving not only to maintain but to advance its standards and 
to work out by a most careful study of the needs of the State a 
better adaptation of its work to meet those needs. The high 
standards referred to in my last biennial report have been 
fully maintained. In all of its departments the University is 
ranked in the first class. Nothing short of such ranking would 
satisfy our ambition, and even under the increasing difficulties 
due to insufficient support we will strive most earnestly to 
maintain this standing. Unless the State University is main- 
tained on the best national standards, it will fail in its duty to 
all of the other schools, public and private, in the State. For 
the State University in every state is more and more being 
looked to as the standardizing agency of that state, and its 
ranking of other schools in its state is now taken as the best 
obtainable ranking of such schools. The importance to all, 
therefore, of its standards being the best is evident. It is an 
encouraging evidence of the substantial advance of the high 
schools of the State that during the period covered by this 
report the increase of the numbers of students successfully 
meeting the high standards of the University has been greater 
than ever before. The fact that the largest increase of attend- 
ance has been in the College of Liberal Arts shows that in the 
main the development of our high schools has been a healthy 
one, not yielding too much to the popular clamor for a bread- 
and-butter education, but realizing that an education without 
idealism is only half an education to a human being, The
-P-A-G-E-153
—144— 
growth of the University, however, has been an all around one, 
the technical and professional schools sharing as they should, 
losing numbers only as the result of raising standards or as 
the result of industrial conditions over which we have no 
control. 
THE BOARD. 
The Board of Trustees is now constituted as follows:

An examination of the above tables will show that, gen- 
erally speaking, the counties from which no students are in 
attendance at the University are those that have no county 
higl schools, or in which the high schools are not properly 
developed. The figures show that the attendance is fairly 
evenly distributed over the whole State. 
: DEPARTMENTS. 
There has been no change in the organization of the Uni- 
versity since my last report, except the establishment of the 
Country Life Course for Women, which will be treated some- 
what in detail later. The University comprises the following 
departments: The Graduate School, the College of Liberal 
Arts (ineluding the School of Commerce and the School of 
‘Idueation), tlie College of: Engineering, the College of Agri- 
enlture, the. College of Law, the College of Medicine, the 
College of Dentistry, the School of Pharmacy, and the Sum-
-P-A-G-E-158
_ —~1L9— 
mer School of the South. The Colleges of Medicine and Den- 
tistry (with the School of Pharmacy and the Premedical 
Course) are located at Memphis. The other departments are 
located at Knoxville. : 
The standard character of the work of our Graduate 
School and College of Liberal -Arts has put these departments 
in the first class. Only four other state universities in the 
South are similarly rated and only nine other institutions of 
every sort. Considering the small income available to us from 
all sources, this fact speaks volumes for the devotion and 
efficiency of our faculty, whose spirit of consecration is most 
creditable. The educational requirement of teachers in the 
high schools of the first class is graduation from a standard 
college. To offer preparation to meet this requirement is the 
object of the work in education. This work is on a strictly 
collegiate basis and requires that the student. should have 
completed the first two years of a regular college course before 
entering on it. Special arrangements are made to receive the 
graduates of the State Normal Schools and pass them on to 
graduation with the degree of Bachelor of Arts in Education 
or Bachelor of Science in Education without loss of time. An 
increasing number of Normal School graduates are annually 
availing themselves of this opportunity. The department is 
ably manned and is very successful. 
The School of Commerce, which was inaugurated in 1913, 
is growing steadily in the character of its work and the num- 
bers in attendance. The object of the school is to offer oppor- 
tunity to students to secure a general college training while 
acquiring a wealth of special preparation that will be of the 
most practical value to them in a business career. There is a 
large and urgent call for well-trained men of this character, 
both in the enlarging activities of purely domestic concerns 
and in the rapidly expanding foreign trade of the United 
States. It is worthy of the most careful investigation from 
the young man who is looking forward to.a business career. 
The College of Engineering is feeling the stimulating effects 
of the revival and development of industrial activity due to 
many causes, but particularly to the European war. In Civil,
-P-A-G-E-159
—150— 
Mechanical, Electrical, Highway and Hydraulic Engineering 
the courses are entirely satisfactory, and the graduates are in 
demand by the large companies. In addition to the regular 
work, the College is conducting night schools for mechanics 
in the larger cities of our State and short courses and confer- 
ences on highway construction and other subjects, as well as 
correspondence instruction on technical subjects. 
The College of Agriculture has continued to increase in 
numbers and efficiency. The number in attendance on it in 
1915-16 reached a total of 214, Besides the instruction work to 
regular students, it gives annually short courses to farmers 
at Knoxville and at many other places in the State. This latter 
work is conducted by the Division of Extension under the 
provisions of the Smith-Lever Agricultural Extension Act by 
funds contributed by Congress and by the State. The Experi- 
ment Station is also a division of this College. AII phases 
of its work have been greatly stimulated since my last report 
by the gift by Knox County and citizens of Knoxville, of the 
Cherokee farm of 569 acres as an addition to the agricultural 
plant of the University. A new course has been installed in 
this college for young women who expect to live in the country. 
It is referred to in detail later. 
The College of Law is on thoroughly national standards. 
The young man or woman intending to practice law in’ Ten- 
nessee will find no law school so well adapted to give proper 
preparation as this one. It is a member of the Association of 
American Law Schools and is fully registered in the State of 
New York. _ 
The College of Medicine at Memphis is a Class A school, 
with admirable laboratory, hospital, and clinical facilities. 
In common with all standard colleges of medicine, it requires 
for admission the successful completion of at Jeast one year’s 
work in a standard liberal arts college in Physics, Chemistry, 
Biology and a modern language. Provision for this required 
preparatory work is made both at Knoxville and at Memphis. 
Tennessee students should, as a rule, seek this preparation at 
Knoxville, where there is no charge for tuition to them. A 
concession in fees is made to residents of Tennessee in the reg-
-P-A-G-E-160
—151— 
ular medical classes. We hope, as we are financially able to do 
so, to make still further concessions to Tennessee students to 
the end that the study of medicine may not be prohibited to 
persons of talent but of small means. 
The College of Dentistry is developing satisfactorily both 
as to attendance and as to the further working out of its 
courses of instruction. It is conducted on standard Jines and 
is a member of the National Association of Dental Faculties. 
The School of Pharmacy is well organized and effective. 
Its graduates are uniformly successful in the practice of their 
profession. It is a member of the American Pharmaceutical 
Association. 
The Summer School of the South has continued to be 
largely attended by the teachers of Tennessee as well as by 
many from other states. It has been formally adopted by the 
Board of Trustees as an integral part of the University and 
will try more and more to find its proper place in the educa- 
tional system of the State. Work for college credit has become 
a more characteristic feature of the school during the past 
few years, and such work will be more largely encouraged 
and developed hereafter. The delightful climate of Knox- 
ville makes it peculiarly well adapted to a satisfactory sum- 
mer school. 
Country Lire Course ror WomeEN. 
Beginning with the session of 1916-17, the University is 
offering a new course in the College of Agriculture, which is 
planned to give a reasonable and attractive training for these 
women who expect to live in the country. It combines cultural 
and practical subjects in proper balance. The sciences funda- 
mental to agriculture and home economics, a knowledge of which means so much to the country woman, are duly stressed. 
Subjects that will fit her to take her part in community up- 
building are also given full consideration. The course leads to the degree of Bachelor of Science. The requirements for admission are met by the curricula of the county high schools. 
Plans are being worked out to greatly reduce the cost of living at the University for women students who are willing to do
-P-A-G-E-161
some work to supply their own personal needs. It is antici- 
pated that this will become a very popular course when it is 
understood and appreciated, 
THe Marrer or eXpenses. 
It is: the. steadfast policy of the University to offer the 
greatest possible opportunity to the earnest student at the 
lowest possible cost. There is such a thing, however, as cheap- 
ening things to the point of destroying the advantages that 
might otherwise be obtained. We will avoid this extreme. 
With tuition free to men and women in the Colleges of Liberal 
Arts, Engineering, and Agriculture, the Schools of Commerce 
and Education, and in the Preliminary Medical Courses, and 
with the contribution of the State to the payment of traveling 
expenses of students, the problem reduces itself to a question 
of actual living expenses. To a considerable extent these are 
within the contro] of the individual student. There are Joan 
funds from which some money may be borrowed, and there are 
an increasing number of opportunities for self-help. Under 
the management of the University Y. M. C. A. there is an 
employment bureau through which both young men and young 
women can often secure remunerative employment during their 
spare hours. So far as such employment does not interfere 
with health or with college duties it is desirable. But stu- 
dents should not count too much on maintaining themselves in 
college, as such use of their time may deprive them of partici- 
pation in many of the activities which go to the making up of 
the normal college life. 
University Extension. 
Under the stimulus of larger appropriations from the 
National Government and from the State, the work in agricul- 
tural extension has been greatly extended during the past two 
years. The Department of Agriculture at Washington has co- 
operated closely with our Division of Extension, with the result 
that in their judgment the extension work under the Smith- 
Lever Bill has worked more perfectly in Tennessee than in any 
other state. We have enjoyed the continual co-operation of the 
railroads of the State, the Boards of Commerce, School Boards.
-P-A-G-E-162
—153— 
the State Department of Agriculture, and other organizations. 
By such general co-operation the largest possible results have 
been obtained. . 
Extension work has also been conducted by the College of 
Enigineering in several of the industrial centers of the State. 
In the werk we had the encouragement and actual financial 
assistance of the Tennessee Manufacturers’ Association, and 
many alumni of the University and others interested in the | 
work have given freely of their time as instructors and other- 
wise. They have largely made the work possible with the 
limited funds available. Other technical courses have been 
conducted by correspondence and much practical guidance has 
been given in this way. Lantern slides and moving picture 
films have been freely loaned to schools and other organizations 
and have contributed to the movement to make the school- 
house a community center. 
Tue Experiment Srarion. 
Back of the teaching and extension activities of the College 
of Agriculture is the Experiment Station, which is devoted to 
the investigation of agricultural problems, many of them 
peculiarly on our State conditions. The two main stations 
are at Knoxville and Jackson, while co-operative work is car- 
ried on at Clarksville and at a number of other points in the 
State. This interesting and important work has expanded 
steadily for the past ten years and is a source of much interest 
and benefit to the people of the State. 
ResuME. . 
The field of activity of the University is large. It covers 
teaching, both within and without its walls, and research in 
many phases of thought. Its opportunity is unlimited. It 
needs only a larger support to be able to occupy the ground 
lying right at hand and ready to be cultivated. A former Gov- 
ernor of Tennessee sounded the slogan: -“Let us invest our 
money in education and declare dividends in men.” Never 
was the time for such investment more ripe, with the certainty 
of large yields in the best kind of interest.

ANNUAL REPORT TENNESSEE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL. 
Hon. Samuel W. Sherrill, State Superintendent of Public In- 
struction, Nashville, Tennessee. 
Dear Sir: In response to. your request, I take pleasure in 
presenting to you a report of the Tennessee Industrial School 
from December 20, 1914, to December 19, 1915, our last fiscal 
year. : 
The pupils are about equally divided in number in the 
literary and industrial departments. One-half of them attend 
school in the forenoon, while the other half are employed in the 
various industrial, mechanical and commercial departments, 
and vice versa in the afternoon. This system makes possible 
the constant operation of all branches during the entire school 
day, thus giving the children an education and, at the same 
time, teaching them one of the following trades and indus- 
tries : 
Architectural and mechanical drawing, automobile engi- 
neering, bread making, barbering, broom making, blacksmith- 
ing, bookkeeping, cabinet making, carpentry, care of steam 
boilers, cooking, dressmaking and embroidery, electrical work, 
floriculture, harness and shoe repairing and shoe making, in- 
tensive farming, mattress and quilt making, painting, printing, 
steam laundering, storekeeping, shorthand and typewriting, 
telegraphy, tailoring, vegetable gardening, wood carving, work 
in the machine shop, work in hotbed and cold frames, work in 
barn and care of stock. 
The influence of the institution is sieadily increasing, and 
its indispensable service to the State is receiving more recog- 
nition each year. The highest and best manifestation of its 
efficiency is the great number of former pupils now holding 
lucrative positions and creditably discharging positions of 
trust and responsibility. The eagerness of the pupils to take 
advantage of their opportunities is a source of constant pleas- 
ure. Every pupil is taught to regard the institution as a home 
and the officers and teachers as their friends. Each pupil re-
-P-A-G-E-164
—-155— 
ceived is examined by the physician. The hospital facilities 
are adequate and comfortable, and are in charge of skilled 
and faithful nurses. 
The general deportment of the pupils affords no reasonable 
grounds for complaint. The discipline throughout the institu- 
tion was never better than at present; a general good fecling 
prevails among the boys and girls of the various departments, 
and the work they are doing shows that they are interested 
thoroughly in the industrial and commercial branches; also in 
the literary studies. 
General school examinations for promotion are held after 
each session of twelve months, and special examinations are 
given as often as occasion may demand. The literary studies 
extend through those found in the curricula of high schools. 
The department of music is under the direction of compe- 
tent teachers and affords much pleasure to our population and 
visitors. The pupils are not permitted to allow this study to 
interfere with their work in the literary and industrial de 
partments. The military band of about fifty pieces, composed 
of boys between eight and seventeen years of age, still enjoys 
the reputation of being one of the best musical organizations 
in the State, and probably the best school band in the country. 
The concerts given on the Jawns in the summer are largely at- 
tended by appreciative audiences from the city and surround- 
ing community. . 
All of the brooms, mattresses and part of the ice used by the 
institution have been manufactured by the pupils. They have 
also manufactured several hundred mattresses for the other 
State institutions. Much of the clothing and furniture have 
been made by them. They have done a great deal of the paint- 
ing, printing, carpentering, blacksmithing, pipe laying and 
other miscellaneous repair work. The farm and dairy have 
proved fairly productive and profitable. A new printing office 
building 36’x76’ has been erected and equipped with all mod- 
ern equipment. This important department is doing a large 
part of the State’s printing. 
We received from all sources since the opening of the in- 
stitution, December 15, 1886, to December 19, 1915, 7,326 pupils.

The management would be pleased if every citizen of Ten- 
nessee would avail himself of the opportunity of visiting the 
institution and become acquainted with the methods employed 
and the results that are being realized. It is a regrettable 
fact, indeed, that so many of our intelligent citizens have so 
little real knowledge of the scope and character of the work 
that is being done here for the homeless, dependent and way- 
wardly inclined children of the State. The school is open to 
visitors every day except Saturday and Sunday.

ANTITUAL REPORT FOR THE TENNESSEE SCHOOL 
FOR THE BLIND. 
October 16, 1916. 
Honorable S. W. Sherrill, State Superintendent of Public 
Instruction, Nashville, Tenn. 
Drar Sm: It is a pleasure and privilege to submit the fol- 
lowing report of the Tennessee School for the Blind for the 
~ sessions 1914-15 and 1915-16. 
All children from six to twenty-one years of age who, by 
reason of defective vision, cannot procure an education in 
schools for the seeing are entitled to admission into this 
school, provided they are physically and mentally capable: of 
receiving instruction. 
Total enrollment from September 1, 1914, to June 1, 1915, 
218; 108 girls, 110 boys. 
Total enrollment from September 1, 1915, to June 1, 1916, 
231; 117 girls, 114 boys. 
Total enrollment from September 1, 1916, to October 16, 
1916, 209; 97 girls, 112 boys. 
A spirit of earnestness and enthusiasm pervades the entire 
school. Lessons are better prepared, good conduct and disci- 
pline are maintained, and harmony and good feeling prevail. 
The health of the entire student body has been excellent. 
We have had no contagious disease, few cases of serious illness 
and no loss by death. 
Our usual custom of having pupils vaccinated, eyes exam- _ 
ined, treatments prescribed and operations performed has been 
strictly followed. This past session a dentist has been em- 
ployed by the Board of Control. He has examined the teeth of 
all pupils, has given needed treatments and performed the 
work that was necessary. This has given much comfort to our 
children and they have been greatly benefited thereby. 
The Literary Department is carefully graded and every 
effort has been made to approach in efficiency the best schools 
for the seeing. The course of study is similar to that pursued 
in our foremost preparatory schools. Our text-books in tactile
-P-A-G-E-173
—164— 
print are counterparts of those used in public schools. The 
three departments, Primary, Grammar School and High 
School, embrace the twelve grades. 
Progress in the Primary Department has been excellent. 
The first step in the path of knowledge must be guided with 
greatest care, for a misconception of the work of training the 
little minds just beginning to think and wonder would be a 
mistake that would require years to correct. 
The Grammar School and the High School departments 
continue to advance, many of the pupils making rapid progress. 
Classes in this school must of necessity be smaller than 
in other schools, never, if possible, numbering more than from 
fifteen to twenty students. The teacher, therefore, comes in 
personal contact with the children, and what is learned from 
observation by children in other schools, she must impart. 
to our children by word pictures, demonstration or explana- 
tion. : 
Besides ability and book knowledge, our teachers must be 
resourceful, must be possessed of tact and patience, and, like 
every true teacher, must love their work and be interested in 
the development of the young minds in their charge. 
While our pupils are graded, our teachers are not. A room 
is assigned a teacher in which she remains and receives dif- 
ferent grades every forty minutes. By this arrangement the 
pupils receive exercise in passing from room to room and are 
greatly benefited by being thus brought under the influence of 
every teacher. 
Stated written examinations have been held with satis- 
factory results. , 
In 1915 two Grammar School certificates were given and 
three diplomas. 
In 1916 three received Grammar School certificates and 
two diplomas. 
The Department of Music, justly considered most valuable 
and important in the education of the blind in preparing 
them to become skilled in an art in which so many of the blind 
become proficient, and in which they so siccessfully compete 
with the seeing, has maintained its standard of efficiency. 
.
-P-A-G-E-174
—165— 
Instruction is given on pipe organ and piano. Individual 
voice lessons are given and two choruses are trained. A 
thorough course in Staff and Braille Notation, Harmony, 
Theory and History of Music is given. Upon completion of 
the course medals are awarded. In 1915 one was presented, 
and in 1916 two received medals. 
Our band consists of thirty boys, ranging in years from 
ten to twenty-one. 
All pupils are given an opportunity to study music, but if 
it is found that a child has no ability, he is assigned other 
work. 
Beginning with the fourth grade, lessons in expression 
are given each pupi]. The object of this training is not so much 
to make public readers, as to benefit the pupils in articulation 
and enunciation. Memorizing selections tends to strengthen 
the memory, increases the vocabulary and familiarizes the 
pupils with our best writers. / 
Work in the Physical Culture Department has progressed 
satisfactorily. Our splendidly equipped gymnasium is an 
inspiration and great interest has been manifested by the 
pupils. Hard work and development have resulted. 
In the Industrial Department the boys are taught cane- 
seating, broom-, mop-, mattress- and hammock-making and 
piano tuning. Girls are taught to sew by hand and on ma- 
chines; to cut, fit and make dresses; to make bead and raffia 
work; to darn, knit, crochet and weave rugs. They do the 
household sewing for the institution. Every effort is made to 
prepare the children to earn a living and to take their part in 
the world’s work. 
The school for the colored blind is. continuing its excel- 
lent work. The education given is thorough and practica}. 
A Grammar School course is given and the girls are taught 
to knit, darn, mend, sew and do the household work of which 
they are capable. 
The boys are taught to make mattresses, brooms and cane 
chairs. They are also instructed in piano and vocal music, 
some of them becoming quite proficient in the latter. 
Respectfully, 
Joun V. Armstrrone, Superintendent.

ANNUAL REPORT FOR THE WEST,gTENNESSEE STATE 
NORMAL SCHOOL. 
Hon. 8. W. Sherrill, State Superintendent of Public Instruc- 
tion, Nashville, Tenn. 
I hand you herewith a statement of the work of the West 
Tennessee State Normal School for the school year 1915-1916. 
The session has been a happy and prosperous one. Students 
and faculty have worked harmoniously together and the im- 
provement in the school, both in point of numbers enrolled and 
internal organization, is noticeable. The enrollment during 
the fall, winter and spring terms shows a gratifying increase, 
being 478 against the 425 of the previous year. The only rea- 
son it has not been larger has been because of our inability to 
care for more, especially in our boarding department. We are 
limited to about 225 boarding students, and approximately 
this number has been in attendance all year. Some students 
who desired boarding accommodations were turned away dur- 
ing the spring term, and many others did not come because of 
the reports of the crowded condition of our dormitories. It is 
very evident that the school will have as many students as it 
can take care of, and if we had additional boarding accommo- 
dations our enrollment would be correspondingly increased. 
A noticeable feature of the enrollment is that it has been about 
the same for the three terms: 352 the fall term; 345 the winter 
term, and 409 the spring term. Three hundred and twenty-five 
students have been in attendance throughout the entire year. 
The work of the school is well organized. We carry every 
department of study that belongs to a first-class normal 
school of Junior College rank, and in every department there 
are one or more instructors offering courses which, in number 
and scope, will compare favorably with the best Normal schools 
of the country. 
Facutty aNp OFFICuRS. 
The members of the faculty have worked in entire harmony 
and have cooperated with the President in every possible way
-P-A-G-E-179
—170— 
for the benefit of the school. I cannot speak- too highly of 
the faculty—their academic preparation, their consecration to 
* the school, their sympathy with the students, and their appre- 
ciation of the material and educational needs of the territory 
we serve and the desire to meet them—both in the school and 
out among the people and teachers in West Tennessee. 
Messrs. Patterson and Cummings have been on leave of ab- 
sence during the year, both carrying on studies at Harvard 
University. Mr. Patterson will return for ‘the coming year, 
and Mr. Cummings will continue at Harvard. Mr. J. F. Zim- 
merman has had charge of the work in history during Mr. Pat- 
terson’s absence, and Mr. A. S. Lee has been substituting for 
Mr. Cummings. 
Facuiry AcTIvItigs. 
We have done a considerable amount of extension work dur- 
ing the year. Members of our faculty have attended teachers’ 
meetings in various counties, have addressed community gath- 
erings, and aided in community organizations, have assisted in 
making courses of study; in fact, whenever and wherever the 
call for help has come, our teachers have responded. Mr. Man- 
ning has addressed six monthly meetings of the teachers of 
Weakley County and eight monthly meetings of the city teach- 
ers of Memphis. Mr. Webb has participated in seven meetings 
in Dyer County, one in Hardeman, one in McNairy, two in 
Tipton, and two in Shelby. Mr. Dennison, five in Crockett and 
five in Carroll. Miss Pritchett, six in Madison County, and 
has organized story-telling leagues in five county schools in 
Shelby County and has directed story-telling before the Juve- 
nile Court of Memphis. Mr. Zimmerman, two meetings in 
Henderson, one in Henry and one in Lauderdale, and has done 
a week’s institute work in Henry County. Mr. Lee, eight be- 
fore the city teachers of Memphis. Dean Loggins, four in- 
Hardeman, one in Henderson, one in Shelby, two in Benton 
and one in Decatur. Mr. Vaughan, two in Shelby and eight 
meetings of the city teachers of Memphis. Dr. Hood, two in 
Shelby County and a week’s institute work in Henry County. 
Misses Buquo and Dodd have prepared a course of study in
-P-A-G-E-180
—171— 
Home Economics for the Shelby County schools and have 
directed the meetings of the Home Economics Club of Shelby 
County during the year. Mr. Watters addressed one meeting 
in Tipton County, and Myr. Jones one in Tipton. Mr. Davis 
spent a week or ten days with the “Better Farming” campaign 
of the Memphis Farm Development Bureau of West Tennessee, 
and addressed farmers’ meetings in ten. or twelve counties in 
our section. President Brister attended meetings in Tipton 
County three times, Shelby five times, Carroll three, Henry 
two, Dyer two, Haywood four, Crockett four, Weakley two, 
Decatur one, and Memphis city teachers eight times. The 
members of the faculty have been much in demand for com- 
mencement addresses and have responded whenever possible. 
Sruvent Bopy. 
The student body shows decided improvement in numbers 
and also in general educational ability. The registration for 
the three terms total 478, which means an average attendance 
of not less than 350 for each term. One gratifying fact about 
the attendance is that, with the exception of a few who have 
dropped out, the student body has been practically the same 
throughout the year. Another encouraging fact about the 
registration is that about one-half of the total number of stu- 
dents are in the three upper classes. If we exclude the high 
school students from Messick territory and the irregulars, who 
entered in the spring term, particularly for the State examina- 
tions, we would find that only about fifty pupils have registered 
in the first two years of high school rank. 
The size and standing of the Senior Class is especially 
gratifying. We turned out this year forty-eight full graduates, 
sixteen of whom are men; heretofore, we have had only six 
male graduates from the school. Some of these men are ma- 
tured and have had considerable teaching experience; all of 
them are strong and well-equipped, and will render valuable 
service in West Tennessee. The young ladies of the class are 
of the same high character, and they, too, will give a good 
account of themselves in all school activities.

Bulwpines ann Equirmenr. 
The buildings of the West Tennessee State Normal School 
are in good condition. Last summer the parlor and walls of 
the first floor of the girls’ dormitory were painted at an’ ex- 
pense of $400. This improvement has added greatly to the 
beauty and serviceableness of the buildings. A door has been 
cut this spring in the north end of the dining hall which will 
obviate the necessity, heretofore existing, of the young men 
boarding students passing through the girls’ building three 
times a day to and from their meals. This door was put into 
use for the first time during the summer term. An extension 
to the kitchen has also been made during the spring. This will. 
add greatly to the sanitary conditions in the kitchen and to 
the comfort of those there serving. The door and the kitchen 
extension cost aproximately $100.00. A tenant house on the 
farm was built last summer at a cost of $250.00. We have 
also built during the year sheds for scales costing $25.00, a 
small ‘poultry house in the yard costing $16.00, and made re- 
pairs on the barn at a cost of $100.00. Much of the labor 
on these jobs was furnished by Mr. Cash and his hands. 
According to instructions from the State Board of Educa- 
tion, we have purchased equipment during the year for the 
commercial department amounting to $622.50. Of this amount, 
$317.50 has been paid, leaving a balance of $305.00 payable by 
the middle of February, 1917. We have purchased also for . 
the Manual Training Department three first-class woodwork- 
ing machines to the amount of $673.35, and three motors for 
driving these machines to the amount of $204.90. Yn putting 
in these motors it was necessary to change our motor for the 
waterworks system to a three-phase motor. The exchange 
price, together with the cost of changing the wiring system 
to a three-phase circuit, amounts to $145.75, which makes the 
total motor charge for the Manual Training Department 
$350.65, or the cost of the installation of the machinery 
$1,023.90. This purchase was ratified by State Superintendent 
Sherrill on instructions from the State Board of Education.

Farm. 
I submit the following statement from the head of the 
Department of Agriculture. I call attention especially to the 
fine showing made by the farm in feeding beef cattle during 
the current year. The net gain of $704.53 is very gratifying. 
“To the President: 
“I hereby submit my report of the Agricultural Department 
for the year 1915-16. 
“The enrollment for the year is as follows: 
Agriculture 10, 11, 12.............. 0.008 fee. V1 
Agriculture 20, 21, 22............. cece eens 12 
Agriculture 30, 31, 32........ 0.0.0 c cece eee ee 9

Agriculture 60, 61, 62...........0..00. 0000, 4 
Messick Students .............. 2. cece ee eee 18 
UA) 6 9 88 
“The work of the students on the whole has been very good, 
only a few failures during the fall and winter terms. An in- 
creased interest on the part of the students of the department 
is due to increased laboratory work. The time has been equally 
divided between the class room and laboratory. The labora- 
tory, however, is yet inadequately equipped. 
Farm Equipment. 
“The farm is fairly well equipped in the way of machinery 
and implements for a small farm like ours. The needs in this 
line will be small for the coming year. 
Feepine Live Stock. 
“As you know, the farm has been supplying the dining hall 
with pork and beef during the greater portion of the past year. 
I wish to call your attention to the report on the handling of 
live stock. You will note that the profits have amounted to 
something over $700. By the close of the summer term we 
expect to add to this at least $150 more, making $850.
-P-A-G-E-186
~177— 
“Our greatest handicap in these operations is the size of 
the farm. With forty or fifty more acres of land in addition 
to our present acreage we could fatten cattle and hogs in 
sufficient quantities to meet the needs of the boarding depart- 
ment. Besides, we would operate a small dairy that would 
furnish good, wholesome milk and butter for the students. This 
would prove another source of income for the farm. 
“With additional land we could manage the farm in such 
a way that profits could be made on the following things: 
“1. Beef and pork. 
“2, Dairy products. 
“3. Poultry. 
“4. Vegetables and fruit. 
“5, Pigs (thoroughbreds). | 
“Additional land would also enable us to furnish work to 
worthy and needy boys so that they could materially lessen 
their expenses while here in school. 
“I trust that you may see your way clear to recommend 
and urge the State Board to purchase the necessary additional 
land so that the department may be prepared to develop the 
farm as suggested above. 
: “Respectfully submitted, 
= . “(Signed) C. W. Davis.”

CAMPUS. 
During the year the State Board of Education. authorized 
certain improvements on our campus. President Harned se- 
cured the services of Prof. Charles A. Keffer, of the University 
of Tennessee, and he made plans for certain roads, walks and 
grading. Professor Davis, of our Department of Agriculture, 
codperated with Professor Keffer in this work, and has had 
charge of the making of the beds and setting out the shrubbery 
and trees according to the plan prepared by the latter. Four 
or five thousand pieces of shrubbery and several hundred trees 
have been planted during the year. <A six-foot concrete walk 
from the end of the street car line to the center of the main 
building, and an eighteen-foot concrete-front connecting the 
walk and the main building, have just been completed, This
-P-A-G-E-188
—179— 
work was done by Mr. Cash, superintendent of the grounds and 
buildings. There are 5,284 square feet of concrete, or 889 2-3 
linear feet, six feet in width. The cost of construction was 
$458.83, which is 52 1-3 cents a linear foot, or 8 2-3 cents a 
square foot. The work is substantially done and is a decided 
improvement to the campus. The plans contemplate consid- 
erable road building. In our estimates made by Mr. Cash it 
will take 450 yards of gravel. This gravel can be bought at 
$1.05 a yard, and can be hauled at 40 cents a yard, so that the 
estimated .cost of the roads already provided for will be 
$750.00. The County Commissioners have agreéd to change 
one.or two roads now on the campus, and to do some grading 
for us, and we are waiting upon them before proceeding further 
with it. 
Booxstore. 
T call your attention to the fine showing made by our book- 
store. According to our bursar’s books the receipts during 
the past year have amounted to $3,044.68, and disbursements to 
$2,616.95, leaving a balance to the credit of the store of $427.75. 
This does not include the books.on hand. If their value were 
added the balance would be greatly increased. This bookstore 
has been under the general direction of Mr. Watters, of our 
Commercial Department, and has been looked after by one of 
our students, to whem we gave board for service, charging the 
same, of course, to the bookstore. 
Msnvuau TRAINING DEPARTMENT. 
I submit herewith a report from Prof. ©. H. Wilson, of the 
Manual Training Department. He makes a very good showing 
for bis department, especially in the matter of articles made 
for the school during the school year. With the new machin- 
ery which is being installed he will be able to make much more 
than he has this year, and at less cost. 
“To President JW. Brister, 
“Sm: I have the honor as head of the Manual Training 
Department to submit the following report for the academic 
year 1915-16: 
“The enrollment in the department has been very gratify-

“The work done by the students this year has been above 
the average, both in quality and quantity, some excellent ar- 
ticles of furniture having been constructed. An exhibit was 
made at the Tri-State Fair in September, 1915, the Normal 
School display being awarded the first prize. Among the ar- 
ticles on display were bookcases, library tables, piano benches, 
taborets, umbrella stands, hall trees, footstools, and other 
pieces of furniture, which attracted much favorable comment. 
“In addition to the projects in furniture constructed by the 
pupils as individuals, the manual training classes during the 
year worked out a number of pieces of furniture and apparatus 
for various departments of the school. The list of projects 
constructed is as follows, the prices quoted being taken from 
catalogues of school supply houses and representing what the 
articles would cost exclusive of freight: 
1 large bookcase, with glass doors, for Manual Training

“The efficiency of the department for the ensuing year will 
be greatly increased, due to the addition of power machinery 
to the equipment. 
“A twenty-four-inch surfacer, an eight-inch jointer and a 
variety saw table, with horizontal mortising attachment, have 
been purchased and will be installed during the summer term, 
1916. These machines are of the latest improved design and 
of the highest type of construction, being manufactured by 
the American Woodworking Machinery Company. Each ma- 
chine will be individually motor-driven, which gives the great- 
est ease and convenience in operation, and each will be com- 
pletely safeguarded by all of the latest safety devices. 
“In addition, a course involving the use and care of power 
machinery will be offered, which will prove of especial value 
to those students who may later have an opportunity to teach 
manual training in a well-equipped school. 
“Respectfully submitted, 
“CO. H. Wirson, Head M. T. Dept.” 
Neeps. 
The Board is well aware that we need at the Normal School 
2 dormitory for men and a dining hall for our boarding stu- 
dents. If we accept Mr. Prescott’s figures for the rent of his 
flat building for next year we will have to pay him $1,500, 
-and he states that he would not make that figure for a longer 
time, but would expect for the succeeding year $1,800. We 
are also renting the upper part of a house belonging to Mrs. 
Brooks near the campus at_$200 a year. This will make our 
rent in the near future at least $2,000 a year. This State 
could borrow money at about 314 per cent. I hope the Board
-P-A-G-E-191
—is2— 
will try to persuade the next Legislature, if they will not give 
us enough money outright to provide us these buildings, to 
borrow, say $75,000, and let the school pay the interest on the 
same, if it can be arranged. With this $75,000 we might erect 
part of a men’s dormitory and a dining-hall. We would cer- 
tainly get much better accommodations than we now have; 
and even if we have to pay the interest, it would not be at a 
greater expense than the school is now carrying. 
The school is also in need of additional land, as pointed out 
in the report of the agricultural department. 
Other needs are a Training School building on the campus 
and a well-equipped gymnasium.

bursements for the year beginning September 15, 1915, and

The above table shows a steady but substantial increase 
since the establishment of the Normal School, and is evidence, 
not only of the need of the schoo], but also that the operation 
of the school has met with the hearty approval of its student 
body. - 
Extension Work. 
Believing that a State Normal School can do a most effec- 
tive type of extension work in the several counties at sessions 
of the county court, school rallies, teachers’ meetings, agricul- 
tural meetings, good roads meetings, school commencements, 
ete., it has been the policy of the State Normal School to attend 
such meetings, and during the year all of the East Tennessee 
counties have been visited once or more by the President, 
Dean, or some member of the Faculty. In this way the Nor- 
mal School coéperates with all movements for improving the 
life of our people. 
The following list shows some of the extension work done 
by members of the faculty from July 15, 1915, to July 15, 1916:

In addition the President of the school visited teachers’ 
institutes in Unicoi, Sullivan, Sevier, Monroe and Loudon 
counties, 
During the past year the President and nearly every mem- 
ber of the faculty of the East Tennessee State Normal School 
have been engaged more than ever before in the extension work 
in the several East Tennessee counties. Members of the fac- 
uliy have conducted and worked in teachers’ institutes in 
many counties, have attended and spoken at good roads meet- 
ings, community meetings, and have, in a number of counties, 
appeared before county courts in the interests of high schools, 
consolidated schools, bonds for school buildings, and increased 
levies for buildings and general school purposes. 
This extension work should be continued and enlarged. 
In no other way can the school be of more service to the gen- 
eral school interests than to do really helpful work in the 
several counties. We are unable to meet all the calls that are 
made on us. Many schook buildings have been erected in East 
Tennessee during the past year from specifications furnished 
by the Normal School. Many consolidations have been effected 
by the influence of the members of the faculty. High schools 
have been established. New consolidated school buildings 
have been erected. Better teachers have been employed. It 
is hoped that the finances of the school will permit, after a 
short while, the employment of an extension worker who shall Meigs County_.-.--.-.---one week__

time shall be largely devoted to outside work. 
While the school may not be able to respond to all the 
calls made upon it for help, it will, in every case possible, 
render assistance in the following ways: 
I. To County Courts: 
1. Addresses in the interest of higher school levies, high 
schools, consolidated schools, school bond issues, longer 
terms, and larger salaries for better teachers. 
II. To Boards of Education: 
1. Assistance in securing suitable teachers through the 
Normal School Committee on Appointment and Employ- 
ment. 
2. To furnish floor plans for school buildings, and to give 
estimates of costs of proposed buildings. 
III. To Superintendents: 
1. Professional help in all questions of school administra- 
tion. 
. Addresses at school and community meetings. 
. Help in the selection of suitable teachers.

IV. To Teachers: 
. Aid in securing desirable positions. 
. Professional help through correspondence. 
3. Plans for industrial work in cooking, sewing, school 
gardens, manual training, plans for community work, 
parent-teachers’ associations, and club work. oF wb be 
V. To Farmers: : 
1. Short courses in agriculture offered during the winter 
term. 
2, Individual help in solving farm problems, as milk test- 
ing, spraying, seed testing, fertilizers, ete.

CONFERENCES, 
During the year three important conferences were held 
at the Normal School: A Home Economics Conference on 
November 12 and 13, 1915; a Country School and Country 
Life Conference on March 30, 31, and April 1; and a Confer- 
ence of East Tennessee County Superintendents on June 21, 
22, and 23. All of these conferences were well attended, 
aroused much interest on the part of students and others, 
and contributed very largely to the work of the School. 
The County Superintendents appointed a committee to in- 
vestigate the work and needs of the State Normal School, and 
the report of this committee is as follows: 
Report or ComMMirrer to INvesTiGATh THE WoRK AND N&EDS 
: oF THE Stats Normar ScHoot. 
/ We, the committee appointed by the Superintendents’ 
Conference to investigate the East Tennessee State Normal 
School, beg leave to submit the following report: 
We have made a careful, detailed, and thorough examina- 
tion of the buildings, equipment, and grounds, and have found 
everything in a thoroughly satisfactory condition. 
We find the usual fine and large enrollment of enthusiastic 
and efficient elementary teachers from practically every county 
in East Tennessee, and the fine spirit of enthusiasm that per- 
vades the student body is possibly the highest recommendation 
of the State Normal School that could be spoken.
-P-A-G-E-209
—200— 
We have found the campus in a very fine condition, and in 
the course of a system of beautifying that will make it second 
to none in the country. We commend. the Agricultural De- 
partment of the East Tennessee State Normal School for the 
rapid advancement that has been made in such a short time, 
handicapped by unfavorable conditions. 
We find the buildings of the East Tennessee State Normal 
School thoroughly modern in all respects, and we especially 
commend the efficient way in which the girls’ dormitory is 
~ conducted. 
We find that the hoarding facilities are unusually cheap, 
girls paying only fifty cents per week for clean, sanitary room 
in the girls’ dormitory; and the boys and girls alike securing 
good, substantial, wholesome table food at an average cost 
of 10 to 11 cents a meal. We wish to commend the executive 
department of the East Tennessee State Normal for providing 
for the economic management of the boarding facilities. 
We have made a complete examination of the cooking 
arrangement and the new Cafeteria, and find that there is 
nothing to be desired from a hygienic standpoint. - 
We congratulate not only the students of the Hast Ten- 
nessee State Normal but also the patrons of the public schools 
of East Tennessee for the very efficient faculty that is direct- 
ing the work for teacher training in East Tennessee, and com- 
mend President Gilbreath for his fine executive ability in 
managing the East Tennessee State Normal School, which is 
second to none in the South. 
We earnestly ask that a dormitory accommodating at least 
one hundred and fifty young men be immediately erected and 
that additional dormitory room be added for the accommoda- 
tion of at least one hundred more young ladies. We sincerely 
believe that the East Tennessee State Normal School is handi- 
capped most seriously in its work by the Jack of sufficient dor- 
mitory accommodations, and in our opinion the State of Ten- 
nessee could not render a better service to the childhood of 
East Tennessee than to provide this additional room so that 
young men and young women will have opportunity to become 
proficient in the art of teaching the young mind.
-P-A-G-E-210
—201— 
Last, but not least, we feel that any report of the East 
Tennessee State Normal School would be incomplete without 
giving our estimation as to how the work of the normal school 
reaches the rural children.. We believe that no influence has 
contributed so much to the increased efficiency of the rural 
teaching force as the State Normal School, and we, the County 
Superintendents in joint conference assembled, testify to. the 
marked and noticeable improvement in the methods and work 
of the rural teaching force in the past few years, which, in a 
large meastire, can be attributed to the East Tennessee State 
Normal School.

Facutty MEgEtines. 
The entire faculty meets regularly. At these meetings re- 
ports of committees are made and individual reports sub- 
mitted. Most of the time at faculty meetings is devoted to 
discussion of the larger and more vital problems of education, 
with especial reference to East Tennessee and the work of the 
State Normal Schoo]. 
At each meeting a paper is read by some member, and is 
then open for general discussion. The following papers have 
been presented :

The plans and specifications for this building were made by 
Prof. W. C. Wilson, of the Manual Training Department, who 
superintended its entire construction and equipment. ‘The 
total cost of the building and equipment was slightly in excess 
of $1,500, all of which has been paid out of the local funds of 
the school. This building furnishes board to a very large num- 
ber of students. It was first opened on June 7, and was 
largely patronized. It is run on the cafeteria plan, and board 
is furnished at a very reasonable price. 
The building is 80x40 feet, and the dining-room proper is 
64x40. Heretofore noon lunches have been served in connec- 
tion with the Domestic Science Department, but this service 
interfered with the work of the classes in cooking. Only one 
mIneal was served each day. In the new cafeteria three meals 
are served daily. Mrs. Gurley, the manager of the school 
. dining hall, has the general management of the cafeteria, and 
work in the dining-room proper is done by the students. 
Boarpine DeparrMEnt, 
Our Boarding Department, which is managed on the co- 
operative plan, has been, despite the constantly increasing cost 
of living, more satisfactorily administered than ever before, 
and at no increase in cost to the students. 
With the small number patronizing the school during the 
fall term, the cost of board for the first two months was’ 
twelve cents a meal. This was gradually brought down until 
during the spring term the cost was only ten cents a meal. 
This cost included the salary of the matron, the wages of all 
helpers, the cost of all food supplies, and of all additional 
dining-room and kitchen furniture and equipment. The cost 
of board as fixed provides also for a very small profit to take
-P-A-G-E-212
—203— 
care of the unavoidable wear or damage to the larger and 
more costly articles in the boarding department. 
Posrrions ror GrapuatTEs. 
During the first four years the East Tennessee Normal 
School issued certificates and diplomas to 256 graduates. 
During the past year 194 of these 256 graduates were engaged 
in teaching—174 of them in Tennessee schools; 24 graduates 
were students during this year in this or some other institu- 
tion; 19 had married since graduation; and 15 others did not 
teach. ~ 
The graduates, however, represent only about ten per cent 
of the total number of teachers who have attended the school. 
Reports from county superintendents show that a very large 
majority—probably eighty per cent of all who attended the 
Normal School for any time—teach school following such at- 
tendance, and nearly all are teachers in rural schools. While 
the primary function of the Normal School is to train teachers 
for the elementary schools, and in the main for rural elemen- 
tary schools, nevertheless its courses are very helpful to teach- 
ers in all grades of schools, and we have had a good representa- 
tion from city school systems. 
. At the present time six graduates, or students of the Hast 
Tennessee State Normal School, are serving as county super- 
intendents. A few of our graduates have been employed by 
the Department of Agricultural Extension as lady agents or 
county collaborators. Many of the Manual Training and 
Domestic Science departments in high schools are filled by 
Normal School graduates, and a few of our graduates have 
been chosen as principals of county high schools. A consider: 
able number have become principals of consolidated or sec- 
ondary schools, but the great majority. of those who have at-’ 
tended the East Tennessee School are engaged in teaching in 
rural communities. 
ScHooL GarpEns. 
Under the supervision of Professor Gabbard, assisted 
largely by student labor, school gardens are being developed 
this year, the products of which are being and will con-
-P-A-G-E-213
—204— 
tinue to be sold to the school dining-hall. Very satisfactory 
progress has been made in the development of this new de- 
partment, and in addition to furnishing a most useful labora- 
tory for the young men and young women who are doing 
work in the Department of Agriculture, it will also furnish 
work to a number of students and at the same time help to 
keep at a reasonable price the cost of board in the dining-hall. 
If the funds of the school should ever permit it is hoped to 
establish a model dairy in connection with the school. 
Gas EquipMEnt. 
During the first years of the operation of the Normal 
School there was no gas plant in Johnson City, but in the past 
two years a modern gas plant has been put in operation. 
Through the courtesy of the Gas Company lines were laid to 
the main building and cafeteria without cost to the school, 
these lines amounting in all to about one thousand feet, the 
gas pipe being donated to the school in this way. We have in- 
stalled gas fixtures in the laboratories and gas stoves in the 
Domestic Science room, and in the kitchen of the cafeteria. 
Unrrep Srupent Bopy. 
During the year the students of the Normal School, on their 
own motion, organized an association known as the United 
Student Body, membership in this association being open to 
students and members of the faculty alike. This organization 
assessed each member $1.00 a term to meet the necessary 
expenses of a lyceum course; of the school athletics, including 
basket-ball, baseball, tennis, and track work; and of the stu- 
dent publication. The vote organizing this voluntary organi- 
zation and making the assessment was practically unanimous. 
It was the wish of the association and of the faculty that the 
assessment of $1.00 a term, for the purposes named, should 
be authorized by the State Board of Education. The State 
Board of Education, at its annual meeting in July, approved 
the recommendation made, and ordered that each student pay, 
in addition to the registration fee of $2.00 a term, an addi- 
tional fee of $1.00 to be used for the purposes named. ,
-P-A-G-E-214

. RECOMMENDATION. 
I beg to call the special attention of the Board to the 
urgent need for additional dormitory accommodations at the 
Hast Tennessee State Normal School. Our enrollment during 
the regular year, as shown elsewhere in this report, was 536. 
The enrollment for the summer term was largely in excess of 
that number. All of these students, except about one hundred 
and twenty young women who are accommodated in the dor- 
mitory, and the comparatively few students who live at home, 
must find lodging in private homes. This scatters the student 
body, making it impossible to develop the finer school spirit 
that living together would encourage, and adds very materially 
to the expenses of students. 
In the dormitory lodging is furnished at a cost of $2.00 
a month. When students lodge in private homes the cost is 
from $4.00 to $5.00 a month.. As the school is situated fully 
a mile from the central part of the city, those who lodge in 
private homes must live from a half-mile to a mile and a half 
from the school. We shall never be able to do so good work 
as ought to be done until provision ig made for ample dormi- 
tory accommodations for all the students, both men and 
women. Of course, with the funds apportioned each year to 
the normal schools, it will be possible to build additional 
dormitories only through State appropriation. I believe that 
if your honorable body would prepare a statement of the con- 
ditions and needs of the normal schools and give it wide pub- 
licity, it would do much to secure the needed appropriation. 
I hope that the members of the next General Assembly may 
learn from the official action of your Board that the Board, 
as well as the presidents and faculties of the normal schools, 
are united in urging that better provisions be made for the 
accommodation of the thousands of teachers who, on their 
own initiative, through compulsion, or for other reason, are 
working to prepare themselves for more efficient service for 
the State. 
Additional room is needed for classwork, particularly in 
the Industrial Departments of Agriculture, Cooking, Sewing, 
and Manual Training. The need for a special agricultural
-P-A-G-E-215
—-206— 
and industrial building is very great. The uormal school, in 
addition to its regular academic and professional courses} 
should be a leader in the development of the State industrially. 
All teachers should have a good working knowledge of one or 
more industrial courses in order that they may not only give 
such instruction to their pupils but also that they may be 
interested in the larger activities of the community. An agri- 
eultural and industrial building erected and used at the Nor- 
mal School would be a very fine investment for the State. 
Additional library room is imperatively needed. No spe- 
cial provision for a library was made in the erection of the 
building. One room has been set aside as a reading room 
and library, and this has already become too small to care 
for the books and periodicals and to furnish room for the hun- 
dreds of students who use the library and reading room, 
and who use it to great advantage. If an agricultural and in- 
dustrial building could be provided, it would make it possi- 
ble to give additional room in the Main Building for library 
purposes. 
If the East Tennessee State Normal School could. have 
$100,000 added to its buildings and equipment, it would be in a 
position to render most useful service to Tennessee. It should 
be borne in mind in this connection that aside from the annual 
appropriation of normal school funds, as fixed by the General 
Education Law, the State has never made any direct appro- 
priation to any of its normal schools. 
ConcLusion. 
I cannot close this report without expressing to the Board 
and to each member of the Board, my grateful appreciation 
of their uniform approval of the work done at the East Ten- 
nessee State Normal School, and of their many courtesies ex- 
tended to me personally. I hope that the members of the 
Board may find it possible in the very near future to visit 
the East Tennessee State Normal School and to make a thor. 
ough inspection of all its departments and to enjoy the hos- 
pitality it desires so earnestly to extend. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Sipney G. Gitpreatu, President.

MIDDLE TENNESSEE STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. 
Hon. S..W. Sherrill, Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
Nashville, Tenn. 
You will find herein brief report of the Middle Tennessee 
State Normal School for the scholastic year 1915-16. 
This institution first opened its doors to students Monday, 
September 11, 1911. The growth of the institution has been 
steady and healthful, as will be indicated by tabulated state- 
ments shown elsewhere in report. 
Larcs Percentacr or Men. 
During the regular fall, winter and spring terms for the 
year 1915-16 more than forty-two per cent of the total enroll- 
ment were men. So far as I am able to ascertain this is the 
largest pereentage of men students in attendance of any 
Normal School in the United States. This augurs well for 
the teaching profession. Unquestionably one of our greatest 
needs is more strong, well-equipped men in the teaching ranks. 
Exrension Work. 
It has been the policy of the Middle Tennessee State Nor- 
mal to serve the school interests of the State in every prac- 
tical way. Every faculty member has done extension work 
in some form. Last year our teachers conducted work reg: 
ularly in the monthly county institutes of the nearby coun- 
ties, carrying on the particular line of work the County Su- 
perintendent was stressing. The same thing is being done 
the present year. Aid was also furnished to every county 
institute held in Middle Tennessee after the summer school of 
the Normal had closed. County courts have been addressed 
and various educational gatherings have been attended by the 
President or some faculty member for the purpose of securing 
better school facilities for the children of the State. 
It is our purpose to make the library serve, if possible, peo- 
ple who may never be permitted to look on our shelves. The 
librarian, Mrs. Bettie Murfree, has collected material on sub- 
jects appropriate for debates, essays, themes, etc., and will be 
glad to send any of this literature to teachers who will write
-P-A-G-E-217
~-208— 
for it. Lf the library cannot furnish just what is needed, the 
librarian will send a bibliography of material on the subject 
you wish to investigate. There is no charge for any service 
the library can render. As the literature the library would 
send out would be in the form of magazine articles, newspaper 
clippings, government reports, etc., the postage would be very 
small. The library will pay this one way, and the teacher, 
after keeping the material two weeks, will pay the return 
postage. 
Report or Farm. 
The farm during the past year has made a very satisfac- 
tory 6Howing. The receipts are in excess of the disburse- 
ments, Besides, some valuable permanent improvements have 
peen made. A concrete silo with a capacity of 180 tons has 
been constructed, and 420 rods of good wire fence has been 
built. A splendid equipment for dairy has been installed, the 
dairy herd enlarged, and some minor equipment provided for 
the farm. The corn and hay crops were unusually good. We 
have two hundred thirty tons of silage and approximately one 
hundred twenty-eight tons of hay and fodder, and ninety bar- 
rels of corn. I might add that several hundred loads of barn- 
yard manure have been placed upon the land, and perhaps 
our greatest gain is in the improvement of the farm lands 
which were badly worn and run down when the school was 
established.

NEEDS OF THE INSTITUTION. 
1. The classes are too large in many subjects, and the 
teaching force should be enlarged so that the number of sec- 
tions may be increased and the size of the class reduced. 
9. The farm lands were purchased on time, and the, pay- 
ments have been met out of the annual maintenance fund. 
This is not sufficient to maintain the school in a high state of 
efficiency, let alone carrying the debt for farm lands. I would 
recommend that this burden be removed and the Legislatures 
be asked to make a direct appropriation to pay the outstand- 
ing indebtedness on the farm. , 
3. We are very much in need of a laundry in connection 
with the school plant. Practically all dormitory students give 
their laundry to negro washerwomen who carry it home with 
them and keep it out almost an entire week. I need not speak 
of the danger incident to communicating disease by this meth- 
od. I would recommend the installation of a laundry at the 
very earliest date possible. 
4. The State owns one dormitory in which almost one 
hundred young women can be comfortably cared for. At 
present two large residences owned by Messrs. Harrison and 
Ridley are rented for women. About sixty can be comfortably 
roomed in these two large residences. There is no dormi- 
tory for the boys. The old Mooney dormitory is rented for 
their occupancy, and it will accommodate about fifty young 
men. The State is paying $2,500 per year for rented prop- 
erty in which to house students, and-then the demands for 
room are only partially met, as a Jarge number of students 
are forced to board in town and walk quite a distance. In 
addition to the inconvenience, it costs on an average at least 
$3 per month more to secure private board than it does to 
board in the dormitory. It will, thus be seen that the State 
is paying $2,500 per year for rented property, and the stu- 
dents boarding in private homes a like amount, in excess of 
what it costs to board in the dormitory. : 
The amount paid for rented property and the extra cost 
to students to board in private homes would pay the interest
-P-A-G-E-224
—215— 
on more than enough money to erect a dormitory. It resolves 
itself into a question of whether the State is more-able to 
build a dormitory than the young men and women who are 
preparing to become teachers are able to pay for not having 
one. I would recommend that. the dormitory now in use for 
women be set apart for the young men, and that a dormitory 
with a capacity sufficient to accommodate two hundred and 
fifty be erected for women. 
In conclusion, I want to thank the Board for their hearty 
cooperation and kind courtesies extended. 
Very truly yours, 
R. L. Jonus, President.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE AGRICULTURAL AND 
INDUSTRIAL STATE NORMAL SCHOOL 
  
Hon. 8. W. Sherrill, State Superintendent of Public Instruc- 
tion, Nashville, Tennessee. 
Dear Siz: I have the honor of submitting the following 
report on the work of the Agricultural and Industrial State 
Normal for the year of September 1, 1915, to September 1, 1916. 
This has been the most successful year in the history of the 
school, both in point of attendance and work accomplished. 
The colored people of the State are rapidly waking up to the 
importance of industrial education and are sending their 
children here in increasing numbers each year for the pur- 
pose of preparing them along industrial lines. So great has 
been the demand for industrial work that it has been neces- 
sary to employ additional teachers in almost all industrial 
departments. : 
The following is the enrollment of the industrial depart- 
ments for the past year:

The Domestic Art Department includes plain and fancy 
sewing, dressmaking, drafting, handicraft, millinery and art 
paper work. The courses are designed to prepare girls to do - 
for themselves the necessary things of life and to fit them to 
teach this work in elementary schools or to do it successfully 
for others. 
The plain sewing includes mending garments and making 
of plain garments, such as children’s clothes, overalls, shirts, 
ete. It also teaches the use of machine utensils, selection of 
materials and principles of cutting. 
The fancy sewing embraces Mexican and Spanish drawn 
work, various kinds of embroidery and crochet. Dressmaking 
gives drafting of patterns, making washable, woolen, silk and 
evening dresses, and also practice in tailoring of coat suits. 
Handicraft is planned especially for teachers in rural 
schools. It gives a variety of shuck, splint and reed work and 
utilizes pine needles, straws and local materials. . 
The art paper work teaches girls to make flowers, party 
favors and baskets. 
Domestic Science. 
The aim of the Domestic Science Department is to teach 
the girls to study the process of cooking and classification of 
foods, so that they may better understand how to cook the 
plain, ordinary food of the home and make it palatable and 
digestible. It embraces canning, preserving and jelly making, 
and teaches to economize in all branches of household eco-
-P-A-G-E-227
—218— 
nomics. The girls are taught to be tidy and neat and how to 
properly care for the kitchen and its utensils and furnishings. 
It is also the aim of this department to prepare teachers for 
the city and rural schools of Tennessee; to prepare demon- 
strators to do the larger and broader work in domestic science. 
AGRICULTURE. 
The fact that scientific farming is the hope of the South is 
fully recognized. This department is endeavoring to play its 
part by furnishing better prepared negro farmers. The 
instruction in this department is both theoretical and prac- 
tical. Every student above the grammar grades is required to 
take one course in agriculture each year, and a regular course 
is given those who desire to study agriculture as a trade or 
profession. The school farm furnishes the boarding depart- 
ment with all vegetables and the major part of other food- 
stuffs that can be raised successfully in Tennessee. 
Among some of the crops raised during the past year which 
have been or will be used by the boarding department are:

The general scheme of cultivation is planned with 
the idea of teaching the farmer how to raise and 
cultivate such crops as will enable him to furnish foodstuffs 
for himself and stock. The school has purchased this year'a 
herd of dairy cattle at a cost of $1,050.00 and is now furnishing 
its own supply of dairy products and is teaching the practical 
as well as the theoretical side of dairying. By means of the 
herd of 111 head of swine the department has been able, not 
only to teach swine raising, but to furnish a goodly portion of 
the pork used by the boarding department. 
MrcHaNnicau. ’ 
The following trades for young men are taught in the 
mechanical department: Architectural and mechanical draw- 
ing, carpentry, brick and stone work, plastering, painting, 
steamfitting and plumbing, blacksmithing and wheelwrighting, 
applied electricity. 
The training in this department does not tend to train a 
single set of faculties, but, on the other hand, to develop all 
mental and physical powers. In all branches of our mechan- 
ical activities it is our chief aim to produce a thinking in- 
dividual and one that will act because he is thinking. , During 
the past year we have had an opportunity to erect one perma- 
nent building, the new dairy barn, size 36x72 feet, having a 
capacity for thirty head of cows, keeper’s room, weighing room 
and hay loft for sixty-five tons of hay. The building has a con-
-P-A-G-E-229
—220— 
erete floor and is equipped with Lowdens’ sanitary equipments. 
The plan and specifications and all work including carpentry, 
plumbing, concrete and bricklaying, roofing and painting were 
furnished and executed by this department. This department 
has kept up all repairs and has done a considerable amount of 
painting. The greatest need of the department is more room, 
so as to be able to do more work and a better grade of work. 
The Mechanical Department has endeavored to codperate with 
the Department of Rural Education in furnishing plans and 
specifications for the rural school for colored people in the 
State. 
Manuvau Arts, 
Under the head of Manual Arts, students are given instruc- 
tion in free-hand drawing, color design, paper and cardboard 
construction, clay modeling, leather work, and brass construc- 
tion. 
The purpose of the course is to cultivate the taste and to 
develop a general appreciation for the most suitable, the most 
useful and the most beautiful. 
The average man needs first to know how to furnish’ his 
home, how to choose his clothing, and how to arrange his busi- 
ness advertisement. Our course points the way. 
Students are also taught how to make useful and beautiful 
objects from ordinary material, such as paper, clay, leather, 
ete. 
Launpry. 
The girls are taught laundering under an experienced teach- 
er, and all of the laundry work of the institution, as well as 
that of the student body, is done in the school laundry. 
LIrerary. 
The literary work is planned to meet a two-fold purpose 
of the school, i. ¢., to prepare teachers for the elementary and 
high schools, both city and rural, and for scientific farmers and 
artisans. With this end in view the industrial and literary 
work is correlated as far as possible. We believe that every
-P-A-G-E-230
—221— 
artisan should have a thorough literary training, and we en-. 
deavor to teach those subjects which will be most helpful in 
developing mental powers. 
The literary work begins with the Fifth Grade of the Gram- 
mar Department and embraces the other grammar grades, four 
years academic and two years normal. The grammar grades 
serve as a training school for the members of the senior normal 
class. 
In June, 1916, there were graduated from our Normal De- 
partment, ten girls and two boys; Academic Department, 
twelve girls and five boys; Domestic Art Department, twenty- 
three girls, making a total of fifty-two Normal graduates, fifty- 
nine Academic graduates, thirty-eight Domestic Art graduates, 
and five Domestic Science graduates. 
One of the greatest advertisements the school has is the 
efficient work being done by our graduates. Among the posi- 
tions being held by them are: City teachers, rural teachers, 
county and district supervisors. 
We have a well-ventilated and well-lighted library and 
reading room. Our library has 1,267 bound volumes and 444 
pamphlets. In the selection of these we have tried to bear in 
mind the particular needs of those who are to come in contact 
with the library, namely, the rural school teacher and pupil, 
for it is from them that we draw the majority of our student 
body. In our reading room, which is open day and night, may 
be found several magazines and daily papers. 
The aim of our library and reading room is to create in 
those who come in contact with them a taste for reading that 
which will stimulate their lives to better thinking and higher 
ideals, thereby assisting education in developing good citizens. 
Stupenr ORGANIZATIONS. 
Among the various organizations of the school there are 
three literary societies, the Junior and the Senior Literary for 
girls and the joint Junior and Senior Literary for boys. These 
societies meet twice a month, and their object is to acquaint 
the student with parliamentary laws and their usages, to 
strengthen their knowledge along literary lines and to instruct
-P-A-G-E-231
—222— 
them in preparing and presenting high-class programs. 
Once a year the societies enter into a debate, which ac- 
quaints them with the rules of debating and reveals to them 
the great value of a true and friendly rivalry. 
There is not only an effort put forth to develop the mental 
side of the boys and girls, but the spiritual as well. There 
have been organized a Y. M. C. A. anda Y. W. C. A. and Sun. 
day school classes, all of which are under the supervision of 
members of the faculty. 
EXTENSION. 
By way of rural extension quite a bit of work has been 
done by members of the faculty.. County fairs have been at- 
tended and demonstrations been given at fairs and community 
meetings. At different times members of the faculty have con- 
ducted county institutes, and we feel that much good has been 
done for the teachers and patrons of rural districts. 
Neeps or tag [Nsrrrurion. 
On account of the limited dormitory space we have been 
forced to turn down applications of students from various 
parts of the State, when suitable homes could not be found in 
the surrounding community. We, therefore, need dormitory 
space for four hundred instead of two hundred. Among other 
needs of the institution some of the most urgent are: Trade 
building for girls, addition to present trade building for boys, 
agricultural building, and teachers’ home. 
In conclusion, I would say that we attribute the success of 
this year’s work, the greatest in the history of the school, to 
the hearty codperation and liberal support of the Board of 
Education and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
Thanking you in behalf of the colored people of the State 
for past favors, I am, Sincerely yours, 
W. J. Haus, 
President.

~~ 295 — 
ANDERSON COUNTY. 
The year just closed witnessed the opening of the large con- 
solidated school at Robertsville, which is a splendid farming 
community five miles from the nearest town. The building 
was not completed until late, and the heating apparatus was 
installed still later. Many difficulties were encountered; but 
notwithstanding every handicap, much good work was accom- 
plished during the session. 
The following will illustrate a few of the activities of these 
consolidated schools: 
During the year nine large brick and brick veneer consoli- 
dated school buildings were erected at a cost of about $57,000. 
‘One. of these buildings has two class rooms and two work 
rooms; six have four class rooms and basement; one has six 
class rooms and a large auditorium and corridor; one has eight 
class rooms and a basement. The basements of six.of these 
buildings are not yet complete on account of lack of funds. 
The basements of all the four-room buildings, when complete, 
will consist of one large community assetubly room, a domestic 
science room and a manual training room. AlIl buildings have 
provisions for assembly rooms, domestic science and manual 
training rooms. I am enclosing small photographs of all the 
new buildings except one, and also the Marlow building and 
the Clinton building. In two or three instances the assembly 
rooms are made by throwing two or more large class rooms to- 
gether by means of sectional doors or sash partitions. These 
buildings are already taking the place of seventeen one-room 
abandoned buildings, six two-teacher abandoned buildings, and 
one three-teacher abandoned building, making a total of twenty- 
four already abandoned, with seven more one-room schools to 
be brought into them a little later when some road improve- 
ments are made.- This does not include two new brick veneer’ 
consolidated school buildings and schools to come under next 
year’s report, nor any abandoned schools displaced by the 
frame consolidated school buildings. One of these buildings has 
already been completed except the basement, and the other is 
half finished. I might also add that the first district con- 
. St. Rpt. 8
-P-A-G-E-235
—226—- 
solidated school has all but killed another smaller school not 
far from it, and it is only a matter of a short time fill it will 
be completely abandoned. . 
The patrons of the Robertsville school desired musie added 
to the course of study, but had no piano. They banded together 
and bought a fine one at the beginning of the session. They 
also bought chairs for the auditorium. One of the roads over 
which one of the school wagons had to travel during the winter 
became very bad. This created such a clamor that the county 
graded and macadamized in this last summer. -A creek gave 
considerable trouble. The county is just. completing a good, 
substantial bridge over it. . 
Mr. Geo. Chandler, formerly vice-president of the Royal 
Consolidated Coal Company, has turned over to the Briceville 
Consolidated School a mining fund sufficient and for the ex- 
press purpose of equipping a manual training department for 
the Briceville Consolidated School. 
Capt. E. A. Reed, whose company gave the site for the 
Reed Consolidated School, in the Seventh District, is 
very much interested in having the students of that school con- 
struct a dam across the creek flowing by it in order to furnish 
power for a good mechanical and industrial department for 
the school. 
Three pianos have been bought by the codperation of patrons 
for as many consolidated schools during the last three weeks; 
many parent-teachers’ associations have been organized; and 
the schools are preparing for a series of educational lectures 
illustrated by stereopticon views, etc. An agricultural and 
home economics short course strictly for grown-ups will be 
put on a little later in the season. 
I could not be honest and say that all the improvements 
in the county schools have not aroused any opposition. The 
opposition ‘has been and is still very bitter at times. In fact, 
it looks very alarming to many of our people to see so much 
done for the “little barefoot boy,” for whom so little has been 
done before in the way of equalizing educational opportunity. 
Although $407,000 worth of bonds for roads and bridges have 
passed into history in our county and left scarcely a murmur,
-P-A-G-E-236
—227— 
$50,000 worth of school bonds have so alarmed some of our 
people that they are walking the floor, as it were, and erying 
for “the Lord to have mercy on us;” and I might add that I 
never saw a prayer that is being more rapidly answered in 
Anderson County at this time. 
But while we have our grumblers and kickers, we have a 
host of the very best citizenship that any county ever boasted 
of, whose very hearts and souls are wrapped up in these schools; 
and they are the ones who are making it possible to bring a 
new and happier rural life to the people of this county. 
Our men at the head of these schools are men of superior 
ability, college or normal trained. I am at this moment send- 
ing a letter to all my principals, written by one of them, a 
young man reared in Morgan County, trained in the Middle 
Tennessee State Normal, who, with his wife, lives in the simple 
little teacherage, a photograph of which is enclosed. This 
letter fairly runs over with enthusiasm as he tells of his work 
among these simple mountain people. He tells in this letter 
how he visits and advises with his patrons on their farms, sug- 
gesting better methods where needed; how he has them meet 
together and discuss the problems of home and farm, and how 
he has the school grounds divided into plots and numbered 
and cared for by squads of pupils learning to cooperate and 
work together. Even the school rooms are kept clean in this 
way. 
The greatest drawback is the conception of some of the 
people of a school as a little house on a forsaken spot and a 
teacher that has passed the examination. Whenever they con- 
ceive of a school as a place to train boys and girls in the coun- 
try to make the most efficient farmers and home-makers and 
even to reach out and help the mothers and fathers to solve 
the problems in the home and on the farm, the better type of 
rural school will come. 
Clinton has issued $12,000 worth of school bonds and will 
double the size of its building next spring. Coal Creek has 
built an addition to its building this summer. 
We have one of the best county demonstrators and one of 
the best canning club organizers in the State.
-P-A-G-E-237
—228—~ 
All the consolidated schools have a good library. 
Glen Alpine, which was the first large brick consolidated 
school established and has one of the longest wagon routes, 
now runs without a bit of friction. It is the largest consoli- 
dated unit in the county, embracing a territory of about thirty- 
five square miles, and the attendance lacks only twenty-five 
pupils of being equal to the attendance of the school at the 
county seat. 
The attendance in the consolidated schools generally is very 
gratifying. : : 
I could write a volume on the situation up here, but you 
asked for short and’ explicit reports. I have already made this 
one too long. 
In conclusion, let me thank you heartily for your unquali- 
fied cooperation in working out the whole county problem in 
Anderson County. Also let me thank you for the services of 
Prof. J. B. Brown, who is one of the bravest and best field 
workers that any State ever had. 
We have our grumblers up here, iumerous enough; also our 
dissatisfied politicians and hoarders of wealth who begrudge 
every cent’s increase in tax. The situation is delicate, and the 
county is passing through the most critical period in its educa- 
tional history. A field has been gained from which it means 
death to recede, but which only men of clear, cool thought and 
trained, unbiased judgment can hold. May my county have 
the good fortune to be guided safely through the next few years 
that are to determine the destiny of its childhood. 
A. C, Duaers, 
County Superintendent. 
BENTON COUNTY. 
During the past two years we have only made one notable 
consolidation, that being at Pembroke. Three one-room shacks 
were abandoned and a splendid, frame building erected to ac- 
commodate the pupils of the three communities. Transporta-
-P-A-G-E-238
—229— 
tion is being provided for one of the communities. This con- 
solidation is quite successful. 
The work of building has received considerable impetus, as 
evidenced by the fact that the school property of the county 
is worth, in round numbers, three times what it was two years 
ago. This increase in value is represented by the modern, brick 
buildings at Camden and Big Sandy, the consolidated building 
mentioned above, and five excellent one-room frame buildings, 
replacing as many log houses where consolidation seemed im- 
possible. This report takes into consideration only the work 
that has been completed, two other consolidations having been 
effected, but the work is not completed. 
The city of Camden issued bonds in the sum of $20,000.00 
to build its house. 
Twenty libraries have been established in the schools of 
the county during the past two years. 
We have established county high schools instead of the sec- 
ondary. These schools are proving quite successful. 
E. J. Crement, 
County Superintendent. 
BLEDSOE COUNTY. 
In submitting my annual report I desire to add the fol- 
lowing: When T became superintendent four years ago we had 
only one teacher who had any special teacher training. This 
year about 75 per cent of our teachers have some normal train- 
ing, and we are haying the best schools ‘in the history of our 
county. Our teachers are full of enthusiasm and are doing 
most excellent work. Four years ago when I began to agitate 
for consolidated schools the only newspaper in the county 
jumped on me furiously. I bought the paper in self-defense 
and now the tide has turned and all over the county the people 
are talking consolidation. At two places the people are now 
raising $3,000 funds to erect good buildings, which we hope 
to erect within the next few months. The sentiment for longer 
terms is growing and I think we shall have no trouble to get
-P-A-G-E-239
—230— 
an increased tax levy at our January term of court. Our 
teachers have raised hundreds of dollars to buy patent desks 
and other school equipment. Within a short time practically 
every school house in the county will have the best desks and 
the county will be out only half the expense. We are also 
replacing our delapidated mountain school buildings with new 
ones. This year we have built three new houses and the fourth 
is now ready to be built. In each instance the people have 
donated liberally money, timber, hauling, work, ete. 
We feel that Bledsoe County is making rapid strides edu- 
cationally and now that the sentiment for better things pre- 
yvails we should have smooth sailing and make much progress. 
Jno. M. Gerren, 
County Superintendent. 
  
BLOUNT COUNTY. 
We have built three consolidated school buildings during 
the past year. These buildings were each located on four acres 
of level land, and are modern as to equipment, lighting, heat- 
ing, desks and blackboards. 
The slogan of Blount County has been “A library in every 
school.” While we have not yet realized this slogan, we have 
placed $813.30 worth of good books in our schools during the 
past year. These funds have been raised by box suppers, socials 
or short programs rendered by the school. 
In addition to the libraries, a number of the teachers and 
patrons of the school have been interested in securing musical 
jnstruments for the school. As a result of these efforts pianos 
have been placed in the Wildwood, Friendsville and Walland 
schools; organs at Cades Cove and Rocky Branch. 
We have organized a county teachers’ association, which 
meets monthly at the court house. This association has started 
a teachers’ library of professional books for the teacher. 
The Girls’ Canning Club, or home demonstration work, hag 
been organized three years in Blount County, with splendid 
results. Many girls have earned good sums of money during 
the summer vacation.
-P-A-G-E-240

A campaign was carried on this fall for better schools. 
President Gilbreath, Prof. H. L. Ellis of Maryville College, 
Hon. Sam Hill, Hon. J. C. Ford, Hon Sam Johnson, and many 
local speakers rendered valuable aid. The campaign was con- 
ducted in the interest of better schools, better equipment, 
longer terms, better teachers and a closer relation of the school 
to the home, and other subjects that would tend to interest 
the people for better conditions for the children. 
Nancy Lez Broapy, 
County Superintendent. 
BRADLEY COUNTY. 
We have built up in Bradley County six social centers. 
These centers are consolidated with the schools near them. 
Two school wagons are now in operation. These buildings are 
yery modern in structure and adequate in room. Two issues 
of bonds have been made for the purpose of erecting new build- 
ings. Each issue was for $10,000.00. 
The County Supervisors have made much progress, and the 
following is a summary of the work done by our farm agent 
and our county home demonstration agent:

The girls’ gardens contain one-tenth of an acre each. We 
have given instruction in the preparation of seed beds, the
-P-A-G-E-241
—232— 
fertilization of plots, the cultivation of the plants, and the 
handling of crops, as given through circulars and bulletins sent 
from the United States Department of Agriculture and the 
Division of Extension. Active teachers are using the knowl- 
edge and experience of boys and girls gained on their plots for 
material in preparing lessons in language, in natural science, 
in drawing, and in mathematics. 
A closer relation between the city and country folks has 
been brought about by these canning and poultry clubs. The 
people appreciate the effort of the clubs in the country to fur- 
nish a supply of good, wholesome food, and the boys and girls 
appreciate the cooperation of the bankers, merchants and in- 
dividuals who are so generous with their. prizes at the annual 
exhibit. 
The girls are aiding the mothers to fill the pantry with fruits 
and vegetables which have hitherto gone to waste. When the 
fruit is all put away, and the winter months are on, we learn 
the best methods for preparing the dishes which are suitable ~ 
to be served for breakfast, dinner and supper. In addition to 
the preparation of the dishes we are teaching something of the 
source of the different foods and their nutritive value. 
A number of libraries have been established, and every 
school in the county now has a library except two. The at- 
tendance during the past year shows an increase under the 
new compulsory law. As a whole, much progress has been 
shown in the school work during the past year. 
. Sam Y. Ancocx, 
County Superintendent. 
CAMPBELL COUNTY. 
Although Campbell County has not made the progress that 
some of the counties have, yet a good educational spirit ig 
rapidly developing and important steps have been made in the 
past two years. 
A large consolidated school has been established at New- 
comb with six teachers, this consolidation doing away with
-P-A-G-E-242
—233— 
one small one-room school. A school wagon hag been furnished 
by the State to carry the pupils of this school to Newcomb. 
We have made additions to two of our large schools so 
that domestic science might be introduced. We now have five 
- elementary schools where there are regular domestic science 
teachers, and expect within another year to have at least fifteen 
schools of this character. 
The County Court at its January, 1916, session voted $60,- 
000 for elementary school buildings and $40,600 for high school 
buildings, but unfortunately these bond issues have been en- 
joined, but there is no question but that sooner or later the 
cause of better buildings will win out. . 
Twenty-four libraries have been established in the past 
two years at an approximate cost of $1,500. 
We are planning and hoping to have a supervisor for the 
near future, just as we now have the agricultural demonstra- 
tor and the canning club agent. 
In conclusion, the best thing that has been done in the 
county for the past two years is the establishment of an 
annual county school fair. There has been nothing that has 
aroused the educational interest so much as this school fair. 
Jon JENNINGS, 
County Superintendent. 
  
CANNON COUNTY. 
We made one consolidation for the year 1915. We put three 
one-teacher schools into one. The building was approved by the 
State Rural School Agent, Professor Brown. We put a wagon 
on at a cost of twenty dollars ($20.00) per month, which proved 
very satisfactory. We built a one-teacher school house at a 
cost of six hundred and fifty dollars ($650.00), the patrons 
hauling and furnishing the rough material and we paid the 
contractor. No school bonds were issued. We had no super- 
visor until the present term of school. Two new libraries were 
established—one at Readyville, the other at Pleasant Ridge 
School. The attendance increased about 15 per cent last year.
-P-A-G-E-243
—284— 
This year it has increased about 33 1-8 per cent. There has 
been more interest manifested since we put on a supervisor 
than ever before. We had a school fair this year, which sur- 
passed our expectations. " Mothers’ Clubs are being organized. 
in all parts of the county, and before the close of this school 
year we are going to have at least five junior high schools 
located in different parts of the county. 
W. iH. Fintey, 
County Superintendent. 
  
CARROLL COUNTY. 
During the past two years only two important consolida- 
tions were made. A handsome six thousand dollar brick build- 
ing at Clarksburg takes the place of two one-teacher schools 
and one two-teacher school with an aggregate enrollment of 
two hundred pupils. We have seven acres of land with this 
building very suitable for agricultural demonstration work. 
Three transportation wagons are being used here bringing chil- 
dren from two to five miles. The average haul is somewhere 
near fifty. 
We were very fortunate in securing Prof. W. Claud Hall 
as principal of this school. Both management and progress 
are very satisfactory. 
Our other consolidation was at such a location as not to 
need transportation. Our county has provided for the accom- 
modation of those who ride or drive to this school by building 
sheds and stalls to protect their horses and vehicles. 
The county and State together have raised and given for 
library purposes during the past two years something near 
five hundred dollars. We now have fifty-four new libraries 
and supplements, together comprising more than three thou- 
sand volumes. By reading and rereading, some ten thousand 
volumes must have been read during the past year. As a rule 
interest and progress is much more satisfactory in the schools 
which have well-used libraries. 
D. T. BarnuiLn, 
County Superintendent.

CARTER COUNTY. 
The educational conditions of Carter County are better than 
ever before. We are getting an educational sentiment aroused 
in the county that promises good results. : 
A strong sentiment for consolidation is growing all over 
the county. We have abandoned this year four one-room school 
buildings. A modern four-room building is to take their place. 
We are now paying our teachers according to their scholar- 
ship and experience. 
Out of about eighty-eight teachers employed in the county 
this year sixty-eight of them attended the East Tennessee State 
Normal School during the regular and summer session, and 
we hope to have a large number enrolled next year. 
Taking everything into consideration the school outlook in 
Carter County is very encouraging. 
‘J. R. Rircui, 
County Superintendent. 
CHESTER COUNTY. 
I have the honor to forward herewith my annual report as 
Superintendent of Hducation of Chester County, for the year 
ending June 80, 1916. We have had a better attendance the 
past year than we had the year before. Our teachers are be- 
coming better prepared to do better work, and a better interest. 
is manifested in the work in all our schools, by teachers, stu- 
dents and patrons. We had five months last year, and I think 
our court is going to levy a tax sufficient to run six months 
after this year. 
Our high school has done a splendid work the past year and 
the prospects are very bright for the coming year. This school 
has run only three years, and there will be a class of about 
thirty-five completing the high school course next year. The 
outlook is bright for both county and high schools. 
J. W. Stewart, 
County Superintendent.

COCKE COUNTY. 
A lack of funds during the years of 1915-1916 has greatly 
retarded consolidation and transportation progress in Cocke 
County. . However, in 1915, a most excellent consolidation of 
one two-teacher and three one-teacher schools was made at 
Bybee, a small village on the Newport-Morristown pike seven 
miles from Newport. The new building consists of four stand- 
ardized class rooms, cloak, library and music room, and an 
auditorium capable of seating four hundred persons. The 
building is heated with Smith system heaters. There are four 
teachers employed and work in all the eight grades. Our 
transportation wagon is operated for this school. 
In the last few years several consolidations of two schools 
have been made, but the Bybee School is the first of the school 
center type. Since the erection of the Bybee Consolidated 
School Building, which was dedicated in the presence of three 
thousand people, a heavy demand has been made for several 
other such schools in many sections of the county. As soon 
as funds are available at-least a half dozen such schools will 
be built. . 
No consolidations whatever of elementary schools were made 
“in 1916, the board using all funds to bring the school term up 
to six months. 
In Cocke County, since 1912, all new buildings have been 
constructed on a scientific plan, having adequate light and ven- 
- tilation and standardized class rooms. This plan has been 
carried out in even the one-room school. 
From year to year our teachers have raised funds in several 
schools for libraries until the number has reached about thirty, 
each library ranging in price from $20 to $90. 
The High School Board, through the County Court, has 
arranged for the consolidation of the three present high schools, 
located at Newport, Edwina and Parrottsville, into a large 
central county high school located at Newport. 
Thirty-six thousand five hundred dollars of school bonds 
have been sold for provision of the new school and site. The 
site has been purchased and consists of sixteen acres of tillable 
lands, located one-fourth mile from the court house.
-P-A-G-E-246
—237— 
The new school will be one of the first class, having espe- 
cially strong agriculture, home economics and manual training 
departments. The school will open in September, 1917. 
O. L. McManan, 
County Superintendent. 
COFFEE COUNTY. 
During the past two years much interest has been centered 
in the work of school consolidation. While we had consolidated 
several schools for two or three years prior to these, we have 
discontinued six schools within the past two years and have 
placed four extra school wagons, making a total of nine run- 
ning now in Coffee County. We have nine schools besides the 
Coffee County High School that take two years of high school 
work each. In these schools there are a total of twenty-six 
teachers and the influence of these schools is being felt. Our 
common school tax is sixty-five cents, and high school fifteen 
cents, both of which have been increased within the past 
two years. Never before have our schools experienced such 
progress. J.G. WaRDEN, — 
County Superintendent. 
  
CROCKETT COUNTY. 
We have worked earnestly for the consolidation of the three 
white schools of the Thirteenth Civil District into one central 
school, but have not perfected the plan. We have also worked. 
for a central school in the third district, but this has not ma- 
terialized. We succeeded in combining the two one-teacher 
schools in District No. 2 into one two-teacher school. We hope 
to make this a three-teacher school. This is all that has been 
accomplished in the past school year in the way of consolida- 
tion. oO 
No new buildings have been erected during the year, except 
additions to some of the already erected buildings,
-P-A-G-E-247
—238— 
There have been no bonds issued for school purposes. 
We have no county supervisors. 
Several schools added libraries during school year 1915-16. 
Our schools showed a small increase in attendance over pre- 
ceding year. T. I. Lowry, 
County Superintendent. 
DECATUR COUNTY. 
Decatur County has consolidated two schools in the last 
two years, without expense to the State or county. A dozen 
other such consolidations can be made in this county with a 
County Board of Education in sympathy with the movement. 
We have a school for every five and one-half square miles 
of territory in the county, causing our funds and energies to 
be so scattered that the school work must be very inefficient. 
Two libraries have been placed in the county in the past 
two years. P. H. Murery, 
County Superintendent. 
  
DEKALB COUNTY. 
Before Dekalb County can hope to be what she should be in 
an educational way we must have better roads, our streams 
bridged, more money, fewer school houses, and a longer school 
term. No county can have an educated citizenship with only 
a four months’ school term. 
The people of Dekalb County are waking up on the good 
roads question and several miles of pike have been built the 
past two years. 
We are erecting a beautiful and commodious stone high 
school building at Liberty, and have consolidated one school 
with the Liberty High School and hope to have the building 
complete and ready to open school December 1. 
For two years we have enforced the compulsory school law, 
and the records show the per cent of attendance in Dekalb
-P-A-G-E-248
—239— 
County greater than any county in Tennessee, and I think will 
show a greater per cent can read and write than any county 
in the State. 
Aside from consolidating one school with Liberty High 
School, we have discontinued one other and will consolidate 
two more schools another year. 
Our ery should be, “Good roads, consolidation, more money, 
and a longer school term.” When we get these things, I better 
trained teachers will come as a result. 
J. F. Captincer, 
County Superintendent. 
  
DICKSON COUNTY. 
Comparing the schools of Dickson County today with those 
of several years ago, we must say that we are progressing 
some. While we realize that consolidation is very much needed 
in Dickson County, yet we have not been able to accomplish 
as much in this way as we would like. One reason is because 
we have no special fund with which to erect new buildings, and 
another is that our people are not sufficiently aroused to donate 
enough to erect the buildings needed. 
We are using a supervisor this year for the first time, and 
are expecting good results from same. 
While we have placed libraries in about half of our school 
houses, at some places said libraries have been supplemented 
more than once, yet we do not expect to stop this work till we 
get a library in every school room in the county. 
R. &. Cortew, 
County Superintendent. 
DYER COUNTY. 
During the last year the King School, two miles south of 
Trimble, has been consolidated with the Trimble School. One 
wagon has been sufficient to trausport those who liyed too far
-P-A-G-E-249
—240— 
to walk. This consolidation has been worth a great deal to the 
pupils of the King School community, bringing them out of a 
one-room school, where one teacher was trying to do six or 
seven grades of work, and putting them into a graded school, 
where there is an experienced teacher for each grade. 
The town of Newbern issued bonds and erected a nice, mod- 
ern high school building at a cost of $25,000.00. 
Dyer County has added one-room additions to four build- 
jngs in the county, and has (by the aid of the Rosenwald Fund) 
erected an up-to-date one-teacher school for the negroes at 
Trimble. 
Dyer County established eleven new public school libraries 
last year and six the year before, making seventeen for the 
two years and thirty-one public school libraries in all in the 
county. Including the aid furnished by the State, Dyer County 
has spent within the last two years $1,122.55 for public school 
libraries. 
Our County Court at its July term voted an additional 
ten-cent school tax, making in all, sixty-five cents elementary 
and fifteen cents high school tax. Our county has put on both 
a county farm demonstrator and a lady collaborator. We are 
hoping that within the near future the county superintendent 
will be paid a salary sufficient to justify his giving all his time 
to the duties of the office, and that the county board system 
will be established. . R. M. Grins, 
County Superintendent. 
  
FAYETTE COUNTY. 
During the biennial period ending June 30, 1916, we have 
made in Fayette County but one consolidation, but this was 
a notable one. Three negro schools were consolidated into 
Fayette County Training School. With the aid of the negroes 
and the various boards interested a large, modern school build- 
ing was erected at a cost of over $5,000.00. The new school 
employs five well-equipped teachers, and through its influence 
we hope to raise the efficiency of the colored teachers of the
-P-A-G-E-250
Be —241— 
county. We have just added one month to the term of the ele- 
mentary schools for colored children. 
The transportation in our consolidated schools is rather 
expensive and not altogether satisfactory, but the school effi- 
ciency is very much greater, 
Our schools were almost all supplied with libraries three 
years ago, so during the two years we have ordered only sixteen 
libraries. 
At a recent meeting Fayette County Board of Education 
passed a resolution that in future it would elect no new teacher 
who was not at least the holder of an academic certificate from 
a state normal, or who has not at least one full year’s college 
work in addition to the four-year high school course. This 
should soon give us more mature and better equipped teachers. 
D. K. Donneiy, 
County Superintendent. 
  
FENTRESS COUNTY. 
We have erected three new buildings during the past year, 
two of which are one-room rural school buildings and one a 
four-room frame building, costing about $2,000.00 when fin- 
ished. 
We have established three new libraries in the county, mak- 
ing a total of fifty-four, which is near the entire number of 
schools in the county. 
The attendance for the past year has been the best per cent 
in years, and if the so-called compulsory attendance law was 
such that it could be enforced in this county the attendance 
could be bettered considerably. 
W. E. Muuiinrx, 
County Superintendent. 
  
FRANKLIN COUNTY. 
Franklin County is one of the few counties of the State that 
is still under the “old director system,” which system makes 
consolidation almost, if not entirely, impossible. That hag
-P-A-G-E-251
—242— 
been the case at least in Franklin County. The county has 
eighty-two schools and it should not have over fifty. Last fall 
the people voted a $350,000 bond issue for good roads and those 
roads are now under construction. When they are completed 
a number of schools can easily be consolidated. 
One or two school buildings have been constructed in the 
county each year. They have usually been planned with due 
consideration for ventilation, sanitation, etc., but no real first- 
class consolidated school has been maintained. . 
A general campaign for the establishment of libraries has 
been carried on for the past two years and many new libraries 
have been established and many old ones have been supple- 
mented. 
The attendance has been only reasonably good. Five thou- 
sand two hundred and thirty-six were enrolled during 1915-16. 
The daily attendance during the same period was three thou- 
sand four hundred and forty. <A bill was introduced by the 
representative of the county during the last legislature to ex- 
tend and make more binding the compulsory school law, but it 
only passed two readings in the Senate, by oversight. 
Austin W. Smita, 
County Superintendent. 
  
GILES COUNTY. 
We have consolidated seven small schools into two large 
ones. In the first case three schools were united in one central 
school with a four thousand five hundred dollar building and 
equipment. So great has been the success of this school that 
it became necessary to build an annex to this building at a 
cost of two thousand dollars, and two additional acres of land 
have been donated to this school for playground and agricul- 
tural purposes. 
The second consolidation of four schools has just recently 
been made. We have secured a beautiful site of five acres, on 
which we are going to erect a modern brick building for the
-P-A-G-E-252
—243— 
school and one acre on which we will erect a home for the 
principal. 
We have established through State aid twenty-five school 
libraries and have in addition twenty-five county circulating 
libraries and six State circulating libraries. 
Our tax levy for elementary schools at the January term 
of court was increased from ten cents to thirty-five cents, which 
gives us a total elementary tax levy of fifty cents. This insures 
Giles County an eight months public school term with better 
paid and better equipped teachers. 
B. H. Gauvryey, 
County Superintendent. 
  
GRAINGER COUNTY. 
The school work in Grainger County has been steadily pro- 
gressing during the past four years. Our school term has been 
lengthened from 95 days to 110 days. Our elementary 
school levy has been increased from forty cents to fifty-five 
cents, which includes five cents for better school buildings. 
And our teachers are receiving cash this year at the close of 
their first and second months’ work because the county is edu- 
eationally in a better financial condition than it has been in 
years. We have a fifteen-cent levy for high schools, and the 
first high school ever operated in the county is just now open- 
ing at Rutledge. A second high school will soon begin at 
Washburn. And this is not all the progress we have made 
during the past four years. 
The best school building in the county was erected last 
year at Liberty Hill. It is a modern three-room consolidated 
school with plenty of cloak rooms and porticoes. We plan 
to complete this year in the Tampico-Buffalo-Dodson commun- 
ity even a better school building than the one at Liberty Hill, 
because the people are offering more money to secure its erec- 
tion. This will be at least a three-teacher school building 
costing more than $3,000.00. Other communities are wanting 
consolidated schools as soon as the county board is able to 
help them,
-P-A-G-E-253
—244— 
President Gilbreath’s addresses last fall during our county 
educational campaign for consolidated schools are responded 
to by the five-cent levy by the County Court for this purpose 
and by the demands of the people for better school buildings. 
We are beginning to realize the dawn of a new day in Grainger 
County. W. M. Connry, 
County Superintendent. 
HAMBLEN COUNTY. 
There has been more progress made along educational lines 
in Hamblen County during the past two years than ever before 
in the history of the county. The people have realized as never 
before the necessity of giving their boys and girls better oppor- 
tunities for obtaining an education. 
There have been more schools consolidated during the last 
two years than ever before in such a short period of time. 
Realizing that much better work can be done in a consolidated 
school than in a one-room school, the people all over the coun- 
ty have taken a great deal of interest in the consolidation 
movement. The work that is being done in the consolidated - 
schools is far superior to that which is done in the weak one- 
room schools. 
We have erected four consolidated buildings valued at about 
$80,000.00. We received $800.00 from the State, the Board of 
Education furnished about $5,000.00, and the people of the 
different sections of the county where the buildings were erected 
furnished the balance. The buildings are modern in etery 
respect. They are built to meet the demands of the people 
during future years. They are well equipped in every particu- 
lar, having fine heating systems, fine desks and auditorium 
chairs. : : 
T think the time is not far distant when we shall have good 
consolidated schools all over Hamblen County, and then the 
boys and girls of the country will have equal opportunities 
with the boys and girls of the town. 
We have established more than twenty new libraries in the
-P-A-G-E-254
—245— 
last two years. We now have a good library in every school in 
the county. The books that we have in the rural schools are 
valued at more than $4,000.00. The teachers, patrons and 
pupils are being greatly benefited by reading the library books. 
By furnishing the boys and girls good rural life literature to 
read, they will stay in the country rather than move to town. 
We have put on two new school wagons. The wagons are 
being used to haul the pupils from weak one-room schools to 
good consolidated schools where they have better advantages 
in every respect. I believe the school wagon is one of the great- 
est factors in solying the consolidation problem. 
. The attendance has wonderfully increased in the county. 
The advantages are so much better than they have been here- 
tofore that it is not difficult to get the children in school. The 
attendance problem is not hard to solve when better oppor- 
tunities are given the boys and girls. 
The time has been when some of the teachers in the county 
had to have temporary certificates, but that time has passed. 
Every teacher in the county holds a legal certificate which — 
shows a higher standard of efficiency on the part of the teacher. 
Almost all the teachers have attended the East Tennessee State 
Normal School, thereby increasing their efficiency as true rural 
school teachers. J think the normal school has done more to 
raise the standard of teaching in East Tennessee than any 
other one thing. 
Poultry Clubs, Corn Clubs and Mothers’ Clubs have been 
organized in the different sections of the county. Country life 
has been more satisfying since these clubs were organized. 
The people have realized that there is work to be done at the 
school houses other than textbook work. The boys and girls 
are being educated for efficiency more than ever before. They 
are putting into actual practice those things which they will 
have to do when they leave the school. 
I have mentioned some of the things that we have been 
able to accomplish during the last two years. We intend to - 
try to do more in the future than we have in the past to have 
Hamblen County rank among the best counties of Tennessee in 
having a fine educational.system; and there is no reason why
-P-A-G-E-255
—245— 
we should not, as we have a fine agricultural county, a fine, pro- 
gressive town and one of the finest pike road systems in the 
State of Tennessee. W. S. Ivy, 
County Superintendent. 
HAMILTON COUNTY. 
School conditions in Hamilton County have shown marked 
improvement in the past two years. Enrollment in the various 
schools is increasing steadily, attendance is becoming more 
regular, and the work of the teachers more efficient. Interest 
on the part of parents as evidenced by educational gatherings, 
parents’ meetings, and improvement league work is very grati- 
fying indeed. 
Our greatest problem is the one of providing accommoda- 
tions for the children. New buildings erected with a view to 
meeting the demands of their respective communities for years 
to come are already full to overfiowing. The proceeds from a 
bond issue of $228,000.00 have just been expended in the erec- 
tion and enlargement of grammar school buildings in this 
county. Fourteen new brick buildings have been erected, five 
enlarged and improved, and every building in the county thor- 
oughly overhauled and repaired within the last year. And 
even yet, in some of our large suburban schools we are forced 
to rent outside rooms to take care of overflow classes. 
The standard of teaching efficiency is being raised from 
year te year. Applicants for positions as teachers in our 
county grammar schools must now have at least a high school 
education together with some professional training. Literary 
teachers in our county high schools must hold college or uni- 
versity degrees. 
Hamilton County, together with the city of Chattanooga, 
maintains a Summer School for Teachers, which school is con-- 
ducted under the auspices of the University of Chattanooga. 
Last year the enrollment was 415. A number of teachers from 
other counties were in attendance, together with a goodly num- 
ber from other States. Hamilton County teachers were en-
-P-A-G-E-256
—2A7— 
rolled in each of our State normal schools, Peabody, Columbia 
University, the University of Chicago, and other leading pro- 
fessional schools. 
Of the fifty-five colored teachers employed in this county, 
forty-nine attended the Agricultural and Industrial Summer 
School at Nashville last summer. 
A grammar school supervisor and a collaborator of girls’ 
club work and a home-makers’ club agent for colored schools 
have been employed and are doing excellent service. They, 
together with the Superintendent, the probation officer and 
farm demonstration agent, constitute the supervisory staff of 
our county schools. 
Progress has been made along the lines of consolidation and 
transportation. Two one-room schools were discontinued last 
year and the pupils transported to larger schools. Six gram- 
mar school and four high school transportation wagons are 
now in operation. This policy is proving very popular and 
will be continued along more extensive lines next year. 
Growth and extension of library work in Hamilton County , 
for the past two years has been very satisfactory. We now 
have in the county schools, one teachers’ library, twenty-eight 
circulating school libraries, and fifty-five permanent school 
libraries, numbering in all 4,675 volumes. 
Our greatest accomplishment along this line, however, has 
been the enlargement of the work of Chattanooga Carnegie 
Library to the extent that it now maintains a branch library 
of some 600 volumes in each of our four rural high schools 
and one rural grammar school. It also furnishes fifteen gram- 
mar schools with supplementary readers for the first, second 
and third grades, numbering last year 1,244 volumes. The total 
circulation of this branch of the work alone last year was 
26,704 volumes. 
In addition to the above, some 85,000 volumes were read 
by pupils and patrons of the county schools from the Central 
Library at Chattanooga. : 
Each of our four rural high schools offers a course in scien- 
tifie agriculture. Practical demonstrations are made on the 
school demonstration plots and on neighboring farms. Boys’
-P-A-G-E-257
—248—- 
Corn Clubs, Pig Clubs and Poultry Clubs have been organized. 
This department is operating in accordance with the provisions 
of the Smith-Lever Bill. 
Clubs have also been organized in many of our rural granr- 
mar schools. 
Courses in manual training are given in both our Central 
High School and the Lincoln (colored) High School. Wood- 
working, mechanical drawing, blacksmithing, etc., are included 
in this course. A printing press has been installed at Central 
High School. The school paper is printed on this press. The 
work igs done by pupils of the school. It is our purpose to 
gradually extend this work to the sixth, seventh and eighth 
grades of our larger grammar schools. 
Domestic science courses are given in each of our six high 
schools. Short courses are also given in a few of our grammar 
schools. This work will be extended as teachers and equipment 
can be supplied. 
‘A collaborator of girls’ club work for white pupils and a 
* home-makers’ club agent for colored pupils are employed to 
supervise and develop this work. They have organized and suc- 
cessfully directed the activities of thirty-two clubs, having a 
membership of 344 girls. Donations in the form of prizes and 
other contributions to the amount of more than $2,000.00 were 
collected last year. : 
It is the purpose of this work not only to teach the girls to 
can fruit and eare for poultry, but to aid in the conservation 
of the resources of the farm and fo realize more fully the 
possibilities of country life. J. L. Hair, 
County Superintendent. 
  
HARDEMAN COUNTY. 
So far we have not been able to do any real consolidation ; 
however, we have abandoned some two or three schools. We 
have two communities that are about to get ready for consolida- 
tion. We have held meetings in both sections of the county 
and I think we will succeed in getting a real consolidation 
within the next year.
-P-A-G-E-258
—249— 
Several new buildings have been erected in the past two 
years, most of which are framed two and three rooms. 
We have quite a number of libraries established in the 
county and new ones are being established, as well as new 
yolumes being added to the old ones. 
At the beginning of the schools for this year I had a school 
rally held in Bolivar, which worked up a great deal of interest 
in the schools. We offered a twenty-dollar donation for a 
library to the school making the best showing there that day, 
and a ten-dollar donation to the next best. Our crowd was 
estimated at 3,500, with banners flying and floats to represent 
their respective schools, Prof. J. W. Brister, President of the 
West Tennessee Normal, was the principal speaker. He made 
quite an interesting and instructive speech along the lines of 
cobperation and consolidation. As a result of the rally our 
schools opened with a good deal larger attendance this year 
than ever before. 
Our school fair in connec tion with the county Live Stock 
and Agricultural Fair is doing a great deal toward creating 
an interest in school work throughout the county. 
Joun D, Turntr, 
County Superintendent. 
  
HARDIN COUNTY. 
Although Hardin County has a tax rate of sixty cents on 
the $100, a four months’ school term is the best that can be 
done. This is caused by the abnormally low assessed. valuation. 
The land and other property are assessed at not more than 30 
per cent of their actual cash value. When this is rectified we 
can have a six months’ school or better. 
Though we have only four months of school, our schools 
are doing excellent work. Our enrollment and attendance are 
much better than the average of the State. The number of 
pupils above the fifth grade is as high in proportion as that 
of the entire State. : 
Hardin County is just beginning to build a system of good
-P-A-G-E-259
—250— 
roads. This will hasten consolidation. A consolidated school 
building is now being erected at a place in the county where 
two schools had heretofore been used. Four acres of gently 
rolling upland were secured for a building lot. The building 
is along new lines as to the lighting and general arrangement. 
We need a bond issue for building school houses.- A dozen 
places in the county are virtually out of doors. At present, 
however, we should be very careful where we erect our houses, 
because they should be located where they can be reached by 
our good roads. c. A. Lows, 
County Superintendent. 
HENDERSON COUNTY. 
In Henderson County we have not taken up the matter of 
consolidation by transportation. We have not felt that it is 
a practical idea for a county where the roads are so poor as 
they are in this county, and especially since we have so little 
school funds for defraying the necessary expenses. We have 
done some consolidation on a smaller scale during the last 
two years. In seven instances we have put.two or more one- 
teacher schools into a single school with marked success. At 
Shady Hill we put two small schools into one. The two when 
run alone were barely able to keep above the required average 
of fifteen pupils, one of them falling below that requirement 
at times. We had to employ a third teacher for this summer 
to accommodate the school. The same is true at Cedar Grove 
School. There has not been a failure to increase the interest 
at any place where schools have been consolidated. 
We have established quite a number of school libraries dur- 
ing the past two years, and all are pleased with the help derived. 
from the presence of a library in the school. There has not 
been as much activity in this line as might have been. 
W. H. Denison, 
County Superintendent.
-P-A-G-E-260
—251— 
HOUSTON COUNTY. 
In the past two years we have consolidated two schools, 
and the location is such that we need no school wagons for 
transportation. 
We have erected three new buildings—a one-room, a two- 
room, and one for the consolidation. 
The attendance is not what it should be, due to lack of 
help in supervision. The County Court wants (?) to save 
the funds. D. J. McAutay, 
County Superintendent. 
HUMPHREYS COUNTY. 
Complying with your request for a report of the educational 
progress of Humphreys County during the past two years, I 
submit the following: 
We have done but little in the way of consolidation during 
the past two years. The schools of Johnsonville and Denver 
have been consolidated, an up-to-date three-room school house 
having been erected midway between the two villages. This 
school is doing splendid work. Material is on the ground for 
a modern consolidated school building near Bakerville. In the 
erection of this building the instruction of the State authorities 
will be closely followed. Application for State aid has been 
made for this building. We have just completed a splendid two- 
room school building for the colored people near Waverly at 
a cost of about $1,200.00. 
There have been erected in this county during the past two 
years six one-room school buildings, at a cost of about $800.00 
each. These houses have all been supplied with patent desks. 
Almost all our schools now have desks. 
We have had no school bonds issued, but we have a special 
levy for a building fund. We have used none of the general 
school fund for building and furnishing school houses since 
T have been County Superintendent. Before this all the build- 
ing and furnishing have been at the expense of the general 
school fand,
-P-A-G-E-261
—252— 
We have no public transportation, but expect to have in 
the near future. 
While we at present have no county supervisor, we have 
the promise of one after the present term. I consider this one 
of our great needs.. 
Twelve new libraries have been established during the past 
two years, and application for State aid for several others will 
be. made in a short time. 
While the attendance is not what it should be, it is much 
better than ever before. 
There have been many improvements made in Humphreys 
County during the past two years. Our county has just spent 
$250,000.00 on good roads. This will greatly aid in the con- 
solidation of our rural schools. We have a farm demonstrator 
who is coéperating with our teachers in the solution of our 
rural problems. I think this will result in much good. I have 
visited almost all the schools of the county during the past few 
weeks and I found better attendance, the patrons more inter- 
ested and the teachers doing better work than ever before. 
The school property of Humphreys County has more than 
doubled in value during the last four years, and, as has been 
stated, this has not been at the expense of the general school 
fund. : 
While many improvements have been made, we have just 
made a start; we have many things yet to do; but Humphreys 
County is slowly but surely moving upward. 
G. W. McKeEszn, 
County Superintendent. 
JACKSON COUNTY. 
Progressive school matters mature slowly in Jackson Coun- 
ty. The County Court has refused so far to levy a high school 
tax. 
During the biennial period ending June 30, 1916, the ele- 
mentary schools of this county have made some material ad- 
vancement,
-P-A-G-E-262
—253— 
Our attendance is better and the grade of work by pupils 
and teachers is more satisfactory. 
We have made one consolidation and have an excellent 
school where we had two weak and poorly taught achools be- 
fore the consolidation. 
We have erected eight buildings, all frame. The people of 
the different communities have greatly aided us by furnishing 
the rough material on the ground. 
We have established twenty new libraries. 
A local act by the last legislature has greatly affected— 
almost riined—the compulsory school law for this county; yet 
the attendance is much better than it was before the compulsory 
law was enacted. W. L. Dixon, 
County Superintendent. 
JAMES COUNTY. 
In reply to your letter asking for a special report from this 
county, I will reply in giving as best I can a brief history of 
the work since I came into the office April, 1915. 
At that time the County Board of Hducation was letting 
the contract for building a school house at Birchwood. This 
house was to be built large enough to accommodate the chil- 
dren belonging to that school, One room was 60 x 40 feet, 
another 40 x 30 feet. It was built with three windows on a 
side, like all the old houses in the county, at a cost of over 
$1,000.00. This was a place to build a consolidated school, 
but I came into office too late to get such a thing last year. 
I had four rallies last year over the county, trying to arouse 
an interest in consolidation and succeeded in getting a great 
deal of interest along that line. I presented to the County 
Court in January resolutions asking for $25,000.00 in bonds to 
be used in erecting eight new buildings to take the place of 
the twenty one-room and two-room houses that we now have, 
but did not get it passed. I tried to get $30,000.00 in April, 
but failed. I have had some more rallies this year and have 
succeeded in getting so much interest aroused that I have the
-P-A-G-E-263
—25.4— 
promise of the bonds at the October term of court. I feel sure 
that we will get consolidation next year. 
We have a bond issue of $80,000.00 for roads this year. 
Last year we established three new libraries and added a 
number of volumes to the old libraries. 
On account of not having modern, sanitary buildings, 
we have no truant officer, but the teachers are doing excellent 
work in securing the attendance of the children. 
In short, the people of James County have the school spirit 
as never before. I am sure this county will come to the front 
in a short time and be one of the leading educational counties 
in East Tennessee. W. H. Roark, 
County Superintendent. 
JOHNSON COUNTY. 
The consolidation situation in Johnson County is on the 
forward move. However, the work is slow, but steady. We 
are building one consolidated building each year. The one just 
completed for the year 1915 is a one-story frame building, three 
large rooms so arranged by folding door partitions that they 
may be thrown into one large auditorium; also a large hall, an 
industrial room, and a library room, all built according to the 
State requirements. 
Twenty-five out of our forty-five schools have libraries. We 
have a number of organized parent-teachers’ associations, and 
it is telling in the social and moral life of the communities. 
Our motto for the year is, “A library and a parent-teachers’ 
association in every school of the county.” 
J. L. SaHoun, 
County Superintendent. 
  
KNOX COUNTY. 
During the past year Knox County has erected six new 
buildings at a cost of one hundred thousand dollars. 
One building takes the place of three small frame buildings
-P-A-G-E-264
—255— 
and is known as the Powell Consolidated School. We have 
two wagons to transport the pupils to this school. All of the 
new buildings are modern in construction, two story and 
basement with departments of domestic science and music. 
The buildings are equipped with steam heat, shower baths, 
drinking fountains, rest rooms, library, office and auditorium. 
The County Board borrowed the money at 5 per cent to run 
one, two, three and four years for our building fund, and the 
County Court levied a special tax of twelve cents to meet our 
obligation. This plan was endorsed by some of the largest tax 
payers of the county, and is considered better than twenty-year 
bonds. 
We have three supervisors—one for the schools, one for the 
girls’ clubs and one for the boys’ clubs. The work of. the 
supervisors has been very satisfactory and we consider that 
every county in the State should carry on the industrial work 
in some form. 
The library work in the county has been very satisfactory, 
as we had for our slogan two years ago, «A Library in Every 
School.” This we have accomplished and feel very proud of 
our record. 
Last year witnessed the first moonlight schools in the county 
and far surpassed the expectation of the superintendent in 
point of interest and attendance. We conducted four schools 
and enrolled more than 300 in all of the schools. We were 
assisted in the work by many ministers and a number of busi- 
ness men. Monrog W. WIzson, 
County Superintendent. 
LAUDERDALE COUNTY. 
Please find enclosed herewith my annual report. There is 
a slight falling off of my enrollment, caused mainly by several 
of the negro schools not running during the summer months. 
I am certain that the efficiency of our teachers, the class of 
work done and the general interest are improving each year. 
One new feature of our work last year was the rally day
-P-A-G-E-265
—256— 
opening. The parents were all urged to go with their children 
to school the first day and to be there on time. The teachers 
went into the communities one or two days ahead, and one or 
more visiting speakers were sent to each place. By comparing 
the attendance with openings in other years I found that it 
showed an increase of nearly 50 per cent. 
Consolidation continues te grow in numbers and popularity. 
This is one move that has never lagged or faltered the least 
since it was introduced. Still this county, having rivers on 
three sides, will always need several small schools. 
The very best wishes of Lauderdale County to the man of 
her choice. G. G. McLeop, 
‘County Superintendent. 
LAWRENCE COUNTY. 
There has never been as great an interest among the people 
along educational lines, especially among the people of the 
rural schools, as at the present time. Many demands are being 
made upon the County Board of Education for improvements, 
such as buildings and repairs, equipment and additional teach- 
ing force, which it is not financially able to grant. 
The attendance has been materially increased during the 
past two years, due in part to the attendance law. The board 
employs an attendance officer each year, but the results are 
not always satisfactory. 
I have held a number of educational rallies over the county 
from which much good has been realized. We have a strong 
County Teachers’ Association, and have had monthly meetings 
which are well attended, and have had a number of the mem- 
bers of the faculty of the Middle Tennessee State Normal with 
us during the past year to address the teachers. 
We have one first-class high school in Lawrence, which is 
‘serving as a great factor in giving to us a better and more 
efficient teaching force. There has been expended during the 
past two years, in addition to liberal donations by the com- 
munities, about $8,000.00 for permanent improvements, such
-P-A-G-E-266
257 
as the erection of three one-room buildings, one two-room build- 
ing, adding of rooms to two other buildings, and one four- 
room building, all of which have been erected on modern plans. 
We have been laboring for a number of years under difficul- 
ties on account of the lack of finances, but through the use of 
economic expenditures we have overcome this to some extent. 
At the beginning of the scholastic year, 1914, there was an 
overdraft of over $6,000.00, with cash on hand of about §$2,- 
000.00, but this has been eliminated and at the close of the 
year June 30, 1916, there was cash on hand to the amount of 
over $3,000.00, with ouistanding indebtedness of a little over 
$200.00. 
Lawrence County is at the head of the list in regard to tax 
levy for school purposes. She has been paying ninety cents on 
the $100.00 until the present year she is paying eighty-five 
cents—sixty-five cents for elementary schools, fifteen cents for 
high schools, and five cents for : a sinking fund on a bond issue 
for building purposes. 
We have one consolidated school and are running one school 
wagon, but under the present conditions, we are not able to 
have over a five months’ school term. One of the greatest needs 
in the county is more consolidation, but there is a strong senti- 
ment against it. The county has recently voted a good roads 
bond issue for $350,000.00, and it is hoped that this means an 
advance step towards consolidation. 
L. N. Lumpxins, 
County Superintendent. 
LEWIS COUNTY. 
Two of the school improvements advocated by our educa- 
tional reformers. have met with stern opposition in this county. 
Namely, the consolidation of schools and the establishment of 
high schools. However, there was evidence of a change in senti- 
ment regarding the high school proposition at the April term 
of our County Court, as the proposition to establish three high 
schools only lost by three, votes, and one of the opposition was 
—St. Rpt. 9
-P-A-G-E-267
—258— 
heard to regret later that he did not vote for the measure. 
Three efforts to consolidate schools have resulted in failure, 
and loss of money to the county. 
It is the decision of the Superintendent that public opinion 
will have to be changed to a degree before any great change in 
school conditions can be brought about; accordingly an effort 
is being made to get the teachers of the various schools into 
the homes and have them explain the advantages accruing from 
these needed reforms. 
Few counties in the State have their one-teacher school 
buildings in better shape than we, yet our people complain 
that the types advised by the Educational Department are not 
as good as the old styles. 
We have many wide-awake teachers. Nothing is more felt 
than the want of more efficiency on the part of some teachers. 
“Lewis County must have a longer school term” is our slogan 
for next year. - Joun A. WHITE, 
County Superintendent. 
LINCOLN COUNTY. 
Consolidation.—We are at work on two consolidated school 
buildings with promise of State aid. One is nearing completion 
at Kelso and will cost between $4,500.00 and $5,000.00. The 
other is at Delrose and is to be a two-story brick with a base- 
ment. It will be a very substantial building and will cost be- 
tween $7,000.00 and $8,000.00. 
Bonds issued, none. 
Work of County Supervisor—We have had one supervisor, 
who has looked after the industrial work and has assisted with 
the grade supervision. She has followed the plans outlined by 
Prof. S. L. Smith and has organized the canning, poultry and 
corn clubs. She has encouraged and assisted in making and 
demonstrated with fireless cookers, dustless mops, etc. She 
has assisted the elementary teachers with the organization and 
classification of their work and has won the confidence and 
esteem of all. Perhaps her greatest aid has been in helping to
-P-A-G-E-268
—259— 
put into operation the new system of schools in the county, 
providing for elementary, third, second and first-class high 
schools. 
Libraries.—We have established six new libraries during 
the year and have had excelent reports on the use of the fifty- 
seven libraries established heretofore. 
Jussp Harpin, 
County Superintendent. 
LOUDON COUNTY. 
During the past year we built two consolidated schools—one 
two-room, one three-room with good basement, hat racks, cloak 
room, etc. At each of these places the total attendance is in- 
creased and the general interest is doubled, and the educa- 
‘tional effect is more than doubled. 
We had an excellent summer institute at Loudon in July. 
It was conducted by Professors Barnes and Schoen of the East 
Tennessee State Normal. Our teachers greatly appreciated the 
valuable services of these gentlemen. 
One consolidated building will be built this fall in one of 
the best neighborhoods in the county. 
Joun T. HENDERSON, 
County Superintendent. 
  MACON COUNTY. 
Last year we took the initiative in consolidation, which met 
with much opposition. This year those schools are far superior 
to those that were discontinued. This school is not a typical 
school of the kind; however, the fire is kindled. The library 
work is continued with a marked degree of success. About 
70 per cent of our schools have libraries. We used for one year 
a “salary schedule,” based on attendance, in paying our teach- 
ers. This met- with criticism, but was a great stimulant and 
proved very effective in raising our attendance. Our teachers
-P-A-G-E-269
—260— 
are crying for better salaries and longer terms, while the public 
is demanding more efficient teachers and results from the 
schools. O. G. Davis, 
County Superintendent. 
MAURY COUNTY. 
Six schools, four white and two colored, have been aban- 
doned or consolidated with other schools. At one point—En- 
terprise—two small two-teacher schools were consolidated in 
a new school located at a central point. Near Columbia, a 
four-teacher colored school was consolidated with the City 
Colored School. . 
The County Board of Education has not transported any 
pupils at public expense, but in many schools the patrons fur- 
nish their own conveyances to send their children to school. 
During this period the county board.has invested $2,892.49 
in new buildings and sites. At Enterprise, mentioned above, 
the sum of $2,400.00 in money and several hundred dollars in 
work and hauling were expended in the erection of a three- 
room brick veneer building on a beautiful Jot containing four 
acres. 
The City of Columbia has expended $83,000.00—$75,000.00 
of which was raised by a bond issue—in the erection and equip- 
ment of a $66,000.00 Central High School Building which ac- 
commodates the county and city high school, in making an 
$11,000.00 addition to the Andrews Building which is occupied 
by the primary grades, and in building a $6,000.00 annex to 
the College Hill School, which is occupied by the colored chil- 
dren of the city and those of the Ninth District from the 
country. ‘ 
During the year 1915-16 the board employed a colored super- 
visor for the county. She visited nearly all the forty-four 
colored schools of the county and introduced industrial work. 
She did much to stimulate the colored people to take more .in- 
terest in their schools and improve the physical surroundings 
of the schools. At the close of the term the schools made an
-P-A-G-E-270
. —261-— 
exhibit of their work in the county court house, which, both in 
extent and quality, was very creditable. : 
Four new libraries were established and many old ones 
were supplemented. During the two years 1,455 volumes were 
added to the libraries in the schools. : 
Out of a school population of 11,843 there was a daily at- 
tendance of 6,118 pupils in the primary grades. If we should pa add to this the pipih,.n the two high schools and three or four 
private schools the number in daily attendance for a term of 
eight months would reach about 6,600, or a little more than 
55 per cent of the school population. 
Joun P, GragaM, 
County Superintendent. 
  
M’MINN COUNTY. 
The progress of the schools during the period I have served 
as County Superintendent has been very good along all lines. 
The educational work of this connty has passed into a new 
era. ‘This is due to having the cooperation of a well-qualified 
County Board of Education. which has worked up a good in- 
terest in the rural schools. We are having but little trouble 
with the compulsory school law. Our attendance has increased 
each year. This law has put the patrons to thinking of their 
children’s interest in the way of receiving an education. The 
uniform examination law has done a great deal to do away 
with the incompetent teachers. 
I have placed six libraries since I came into office, and I 
expect to use every effort to place one in every school in the 
county. cory 
The boys’ corn clubs and the girls’ canning clubs are meet- . 
ing with great success. Our largest yield of corn last year 
was 113 1-2 bushels per acre, by Carl McKeehan. Everybody 
is-well pleased with the work of the Supervisor, Mrs. J. A. 
Reagan. She is having splendid success in the county. Both. 
High School and County Boards of Education passed resolu- 
tions to go before the County Court at its October term to see
-P-A-G-E-271
—262— 
if we can secure forty thousand ($40,000.00) dollars worth of 
school bonds to be expended in building and equipping build- 
ings. We are making a fine start in the way of consolidation, 
and I hope to have things in better shape next year. The Cal- 
houn Consolidated High School building is going to be one of 
the finest and prettiest buildings in the county. 
V. C. McKunzin,

    tts 
WNAIRY COUNTY. 
We have no consolidated schools in this county for the rea- 
son that the roads are almost impassable in winter. However, 
we have six communities that are about ready for consolidation. 
We have erected seven new frame school buildings. All 
but two take the place of the poorest buildings in the county, 
one of which was an old log school house. Away with the log 
school houses in old McNairy. 
Fighteen public school libraries have been installed i in our 
schools during the past two years, costing about $320. Our 
teachers’ meetings for the past two years have worked. wonder- 
fully well in this county. A, H. GranrHamM, 
County Superintendent. 
  
MEIGS COUNTY. 
While school progress has not been very rapid in this county, 
still conditions are slowly improving. Owing to the bad roads, 
we have not been able to consolidate any of our schools. We 
are now building a system of roads which will greatly aid in 
the consolidation of many of our schools. The superior work 
being done in the-two-teacher schools is tending to mold public 
opinion for the consolidated school. 
A number of libraries have been established and several 
hundred books have been placed in the schools. The funds for 
this purpose have been raised by entertainments, box suppers, 
ete., where the libraries are desired,
-P-A-G-E-272
—263— 
The enrollment for the last year increased 10 per cent and - 
the average attendance increased 15 per cent. This seems to 
be encouraging, considering that the scholastic population in- 
creased only about 2 per cent. 
The county high school is doing good work and is being 
well patronized, but the County Court has badly crippled it by 
cutting the levy from fifteen cents to ten cents. Out of thirty- 
four teachers elected to the public schools this year, twenty- 
four have tlie equivalent of a high school education; none have 
Jess than one year’s work in the high school, and five have some 
normal training. This is, we think, one of the most encourag: 
ing signs for our county, and a great argument for improving 
the high school. 
We have had one or more rallies in each district during the 
school term. These rallies have been well attended, and the 
schools at the rally points have been greatly benefited. Besides 
these rallies, we have held a number of night meetings in com- 
munities not reached by the rallies. 
The county institute was a splendid success this year. The 
teaching force was composed of a number of strong instructors 
from over the State, and the session was well attended, not 
only by the teachers, but by the general public at well. 
Luter F. Ricz, 
County Superintendent. 
MONTGOMERY COUNTY. 
We have made no consolidation of schools within the past 
two years, with the exception of the two so-called “Community 
Center Schools.” These proved anything but a success. The 
law by which they were organized was declared unconstitu- 
tional by the Supreme Court, and that left us in-the same con- 
dition that we were year before last. 
We are running two wagons at Sango at the cost of $70.00 
a month for both. This has proven a success for the improve- 
ment of the school, but has not yet been reduced in expense,
-P-A-G-E-273
—264— 
where it could. be recommended from an economical standpoint. 
However, this objection may be overcome by the improvement 
of the roads. 
One building was erected by the Community Center Com- 
mittee. This building is spacious, but not otherwise commo- 
dious for school purposes, it having been constructed with 
little regard to heating, lighting or ventilating. 
We have had the assistance of a white and a colored super- 
visor for the past two years. We regard their help as the great- 
est modern improvement of country schools for their respective 
races. The country supervisor is the biggest factor making for 
efficiency in the management and the practical instruction in 
our rural schools. We had to try them to be convinced of the 
indispensable value of their services. 
With the most appreciated assistance of the State fund, we 
are organizing school libraries at the rate of from five to ten 
libraries a session. : 
Our attendance is not what it should be, with the proper 
cooperation of all parties concerned, but we shall continue to 
hustle to make it better. E. Buckner, 
: County Superintendent. 
MOORE COUNTY. 
The Moore County schools are making some progress under 
our handicapped system. 
Under our present management we are unable to consolidate 
schools to any advantage, or to give equal advantages to the 
students for completing the elementary school course. 
No new buildings have been erected during the year. 
No bond issue. 
No libraries have been established. 
The compulsory school attendance law is a dead letter un- 
der our system. 
A two days’ Teachers’ Conference was “tried out” this year.
-P-A-G-E-274

A series of school rallies were held in six two-teacher 
schools, August 15-18, inclusive. 
The purpose was to create interest in the schools and com- 
munities for better conditions in each. Those who assisted © 
in this work were Professors J. C. McAmis, J. B. Brown and 
L, 8. Smith, State department; Prof. R. G. Sanford, principal 
of high school; O. J. Tacket, teacher of agriculture in high 
school; Hon. J. J. Bean, chairman of high school board; 
B, Clay Middleton, editor of county paper, and the County 
Superintendent. 
We are attempting to standardize our schools by comply- 
ing with a given number of items—a list of forty-six—as to 
the condition of the school, and when a marked per cent has 
been attained the school is thus classed as a standard or su- 
perior school. 
We are advocating an eight months’ school term, that when 
a school does not run eight months the patrons are being urged 
to supplement the term to eight months. One rural school ray 
ten months last year on this plan. . 
A Moore County Parent-Teachers’ Association and Home- 
Makers’ Club was organized at our conference July 14-15. 
The teachers of the county and the County Superintendent 
compose the membership of this association and each teacher 
is expected to organize in his or her respective school and 
community, Then we affiliate with the community, county, 
State and National organizations. A few teachers have been 
able to effect an organization. 
A Moore County School and Community Fair will be held 
at the Moore County High School building on Saturday, Octo- 
ber 14. This will be the second; the’first was given in 1912. 
The Moore County High School serves a territory of one 
hundred and forty-five square miles, and is very progressive, 
with its cooperative faculty, student body and community. 
The Clark and Wilson Societies are conducting a campaign 
for securing new students in school. Each is working faith- 
fully to that end. 
The Home-School Association meets bi-monthly and is in- 
creasing in membership and interest. This organization did
-P-A-G-E-275

much in promoting school interest, both materially and spirit- 
ually, last school year, and promises to do greater things for 
this year. 
It has put on a free dental examination of all the children 
in school and is working to secure more favorable health con- 
ditions in many ways. Cora WISEMAN,

MORGAN COUNTY. 
Public sentiment on the question of consolidation of schools 
and transportation of pupils in this county has become so 
strong in the last three years that we have to put the brakes 
on to keep the matter from running away with the school fund. 
We have effected two consolidations, bringing four schools to 
one, and three to the other. A $50,000 brick building is being 
erected at one place, with provision for domestic science and 
‘manual training. This will be the first brick or stone building 
in the county and will open the way for more improvements 
in the near future. A $14,000 brick building is under contract 
at the other place of consolidation, and will be erected within 
the present school year. School bonds have not been issued, but 
we could use and ought to have $75,000 now for the purpose of 
buildings and grounds. Road bonds to the amount of $320,000 
have been used, making transportation of school pupils easier. 
We find that good roads and school transportation go hand in 
hand. 
Six libraries have been established within the last year, 
with over 600 books, and music instriments and song books 
have been placed in many schools by popular subscription. In 
a word, the school world in this county is making wonderful 
progress. J.N. JOHNSON, - 
County Superintendent. 
  
OBION COUNTY. 
One school has been abolished, another has suspended tem- 
porarily and the pupils are attending school at Union City.

Fire destroyed a poor building at Woodland Mills and now 
they have erected a fine three-room brick, have a good Parent- 
Teachers’ Association, a good library and a piano. A windstorm 
destroyed a moderate frame building at Oak Ridge. They have 
erected an up-to-date one-room frame building with due regard 
* to lighting and ventilation and cloak rooms. The town of 
Rives voted $10,000 bonds and erected a fine four-room brick. 
This building has also a principal’s room, a basement of four 
rooms and a good auditorium in the second story. Three small 
one-room buildings at Antioch, Minnick and Jones have been 
replaced by new buildings. Cunningham has built a large 
three-room frame building to replace a one-room building. Most 
of this money was private money. 
Rives issued $10,000 bonds to build and has built the build- 
ing described above. Union City has voted $25,000 of bonds 
to erect buildings. Five thousand dollars of this will be used 
for a building for the colored people. In addition to the $25,- 
000 bond issue, the people of Union City have borrowed $7,500 
for additional funds. This note is signed by over two hundred 
of the best men of the town. The note is easily worth $1,000,- 
000. The city council is to pay the note, but do not have the 
funds just now. . 
Just now the United States Health Service is aiding us in 
getting sanitary closets at all schools. This is one of the long- 
est steps forward that we have ever taken.

-OVERTON COUNTY. 
In reply to yours of September 15, requesting report on sev- 
eral items, I desire to report as follows: 
1. Consolidation and Transportation—We have made 
three consolidations this year by placing two one-teacher 
schools together and having a two-room school, or two-teacher 
school. I find that this doubles the efficiency of the school. 
No public transportation in this county. 
.
-P-A-G-E-277
—268— 
2. Buildings Hrected—tLast year we erected ten school 
houses. Most of these were two-room houses, frame buildings, 
some of them two-story and of modern type. | 
8. Bond Issues.—There have been no bonds issued in this 
county for any purpose. The people are afraid of bonds up 
here, that is, a majority of them are. 
4. We have no county supervisor, but one is badly needed. 
With 6,635 pupils and eighty-two schools it is impossible for 
the County Superintendent to do all the work that needs doing. 
5. Libraries—We have established forty-six public school 
libraries in Overton County at a cost of about $2,500.00. 
6. Attendance.—The attendance this year has been much 
better than usual, but is not what it should be by any means. 
I suggest that the compulsory law be amended so as to give 
the grand jury inquisitorial power over the. “offense of parents 
failing to send their children to school without any lawful 
excuse.” The law is not being enforced in any of the counties 
in this section of the State in its present shape. 
Cuas. C. Gorn, 
County Superintendent. 
  
PERRY COUNTY. 
We have been working hard to consolidate our schools, but . 
the topography of our county makes it a very difficult matter. 
Our general educational condition is slowly improving; 
libraries are being established with good results, and the people 
are awakening to the need of better schools. 
Attendance is improving, some of the schools being badly 
crowded. 
We have no building fund, but have succeeded in building 
four new houses by private subscription. 
An effort is being made to procure a separate fund, that 
-our houses may be improved and newly furnished. 
R. H. Gray, 
County Superintendent.

POLK COUNTY. 
During the past two years Polk County has made some 
. progress educationally. We have a growing sentiment among 
our people for better conditions generally. 
Building of pike roads has aided our school people in getting 
better results from the schools. The more roads built the 
greater the sentiment for schools is indicated. , 
Compulsory education has increased school attendance in 
Polk County. Though the lack of ample school reom has made 
compulsory attendance a difficult proposition to handle. 
Sentiment for consolidation of schools has a gradual growth 
in the county. In some sections of the county consolidation 
has been urged too strongly for a wholesome growth. 
Three consolidated school buildings have been erected dur- 
“ing the past two years, costing $4,000, $5,000 and $6,500. Bonds 
have been sold to the amount of $25,000 for the purpose of 
erecting two more consolidated grammar schools. 
Our high schools are doing much to encourage our young 
people to attend college. The high schools have done a great 
deal to create sentiment for consolidation of schools. 
During the past two years one of our three high schools has 
been erected at a cost of $22,000. Our three high schools are 
classed as first-class high schools. 
Our county agents have done much good in the rural sec- 
tions of the county in teaching tke people how to live. 
Our greatest need is efficient teachers. 
W. B. Rucxsr, 
County Superintendent. 
  PUTNAM COUNTY. 
I most respectfully submit to vou the following report, or 
outline of the work done in this county during the last two 
years. 
During the last school year we have made two consolida- 
tions, one in which two one-room schools were consolidated and 
one in which three one-voom schools were put together. We
-P-A-G-E-279
—270— 
have secured State aid for the latter school and the school 
wagon has been put on the road, this being the first experiment 
with the transportation of pupils in this county. As-this has 
been in operation for only a few weeks, it is too early to report 
definitely, but so far no complaint has been made, and it seems 
to be giving satisfaction. 
We have constructed both the buildings for the consolidated 
schools according to the plans furnished by the Rural School 
Supervisor, Mr. Brown, the ouly difference in the buildings 
being that one is larger than the other, the number of rooms 
being the same. 
We have built one one-room building this year, but we no 
longer erect box-car buildings. This building contains seating 
capacity for forty pupils, and has two porches, two cloak rooms 
and library room. 
No bond issue has been made, nor have we any county super- 
visor other than the County Superintendent. 
I am pleased to report that six new libraries have been 
added during the last two years at a cost of $218. 
The daily attendance is far from what it should be, but in 
comparing the attendance for the last four years, I find that 
there has been an increase each year of about four per cent 
over the year previous. This is some greater increase than 
the increase in scholastic population in this county during the 
same years, and while it is small, yet it is some evidence that 
our people are appreciating the schools more and that they 
are slowly and steadily growing better. 
J. M. Harrierp, 
County Superintendent. 
RHEA COUNTY. 
In the last two school years in Rhea County we have not 
pressed the consolidation of schools, “but are holding fast to 
what has been previously done in consolidation.” Transporta- 
tion is necessary in consolidation. We are using two school 
wagons in the county, giving satisfaction and doing efficient
-P-A-G-E-280
—271— 
work, We are using one or more school barns for those who 
drive to school and the same are a decided success. 
We have erected in the past two years two school buildings, 
each of which has two rooms. , 
We have issued no school bonds in Rhea County, but are 
very much in need of funds to erect school buildings to assist 
in the consolidation of small schools. 
_Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars have recently been 
secured through bond issue for road purposes and good pikes 
are being built in various parts of the county. So the indica- 
tions are good in the near future to secure bond issues for school 
purposes. 
During school year ending June 30, 1915, we used super- 
visor and attendance officer combined; during school year end- 
ing June 30, 1916, we used only attendance officer. 
During the two years ending June 30, 1916, the State and 
county aided five libraries, donating to them a total of $216.56. 
The attendance in the schools last year was better than for 
the year preceding, and is one year with another growing better 
but is not yet satisfactory. W. E. StapsEns, 
County Superintendent. 
  
ROANE COUNTY. 
School affairs are progressing in a very satisfactory way 
according to our plans in Roane County, but our plans are ° 
somewhat different from those of other counties of the State. 
In the last six years we have reduced the number of our 
schools from eighty-nine to sixty. This has been accomplished 
_ largely by our preferential school system. This system is man- 
aged in this way: We select a center with a radius of approxi- 
mately three miles, with a plet of from three to four acres, and , 
build a good house with at least four rooms. Then we give 
these schools a term of eight months school, while the other 
little schools around it only have a five months’ term. These 
little schools soon die of their own accord, as we require an 
average attendance of at least twenty as the basis for the con-
-P-A-G-E-281
272 
tinuance of a school. We feel that this brings about consolida- 
tion with the least amount of friction, as they really consolidate 
themselves. We have seventeen of these school centers in this 
county. 
In addition to our rural school system, we have built in 
the town of Rockwood a new building at a cost of nearly $45,- 
000.00. We have one in the town of Harriman nearing com- 
pletion that will cost a little more than $50,000.00. We will 
have a new high school building at Kingston ready for occu- 
pancy by January 1 at a cost of $25,000.00, and also one at 
Wheat at a cost of $11,000.00. 
We enrolled 84 per cent of our scholastic population last 
year, but our average attendance was only 60 per cent. 
We have our home economics department well organized in 
this county and producing fine results. 
Our county carries on its agricultural training under the 
regulations of the Smith-Lever bill. 
E. B. Boors, 
County Superintendent. 
  
RUTHERFORD COUNTY. 
One special feature inaugurated by the County Board re- 
cently was the budget system; the board found out the approxi- 
mate amount of money they would receive for the year from 
all sources and fixed the expenditures accordingly. A fixed 
amount for teachers’ salaries, one for fuel and necessary sup- 
plies, but nothing for hauling any coal or supplies from town 
to. the school houses; an amount to pay insurance, and an 
amount set aside to help pay off an overdraft, leaving surplus 
for any emergency. The board voted to use none of the school 
levy fer erecting school buildings or making repairs, leaving 
* this to the community. When the board met to hear the report 
of the Budget Committee, some of the board members had made 
up their minds to reduce the term of school, others wanted to 
suspend for a year to catch up, but after hearing the com- 
mittee’s report they voted to accept it aud continue the schools 
the usual length of term, eight months. The schools of the
-P-A-G-E-282
—273— 
county, both white and colored, are in better condition ‘than 
they have been since my term of office began. The survey of 
the schools made by J. B. Brown and 8. L. Smith of the State 
Department of Public Instruction, and myself helped to bring, 
the conditions squarely before the Board of Education and the 
teachers, and they immediately began to make these conditions 
better. I believe another survey made at this time would show 
an increased efficiency of at least 25 per cent over that of 
the last survey. 
The effect of the Middle Tennessee State Normal has been 
very wholesome on our rural schools by furnishing us better 
trained teachers, and by sending out members of the faculty 
to assist in community betterment and monthly institutes, 
which are held regularly throughout the year. 
J. D. Jacoss, 
County Superintendent. 
  
SCOTT COUNTY. 
Our schools are making very satisfactory progress. Our 
teachers are better qualified and more in earnest. 
The consolidation idea is unpopular among our people. 
We have one consolidated school, however, using one wagon, 
this being the second year of the experiment. Until we get 
better roads our Progress along this line must necessarily be 
very slow. 
“The county has splendid school buildings, nearly all of them 
new, erected within the last eight years. A three-room addition 
to the normal school building has just been completed. A three 
thousand dollar school dormitory. has been built this year for 
the Huntsville High School. 
No school bonds have been issued in this county and.all 
improvements are paid for out of the general school fund. 
The County Supervisor has so persistently presented to 
our teachers the importance. of organizing clubs and moonlight 
schools that some of them have apparently become quite en- 
thusiastic and interested, the result being several such. organi- 
zations in the county. The Supervisor is trying to put a library
-P-A-G-E-283
; —274— 
in every school, and is succeeding very satisfactorily. There 
are many times as many good books and periodicals being read 
by our pupils now than heretofore. 
The school attendance is very satisfactory, owing to the 
activity of our attendance officers and an increasing desire 
among our young people to secure an education. A desire to 
attend high school and the State Normal School is very ap- 
parent among our teachers and we believe the attendance at 
these institutions will be increased each year. 
M. L. McDonaxp, 
County Superintendent. 
  
SHELBY COUNTY. > 
The following is a brief report of the work done in the 
Shelby County schools during the two years ending June 30, 
1916. 
Six one-teacher schools have been abandoned. The pupils 
of these schools are now transported in wagonettes to larger 
schools. Two of the abandoned school houses have been fitted 
out for club houses and are being used for this purpose by their 
respective communities. 
Our wagonette system has been standardized, drivers being 
elected by the board and paid regular salaries instead of bid- 
ding for routes as heretofore. 
The Kerrville school building has been completed and the 
Treadwell school planned and built. They are both modern 
brick structures, costing approximately twenty thousand dol- 
lars each. Levi and Cuba have been remodeled, additions have 
been made to the Norris Avenue, Bryant, Fisherville and Caple- 
ville schools, and the splendid high school building at Milling- 
ton is well under way. This building will cost in the neighbor- 
hood of sixty-five thousand dollars and will be the best in 
the county. 
A supervisor of home economics has recently been put in 
charge of this work in the county and every girl from the fifth 
grade on through the course will be taught cooking and sewing, 
In nineteen schools a regular teacher of home economics is em-
-P-A-G-E-284
—275— 
ployed. In other schools there are teachers who had had some 
training along this line and even where there is no trained 
teacher the work is still being done under the direction of the 
supervisor. 
The Superintendent, the Supervisor of Home Economics and 
the Supervisor of Primary Work visit the schools regularly, 
the supervisors making most of the schools once a month. 
There has been marked improvement in the primary grades 
within the past two years. The work is being done along mod- 
ern educational lines. There is much. supplemental reading, 
hand work and physical exercise. Story-telling is a regular 
feature in most of the schools and organized games and plays 
and singing form a part of the program in every school. 
We have a fine body of teachers, including many college 
and normal school graduates. There is possibly not a teacher 
in the county who has not had the equivalent of a high school 
education. A majority of the teachers do summer school work 
at least every other year, training for their special line of work. 
The efforts of individual teachers is recognized and promotions 
are frequently made, a number of our best principals having 
been chosen from the teaching body. 
There is a constantly increasing interest on the part of our 
communities in the schools, the following being a summary of 
the amounts raised and expended on the schools last year— 
this in no instance includes any expenditures by the Board 
  of Education: ~ POP aS

SMITH COUNTY. 
One consolidated building will be completed by first of 
year; two more on hand. We have no public transportation, 
but 10 per cent of students in large schools have private con- 
veyances. 
One one-teacher house has been erected during year almost 
entirely by private subscription. 
Only five libraries have been established during year. 
Schools have all opened, and many have very large attend- 
ance. All are full. Perhaps the best proof of our progress 
is found in these figures. In 1908 we had only 190 above the 
seventh grade, while in 1916 we had 587 enrolled above the 
seventh. This has been accomplished in spite of a constant 
loss in scholastic population. E. L. Hurrines, 
County Superintendent. 
  
SUMNER COUNTY. 
We have consolidated eight schools into three and have 
under way two other consolidations at present. 
Our new consolidated school buildings are costing from 
two to three thousand dollars each, with auditorium for public 
use in each building. —
-P-A-G-E-286
—277— 
We run three school wagons, hauling an average of twenty 
pupils each. 
We have erected five new school buildings, costing from 
one to three thousand dollars each, the county paying half 
and the patrons of each school half the cost of these buildings. 
We have established twenty-nine new libraries at a cost of 
$857.81. We have also six circulating libraries from the State. 
Total number of libraries in the county, 95. 
The attendance in Sumner County is larger each year. We 
attribute this to the personal work of each teacher and the 
school spirit that our high schools have helped us to create. 
We have two first-class high schools and nine two-year high 
schools. In two years our high school students have grown 
in number from fifty to four hundred and thirty-one. This 
growth is largely due to efficient work of our high school prin- 
cipals, Professors Williams and Marton. 
At the suggestion of State High School” Inspector Wm. R. 
Bourne, we called an educational conference for Sumner Coun- 
ty to meet at Gallatin for two days and had eaeh civil district 
to send delegates to this conference, Gallatin giving free enter- 
tainment to each delegate. The object of this conference was 
to discuss school conditions and how to improve them, and 
to create sentiment for an additional school tax of ten cents. 
By the assistance of State Superintendent S. W. Sherrill, High 
School Inspector Wm. R. Bourne, President R. L. Jones of 
Middle Tennessee State Normal and our local talent, we suc- 
ceeded. 
When the County Court met in April it raised our ele- 
mentary school tax from forty to fifty cents. 
With this additional levy we hope to run our elementary 
schools eight months in each year, two-year high schools eight 
months, first-class high schools nine months, thereby enabling 
us to standardize and systematize all the schools of Sumner 
County. T. W. Honrer, 
~ County Superintendent.

UNICOI COUNTY. 
During the biennial period ending June 30, 1916, we have 
erected two one-room school houses, contracted for a modern 
five-room building, also bought another valuable building when 
the title is cleared. 
We also have voted twelve thousand doliars of bonds for 
a city school in Erwin, and bought property worth thirty-five 
thousand dollars for a county high school in Erwin, and levied 
a high school tax for same. All these things have been brought 
about largely through the influence of the E. T. 8. N. 8S. at 
Johnson City. Six new libraries were established and several 
others supplemented. 
The per cent of attendance was the best it ever was, due 
to the compulsory law. Lizzin RopeErts, 
: County Superintendent. 
VAN BUREN COUNTY. 
This being a mountainous county, we have done nothing 
toward consolidation. We have erected one large one-room 
school building to take the place of a small log hut. We have 
twenty-one schools; thirteen of them have libraries. Our coun- 
ty has made good progress in the canning club and home demon- 
stration work. Attendance fairly good. 
Mrs. Evia B. Worth incron, 
- County Superintendent. 
WASHINGTON COUNTY. 
During the biennial period ending June 30, 1916, there has 
been a marked increase in enrol]Jment and average daily attend- 
ance in our schools. 
A. $5,000 consolidated school building, with three class- 
rooms, library and assembly hall, has been completed and the 
school put into successful operation. | 
A few more libraries have been established, and a large
-P-A-G-E-288
—279— 
number previously established have been supplemented. Last 
year we raised more money for libraries than any other county 
in the State. 
Last year a farm demonstration agent was employed, with 
good results, but on account of limited funds, no supervisors 
have been employed since 1914. E. §. Depew, 
County Superintendent. 
  
WEAKLEY COUNTY. 
The school work of Weakley County has been steadily pro- 
gressing for the past few years. The county board system has 
been a very potent factor in securing a more uniform sygtem 
of grading and employing teachers. 
Our county board employs no supervisors for our schools, 
but we think it will in another year. 
We have consolidated a number of schools in the past two 
and a half years. One of these consolidated schools has been 
erected at a cost of about $5,000.00, the State aiding in its 
erection to the amount of $1,000.00. Four two-teacher schools 
were merged into this school, which is being maintained at 
about the same cost per month on what the four abandoned 
schools would have cost had they been continued this year. 
At the same time the attendance of the pupils is more regular 
and the character of the work done in the school is a decided 
improvement. . 
The citizens residing in the neighborhood of the Central 
High School, which is a consolidated school, have erected a 
home for the teachers on the campus. Also the citizens of the 
Sidonia Consolidated School district are building one for. their 
teachers. We do not know of another county of West Tennes- 
see that has teachers’ homes on the school grounds. 
Our county has been sorely handicapped with an indebted- 
ness of about $20,000.00, which is a millstone about our necks. 
This indebtedness was caused by the erection of school houses 
which were absolutely necessary. We have put before the 
County Court the question of bonds for school building pur- 
poses, and the court has taken the matter under consideration.
-P-A-G-E-289

The boys’ and girls’ corn and tomato club work in this 
county was a great success this year, the boys and girls carry- 
ing off premiums of high honor at both the State and Tri- 
State fairs. A great club demonstration for the county has 
been planned for November 24 and 25. The County Court voted 
$300.00 at the October term for the girls’ canning club work 
-next year. 
We have paid special attention to attendance this year and 
have succeeded in keeping it up much better than formerly. 
The plan we are using is working nicely, but I am of the 
opinion that the attendance problem will not be fully solved 
until a medical inspector for the county schools is furnished 
by the county to examine and treat those children suffering 
fragn defective eyesight, partial deafness, adenoids and other 
common ailments, which are used by indifferent parents as an 
excuse for non-attendance of their children. 
Eight libraries were established during the past school 
year. Besides these, two other schools were increased by dona- 
tions from public-spirited men and women of the respective 
schools. 
Our plans for the future are: More consolidated schools,

WILLIAMSON COUNTY. 
While we have not accomplished all that we desired, yet 
we have had marked improvement in the last two years in 
matters educational in Williamson County. 
We have a good strong school of two or more teachers in 
nearly every district,'and our high schools have helped to 
standardize our system and to keep the large boys and girls 
on the farms, every year’s attendance being larger than the 
preceding. 
We have erected only one new building and have only one 
new one in course of erection, but have modernized a number
-P-A-G-E-290
—281— 
of our old ones, and have some splendid structures with mod- 
ern equipment. 
We have issued no bonds. 
“We have a nine months’ school term. 
We have no supervisor for our white schools. Our colored- 
supervisor has greatly improved our colored schools in the 
various industrial arts. : 
We have a good working library for nearly every school, 
and supplement these from time to time. Our county circu- 
lating library furnishes to the schools books for every grade and 
for the time they are needed, to be exchanged for other books 
when not needed. This library grows in size and usefulness 
every year. 
Each year shows a perceptible increase in attendance of 
pupils, efficiency of teachers and community interest.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF LIBRARY EXTENSION 
The State of Tennessee is an example of effort, interest and 
law in bringing good books within the reach of every child in 
the common schools. 
School libraries have been a part of the educational scheme 
of Tennessee since 1909. In that year the State identified it- 
self with this forward movement in education by having the 
General Assembly set aside one per cent of the General Edu- 
cation Fund to aid schools that would manifest their interest 
in book culture by meeting the school half way in its endeavor, 
aiding to the extent of Twenty Dollars on the first order of 
books for each school, and Ten Dollars annually on all subse- 
quent orders, provided the school itself raise and appropriate 
for this purpose an equal amount. 
To further encourage and stimulate interest and effort in 
this direction, the Legislature of 1918 amended the public 
school library law, allowing dollar for dollar; that is, dupli- 
cating the amount raised by a school from Ten to Forty Dol- 
lars to establish or supplement a library each school year. 
The work was strongly reinforced by the same Legislature em- 
powering and authorizing the State Board of Education to 
employ a Director of Library Extension, defining her duties 
and powers in the following words: 
“Tt shall be the duty of the Director of Library Extension 
to encourage and stimulate the establishment of libraries, es- 
pecially in public schools; to prepare selected lists of books 
adapted to the needs of various schools from the list approved 
by the State Board of Mducation; to render such assistance as 
the State Board of Education may require in the preparation 
of general school library lists; to visit teachers’ institutes and 
other educational and community meetings in the interest of 
library extension and for the purpose of giving instruction in 
the selection, care and use of libraries, to assist the State Su- 
perintendent of Public Instruction in preparing Reading Circle 
Courses for public school teachers and pupils; and to perform 
such additional duties as the State Board of Education may 
prescribe,”

Surervision or ScHoou Liprarizs. 
According to legislative enactment this office has concerned 
itself with promoting school library interests in general, in 
improvement of the rural school libraries, making school 1i- 
brary aids available, attempting to raise the standard of 
service in school libraries, correlating the school libraries and 
the public libraries, urging instruction in the use of books 
in the high schools, and more work in children’s literature in 
the normal schools, giving advice in organization and the pub- 
lication of school library aids, the preparation of lists, ex-- 
hibits and talks at school meetings. 
Roursau Scuoor Liprarins. 
Since this work has had supervision, the remotest and 
most unsettled counties of the State have been penetrated by 
the good book movement, and are responding to an unexpected 
degree. Only three counties have failed to take advantage of 
State aid in the past four years. The number of negro schools, 
applying for aid is indeed gratifying. 
The school library advance has been decidedly notable dur- 
ing the past two years and highly encouraging for the future. 
During this biennial period there has been a total expenditure 
of over $35,000 for library books appearing on the State ap- 
proved lists, including State aid of more than $17,000. Al- 
though the aid which each school has received has been small, 
the number of books in school libraries has grown to repre- 
sent a large collection. 
The effort to benefit the rural school libraries has met with 
the most hearty support and coéperation on the part of county 
superintendents. They have distributed lists and aids to their 
schools and have given place on the program of their teachers’ 
meetings for discussion of the rural school library and its 
needs. During the years 1914-1916 rural teachers’ and officers’ 
meetings were addressed at State and county institutes and 
other educational meetings. 
Hicu ScHoo. Lisraries. 
The majority of the first-class high schools of Tennessee
-P-A-G-E-293
—284— 
have libraries. In some the collection of books is quite small ; 
in others the number is between one and two thousand books, 
but with some very large collections. Yearly additions range 
from ten to seven hundred and fifty. | 
Library service is given by teachers and pupils giving only 
part time to the library. Only three schools report any com- 
pensation for library service. Two of these libraries are ad- 
ministered by trained librarians. The teachers of the State 
have, without pay, given much time and work to the school 
library ; but the teacher’s time is fully taken up in most schools, 
and she cannot in fairness be expected to give, in addition, 
this extra service for which she is untrained and unpaid. If 
she is to serve as librarian she should be relieved of some of 
her other work and be paid for this at the same rate as the 
other. 
NEEDS. 
One of the greatest needs of the high school libraries is of 
organization. In many cases they are of little value because 
they are not so arranged or adininistered as to be of service. 
The library must be arranged, preferably by a standard 
system of classification kept in order, and such records kept as 
will show the location of the book on the shelves in the library, 
who has it if it is out, and whether the library contains a book 
by a certain author, of a given title, or on a particular subject. 
To be of use, the library must be under the direct care of 
some one person who is trained for the duties and who is paid 
for regular hours of this service. 
Liprary TRrarnine. 
Instruction in elementary library methods has been given 
by the Director of Library Extension at the regular and sum- 
mer sessions of the State normal schools. 
The marked increase in the establishment and growth of 
school libraries created an evident demand for teachers capable 
of developing such libraries. 
The object of the course was to place before the teachers 
of the rural schools the elementary training which would en-
-P-A-G-E-294
—285-— 
able them to select, care for, use and help the pupils to use 
books in an intelligent manner. 
Jt is imperative that our normal schools require all gradu- 
ates to know how to administer and care for a school library. 
The State looks to our normals for trained teachers, and has 
a right to expect them to be able to select the best books for 
children, and to know how to use them after they have been 
selected. Every teacher should get in connection with her 
normal course such knowledge of books as tools to help her to’ 
be a more efficient teacher and to direct the reading of the 
children under her care. 
EXHIBITS. 
At the four normal schools a miodel rural school library 
for the first eight grades has been permanently placed to put 
the prospective trained teacher in touch with a carefully 
chosen, well-balanced library. To bring the attention of the 
school library to those in attendance at the divisional educa- 
tional meetings an exhibit book was made. Every opportunity 
to visualize the work of this important phase of educational 
activity has been taken advantage of by the Division of Library 
Extension. 
Community SERvIct. 
The consolidated school is founded upon the idea of com- 
munity service, and all the equipment should be a means to this 
end. In this work the library should play an important part. 
In a number of Tennessee’s consolidated schools the library 
room is sufficiently large to be used as a reading room, is easy 
of access, and the people use it freely. Libraries in such schools 
serve as a bureau of information for farmers’ and home-makers’ 
clubs, and other neighborhood organizations. 
Many of the books on the State school lists are of interest 
to the grown people, particularly those on agriculture, home 
economics and books of travel, biography and history, as well . 
as many of the stories.
-P-A-G-E-295

Futvre DEVELOPMENT. 
The greatest problem of the present and future in respect to 
rural school libraries is that the books already provided be 
properly cared for and used. The crying need is for organiza- 
tion. It is essential that the rural teachers should realize that 
the school library is an important part of the school equip- 
ment and needs intelligent direction. To help the busy teacher 
in making the library a vital factor in her school there has 
been published in the introductory pages of both the list of 
books for elementary and high school libraries an explanation 
of the State school library lists from which books must be 
selected if State aid is granted, some principles of book selec- 
tion, how to order and care for the library, some suggestions 
on the use, a suggestive list of typical children’s books for a 
reading circle course, and a list of books on story telling. 
County Lipraries. 
Among the many agencies now at work to bring town and 
country together, and to give to people in the country and the 
town the same benefits of school, library, and other general wel- 
fare taxes, none is more promising than the county library. 
The county as a unit of taxation and effort promises larger re- 
sults than the scattered efforts of its various communities. 
The greatest future need in the development of the school 
library proposition is the county library, where schools may 
turn oyer to it all the books other than reference, and the fund 
which the school and State expends for school library purposes, 
the school to become a branch of the county library, and to 
receive from it groups of books for the use of the pupils. AI 
books furnished in this way are to be selected from the State 
approved lists. Such combinations are authorized in Cali- 
fornia by the county library law. 
The advantages to the school would come in having the help 
of a trained librarian in selecting books suited to the needs of 
that particular county and school; of having always good 
books in good condition, and of being able to supply fresh read- 
ing matter when all the books had been read.

REPORT OF SOME SPECIAL WORK AMONG RURAL 
NEGRO SCHOOLS IN TENNESSEE, 1915-16. , 
By 8. L. Smrru, Srare Rurat Scrioon Sururvisor. 
Homemakers’ Cius Work. 
The reports of the supervisors for Homemakers’ Club for 
Negroes in July and August, 1915, in the ten counties where 
this work has been organized, show that 86,714 quarts of 
berries, fruits, tomatoes, other vegetables, etc., were put up 
under the special direction of these women who are trained 
in Home Economics. At ten cents per can this would amount 
to $8,671.40. The General Education Board appropriated $1,- 
050.00 to be spent for Homemakers’ Club work in July and 
August. 
There were 546 home gardens cultivated under the direc- 
tion of these supervisors; 212 cooking lessons given to 2,500 
colored girls and their mothers in the rural districts; 298 
sewing lessons given to 3,100 girls and their mothers, and 165 
houses whitewashed. Some of the detailed reports of these 
supervisors, showing how they have gone into the filthy homes 
and helped to clean them up and put things in orderly ar: 
rangement, are very interesting, but space will not permit their 
being given in this report.

By the aid of the Slater and General Education Boards, 
three county training schools were established last year, lo- 
eated in each of the following counties: Fayette, Haywood 
and Shelby. The aid is given on five conditions: 
1. ‘That the building be modern, with equipment for in- 
dustrial work, including practical manual training, home eco- 
nomics, agriculture and some elementary pedagogy in the last 
year. : 
2. That the school be under county and State control. 
3. That the county board pay at least $750.00 a year for 
salaries in the school. 
4, That the length of the term shall be eight months. 
. 5. That the school shall have at least eight grades, with 
possibly one or two grades extra added as soon as conditions 
warrant it, and with the course of study thoroughly vitalized 
and socialized. 
Fayerre Country Training ScHoon. 
The Fayette County Training School represents a consoli- 
dation of three small schools, one of which is an old log cabin, 
another a dilapidated frame building almost ready to fall

down, the other a fairly good box car building of the old type. 
The new building is a modern, one-story frame building, with 
six standard size classrooms, an auditorium, library and read- 
ing room, and an office. It has solid brick foundation and con- 
crete basement for heating. The building is located on ten 
acres of good land, every foot of which is usable. The total 
cost of building, equipment and grounds was about $5,500.00, 
raised as follows: $2,000.00 by the negroes ; $1,000.00 by Slater 
Board; $1,000.00 by the State; $750.00 by General Education 
Board, and $750.00 by the County Board of Education. An 
appropriation of $350.00 has been made by the General Educa- 
tion Board to aid in building a “teacherage” on the school 
premises. 
The total number enrolled in the three abandoned schools 
was about 250—in the new school 533. The principal, in addi- 
tion to his literary work, looks after the agriculture and man- 
ual training, and his wife has charge of the home economics. 
The Slater Board gives $500.00 a year for salaries. 
. SuHetpy Country Training ScHoot. 
This building, consisting of six large rooms and a hall, was 
erected by the County Board at a cost of about $6,000.00, and 
takes the place of a one-room dilapidated frame building. The 
General Education Board furnished about $500.00 to buy lum- 
ber for a shop and equip it with tools. The principal and 
students have erected a good two-room building, a modern 
poultry house, and playground equipment. The negroes of 
the community have raised $500.00 to buy extra land for agri- 
culture. The old school was taught by one teacher and an 
assistant for a short time each year, with an enrollment of 
about one hundred and fifty pupils; the new school has seven 
teachers and five hundred and thirty pupils. The principal 
has manual training and agriculture and his wife home eco- 
nomics. The General Education Board has appropriated 
$350.00 to aid in building a “teacherage.” The Slater Board 
pays $500.00 a year for salaries.

The Haywood County Training School received $500.00 aid

from the Slater Board this year, which enabled the board to 
install a good Home Economics Department. The building is 
not new, but is fairly modern. The General Education Board 
appropriated $500.00 to aid in painting the building, and 
building and equipping a manual training department. The 
board is arranging to use two or three acres for agricultural 
demonstration. The enrollment is about five hundred. 
The Slater Board will continue to give $500.00 each to 
these three schools for teachers’ salaries, and has agreed to 
give $1,000.00 to-help in establishing two more of these schools 
for 1916-17. 
RoseNwaLp ScHoots. 
Through Tuskegee Institute we secured $300.00 each for 
five rural negro schools, paid by Julius Rosenwald. This 
money is given on condition (1) that the community and coun- 
ty raise at least $300.00 or whatever amount above this sum 
is necessary to complete a modern building, paint inside and 
outside, and furnish it with desks and some industrial equip- 
ment; (2). that the building and grounds be deeded to the 
county, and the school placed under State and county con- 
trol. The following amounts have been raised, and the build- 
ings are being erected:

We are expecting to receive aid for eight or ten more 
schools during 1916-17. 
Sumer Insrirures. 
The General Education Board donated $250.00 to aid in 
holding summer schools in Fayette and Shelby Counties, the 
session in each county to be at least four weeks.
-P-A-G-E-300
—291— 
In Fayette County most of the time was taken up in review 
work, preparatory for the May examination. This was neces- 
sary, owing to the fact that practically all the negro teachers 
failed in the previous examinations, and the board is unwilling 
to import teachers who are not familiar with Fayette County 
conditions. 
The Shelby County Summer School had six weeks’ session, 
The work was taught by some of the leading white principals 
of the city and county, and was very helpful. Every teacher 
was required to take industrial work. 
MOoonLicHT ScHooLs. 
Shelby County organized several moonlight schools last 
year, with very excellent results. Under the direction of the 
Superintendent, Miss Williams, the teachers were glad to offer 
their services free of charge. he chief feature of the schools 
was the industrial work. One old woman seventy-two years 
old learned to dress a doll and was as happy over it as a child 
would be. Another old woman about the same age learned to 
use a Sewing machine for the first time and bought one. for 
her home. Home economics and practical manual training are 
taught to all who attend. 
District SuPERVISORS. 
Through Mr. Keffer and Miss Moore, of the Division of Ex- 
tension, Knoxville, Tennessee, two district supervisors have 
been appointed to aid in the colored work of Tennessee. These 
women are to be trained in home economics and other neces- 
sary industrial work, and are paid entirely by the Division 
of Extension ‘at Knoxville, but are to work under the direction 
of the Division of Extension and the State Department of 
Education, making duplicate reports to each. It will be their 
duty to work through the county supervisors in each county 
where the work has been organized, and under the direction 
of the County Superintendent of that county. One will have 
charge of the West Tennessee counties, the other Middle and 
East Tennessee.

Supervisors’. CONFERENCE. 
A special Supervisors’ Conference was called to convene 
at the A, & I. State Normal, June 26-July 7. This conference 
was aided by Dr. Dillard of the Jeanes and Slater Boards. 
They hope next year to have a conference of Tennessee and 
Kentucky supervisors, and, if possible, secure enough aid from 
the Jeanes Board to. pay all the expenses of the said supervisors. 
President Hale of the State Normal very kindly agreed to put 
on special courses in supervision during this conference, in 
order to train these workers to do their new duties more 
efficiently. sa Ba 
A CoMBINATION PLAN, 
In October, 1914, we were able to offer Dyer County $75.00 
aid toward putting on an industrial supervisor. The city 
board paid the remainder of the salary in order to.have her 
spend about half time in the Dyersburg school teaching in- 
dustrial work. Through the generosity of the pastor of one 
of the white churches and the ladies of the church, a three- 
room building was furnished at their expense for this work. 
Many of the white women of the town cooperated in canipping 
a model kitchen and sewing department. 
At the time this work was installed—1914—there was an 
enrollment of about 400 in the school and eight teachers at 
$30.00 per month, except the principal’s salary, which was 
more. For the year 1915-16 they had fifteen teachers with not 
one drawing a salary of less than $40.00, and an enrollment 
of 700 students, fifty of whom were in the high school depart- 
ment. They now have a man giving his time to manual train- 
ing and agriculture, and a woman giving all her time to home 
economics with an assistant part of the time. : 
When a member of the Board of Education was-asked what 
brought about this rapid changes of things, he said it was the 
introduction of industrial work, and that while the city is 
paying more than double what was paid three years ago, it is 
amply repaid in the increased results obtained. 
Many other cities are following the example of Dyersburg.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE STATE HIGH SCHOOL INSPECTOR. 
To the State Board of Education : 
I herewith submit the statistical report of my work as State High . 
School Inspector for the second year of service. 
The facts have been presented in the tables and summaries as they 
were received from the Superintendents of the high school counties. 
Let me add to the facts, a simple statement that the interest in high 
school progress is stronger than I have seen it, and the outlook bright for 
astronger advance next year than has been made during the past twelve 
months. , 
Respectfully submitted, 
W. R. BOURNE, 
State High School Inspector.

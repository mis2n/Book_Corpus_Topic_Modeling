REPORT. 
  
 
-P-A-G-E-13
 
-P-A-G-E-14
REPORT, 
The present State Superintendent has prepared this report 
after much long and persistent work. His predecessor made no 
report for the two years of his incumbency, and, therefore, left 
no data from which this report could be prepared and submitted. 
Such information as it contains is that furnished by city and 
county Superintendents after repeated requests. Many of these 
officials have promptly and gladly responded to every request for 
information, and have submitted their quarterly and annual re- 
ports. The same is true of a large number of Trustees. In some 
instances, however, Superintendents and Trustees have been 
so negligent in making and forwarding reports required of them 
by law that my work has been completed over almost impassable 
difficulties. ‘The law should be amended so that the State Super- 
intendent shall have ample power and authority to obtain all 
information as the law requires him to do, and there should be 
some kind of amendment fixing a penalty for the failure and 
refusal of officials to report the condition of finances and other 
matters. There is upon the statute books something in the 
nature of authority given the State Superintendent, but it needs 
further amendment in order that every case may be reached. It 
is hoped that the incoming Legislature will make such changes 
and amendments as will meet this material weakness in the sys- 
tem. Other changes in the law and amendments for the per- 
fection of the public school system will be urged in the annual 
report which will be submitted prior to the assembling of the 
next General Assembly. The Legislature of Tennessee has 
done much already for public education, and especially the Fifty- 
first General Assembly was marked by an unusual interest and 
patriotic effort to better conditions in the State and to foster edu- 
cation. The public schools of Tennessee are equaled by but
-P-A-G-E-15
aa fa 
few, and are not surpassed in excellence by any Southern State. 
The school term is growing in length, all teachers are paid 
better salaries, the standard of teachers is improved, profes- 
sional school work is encouraged, and there is every reason to 
believe that each succeeding year will show most satisfactory and 
gratifying results. Tennessee has more colleges and universi- 
ties of influence, importance, and interstate reputation than any 
State in the Union. There is now neither jealousy nor conflict 
between these institutions and the public school system, because 
the public schools are the nurseries from which colleges and uni- 
versities gather their most earnest and hopeful students. Here- 
tofore there has been a missing link in our school system, because 
the public schools in most counties did not qualify students for 
entrance to either our colleges or universities. The Fifty-first 
General Assembly passed what is termed a “ County High School 
Bill,” which authorizes and empowers each County Court in the 
State to elect a County Board of Education with full authority 
to establish one or more high schools in each county. These 
high schools, when established, will be free to all students of such 
county, under certain regulations prescribed by the County 
Board of Education. It is believed that in the near future 
many, if not most, of the counties of the State will establish 
county high schools; and when this is done there will be no miss- 
ing link, but one continuous system, from the primary through 
the secondary and high school departments of our public schools 
into first-class colleges and universities. This report is a report 
. only of the work done in the public schools of the State and such 
institutions of learning as are supported, in part or entirely, by 
appropriations made by the State. The State Superintendent 
has required the principal, superintendent, or president of each 
institution to which the State contributes to submit to him a re- 
port of the condition of such institution and specific information 
of the kind, class, and character of work performed by them. 
These reports show that all these institutions are in a prosper- 
ous condition, that the attendance is good, and that the work 
being performed is thorough and practical in every respect. 
The last Legislature enacted into law what is known as the
-P-A-G-E-16
—15— ; 
“Text-book Bill,’ empowering a commission selected by the 
Governor to adopt books for use in the public schools of the 
State. This law has been put into actual operation, adoptions 
have been made, and the system under this law is now under- 
going a trial in the schools. From reports of Superintendents 
and teachers, books adopted have given almost universal satis- 
faction, and the pupils and citizens of the State heartily approve 
the law and the adoption made by the Commission. The law 
guarantees uniformity in books in all the public schools of the 
State for a period of five years, and by its operation the pur- 
chasers of books save on an average more than 33 per cent, 
when compared with prices prevailing before this adoption. 
The importance of this subject, the universal interest in it, is 
such that a brief report of the adoptions appears in the Appen- 
dix to this report. 
The Institute work for the year ending June 30, 1899, was 
performed during a former administration; and as no report of 
such work is available, this report embraces a full and accurate 
account of all the Institute work, county and State, done under 
this administration during the year 1899. It will be noticed 
that County Institutes were held in almost every county in the 
State, and that a large number of the best and most successful 
teachers attended them. The State Institutes were unusually 
successful, and the attendance and work performed very gratify- 
ing. The teachers of Tennessee are indebted to the friends of 
education in the last General Assembly for an increased appro- 
priation for Institute purposes, and the State and all its citi- 
zens are grateful to Hon. J. L. M. Curry and the Peabody Board 
of Trust for their long-continued generosity to the State. The 
appropriation made annuallyby this Board has enabled the State 
Superintendent to increase the usefulness of his office and to 
assist many of the counties materially. The present incumbent 
has personally visited nearly all the counties in the State, and 
from personal inspection he is satisfied that the public schools of 
the State are in a more prosperous condition and have a more 
cordial and generous support among the people than at any time 
since their establishment. Future Legislators will, in their wis-
-P-A-G-E-17
—16— 
dom and patriotism, increase appropriations for this cause and 
otherwise encourage such legislation as will perfect the system, 
and thus place within the reach of every child in the State a 
school, free, in which an education can be obtained which will 
qualify him for usefulness and good citizenship.

For the above table reports were not received from the counties 
of Chester, Cocke, Fayette, Henderson, Jackson, Lawrence, Lin- 
coln, Putnam, and Wilson, and for these counties estimates were 
made, based on the reports for 1896, 1897, and 1898. From the 
counties of Fentress and Van Buren, also, no reports were re- 
ceived. The last report from Fentress County as to enrollment 
« was made in 1892; from Van Buren County in 1893, As com- 
pared with the report of 1896, the last report made, the above 
  table shows an increase in the enrollment for all of the branches ~ 
-- included in the course of study for primary schools, and a de- 
crease in all of the branches included in the sixth, seventh, and 
eighth grades of the secondary schools, with the exception of 
Physiology and Hygiene, which is both a primary and a second- 
ary study. There isan increase in the number enrolled for the 
study of vocal music, and a decrease in the number enrolled for 
the study of elocution.

As compared with 1896 this shows a slight decrease in the

Compared with 1896 this shows an increase of six days in the 
average number of days taught, but a slight decrease in number 
of certificates and diplomas issued. This is accounted for by the 
failure of some Superintendents to report fully upon these mat- 
ters.

CONCLUSION. 
CHARACTER OF WORK, 
On the first day the Institute was organized as a training 
school for teachers; each branch of the public school course was 
taken and a class organized. The Conductor and Instructors, 
having a regular schedule of recitations arranged, carried the 
work on daily as a well-regulated school, letting nothing of a 
general or special nature interfere with the regular programme. 
During the entire term there were but two lectures delivered hy 
persons other than Instructors, and these were by Mr. Hart, of 
Virginia, and Prof. W. T. Wade, of Dickson, Tenn. 
Each day lessons were assigned in all the branches; and when 
the day’s session closed, the teachers took their books and studied 
as faithfully as any student ever studied to prepare for the next 
recitations. I have never seen a class of people work harder 
during the time than the teachers attending the Institute at Dick- 
son; and we believe much good was done. 
EXAMINATIONS, 
The questions were prepared with much care, and were made 
test questions, rather than catches. It was the intention of the 
Instructors to ask such questions as would test knowledge of 
principles and facts and lead the teachers into the study of such 
important matter as is often neglected. 
ROLL OF HONOR. 
We found those taking the Secondary Course to be well pre- 
pared for a hasty review of the branches, and their examination 
marks as well as their class work satisfied the Instructors that 
they were qualified and entitled to a four-years’ State Certificate. 
_ As will be seen from the foregoing, those. completing the Sec- 
ondary Course are: Miss Eddy Byrn, of Humphreys County; 
Miss Elizabeth Truett, of Williamson County; Hugh Lenox, of 
Obion County; Paul Seavey, of Lawrence County; and B. B. 
Roberts, of Williamson County.

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE. 
JACKSON, TENNESSEE, 
JUNE 12 TO JULY 7, 1899. 
Sir: I have the honor to submit herewith the report of the 
State Peabody Institute held by your direction at Jackson, 
Tenn., June 12 to July 7, 1899. 
The sessions each day were from 8 A.M. to 1 P.M. Specific 
parts of the public school course of instruction were assigned 
each day as subjects of study for the following day’s work. In- 
struction was given by lectures and questions, both on subjeet- 
matter and methods of teaching each branch of study. 
As in former years, the Jackson Institute has been conducted 
as nearl¥ as possible upon the model of a well-organized Normal 
school. The results have been very satisfactory, both to In- 
structors and the teachers attending. Many of those who com- 
pleted the course in former years were present this year, review- 
ing their work and testifying to the great benefits the Institute 
had been to them. None of the names of these, however, appear 
in the enrollment, as we have adopted the strict rule of. enrolling 
none except those who go regularly into the classes and do the 
systematic work of the school. 
We had one lecture each week on literary, social, or general 
educational subjects, delivered by Revs. Dr. Martin, Dr. Sulli- 
van, Dr. Haywood, and Mr. Matthews. These were known to 
be able and scholarly men and devoted friends of popular educa- 
tion. Their lectures were up to the high mark of their best 
efforts, and were entertaining, instructive, and elevating. No 
other outside matters were admitted to the Institute. 
The personnel of the Institute presented a fine body of teach- 
ers, representing every county in West Tennessee, and the zeal 
and enthusiasm with which they entered into the very spirit of 
the work promises “ good things to come ” for the public schools 
of the State. 
A
-P-A-G-E-80
Deep 
Prof. Wharton S. Jones being engaged with the Schoolbook 
Commission, his place was filled the first week by Capt. Thomas 
H. Paine, our former Conductor; the second week, by Superin- 
tendent Mitchell, of Milan. I wish to bear testimony to the effi- 
cient and satisfactory service rendered by these gentlemen as 
Instructors. 
Prof. T. ©. Karns, of Knoxville, as the “new member” of 
cur Faculty, has endeared himself to every one connected with 
the Institute by his ability as an instructor, and his kind and 
sympathetic solutions of many of the difficulties that beset the 
young teacher. Long may he be “one of us!” Professors 
Mynders and Jones fully maintain their high standard of fidelity 
and industry, and seem to grow more genial in spirit, more ear- 
nest in work, and clearer in expression as the years go by. > 
The local Board of Managers and the people of Jackson have 
contributed greatly to the success of the Institute, and their 
valuable services and commendable enterprise are duly acknowl- 
edged. 
While we sincerely regret the illness of the State Superin- 
tendent that prevented his visiting us, we take pleasure in ex- 
pressing our thanks for the promptness and kindness that marked 
all of his business dealings with the Institute. So efficient had 
been the management of his office that on Friday afternoon at 
the closing of the Institute every inquiry had been answered, 
every blank had been furnished, and every certificate had been 
signed and was ready to be filled out and delivered. 
The Jackson Institute is a good one; it has made its impress 
upon the teaching in West Tennessee, and, under favorable 
auspices, has before it a career of unbounded usefulness. 
Appended is a tabulated statement of enrollment, ete., and 
names of those to whom certificates were granted on July 7, 
1899. Very respectfully, 
G. R. MWGEE, Conductor.

‘ STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE, 
HARRIMAN, TENNESSEE, 
JUNE 19, FOUR WEEKS. 
Sir: I send you herewith the Minutes of the State Peabody 
Institute which was held at Harriman, beginning on June 19, 
1899, and continuing four weeks. 
At the opening session the Instructors appointed by you— 
Prof. Reed L. MeDonnold, Secretary of the State Teachers’ 
Association; Dr. Wm. M. Graybill, President of Rogersville 
Synodical College; and Prof. J. T. Mallicoat, Superintendent 
Harriman City Schools—were all present. 
Miss Lizzie Beeler, by vote of the Institute, was made Secre- 
tary, and Professor Mallicoat was appointed Secretary of the 
Faculty. Two sessions were held each day—from 8:30 to 12 
in the morning, and from 2 to 4:30 in the afternoon. The at- 
tendance was very regular throughout. 
Work was done in both the Primary and Secondary Courses, 
the division of subjects being as follows: 
Gilbreath: Theory and Practice, Methods, School Manage- 
ment, School Law. 
MecDonnold: Arithmetic, English Grammar, Rhetoric, Al- 
gebra, Geometry. 
Graybill: United States History, Physiology, Geography, 
Civil Government. 
Mallicoat: Tennessee History, Reading, Writing, Geology, 
Physics, 
Tn addition to the regular work of the Institute, practical and 
helpful talks were made during the session by Drs. Spence, 
Scomp, and Taggart, and Professor Peake, of the American 
Temperance University; Dr. G. F. Mellen, of the University of 
Tennessee; Prof. J. R. Lowry, of the Knoxville City Schools; 
Prof. W. C.. Lawson, of the Rockwood City Schools; Dr. R. N. 
Price, and others.

The official visit of the State Superintendent to the Institute 
was much appreciated, and his earnest and practical address was 
productive of much good. The city officials and citizens of 
Harriman were much interested in the success of the Institute 
and did all in their power to make all its sessions pleasant. They 
furnished, without charge to the State for all the meetings, the 
beautiful Woman’s Temple, and showed at all times every cour- 
tesy to both faculty and teachers. 
While the attendance was good, it was not as large as it should 
have been. The Superintendent of Schools in the county in 
which the Institute was located did not give it cordial support. 
He and all the County Superintendents of all the adjoining coun- 
ties, with one exception, conducted County Normals during the 
session of the State Institute, and these local meetings kept away 
many teachers who otherwise would have been in attendance. 
Examinations were conducted on the last three days of the 
Tustitute, open to all who had attended fifteen days. Of those 
who took the examination, 80 per cent made an average grade of 
not less than 85, and were given Roll of Honor Certificates, as 
follows: 
Miss Rose Wallace, Harriman, Tenn. 
Miss Celia Pearsall, Harriman, Tenn. 
Miss Marie Morris, Lancing, Tenn. 
Mr. W. D. Newton, Harriman, Tenn. : 
The following were given Primary Institute Certificates: 
Miss Bessie Christian, Harriman, Tenn. 
Miss Maude Barnard, Harriman, Tenn. 
Miss Lou Cochran, Harriman, Tenn. 
Miss Fay Roeder, Athens, Tenn. 
Mrs. G. H. Duthie, Harriman, Tenn.

Mr. 8. L. King, Tomotley, Tenn. 
Mr. C. M. Turney, Harriman, Tenn. 
In closing this report permit me to suggest the following in 
the interest of larger attendance and uniformity in grading: 
1. The State Institutes should begin at the same time, not 
later than the first Monday in June, and all should close on the 
same day. 
2. The County Superintendent of the county in which the 
State Institute is located should be required to give the State 
Institute hearty support, and should not be permitted to conduct 
County Normals during its session. 
3. The questions used in the examinations should be prepared 
by the State Superintendent or by the State Board of Education, 
and should be uniform throughout the State.

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE, 
McMINNVILLE, TENNESSEE, 
JUNE 12, FOUR WEEKS. 
Sir: I beg leave to submit herewith a report of the State Pea- 
body Institute held. at McMinnville, Tenn., thissummer. Being 
so removed, both in time and space, from the Institute, I am the 
better prepared to report its proceedings without the coloring of 
local environment. Iam impressed with the wisdom of locating 
the Institute in so charming a place. Its beautiful mountain 
scenery, its delightful and healthful climate, together with its ” 
cultured inhabitants, render it a peculiarly appropriate place for 
the weary and overworked teachers to assemble for study and the 
interchange of ideas. Such scenes and opportunities for reflec- 
tion are calculated to give new life and inspiration for the great 
work of educating the people. 
The Institute commenced on June 12 and extended through 
a period of four weeks. The Institute was conducted the first 
week by our distinguished Dr. W. R. Garrett; thereafter the 
duties of Conductor devolved on the writer. 
A review of the work of the Institute would show forth a 
month’s earnest labor on the part of teachers and Instructors. 
The enrollment shows an attendance of 109 persons. It was 
the purpose of the Faculty to enroll only such persons as were 
legally entitled to the privileges of the Institute. With a less 
definite purpose, the enrollment might have been somewhat 
greater. ‘ 
The conflict in the time of holding the Peabody Institute with 
the County Institutes rendered it necessary for some of those 
who had enrolled in the Peabody Institute to return to their re- 
spective counties, and it prevented others from enrolling who 
would otherwise have done so. 
The Secondary Course was not given, as it was necessary for - 
: oes

Secondary examination could be taken. Primary certificates 
were issued to the following persons:

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE, 
UNION CITY, TENNESSEE, 
JUNE 5, FOUR WEEKS. 
Sir: I have the honor to submit the report of the State Pea- 
body Institute held under my direction at Union City, Tenn. 
Owing to the existence of smallpox in the city, the attendance 
was much smaller than it would otherwise have been. We had, 
however, an enthusiastic body of teachers, and I think that ex- 
cellent work was done. I desire to commend the members of 
the Faculty for the zeal they brought to the work and the interest: 
which they inspired in their hearers. County Superintendent 
R. L. Bynum rendered most valuable assistance, being present at 
every session of the Institute and doing some excellent teaching. 
Rev. F. J. Tyler, of Union City, gave two fine lectures on “ How 
to Read the Bible.” Prof. James A. Tate, of Dyer, gave an ad- 
dress on “ Christian Education.” The music of the Institute 
was under the direction of Mr. G. D. Smith, of Union City. 
The total enrollment was 132. The number examined. was 
60, and the number of certificates issued was 29. This small 
number of certificates was partly due to the fact that a large 
number entered too late to get the required number of days.

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE, 
GREENEVILLE, TENNESSEE, 
JULY 3 TO JULY 28, 1899. 
Sir: The following I most respectfully submit as my report of 
the State Peabody Institute held at Greeneville, beginning on 
- July 3 and closing on July 28, 1899: 
Tn the very beginning I would state that this Institute was 
located altogether in new territory; and while experimental, yet 
its unparalleled success fully exemplified your wise discretion 
and good judgment in the selection of Greeneville as the most 
suitable place in East Tennessee. 
On my arrival; I found the Instructors on the ground, eager 
and ready for the work; the teachers, assembling from twenty 
counties; and a genuine and hospitable people with open doors, 
anxious to receive and aid us to their very utmost. The cordial 
reception extended us, the splendid opening, and the deep in- 
_ terest manifested in the Institute by both citizens and teachers 
were quite enough to assure us that a telling work could be done, 
and that a profitable and successful Institute would result. 
This being the first State Institute located at this place, we 
found no teachers holding certificates entitling them to Second- 
ary grades; hence our work was confined altogether to the Pri- 
mary. Our plan of instruction, therefore, was mostly by reci- 
tation—in other words, a Normal School—each subject receiving 
close and practical attention under the supervision of careful 
and competent Instructors, who placed their work neatly upon 
the board, and in a professional manner demonstrated whereof 
they taught. The curriculum as prescribed by law was faith- 
fully followed, and no energies were spared whereby teachers 
untried or experienced might be benefited. In truth, our chief 
endeavor was to make this Institute typical of a first-class school- 
room. 
Two sessions were held each day, opening at 8: 30 A.M. and 
Boge

-P-A-G-E-98
—91— 
closing at 4: 30 P.M., most of the time being given to essential, 
practical work, each study occupying its own appropriate hour. 
In this division of work, Prof. A. D. Wharton, of the Nash- 
ville High School, had charge of the Mathematics and Reading; 
L, $. London, Superintendent of the Bristol Schools, of United 
States History, Geography, and Orthography; W. W. Matney, 
Superintendent of the Greeneville Schools, in charge of Gram- 
mar and Physiology; C. 8. Douglass, of the Gallatin Schools, 
of Tennessee History, School Management, and School Law. 
I certainly feel that you were very fortunate in the selection 
of the Faculty assigned me, and would cheerfully state that they 
did their whole duty, being thoroughly alive to the work, fully 
competent, harmonious, and energetic. 
There were in attendance 270 teachers during the Institute, 
among them many representative educators of that portion of 
the State. At the close of the Institute there was held an ex- 
amination of three days, which was pointed and practical. One 
hundred and fourteen applied for certificates, only seventy being 
successful. 
I would note as a very important feature of this Institute the 
large number of directors who, responding to a circular letter 
from the Conductor, were present upon the day assigned them, 
manifesting a deep interest in school matters and giving pro- 
found attention to the very practical and interesting address of 
the State Superintendent, who so ably handled the school law 
and the new book system. Assuredly the teachings upon that 
occasion will be felt in many schools and will result in much 
good. 
We were pleased during the session to be visited by many 
eminent educators, who, by encouragement and kind expressions 
of appreciation, did us much good—notably, Rev. Dr. Spence, 
of Harriman University; Dr. Moore, of Tusculum College; 
Superintendent McCallie, Knoxville Schools; Dr. Mellin, of 
the University of Tennessee; Dr. Graybill, Professors Hender- 
son, Sayler, Vaught, Wolford, and many others. 
There was a new and very interesting departure in the securing 
and publication of one-half of the East Tennessee News, which,
-P-A-G-E-99
Poe 
socially and historically, added greatly to the interest; and we 
certainly feel very much indebted to the efficient editorial staff, 
composed of Professors Thompson and Pierce, and Misses Trim, 
Fitzgerald, and Cloyd. They certainly did a good work. In 
this connection, we mention with pleasure the many courtesies 
extended the Institute by the local press; nor would we forget 
the deep interest and valuable aid rendered by Hon. W. E. F. 
Milburn and Rev. J. S. Jones. 
There was no lack of enthusiasm from the very opening, as 
evinced by the large audiences attending our daily exercises; 
and the generous and hospitable citizenship of the beautiful 
mountain city spared no efforts whereby the Institute might be 
made a success, and the sojourn of the teachers in their midst 
be happy and pleasant. f 
We were glad that you, as the representative of our schools, 
honored us with two visits, and we feel that your presence and 
your practical words to the people and the teachers did much 
good to the cause of education. 
We submit the following summary: 
Institute opened on July 3, 1899. 
Institute closed on July 28, 1899. 
Number of days in session, 20. 
Number of days in examination, 3.

In conclusion, I would emphatically reiterate my opinion as 
heretofore so often expressed: that I know of no agency of our 
school system by which more good can be accomplished than 
_ through our Summer Institutes. It is through these that a more 
thorough organization can be had in the profession, a higher and 
purer sentiment among the teachers engendered, the instruc- 
tion and codperation of the people obtained, and, in truth, the 
upbuilding of the system all along the line. Surely but a few
-P-A-G-E-101
Oa 
more years of continued liberality on the part of our General 
Assembly, aided by the generous and untiring efforts of the very 
efficient agent of the Peabody Fund—Dr. Curry—with a wide- 
awake and energetic corps of teachers, we will be enabled to 
place Tennessee abreast of any in the sisterhood of States.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS. 
Your Committee begs leave to submit the following report: 
1. Resolved, That the thanks of this Institute are due and 
are hereby tendered Superintendent Morgan ©. Fitzpatrick for 
the very kind favors shown to the teachers and to the people of 
upper East Tennessee in the selection of Greeneville as the 
place for holding the present term of the Peabody State Normal 
Institute; also for the timely visits and the most opportune in- 
structions given by him to the teachers, directors, and County 
Court, as to matters pertaining to the Public School Law in all 
its bearings ; and that we hail with delight the good work already 
bearings; and that we hail with delight the good work already 
begun in our midst, and pray that the State Superintendent may 
consider our claims and give us the Normal Institute in the year 
1900. We hereby pledge our hearty support to make it, in all’ 
respects, a success. 
2. Resolved, That we tender our most hearty thanks to Con- 
ductor C. S. Douglass and his most accomplished and efficient 
Faculty for the impartial manner in which they have conducted 
the sessions of the Institute, and that we express our apprecia- 
tion of the thoroughness of the work done by each in the work 
assigned him. It is but the beginning of a great and good work 
in Greene County and adjoining counties. It is to be hoped that 
the methods given in school government, theory and practice of 
teaching and recitations, may be emulated by each and every 
teacher in attendance. 
3. Resolved, That we return to Professors Wharton and Lon- 
don our sincere thanks for their soul-cheering, soul-stirring 
music, which revived our oft-drooping spirits. We would not 
forget to mention the services of Miss Julia Kate Maloney, who
-P-A-G-E-102
cole 
has so ably and gracefully presided at the organ. Long will the 
faces of these faithful workers be stamped upon the minds of the 
Greeneville Normalites. 
+. Resolved, That we tender our sincere thanks to the pastor 
and the members of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church for 
the very kind and generous way in which they have treated the 
Institute in permitting us to use their church building during 
the sessions of this Normal. They, too, have been helping a 
* good cause. 
5. Resolved, That we hereby express our thanks to the South- 
ern Railway officials for the kindness shown to our members in 
reduced rates; to the ministers of Greeneville for their interest, 
help, and appreciation of a cause so dear to our hearts; to the 
citizens of the city, and especially the ladies, for the very kind, 
generous, and hospitable way in which they have received and 
entertained us during our sojourn among them. ‘The occasion 
will ever be as a happy oasis in the desert of life. 
6. Resolved, That we express our thanks to the Greeneville 
press for the courtesy and aid they have given in our Normal 
work. May God bless the editors and give their papers a wide 
circulation. 
7. Resolved, That we thank the honorable Board of Mayor 
and Aldermen and the County Court and School Directors for 
the substantial support rendered the Institute. 
8. Resolved, That we express our thanks to Prof. W. F. Guth- 
vie and Miss Mary Trim for the faithful and efficient way in 
which they have performed the duties assigned them as secre- 
taries. Respectfully submitted,

NASHVILLE. 
Sir: I have the honor to submit to you my report of the State 
Peabody Institute for the Colored Teachers of Middle Tennessee. 
The Institute opened in the Pearl High School building on 
Monday, June 12, at 10 o’clock A.M., and at 8 o’clock A.M. each 
school day thereafter till July 1. I, with my three assistants— 
J. W. Johnson, C. B. Lowe, and J. C. Crawley—were present 
at the opening, and continued on duty daily till the close of the 
Institute, excepting Lowe, who was absent one day on account of 
sickness. 
Two hundred and twelve teachers were enrolled. 
Tnstruction was given in both Primary and Secondary Courses. 
Sixty-eight took the Primary examination, eighteen making 
85 per cent and above. No Secondary examination was given, 
none being entitled to it. 
I also submit resolutions passed by vote of the Institute: 
1. We hereby thank Hon. Morgan C. Fitzpatrick, Superin- 
tendent of Public Instruction, for creating and maintaining a 
State Normal Institute for colored teachers, and especially for 
locating one at Nashville; and for the able corps of Instructors 
in the persons of T. A. Fortson, Conductor, and J. W. Johnson, 
C. B. Lowe, and J. C. Crawley, assistants. 
2. Because of the central location, size, attraction, and advan- 
tages of Nashville, as evidenced by the large attendance at this 
Institute, we most respectfully petition the State Superintendent _ 
to locate next summer’s Institute here in Nashville, in order that 
the many taking the Primary examination this year may have 
an opportunity to take the Secondary next year.

‘ UNION CITY. 
Sir: We beg to transmit herewith our report of the State Pea- 
body Institute for Colored Teachers for West Tennessee. The 
attendance was not as large as we hoped it would be, on account 
of the presence of smallpox in the city. What was lacking, how- 
ever, in quantity, we tried to make up in quality, in interest, in 
enthusiasm, and in hard work. The teachers present and the 
citizens of this community appreciate your kindness in locating 
the Institute at this place, as shown by the resolution attached 
tothis report. We trust you will give some of its features a care- 
ful perusal. Our Institute had the full support of the white 
“Institute of this city, and we were aided by lectures and recita- 
tions from members of that body. Too much praise cannot be 
given Dr. J. I. D. Hinds, Profs. J. L. Brooks, J. W. Sewell, R. 
L. Bynum, W. H. Cook, and others, for their help and codpera- 
tion. ‘The number of teachers enrolled was fifty-one. The col- 
ored pastors of the city were in daily attendance, and addresses 
were made by Revs. E. W. Mosely, G. W. Morgan, B. F. 
Stone, and J. M. Holt. The general impression is that great 
good has been done this section of the State, and influences set 
in motion which will result in the improvement of the teachers, 
pupils, and the public schools. You will find the names and ex- 
amination marks on the official sheet of those entitled to State 
certificates. We hope you will be willing to locate the Institute 
here next year, and give those who have passed an opportunity 
to win a Secondary certificate. It is the unanimous wish of all 
that the interest shown and the hard work done shall merit your 
approval by a second appointment here. The Institute was har- 
monious in its labors, and we wish to thank our assistants for 
their cordial support. i

HARTSVILLE.   
Sir: I have the honor to submit the report of the joint Insti- 
tute for colored teachers, held at Hartsville, Tenn., beginning 
on June 12 and continuing one week. I was ably assisted by 
R. R. Burnley. Being satisfied that our teachers were not 
sufficiently prepared, our plan of instruction was by recitation. 
Each study in the Primary Course received its allotted time, 
care, and attention. There being no Secondary applicants, we 
gave all the time to Primary work. Two sessions were held 
each day and one each night. The total number of teachers 
enrolled, as shown in the Minutes, was thirty-one. 
There was a deep interest manifested by the citizens, for not 
a session was held but that we had a good representation of the 
people. 
Mr. Lytle Dalton, the County Superintendent, showed an in- 
terest by his presence and work. Prof. A. D. Wharton, of 
Nashville, and other white gentlemen addressed the Institute; 
but especially would I mention the visit of the State Superin- 
tendent and the strong and telling words addressed by him to 
the teachers upon school legislation, the purposes of such Tnsti- 
tutes, and the cultivation of patriotism among the men and 
women of this age. It was the consensus of opinion of all the 
teachers present that the Superintendent’s remarks were both 
timely and instructive. 4 
These Institutes and the work accomplished by them I regard 
as prime factors in the educational growth of the State.

A very successful State Institute for the colored teachers of 
East Tennessee was held at Knoxville at the same time and un- 
der the same regulations as those for the colored at Nashyille and 
Union City. A full‘report of its proceedings was not received 
in time to appear in this report.

REPORT TO DR, CURRY. 
STATE OF TENNESSEE, 
Department or Pustic Iysrruction, 
Nashville, September 11, 1899. 
Dr. J. L. M. Curry, General Agent Peabody Education Fund, 
Washington, D. C. 
Sir: I submit herewith the annual report of the State Superin- 
tendent of Public Instruction of Tennessee for the year just 
ended. This report embraces the entire work of State Peabody 
Institutes in Tennessee—those aided in part by your Board and 
by the State. The present incumbent of this office did not 
assume its duties until April of this year, and, therefore, did not 
have at his command such information as was desirable and 
necessary; but he is pleased to report to you, and through you 
to your Board of Trustees, that the work in Tennessee has been 
most satisfactory. 
The State Institutes for white teachers were located at Me 
Minnville and Dickson, in Middle Tennesee ; Jackson and Union 
City, in West. Tennessee; Harriman and Greeneville, in East 
Tennessee. Heretofore only four or five State Peabody Insti- 
tutes have been held in the State; but I found that more teachers 
would attend and that more general satisfaction would result 
from the location of two Institutes in each grand division of the 
State. By directing your attention to the geography of this 
State, you will see that the six points named are as near as possi- 
ble conveniently located and distributed among the counties in 
the State. 
The State Peabody Institutes for colored teachers were located 
at Nashville, in Middle Tennessee; at Union City, in West Ten- 
nessee; and at Knoxville, in East Tennessee. The colored teach- 
ers being numerically very much fewer than the whites, it was 
not thought wise and best to locate more than one Institute in 
each grand division for them. In upper East Tennessee there 
are entire counties where the colored population is not sufficient 
to justify the teaching of a half dozen schools, and the same is 
—109—
-P-A-G-E-117
—110— 
almost true in many of the Middle Tennessee counties. It is 
gratifying to know and to report to you that the attendance at 
the Institutes for both races has exceeded that in any prior year. 
The State Legislature has heretofore appropriated $1,500 per 
annum for the aid of Institute work in the State, but at its last 
session it increased its appropriation from $1,500 to $2,500 per 
annum, which, with the $1,200 so generously tendered by your 
Board of Trust, made the Institute fund for this year and next 
$3,700. In addition to this fund, the six towns and cities in 
which were located the Institutes for white teachers each gave 
$150, which, added to the $2,500 appropriated by the State, and 
$1,200 by your Board of Trust, gave us this year $4,600 as an 
Tnstitute fund. I employed four Instructors for each Institute, 
and endeavored to select for these positions the ablest, most ex- 
perienced, and most successful teachers within this State, and 
their work at each Institute has proven the propriety and judi- 
ciousness of their selection. I used the $900 given by the six 
towns and cities in aiding the Institutes for both white and col- 
ored teachers in the respective grand divisions of the State. TI 
likewise used the $1,200 given by you for such Institutes. The © 
-money given by you was expended as follows: 
Institute at Greeneville ............ $160 00 
Mnstitute.a hyrbarnimani esate iacave-e.s. 0 160 00

Tt will thus be seen that it was my purpose to locate the Insti- 
tutes in such manner as would make them most accessible to the 
greatest number of teachers, and to expend the money equitably 
between the races according to numbers and population. 
T submit herewith the report of the Conductors for the white 
and colored Institutes, respectively. These reports set out in 
detail the work of each Institute and the particular method em- 
ployed.

COUNTY INSTITUTES. 
Interest in educational work has greatly increased during the 
past two years in this State, and now there is a live, active Teach- 
ers’ Association in most of the counties in each grand division. 
In every Institute, State and County, expressions of gratitude’ 
have been made by the teachers because of the continued gener- 
osity of the Peabody Board of Trust in uniformly aiding the 
work in tkis State. 
PEABODY NORMAL COLLEGE. 
The Peabody Normal College, located in the city of Nash- 
ville, has just closed the most prospercus term in its history. 
There were enrolled in the Peabody Normal College proper, dur- 
ing the last year, 604 students, which, with those attending the 
Winthrop Model School, its preparatory department, made an 
enrollment of more than 900 students. This enumeration does 
not include students attending either the Medical College or the 
College of Music which are under the management of the Presi- 
dent of the Peabody Normal College, because as such he is 
made Chancellor of the University of Nashville also. The en- 
tire membership of the Peabody Normal College and the Uni- 
versity of Nashville for the year just ended was more than 1,500 
students in actual attendance. These students speak in stronger 
language than any which I could employ of the successful man- 
agement and continued prosperity of this great Institution. 
Dr. Payne has been particularly effective in sustaining the repu- 
tation of this institution for excellence, thoroughness, and capa- 
bility in teaching. Its students are filling positions of honor, 
trust, importance, and-responsibility in almost every hamlet and 
neighborhood in the South. Wherever they have worked in 
Tennessee, the superior, capable, and satisfactory manner in 
which the students of this college have performed their duties 
has been most excellent testimony to the work performed by 
the faculty in this institution. 
When this college first located in Nashville, no appropriation 
was made by the State. In 1881, however, the State Legisla- 
ture appropriated $10,000 annually to aid this institution, and
-P-A-G-E-119
—112— 
a few years later increased the appropriation to $15,000. In 
1895 the Chair of American History was established, and the 
Legislature gave an additional appropriation of $5,000 per an- 
num for that subject, making the entire appropriation of the 
- State for this institution $20,000 per annum, which appropria- 
tion was continued by the last Legislature. The people of Ten- 
nessee are grateful to you, the honored agent and representative 
.of the Peabody Board of Trust, as they are also to that Board, 
for the continued generosity which you and your Board have 
continually manifested for this institution, the people of this 
State, and the whole South. 
IT hope I am not mistaken in believing that your Board will 
find a hearty codperation on the part of the resident Boards here 
who are interested in this institution, and from the people 
throughout the State. I believe that Tennessee will in the 
future, as in the past, assume every responsibility and respond to 
every expectation of you and your Board. We desire to co- 
operate with you in making this institution a continued success, 
and in keeping on persistently until, with one aim and one idea 
and purpose, we ean make the Peabody Normal College second 
in attendance, second in power and importance, to no institu- 
tion in our country. 
I have the honor to be, 
Yours very truly, 
MORGAN C. FITZPATRICK.

FROM 
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
ANDERSON COUNTY. 
  
E. C. Cross, Superintendent. 
  
The Anderson County Teachers’ Institute was held at Clin- 
ton, beginning on July 10, 1899, and continuing two weeks. 
The Institute was conducted by Profs. J. W. Hyden and C. W. 
Stuart, under whose instruction much interest was manifested 
and great benefit derived by the teachers who attended. The 
interest among the teachers was better than for many years, and 
we hope to be able to show better work this year than ever before. 
BEDFORD COUNTY. 
Louis Wilhoite, Superintendent. 
  
The general condition of education in the county is favorable. 
The teachers are interested in Institute work, and the attendance 
at Institutes is perfectly satisfactory. The Bedford County 
.Teachers’ Institute donates every dollar coming into its treasury 
to a Teachers’ Library, the result being a good library of good 
books, * 
BENTON COUNTY. 
D. B. Gossett, Superintendent. 
  
The Benton County Teachers’ Institute met at Camden on 
June 26, 1899, and continued in session until July 1. Superin- 
So

tendent Gossett presided. The Secretaries were V. C. Nunnery 
and Miss Donna Ward. There were present over sixty-five 
teachers. Live subjects were discussed, and the discussions were 
full of life, vim, and interest. A more profitable and enjoyable 
gathering of teachers was never before held in the county. 
Prominent among the visitors not engaged in teaching were 
Hon. D. G. Hudson and Hon. Thos. C. Rye, who delivered able 
addresses to the assembled teachers. A committee, composed 
of B. D. Johnson, D. J. Allen, and T. W. Cuff, was appointed. 
to wait upon the County Court and ask for an appropriation for 
a ‘Teachers’ Library.. Ex-Superintendent Allen said: “ This _ 
has been the most successful Institute in Benton’s history.” 
BLEDSOE COUNTY. 
  
Miss Lilly M. Henry, Superintendent. 
The annual Teacher’s Institute for Bledsoe County was held 
at Pikeville, beginning on June 26 and ending on June 30, 
1899. It was conducted by Miss Lilly M. Henry. There were 
fifty teachers in attendance. Every teacher having a position — 
in the county, except three, attended this Institute. : 
BLOUNT COUNTY. 4 
J. F. Iddins, Superintendent. 
    
The Annual Teachers’ Institute was held at Maryville ‘Col- 
‘lege, beginning on June 26, 1899, and ending on June 30. 
Profs. J. C. Barnes, H. HE. Ellis, and M. H. Gamble were the 
Instructors. The enrollment was about one hundred teachers. 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
te 
Local Institutes have been held twice a month, and a mass 
meeting of teachers and directors for the whole county was held. 
The attendance at these meetings has not been satisfactory, but 
the interest has been good. Our schools are progressing nicely. 
BRADLEY ‘COUNTY. 
Horace W. Morelock, Superintendent. 
  
The Teachers’ Institute of Bradley County was in session at 
Charleston from July 17 to July 31, 1899. It was conducted 
by Miss Flora Fitzgerald, Superintendent of Gibson County, 
assisted by Superintendent Morelock. Miss Fitzgerald had 
charge of the Primary field, and her excellent work made a last- 
ing impression upon our teachers. Among the visitors were: 
Professor Burke, of Grant University; Superintendent James 
G. Paul, of Meigs County; Prof. D. A. Stanfield, of James 
County; Prof. R. Weeks, of McMinn County; and Col. OC. W. 
Lester, of Cleveland. The Secretary of the Institute was Miss 
Lizzie Trewhitt; the organist, Miss Lizzie Bryant. On Di- 
rectors’ Day a number of directors attended the Institute and 
showed a disposition to codperate in the educational work of the 
county. The following resolutions were adopted: 
Resolved, That we return our most sincere thanks to Hon. 
Morgan C. Fitzpatrick, State Superintendent, for favoring 
Bradley County Institute with State aid, and for sending to us 
such an efficient: Institute rorker as Nee Fitzgerald, of Gibson 
County. 
Resolved, That we thank Miss Fitzgerald for her most valu- 
able service, her Institute work, Primary methods, and her 
many practical suggestions, and that we wish her unbounded 
success in her future work. 
A Reading Circle has been organized, and teachers are urged 
to join and partake of its numerous advantages.
-P-A-G-E-125
1s — 
The following instructions to directors have been issued by 
Superintendent Morelock: 
“ Section 26, page 20, of the new School Law says: ‘ Every 
teacher in a public school shall keep a daily register of facts 
pertaining to his or her school, in such form as the school regu- 
lations shall require, and shall be responsible for the safe-keep- 
ing and delivery of the same to the clerks of the school district 
at the close of the school term, or the period of his or her services, 
whichever shall first happen.” 
“This is law, and we should strictly abide by it; therefore, 
issue no warrant to any one, under any circumstances, until you 
have received the monthly report due you. Do not: issue war- 
rant for the last month’s services until the abstract has been filled 
out, one copy sent you, one to me, and T have acknowledged re- 
ceipt. This means that each teacher must keep a daily record. 
“T shall hold the directors responsible for any failure to get 
all abstracts, and will under no consideration issue warrants for 
scholastic population for 1900 until every abstract due me is in. 
“Tssue no contracts until you are presented with certificate 
of qualification. This must be observed. Visit your schools 
frequently. This is a part of your official duty. Stand by 
your teacher in promoting the best interests of your school. If 
you have made the wrong selection, do better next time.” 
In 1900 the Institute will meet at Cleveland, .on July 2, and 
will continue two weeks. The services of the following In- 
structors have already been secured: D. C. Arnold, J. A. Trew- 
hitt, J. C. Fooshee, and Miss Leah Fletcher. 
CAMPBELL COUNTY. 
  
P. G. Childress, Superintendent. 
  
Interest in educational affairs is increasing in this county. 
The annual Teachers’ Institute was held at Jacksboro from 
July 5 to July 18, 1899. Besides having a large number of 
   
-P-A-G-E-126
—119— 
visiting friends with us, we enrolled over a hundred teachers. 
All the teachers in the county, except two or three, were in at- 
tendance. 
The many local Institutes held in various parts of the county 
have done much good in awakening enthusiasm in both patrons 
and teachers. : 
By the cobperation of officers having charge of the school 
funds, we have, by a judicious management of the same, in- 
creased the average school term from fifty-five to seventy-five 
days, and at the same time raised school warrants to par from a 
discount of 25 or 80 per cent. We now have a surplus of nearly 
$2,000 in the treasury. 
This year the County Court has wisely raised the assessment 
for school purposes. 
Among other favorable signs noticeable is the improvement 
in school buildings and furniture. Neat, comfortable, and 
durable houses are fast taking the place of those long since past 
the age of repair. 
  CANNON COUNTY. 
Miss Ina B. Smithson, Superintendent. 
Our County Institute opened on Monday morning, July 26, 
1899, in the Academy Building, in Woodbury. The people of 
Woodbury and vicinity gave their daily presence as an apprecia- 
tion of earnest efforts to make the Institute a success; and such 
it was pronounced by one and all. 
I selected as my Conductor a man of ability, experience, and 
success, both as a teacher and Conductor of Institutes—Prof. 
R. L. Smithson, of Bardwell. Ky. He conducted the work in a 
manner very pleasing to the audience and very profitable to the 
teachers. It was something entirely new in Institute work. 
_He explained fully the object of Institutes. i 
We were complimented by a great many for the interest
-P-A-G-E-127
—120— 
shown by the teachers, not only by their daily attendance, but 
by the part they took in the work. It was said to have been the 
best-attended and the most profitable Institute ever held in our 
county, the kindest and most courteous attention being given. 
There were about seventy teachers enrolled during the week. 
The teachers organized themselves into an Association, to 
meet semimonthly; but their first meeting showed but little 
interest, and I am afraid my efforts to keep it up are in vain. I 
shall endeavor to establish a Teachers’ Library. 
Education in, Cannon County has fallen to a very low ebb. 
I trust I may be able to raise it to a higher standard than it has 
ever been in the past. 
CARROLL COUNTY. 
  
7. M. Hampton, Superintendent. 
  
Our Institute work is done under the name “ The Carroll 
County Teachers’ Association,” which meets at different places 
in the county where the educational interest has been sufficiently 
aroused to induce the teachers and patrons to ask the organiza- 
tion to come into their locality. We held four meetings during 
the year just closed—one of three days’ duration, and the other 
thrée of two days each, making a total of nine days’ Institute 
work within the year. The enrollment was seventy-nine white 
teachers, most of whom expressed themselves as having been 
benefited by the work. ; 
We are trying monthly meetings of one day each this year, 
and are trying at each meeting to induce our teachers to agree 
for all meetings to be held at the county seat and in the court- 
house. ; 
We also asked the teachers to vote for a membership fee of 
$1 and annual dues of $1 per capita, said money to be ex-_ 
pended in purchasing books for, and the equipping of, a Teach-
-P-A-G-E-128
ta 
ers’ Library. This was voted down by those present at our last 
meeting; but there are many good, progressive teachers who 
are working for this plan, and we hope to be able to report some- 
thing of the kind by the beginning of the next school year. 
CARTER COUNTY. 
  
M. D, Allen, Superintendent. 
Tam glad to say our schools are improving. I held a County 
Normal the first part of. July, 1898, which was well attended ~ 
by teachers, directors, and patrons. Almost every teacher in 
the county attended. TI also held several local Institutes during 
the term. Nearly all the teachers read school journals. The 
improvement in methods and the increase in. attendance have 
been very gratifying. 
Our Normal this year (1899) was one of the best we have 
ever had. -Nearly all the teachers of the county attended all 
the time. It was the universal expression of the teachers at the 
close that the work done this year was the best we had ever had, 
and that they were determined to teach better schools this year 
than they had ever taught. 
Prof. Charles Mason, our Conductor, did most. excellent 
work. It is always a treat for the teachers of Carter County 
to have him with them. 
The following resolutions were adopted: 
Resolved, That we extend our thanks to Professors Hop- 
wood and McConnell, of Milligan College; Prof. J. H. Smith, 
of Holly Springs College; Rev. Pile, and Hon. ©. C. Collins 
for their apprepriate addresses. 
Resolved, further, That we extend our sincere thanks to the 
Superintendent of Public Instruction for aiding the Institute 
by sending Prof. Charles Mason to conduct the work. 
The County Court met the week following our Institute and
-P-A-G-E-129
eee 
raised the levy on property ten cents and on polls twenty-five 
cents, which will give us an increase in the school fund of more 
than $2,000. 
The interest in school affairs in this county is better now than 
it has ever been. TI visited all the schools of the county (some 
of them several times), talked to the directors and patrons, and 
urged them to take more interest in the schools. The public 
meetings I held in different sections of the county have not been 
without good results. 
CHEATHAM COUNTY. 
Philip Hf. Duke, Superintendent. 
The Teachers’ Institute of Cheatham County was held during 
the first week in July, 1899. The Conductor, Superintendent 
Duke, was assisted by a corps of efficient and enthusiastie In- 
structors who had made special preparation for the work they 
_ presented. The Instructors were: Grammar, Prof. M. E,. 
Moore; United States History, J. H. Judd; Tennessee His- 
tory, J. Hi. Dunn; Arithmetic, R. N. Thompson; Geography, 
A. T. Felts; Theory and Practice and School Law, Hon. L. J. 
Pardue; Pedagogy and Physiology, Superintendent Philip H. 
Duke. The work of the regular Instructors was supplemented. 
by excellent papers, recitations, and lectures by Misses Willie 
B. Pardue and Della Pardue; Mrs. Lillie Page; Messrs. J. L. 
Mayo, Arthur Hooper, and J. L. Teague. The teachers were 
favored daily with musical entertainment by a class under the 
direction of Miss Lizzie Jackson. 
Although it had been a very difficult matter to prevail upon 
the majority of our teachers to attend the monthly meetings, it 
is safe to say that we have had very few more profitable In- 
stitutes in the county. The interest manifested by the teachers 
at the outset did them credit, and the fact that it has continued
-P-A-G-E-130
=o 
to grow since the first day of the session is something to be appre- 
ciated, especially since it seems to have attained an attitude 
which promises to make it lasting. 
A set of resolutions were passed adopting a course of study 
consisting, of three books to be selected by a committee acting 
with the County Superintendent. ‘Nearly all the teachers en- 
tered into this work and made orders for books. Three suitable 
books will be placed at once in the hands of each teacher, and 
to these such others as may be thought needful will be added 
from year to year. With such a nucleus of a library in the 
hands of each teacher, we think that the prospect is fair that 
the study of Pedagogy will soon be realized in a higher sense 
than ever before by our teachers. : 
CHESTER COUNTY. 
  
C. B. Ijams, Superintendent. 
  
The school interests of the county are very much improved. 
The teachers, both white and colored, are awaking to their duty 
and are attending our Institutes. 
T am making a specialty of Institute work, and am holding 
Institutes in various parts of the county. 
School directors and patrons are becoming interested along 
the lines of education. : 
My constant endeavor will be to have our public schools para- 
mount to all other interests, and the hearty codperation of pat- 
rons and directors insures this most hopeful desire. 
CLAIBORNE COUNTY. 
  
A. N. Treece, Superintendent. 
  
The Claiborne County Teachers’ Institute was in session at 
Tazewell from June 12 to June 18, 1899; Conductor, J. C.
-P-A-G-E-131
oo tee 
Brogan. There were sixty-eight teachers in attendance. A 
number of the county’s prominent citizens were present and took 
part in the exercises, and the Institute was one of the most 
enjoyable and profitable ever held in the county. 
CLAY COUNTY. 
W. J. Cherry, Superintendent. 
  
A Téachers’ Institute was held at Celina from J uly 3 to July 
5, 1899. The results accomplished at this Institute were very 
- gratifying to all who attended it. It scemed that a willing and 
enthusiastic spirit was evinced by both the teachers and visitors. 
There were about forty teachers in attendance. The public at- 
tended well, and seldom, if ever, was such earnest attention 
given and interest shown in Institute work. The branches in 
the course of study in the public schools were discussed, with 
many other important educational topics. 
The teachers of Clay County have a very high appreciation of 
the excellent work done at this Institute. A new resolution, to- 
gether with a spirit to do better work, was inculeated into the 
mind of every teacher. This new beginning will no doubt add 
to the future progress of higher education. : 
The greatest obstacle in this county to progressive educa- 
tional work is a lack of school funds and better schoolhouses. 
It is hoped that the present embarrassing condition of schools 
in this county will be improved in the near future. The schools 
this year are progressing finely. 
The following was one of the resolutions adopted: 
Resolved, That we acknowledge our gratitude to the State 
Superintendent for the very able and enthusiastic Instructor 
‘that he secured for us. ; 
The Clay County Tribune, which made a liberal donation of 
space to the report of the Institute, said:

“R. W. Caldwell was the representative of the State authori- 
ties. He lives in Sumner County, a locality where schools have 
been kept‘to the front-for many years. His schoolroom expe- 
rience gives him a prestige due veterans. The State Superin- 
tendent made a good selection, for he filled a want. He advo- 
cated nothing but the purely practical, gave no lessons that 
might not be applied in daily work, and made friends of all. 
We are indeed glad he came.” 
COCKE COUNTY. 
F. W. Parrott, Superintendent. 
  
My year’s work as Superintendent of Schools for Cocke 
County has, I think, resulted in an improvement along the edu- 
cational line. I have complied with the instructions of the 
State Superintendent in all things. It is apparent to every one 
that the public schools of Cocke County—and, I should say, the 
State at large—have not been as effective as they should be. 
Having the responsibility of the condition of my schools upon 
me, I have studied the matter seriously, and have done my best 
to improve them. 
The natural result of an investigation of the inefficiency of 
the publie schools is a great lack of competency among the 
teachers. Realizing this, I have been very careful in licensing 
my teachers. Out of 120 who stood the first examination, I 
secured only sixty teachers, leaving my schools short about forty. 
The second examination gave me fifty applicants and six teach- 
evs. I then had to give the third examination, which brought 
out the retired and better qualified teachers and gave me suffi- 
cient teachers for my schools. I am glad to say that in visiting 
my schools I find them greatly improved. ec, 
The people would, I think, be glad to have an opportunity to 
vote the compulsory school law. Until this law is passed we 
will always have boys and girls growing up in ignorance.

COPFEE COUNTY. 
C. N. Townsend, Superintendent. 
The Coffee County Teachers’ Institute was held at Manches- 
ter from June 26 to June 30, 1899. H. H. Vincent acted as 
President; and W. P. Charles, Secretary. There were in at- 
tendance thirty Coffee County teachers and twenty visiting 
teachers. The Executive Committee, composed of H. H. Vin- 
cent, O. W. Martin, J. T. Ensey, W. P. Charles, and S. L. Phil- 
lips, rendered the County Superintendent efficient assistance in 
conducting the Institute. During the coming year teachers’ 
meetings will be held at different, points in the county. A 
Teachers’ Library Association will, it is hoped, be organized in 
a short time. f 
CROCKETT COUNTY. 
  
J. R. McDonald, Superintendent. 
Our people are manifesting more interest in school matters 
than heretofore. Our teachers are 100 per cent better than 
they were ten years ago. We have a number of good country 
schools, presided over by first-class teachers, who do most excel- _ 
lent work. 
Our annual Teachers’ Institute for white teachers was held 
at Alamo, commencing on June 19, 1899, and continuing for 
two weeks. The Institute was conducted by the County Super- 
intendent, assisted by J. W. Watkins, A. C. Patton, R. L. Con- 
ley, F. C. James, and Perey McDonald. Along the same lines ~ 
of work, I do not think it could be excelled in the State. The 
Institute was opened each morning by singing, prayer, roll call, 
and enrollment of new members. When a teacher’s name was 
called, he responded by giving a quotation. During the Insti- 
tute we had addresses by Hon. A. J. Collinsworth, Elder J. R.
-P-A-G-E-136
ley a 
Farrow, Hon. C. A. Goodloe, Mr. C. E. German; Professor 
Kinsland, of the Southern Normal University; Elder A. G. 
Freed, of the Georgie Robertson Christian College; and others. 
All were of the opinion that our Institute eclipsed anything of 
the kind ever before held in Crockett, County. 
An Institute for colored teachers was held at Alamo, begin- 
ning on June 12, 1899, and continuing for one week. The In- 
structors in this Institute were the colored teachers, J. M. D. 
Brown and J. H. Roberts. 
CUMBERLAND COUNTY. 
Sampson De Rossett, Superintendent. 
  
The school year just closed has been the most. profitable in the 
history of Cumberland County. The County Superintendent 
visited all the schools in the county, save one or two, and found 
the pupils well supplied with the necessary books, and the teach- 
ers full of life and energy, each striving to earn his salary. The 
directors and patrons were codperating and working with the 
teachers, thereby keeping peace and harmony in the schools and 
showing that they are interested in the education of their chil- 
dren. 
Our County Court is to be praised for continuing to levy the 
highest school tax possible. 
The annual Institute commenced on June 19, 1899, and con- 
tinued for one week. It was the most profitable and interesting 
ever held in the county. It was conducted by Dr. S. W. Tin- 
dall, of Carson and Newman College. Dr. Tindall says that 
he never saw teachers more willing to work than those attending 
this Institute. ; 
Cumberland County teachers are wide awake, and while our 
schools are in progress teachers’ meetings are held every Satur- 
day somewhere in the county. Teachers, directors, and patrons
-P-A-G-E-137

meet and discuss live school topics, and much interest is being 
manifested. Dinners on the ground are furnished by the ladies 
of the localities in which we meet, and these are occasions of 
pleasure and profit. 
DAVIDSON COUNTY. 
A. H. Wright, Superintendent. 
  
In submitting my seventh annual report, I am pleased to say 
that, by comparing with my last year’s report, you will note 
progress, both in enrollment and attendance, which we think to 
be evidence of increased interest in education. Our monthly 
meetings have been more interesting this year than ever before. 
The annual meeting, which was held at the Peabody Normal 
College, was more largely attended this year, and, I think, better 
results obtained than before. Taking everything into consid- 
eration, I think we are doing well. 
DECATUR COUNTY. 
B. A. Tucker, Superintendent. 
  
The regular annual Institute for Decatur County was held 
at Decaturville on July 3-7, 1899. Prof. M. R. Abernathy, of 
Selmer, was-the Conductor, assisted by his son, Prof. Terry 
Abernathy. On organization, J. A. Spence was elected Secre- 
tary. 
About forty teachers attended the Institute. Some of this 
number were visitors from adjoining counties. There were 
about twenty-five teachers that did not attend the Institute. 
The attendance was small, but the discussions were interest- 
y
-P-A-G-E-138
ee 
ing. Professor Abernathy held his reputation as an Institute’ 
Conductor by giving excellent talks on Primary Teaching, Read- 
ing, Geography, and Physiology. Prof. Terry Abernathy’s 
line of work was Tennessee History, United States History, 
Penmanship, and Arithmetic. His talks were plain, pointed, 
and practical. He handled his subjects with such familiarity 
that his lectures could be nothing but interesting. A number of 
our own teachers took an active part in the work. I would espe- 
cially mention G. W. Brasher, on Arithmetic, and J. C. Duck, 
on Grammar. The discussions were interspersed with music 
furnished by Miss Nellie England and Miss Nina Stout. 
There was an Institute held at the same time for the colored 
teachers. It was conducted by Prof. J. M. D. Brown, of Bells, 
Tenn. 
DEKALB COUNTY. 
J. E. Drake, Superintendent. 
  
The DeKalb County Institute was held in Smithville from 
July 3 to July 8, 1899. It was conducted by J. E. Drake, 
County Superintendent. The Instructors were: Profs. H. L. 
W. Gross, English Grammar and Language; R. C. Rose, Physi- 
ology; J. S. Woods, Geometry, Theory and Practice; J. F. Cap- 
linger, Arithmetic, History, and Civil Government; J. C. Estes, 
Algebra; Miss Martha Robinson, Reading; W. J. Gothard, 
Orthography; J. E. Drake, Writing and Bookkeeping; E. S. 
Lentz, Agriculture; Miss Ida Hancock, Primary Work; Ov B: 
Close, Philosophy. 
The Instructors presented their respective subjects very clear- 
ly and with much earnestness. The teachers to be examined 
were interested in the work, for they were always promptly in. 
their places after each intermission, and seemed to delight in 
the portion of the work that fell to them, as they. readily re- 9 :
-P-A-G-E-139

"sponded to every call. The number of teachers enrolled was 
401. 
The Colored Institute was conducted by Dr. W. H. Ballard, 
colored. Instructors: Thomas Officer and Elenora Williams. 
. Twenty teachers attended. 
The educational interest in the county is growing, although 
we have not the money to make our schools what they should be. 
Nevertheless, I believe, under the uniform system of text-books, 
with the time we shall gain, we shall soon be in a much better’ 
condition than we are at present. 
It has been my chiefest aim to comply with your instructions 
in reference to licensing teachers. 
DICKSON COUNTY. 
S. E. Hunt, Superintendent. 
The State Normal held at Dickson gave new life to the teach- 
ers of this county, there being about forty in attendance. 
The grade of teachers is improving, and a steady awakening 
of interest among the directors and people is being manifested. 
Several Institutes have been held, with fair attendance. 
I have looked to the perfecting of titles to publie school prop- 
erty. New houses have been built, old ones enlarged and re- 
paired, and quite a large part of them are equipped with mod- 
ern desks. 
TI have endeavored to have no teachers except. those who are 
qualified in point of scholarship, the test being a rigid, but fair, 
written examination. 
Upon the whole, I am glad to report that the educational con- 
dition of the county is improving.

Oe 
DYER COUNTY. 
  
T. C. Gordon, Superintendent. 
  
The city schools of our county are in a most flourishing con- 
dition, and all our county schools are fairly prosperous. Our 
directors have not been changed by the people for many years, | 
and their experience has made them successful men in handling 
the interests of their respective school districts. The schools 
are out of debt in every district, and the fund is ample to sus- 
tain the schools five months eaeh year in every district, with one 
or two exceptions. The majority of our teachers are to the 
manor born, the children of the best. farmers and business men 
of our county; and we encourage our own young folks to enter 
the work, as we feel that they are greatly interested -personally 
in the suecess and welfare of the schools of the county. After 
finishing the Primary schools at home, these teachers take a 
course at the Peabody Normal, at Nashville; or the Southern 
Normal, at Huntingdon ; or at the Dickson Normal; or at one of 
our county high schools, at Dyersburg or Newbern; and we 
think our teaching force ranks with the best in the State. 
Under direction from the State Superintendent, I had the 
County Court.to make the school and civil districts of the county 
coextensive, and I had great hopes for the good of the country 
schools from this change, but the experiment was not popular 
with the people, who had grown accustomed to separate school 
districts and a separate directory for each school, and the County 
Court changed back to the old school districts, and everything is 
moving on now as smoothly as before. 
Our schoolhouses are now nearly all supplied with good desks 
and blackboards, globes and maps. The chart fiends have been 
driven from the county with their forty-seven-dollar charts, the 
County Superintendent refusing to indorse any check they 
might get from any director whom they might delude. 
Our county schools are fully established in public favor, and 
our County Court has always responded to every request I made 
_ upon it for the schools.

FAYETTE COUNTY. 
  
T. T. Hardy, Superintendent. 
  
Tt is evident from the accompanying statistics that our public 
- schools throughout the county are steadily advancing, both as to 
interest manifested on the part of the people and the work done 
by the teachers. There is a growing demand for enterprising, 
progressive teachers, and a disposition on the part of directors 
‘to procure the services of only such teachers as have attended 
and graduated at a State Institute. As a result, the majority 
of our white teachers have been attending the Institute at Jack- 
son, and are paid better salaries for their services. 
Our colored teachers are doing noble work for their race, and 
many conduct their schools with efficiency, and are always very _ 
prompt in attending their monthly meetings and Institutes. 
The outlook for the future is indeed hopeful; the current of 
public favor flows surely and steadily in the direction of edu- 
cating the youth of the county. 
The public school fund cf our county is guarded with jealous 
care by B. F. Murrell, our County Trustee. 
‘FENTRESS COUNTY. 
James Smith, Superintendent. 
The Teachers’ Institute for Fentress County met at James- 
town from July 5 to July 14, 1899, with sixty-five teachers in 
attendance. It was conducted by Prof. A. J. Albertson.

FRANKLIN COUNTY. 
  
Miss Mattie Arledge, Superintendent. 
  
At no time has there been more interest manifested in the 
publie schools throughout Franklin County than during the 
past year. The Teachers’ Institute enrolled a larger member- 
ship than ever before in the history of the county, the interest 
‘ and attendance increasing with every day of its session. The 
programme was prepared so as to bring before the teachers sub- 
jects that were of the greatest importance and interest to them. 
Enthusiasm was not wanting, and every subject was entered into 
with a zeal and animation unusual in County Institutes. Much 
of the work was conducted by the teachers of the county (and 
well they did their tasks), but a number of the best teachers of 
the State were present, lending a helping hand and encouraging 
in many ways. 
The educational spirit thus aroused within the teacher seems 
to have been diffused through the entire community, bringing 
about a more perfect sympathy and codperation between teacher 
and patron, and consequently better atteiidance and better edu- 
cational results have been the outcome. 
‘A system of grading the schools of the county has been de- 
vised, and altogether educational affairs are slowly, but surely, 
putting on a better appearance. New and better schoolhouses, 
better school furniture and apparatus, are replacing the old in 
various parts of the county, showing an interest among the peo- 
ple generally, and we believe that the improvements along this 
line will steadily go forward from year to year as the people 
come to a realization of the importance that education is to play 
in the future welfare of the country.

' GIBSON COUNTY. 
Miss Flora Fitzgcrald, Superintendent. 
I take pleasure in submitting to your inspection my Fifth
-P-A-G-E-143
— 134— 
Annual Report of the school work in Gibson County. I have 
not depended entirely upon the clerks of the various districts for 
statistics relative to their schools, for very often such reports are ~ 
full of inaccuracies; but I made it a point to visit each of the 
schools under my supervision at least once during the scholastic 
year, and, while there, to make notes that often afterwards en- 
abled me to correct. such mistakes as occur in directors’ reports. 
I am glad to state that the schools of our county are well 
graded, and for fifteen years past they have had a uniform sys- 
tem of text-books. We have undoubtedly obtained excellent 
results from such order of gradation and text-books, and trust 
to obtain still better from State uniformity. Our schools just 
now are in a more prosperous condition than ever before, but 
we feel that we have vet much to accomplish. Our greatest 
needs are longer terms and fewer school districts. As I visit 
the schools I make notes of their needs, and send these, together 
with such suggestions as may benefit them, to the press of the 
county. 
This procedure has helped us wonderfully in improving the 
requirements of our schools. Our teachers, both white and col- 
ored, are organtzed into Associations, which mect monthly in 
different districts, or wherever, in our opinion, an educational 
revival is most needed. The programmes for these meetings 
are so arranged as to be interesting and instructive to both teach- 
ers and patrons. ‘The directors of our county are-organized, 
and, as a County ‘School Board, meet quarterly to consider the 
school interests of the county and to make such regulations as 
will, in their opinion, produce the best results. This School 
Board, at its April meeting, decided that $100 ought to be ap- © 
propriated for Institute work in the county. The County 
Court readily granted the appropriation, and, as a result, we 
held a two-weeks’ County Normal each, for white and colored 
teachers. 
The last two weeks of June were devoted to our annual ren 
son County Normal. We were so fortunate as to secure for 
Conductor Capt. C. S. Douglass, of Gallatin, a member of the 
State Board of Education, and who had on two previous ocea-
-P-A-G-E-144
135. = 
sions served this county in the same capacity. The Institute 
was characterized by everything conducive to professional im- 
provement and an enthusiastic ambition on the part of our teach- 
ers to occupy the front rank in the onward mareh of educational 
advancement. Much to our regret, Captain Douglass was called - 
awdy at the close of the first week to meet the Text-book Com- 
mission: © 4Prot.; He ie: Mendenhall, of the Humboldt City 
Schools, conducted the Institute for the remainder of the time 
in such an able manner as to elicit the warmest commendation 
from all present. We enrolled one hundred and _ sixty-five 
teachers. Our Instructors were selected from among the best 
teachers of the county and with an eye to their especial fitness 
for the work assigned them— E. L. Mendenhall, H. L. 
Higgs, W. 8. Hess, A. D. Hassell, C. S. Henning, J. B. Cum- 
mings, J. W. Meadows, C. P. Jester, and Misses Sallie Blake- 
more, Ella Orr, and Mamie Banks. This was undoubtedly the 
most successful and most profitable Normal Gibson County has 
yet had, and, as a natural consequence, we are expecting excel- 
lent results from the work done by our teachers this year. 
  The Normal for colored teachers was in session the second 
and third weeks in Jaume, and was conducted by three of the most 
competent colored teachers in the county—viz. : T. M. Stegall, 
A. J. Collins, and G. W. Porter. The character of work done 
wus truly gratifying, every teacher of the county being in at- 
tendance every day. Over eighty teachers. were enrolled. At 
the close an examination was held. Many of the teachers took 
Secondary examinations, and some of them received first-grade 
* certificates. ‘ 
We have a Teachers’ Circulating Library, containing eight 
hundred volumes, and every white teacher is a member. 
Once a year we have a County School Rally, and call to- 
gether the teachers, pupils, patrons, and citizens. An interest- 
ing programme for the day is furnished by the various schools 
of the county. The,work done by the pupils the past year in 
schoo] is placed on exhibition. At the close of the day awards 
are given by competent judges to schools showing the best dis- 
play. We have tried this School Rally Day for three years

past, and have derived therefrom the most satisfactory results. 
I make an effort to attend just as many of the school closings 
as possible, and encourage pupils to remain in school till the 
Eighth Grade at least is completed, and their diplomas won and 
received. J prepare the questions and make the examination 
uniform for all completing the Fifth and Eighth Grades of the 
Public School Course. On such occasions I strive to encourage 
the schools with appropriate exercises, so that pupils, teachers, 
and patrons may be brought together and the general educa- 
tional interest be thus augmented. 
GILES COUNTY. 
  
J.T. Crossno, Superintendent. 
  
The public schools of Giles County have been more prosperous 
this term than heretofore. The instructions of the State Super- 
intendent for the examining and licensing of teachers have been 
followed, and, as a result, the standard of teachers has been 
greatly improved and the class of work performed much more 
satisfactory. : 
We had an Institute for the teachers of Giles County, at Pu-— 
Jaski, which continued one week. The County Superintendent 
was aided in conducting this Institute by Professor McMurran, 
of Franklin, Tenn. A large percentage of the teachers attended 
the Institute regularly, and the work done was very gratifying. 
GRAINGER COUNTY. 
  
W. 7. Phillips, Superintendent. 
  
The Grainger County Teachers’ Institute was in session from 
July 10 to July 15,1899. J. D. Wheat was elected Chairman ; 
R. C. Camper, Assistant Chairman; and G. W. Shultz, Seecre-

  a 
tary. Some of those who assisted in the Institute by able lec- 
tures were: W. A. Evans, Miss Angie Goldman, Ex-Superintend- 
ent Justus, J. E. Wickham. On July 13 Prof. T. H. Holder 
and Miss L. J. Bradley, who were attending the Institute, were 
married. The Committee on Resolutions, composed of Misses 
Kate Jarnagin and Myra Jarnagin, reported, among others, 
resolutions on the death of Prof. D. W. Griffith, and one asking 
the State. Superintendent to give State aid to the Institute in 
1900. here were seventy-three teachers present. After the 
close of the Institute, Professor Evans, of Virginia, said: “I 
have been in Institutes in three States, but this is the best I have 
ever seen.” : 
The log schoolhouse has had its day in Grainger County. 
Now all are modern houses. A great many are furnished with 
up-to-date desks, seats attached. I am having a great many of 
the newer houses insured. We have lost two houses in the last 
few years by fire, and I think, for the small fee charged by the — 
insurance companies, that insurance is a good thing, scarcely 
taking anything from the schools. _ 
GREENE COUNTY. 
John H. Love, Superintendent. 
There was no County Institute held in Greene County this 
year (1899). A State Institute was held for four weeks, be- 
ginning on July’3. On July 31 and August 1 there was held 
an examination at Greeneville for the benefit of those who > 
failed to attend the State Institute. The examination was con- 
ducted by Profs. J. K. P. Sayler, J. W. Lucas, W. T. Guthrie, 
and G. W. White. % 
An Institute and examination for colored teachers was held 
at Greeneville on July 14 and 15. The examination was con- 
ducted by Prof. G. W. White, Superintendent, Love, Prof. W.

GRUNDY COUNTY. 
G. C. Partin, Superintendent. 
The public schools of Grundy County are prospering, not- 
withstanding the limited amount of funds in a great many of® 
the rural districts, which necessarily makes the school terms 
very short. , 
After my election the first step I took toward progress was to 
get a corps of thoroughly qualified teachers. In order to do 
this, I required all teachers in the county to undergo a written 
examination, which resulted in the elimination of a large num- 
ber of unqualified teachers who had been teaching for a number 
of years. 
have held two Summer Institutes since I have been Superin-’ 
tendent. They have been of incaleulable value to our teachers. 
T have visited almost every school in the county this year, and 
have talked to them concerning the various things that I thought 
they most needed. The attendance is not what it should be, but 
the per cent of attendance is rapidly increasing. 
HAMBLEN COUNTY. 
  
Miss Ida Johnson, Superintendent. 
The Hamblen County Teachers’ Institute was held in Morris- 
town, beginning on July 10 and closing on July 15, 1899. 
Prof. Charles Mason, Superintendent of the Morristown City 
Schools, was Instructor. His part of the work was ably at- 
tended to, showing him to be a thorough educator and well ac- 
quainted with the needs of the public schools. The first four ~ 
days of the Institute were spent in the discussion of the various 
topics of interest to teachers. The Institute was visited by sev- 
eral prominent educators, who lectured and entered into the dis-
-P-A-G-E-148
— 189 — 
cussions. Dr. George F. Mellen, of the University of Tennes- - 
see, as present on Tuesday and gave a lecture on History. On 
Tuesday evening an entertainment was given at the Baptist 
Church by the Institute. Mr. J. M. McFarland gave a short 
address on the subject, “Should the State Furnish Text-books 
for the Public Schools?” The subject was ably treated and 
considerable interest was aroused. Dr. R. N. Price lectured on 
“The Making of a Man.” This was delivered in his usual in- 
teresting manner and was much enjoyed. Misses Annie Black, 
Sallie Everett, and Nola Brown gave very entertaining recita- 
tions, and excellent music was furnished by Misses Georgie 
Jarnagin and Bessie McCrary. During the Institute, Pro- 
fessor and Mrs. Jones, of the Morristown Kindergarten, gave 
some instruction in Primary work. Mrs. C. O. Baker gave a 
practical lecture on Physiology and Hygiene; and Mr. Allen, 
the “ Chalk Taiker,” gave a short exercise. Prof. J. T. Hen- 
derson, President of Carson and Newman College, Mossy Creek, 
visited the Institute and made a very practical address. The 
thanks of the Institute are due Miss Stella Loop, Messrs. W. D. 
Creech, E. E. Anderson, A. A. Anderson, and Robert Anderson 
for the excellent music furnished by them. 
-The annual meeting of School Directors was called for 
Wednesday afternoon. Great interest was manifested on the 
part of the directors, and plans for improving the county schools 
were discussed. 
  HAMILTON COUNTY. 
Samuel Hixson, Superintendent. 
  
The Normal Institute for Hamilton County was held in the 
Chattanooga Normal University building, beginning on May 
29, 1899, and continuing in session for three weeks. This was 
the most successful and best-attended Institute ever held in 
Hamilton County, there being about 95 per cent. of the teaching 
force in attendance.
-P-A-G-E-149
  = 140, 
Instructors of ability and experience were employed, which 
is a very essential factor in a successful Institute. Prof. 
Wycliffe Rose, of Nashville; Miss Laura Cravens, of Lexing- 
ton, Ky.; and Miss Mercer Wright, of Hicksville, O., consti- 
tuted the Faculty. 
The work done was of a high order. The function of the 
Institute was thought not to be to prepare teachers for examina- 
tion, but rather to train them along professional lines. Lec- 
tures were accordingly delivered and lessons assigned on ap- 
plied Psychology, Pedagogy, School Management, ete. This 
theoretical work on the science of education was very beauti- 
fully supplemented by the daily sessions of the Model School, 
taught by Miss Cravens. The children which composed this 
school were taught Numbers, Language, Nature Drawing, Clay 
Modeling, Sand Molding, Rote Songs, Physical Culture, Litera- 
ture, and History according to the most approved methods. 
Vocal music received considerable attention, daily lessons 
being given by Miss Mercer Wright. 
An important feature of the Institute was the Teachers’ Read- 
ing Cirele work. Instruction was given each day on the Read- 
ing Courses which were outlined at the beginning of the school 
year. All regular teachers who took this work and complied 
with the conditions prescribed by the County Superintendent 
received certificates to teach without an examination. This 
arrangement caused considerable interest, in consequence of 
which much has been accomplished toward securing a better 
qualification of the rural teachers.

had been well advertised by the distribution of printed folders, 
and was the best attended as well as the most interesting Insti-

ance was sixty-five. : . 
Interest in educational affairs, Institutes, and teachers’ meet- 
ings is on the increase. 
HARDEMAN COUNTY. 
  
J. A, Hudson, Superintendent. 
  
The Hardeman County Teachers’ Institute was held at Boli- 
var from June 26 to July 5, 1899. Tt was conducted by Super- 
intendent Hudson, who was assisted by the following: D. E. 
Bishop, I. N. Roland, W. L. Robinson, G. W. Christian, J. L. 
Allford, Miss Lizzie Hundley, W. R. Lewellyn, Miss Ella Fer- 
guson, and P. M. Bishop. Special addresses were made by Rev. 
W. A. Jordan, Rev. D. M. McIver, Elder A. G. Freed, and Rev. © 
C.S. Ware. The Institute was attended by about ninety active 
teachers, and was pronounced the best that this county has ever 
had, both in attendance and character of the work done. 
The colored Institute was attended by sixty-five teachers and 
was successfully conducted. : 
School interest is good. We expect to have a directors’ meet- 
ing at an early date, and thereby arouse more interest, and co- 
operation. :

able work was done for the cause of public education. There 
were sixty teachers in attendance, and they took an active 
interest in the work. Superintendent C. B. Ijams, of Ches- 
ter County, and Superintendent Horry Hodges, of McNairy 
County, were present during the last week of the Institute and 
rendered valuable assistance. President G. M. Savage, of the 
Southwestern Baptist University, Jackson, was present and 
made an able address on education. 
HAWKINS COUNTY. 
W. A. Shejffey, Superintendent. 
There were three Institutes held in this county during the 
present year—two for white teachers and one for colored teach- 
ers. 
The first Institute convened at Alum Well on July 17} and 
was conducted by Prof. J. W. Yankee. It was attended by a 
‘majority of teachers residing north of the river. A number of 
interesting addresses were delivered by Prof. W. M. Graybill, 
Prof. H. B. Wallace, and others. The State Superintendent 
" spent part of two days at this meeting, delivering two instructive 
addresses. In the first of these he created something like con- 
sternation by stating that all teachers, irrespective of age or 
time of service, must be examined. Hitherto some of our older 
and more experienced teachers have been accustomed to rely on 
their experience, number of certificates held, ete., to secure 
duplicate certificates without examination. When they heard 
the State Superintertdent’s statement as to examination, they 
became somewhat exercised over the matter, but finally yielded 
to the inevitable. 
The second Institute convened at Persia on July 25, lasting 
one week. It was under the immediate direction of the County 
Superintendent. The programme was similar to that of the —
-P-A-G-E-152
48 
former Institute. A majority of the teachers south of the river 
attended this meeting and appeared to be materially benefited 
by the instruction given, new methods discussed, and object les- 
sons presented. The idea sought to be inculcated was not so 
much what to teach as how to teach, it being a fair presumption 
that the youthful applicant for a certificate was probably better 
acquainted with the subject-matter required to be taught than 
with the most effective methods of teaching the same. Exami- 
nations were held at the close of the week’s work. 
The Colored Teachers’ Institute convened at Rogersville, 
and was conducted by Rev. W. N. Franklin. The attendance 
was reasonably good. About 50 per cent passed the examina- 
tion. 
HAYWOOD COUNTY. 
J. A. Powell, Superintendent. 
In Haywood County a Teachers’ Institute is held on the first 
Saturday in each month for white teachers, and on the second 
Saturday for colored teachers. The plan pursued is this: Four 
of the branches in the public school course are taken up at each 
meeting, the branches having been selected at the previous meet- 
ing. A leader for each branch is selected. He leads the dis- 
cussion, which is participated in by the other teachers present. 
Our annual Institute was held at Brownsville from June 26 to 
July 3, 1899, and was conducted by the County Superintendent, 
~ assisted by the teachers of the county. About forty teachers at- 
tended, together with a large number of visitors. Our Institute 
for colored teachers was well attended.

HENRY COUNTY. 
Mrs. Annette Watters, Superintendent. 
  
Our County Institute convened at Paris on June 26, 1899, 
and continued six days. The last two days—June 30 and 
July 1—were devoted to examination for teachers’ certificates. 
President J. A. Baber, of the Southern Normal University, 
Huntingdon, Tenn., was our efficient Conductor. Mr. Baber 
is an intensely practical and thorough teacher and an able In- 
structor in Institute work, and our teachers went away feeling 
that they had gained something that would be of practical bene- 
fit to them in their school work, not simply an array of words, 
words, words. Valuable service was also rendered by Professor 
Thomas, the new principal of the Paris High School. Mr. 
Thomas is a graduate of the Ohio State Normal, and also a stu-  
-P-A-G-E-154

dent of Chicago University, and his talk on English was espe- 
cially fine. He urged the teachers to give more time to English 
and Reading, as no one can be truly a scholar who has not mas- 
tered his mother tongue and given much time and attention to 
Rhetoric. Professor Hunter, also of the Paris School, pre- 
sented the subjects of Algebra and Geometry in a light new to 
many of the teachers, which was much appreciated. But best 
of all was a lecture on Tuesday night by Dr. Alfred Holbrook, 
of national repute, the founder and for forty years President 
and Chancellor of the Lebanon (Ohio) Normal. On Wednes- 
day morning Dr. Holbrook made a fine talk on English Gram- 
mar. We all felt much honored in having with us this grand 
old pioneer of education—a kingly man, who has in a manner 
sacrificed himself to the cause that he loves, the cause that is 
nearest. his heart: the educating, the uplifting, the purifying of 
the thoughts, the desires, and the intellect of the human race. 
Well may the Henry County Institute count it a red-letter day 
that brought with it Dr. Alfred Holbrook.- Our Institute was 
well attended. Ninety-five teachers were present, and the ma- 
jority of them manifested much interest in the work. Many 
expressed themselves as much profited. while others declared it 
the best they had ever attended in the county.. I suppose there 
were about twenty-five who failed to attend, some giving valid 
excuses, while others seemed to have been utterly indifferent. 
On the last evening of the Institute a Reading Circle was or- 
ganized and the sixty-three districts grouped into ten sections, 
each section to have a Teachers’ Association and Reading Circle 
every month, and three times a year all will meet in joint session 
at the county seat to repert work and to participate in such exer- 
cises as may from time to time be set forth by the Committee on 
Programme. We expect from this a most pleasant and profit- 
able year’s work, and hope to raise the standard of teachers and 
teachers’ work in our county.

The Hickman County Teachers’ Institute met at Centerville 
on July 3, 1899, and continued for six days. It was conducted ~ 
by Prof. R. W. Jones, of the Nashville City Schools. Of the 
Institute, Professor Jones says: “ It has never been my good 
fortune to attend a more harmonious, enthusiastic, and enjoy- 
able meeting of teachers.”’ The Institute had been well adver- 
tised by printed folders, containing the programme, circulated 
by the County Superintendent.. The programme was carried 
out in a very acceptable manner. There was a large attendance 
of teachers and visitors every day. 
On Monday night Rev. G. O. Bachman, of Nashville, gave 
an interesting and instructive talk on “The Teacher and the 
Teacher’s Work.” On the following Thursday afternoon Hon. 
L. P. Padgett, of Columbia, addressed the Institute.

The Houston County Teachers’ Institute was in session at 
Erin from July 3 to July 8, 1899; Prof. J. H. Bayer, of Cum- 
berland City, Conductor. Ninety-six per cent of the teachers 
of the County were present. It was the most interesting and 
profitable Institute ever held in the county. The work was con- 
fined to the Primary Course and to a study of school law and 
school government. Principles and methods were discussed 
and some class work done. The teachers were attentive, active, 
and regular in their attendance. A number of teachers from 
other counties were present. The per cent of daily attendance 
was 96. Resolutions indorsing the text-book law and the adop- 
tions made by the Text-book Commission were unanimously 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
ete 
adopted. The teachers of the county pledged themselves to the 
support of the law. While excellent work was done in the In- 
stitute this year, it is hoped that next year a longer term will be 
had and better results obtained. 
HUMPHREYS COUNTY. 
  
P. L. Bradley. Superintendent. 
  
The Humphreys County Teachers’ Institute opened at Mc 
Ewen on June 5, 1899, and closed with a teachers’ examination 
on June 29 and 30. The Institute was conducted by W. H. 
Coleman, President of MeEwen Normal College, and Superin- 
tendent P. L. Bradley. M. J. Bennan was made Secretary. 
_» There were twenty male teachers and twenty female teachers 
enrolled. A practical, comprehensive review was given in all 
the subjects required to be taught in public schools. Special 
attention was given to the Primary branches, as there are but 
few Secondary schools in this county. All the teachers 
who‘attended expressed themselves as being highly benefited, 
and so pleasantly was the time passed that many were heard 
to say that they would be content to spend their lives in a Sum- 
mer Institute. The Institute was pronounced by all to have 
been the best ever held in this county. 
There were ten teachers from this county in attendance at the 
State Institute held at Dickson. 
There has been some prejudice against Summer Institutes 
in this county, on account of the teachers who could not attend 
thinking that those who did attend were favored in the examina- 
tion; but we are glad to say that sentiment is dying away and 
interest in Institutes is constantly increasing. It has been the 
custom to hold a Summer Institute in this county each year for 
the last five years, and the superiority of the corps of teachers 
we have to-day over that of five years ago is very remarkable. 
The quality of instruction in our schools is much better, ‘and in 
_ general educational interest has increased very much.

JACKSON COUNTY. 
U. T. Spurlock, Superintendent. 
The annual Association of the Teachers of Jackson County 
+ met at Flynn’s Lick on June 19, 1899, and continued in session 
one week. I procured the services of M. L. Moore, of Gamaliel, 
Ky., and D. E. Morris, of Willette, Tenn., as Conductors of the 
Institute. I examined the teachers on two branches of ‘study 
each day, after which the entire time was devoted to the discus- 
sion of the various branches and to the best methods of teaching. 
Sixty-seven teachers were present. I insisted that directors 
should not agree to employ teachers until the Institute is over 
and the teachers have all passed; but they continue to promise 
schools beforehand, and thereby injure the attendance. I am» 
doing all that I can to educate school officers in regard to this 
matter. Our Instructors in the Institute were wide awake, and ~ 
good interest was manifested every day. Conductor Moore 
gave us two lectures at night during the week. ‘The citizens 
were much interested during the entire week, and every one 
spoke in praise of the good work done and of the activity of the 
teachers. 
We have many good teachers in this county, twenty-one of 
whom are holding Secondary certificates—nine are holding 
First Grades, and twelve holding Second Grades. I am en- 
deavoring to grant certificates only to such teachers as are 
thoroughly qualified to teach, and the improvement is already 
marked. The time has passed when any novice can obtain a 
position as teacher in this county. ¢ 
Ihave many things of which to complain. The want of funds 
necessarily cuts our schools short. Many directors aspire to 
office in order that they may assist their relatives. We need 
legislation on this point. In several instances I have made out 
the district clerk’s report for him, knowing that he was not able 
to do so. A majority of the directors are not able to read in- — 
telligently or write legibly. 
   
-P-A-G-E-158

The teachers are trying to improve the schools, and every 
year we see an improvement over the previous year. We have 
monthly meetings of the teachers, and they are well attended, 
both by teachers and citizens. On the whole, I am glad to say 
that while our schools and school officers are not what they 
should be, yet they are doing great good and at the same time 
grow better every year. 
JAMES COUNTY. 
  
J. G. Lane, Superintendent. 
  
The James County Teachers’ Institute-met on July 2, 1899, 
at Oolteweh, and continued six days under the instruction of 
Professor Livingston, of Somerset, Ky. There were thirty-two 
teachers in regular attendance, all the teachers in the county 
being present, except two. Two examinations were held—one 
in the regular Course of Study, and another in our Reading Cir- 
cle Course, which consisted of Halleck’s Psychology and Par- 
ker’s Talks to Teachers. 
The teachers seemed more earnest and enthusiastic this year 
than ever before, and they were decidedly better up on all lines 
of school werk, and consequently made better grades. They all 
left the Institute more hopeful for the year’s work. The teach- 
ers have begun to study teaching as a profession. 
One special and encouraging feature of our Institute was that 
‘a number of the School Directors of the county were present 
and manifested a greater interest than ever before in the work, 
and so we expect a great awakening this year in all the depart- 
ments of our school work. 
There are twenty-seven schools in the county—twenty-four 
Primary and three Secondary schools. They all have a good 
attendance, with more than usual interest manifested by direct- 
ors and parents; and, upon the whole, I think these manifesta- 
tions of interest are due to the very efficient work done in the 
Institute.

Our Normal was held in the chapel of Maury Academy, in 
Dandridge, beginning on July 10, 1899, and continuing one 
week. The Institute was. conducted by the Superintendent, 
assisted by Prof. A. R. Hickam and the county teachers. Three 
days were taken up in lectures and discussions, and two days 
were devoted to examinations. Nearly every teacher in the 
county was present, and those not present were kept away be 
eause of valid reasons. Our enrollment reached one hundred 
and seven, which was the largest enrollment of teachers we have 
ever had in the county. An unusual amount of interest was 
taken in every exercise. 
Our teachers are rapidly improving along all lines. They 
are subscribing for school journals, studying up-to-date meth- ; 
ods, and the advancement in many ways is quite perceptible. 
The colored teachers are doing excellent work. More than 
50 per cent of the colored teachers of Jefferson County are either 
graduates of some good college or have attended the same. 
The teachers of the county are also interested in teachers’ 
meetings and attend regularly. Upon the whole, we are glad 
to report the public schools of Jefferson County in a most pro- 
gressive condition. ‘

a very live man in Institute work and lets nothing drag. 
I note in my visits that teachers have been benefited by the 
Institute, and are trying to profit by what they have learned. 
The school work is progressing fairly satisfactory. Teachers 
are interested, pupils seem. to have a spirit of progress, and all 
are trying to work in harmony.’ 
KNOX COUNTY. 
D. P. Duggan, Superintendent. 
  
By comparing the inclosed statistical report with the former 
reports of this office, you will see that Knox County is endeavor- 
ing to keep pace with the educational advancement of the day, — 
and that our schools were never in a better condition. 
The scholastic population has increased 3,456 since my report 
for last year. The attendance is much better, and the interest 
has been largely increased by teachers and parents as well as by 
the pupils. 
The Knox County Normal commenced on June 26, 1899, at 
the Baker and IHimel School building, in Knoxville, and con- 
tinued two weeks. I was assisted in the work by Profs. W. S. 
Bryan, principal of the Hampden-Sidney School; Luther B. 
D’ Armond, now professor in the Business Department of Carson 
and Newman College, Mossy Creek; and Cooper D. Schmitt, 
professor of Mathematics in the University of Tennessee. T'wo 
hundred and fifty teachers were in daily attendance, with an en- 
rollment of teachers and visitors approximating three hundred 
and fifty. Such an attendance has never before been known in 
the history of Normals in the State in the way a County Nor- 
mal. The Institute was divided into Primaf: and Secondary 
Departments from the fact that we could not find one room large 
enough to accommodate the teachers present. Prof. W. 8. Bryan 
taught Reading, Arithmetic, Physiology, State History, United
-P-A-G-E-163
= 15 2e— 
States History, School.Law, Theory and Practice; Professor 
Schmitt taught Algebra, Geometry, and Philosophy; Prof. Lu- 
ther B. D’Armond taught Bookkeeping, Penmanship, and Civil 
Government; Misses Lillian Rule and Lizzie Turner gave some 
most excellent lectures on Geography, which were considered of 
much value to the county teachers who are interested in the 
teaching of Geography; County Superintendent D. P. Duggan 
had Spelling, Mental Arithmetic, and Grammar. The teachers 
of the county took an active part in all the work, and showed 
much interest in the Institute. We wish to say for our men 
who conducted the Normal that more practical and up-to-date 
Tnstructors cannot be found in the State. 
The Normal Institute was favored with most excellent talks 
from such prominent educators as J. H. McCallie, Superin- 
tendent City Schools; Prof. J. R. Lowery, principal of North 
Knoxville Schools; Maj. E. E. McOroskey, president Educa- 
-tional Board City Schools; and J. C. Blassingame, president 
Holbrook Normal College. 
The success of the Normal was greatly increased by the wntir- 
ing efforts of our faithful secretary, Prof. J. W. Shelley, prin- 
cipal of Porter Academy.

LAUDERDALE COUNTY. 
H. T. Hanks, Superintendent. 
I have had much trouble in the securing of statistical reports 
from directors. They seem to think that they have done their 
whole duty when they have reported the scholastic population 
and employed teachers. I have tried twice during this year to 
hold directors’ meetings in order to get them interested in their 
work and to explain to them the duties with which they do not 
seem to be familiar. These meetings have been poorly attended. 
“T have piped unto them, and they have not danced; I have 
mourned unto them, and they have not lamented.” Another 
obstacle in the way of suecess of the public schools lies in the 
abuse of the power vested in the County Court to create an in- 
definite number of school districts. It has been attended with 
much evil and little good here. ' 
On June 5, 1899, I began and held an Institute for colored 
teachers, which, with the examinations, lasted five days. Fifty- 
one teachers were in attendance, and there was searcely an hour’s 
absence among them all, from beginning to end. Not only was 
the attendance full and constant, but the interest manifested was 
generally lively, and in some cases enthusiastic. The exercises 
were productive of much good. There has been a manifest im- 
provement in the edneational status of the colored teachers of 
this county in the past two years. I have succeeded in forming 
among them a County Teachers’ Association, which has held 
monthly meetings since March last. They are also forming 
local societies in different parts of the county for mutual im- 
provement. 
On June 12, 1899, I opened an Institute for the white teach- 
ers of this county, which was under the direction of Prof. G. R. 
Throop, assisted in some degree by myself. Professor Throop 
is the principal of the city school here, and a most excellent In- 
stitute Conductor. Fifty teachers were in constant attendance, 
and but few were marked absent or tardy at: roll call at any ses-
-P-A-G-E-165
— 154— 
sion. The interest continued to increase till the close. More 
interest was manifested among the citizens than at any former 
meeting of the Institute. The time was devoted principally to 
the discussion of, and drill in, the branches required to be taught 
in the Primary Schools, and this was as thorough as the time 
would admit of. The teachers all responded promptly to any 
calls made on them, and took an active part in the exercises gen- 
erally. 
At the close of the Institute, I made a proposition to form a 
Teachers’ Association and Library, to which a large number 
promptly responded, and this will be done in the near future. 
The personnel of the teachers of this county will compare 
favorably with others. They are mainly an intelligent body of. 
Christian men and women, who seem imbued with a desire to 
make the best of themselves and their pupils. 
LAWRENCE COUNTY. 
Robert L. Sutton, Superintendent. 
Our Institute for 1899 began on the first Monday in July and 
~ continued two weeks, with the County Superintendent as Con- 
ductor, and Profs. S. A. Link, of Nashville; G. W. Kelley, of 
West Point, Tenn.; and Z. W. Strickland, Instructors. The 
Institute had been advertised by private correspondence, the use 
of the Union and the Democrat (two papers at Lawrenceburg), 
and a special four-page announcement. 
The first day’s enrollment was fifty-four, and the third day’s 
enrollment was seventy-four; and after the third day but two 
more were enrolled. Thus you see the teachers came at the be- 
ginning of the Institute, and net at the last, as is usually the 
case. The enrollment on the first day would have been greater,   
-P-A-G-E-166
— 155 — 
but the second day of the Institute was the Fourth of July, so 
that many stayed at home till after that day on account of the 
celebrations throughout the county ; for you must know that Law- 
rence is a very patriotic county, and honors the Fourth as our 
national birthday. Some of the teachers wanted to adjourn for 
the Fourth, but others thought we, as teachers, should celebrate; 
so the Superintendent and Instructors all announced they would 
stay with those who desired to stay, and a committee of that 
number was appointed to prepare a programme for next morn- 
ing. The committee faithfully and ereditably did its work, and 
received the hearty approval of all those who were present. The 
teachers had very pleasant exercises, and adjourned at noon till 
1 o’clock P.M., when they resumed Institute work. All ex- 
pressed themselves as having enjoyed the morning very much 
better, they thought, than they could have done elsewhere. 
The Lawrence County Teachers’ Institute was organized un- 
der a system of Constitution and By-laws in 1898, and one clause 
in these articles provided that each teacher should pay upon 
entrance, annually, one dollar as Institute Fee. This was met 
promptly, and by the third day over seventy dollars were in the 
treasury, for defraying the expenses of the Institute, and by the 
close about seventy-six dollars were in the Treasurer’s hands. 
So the Institute was conducted upon business principles. 
Under the Superintendent’s plans, the Institute opened on the 
first Monday in July, at 10 o’clock A.M., and the examination 
at 1 o’clock P.M. on the first Friday. After this the Institute 
work was in the forenoon, and examination in the afternoon; 
so that but half a day each day for a week was devoted to ex- 
amination, and but two to three subjects an evening. In this 
way the teachers were not exhausted, but held up through the 
examination. Another good feature was, it brought the teachers 
into the Institute early and held them late—that is, those teach- 
ers who would not attend the Institute upon their own love for 
and interest in the work. 
Another feature of the work was, the Superintendent prepared 
the full set of questions and had one hundred and fifty copies 
printed ; so that each teacher had a list of questions for himself,
-P-A-G-E-167
‘— 166 — 
and was not wearied by straining his eyes reading the questions 
from the board. All the teachers highly approved of this; and 
this, in my opinion, was one of the most commendable features 
of the examination. 
Here I attach a set of our rules, which were carried out to the 
letter ; also the set of questions on Theory and Practice of Teach- 
ing: 
RULES FOR THE EXAMINATION. 
1. None but those who have secured schools in Lawrence 
County, or contemplate teaching in the county the ensuing year, 
will be admitted to the examination. 
2. But one teacher will be allowed to a desk. 
3. No visitors allowed at the desks. 
4. All teachers must be at their desks at the beginning of the 
examination on any subject, and will not be allowed to leave their 
desks till the entire Institute is relieved, which will be announced 
o) the Superintendent at the end of each subject. 
. All questions must be returned with the manuscript, other- 
wise the papers will be rejected. 
6. No communication or outside assistance whatever aie be 
used, and a teacher known to accept or give any assistance what- 
ever will be rejected from the examination. 
7. These rules will be followed to the letter. 
THEORY AND PRACTICE. 
1. Write ten lines on how to prevent or cure tardiness. 
2. Write ten lines on how to secure the codperation of the pa- 
trons. 
3. Write ten lines on yard supervision. 
4. Write ten lines on order in the schoolroom. 
5. Write ten lines on how to conduct a recitation. 
6. Write ten lines on the teacher’s influence on the character 
of the pupil. 
7. Write ten lines on beautifying the school premises, and the 
influence upon the teachers and pupils. 
8. Write ten lines on the aims of school life of a pupil from 
the teacher’s standpoint. _
-P-A-G-E-168
— 157 — 
9. Write ten lines on the difference between “ school-teach- 
ing” and “ school keeping.” 
10. Write ten lines on the teacher’s relation to the community. 
One other regulation the Superintendent introduced that was 
also appreciated was the mark of merit for attendance. All 
teachers who enrolled the first day and continued regularly in 
attendance would receive 24 per cent on general average, and 
all who enrolled on the third day on the same conditions would 
receive 2 per cent, but those who enrolled after that would get 
no marks of merit. Thus we had a prompt and regular attend- 
ance. 
We were very much pleased-with the interest and enthusiasm 
manifested by the teachers, and the evidences of approval of our 
manner of conducting the Institute and the examination. 
One requirement made by our Superintendent was that all 
teachers with whom he was not acquainted must furnish testi- 
monials from good citizens of their good moral character; also 
that any teacher passing on moral character and receiving a 
certificate was required to maintain such certificate, and should 
any teacher fail to do so, his certificate would be forfeited and 
canceled. We hold that immoral teachers are unsafe custo- 
dians of our children’s interests and characters, and should not 
be allowed the responsibility of training them. 
About 80 per cent of the applicants passed, and enough poner 
the subsequent examinations to furnish all our schools except 
about eight or ten. We had only four to apply for Secondary 
examination, and all passed. 
We desire to state that all examinations and certificates have 
been in accordance with the State Superintendent’s instructions. 
We desire to thank our State Superintendent for sending so 
able an assistant to cur Institute as Prof. 8. A. Link. We can- 
not express our appreciation for what he did for us, but we can 
say that Professor Link has a lasting abode in our hearts for the 
interest he took in us and the many valuable lessons he taught us. 
These are the expressions of our teachers as well as of the Se 
Superintendent. 
Mr. V. Z. Strickland, of the Rasa Temperance Uni-
-P-A-G-E-169
— 158 — 
versity, Harriman, Tenn., and Mr. Leo W. Kelley, of West 
Point, Tenn., were the Instructors employed by the Executive 
Committee of the Institute; and it was the great satisfaction of 
the committee that the Institute was so well pleased with the 
selection. No better Board of Instructors could be selected 
~ than was this board—that is, the two selected by the committee, 
together with the one selected by the State Superintendent. 
Our schools are moving along very well, and I think the new 
book law will meet with the approval of the people when once 
in operation. - 
We have finished and furnished one new school building this 
year, worth about $800. We have two others under construc- 
tion—one in condition for use, and will be finished before cold 
weather, worth about $500; the other will be finished and fur- 
nished by October 1, and will be worth about $800. We are con- 
templating a fourth building to be constructed this fall, which 
will be about the same in value as this last. All these buildings 
_are upon land deeded properly to the School Directors. In fact, 
I will not countersign a warrant for building, repairing a build- 
ing, or furnishing one that does not belong to the public schools. 
We will build more in a few weeks, I think. Our schools will 
continue from five to seven months this year. We are greatly 
encouraged, and think it but a short time till Lawrence County 
will show up equal to the best. ‘ 
LEWIS COUNTY. 
  
J.T. Banks, Superintendent. 
  
The Lewis County Teachers’ Institute was in session at Ho- 
henwald from July 10 to July 17, 1899. Mrs. S. A. Green, of 
the Nashville City Schools, was appointed hy the State Superin- 
tendent to give instruction in this Institute. Superintendent 
Banks and Professor Smethurst, of Hohenwald, were also In- 
structors.

e159 — 
This was the best Institute ever held in Lewis County, and all 
think that the good will be lasting. 
There are in the county only about thirty teachers, all of whom 
attended the Institute, and nearly all participated in the diseus- 
sions, thus adding to the interest and showing a spirit and a 
force never before shown here. Many desired to continue the 
Institute another week, but this was not practical for some, so 
the idea was abandoned, with the agreement that the Institute 
of 1900 shall last at least two weeks. 
Mrs. Green set before the teachers the necessity of preparing 
themselves for their profession, their gain by contact with each 
other and the exchange of ideas, also the need of a pedagogical 
library. As a result, a monthly Association, and in connection 
with it a Reading Circle, was decided upon by the teachers, and 
these will doubtless be productive of much good. 
The county is small, but the field is large, for the standard of 
education in Lewis County is far below what it should be; but 
the work has received an added strength for the coming year. 
The members of the Institute returned thanks to Mrs. Green 
for her beneficial and entertaining work, and also to the State 
Superintendent for having sent assistance. Aid could not have 
been given where it was more needed, nor have been more deeply 
appreciated than by the teachers of Lewis County. 
LINCOLN COUNTY. 
  
T. M. Wilson, Superintendent. 
  
We opened our annual Institute for Lincoln County at Fay- 
etteville on Monday, June 26, 1899, and continued our work 
two weeks, closing on Saturday, July 8. We enrolled of the 
white teachers, 159; and of the colored, 48. We were assisted 
by none but home talent. There soon developed an unusual in- 
terest in the work, and now it is the general opinion of all teach- 
ers and friends visiting that it was the best two-weeks’ work the 
teachers of our county have ever had. We discussed not only
-P-A-G-E-171
160 — 
the methods of teaching the various branches of the free school 
curriculum, but very close attention was given to the subject- 
matter of these subjects. Professors Johnson and Simmons, of 
Fayetteville, and Miller, of Petersburg, were with us as assist- 
ants—Johnson and Simmons all the time, and Miller three days. 
Prof. John Smith, now a member of Professor Tate’s Faculty 
in West Tennessee, was also an untiring and useful assistant. 
Several of the more advanced teachers of the county led in class 
work and did excellent service. 
We began the examination of teachers the second week of the 
Institute, and in this examination your instructions were fol-~ 
lowed to the letter. Every teacher was examined who was not 
exempt by law. ‘The examination was practical and aimed 
straight to a clear understanding of the subjects. We used a 
card system in this part of the work in such a way that no mem- 
ber of the Grading Committee could know whose papers he was 
grading. The negroes were given the same examination that 
the whites had, and although a large number of them and quite 
a large percentage of the whites failed to reach the required 
grading, we think the course pursued is the correct one, and that 
it has done more real good for the schools of our county than any 
other course we could have pursued. 
Our first quarterly examination was held at the time desig- 
nated by yourself, and we examined twenty-four teachers. Now 
in the entire work we have licensed one hundred and forty-six 
teachers in the examinations, and five are exempt by law. 
‘Lam very busy at this time visiting the schools in the county. 
- In my visits to the schools I am encouraging the teachers and 
their pupils in the best lines of work I can suggest. J am ask- 
ing each teacher to keep a Roll of Honor for his school, and the 
pupils to do all they can to get their names on that roll. Each 
teacher is to report to me at the close of his school, and I am to 
keep a record of these reports in a “ Roll of Honor Book” for 
the county. 
While I see a great deal yet to be done in improving the work 
of our teachers, in arousing a warm and hearty school sentiment 
among the School Directors and the public in general, yet I feel 
proud of the work thus begun. 3

LOUDON COUNTY. 
  
John T. Henderson, Superintendent. 
  
The schools of our county are in a prosperous condition. We 
do not have enough money to run over four or five months this 
year. Next year the term will be about one-fourth longer, as 
the County Court increased the levy for school purposes this 
year. 
About one-third of our teachers are greatly interested in the 
work of teaching, and read educational books and journals, and 
do excellent work. Part of the others are fairly well informed, 
and do ordinary work. A very few teachers have but little in- 
terest in anything, except obtaining their salaries. A few of our 
teachers who are somewhat slow to’ qualify themselves failed to 
obtain certificates this year. 
A Teachers’ Institute of one week’s duration was held at Lou- 
don in July. Nearly all the teachers in the county were present. 
Philadelphia, Morganton, and Lenoir City have had excel- 
lent schools this fall. The only trouble with them is, the money 
gives out too soon; but they are supplemented by subseription, 
and the schools at those places go right on eight or nine months. 
Our teachers have a Teachers’ Association, which meets once 
a month. The best teachers take some interest in these meet- 
ings. 
In the year 1898-99 I visited nearly all the schools in the 
county and made talks to the schools and gave hints and sug- 
gestions to the teachers and directors. 
MACON COUNTY. 
I. N. Donoho, Superintendent. 
  
The Macon County Teachers’ Institute was in session at La- 
fayette from July 3 to July 7, 1899. The Institute, which was 
i
-P-A-G-E-173
— 162 — 
conducted by Prof. H. K. Griffin, was a grand success. The 
attendance was good and much interest and enthusiasm were 
manifested. We feel very grateful to the State Superintendent 
for having sent us so efficient an Instructor as Professor Griffin. 
He is a good man, and knows just what to do in an Institute. 
MWMINN COUNTY. 
  
G. K. Underdown, Superintendent. 
  
The McMinn County Institute for 1899 was held at Athens 
the last week in June. We had the largest attendance that we 
have ever had. Nearly all of the teachers of the county at- 
tended, while a great many teachers from Monroe, Meigs, and 
Bradley Counties also favored us with their presence. The In- 
stitute was a success throughout, being entertaining and in- 
structive. 
The prospect for a good school year was never brighter than 
it is this year. We have some of the most intelligent teachers 
to be found in the State. McMinn County bids fair to rank 
among the first counties of the State in educational affairs.  - 
WNATIRY COUNTY. 
  
Horry Hodges, Superintendent. 
  
Our Teachers’ Institute began at Selmer on June 19, 1899, 
and continued one week. Superintendent Hodges was the Con- ~ 
ductor of the Institute, and the Faculty consisted of Profs. C. 
Hamm and M. R. Abernathy, both ex-County Superintendents 
of this county; Prof. R. M. Houston, principal of the Selmer 
High School; Prof. C. B. Ijams, County Superintendent of
-P-A-G-E-174
—16— 
Chester County; Prof. R. A. Wilkins, president of the M. E. 
College at Henderson; Prof. D. D. Wilson, principal of the 
Bethel High School; Prof. J. D. Mullins, principal of Chewalla 
Institute ; and Misses Laura Blankenship and Amanda Thomas. 
The Faculty was a good one, and excellent work was done in all 
the departments. All the members of the Institute were atten- 
tive and did active and efficient work the entire time. The work 
in the Institute was such as to attract the attention of the busi- 
ness men and all the professional men of the town. Dr. Savage, 
of Jackson, was with us at one session of the Institute, and de- 
livered a very fine lecture. 
We now hold a Saturday Institute at some suitable place in 
the county where a school is in session, with good results. We 
have good interest, good attendance, splendid work, and lively 
discussions on the text-book law and other subjects. We are for 
the uniform text-book law. 
Our Institute was regarded as one of the best ever held in the 
county. We emphasized the importance of attending County 
Institutes, and think we shall be able to have nearly every 
teacher in the county present at our Institute next year. As a 
general rule, the teachers of this county seem very much inter- 
ested in Institute work. 
MADISON COUNTY. 
  
W. M. Wharton, Superintendent. 
I did not conduct a County Institute in this county this year, 
and have not done so for a number of years, because State Insti- 
tutes are annually held at Jackson. The work of the State In- 
stitute being much more satisfactory to the teachers and result- 
ing in greater good to the schools, the teachers of Madison 
County have preferred to attend the State Normal Institute. A 
full report of the proceedings of this Institute will be submitted 
to you by its Conductor. The schools in the districts of Madison
-P-A-G-E-175

County compare favorably with others in West ‘Tennessee, and 
the city schools of Jackson, we think, are equal to any in the 
State. 
MARION COUNTY. 
D. A. Tate, Superintendent. 
  
The public schools of Marion County are in fairly good con- 
dition and are improving. Our greatest hindrance is the short- 
ness of our school terms, due to the lack of funds. We need 
money to enlarge, improve, and furnish the schoolhouses we now 
have, and to build and furnish others. We also need funds to 
buy, inclose, and beautify our school grounds. It seems diffi- 
cult to get some of our people to realize the importance of making 
our schools places of refinement and culture. TI think that a 
majority of our taxpayers are in favor of higher school tax, but 
those having the authority to levy the tax seem to be inclined to 
reduce the tax levy for school purposes, rather than to raise it. 
We believe the State should levy and collect school tax suffi- 
cient to run the schools of the State five months in each year, and 
distribute this money among the various counties according to 
scholastic population. 
We held a two-weeks’ Normal Institute for our teachers dur- 
ing the summer, and almost every teacher in the county attended 
the whole time. I employed Profs. J. A. Setliff and W. E. Ash- 
eraft, of Chattanooga, as Instructors, and they did splendid 
work. 2 
Our teachers are reasonably well prepared for the work, and, 
with few exceptions, are codperating with me in trying to create 
more interest in the cause of education. ; 
When we can get funds sufficient to run our schools long 
enough to accomplish anything substantial by means of a Read- 
ing Circle, we expect to establish one; but for the present we 
think the monthly Teachers’ Meeting, in which we discuss the 
different methods of presenting the various subjects to be taught, 
is best adapted to our needs.

MARSHALL COUNTY. 
J. G. Stinson, Superintendent. 
The following is the report of W. D. Hudgins, Conductor: 
The State and County Institute held in Lewisburg was opened 
on June 19, and closed on June 30. The principals of the 
Haynes-MeLean School kindly tendered us the use of their build- 
ing, in which the sessions of the Institute were held. It being: 
a spacious building, completely equipped for school work, we 
had all the conveniences necessary at our disposal. Besides my- 
self as Conductor, we had a corps-of able Instructors selected 
from the county, some of whose work deserves special mention. 
Prof. W. E. Thompson, of Chapel Hill, did excellent work in 
Arithmetic, Reading, and Geology of Tennessee. Prof. George 
B. Henegar, of the Lewisburg Graded School, deserves to have 
special mention made of his methods of teaching History of 
Tennessee, Mental Arithmetic, and Spelling. Mrs. C. A. Arm-_ 
strong, of Lewisburg, also gave us some splendid work in Gram- 
' mar, Rhetoric, and United States History. Besides the drills 
in Geometry, Physics, Agriculture, and School Management, by 
the Conductor, we had special lectures on the following subjects: 
Civil Government, Messrs. Appleby and Harris; Physiology, 
Prof. A. L. Yearwood; Geography, Miss Margarette Culbert- 
son; Grammar, Mrs. W. D. Hudgins, of the Haynes-McLean 
School; School Law, D. M. Collins and Superintendent J. G. 
Stinson. 
We enrolled fifty teachers the first day, increasing to eighty- 
four the first week, and closed with ninety-four teachers in at- 
tendance. The average daily attendance was over seventy-five. 
Sixty teachers took the Primary examination, and thirteen took 
the Secondary. 
The young people of the town, together with the students of 
the schools, furnished excellent entertainment, consisting of 
music, recitations, ete., which was interspersed with the regular 
work.
-P-A-G-E-177
  —166 — 
There were several prominent educators present, who ren- 
dered valuable aid to our work. Among them, we would men- 
tion Prof. Cooksie, of Texas; Prof. C. S. Ervin, of Moore 
County; Miss Jarrell, of the Peabody Normal College. The 
ministers of the town also rendered valuable help in the way of 
lectures, addresses, talks, ete. : 
Superintendent Stinson did all in his power to make the Insti- 
tute a success. With such a man at the head of the schools of 
Marshall County, it will no doubt soon be the leading educa- 
tional county in the State. 
One day was set apart as Directors’ Day, and a special pro- 
gramme was arranged to that end. Several addresses were 
made on “ The Condition of Our County Schools: How to Im- 
prove Them,” “ The Duties of Directors in Employing Teach- 
~ ers,” ete. The speakers for this occasion were Dr. S. T. Hardi- 
son, Capt. W. G. Loyd, and Hon. W. M. Carter. Other inter- 
esting talks were made by Directors Walker, Ely, and Glenn. 
The Instructors confined themselves principally to methods, 
teaching model classes, and just such points as would most bene- 
fit young teachers. Iam glad to testify to the untiring work of 
the Instructors and the increasing interest of the teachers, as . 
well as the harmony which existed throughout the entire session. 
MAURY COUNTY. 
  
P. W. Dodson, Superintendent. 
  
For the last dozen years the teachers of Maury County have, 
unassisted by the County Court, had a County Institute at Co- 
lumbia, with some of the best Conductors in the State, among 
whom may be mentioned Prof. A. D. Wharton, Capt. W. R. Gar- 
rett, C. L. Hayes, and others, whose work, it is needless to say, 
was of the highest order. The teachers were delighted with the 
Tnstitute work, but it became manifest that the good seed had 
     
-P-A-G-E-178
Sa loi 
often fallen on ground not well prepared for it. As the County 
Court thought that teachers were to be the beneficiaries, though 
not the only nor even the greatest beneficiaries, they decided — 
that the teachers ought to pay for it. Then the teachers con- 
cluded that, as they were to pay the expenses, they would begin 
at the foundation. 
Mrs. C. W. Mitchell, of the Andrews High School, started the 
course with an excellent résumé of psychology—clear, practical, 
and forcible. Our next step was to discuss the educational 
value of the different branches of the publie school course, be- 
ginning with Mathematics, led by J. P. Graham, principal of 
Culleoka Academy ; second, Language, by Miss Ellen Friel, of 
Andrews Iligh School; third, Geography and History, by Prof. 
Shoup, of Columbia Institute; fourth, Science (Physiology and 
Physics), by Capt. R. D. Smith, principal of the Columbia 
Atheneum. 
These subjects were presented and diseussed with great in-_ 
terest and thoroughness. The attendance was already large, 
but from this time the interest and attendance increased so that 
it taxed our large hall to the utmost to hold the teachers. 
At our regular Teachers’ Institute each day the Instructor in 
each subject placed upon the blackboard a syllabus of the topics 
to be discussed the next day. The teachers copied these and 
studied them at night, to be ready to discuss them the next day. 
This they certainly did, and with a will. In this work the aim 
was to get the full value of each subject, as far as treated, as to 
(1) culture, (2) mental discipline, and (3) practical use; in 
other words, (1) to get the teachers to think, and (2) to feel a 
living interest in each topic. 
Mrs. Mitchell, in Geography, had an early period in the day 
and made good use of it. The earth was treated as the abode of 
man, as modified by latitude, altitude, seasons, climate, moun- 
tains, rivers, seas, winds, and currents. Mere names and un- 
important details, hard to remember and sure to be forgotten, 
cnt a small figure; but the flora and fauna, the productions, the 
wants and surplus, the commerce, the chief characteristics of 
the different countries, were compared and contrasted.
-P-A-G-E-179
— 168 — 
Arithmetic was handled by Prof. Jesse Tomlinson, principal 
of McDowell School, in his own peculiar style. So much ques- 
tioning and*probing was indulged in that an ordinary teacher 
felt embarrassed at first, but he was in at the finish. The Insti- 
tute enjoyed this very much. 
Prof. A. C. Allen, of McDowell School, had the subject. of 
History of the United States, but did not devote half his time 
to discovery and exploration and a large portion of the balance 
to “leading generals and dates,” but, like Green in his History 
of the English People, he (1) discussed the causes and effects of 
the leading events in our history, and (2) the lessons to be 
learned therefrom; (3) he disconrsed on the habits and cus- 
toms of our people at different periods, (4) the discoveries and 
inventions made by Americans, and (5) their revolutionizing 
the planting, cultivating, and harvesting of crops, modes of 
travel on land and water, sending news and freight. throughout 
the world. Current.events, the causes and results of the Span- 
ish-American War, were discussed and deep interest was mani- 
fested. The conquests of peace were prized as highly as the con- 
quests of war.   
Tennessee History was handled on the same lines by Prof. J. 
S. Rives, and with like results. 
English Grammar, in charge of Prof. R. L. Harris, late of - 
MecKain’s Training School, awakened the liveliest. interest, and 
for a time it seemed as if he would be overwhelmed by the great 
number of teachers apparently arrayed against him. His ob- 
ject was to arouse interest and secure a critical analysis of some 
grammatical idioms as to participles and infinitives, and this was 
pronounced one of the most profitable exercises of the Institute. 
Geometry was, in the hands of Prof. J. D. Rives, principal of 
Tsom Institute, a very interesting subject. The dust and ecob-> 
webs were first cleared from the definitions and the teachers 
were put to work on a demonstration. It is thought that many 
of them would have been able, after the discussion, to prove two 
triangles equal at any time, day or night, with their eyes shut. 
The origin, history, disciplinary and culture value of Geome- 
try were briefly treated, and reference was made to the vast
-P-A-G-E-180
— 169 — 
multitude of instances in mechanics, engineering, surveying, 
navigation, and astronomy where Geometry is constantly ap- : 
plied. 
Prof. D. T. Harris, of Glendale, gave a unique drill on Alge- 
bra, differing from what many teachers think, attaching more 
importance to factoring than to equations. He showed that he 
thought for himself. 
Capt. R. D. Smith, principal of the Columbia Athenxum, 
gave two excellent lectures. The first was on the importance of 
a higher standard of scholarship; the other, on the wonderful 
advancement made in the use of steam, magnetism, and elec- 
tricity. 
On the subject of Writing and Penmanship, quite an interest 
developed among the teachers. A number of them wrote the 
slanting (Spencerian) hand, both on paper and on the black- 
board, very beautifully; but Miss Ellen Friel’s writing (ver- 
tical), as (1) being more legible, (2) taking less space, (3) more 
rapid of execution, and (4) last, but not least, not near so lia- 
ble to cause astigmatism on account of the right eye being closer 
. to the paper than the left, was more favorably received by the 
teachers. Hence there was great rejoicing that the Text-book 
Commission had adopted the vertical as one of the styles to be 
used. 
But two of the most helpful and inspiring numbers on our 
programme were two addresses—one by Professor Warwick, of 
the Columbia Atheneum, and one by Rev. J. H. Thompson, ~ 
pastor of the Baptist Church in Columbia. Both were on the 
same subject—edueation and the nobility of the teacher’s call- 
ing. Both were earnest and eloquent, taking different phases ~ 
of the theme. They certainly were par ‘nobile fratrum. — _ 
Thus closed what was generally considered the most interest- 
j ing and profitable Institute ever held in the county, and made 
so by the teachers.

MEIGS COUNTY. 
J. G. Paul, Superintendent. 
  
The Meigs County Teachers’ Institute met at Decatur on 
July 10, 1899, and continued one week. It was conducted by 
the County Superintendent. Among the visitors were: Super- 
intendent H. W. Morelock, of Bradley County; Prof. D. A. Bol- 
ton, of Grant University; Prof. Charles Inman, of Sweetwater 
College ; and Profs. Lowry and Stevens, of Dayton. Much hard 
and earnest work was done. 
MONROE COUNTY. 
S.J. Parks, Superintendent. 
  
Our Teachers’ Institute met at Madisonville on the last Mon- 
day in June, 1899; Prof. John W. Hyden, ex-Superintendent 
of Hampden-Sidney City Schools, Knoxville, Conductor. The ~ 
Institute first engaged in an experience meeting, each teacher 
present giving a full description of his past year’s work. Pro- 
fessor Hyden delivered a number of important lectures, among 
which were his discourses on “ School Work” and “ Evil Ef- , 
fects of Narcotics.” Prof. J. S. Cline’s lecture on “ Scientific 
Education ” was scholarly, and was delivered in a forcible man- 
ner. He was followed by Prof. John T. Henderson, of Mossy 
Creek, on the same subject. The Institute enjoved a real lit- 
erary treat from Drs. Hooper and Bachman on “American Citi- 
zenship.” The subject was especially interesting, for the speak- 
ers illustrated it in relation to the training of children for the 
responsibilities of life. Professor Guilliams, of Holbrook Nor 
mal College, deserves special mention for his eloquent address 
on “ Power, Tact, and Skill; ” and we should not fail to men- 
tion Prof. Bachman’s magnificent effort on “ The Spanish War.”

Four days were devoted to the discussion of educational ques- 
- tions and the methods of teaching, by the above-named gentle- 
men, the teachers of the county, and the County Superintendent. 
The examination for Primary certificates was held on the fifth 
day. About seventy-five teachers were in daily attendance. A 
number of visitors were usually present, and at times the large 
auditorium of Bolivar Academy was crowded to its utmost ca- 
pacity. c 
A second Institute was held for the teachers of the south side 
of the county, at the Station Schoolhouse, on July 11, 12, and 13. 
The programme of the Institute at Madisonville was: almost 
duplicated. Monroe County can boast of as intelligent and pro- 
gressive teachers as any county in the State. 
MONTGOMERY COUNTY. 
  
P. L. Harned, Superintendent. 
The ninth annual Institute for white teachers was conducted 
at the Howell School building, Clarksville, during the week 
beginning on July 3, 1899. The Institute was organized by 
the election of the following officers: Chairman, J. G. Rollow; 
Secretary, Miss Maggie Lyle; Conductor, Superintendent P. 
L. Harned. The following teachers were selected as Instructors 
in the different branches: English, W. I. Harper; Mathematics, 
J. G. Rollow; American History, H. L. Faubion; Physiology, 
W. N. McKee; Tennessee History, J. B. Powers; Bookkeeping, 
J. H. Wardroper ; Orthography, Mrs. W. N. McKee; Reading, 
Miss Kate Rodgers; Geography, Miss Maggie Lyle; School 
Management, Superintendent P. L. Harned. 
A schedule of recitations was arranged and each subject was 
taken up at its proper time. 
T am glad to state that the Instructors did the most faithful _ 
work we have ever had, and that the teachers attending were
-P-A-G-E-183
cee es 
unanimous in declaring the proceedings a complete success—so 
much so that they voted unanimously to make the 1900 term two 
weeks instead of one. 
The programme throughout was arranged especially for teach- 
ers, consequently we had but few visitors. We are convinced — 
that, in order to give the teachers practical benefits, the exercises 
must be arranged for teachers, and not to entertain the public; 
that, as much as possible, the exercises should be attended by 
teachers only, for then they can discuss important matters which 
are kept back when visitors are present. 
We find our enrollment of teachers this year was sixty-eight, 
while the average daily attendance was fifty-five. When we 
compare the number enrolled with the actual number of white 
teachers employed in the county schools (seventy-two), we find 
that nearly every teacher attended the County Institute, and, 
besides, twenty attended the State Peabody Institute at Dickson. 
I am sure we can see some good results coming from Institute ~ 
work this year. ; i 
The Institute for colored teachers of this county was con- 
ducted at the courthouse, Clarksville, during the week begin- 
ning on July 17, 1899. Conductor, Superintendent P. L. 
Harned; Chairman, William Coke; Secretary, Bailey Cobb. 
The Instructors were: In Arithmetic, English, and School Man- 
agement, Superintendent P. L. Harned; American History, A. 
E. Clardy; Physiology, Joe Davie; Tennessee History, J. W. 
Carraway; Penmanship, G. W. Hudson; Algebra, William Coke. 
Good work was done by the Assistant Instructors, and never 
was more interest taken by the colored teachers during the nine 
years of Institute work in this county. There are many good 
workers among our colored teachers, and I am glad to say that 
a majority of the teachers are not sleeping, but are improving in 
scholarship as well as in method. 
The enrollment was sixty-three, and the daily attendance was 
fifty-five, while the number employed outside of Clarksville to 
teach is forty, which shows that all our teachers were in the In- 
stitute, and also several others who want to become teachers. 
The colored teachers passed resolutions asking that the term~
-P-A-G-E-184
—1i3— 
of the next. Institute be two weeks instead of one. -I may say, 
too, that some of them, in addition to the Institute work, take a 
course in some summer school. Several are making an effort to 
secure in the future First Grade certificates, and three have 
already succeeded. 
In making my annual report of Institutes, I desire to call 
attention to the Montgomery County Teachers’ Association, 
which is a permanent organization, and meets at the County 
Superintendent’s office on the second Saturday of each month, 
for it is doing some excellent work. This organization has been 
in existence six years, and is the real founder of the splendid 
library at this place. There are regular Instructors selected 
and substantial work is done. A regular course of study is laid 
out for each year and completed. Last year we carried three 
studies, as follows: History of Education, J. G. Rollow, In- 
structor; Ethics, W. N. McKee, Instructor; English, Superin- 
tendent P. L. Harned, Instructor. This has been one of the 
most interesting courses ever arranged here. We used standard 
texts, had a definite task assigned one month in advance of the 
discussion, and every Instructor took special interest in making 
his department thorough. At the close of the year’s work an 
examination is given, and all who make satisfactory marks are 
given credit on a regular course of four years. The following 
are active members: J. G. Rollow, H. L. Faubion, Elliott Buck- 
ner, George Evans, S. O. Roberts, W. I. Harper, J. H. Work- 
man, W. N. McKee, R. H. Craig, A. T. Felts, and P. L. 
Harned; Misses Kate Rodgers, Lucy Barbee, Emma Haynes, 
and Nellie Kearney; Mrs. Emma Taylor and Mrs. Annette Me- 
Kee. While this list embraces those taking the course, I may 
say that there are some others who attend, but, not being active 
members, are not counted.

The Moore County Teachers’ Institute met in the Lynchburg

It was conducted on the recitation plan, and by the teachers. 
The Institute was a success, and teachers and patrons were great-

MORGAN COUNTY. 
  
A. J. Albertson, Superintendent. 
  
I herewith submit my annual report, in which I am pleased 
to state that our schools are in a better condition and more im- 
proved than ever before. We have a better grade of teachers, 
and they seem more interested in fitting themselves for the work 
and take more interest in attending teachers’ meetings than at 
any time before. 
Our County Institute was held at Wartburg, beginning on 
July 17 and ending on July 28, 1899. Sixty-eight teachers at- 
tended the Normal. The number of teachers in the county who 
did not attend was twelve, but six of these attended the State 
Normal at Harriman, so there were only six who did not attend 
any Normal. Some of the teachers attended both the State and 
County Normals. 
Prof. R. L. MeDonnold, of Nashville, was the Conductor of 
our County Normal, and he gave splendid satisfaction, and his 
Institute work was much appreciated by all the teachers attend- 
ing.

OBION COUNTY. 
  
R. L. Bynum, Superintendent. 
  
The State Institute which has been held in this county for 
five or six years has done a great deal for the uplifting of the 
schools. Nearly all of my county. teachers attended the Insti- 
tute last June, and, as a result, I find a higher grade of scholar- 
ship and more of professional atmosphere among the teachers. _ 
We have a regular monthly Association, which does much for 
the professional spirit. 
~ Our County Library is another important factor for raising 
the standard of teaching. 
The new books are in most of the schools, and are giving satis- 
faction. 
Our pro rata is from $3.25 to $3.50, which gives us an average 
term of six months a year. We hope to get two or three county 
high schools next year. 
The outlook is bright for an educational advancement in the 
future. 
OVERTON COUNTY. 
A. H. Roberts, Superintendent. 
  
Hon. Elbert Kimes, County Superintendent of Overton 
County, died on October 4, 1899, after an illness of more than 
two months. This acccunts for the delay in sending in this 
report. At your request, I mail you a report which is as nearly 
correct as it is possible to make it from data at hand. In all 
essential particulars it is correct. 
Prot. Homer L. Higgs, principal of Nebo High School, Nebo, 
Tenn., conducted a two-weeks’ Institute at this place. With 
possibly two exceptions, every teacher in the county attended

the Institute. Professor Higes gave entire satisfaction in every 
respect. The presence of the State Superintendent at the Insti- 
tute was a great encouragement. You will long be remembered 
by the teachers and people of Overton County as the first State 
Superintendent to visit the county. Your energy and earnest- 
ness are already being felt here. 
The teachers have organized a Library Association, which 
-promises to arouse much interest in educational work. 
Our teachers are almost unanimously in favor of the text- 
book law. 
The County Court is waking-up and levying more taxes for 
the support.of schools. During the scholastic year beginning 
on July 1, 1899, the schools will run on an average about one 
month longer than heretofore. This is due to a progressive 
spirit in the County Court. * 
PBPRRY COUNTY. 
J. R. Godwin, Superintendent. 
  
The schools of Perry County are not what they should be, but 
they are gradually improving. The teachers are becoming bet- 
ter qualified every year for their work, and we are having the 
best teaching this year that we have ever had. The directors do 
not look after the schools as much as they should, but this year 
both directors and patrons are manifesting more interest than 
usual, 
T think it would be much better for us if we had fewer school 
districts. We have eleven civil districts and forty-nine school 
districts, and we could have longer and better schools if the 
County Court would reduce’ the number. 
I would be glad to be able to send you a report of a successful 
annual Institute for Perry County. but the County Court would 
not make an appropriation for this work, and, as my salary is 
small, I did not feel that I could pay an Instructor myself. We
-P-A-G-E-188
hi 
are having two-days’ Institutes in different parts of the county, 
and they are well attended by both teachers and citizens. We . 
have made arrangements for next year that will enable us to em- 
ploy one first-class Instructor. 
PICKETT COUNTY. 
W. J. Chilton, Superintendent. 
  
-Under prevailing conditions, the schools of Pickett County 
have done well this season. The directors, as a rule, are very 
indifferent toward educational interests. Some of them will 
scarcely give their school a passing glance, and it very rarely 
occurs that a director visits a school in this county. 
Nearly all the schools were visited by me this season, and in 
several instances schools were visited more than once. I have 
found the teachers working with energy and exhibiting a proper 
degree of interest in their work. The grade of teachers is im- 
proving very rapidly in this county. Many of them take edu- 
cational journals, and nearly all of them attend school during the 
winter months. 
It is with a great deal of satisfaction that I ean state that T 
had the hearty codperation of nearly all the teachers: in intro- 
ducing the new text-books. We had but little trouble along this 
line of our work. In a few instances we met with opposition, 
but in most cases it was easily overcome. : 
Upon the whole, the outlook for the future is very encour- 
aging; and from the seed now being sown, we are confidently 
assured that a much better harvest than hitherto known will be 
realized.

POLK COUNTY. 
J.D. Clemmer, Superintendent. 
  
The Polk County Teachers’ Institute met at Springtown on 
July 10, 1899, and continued four days. Out of the sixty-seven 
teachers of this county, sixty-three were in attendance. The 
Conductor, Prof, A. B. Nicholson, has had fourteen years’ expe- 
“rience in Institute work, and never did better work than during 
this Institute. In addition to the teachers, there were present a 
number of directors and magistrates. J. E. Rollins was the 
efficient Secretary of the Institute. It was decided to have three 
Institutes during the coming year. The Polk County Teachers’ 
Union held several meetings during the week, and the names of 
several new members were enrolled. Among the prominent 
visitors was Prof. M. R. M. Burke, of MeMinn County, who 
held the first Institute in Polk County. 
PUTNAM COUNTY. 
H. D. Whitson, Superintendent. 
There was in Putnam County some confusion during the 
period in which the old schoolbooks gave place to the newly 
adopted books. After the exchange was completed, all became 
harmonious, and exceedingly good work has been done by pupils 
and teachers. I have attended the closing exercises of a number 
of schools, and am glad to report good work done by teachers 
and satisfaction given to patrons. The grade of teachers is 
higher than for years past. .I have held more Institutes this 
year than ever before, and the interest manifested in them by 
teachers, directors, and patrons has been highly satisfactory.

RHEA COUNTY, 
  
W. #. Rogers, Superintendent. 
  
The teachers of Rhea County, in a monthly Institute, decided 
that they would have a three-weeks’ Normal, and that.the In- 
structors should be selected by the County Superintendent from 
the number. More than four hundred circulars announcing 
the Normal, its purposes, the course of study, what would be 
expected of the teachers, and giving the names of the Instructors, 
with their respective studies, were distributed throughout this 
and adjoining counties. When the time arrived for the Normal 
to commence, the teachers were ready and anxious to begin the 
work, and the best citizens were manifesting an interest in the 
success of the Normal. 
The Normal opened at Dayton, the county seat of Rhea 
County, with W. E. Rogers, the County Superintendent, as Con- 
ductor, on July 3, 1899, and continued three weeks, closing on 
July 22. 
Nearly every teacher in the county (whether intending to 
teach or not), the young and the old of the profession, attended 
and many from other counties came and joined in the good work. 
Although there are only sixty white teachers required in the 
county, there were more than eighty teachers in attendance, and 
the average number was fully sixty. ‘With a few exceptions, 
the teachers who expected to teach in the county were present 
every day of the meeting, and seemed to take pride and pleasure 
in being on time and being prompt in all their work. 
The work was carried on very much on the same plan as that 
in a thoroughly organized, systematie Normal School. The 
chief. aim was not to learn how to impart something that the 
teachers knew nothing of, but that they might learn and know, 
and thus have something to impart. Methods of teaching are 
certainly secondary to a thorough knowledge of the subjects to 
be taught. We need fewer “ method cranks” and more teach- 
_ ers who have the courage and mental capacity to enter the depths 
of knowledge and master the subjects they are required to teach.
-P-A-G-E-191
— 180 — 
The work of our monthly Institutes is given principally to the 
study of Methods, Psychology, and Pedagogy. 
The daily sessions began at 8 o’clock A.M. and closed at 4 
o’clock P.M., with a number of short intermissions during the 
day. The work was systematically arranged, and each subject 
was given so many minutes. Discussions on technical points 
were restrained, and even stopped, when the welfare of the 
work demanded. The Instructors, being informed at least two 
months before what they would be expected to do, had their work 
outlined and thoroughly prepared, and even surprised their fel- 
low-teachers by doing such efficient and commendable work. 
The home Instructors were not entirely alone in their work, 
for a number of colleges were notified through personal letters 
of the Normal, and invited to send representatives during the 
session. The result was, the Normal was favored by a number 
of addresses and lectures from visiting school and college men. 
The teachers were also delighted to have with them the State 
Superintendent, who delivered two able and instructive ad- 
dresses, and who answered many of the perplexing school ques- 
tions to their satisfaction. The teachers manifested their ap- 
proval of, and their hope for the success of, the rigid course of 
our State Superintendent by the adoption of the following reso- 
lution: 
“Resolved, That we appreciate fully the interest manifested 
by our State Superintendent in our common schools, our County 
Normal, and in advancing the standard of our teachers; and we 
believe that through his energy, aided by the late improvement 
in our school laws, our educational interest will receive an im- 
petus hitherto unknown in our State.” 
At the close of the Normal the first annual examination based 
entirely upon the work of the Normal was held, to which were 
admitted only those who had attended the Normal. Out of the 
fifty-five applicants, ten received First Grade certificates, thirty- 
nine received Third Grade certificates, and six failed to make 
the average required by law for any grade of certificate. 
In the business session, before the final adjournment, the 
teachers adopted a Reading Course, to become a part of the pro-
-P-A-G-E-192
— 1381 — 
gramme of the monthly Institutes; and a committee was ap- 
pointed to draft a Constitution and By-laws for a Teachers’ Li- 
brary Association, and to report at the first monthly meeting. 
The Normal was a grand success and excelled even the expec- 
tations of its most ardent workers. Never before in the history 
of Rhea County were there stronger, better, and more enthu- 
siastie teachers than these who labored so earnestly and har- 
moniously in this Normal. They have gone forth with more 
power, higher ideals, and nobler conceptions of their work, to 
do that most important work—to train-the boys and girls of our 
Jand. We have committed much to their care, and only the 
future can reveal the fruitage of their labors. 
ROANE COUNTY. 
B. F, Brown, Superintendent. 
The County Institute for Roane County convened at Kingston 
on July 19, 1899, and continued one week. The School Board 
of Kingston kindly tendered us the use of Rittenhouse Academy 
in which to hold the sessions of the Institute. The enrollment 
was not as large as at former Institutes, but was very good. I 
employed Profs. D. H. Jones and W. H. Taylor to assist me in 
the work of the Institute. We held two sessions each day, and 
the teachers gave us the closest attention and much aid during 
the entire term. The teachers were a unit in saying this was 
the most successful Institute ever held in Roane County, and 
regretted very much that it was not of two weeks’ duration. 
The attendance at former Institutes has been larger, but not 
more regular. The teachers seemed to get right into the very 
spirit of the work from the start. I feel that there was an in- 
terest created among the teachers of Roane County during this - 
Institute that will be lasting and prove to be the upbuilding of 
the schools of Roane County. We tried to arouse a spirit of 
investigation among the teachers; to illustrate by actual work
-P-A-G-E-193
== 182 — 
or example the best methods of conducting a recitation, man- 
aging a class, ete. Nothing was taken for granted, but a good 
reason was required for every statement. 
The teachers unanimously passed a resolution asking that all 
teachers who do not attend our Institutes be required to give a 
good reason for not attending, or that they be dropped from the 
roll of teachers. 
While the enrollment only reached sixty, I feel confident that 
the work was a success. Quite a number of the teachers took 
advantage of the State Institute at Harriman, and I am really 
sorry that every teacher in Roane County could not attend the 
State Institute, for the instructions were of the very best. Our 
schoolroom motto is: “ Not how much, but how weil.” 
ROBERTSON COUNTY. 
  
A. D. Breshear, Superintendent. 
The annual Institute for Robertson County met in Spring- 
field on June 5, 1899, and continued six days, with ex-State Su- 
perintendent Gilbreath as Conductor. We certainly had one of 
the best Institutes ever held in the County, when suddenly a 
reported case of smallpox made it necessary to adjourn. , 
Professor Gilbreath won the admiration of us all by his mas- 
terly as well as skillful manner of imparting to all the profes- 
sional methods of modern teaching. He paid us a high com- 
pliment in saying that we were the equal of any body of teachers 
in any county in the State. He was unanimously invited to be 
with us next year. 
We had eighty-one teachers present on the day of adjourn- 
ment. We would have had one hundred present, but for the 
smallpox scare. ' 
We held a two-weeks’ Institute for the colored teachers, con- 
ducted by Profs. Inge, of Louisville, and B. M. Thompson, 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
— 183 — 
of Nashville. This Institute was well attended and resulted in 
great good to the teachers. 
_ We have seventy-nine school journals read by as many teach- 
ers in this county. Many of our teachers are making Psy- 
chology a special study. Our monthly Teachers’ Meetings are 
usually well attended. In fact, the outlook for the public schools 
was never so bright as at present. Greenbrier, Orlinda, Cedar 
Hill, Adams, and Coopertown all have splendid schools about 
nine months in the year. 
We have followed to the letter the State Superintendent’s in- 
structions on examinations. We have pruned and weeded out 
the incompetent teachers in this county for five years, until now 
nearly all of our teachers have certificates averaging from 90 to 
- 98 per cent. We expect to put into operation the new text-book 
law as the law directs. 
RUTHERFORD COUNTY. 
Miss Jeannette M. King, Superintendent. 
  
The thirteenth annual Institute of Rutherford County was 
in session at Murfreesboro from June 5 to June 12, 1899. The 
Conductor was Superintendent W. E. Lumley, of Pulaski. He 
was assisted by Miss Thenie McLemore, of Murfreesboro; Miss 
A. G. Glover, of the Winthrop School, Nashville; and Dr. James 
_M. King, of the University of Nashville. Eighty-four teachers 
were enrolled, and, including interested visitors, there was a 
daily attendance of from one hundred and twenty-five to one 
hundred and seventy-five. This was the best County Institute 
_ ever held here. The attention given to the Instructors was good 
_ ¢nd the results were highly satisfactory. June,9 was Directors’ 
- jOay, and live subjects were discussed upon this and all other

SCOTT COUNTY.

The Scott County Teachers’ Institute was in session at Hunts- 
ville from June 26 to July 8, 1899. It was conducted by Su- 
perintendent Cross, who was assisted by D. R. Case, C. W. Mur- 
phy, and Miss Anna Ryall. Much interest was manifested, and 
ninety-four teachers were in attendance. The Scott County 
Teachers’ Association meets every month. 
SEQUATCHIE COUNTY. 
R. A, Stewart, Superintendent. 
The public schools of our county have done good work for the 
past year. One great hindrance to the real good which should 
be accomplished by the public schools is the lack of money to run 
them long enough. Our County Court makes a very liberal 
allowance for school purposes, but some of the districts have a 
very small tax aggregate and are sparsely settled, which makes 
the school money very little. 
We believe, though, that better work is being done than has 
been done for some years past. Our people approve the text- 
book law recently put into operation. The books are better than 
most of those formerly used, and much less money is expended 
for books. Our teachers are very capable. However, we want 
the standard raised, and want the very best teachers we can pos- 
sibly secure. f

The attendance of pupils is very good; only a small per cent 
fail to attend. We are glad to note the marked interest parents 
.and the people generally are taking in education. They are 
fully awake to the advantages of public schools and the impor- 
tance of educating their children. 
Our county has the best schoolhouses of any county of its size 
and wealth in the State. There are only one or two which are 
not comfortable enough to have school all the year. They are 
neat and well kept. It will only be a short time until our county. 
will be equal to the best in the State in educational matters. 
SEVIER COUNTY. 
  
® John J. Massey, Superintendent. 
  
While we had no aid from the State nor from the county, this 
year’s Institute has been the most profitable one to the teachers 
for many years. It has been more largely and more regularly 
attended, with more interest manifested on the part of teachers, 
than ever before. I attribute this intense interest and my sue 
cess to the fact that by preparing a programme one month be- 
fore the time of meeting, and by writing personal letters to my 
teachers and assigning to each of them some special work to be 
prepared and given some time during the Institute, T made them 
feel that this work was theirs; that the Institute belonged to 
them; and that each one of them, in a measure, would be re- 
sponsible for the success or failure of the meeting. 
_The Institute met at Sevierville promptly at 9:30 o’clock 
A.M. (the appointed hour), on July 31, 1899. When the first 
roll was taken there were found to be present one hundred and 
forty teachers. During the week the enrollment reached one 
hundred and sixty. I must say for our teachers that I have 
never seen more active work so willingly done in an Institute 
as has been done by our county teachers-this year. Not one re- 
_ fused to do the work assigned him. When the various subjects 
as
-P-A-G-E-199
— 186 — 
were called, each one was ready, either with a well-prepared 
manuscript or with a carefully prepared outline and thorough 
preparation on his subject. I must say, further, for the teach-— 
ers, that some of the papers read on the various subjects dis- 
cussed were the most excellent papers it has been my pleasure to 
read or listen to. 
We were glad to receive so much encouragement from promi- 
nent visiting teachers and ministers. Prof. William M. Gray- 
bill, of the Nashville Synod, and president of the Synodical Col- 
lege at Rogersville, was with us two days, and in his most ex- 
cellent talks on Physiology, History, etc., won completely the 
highest respect and confidence of all who heard him. His lee- 
ture on “ Our Constitution”? was especially instructive and 
helpful to teachers and those of the legal and other professions 
who were present to hear him. 
The Institute continued six days, and some examinations were 
held each day, excepting Monday, the first day. Out of one 
hundred and fifty who wrote on examinations, thirty-eight failed 
to make the required average; still, we have enough teachers to 
supply all the schools without a second examination. 
Some interesting reports were made at the annual meeting of 
the Teachers’ Library Association, giving the number and kind 
of books read by each teacher during the year, etc. The Associa- 
tion holds regular monthly meetings during the school months, 
and meets every two months during the remainder of the year. 
We have an arrangement with our two county newspapers to 
furnish subject-matter for two columns each week, which col- 
umns are designated as the “ Educational Column,” and whose 
editors are elected from the Association of teachers. Through 
this medium every teacher has an opportunity to give and receive 
_help on the many perplexing questions which arise in the school- 
room.

SHELBY COUNTY. 
  
Mrs. Lyde P. Thomas, Superintendent. 
  
The school system of Shelby County is steadily improving, 
and we are hopeful of good results from the coming year, All 
schools are graded and managed systematically. The majority 
of the teachers study their work, plan and outline supplementary 
work to text-books, and keep in touch with the methods of the 
leading teachers of the land by reading the best educational jour- 
nals. Though the course of work is outlined and required by 
the Superintendent, teachers are given much scope for origi- 
nality in their teaching. 
The library is beginning to be a potent factor in the education 
of the rural children, and several schools now possess a nice 
library and can show excellent results from its usage. 
All schools are well supplied with reading and language 
charts, maps, and apparatus. Vertical writing was adopted last 
year and is being successfully taught. Physical culture is being 
taught in every school, and sight singing in many. 
The monthly meetings of teachers are well attended and much 
interest is manifested. This year the teachers confine them- 
selves to schoolroom work, taking up a subject. by grades, each 
teacher giving an outline of the subject-matter, with methods 
for a particular grade. These practical lessons, followed by dis- 
cussions, are productive of much good to the teachers. 
The School Directors’ Association meets twice a year, and at 
these meetings the directors discuss topics of interest. to the 
county in general.

SMITH COUNTY.

The Teachers’ Institute for Smith County was held in the 
courthouse at Carthage from June 12 to June 17, 1899. Sub-
-P-A-G-E-201
ae aa 
jects had been previously assigned some of the leading teachers 
of the county. The Instructors were requested to emphasize 
equally matter and method, which was ably and well done. 
Prof. R. L. Couch, president of J. W. Allen College, gave 
yaluable instruction in Written Arithmetic, and Anatomy, Phys- 
iology, and Hygiene. The bad effects of alcohol and tobacco 
upon the vital organs were forcibly illustrated by his fine ana- 
tomical charts. 3 
Professor Wood, also of the J. W. Allen College, illustrated 
many principles of Physics, especially of electricity, by the use 
of the philosophical apparatus of the college. He also gave 
many good points in methods of teaching Geography. 
Hon. D. M. Johnson aroused great interest in Tennessee His- 
tory by his masterly lectures and stirring questions. 
Professor Mitchell gave excellent instruction in Geometry 
and Intellectual Arithmetic, and had some logical, clear-cut, 
model demonstrations and solutions given. 
Prof. W. E. Wilkerson gave forcible and enthusiastic lectures 
upon United States History and Civil Government. 
Prof. B. N. Hicks led the teachers into the beautiful intrica- 
cies of English Grammar. ; 
The interest of the exercises was enhanced by recitations, 
music, essays, speeches, and orations. 
Thursday evening, in the Baptist Church, the teachers and 
citizens were instructed and entertained by Revs. J. B. Jor- 
dan, T. J. Eastes, and T. T. Thompson, on the respective sub- 
jects, “The Physical Man,” “The Intellectual Man,” “ The 
Moral Man.” : 
The enrollment of teachers on the first day was one hundred. 
This afterwards reached one hundred and seventeen. 
The great variety and breadth of subjects discussed by the 
essayists and speakers, the enthusiasm aroused by the Instruet- 
ors, and the foree and power of such an intelligent body of pro- 
eressive educators attracted a large audience of enlightened 
citizens, and each day the courthouse was filled with appreciative 
hearers. : 
The committee on selection of suitable books for the Teachers’
-P-A-G-E-202
— 189 — 
Reading Circle recommended “ Educational Foundations ”’ and 
“ Boyer’s Principles and Methods of Teaching,” which were 
adopted. The most practical subjects will be assigned in order, 
studied at home, and discussed at the five meetings of the Asso- — 
ciation during the year. Teachers are required to pass an ex- 
amination upon these subjects, which will come under the head 
of Theory and Practice. 
The examination on Friday and Saturday revealed the fact 
that many of’the teachers are not broad enough, and that their 
general information and breadth of vision should be widened. 
The Institute, in its enlightening and stimulating effects, was 
pronounced by the legal profession of Carthage to have been a 
grand success. 
The Institute for the colored teachers was held in their school 
building in Gordonsville from June 19 to June 24,1899. T. L. 
Ballow and J. R. Inman were the Conductors, assisted by W. 
TL. Cash and Miss Lucy Manning. About thirty-five teachers — 
were enrolled. A most harmonious, interesting, and profitable 
Institute was held. Some excellent teachers from the. colored 
colleges of Nashville were in attendance and added much to the 
pleasure and profit of the meetings. The Teachers’ Association 
was continued and new officers were elected. The same course 
- of reading as the white teachers pursue was adopted. The col- 
ored people are to be commended for their rapid progress in 
educational lines. 
STEWART COUNTY.

The Stewart County Teachers’ Institute was held at Dover,

was conducted by Superintendent Norden; W. L. McElroy was 
Secretary. The Institute was conducted on the recitation plan, 
the Conductor being assisted by A. Bogart and G. K. Grant. It
-P-A-G-E-203

teachers showed their appreciation of the instruction given. A 
- course of professional reading was adopted by the teachers. 
SULLIVAN COUNTY. 
  
J. E. L. Seneker, Superintendent. 
  
I am now quite familiar with the educational work in this 
county, even in its minutie, and I am pleased to ae that there 
is a very satisfactory upward and onward move “all along the 
line.” 
Our last annual Institute was far more successful than any 
other held in this county, at least during my incumbency as Su- 
perintendent. I was very ably assisted by Profs. R. E. Wolfe 
and R. H. Freeland, both ex-County Superintendents and vet- 
eran Institute workers. More teachers were in attendance tee 
we have positions to fill. The visitors were many. 
In accordance with instructions from the State Superintend- 
ent, I am ruling all not legally exempt to a rigid examination, 
and, as a result, many would-be teachers and not a few “school 
keepers” court disappointment. Poor spellers, and especially 
those whose examination papers evidence the fact that their 
knowledge of grammar and arithmetic is quite deficient, are no 
longer wanted as teachers in this county. 
SUMNER COUNTY. 
W. F. Albright, Superintendent. 
  
Our annual Institute for white teachers met at Portland on

W. Caldwell, of Cottontown High School; Capt. C. S. Doug- 
lass, Superintendent of the Gallatin City Schools; Mrs. S. A. 
Green, of the Fall School, Nashville; and Miss Pattie Malone, 
ex-County Superintendent. The attendance at the Institute 
was better than it has been for several years. The teachers of 
Sumner County have come to the conclusion that nothing helps 
them in their work like attending a good Institute. 
We have monthly meetings of the teachers in different por- 
tions of the county. 
Our school term is gradually getting longer. We have a num- 
ber of good Secondary schools in the county that are run ten 
months in the year. When the public money is exhausted, the 
people subscribe and run the school on. Many of our new houses 
are built by private subscription. Upon the whole, our schools 
are advancing.

quest of the County Superintendent, reduced the number of dis- 
tricts to fifteen, with forty-five schools. The change created 
great confusion among teachers and patrons, and it has taken the 
most persistent, earnest, and patient labor to hold things to- 
gether. Therefore, for the first time in ten years, no Institute 
was held. However, the County Superintendent persuaded a 
large number of teachers to attend the State Institutes at Jack- 
son and Union City. We have built several beautiful school- 
houses at a cost of $600 each, and have arranged to establish 
eight-months’ schools at these places. The people are becoming 
reconciled to the change, and I am very hopeful of the success 
of the public schools of Tipton County. I shall not be satisfied 
until we are second to none.

TROUSDALE COUNTY. 
Lytle Dalton, Superintendent. 
  
The Trcusdale County Teachers’ Institute met at Hartsville 
on June 12, 1899, and continued one week. It was conducted 
by Prof. A. D. Wharton, of the Nashville City Schools, assisted 
by Superintendent Dalton, ex-Superintendent Martin, Profs. J. 
R. Burton and E. M: Dalton, and Misses Sadie Fitts, Clara 
Wood, Bessie Crenshaw, M. E. Winton, Lela Fitts, and Lena 
Redditt. Mrs. Alice Clemens and Prof. A. C. Webb, of Nash- 
ville, were visitors, to whom the Institute was much indebted 
for able assistance. The Institute was honored by the presence 
of State Superintendent Fitzpatrick and County Superintend- 
ent H. N. Donoho, of Macon County. As Institutes were held _ 
in both Smith and Sumner Counties during this week, the Insti- 
tute was attended by only Trousdale County teachers. The 
teachers present were very grateful to the State Superintendent 
for his sending them so able an Instructor as Professor Whar- 
ton. There were five teachers in the county who did not attend, 
they being prevented by illness. The Institute was. indebted to 
Misses Clara Wood, Lula Willis, Ethyl Carr, and Cora Frank- 
lin and Mrs. J. T. Allen for excellent music. 
The Institute for colored teachers was conducted by J. B. 
Batte, of Nashville, and much good work was done. During its 
sessions it was visited by the State Superintendent, the County 
Superintendent, ex-County Superintendent Martin, and Prof. ~ 
A. D. Wharton. 
UNICOI COUNTY. 
Mrs. Lizzie Roberts, Superintendent. 
  
The Unicoi County Teachers’ Institute, which was in session 
at Erwin on July 12, 13, and 14, 1899, was one of the best Insti- 
tutes ever held-in the county. There were thirty-six teachers in
-P-A-G-E-206
loo 
regular attendance. Prof. J. Hopwood, of Milligan College, 
was one of the principal Instructors. Prof. F. E. Lindsley, 
principal of the High School at Flag Pond; Prof. J. T. Pope, 
of Piney Flats; and Prof. H. P. Cory, of Tusculum College, 
assisted him. Professor, Hopwood lectured one night on “ The 
Christian Influence of the Teacher; ” Professor Cory, the next 
night, on “ Hiawatha; ” ex-Superintendent R. W. H. Gilbert, 
the next night, on ‘‘ The Model Teacher.” The interest of the 
community was above the average, and there was a good attend- 
ance both day.and night. The School Directors of the county 
also attended fairly well. This has never been the case before. 
The teachers were all much benefited by the Institute. 
UNION COUNTY.   
Miss Nola Harless, Superintendent. 
  
The Union County Normal was held at Maynardville on July 
11-15,1899. Much interest was shown by the teachers. Every 
teacher in the county was present. Sixty-one persons were ex- 
‘amined. Of the sixty-one examined, twenty-one failed to pass 
the examination. 
A second Normal was held at Paulett. At this Normal twelve 
were examined, and ten passed the examination. 
There have been Institutes held all over the county, and there 
seems to have been a revival of every educational interest. this 
year. : 
The new books met with some opposition, but the teachers and 
parents have been made to see that a uniformity of text-books is 
the best. 
A movement to establish a Teachers’ Library was set on foot 
last July. There will be one hundred volumes in it by Christ- 
mas. We expect to add to it one hundred volumes each year. 
Our schools are very short; they average four months. The 
salaries of teachers are small; the average salary paid to teach- 
ers is $25 per month. The County Superintendent’s salary is 
only $100 per year. We need longer schools and better salaries. _

VAN BUREN COUNTY. 
L. 8. Gillentine, Superintendent. 
‘ 
The Van Buren County Teachers’ Institute, which was in ses- 
sion at Spencer for one week, beginning on May 22, 1899, was 
largely attended by teachers and patrons. There were fifty 
_ teachers enrolled. Prominent participants in the exercises were 
Profs. J. T. Barnes, of Sequatchie College, and John Boyd, of 
Roleta. 
WARREN COUNTY. 
J. B. Clark, Superintendent. 
The work of the year was begun and finished under the gen-: 
eral plan explained in previous reports. With a few exceptions, 
the schools have been well,managed and well taught. A strong 
sentiment favoring free education is quite universal; therefore, 
there has been a practical diligence and devotion to the cause 
that has given us splendid results. No effort has been made to 
excite or give undue stimulation to the work, but a reasonable 
degree of enthusiasm and energy has prevailed and the usual 
advances have been made in every department of work. We 
could not be satisfied with slow progress, but would choose it 
rather than seasons of retrogression or continual conflict with 
error; therefore, we have tried to cultivate a cautious diligence 
and to acquire the habit of thinking well before acting, that our 
growth may be right and substantial. : 
T have visited all the schools of the county during the school 
term, and have been pleased, in the main, with what I have seen 
and heard. I regret to say that I visited a few schools that were 
void of real worth, yet it is gratifying to know that at least 
90 per cent of our schools are taught by conscientious men and 
women, who are making reasonable progress in honest efforts to
-P-A-G-E-208
  = 195 
popularize true education from the position of a real teacher. 
Among improvements that merit special mention are improved 
discipline and methods of teaching. In these particulars most 
of our schools have been good all the time; but we have cer- 
tainly attained to a greater unity of opinion as to what good 
school management and methods are, and have become more 
unanimous in our efforts to employ them. 
Our Teachers’ Association meets monthly, and more interest 
is being manifested now than ever before. 
Here I wish to state that the State Institute that you gave us 
last July did one of the greatest works ever performed on our 
public school system in the way of giving encouragement and 
spirit to our directors and teachers. We were all pleased so very 
well with. the work of those engaged by the State that nearly 
every teacher of the county attended the Institute; but I believe 
this is only the beginning of a greater work which can be finished 
by giving this people a chance again next July. I shall always 
remember Dr. Kennedy, Captain Garrett, and Professors Brooks 
and Billingsley for their faithful work. 
WASHINGTON COUNTY. 
  
S. W. Murray, Superintendent. 
  
I have the pleasure of reporting the most interesting and 
best-attended Institute in the history of Washington County. 
The Institute opened on July 31, 1899, and continued two weeks. 
It was conducted by the County Superintendent, assisted by 
Miss Nellie O’Donnell, of Memphis, and O. M. Dugger, of 
Greeneville. The work throughout was of the highest order 
‘and commendable in every respect. Both teachers and Con- 
ductors were ever ready to perform each and every duty. The 
total enrollment reached one hundred and five. Only eighty- 
; four white teachers are required to supply the county public 
schools. Every teacher holding a position in our county schools
-P-A-G-E-209
e106 — 
_this year was in attendance at the Institute, except three. Of 
these, two were from adjoining counties, and attended the 
County Normal at home and took the regular examination. 
Washington County is rapidly forging to the front. Our 
' teachers are equipped with a well-selected County Library, and _ 
have adopted a systematic course of reading for the coming 
year. 7 
The County Superintendent and teachers of Washington 
County feel very grateful to the State Superintendent for his 
interest manifested in our behalf. 
WAYNE COUNTY. 
S. D. Bromley, Superintendent. 
  
The Wayne County Teachers’ Institute was held at Waynes- 
boro, beginning on June 26, 1899, and closing on July 8. It 
  was conducted by Superintendent Bromley, assisted by T. F. — 
MeAnallay, Joseph Sims, G. W. Sweonly, W. Z. Stucklin, and 
Riley Davis. ighty-five teachers were in attendance. The 
Institute was a very interesting one, the teachers all doing good 
work. ‘ 
WEAKLEY COUNTY. 
S. 8. Featherston, Superintendent. 
  
Owing to smallpox raging in our county during the summer 
months, we had no County Institute, but have had monthly In- 
stitutes since February. We had two Teachers’ Training Terms 
of six weeks each in the months of May and June, which gave 
most of our teachers as good training as an Institute. 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
io 
At our last meeting we organized our teachers into a body 
known as “The Weakley County Educational Association.” ° 
We have been cordially invited by the good citizens to hold a 
meeting at least once a month at different points in our county, 
in order that the patrons, teachers, and school officers may be 
brought into closer touch and sympathy in the work of education. 
We have about one hundred and thirty-eight schools-in our 
county, with about one hundred and sixty teachers engaged in 
the school work. I have visited about sixty of these schools, and 
had. meetings of patrons, directors, and citizens of each district, 
and delivered to them lectures on the upbuilding of the educa- 
tional cause in their communities, especially on the grading of 
their schools and the employment of better qualified teachers, as 
a poor teacher is dear at any price, and an ungraded school is 
worse than no school at all, since it fails to impress the pupils 
with the first principle of an education, which is system in all 
things. 
Most of our teachers and school officers, and patrons as well, 
heartily indorse our new text-book law. 
‘It is of rare occurrence that a teacher is employed whose cer- 
tificate is out of date, in which case I give immediate notice to 
the directors and have the error corrected at once. 
The spirit of codperation is being felt more sensibly than ever 
before among the school officers, patrons, and teachers. Nearly 
all of our teachers are reading from two to-three good school 
journals and some work on Pedagogy, showing their very high 
aporeciation of their profession. Our schools have a fuller at- 
tendance than they have had in years past, showing that the 
- patrons are interested in education, as well as the teachers. We 
have large audiences, free and delightful dinners, and hospitable 
homes everywhere we hold our educational meetings, which 
proves to us that the people greatly appreciate what we are en- 
deavoring to do for their children. In short, our public schools - 
are much improved, financially and otherwise.

WHITE COUNTS: 
H. Camp, Superintendent. 
  
The greatest obstacle to educational progress in this county is ~ 
the disposition on the part of many of our directors to reduce 
the salaries of teachers. The result is that our best teachers, 
when they have acquired a little experience, go to new fields 
where the remuneration is more satisfactory, thus robbing our 
schools of the skill and efficiency which they have in a great 
measure created. 
Our teachers are, in the main, live, progressive young men 
and women. During the year covered by my report we have 
held our eleventh annual Summer Institute of two weeks’ dura- 
tion, all of the regular work being done by our own teachers. 
The following is the report of Miss Ella Snodgrass, the effi- 
cient Secretary of our 1899 Institute: 
The twelfth annual Institute of White County met at the 
Dibrel]l Normal, Sparta, on June 26, 1899. The session began 
with an enrollment of fifty-three, which, during the two weeks, 
increased to nearly twice that number. Much interest was 
taken in the work by the teachers, and the work was not only 
interesting, but instructive, throughout. Besides the regular 
programme, an interesting feature of the Institute was the visit 
to this county by the State Superintendent of Public Instrue- 
tion. His address in regard to the educational work was highly 
appreciated by the large audience who had the privilege of hear- 
ing him. We also had a lecture on “ The Higher Education,” 
by Prof: W. R. Webb, of Bellbuckle, who is known far and wide 
as a prominent educator. July 7 and 8, the last two days of the 
Institute, were devoted to the examination of applicants for cer- 
tificates. There were fifty applicants for Primary certificates, 
and fourteen for Secondary certificates. 
An Association is being formed by the teachers of the county 
to purchase a Teachers’ Library, in order to advance the -work 
of the teachers to that of a profession. The committee in charge 
of this matter is composed of W. R. McDowell, S. H. Proffitt, Z.
-P-A-G-E-212
a og 
T. Dake, J. F. Taylor, Mrs. Adcock, Miss Anna Breeding, Miss 
-Ovella Hudson, and Miss Ella Snodgrass. 
The same division was made in the county as was had last 
summer, for the convenience of having a monthly Institute 
within the reach of each teacher in the county. Two Institutes 
will be held in the county—one in each division—monthly. 
WILLIAMSON COUNTY. 
Fred. J. Page, Superintendent. 
  
The Williamson County Teachers’ Institute was held in the 
Tennessee Female Academy at Franklin from July 3 to July 
15, 1899. It was conducted by Superintendent Page, assisted 
by Profs. T. E. Clay, J. E. Scobey, Ernest Sparkman, B. B. 
Roberts, and E. R. Chest, and Miss Sallie Luther. The attend- 
ance was one hundred and eight. Mrs. L. Sparkman was the 
efficient Secretary. The instruction was thorough and practical, 
the teachers were very regular and attentive, and the results 
were highly gratifying to all concerned. 
The Institute for colored teachers was in session at Cleburne 
Institute during the same time (July 3-15, 1899), 
WILSON COUNTY... 
F. M. Bowling, Superintendent. 
  
The Wilson County Teachers’ Institute met in Prof.B. S. 
_ Foster’s College for Young Ladies on June 26, 1899, for a two- 
weeks’ session. The Superintendent had previously been ap- 
pointed Conductor. .The work began at once, continuing eight 
hours each day from the beginning to the close of the work. The 
one hundred and twenty teachers enrolled attended with unusual 
regularity and interest. Prof. J. H. Sykes and wife, of West 
Nashville, and Miss Maud Terrell, of Terrell College, Decherd,
-P-A-G-E-213
008 
were Instructors. Prof. J. W. Patton, of Watertown, was also 
an Instructor, with others from our own county. 
Prof. Charles A. Oakley, assisted by Professor Sykes, Revs. _ 
Smotherman and Cochran, and others, had charge of the vocal 
music, which was quite a feature in the work. 
A Model Class of first-grade and second-grade pupils was in 
charge of Mrs. Sykes for exhibiting methods with these grades. 
Our teachers received much help from this class 
Most of the work was in the form of class work, for the pur- 
pose mainly of exhibiting and discussing methods. But little 
work was done by lecture. The teachers worked and enjoyed 
it all through the session. Many felt and said that it was the 
most profitable and the most enjoyable work of this kind that 
‘Wilson County had ever seen. 
Good feeling and splendid work ran through the meeting from 
day to day, and we feel that the teachers received much needed 
strength to go forth to the noble work of training the youth of 
the grand old county of Wilson. é 
Our State Superintendent kindly aided us with a eee OES 
the State appropriation, and also visited the Institute. 
The Institute for colored teachers began on June 5, 1899, 
and continued seven days. An able Faculty of five, under the 
direction of Rev. J. R. Inman, had previously been appointed 
and organized. The body of teachers, forty-five in number, was 
organized into a class, and the branches of Primary grades were 
taught in the manner of class work in school, the Instructors 
laying especial emphasis on methods and making the matter 
yather secondary. The teachers attended regularly, worked 
hard and enthusiastically, and were much benefited. Nearly 
every colored teacher in the county was present. W. C. Wood- 
son, one of the Instructors, conducts a Normal School in Leba- 
non during the spring term. Many of the colored teachers hold 
diplomas and certificates from high institutions of learning. 
The work done was very satisfactory. 
Examinations were held at the close of each Institute. Three 
days were given to Primary branches, and, one week later, three 
days to Secondary branches. Eighty-five took the first exami-
-P-A-G-E-214
—201— 
nation, and twenty took the second. Those failing to make the 
required 85 per cent were allowed to come at the August exami- 
nation and make up the deficiency. The examinations were 
conducted under the directions of the State Superintendent. 
The plan of examination may be of interest. Envelopes with 
strips of paper within are numbered on the outside and passed 
by some disinterested person to the teachers when assembled. 
Each teacher writes his name, and both home and school ad- 
dress, also the number on the envelope, on the slip of paper, 
“places it within, and seals the envelope. He is then known 
throughout the examination by the number on the envelope, and 
signs this number instead of his name. The envelopes are col-. 
lected and filed till the close of the examination. Questions 
are then assigned. When the papers are done, they are passed 
to the Committee on Examination in another room. This com- 
mittee grades and makes record of each paper on each subject 
till done. When the grading is completed, the envelopes may 
be opened by the Superintendent and the name inserted. We 
ask each teacher to sign his paper by number after he has writ- 
ten this on it: “I have neither given nor received aid in this ex- - 
amination. Number —.” 
Examinations under this plan were very satisfactory to both 
the teachers and the Superintendent. The teachers secured for 
the schools are very satisfactory. 
The outlook for the public schools in Wilson County is en- 
eouraging. Ninety per cent or more of the school work of the 
county is done in the public schools, though they are open only 
about eighty days each year. The cost of tuition in them is only 
about one-third of what it is in othérs. The two great needs of 
these schools are regular attendance and longer terms. 
Long since the best people have become friends to the publie 
schools, and realize that it is not a question of methods or schools, 
but, Will we educate in these or not at all? 
_ We are improving, and as soon as the burden of a long-stand- 
ing railroad debt is removed we will do more. Uniformity of 
text-books will help us. Our teachers are hopeful and the peo- 
ple are encouraged.

205 — 
PEABODY NORMAL COLLEGE. 
Sir: I have the honor to present herewith my annual report 
as President of the Peabody Normal College: 
The synoptical table which follows shows the main facts of 
the attendance from the organization of the school in-1875 to 
the close of the last year (1898-99), inclusive. It will appear 
from this table that the average yéarly enrollment for the first 
twelve years was one hundred and thirty-seven (137), while the 
average yearly enrollment for the last twelve years was four _ 
hundred and sixty-seven (467). It will also appear that of the 
six hundred and four students (604) registered during the last 
year, three hundred and six (306) were from the State of Ten- 
nessee. In other words, while this College is maintained for 
the benefit of twelve Southern States, Tennessee reaps the ad- 
vantage of educating three hundred and six (306) of her sons 
and daughters for the vocation of teaching.

Early in the vacation following the close of the last year, there 
occurred the death of Dr. A. 1. Purinton, our Professor of 
Physics and Chemistry. It is impossible to form a just esti- 
mate of the value of Dr. Purinton to the Peabody Normal Col- 
lege. By his skill as an instructor, by his readiness to serve the 
College in every practicable way, and by his services as Secretary 
of the Faculty, he had made himself well-nigh indispensable to 
the institution which he had served with such absolute fidelity. 
To the students of the College he was not only a skillful in- 
structor, but an elder brother and an untiring friend. 
_ I have thought it wise to divide the combined Departments of 
Physics and Chemistry as administered by Dr. Purinton, and 
the Chair of Chemistry has been assigned to Dr. J. I. D. Hinds, 
of Cumberland University, and the Chair of Physics to Dr. J. 
M. King, who had assisted Dr. Purinton in the management of 
the combined Chairs. Other appointments have been made, as 
follows: 
Dr. Charles E. Little has been appointed to the Chair of 
Latin; Dr. E. W. Kennedy has been appointed Professor in the 
Departments of Latin and Mathematics; Prof. 8. G. Gilbreath 
has been placed in charge of the Chair of Physiology and School 
Hygiene; and Miss Mary E. Hall has been made the successor 
of Miss Venie J. Lee, who resigned her place in order to go as a 
- medical missionary to China.

Curry, I visited important schools in the States of Georgia, the 
Carolinas, and Virginia, in order to observe the condition of 
Normal instruction in these States, and more particularly to 
witness the work that was actually being done by graduates of 
this College. Wherever I went I found representatives of our 
College doing educational work of a high quality, and coming ~ 
to the front as leaders in educational thought and in school ad- 
ministration. In every instance these young men and women 
seemed to have caught the inner and characteristic spirit of the 
Normal College—the spirit of helpfulness and of devotion to 
the cause of popular education. 
Our large and growing registration has made the need of more 
space imperative. There is not a room on the College campus 
large enough to seat the entire student body. Our class rooms 
are now uncomfortably crowded, and if the attendance continues 
to increase, the proper accommodation of these students is a 
problem for solution. It seems certain that larger and more 
comfortable accommodations must be provided for this growing 
school, and it is hoped that by the codperation of the three gov- 
erning boards these needed additions to our space may be made 
without long delay. 
Our Department of Chemistry is fairly well supplied with the 
apparatus and material needed for sound instruction, but our 
Department of Physics is almost entirely destitute of apparatus. 
Indeed, it would be useless to purchase physical apparatus at the 
present juncture, for the reason that we have no laboratory to 
contain it. 
Our material and imperative needs stand as follows: The 
physical laboratory adequately supplied with modern and neces- 
sary apparatus; a much larger chapel or assembly room for pub- 
lic occasions ; a new and larger building for gymnasium, fitted 
up with bath rooms; and a commodious building for library pur 
poses. 
At a date as early as practicable additions should be made to 
the salaries of our professors. At the present rate of payment _ 
it is impossible for heads of households to give comfortable main- 
tenance to their families, and at the same time provide them-

        An improvement that will be dear to all friends of the Uni- 
versity is the construction of a beautiful fence of solid masonry 
on two sides of the campus, and it is hoped that without long de- 
lay this needed improvement will be completed. This line of 
fence, being in perfect harmony with the architecture of our 
main building, is not only a pleasing ornament to our beautiful 
campus, but is a needed protection for the trees, shrubs, and 
flowers which have been planted and preserved under peculiar 
difficulties. 
Our reorganized College of Medicine has made a most auspi- — 
cious beginning, and promises to become the leading institution 
of its kind in the South. Its standard for admission and for 
graduation is being advanced from year to year, and the exami- 
nations which our graduates stand before the Examining Boards 
in the various states are highly creditable to the fidelity and 
skill of our Medical Faculty. 
Our College of Music, by the thoroughness of its instruction, © 
is steadily winning its way to public confidence and favor, and — 
it is to be hoped that it may soon find a locus in the near vicinity ; 
of the other departments of the University.

of public life is a long and honorable one, and there is every rea- 
son to think that its prestige in this respect will be honorably 
maintained. 
Tn its original intent, the Winthrop Model School was de 
signed to represent only the lower grades of public school work; 
but by processes of steady development and growth, its course of 
study now covers eleven years of the ordinary public school cur- 
riculum. In its lower grades it draws its patronage largely 
from the city, but its higher grades attract students from the 
surrounding country. This school, as now organized and ad- 
ministered, makes it possible for a child to enter upon a course 
of instruction at the age of six years, and, by gradual transitions, 
to pass through this preparatory school into the University 
proper, and to earn a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree at a cost of 
only ten dollars a year. As soon as practicable the High School 
Course will be extended to four years, thus conforming to what 
may be called “ the American type of secondary instruction.” 
Very respectfully submitted, 
W. H. PAYNE, Chancellor. 
UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
Sir: The history of the University of Tennessee is unique in 
Many respects. Born with the Territory that preceded the State, 
it has survived a hundred and six years of varied fortunes, out- 
living all the other State colleges, and is to-day the only distinct- « 
ly State institution for higher education the State possesses. 
Its history merits more attention from the people. It has al- 
ready done a great and beneficent work for the people of Ten- 
-nessee, and is prepared to do still more. Between 1794 and 
_ 1869 the several parent institutions of the University of Ten- 
nessee gave instruction, for very moderate tuition charges, to 
nearly eight thousand persons. Since 1869, when it received 
the national land grant, the University has given free instruction
-P-A-G-E-229
=214— 
to over ten thousand others. Its graduates number over two 
thousand. 
Tennessee was the daughter of North Carolina, and through 
her and the State of Virginia traces her institutions to England. 
North Carolina and Tennessee were founded chiefly by the 
Scotch-Irish, who loved their schools next to their church, and 
established them wherever they went. So it was that the means 
of education were among the very first things provided for in the 
Constitutions made by these people. The Constitution of North 
Carolina, adopted in 1776, declared that “a school or schools 
shall be established by the Legislature for the convenient in- 
struction of youth, with such salaries to the masters paid by the 
public as may enable them to instruct at low prices; ” and that 
“ all useful learning shall be duly encouraged and promoted in 
one or more universities.” The unsettled condition of the coun- 
try prevented a compliance with this requirement until 1789, 
when the University of North Carolina was duly established. 
That the people who came over into the Western valleys from 
Virginia and North Carolina brought the same principles and 
purposes with them, is evident from many of their public acts. 
The most notable of their utterances in this connection was that 
contained in the proposed Constitution for the State of Frank- 
lin, submitted to the convention at Greeneville in 1785. This 
Constitution declared that “all kinds of useful learning shall 
be encouraged by the Commonwealth—that is to say, the future 
Legislature shall erect before the year 1787 one university, 
which shall be near the center of the State, and not in any city 
or town. And for endowing the same, there shall be appro- 
- priated such lands as may be judged necessary, one-fourth of all _ 
the moneys arising from the surveys of land hereafter to be 
made, one-half penny upon every pound of inspected tobacco, 
forever; and if the fund thence arising shall be found insuffi- 
cient, the Legislature shall provide for such additions as may 
be necessary ; and if experience shall make it appear to be useful 
to the interest of learning in this State, a grammar school shall 
be erected in each county, and such sums paid by the public as 
shall enable the trustees to employ a master or masters of ap-
-P-A-G-E-230
—-215 — 
proved morals and abilities.” Truly, a most remarkable utter- _ 
ance this for so early a day, and only to be explained when we 
learn that educated Scotch-Irish preachers wrote it. Although 
this Constitution was set aside, these principles, so firmly fixed 
in the minds and hearts of the people, were duly enacted in their 
later laws. 
The celebrated “ Ordinance for the Government of the Terri- 
tory of the United States Northwest of the River Ohio,” passed 
on July 13, 1787, contained these memorable words: “ Religion, 
morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government 
and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of educa- 
tion shall be forever encouraged.” Accordingly, when North 
Carolina ceded to the United States the territory from which 
the State of Tennessee was formed, it stipulated expressly that 
the inhabitants of the “ Territory South of the River Ohio” 
“shall enjoy all the privileges, benefits, and advantages set forth 
in ihe ordinance of the late Congress for the government of the 
territory northwest of the River Ohio.” North Carolina thus 
demanded for her people, who were to be eut off from her to 
form the new Western Territory, the same educational privileges 
which had been provided in her Constitution (Act of 1789) and 
in the Northwest Ordinance. The United States accepted this 
territory, therefore, under an obligation to provide “ schools and 
the means of education ” for its people, and right royally has it 
fulfilled its pledge. In the “Act for the Government of the Ter- 
ritory South of the River Ohio,” we find a complete recognition 
and confirmation of this covenant. It says: “ The inhabitants 
shall enjoy all the privileges, benefits, and advantages set forth - 
in the ordinance of the late Congress for the Territory North- 
west of the River Ohio.” As the only general privileges or ad- 
vantages mentioned in the Ordinance for the Northwest Terri- 
tory were “schools and the means of education,” it is evident 
that Congress intended thus to consent to and affirm the demands 
of the State of North Carolina and to bind itself to provide for 
them. 
On September 10, 1794, the fifteenth day of the first regular 
session of the First Assembly of the new Territory South of 
¢
-P-A-G-E-231
  —216— 
the River Ohio, the bill creating the mother institution of our 
State University became a law, baptizing her with the name of 
“ Pyesident and Trustees of Blount College,” in honor of Will 
jam Blount, Governor of the Territory. Col. Moses White, the 
historian of the University, claims that this was the first strictly _ 
non-denominational college established under the jurisdiction” 
of the United States—the forerunner of all the State colleges 
and universities, as distinguished from church colleges; for the 
charter of Blount College stipulated that “the Trustees shall — 
take effectual care that students of all denominations shall be_ 
admitted to the equal advantages of a liberal education, and to 
the emoluments and honors of the college; and that they shall 
receive a like fair, generous, and equal treatment during their 
residence therein.” That the great men who organized our 
State intended to found a territorial (State) college, as distin- 
guished from a local or sectarian college, is further shown by the 
men named in its charter. The Trustees were: the elegant Will- 
iam Blount, the Governor of the Territory and the friend of 
President Washington; the Secretary of the Territory; its two 
Judges ; Gen. John Sevier, ex-Governor of the State of Franklin 
and the first Governor of Tennessee; Col. William Cocke, who 
had been the mover of the Act for the college, and was after- 
wards Blount’s colleague in the Senate of the United States; 
and eleven other leading men, two of whom (Roane and Willie 
Blount) were Governors of the State, and four of whom were 
United States Senators. These noble pioneers gave the new col- 
Jege all they had to give—a charter and Trustees. They doubt- 
Jess had in mind, even then, their obligation and that of the 
United States and the Territory to the people committed to 
their care. Thus was born our present State University. 
In 1806 Congress ceded to Tennessee the vast territory of 
public lands comprising the eastern two-thirds of the present 
State. In yielding this magnificent empire, it was evidently 
mindful of the solemn covenant contained in the Northwest 
Ordinance and of the contract with the State of North Carolina 
that “schools and the means of education” should be a per- 
petual privilege to be enjoyed by the inhabitants of this soil; 
s  
-P-A-G-E-232
ies 
for, in order to insure its faithful performance after the land 
should have passed from the United States, the Act of 1806 
made it the inseparable condition of the cession that Tennessee 
should set apart within the ceded territory 100,000 acres, free 
of all incumbrances, which should be sold for not less than two 
dollars per acre, and the proceeds invested for the use of two 
colleges, one in East Tennessee and one in West (now Middle) 
Tennessee. A like amount was to be devoted to academies in. 
the counties. 
The General Assembly of Tennessee, at the session following 
the passage of this Act, accordingly established East Tennessee 
College at Knoxville, made it the heir of Blount College (which 
was merged into it), and endowed it with the proceeds of the sale 
of one-half of this land. In this manner the parent college of 
our State University received its first endowment. It was, as 
we have seen, in accordance with the requirements of the first 
Constitution of North Carolina, the Northwest Ordinance, and 
the deed of cession of the State of North Carolina, that this grant 
was made and the State College endowed. 
One would have thought that no endowment could have been 
more secure. It was guaranteed by the faith of the United 
States and the independent States, which stood to each other in 
the relation of mother and daughter. It is extremely sad, there- 
fore, to haye to record that East Tennessee College, after being 
starved for thirty-two years, secured a final settlement for this 
land and the various claims growing out of it, which, with all 
the dribblets of payments that had been made before, agereeated 
only about one-fifth of what the original $100,000 (50,000 acres 
at two dollars) should have provided.* In vain did Governors 
McMinn and Carroll call the attention of the General Assembly 
to the great wrong, and urge an investigation for the purpose of 
ascertaining how the matter stood and how it might be righted. 
The college endowment was largely frittered away by gross mis- 
management and by favoritism to squatters upon the land. 
The Tennessee Constitution of 1834 declared: “ Knowledge, 
learning, and virtue being essential to the preservation of repub- 
- * See Sanford’s “ Blount College and University of Tennessee,” pp. 60, 61.
-P-A-G-E-233
— 218 — 
lican institutions, and the diffusion of the opportunities and 
advantages of education throughout the different portions of the 
Staté being highly conducive to the promotion of this end, it shall 
be the duty of the General Assembly in all future periods of this 
government to cherish literature and science.” This Constitu- 
tion goes on to say that the common school fund “ shall remain 
a perpetual fund, the principal of which shall never be dimin- 
ished by legislative appropriation, and the interest thereof shall 
be inviolably appropriated to the support and encouragement of 
common schools throughout the State and for the equal benefit 
of the people thereof.” And then, as if to remove all doubt as 
to the meaning of the above, it adds that these provisions with 
“c pre- 
vent the Legislature from carrying into effect any laws that have regard to the common schools shall not be construed to 
been passed in favor of the colleges, universities, or academies.” 
These declarations have come down to us in the Constitution of 
1870 in almost the same language, and are therefore the law of 
the State to-day. 
The University idea has been traced, thus, back through the 
State Constitutions, the charter of Blount College, the charter of 
the Territory South of the River Ohio, the deed of cession from 
the State of North Carolina to the United States, and the North- 
west Ordinance, to the Constitution of the State of North Caro- 
lina. It is proved, therefore, beyond the possibility of denial, 
that the State of Tennessee, as the heir of this soil, is bound by 
its several Constitutions and the terms of the grant under which 
it received this territory, to “ forever encourage and maintain 
schools and the means of education.”’ That this includes a State 
university, as well as common schools, is apparent in all the Acts 
from the earliest times down to the present. The conclusion is 
irresistible, therefore, that the State of Tennessee is bound by 
the Act of cession of the State of North Carolina, the Act of Con- 
gress granting it the largest part of its territory, and by every — 
Constitution it has had, to maintain a State university which 
shall ‘ cherish literature and science.” Z 
The Act of Congress of July 2, 1862, donating public lands 
for agricultural colleges, was accepted by the General Assembly
-P-A-G-E-234
—219— 
in 1869, with all of its conditions. This Act donated certain 
Jand scrip to the several States and Territories, the proceeds of 
the sale of which should “ constitute a perpetual fund, the capi- 
tal of which shall remain forever undiminished, and the interest 
of which shall be inviolably appropriated by each State which 
may take and claim the benefit of this Act, to the endowment, 
support, and maintenance of at least one college, where the 
leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and 
classic studies, and including military tactics, to teach such 
_ branches of learning as are related to agricultural and mechanic 
arts,” ete. One of the conditions of this Act was that “ no por- 
tion of said fund, nor interest thereon, shall be applied directly 
or indirectly, under any pretense whatever, to the purchase, 
erection, preservation, or repair of any building or buildings.” 
Another section provides that “any State which may take and 
claim the benefit of the provisions of this Act shall provide, 
within five years, at least not less than one college, as described 
in the fourth section of this Act, or the grant to said State shall 
cease.” In other words, the State was to provide the college, 
with all that pertained to it, especially the land and buildings, 
while the United States provided the funds with which to carry 
it on. This land scrip was sold, the money invested in State 
bonds of the yalue of $400,000 (all except $4,000 in “ fives’), 
bearing 6 per cent interest. This institution was required to 
“ provide free instruction for two hundred and seventy-five stu- 
dents from the State of Tennessee”? in consideration of this 
endowment. At the same time, the State reorganized the Board 
of Trustees, thus taking charge of the institution. In doing so, 
the State of Tennessee did not forever discharge its obligation to 
maintain a university. On the other hand, in accepting this 
second grand trust for its State University, the State undertook 
a continuing responsibility, one that must grow with the State 
and the demands of the people. The United States Government 
has been wonderfully beneficent in its dealings with the State, 
but the State thereby is put under a greater obligation to do its 
part. 
The great need of the University of Tennessee at the present
-P-A-G-E-235
  —220 — 
time is better buildings. The original buildings, constructed 
when the Board had very little money, were of a very plain and 
simple character and are now rapidly approaching that condi- — 
tion in which repairing is expensive, and, indeed, almost im- 
possible. The institution has been suffering for the need of — 
more and better buildings for many years. It needs a great 
central academic hall for lecture rooms and offices, and it also 
needs comfortable and healthful dormitories for its students. 
It has no adequate funds with which to erect these buildings, 
but must look to the State for them. For these purposes the 
educational needs of the State demand the expenditure of no less 
than $200,000. As explained above, the Board holds now only 
$5,000 of the proceeds of the first land grant, and this is abso- 
lutely the only fund in its possession which it would have the 
right under law to use for the erection or repair of buildings. 
The Act of Congress prohibits the use of any part of the princi- 
pal or interest of the fund of 1862 for the “ erection, preserva- 
tion, or repair of any building or buildings.” The University 
locks to the State to provide for it these much-needed buildings. 
The State of Tennessee still rests under this solemn obliga- 
tion, which we have traced back through all the State Constitu- 
tions, through the Ordinance for the Territory South of the 
River Ohio, and the Acts of its Assembly, to the Constitution of 
the mother State of North Carolina, and which was confirmed 
by two great grants of the Congress of the United States, to 
build for its own people a State University. It is an obligation 
that attaches to the very territory of the State. The State ac- 
cepted it with its land and its right to govern this land ‘and its 
inhabitants. It is, therefore, an undying obligation. It has 
never been discharged; it can never be discharged except by 
building the University. When will Tennessee do this? 
Tennessee is now the only State or Territory in the American 
Union which has not taken of its own funds to build a State 
university. Can the State afford to neglect this obligation any 
longer ? , : 
The session of 1898-99 was, from the standpoint of attend- 
ance and work done, the most successful one the University has
-P-A-G-E-236
  — 221 — 
ever had. Upon examination or certificate, 94 Freshmen were 
admitted to the Academic Department—the largest class that 
ever entered the institution. The total attendance upon the 
Academie Department was 301; Law School, 45; making a to- 
tal of 346 in the Departments at Knoxville. The Medical and 
Dental Deparments, at Nashville, contained 322 additional; 
making a grand total of 668, or, omitting those counted twice, 
664. The total number of graduates in the Academic Depart- 
ment was 16; Law Department, 18; Medical and Dental Depart- 
ments, 85. : 
The new Mechanical building, Estabrook Hall, was completed 
and opened regularly for use after Christmas. Its completion 
was duly celebrated upon University ‘Day, Easter Monday, 
when an address was delivered by Dr. George F. Mellen on the 
“Life and Services of President Estabrook,” and a portrait of 
him was presented to the University by Col. Perez Dickinson, of 
Knoxville, Tenn. 
A handsome dairy and horse barn was completed at the Ex- 
periment Station farm during the same year. This is said to 
be the most complete one in the Southern States, and is a great 
_ addition to the equipment of the farm. 
The present Superintendent of Public Instruction of Ten- 
nessee has codperated actively with the President of the Univer- 
sity in carrying out the law with regard to the examination and 
appointment of students. or the first time in several years, the 
examinations were held regularly under his direction by County 
_and City Superintendents. The papers prepared at these ex- 
‘aminations are forwarded to the Faculty for grading, and the 
names of those who pass are then transmitted to the Representa- 
tives and Senators, who make the appointments to free scholar- 
ships in the Academic Department at the University. The per- 
sons thus appointed receive free registration and tuition in that 
department, which will hereafter amount to $70 a year. The 
total number of students appointed in this manner, for the ses- 
sion of 1899-1900, by Senators in the State General Assembly 
was 28, and the number appointed by Representatives was 84, 
making a total of 112 appointed by all members of the General
-P-A-G-E-237
— 222 — j 
Assembly. Considering that this plan had not been in operation 
for a number of years, this is a good showing. Under the law, 
each Representative is entitled to appoint three, and each Sen- 
ator two, qualified persons to these scholarships. The President 
is authorized to appoint to vacancies existing after the tenth day 
of August preceding each session. He has appointed up to date, 
for the session of 1899-1900, 312 persons in addition to the 
above, making a grand total of 424 appointments issued. Many 
of these appointments are issued to young men and women who ~ 
engage in teaching, who do not enter the University until after 
the Christmas holidays; and some, of course, fail to make their — 
arrangements tocome. Asa result of the assistance of the State 
Superintendent, the enrollment for this session has been still 
further increased. The Freshman class, admitted by examina- 
tion and certificate, as usual, numbers at the present time 97; 
and the total enrollment in the Academic Department is 302; 
in the Law Department, 48; making a grand total of 350 in at- 
tendance upon all the departments at Knoxville. The total 
number of students from Tennessee is 315; from other States, 
31. This is only a partial record of the year, as many will be 
added to the different departments before the end of the year. 
This is the record of only one term. An interesting feature of 
the year’s attendance is the large increase in the number of young 
women from a distance. A building was allotted to them at the 
opening of the last session. It is entirely full. One of the 
great needs of the University is a larger dormitory for women. 
In order to accommodate school-teachers and others desiring a 
convenient time for entrance, the session has been divided into 
three terms of twelve weeks each—the first term beginning on 
September 21; the second term, on January 4; and the third 
term, on March 29. The new arrangement seems to be work- 
ing well. 
The visitation of the schools of the State has been continued, 
with gratifying results. The list of accredited schools has been 
sifted and enlarged, with the result that the preparation of the 
students entering the Academie Department has been decidedly 
improved. One result of this visitation of schools has been the
-P-A-G-E-238
— 223. 
organization of an Appointment Committee from the Faculty 
of the University for the purpose of obtaining positions for stu- 
dents and alumni in publia and private schools. This com- 
mittee has already located nearly all the worthy and available 
students secking such positions. It notifies school directors and 
principals desiring teachers to correspond with it, addressing the 
Appointment Committee, University of Tennessee. 
Under an order of the Board of Trustees, a system of Farmers’ 
Institutes was projected last winter by the officers of the Agri- 
eultural Department and the Experiment Station, and Insti- 
tutes were held at ten different places throughout the State. 
After the Legislature made an appropriation to the Commis- 
sioner of Agriculture for the purpose of conducting Institutes, 
the leadership in this matter was turned over to him. He has 
invited the professors of the Agricultural Department and offi- 
cers of the Experiment Station to assist him in holding these 
Institutes. They are being held with regularity, and, it is be- 
lieved, with great benefit to the people. 
Great improvements have been made during the year upon the: 
Experiment Station farm. The old buildings have all been re- 
paired and put in order, a model road has been built from the 
pike to the farm buildings, and all of the buildings and inclosures 
have been put in excellent condition. A new professor of agri- 
culture and a professor of horticulture and forestry have been” 
elected and have entered upon their duties. An expert for plot 
work and a dairyman have been added to the staff of the Experi- 
ment Station. The Experiment Station and the Agricultural 
Department are growing steadily. ; 
A short course in agriculture for farmers, dairymen, stock- 
men, and fruit growers has been announced for the second term 
—January 4 to March 28, 1900. This is a new movement on 
the part of the University, and merits special notice. The Uni- 
versity has provided a fine equipment for giving this course, in- 
cluding fifteen instructors in agriculture and related sciences, 
six laboratories, farm and experimental grounds of one hundred 
and five acr es, horticultural grounds of forty acres, experimental 
roads, one hundred and sixty-eight test plots, and an agricultural
-P-A-G-E-239
—224— 
library of over two thousand volumes, all of which will be free 
for the use of students. No entrance examination is required, 
and tuition is free. The object of this course is to present in a — 
practical way the results of scientific investigations, to educate 
students, dairymen, stockmen, and farm superintendents. It 
is desired also to bring the farmers of the State in touch with 
the Agricultural Department and the Experiment Station, and 
to inculeate habits of study and research among them. Three 
lectures will be given each morning, many of them illustrated 
by stereopticon views. Practical demonstrations will oceupy 
two hours or more every afternoon. The course will include 
lectures on breeds of live stock—their origin, formation, his- 
tory, and management; breeding live stock—heredity, in-and-in - 
breeding, conformation, etc.; feeding live stock—digestibility — 
of food stuffs, rations, ete. ; exercises with the score card in judg- 
ing live stock; lectures on dairying—care and handling of milk, 
milk testing, butter making, ete.; lectures on farm management 
—-soils, grasses, rotation of crops, and experimental work; soil 
physics and seed selection; farm bookkeeping and accounts; 
road construction; agricultural chemistry—soils, fertilizers, and 
liming; the weather in its relation to crops; plant physiology 
and plant diseases; horticulture and entomology; truck farm- 
ing; injurious insects, and remedies for the same; pruning and 
. grafting, ete. i 
A series of valuable bulletins have been published during the 
year bearing upon grasses and forage plants. Another bulletin 
treated of cultivated persimmons. Press bulletins have been 
issued upon the following subjects: “ The Value of Leguminous 
Plants,” “Homemade Fertilizers,” ‘“ Farmers’ Institutes,” 
“ How the Experiment Station Can Help the Farmers,” “ The - 
East Tennessee Farmers’ Convention and Farmers’ Institute,” 
“Sheep Husbandry,” “ The Saving of Soil Moisture,” “ Farm- 
ers’ Institute at Boon’s Creek,” “ Liming Soils,” “ Farmers’ 
Institute at Rogersville,” “The Fertilizer Question,” “ Cow 
Pea Vine Hay,” “A Short Course in Agriculture.” These have 
been greatly sought and highly appreciated by the people.

TENNESSEE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL. 
Sir: I have the honor to present to you this report of our 
work. During the past two years we have been exceedingly 
fortunate in many respects. The health of the children has 
been fairly good, and their advancement along every line has 
been progressive and in keeping with the growth and develop- 
ment of this institution. 
We have received since opening, 1,994 pupils. Of this num- 
ber, 1,518 were white boys, 340 girls, and 136 colored boys. 
We have discharged 1,249. Of this number, 1,046 were white 
boys, 130 girls, and 73 colored boys. On December 19, 1898, 
there were remaining in the school 745 pupils. Of this number, 
472 were white boys, 210 girls, and 63 colored boys. Out of 
this number, we had 162 pay pupils; 100 of these were paid 
for by Davidson County, and 62 were paid for by parents or 
guardians. Deducting the pay pupils, it leaves us with 583 
State pupils. We have a constant pressure brought on the in- 
stitution by persons from other States making application for 
admission of pupils. Occasionally we accept those who seem 
to be making trouble for their friends or relatives, but only 
when we have the room necessary to accommodate them. We 
turn away from our doors not less than twenty-five pupils a 
month. This is sometimes done because the counties are not 
entitled to more than they have here at.the time the application 
is made, but oftener from other States than Tennessee. 
During the two years we have spent on subsistence account, 
$127,446.13; on furnishing account, $8,717.02; and on im- 
provements and repairs, $19,240.51. We have also paid out the 
special appropriation of $5,000 made for the erection of a new 
building for the small boys, and also the special appropriation 
of $2,000 made for the purpose of paying off outstanding notes 
for insurance. During the past two years we have expended 
for necessary improvements and repairs, for which no special 
15
-P-A-G-E-241
—226— 
appropriations were made, $19,240.51, and have an indebted- 
ness remaining of $4,472. 
These special improvements made during the two years for 
which this money has been paid are two workshops at the Girls’ 
Department, 16x36 feet; two rooms and porch at the Small 
Girls’ Building, 17x29 feet; an addition to the cabinet shop, 
21x52 feet; workshop, two stories high, 26x54 feet; an addition 
to the laundry, 15x24 feet; stable for twenty-three head of stock, 
18x92 feet ; shed for farming implements, 12x89 feet; 619 pan- 
els of fence, and lightning rods for the main building. We have 
put in a gas plant, which furnishes gas for the Girls’ Depart- 
ment and the Auditorium; have built plank walks to the differ- 
ent departments, also band stands; and have built sixteen brick 
flower beds on the east side of the yard, put in appliances for 
steam cooking, and fitted up two new shops for manual training 
and fresco painting. We have also fitted up a cellar under the 
barn, formerly used as a stable, for vegetables. This we found 
necessary because of the need for more storerooms at the main 
building. We have also put in electric lights at the main build- 
ing. This was done in order to make our present gas supply 
sufficient for the Small Boys’ Department and the main build- 
ing after the electric lights were turned out. It was necessary 
either to increase the gas supply or put in electric lights, and the 
cost. was about equal. All the buildings and the roofs of the 
buildings have been painted, and everything along the line of 
repairs has been done in a most substantial manner. 
During the past season the farm has not been overly pro- 
ductive, especially in late crops, on account of drought. How- 
ever, we have had sufficient vegetables for home consumption, 
and have sold $740.02 worth of produce. We have rented 
about 250 acres of land for pasturage and corn, and have raised 
a quantity of pea hay, which has proven satisfactory forage. 
We have 17 good mules, 13 horses, and 50 cows. We find that 
we can rent the land and supply our milk and butter cheaper and 
better than to buy them elsewhere. 
Our shops and all that pertains to the education of the chil-
-P-A-G-E-242
dren along the line of manual training have been, to us, entirely 
satisfactory. The children have been interested in all the vari- 
ous duties they have been called upon to perform. They have 
been engaged in the following trades and industries: Book- 
keeping, shorthand, typewriting, telegraphy, printing, cabinet 
making, carpentry, wood carving, furniture finishing, manual 
training, mattress making, upholstering, painting, barber shop, 
broom making, tailoring, blacksmithing, wagon making, bread 
baking, harness making, shoemaking, store keeping, steam laun- 
dering, machine shops, boilers, plumbing, farming, vegetable 
gardening, fruit gardening; work in greenhouses, hotbeds, vine- 
yards, barn; and care of stock. Their advancement along these 
lines has been marked. . They raise all our vegetables; manu- 
facture all our furniture; make all of our shoes, mattresses, 
clothing, and wagons; do all our carpentering and a greater 
part of the plumbing and repairing necessary at the institution. 
They are capable of making anything that is to be made in these 
branches. This proves a matter of great economy and saving 
to the State, as well as a source of great benefit to the children 
in the way of instruction. This past fall we have erected mag- 
nificent double greenhouses, with latest improved hot-water heat- 
ing appliances, which have been filled with a choice selection of 
plants and cuttings. We have reorganized and strengthened 
our floral class, and are now going into the work on a much larger 
seale. 
We have employed at the present time a corps of sixty teach- 
ers and employees, the greater part of whom at one time were 
pupils of this school, and who, by diligence and perseverance, 
have fitted themselves for the positions which they now fill. We 
find that more satisfactory results can be obtained by employing 
- our former pupils than by securing outside assistance. They 
are gentler and understand more thoroughly our established 
methods of dealing with the children, to say nothing of their de- 
sire for that perfect system and order which had become so 
thoroughly instilled into their natures and dispositions during 
their attendance as pupils here.
-P-A-G-E-243

We wish to call attention to the fact that E. H. Doak, recently ~ 
appointed to the superintendency of the newly established Ken- 
tucky Industrial School, was for a number of years connected 
with this institution as the Superintendent’s first assistant, dur- 
ing which time he filled the position in a very creditable man- 
ner; also that Messrs. J. L. Price and J. L. Kalleen, Superin- 
tendents of the Knox County and Hamilton County Industrial 
Schools, respectively, were associated with us in the same ca- 
pacity; and that many other of our formerly employed assist- 
ants and pupils are now filling positions of trust and honor, not 
only throughout this State, but in various other States of the 
Union as well. 
In the pursuance of their literary branches, the children have 
also given very satisfactory results, their deportment there, 
as elsewhere, having been very exemplary. We have two ses- 
sions of school daily. One-half of the children attend school 
during the forenoon, and are employed in the various workshops 
during the afternoon. Those who attend school during the 
afternoon are engaged in work at the time of the morning ses- 
sion. In this way each child is placed under the direct, manage- 
ment, influence, and control of lady teachers for about five hours 
each day, as only lady teachers are employed in the literary de- 
partments. 
Our musical department compares favorably with that of any 
institution of this character in the country. We have a brass” 
band of about twenty-six members—acknowledgedly the best in 
the State—whose musical renditions are remarkably good for 
boys of their ages. They play with credit music of the very 
best class, which they read and execute at sight. They devote 
several hours each day to this study, under the direct supervision 
of a competent teacher who is employed solely for that purpose. — 
We also have classes in vocal music at each of our several de- 
partments, overseen and directed by the matron and competent 
assistants. 
We have good reasons to be thankful because of 'the continual — 
good will and kindly affection of the people of the State of Ten-
-P-A-G-E-244
— 229 — 
nessee toward this institution. We are known throughout the 
State as one of its best institutions, and throughout the country 
at large we have a recognized leadership in all that pertains to 
_ the management of such an institution. 
To our good and substantial friends, Col. and Mrs. E. W. 
Cele, we owe very much. Their hands and hearts have always 
been outstretched toward us in every time of need. The Anna 
Russell Cole Auditorium, erected and furnished by them and 
presented to the children of the Tennessee Industrial School, 
touches our hearts with ever-conscious gratitude. 
W. C. KILVINGTON, Superintendent. 
TENNESSEE SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND. 
Sir: The education of the blind has occupied the minds of 
thoughtful men for more than a hundred years. In almost 
every period of the world’s history mention has been made of 
blind men famous in letters, philosophy, mathematics, and po- 
etry. But they were men of genius—men who overcame any 
and all difficulties, and who, by their intellectual power, sur- 
mounted obstacles too formidable for any but the most gifted 
to attempt. Their achievements have placed their names high 
upon the roll of the renowned and of the benefactors of man- 
kind. The blind bard of Attica scaled the heights of Olympus, 
and his master hand swept the lyre whose melodious chords re- 
verberate down the ages, filling the world with poetry and song. 
He sung of love and war, of mighty deeds and godlike men who 
battled with and overcame the dread Titanic power—the enemy 
and enslaver of our race in the world’s young days: History 
tells us that Cicero was the foremost orator in the Augustan era. 
His matchless eloquence swayed the Roman Senate, and, through 
__ it, the world, and made the history of his time. His orations 
   are still regarded as creations of elegance and power, and are
-P-A-G-E-245
— 230 — 
the admiration of every student of the learning of those bygone 
days. But we never hear of Diodorus, the blind Greek slave © 
who taught and trained him—a man who, by hereditary tastes 
and tendencies, was his superior and master. Nicholas Saun- 
derson, the blind mathematician, was thought worthy by the 
Lord Commissioners of Oxford to wear the mantle of Sir Isaac 
Newton. He wore it with distinction and honor. The world 
knows that “ Paradise Lost,” the immortal work of Milton, was 
the child of his days of darkness and of sorrow. The beauteous 
forms, the enchanting landscapes, and the majestic thought were 
the offspring of a mind seldom equaled in grandeur and never 
surpassed in sweetness. 
But the ordinary, the mediocre, mind must be gently led 
along the pleasant paths of knowledge. The first step then 
was to invent tangible letters whereby the blind might be taught 
to read. To the philanthropist, Abbe Haiiy, belongs the honor 
of this invention, in 1784. A school was established and some 
progress made; but the Revolution of 1792 put a stop to the 
good work in France for some years. The fact that tangible let- 
ters had been invented and the blind taught to read was pub- 
lished throughout Europe, and attempts were made in a number 
of places to establish schools for the blind, but with little success. 
The Bible is primarily the causé of the existence of schools 
for the blind. The great reverence and esteem in which the 
Bible was held by the good people of England and America, and 
the belief that the Scriptures should be placed in the hands of 
every one, led to the establishing of schools, the invention of 
numberless alphabets and intricate appliances, most of which 
have fallen into disuse. The schools, however, partook more of 
the nature of an asylum than of a place of learning. They were 
supported by private charity. A little reading and a few 
branches of handicraft were taught, but nothing more. To this 
country belongs the credit of placing these institutions upon a 
true basis and of laying down the lines along which the educa- 
tion of the blind should be prosecuted. By one of our funda- 
mental laws and by the doctrine of individual right, the State
-P-A-G-E-246
ol 
is obligated to provide opportunities and facilities for every 
child in the State to acquire an education. As the appliances 
used in the ordinary school cannot be used in the instruction of 
the blind, and as the progress of the seeing children would be 
greatly retarded in some branches, it was, therefore, found ad- 
visable, and in every way beneficial, to provide schools particu- 
larly adapted to the wants of the blind, thus making them part 
of the educational system of the State. If, therefore, every 
child in the State can demand an education of the State, then 
blind children have the same right, and cannot be classed with 
paupers; nor can their schools be called “ asylums” any more 
than the city schools, the Peabody Normal, or the State Uni- 
versity. 
A great deal has been written and said upon the way the blind 
should be taught, and a score or more of theories and methods 
have been presented and strongly advocated by their inventors 
or originators; but the foremost educators of the blind at the 
present time occupy a common ground and are united in these 
particulars: Let the blind be taught the branches taught in our 
best schools and colleges ; let schools for the blind be preparatory 
schools, fitting their students for the university or for the strug- 
gle of life in whatever field their lot may be cast. Text-books 
adopted by our best. seminaries, we use; the forms and systems 
which have stood the test of time and experience, we use. 
_ The only difference between this and the ordinary school is in 
our methods and appliances. The blackboard, with its count- 
less resources, has no place with us; while pictures, drawings, 
and charts, indispensable in the ordinary schoo] for description 
and illustration, are of no service to us; and the infinite variety 
of light, shade, and color forms no part of our equipment. The 
seeing child, from observation, learns very much. The green, 
waving grass; the bronzed autumnal leaves, the fleecy cloud, the 
shimmering light, the sun, the moon, the stars, and all that make 
external Nature bright, lie open before him; while manners, de- 
portment, and all external graces are his by imitation. But of 
these the blind child perceives nothing; all must be taught him ;
-P-A-G-E-247
— 232 — 
  and the teacher becomes a substitute, not merely for the text 
book, but must be able to impart, so far as possible, his knowl- 
edge of the visible world. As this implies individual teaching _ 
to a great extent, hence our need for more teachers than is re- 
quired in the ordinary school. ; 
We have but a comparatively small number of appliances. 
adapted to the sense of touch; yet, in spite of these obstacles 
and hindrances in practical teaching, much has been accom- 
plished. Every subject taught has been so thoroughly explained. 
and elucidated that it cannot fail to be comprehended by the 
pupil. Had we the means, many things might be purchased — 
that would aid and facilitate our work, make simpler and more 
direct the information we wish to impart about tangible bodies— _ 
‘such as a manikin, by which the eye, the ear, and other organs of 
the body would be greatly enlarged for the class in Physiology; 
specimens of minerals, ores, rocks, quartz, crystals, corals, shells, 
ete., in Geology; animals of all kinds in wood, rubber, and 
metal; birds, stuffed and mounted; cubes, globes, and all sorts 
of geometrical figures. These thines, as far as possible, should 
be procured and placed in the hands of our pupils; for, without 
them, mere description conveys but a vague idea of the animal 
or bird, and sometimes the impression made is very erroneous 
and can only be removed by the actual examination of the ani- 
mal or bird itself. 
Another year has been added to the history of the school—a 
year fraught with hopes and fears, full of events of the utmost 
importance to the country. New thoughts, new impulses, fill 
the nation’s mind; new channels are found for trade, for adven- 
ture, and for enterprise. Every successful war creates great 
activity in all branches of industry and along every line of 
thought. Seminaries and colleges have felt. the influence, and 
doubtless the growth and success of this institution may be, in 
part, due to the same awakening spirit. For the most part, the 
history of an individual is commonplace, uneventful, and sel- 
- dom, if at all, interesting; but the school, the community, or the 
State has a part to play in the presence of other schools, com-
-P-A-G-E-248
— 233-— 
munities, or States. If that part be well played, the school, 
community, or State will receive the applause it merits; but if 
poorly played, it will receive the condemnation it deserves. 
Motion is the law of Nature; nothing can remain stationary; 
there must be progression or retrogression. As the State or 
community becomes wealthy and powerful by commerce, by 
enterprise, and by integrity, so must also the school become 
a power for good by enterprise, by integrity, by adopting the 
best known methods, and by keeping fully abreast of the most 
advanced thought of the day. As the nation stamps upon its 
“citizens the nation’s characteristics, so also the school will place 
its impress upon its pupils for industry, frugality, morality, a 
true sense of honor, faithfulness and politeness, and for being 
ever mindful of the rights of others.. These qualities make the 
true gentleman and will pass current anywhere. The buttoon 
or the boor may be tolerated, but the gentleman is always re- 
spected. 
In this year was completed and published the “ History and 
Prospectus” of the school Over 2,000 copies have been dis-— 
tributed among the people throughout the State. The favorable 
comments of the press and the large number of eulogistic letters 
which I have received show that the little hook was well received 
and has accomplished all that we hoped for from its publication. 
The biennial report of the Trustees and the Superintendent 
to the Fifty-first General Assembly fully deseribes the condi- 
tion and needs of the school, and sets forth the advancement 
made in all its departments. The elevation of the moral tone, 
the absence of discord and insubordination, the amicable rela- 
tions existing between pupils and teachers, and the interest 
(amounting to enthusiasm) that has been aroused among the 
pupils for their work, prove the conscientious, faithful, and in- 
- telligent discharge of duty on the part of the Faculty. 
The graduates of the school, I am proud to say, have been 
very successful. They are noted for sobriety, for industy 
_ for honorable conduct. Wherever they engage in business of 
any kind, they soon win the confidence and patronage of the    ry, and 
   
 
-P-A-G-E-249
— 234— 
public. They do not appeal to the sympathy of the people for 
employment or assistance, but place their claim for recognition 
upon a much higher ground: they only ask to be allowed to com- 
pete with the seeing in the business or profession for which they 
are fitted, without favor and without prejudice, fully confident 
that the test will result in their favor. In order that the blind 
may successfully compete with the seeing, the education of the 
blind must be superior to that of the seeing, so as to counter- 
balance the want of the greatest of all blessings—the want of 
sight. Ifa blind man seeks employment as a teacher of music, 
his knowledge of the science must be far broader than that of 
his competitor, so that adverse criticism will not be even dared. 
He must be able to demonstrate by execution, by technique, by 
skill, and by his familiarity with the great masters and his 
ability to interpret their best works, that he is the peer of the 
foremost man in his profession. The same may be said of teach- - 
ers in literature, of merchants, and, indeed, of every pursuit in 
which the blind may be engaged. The earlier the training of 
the child begins, the surer will be the success ; for while the brain 
is in the plastic state, the more impressionable will be the mind, 
the character is formed, good habits are inculeated, and the de- 
velopment of the child begins in a reasonable, sensible way. 
There will be no false steps to retrace and no bad habits to cor- 
rect. 
The most successful and progressive schools for the blind in 
this country, and also in Europe, have long since adopted the 
kindergarten, and have found it, if possible, more beneficial to 
the blind than to the seeing. Some blind children, from neg- 
lect of ignorant, selfish parents, on the one hand, and some from 
ceaseless attention of overly fond, foolish parents, on the other 
hand, remain undeveloped in mind and body, feeble and help- 
less; while others, having no one to instruct them, fall into odd 
ways and contract disagreeable, and sometimes repulsive, hab- 
its; and should these children reach the age of twelve years 
before they are sent to school, it will be almost impossible to 
undo the effect of such pernicious and cruel treatment, or to
-P-A-G-E-250
98h 
eradicate habits so long practiced that they have become a part 
of the child’s nature. It is just here that. the kindergarten exer- 
cises such beneficent influences, for there are no idiosyncrasies 
encountered in the young that are not corrected or conquered by 
this excellent system. “ Kindergarten training does not mean 
simply playing under the supervision of a teacher ; it takes chil- 
dren at the most impressionable age and places them in a school 
fashioned after Nature’s school. It cultivates hand, head, and 
heart, and so prepares the way for the pursuits that are to fol- 
lew. While the kindergarten should not be considered merely 
as a place in which to prepare children for school work, the fact 
that it does so prepare them is none the less patent.” 
Have you ever tried to realize what it means to be blind—to 
grope your way with hesitating, uncertain step; to be led from 
place to place, an object of pity, sometimes aversion; excluded 
from most of the pleasures and joys of life, made to feel your 
dependence, often told that you are a burden? Can you con- 
ceive what a great deprivation it must be to the child who has _ 
never beheld the face of his loving mother—never gazed into 
the depths of those wistful, tender eyes, nor seen the angelic 
sinile, the radiant form, always present, never weary; a guard- 
ian angel,.a very providence; a face glowing with love divine, 
beaming with hope and pride and joy, ever trustful, ever pa- 
tient, showing in every look and glance the mother’s heart, the 
mother’s love? All this to us is a priceless memory filling our 
hearts like a benediction from on high; but to the blind child it 
is a sealed book. He hears the gentle voice; feels the touch of 
the soft, caressing hand; and often wonders why the half-sup- 
pressed sob from a mother’s breaking heart for her poor and 
blighted child. Imagine for a moment that the sun, moon, and 
stars are blotted from the heavens and that we are surrounded 
by intense darkness; Death’s black pall presses us on every side. 
In vain we strain our aching eyes to catch one gleam of light; 
the bright and glorious sky, the lovely landscape, the rolling 
plain, the leafy wood, the cloud-capped mountains, the gorgeous 
sunset—all have disappeared. We are, as it were, imprisoned
-P-A-G-E-251
  — 236 — 
in a dungeon without one ray of light to pierce the gloom. This — 
profound darkness, this dungeon, is the blind child’s home; it 
is always with him; he cannot flee from it; it accompanies him 
wherever he goes; it is ever present, like a curse; the walls of 
his prison are just beyond his reach; nothing that he can do ean 
free him from this soul-crushing, this intolerable, night. In 
the beginning God said: ‘‘ Let there be light; and there was 
light.” Let us give to the blind the lig] Tt will

mind; it will soften and purify the he

of whom were neglected 
and helpless, timid, shy, and despondent, exciting the sympathy 
of all who beheld them; and how, in a few short weeks, these 
same children with buoyant step were hurrying to their classes, 
their cheery voices and merry laugh ringing through the halls 
and corridors ; and when they left us, educated men and women, 
well equipped for the struggle of life, bearing with them hope 
and courage, and feeling that they, too, had a part to play in the 
world’s great drama, I cannot but feel profoundly grateful to 
Almighty God for the good already done; and I trust erelong 
that every blind child in the State will have his sorrow turned 
to gladness, his darkness to light, and ignorance and mendicaney 
he replaced by intelligence and manly dependence. :   
The curriculum is much the same as that of last year. In 
addition to the regular lessons, I required that the pupils learn 
to spell and define five words each day. This interferes very lit- 
tle with the regular studies and increases wonderfully the child’s — 
vocabulary. I also required recitations to be taught in every
-P-A-G-E-252
  ae o 
class, and these recitations to be spoken before the entire school 
at stated periods. This has had an excellent result in pronun- 
ciation, enunciation, and in speaking audibly; it also increases 
their stock of words; besides, it strengthens their memory, gives 
to thought expressions and forms that will be remembered as long 
as life lasts. We can all recall the pieces and hymns we learned 
in childhood. How much we owe to those simple pieces it is 
impossible to tell, but doubtless much more than we are aware 
of. Number of pieces memorized by pupils during the session, 
225. 
The following is our curriculum: Spelling, Reading, Lan- 
- guage Lessons, Grammar, Etymology, Rhetoric, Literature, 
Latin, Practical Arithmetic, Mental Arithmetic, Algebra, Geom- 
2 ery (Plane and Solid), Geography, Ancient and Modern His- 
tory, Physiology, Psychology, Civil Government, Philosophy, 
and Object Lessons. ~ 
_ To encourage and create a love for reading, I organized four 
classes according to the advancement of the several pupils, and. 
offered two prizes in each class for attention and for a fair 
knowledge of the book read. As each book was finished, the 
class was examined upon it and marked accordingly. I found 
that this worked admirably and my object was fully attained, 
_ which was proved by the great interest manifested and the good 
order and attention invariably observed in the classes. The 
books selected treat of travels, history, biography, and of current 
literature as yet not in raised print. i 
Our plan for holding examinations is much the same as that 
of schools for the seeing. At the end of each month, the month’s. ~ 
work is reviewed; at the end of each quarter, three days are 
spent in review and two days in examination. The final ex- 
amination takes place at the end of the session, when the ground’ 
gone over during the year is reviewed, and the pupils are marked 
according to their understanding of the subject studied, for at- 
tention, and for promptness in class. The younger children 
and beginners are examined orally; this cultivates attention, 
— quickness of thought, and alertness—qualities which, when well
-P-A-G-E-253

developed, enable the student to master with more ease studies 
encountered in subsequent school work. For the more ad- 
vanced classes, a written examination is preferable; it gives 
time for deliberation and careful thought, and puts the pupils 
on a more equal footing; and, in some measure, it does away 
with the trepidation and excitement so often observed on such 
occasions. When examinations yield a very high per cent, it 
argues that the pupils are very proficient or that the examina- 
tion is very easy ; when, on the other hand, the percentage is low, 
it argues that the pupils are either very dull or the examinations 
very rigid. I endeavor to avoid these extremes and to give as 
conservative an examination as possible. The line of promotion 
~ is 65 per cent, and all who attain 80 per cent are placed on the 
Roll of Honor; this gives an additional incentive to work and 
study. The names of those falling below 65 per cent, as well 
as those on the Roll of Honor, are read before the Board, which, 
I think, has a salutary effect, arousing pride and a determina- 
tion to hold as high a place as possible inthe estimation of their 
schoolfellows and teachers.

Unlike other schools, this institution embraces three depart- 
ments—viz.: Literary, Musical, and Mechanical. 
As music is the most profitable employment for the blind, 
every child who enters the school is required to devote a con- 
siderable part of the time to this study. Our fifteen pianos are 
in constant use from 8 o’clock in the morning until 8 o’clock at 
night, and the deep tones of the great organ reverberate through 
the house almost every hour of the day. Our band, composed ~
-P-A-G-E-254
od 
of boys ranging from ten to twenty years of age, is equal in accu- 
racy and precision to many bands consisting entirely of grown 
men. 
Number of pupils enrolled in Musical Department: Singing, 
advanced class, 55; junior class, 74; Piano, 110; Organ, 7; 
Band, 22. 
In schools for the blind, manual training forms a very impor- 
tant department of their educational system. Unfortunately, 
there are but few branches of industry in which the blind can 
hope successfully to compete with the seeing, and those are not 
at all intricate or very remunerative; but as a large per cent 
of the students of these schools cannot be qualified to teach either 
literature or music, they must be made proficient in some branch 
of handicraft by which they will be able to make their bread. 
There is, however, another feature connected with this which is 
of great importance to every child, but especially to the blind 
child. The hand must be trained to use tools with skill and 
dexterity ; for although the boy or girl may never be compelled 
to follow these employments as a means of livelihood, yet they 
may prove very serviceable in time of need. 
Girls are taught to sew by hand, to manage a sewing machine, 
to cut and fit dresses, bead work, hammock making, knitting, 
and crocheting ; while the boys are taught piano tuning, mattress 
making, broom making, and chair caning. 
Number of articles made in the workshop during the session 
of 1898-99: Brooms, 1,228; chairs, 60; mattresses, 22. Total,

The Tennessee School for the Blind is situated in the city of
-P-A-G-E-255
— 240 — 
  Nashville, on the west bank of the Cumberland River, amidst — 
beautiful, spacious, and well-kept grounds. It contains one hun- 
dred rooms, and is heated by steam, lighted by gas, and, in short, 
has all the appliances and conveniences of a first-class boarding 
school. There are no open fireplaces, no grates nor stoves, and 
when candles are used by teachers or servants they are placed 
in lanterns. There is both a day watchman and a night watch- 
man, and eyery possible precaution is taken for the safety of the 
building and the inmates. 3 
This property was purchased by Judge John M. Lea, for 
which he paid $15,000, and in the same year (1872) he donated 
it to the school. The original building has been altered and 
greatly enlarged so as to meet the requirements of the institu- 
tion, costing about $80,000. The last General Assembly appro- 
priated $15,000 to erect a building to contain workshops, gym- 
nasium, boiler room, etc. The building has been completed, 
and is a plain, massive, substantial structure of three stories, 
standing upon the bluff one hundred and fifty feet in the rear 
of the main building. 
Owing to the dilapidated condition of the house occupied by 
the colored blind, the T'rustees were compelled either to. spend — 
a large sum of money in repairing the old house or to buy an- 
other better adapted to school purposes. The latter alternative 
was adopted, and the residence of the late Hon. John Trimble 
was purchased. It is about one mile south of the school proper, 
upon the highest point in that part of the city; it is heated by 
hot water, and will accommodate fifty children. 
The value of buildings and grounds of the Tennessee School 
for the Blind is $125,000. The library contains 2,000 volumes — 
in raised letters and 600 volumes in ink print. In addition to 
‘tuition, pupils receive board, washing, and medical attendance 
free. Parents and guardians are only required to. pay traveling 
expenses and furnish suitable clothing. Every child, on enter- 
ing school, is vaccinated, and a thorough examination of the 
visual organ is made under the direction of the school physician. 
Tf it is deemed possible to restore or even improve the sight, an
-P-A-G-E-256

operation is made, which in many instances has proven very ; 
beneficial. For particulars, see subjoined report of Dr. Cain: 
“ Nasuvitiz, Tenn., June 10, 1899. 
“Prof. J. V. Armstrong, Superintendent Tennessee School for 
the Blind. 
“Dear Sir: I herewith submit my report as physician to the 
Tennessee School for the Blind for the past scholastic year. 
“ The careful investigation during the past session rendered 
special treatment of the eyes of the pupils largely unnecessary, 
except in the newcomers. All operable cases were treated by 
‘Dr. Hilliard Wood, who has kindly rendered efficient service in 
that department, and much permanent benefit has resulted to 
" several of the unfortunate sufferers. 
“ With a considerably larger attendance than on the preceding 
year, the amount of sickness was less. There were no outbreaks 
of any special disease during the year, except a few severe cases 
of pneumonia, aggravated and probably excited by the insuffi- 
cient heat of the building during the intense cold spell in Janu- 
ary. The only fatal casualty, to a most estimable pupil, oc- 
curred during that outbreak. No accidents or injuries hap- 
pened during the year, which speaks well for the orderly man- 
_ agement of so many of this unfortunate class of pupils. There 
was practically no sickness among the pupils during the latter 
months of the session, and through the whole year the amount of 
sickness will compare most favorably with the same number of 
pupils anywhere. All pupils were vaccinated during the year. 
_Ican but congratulate you, Professor, on the successful manage- 
ment of the school during the past year. 
“ Respectfully submitted, 
“J. 8. CAIN, M.D.”

TENNESSEE DEAF AND DUMB SCHOOL. 
Sir: In behalf of the Tennessee Deaf and Dumb School, lo- 
cated at Knoxville, I have the honor and pleasure to report the 
completion of a successful, and in many respects a very satis- 
factory, scholastic year for the session of 1898-99, and the auspi- 
cious beginning of the session of 1899-1900. 
Appreciating the privilege of being able, through your report, 
to bring this school before the great body of the.teachers of Ten- 
nessee, I beg to be indulged in a brief statement of the history 
and purposes of the school in connection with a report of the 
workings of this branch of the educational interests of our State. 
The Tennessee Deaf and Dumb School was established by the 
Legislature of the State in 1844, through the special efforts of 
Senator John Cocke, of Grainger County, whose interest in the 
education of the deaf and dumb had been awakened by there 
being quite a number of deaf mutes in his county who were 
growing up in ignorance, and for whom there could come none 
of the blessings of education, except through the establishment 
of a special school for deaf mutes. 
Senator Cocke made common cause with the friends of the 
blind, and the result of their united efforts was the simultaneous 
establishment of the Tennessee School for the Blind, at Nash- 
ville, and the Tennessee Deaf and Dumb School, at Knoxville— 
twin monuments of honor to perpetuate the God-given wisdom 
and philanthropy of the Legislators of that day; and since that 
time the proper maintenance of these schools has ever been the 
just pride of the State. 
This school was opened in 1845 with six pupils, the first ses- 
sion closing with nine pupils in attendance. The only suspen- 
sion of the school was from 1861 to 1866, on account of the Civil 
War. < 
The main school, which is for white pupils, is situated almost 
in the heart of the present city of Knoxville, the grounds con- 
taining eight acres. This department has good and convenient
-P-A-G-E-258
240s 
buildings provided by the generosity of the State, and beautiful 
grounds with well-kept lawns, shade trees, and playgrounds. 
It is the frequent comment of visitors that the school premises 
are nowhere excelled for beauty and adaptability to the purposes 
for which they are used. 
Commodious and comfortable quarters for colored pupils are 
situated two miles east of Knoxville, upon a tract of twenty- 
seven acres of land bought for this purpose in 1885. This de- 
partment was opened in rented premises in 1881. It is under 
the same general management as the main school in the city, but 
is otherwise entirely separate in its operation. 
There seems to exist in some minds a mistaken idea of the 
purpose and work of this school, many assuming that it is chiefly 
a place for the care of helpless deaf mutes—a custodial institu- 
tion. Such is not its purpose. It is a school for the develop- 
ment of the minds and bodies and for the moral training of the 
children of Tennessee who, by reason of the affliction of dea- 
ness, are cut off from the privilege of receiving these advantages 
in the public schools of the State, and hence require special train- 
ing and special instruction. Its chief purpose is education, and 
its founders wisely declared this in giving it the name “ Tennes- 
see School.” Its constant aim is to fit its pupils to be intelli- 
gent, industrious, moral, self-supporting, and helpful citizens of 
the Commonwealth; and it is manifestly to the interest of the 
State, as well as in conformity to the dictates of humanity, that 
every deaf child in the State, capable of receiving an education, 
should have the advantages of the school. While the manage- 
ment makes constant effort to secure this end, and while the in- 
fluence of the school is constantly extending, it is a lamentable 
fact that many deaf mutes in Tennessee are growing up in pitia- 
_ ble ignorance; for an uneducated deaf mute is one of the most 
pitiable of human beings. 
Perhaps there is no class of persons in the State who can do 
more to remedy this unfortunate condition of affairs than the 
teachers of the public schools. 
I beg to ask here that the teachers throughout the State will,
-P-A-G-E-259
— 244 — 
as they come in contact with or hear of a deaf child, drop a card 
to the school at Knoxville, giving approximate age of child and 
name and residence of parent or guardian. There are a num- 
ber of teachers in the State who follow this plan, with very 
happy results. 
Particulars in regard to the admission of pupils will be fur- 
nished by the Principal on application. 
In all instruction the great necessity and the great difficulty 
in teaching a deaf child is to give him language, that he may 
express his thoughts and that he may receive the thoughts of 
others—the language which a hearing child learns in early — 
childhood. Such acquired language is to the deaf child the 
indispensable key to progress and knowledge. While giving 
him this he may readily acquire a good, general, common-school 
education in most of the branches taught in the publie schools, 
and in this work the text-books recently adopted by the State 
are used in this school. 
Physical culture in a well-equipped gymnasium, under a spe- 
cial teacher, forms an important feature of daily school work. 
This work was systematically begun about six years ago. Its 
benefits are constantly manifest. 
Printing, shoemaking, and carpentry are taught: the boys, 
who also assist in the care of stock and in general work on the 
premises. The girls learn housework, plain and faney sewing, 
embroidery, ete. 
An exhibit of the products of the Industrial Departments, 
with schoolroom papers, drawings, etce., was awarded a medal 
and diploma at the Tennessee Centennial Exposition in 1897, 
in competition with much work of like character from schools 
for the hearing. 
A special feature of the school is oral instruction, by means 
of which the speech of those who lost their hearing after begin- 
ning to talk is preserved and improved, and by which many chil- 
dren born deaf are taught to speak quite intelligibly. Through 
oral teaching, also, many pupils become quite proficient in read- 
ing the lips, and are thus put in closer touch with the speaking 
world about them.
-P-A-G-E-260
— 246 — 
In manual instruction, much use is made of the single-hand 
manual alphabet for practice in language. 
During the two sessions under consideration all the counties 
in the State, with nine exceptions, have been represented in the 
school by pupils in attendance. The total enrollment for the 
two sessions has been 292; the average attendance has been 215. 
The present attendance is 228. 
A well-arranged brick building for hospital purposes is now 
being erected. The need of such a building was recognized by 
the present General Assembly of the State at its recent session, 
and an appropriation of $5,000 was made therefor. 
Besides being an inestimable boon to the deaf and dumb, the 
work of their education has undoubtedly had beneficial influence 
upon general educational work and methods. The very necessi- 
ties of the situation long ago made schools for the deaf and 
dumb pioneers in this country in the employment of means and 
methods more recently regarded as belonging to advanced sys- 
tems in connection with schools for hearing children. Object 
teaching and picture teaching have always constituted an im- 
portant part in the work of instructing the deaf and dumb. 
Their teachers have long recognized the value of sight reading 
and have known of the accuracy, in the matter of spelling, that 
may readily be acquired in early life through sight and frequent 
writing. The modern industrial training which goes hand in 
hand with text-book education is, to a limited extent, in such in- 
stitutions as old as these schools. 
‘In conclusion, I beg to express my pleasure in the conviction 
that educational work in Tennessee is oceupying, year by year, 
higher and higher ground and becoming more and more general 
‘in its benefactions ; also to express the desire and purpose of the 
“management of this school to give, as far as possible, every deaf- 
mute child in Tennessee an education commensurate with the 
‘demands of the times and in harmony with the general advance- 
ment in education throughout the State and nation, and the. 
assistance of the teachers of Tennessee is asked in locating any 
uneducated deaf children in their respective communities and 
in giving parents and friends information concerning the school.

WATKINS INSTITUTE. 
Sir: The Commissioners of the Watkins Institute respectful- 
ly report that the establishment of a night school for the benefit 
of those young men and women who, on account of the necessity 
to labor during the day, cannot attend the publie schools—rather 
an experiment at first—has, after some years’ experience, more 
than realized the expectations which were entertained of its 
probable usefulness. The attendance is voluntary, and those 
only avail themselves of the privilege who, feeling the great 
benefit to be derived from an education, diligently apply them-_ 
selves to study; and as admission always depends upon previous 
good character, and continuance as‘a pupil rests upon subse- 
quent correct deportment, rules are seldom violated and breaches 
of discipline rarely—very rarely—occur. The utmost kind 
feeling prevails between the teachers and the pupils. The 
most useful branches which qualify for business are taught, but   
the range of studies embraces a curriculum about as extensive 
as that found in the average public schools. The report of the 
Superintendent, Capt. W. R. Garrett, is hereto appended, which 
contains full information as to all matters about which inquiry 
may be desired. 
The provisions of the will of the founder, the late Samuel 
Watkins, specify that the Commissioners are authorized to set 
apart and equip a room in the building to be used as a Public 
Library. Some years after his death another philanthropist, 
the late M. H. Howard, made a gift of money for the purchase 
of books, and recently the city of Nashville has made an appro- 
priation in aid of the Howard endowment. The Howard Library 
virtually constitutes a. part   
and a most useful and conspicuous 
part—of the Watkins Institute. The two philanthropists, Wat- 
kins and Howard, were friends in life, and, though now dead, 
live in the hearts of the people on account of the many benefac- 
tions they bestowed upon the charitable institutions of Nash- 
ville. The wise forecast of Mr. Watkins induced him to de-
-P-A-G-E-262
= 247 
clare in his will, after stating the general objects of his gifts, 
that the dead could not manage the affairs of the living, and 
hence he gave to the Commissioners a large discretion as to the 
manner in which his views should be carried out. This trust 
they have tried faithfully to execute. The meager endowment 
of the Library, notwithstanding the gift from the city, has been 
inadequate to purchase more books, or even to supply the place 
of those worn out, and hence they had the pleasing duty to lend 
valuable aid by furnishing heat, lights, and other helps which 
would have been expensive to the Library. No charge has been 
made for extra service imposed upon the Superintendent, engi- 
neer, and night watchman, the care of one branch of the estab- 
lishment necessarily involving the care of the other. These two 
institutions have proved of inestimable benefit to the general 
public. Indigent youths are admitted without charge to the 
school; while the Library has been the means of cultivating a 
taste for reading, and is justly regarded as one of the ornaments 
and attractions of Nashville. The Institute asks no appropria- , 
tion from the public treasury, but it has been declared by the 
General Assembly one of the charitable institutions of the State, 
and the Commissioners invite an investigation as to its manage- 
ment, and will be thankful for any suggestions that may be 
made calculated to promote its usefulness. The books of the 
Treasurer, showing the amount of rents received and vouchers 
fer every item of expenditure, will be laid before the committee.

To the Commissioners of Watkins Institute : 
GrNTLEMEN—I have the honor to submit to you the following 
report of the night school for the session beginning September 
5, 1898, and ending December 23, 1898. The school was opened 
and conducted in accordance with the circular of announce-

The attendance is shown in the following table:

The attendance during the past session was better and the 
enrollment larger than for the previous session. Up to Decem- 
ber 15 the attendance was much better than that of any previous 
session. About December 15 a large number of pupils were 
compelled to withdraw from school, for the reason that their 
services were required for work at night at their several places 
of business in order to make preparation for their Christmas 
trade. The large decrease during the last two weeks of the 
session made a considerable reduction in the average attendance. 
Many causes conspire to prevent the attendance at night
-P-A-G-E-264
— 249 — 
schools from being as regular and satisfactory as the attendance 
upon the thoroughly organized day schools; but it gives me 
pleasure to say that the attendance during the past session was 
more satisfactory than heretofore, and much better than the 
average in night schools. The spirit of the pupils was admira- 
ble, most of them were thoroughly in earnest, and their progress 
was excellent. It was not found necessary to inflict punish- 
ment of any kind, and there was very little occasion even for 
reprimand. In a single instance where a new pupil showed a 
disposition to be mischievous and insubordinate, the pupils 
themselves took the matter in hand and speedily convinced their 
fellow-pupil that the public spirit of the school was the peers 
of proper deportment. 
The experience of the session just closed goes to show that the 
Commissioners acted wisely in opening the school early in Sep- 
tember. I recommend that hereafter the school be opened the 
last week in August, so that it may close two weeks before Christ- 
mas, and thus avoid the period when more than one-half the 
pupils are compelled to work at night. 
In conclusion, it is my duty to testify to the zeal and ability 
with which my associates discharged their several functions. 
The success of the school is mainly due to their skillful and faith- 
ful work, and their noble spirit gave to their efforts the anima- 
tion of a labor of love. 
The pupils and teachers alike feel a sense of gratitude to Mr. 
Joseph S. Carels, Superintendent of the building, for his active 
and intelligent codperation. ‘ 
On behalf of the teachers and pupils, I take the liberty to ex- 
press to the Commissioners our thanks for the uniformly kind 
and courteous consideration which they have extended to us.

LANE COLLEGE. 
Sir: Lane College is located at Jackson, Tenn., and is the 
property of the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church in Amer- 
ica. The first building was erected in the year 1882, and in 
November of the same year the first. session was begun. It was 
chartered under the laws of Tennessee in 1884. In 1890 a two- 
story building was put up as a boarding department for the 
girls. In 1895 a three-story brick building was erected in 
order to meet the demand of the increasing number of pupils. 
This building has a large assembly hall, twelve recitation rooms, 
the President’s office, and a library. Hot-air furnaces warm the 
room. A dormitory for boys has just been completed. A print- 
ing office, sewing room, blacksmith shop, and wood shop have 
been erected. Lane College has the following departments: 
Primary, Intermediate, English, Normal, Preparatory, and 
Cellege. In addition to the above, we have the Theological, 
Musical, and Industrial Departments. 
A Missionary Society, Literary Society, Epworth League, 
and Young Men’s Christian Association have been organized. 
Through the influence of the late Rev. J. B. McFerrin, D.D., of 
Nashville, Tenn., the institution secured a large number of 
books, and a library was organized and named for its honored 
founder. Friends have continued. to contribute to it until it 
numbers about 1,500 volumes. 
There are nine professors and teachers, with assistant teach- 
ers from its Normal Department. The Methodist Episcopal 
Church raises a fund by assessment on the church by which the 
work is carried on. The President is a member of the Metho- 
dist Episcopal Church, South, and a member of the Memphis 
Conference, and the above church pays his salary. He has pre- 
sided over the school for nearly twelve years. 
The session of 1898-99 had an enrollment of 268 pupils. The 
present session opened with flattering prospects, the first month 
closing with an enrollment of 150. We have a monthly paper, 
the Lane College Reporter, which is edited by our own boys and 
girls. The catalogue is the work of our own force.

FISK UNIVERSITY. 
The scholastic year 1898-99 was a prosperous one in Fisk 
University, of Nashville. The total number of students in all 
departments was 507. This was an increase of 48 over the at- 
tendance of the previous year. Fourteen were graduated from 
the College Department, and 14 from the Normal Department. 
This makes the total number of graduates from the University 
412. Of these, 219 are teachers, and many of them are filling 
very important and responsible positions in both public and pri- 
vate institutions. Twenty-five are doctors, 11 are lawyers, and 
2° are ministers. Quite a number of the young women who 
have been graduated find their life work in their own homes. 
There have been no additions to the buildings of the Univer- 
sity during the year, but the necessity of a building for its large 
. Department of Musie is becoming imperative. During the 
year there were 165 students in pianoforte, pipe organ, voice 
culture, and violin. A company of Jubilee Singers has been 
sent North in the hope of raising money for ‘this and for other 
purposes. 
Fisk University holds unswervingly to the ideal which was set 
up at the founding of the Fisk School in the autumn of 1865. 
Its aim is to give to colored youth of both sexes the best ad- 
vantages it can command to pursue extended courses of study 
in. preparation for professional life and the higher responsibili- 
ties of citizenship. In doing this the value of manual train- 
ing is not overlooked, but less is being done in this direction at 
present than the Faculty would be glad to do, because of the 
want of income for more extended work. The University is in 
perfect sympathy with all institutions that are seeking to give 
industrial education, and a considerable number of its alumni 
are filling important positions in such institutions. 
During the year there were in attendance nine students under 
appointment of Senators to State Normal scholarships. In all 
cases these were faithful students and worthy of the help that 
was extended them by the State.

L’MOYNE NORMAL INSTITUTE. 
  
Sir: This institution was established in 1871 through the 
American Missionary Association. For some years previous 
the Association had sustained a number of common schools in 
the city of Memphis. ‘ 
In 1870, Dr. F. Julius LeMoyne, of Washington, Penn., a — 
lifelong, earnest, and active friend of the colored people, gave 
$20,000 to be used by the Association in founding an English 
school for colored youth at Memphis, Tenn. From this fund 
the necessary buildings were erected, and the school was opened 
in September, 1871. The Institute has since been sustained by 
the Association. é 
The school was designed to accommodate 250 pupils, but it 
has been necessary to make enlargement from time to time, until 
now over 500 pupils are in regular attendance, and many are — 
refused admission each year for lack of room. 
One hundred and fiftynine students have been graduated 
from the Normal Department, many of whom hold important 
positions in this and adjoining States. 
Special attention has been given to manual training during 
the past ten years, and rooms have been provided for very suc 
cessful work in typesetting and printing, in wood-working, in 
sewing, in cooking and household economy, and in the nursing 
and care of the sick. 
The school consists of a Normal Department and of Gram- 
mar, Intermediate, Primary, and Kindergarten Grades. The 
grades below the Normal provide for instruction in the common ~ 
school branches and furnish observation and training classes 
in which the students of the Normal Department may observe 
model school work and practice the methods of teaching given 
them by the teacher in methods. 
The above grades comprise a thirteen-years’ course of school 
work, which includes, besides the studies of the usual Normal 
School Course, with its special training in methods, depart- 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
— 253 — 
ments of manual training for both sexes. The manual or in- 
dustrial training comprises needlework, cooking and household 
economy, care of the sick, and type-setting for the girls; and 
wood-working, typesetting, and printing for the young men of 
the school. For this work the school has well-equipped sewing 
rooms, an experimental kitchen, a very complete printing office, 
and a wood-working shop with fourteen benches and sets of 
tools, besides lathes, scroll saw, mortising machine, ete. This 
work now takes the time of four special instructors. It is com- 
pulsory and is placed on the same footing as any other class work 
of the course. : 
The school possesses a complete text-book library, from which 
pupils may secure the use of necessary books free of cost. 
A general circulating library of two thousand well-selected 
volumes, and pleasant reading rooms, sustained in connection 
with the school, are entirely free to students and to the public. 
Philosophical apparatus, globes, charts, anatomical models, a 
human skeleton, and a considerable collection of natural history 
specimens give means for illustration and the thorough and in- 
telligent teaching of the various branches. 
The corps of teachers of the school numbers fifteen, in addi- 
tion to the Principal, who has had charge of the school for over 
twenty-five years. 
_ Nearly two hundred teachers have been graduated from the 
full Normal Course, many of whom hold prominent positions 
in West Tennessee and adjoining States. 
The rates of tuition charged are merely nominal, ranging 
from $1 per month in the Primary Grade to $1.75 per month 
in the Normal Department. Text-books are furnished free in 
all grades above the first year of the course. 
The school employs a teacher whose whole time is devoted to 
_ instruction in Music, vocal and instrumental. Four pianos are 
in use by this department. 
_ The students of the school have for several years sustained a 
well-ordered Literary Society, which holds weekly meetings and 
gives excellent opportunity for practice in debating and other

public speaking, and in literary work of various kinds. Its — 
privileges are open to both sexes alike. 4 
The school year is divided into two terms. The first term 
commences on the first Monday in October, and continues till” 
Christmas; the second term commences on the first Wednesday 
in January, and closes the first week in June.

KNOXVILLE COLLEGE. 
Sir: Knoxville College has entered on what promises to be 
one of the most prosperous years in its history. The attendance 
is good and a good spirit for work prevails everywhere. 
The College is under the control of the Board of Missions to | 
the Freedmen of the United Presbyterian Church of North 
This board is located in

College regarding free tuition for State students as prevail in 
the University for white students. State students are assigned 
work in one of the Industrial Departments, if they desire it, and 
receive compensation in proportion to the work accomplished. 
Thus they are enabled to earn somewhat of their expenses, and 
especially are taught a trade. Aside from money received from ~ 
the University as indicated above, the College is supported by 
voluntary contributions of the church. 
Rev. John S. McCulloch, D.D., who had been President of 
Knoxville College for twenty-two years, resigned his work last  
-P-A-G-E-272
— 255 — 
year by reason of age, and closed his connection with the College 
last June. He has retired from active work and has settled 
down with his invalid wife in Omaha, Neb. Until his resigna- 
tion he was the only President of the College. Rev. R. W. Me- 
Granahan, D.D., of Allegheny, Pa., was chosen his successor 
and entered on the work immediately. The Faculty, including 
the matrons and foremen of the Mechanical Departments, num- 
bers twenty-two. 
    The College occupies a commanding position on one of the 
hills historic in the siege of Knoxville in the Civil War. Its 
buildings consist of Recitation Hall, MeCullock Hall (Boys’ 
Dormitory), Elnathan Hall (Girls’ Dormitory), Little Boys’ 
Home, Little Girls’ Home, Mechanical Building, heating plant, 
barn, and President’s cottage. Its property of twenty-two acres 
and buildings is valued at $100,000. The Agricultural Depart- 
ment is not confined to the small acreage which the institution 
owns, but a considerable tract of adjoining land is rented, which 
will give employment to a goodly number of students. A green- 
house is being built, which will also give training to students in 
an important industry. An electric light plant is run entirely 
by the students under the direction of the Mechanical Professor, 
and by it all the buildings of the institution are lighted. Stu- 
dents who have been trained in this department have always 
found ready employment after leaving college. 
The usual college courses are taught and are maintained at 
tke high standard required for earning the degrees conferred. 
Tn addition to Classic, Scientific, Normal, and Literary Courses, 
a Medical Department has been opened up, which promises to 
take high rank, both in numbers and efficiency. A Theological 
Department, also, has been maintained for several years. i 
Under the direction of a practical printer, students are taught 
in this important industry. Besides doing all the printing for 
the College, a large amount of job work is done for outside par- 
ties. A large cylinder press, run by steam, does the heavier 
work, while job presses are used in the lighter work. Thus the 
students are trained in all that prepares one for taking charge 
of a job printing office. 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
— 256.— 
The Industrial Building is equipped with a twenty-five-horse- 
power engine, a circular saw, lathes, and workbenches, with out-_ 
fits of tools for work in wood. A competent instructor is over 
this work, and students are made familiar with the use of tools 
and are taught how to care for them. 
While the students of Knoxville College come from more than 
a third of the States, yet Tennessee furnishes by far the larger 
part of her students. About 300 students have been enrolled 
each year for several years. 
Knoxville College offers to colored youth the opportunity of 
a thorough literary and classical education, but combines with 
that the training of the hand in some useful employment. All 
students are required to do an hour’s industrial work of some 
kind each day, while the State students have the opportunity of 
werking for pay a much longer period. The head and hand 
and heart are trained, and the idea is to send out those who shall 
be entirely prepared and eager to help their fellow-beings. All 
are encouraged to go back to their homes and devote their lives 
to the uplifting of their fellow-beings in the communities where 
they have been brought up.

MORRISTOWN NORMAL COLLEGE. 
Sir: The Morristown Normal College was established in 1881, 
with one small building and two teachers. The original plant 
cost $250; the first year the enrollment was 193. In 1884 an- 
other building was added for dormitory purposes, and the enroll- 
ment had grown to 250, with five teachers. Since then the 
school has grown steadily and surely. In 1890 a building for 
the industrial training of girls was erected and furnished at a 
cost of $7,000; additional land was secured and considerable 
improvement made. During the present year another building, 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
26 
costing $30,000, was erected and furnished, and is used for a 
boarding hall; it is one of the most complete buildings in the 
South. The property to-day held by the institution has cost 
$75,000, and we are now contemplating the erection of an addi- 
tional building for school purposes, to cost $30,000, and, in 
addition to this, are planning to establish a school of industry 
for boys, in which they will be tanght iron work and wood-work 
in all its details. We now have fifteen teachers and an enroll- 
ment of over 300 students, representing eleven States. Our 
work is largely Normal. A conservative estimate shows that 
we have in the years of our history sent out to teach in the vari- 
cus Southern States not less than 2,000 young persons. These 
students are showing themselves to be qualified and well fitted 
by character and training for the work of teaching, which is a 
source of great encouragement tous. The school is largely sus- 
tained by voluntary contributions of friends; and while we do 
not purpose to make our students dependent, we put the cost of 
board and tuition at a minimum price, we aim to develop self- 
help to the fullest extent, and to this end we impress upon our 
students the necessity of paying their own way, and insist, upon 
their doing so. JUDSON S. HILL, President. 
ROGER WILLIAMS UNIVERSITY. 
Sir: This institution was founded in 1863, and has been suc- 
cessful since that time. Its object is “to furnish the elements 
of a solid and liberal Christian education for negro youth.” In 
the accomplishment of this object the school maintains a Theo- 
logical Department with thorough training in an English Course. 
This department numbers 18 students; the Collegiate Depart- 
ment, 25, leading to the degrees of A.B. and B.S. The Aca- 
~ demi¢ Department numbers 70, who are preparing to take a full 
College Course. The work in this department is intended not 
7
-P-A-G-E-275
— 258 — 
only to fit for college, but to give a fair general education to 
those who can go no farther. ~The Normal Department consists 
of 73, mostly girls, who are preparing themselves to become 
teachers in the public schools of the State. It is the aim of the 
department to fit them, both in character and in attainments, 
for the responsible places which they expect to fill. Both of the 
courses last named are for four years. The English Depart- 
ment consists of a two-years’ drill in those subjects which are vat: 
the foundation of an education. The teachers in this depart- 
ment are equal to any in the institution, on the principle that the 
foundation work is really the most important work of all. The 
English classes are expected also to furnish for the advanced 
‘elasses in the Normal Department models for instruction in 
methods of teaching. The Department of Music aims to give all 
students some instruction and training in the elements of vocal 
music, fitting them to read and render selections of ordinary 
grade. The instrumental music is considered and treated as 
additional to the regular work of the school. This department 
is felt to be considerably in advance of former years. 
The school being a Christian institution, the Bible is taught 
to all classes one recitation period each day, and all students are 
expected to become familiar at least with the structure and con- 
tents of the word of God. 
This year the school: has the exclusive service of an expe- 
rienced dressmaker and cutter, who gives regular instruction in 
these branches to all the girls. Other branches of industrial 
work are pursued, but not with the facilities and thoroughness 
that are desired and are expected in the future. 
The school has enrolled thus far 221 students, with others 
still expected. The year has opened well, and bids fair to be one 
of the most satisfactory and successful in the history of the in- 
stitution. P. B. GUERNSEY, President.

FREEDMAN’S NORMAL INSTITUTE, 
Sir: Freedman’s Normal Institute, founded in 1872 in the 
town of Maryville, the county seat of Blount County, has been, 
and is, a very important factor in the moral, intellectual, and 
religious-education of the colored people, not only in the town 
and community in which it is located, but it has also exerted a 
asting influence in the South and West, having sent out young 
men and women of character and ability who are not only able 
© compete with students of other schools, but, perforce of their 
training, forge their way to the front. Many of its students 
going South and West as teachers have become principals of 
he best-paying schools. Some have entered other professions. 
The general object of the institution is the thorough and sys- 
ematic development of the intellectual powers and moral charac- 
er of the student and the full equipment of men and women for 
any demand that may be made upon them in the various walks 
ot life, to which end the courses of study are well adapted. 
Believing also that much is to be gained by the industrial 
raining of the colored people, as the industries lie at the founda- 
tion of permanent success, it is hoped that the institution will 
in the near future be in a position to add an Industrial Depart- 
ment, thus combining the education of the intellect with that of 
he hand. The institution is not satisfied with the good it has 
already accomplished, but is desirous of doing still more by 
meeting the growing demand of the age. Among its greatest 
needs are funds for the enlargement of the teaching force to meet 
the increase of students and for a more thorough prosecution of 
the work; also, scholarships are much in demand for needy stu- 
dents. Books for the library and current. literature for the 
reading room would greatly enhance the student’s opportunity 
for valuable knowledge. Situated sixteen miles south of Knox- 
ville, at the terminus of the Knoxville and Augusta Railroad, in 
the quiet town of Maryville, noted for the intelligence and moral- 
ity of its citizens, free from the saloon and the gambling den

which fascinate and charm the unfortunate of the race in the 
larger cities, there is no institution in Tennessee more favorable 
by natural suroundings to permanent growth, or that will give — 
better promise for encouragement by the State or private indi- 
viduals. L. H. GARNER, Principal. 
CENTRAL TENNESSEE COLLEGE. 
In 1866 the Tennessee Legislature incorporated the first 
Board of Trustées under the head “ Central Tennessee College 
for the Literary and Theological Education of the Colored Peo- 
ple.” This name was afterwards changed to “ Central Ten- 
nessee College.” In 1866-67, while the school was continued in 
the gun factory, Rev. O. O. Knoght was Principal part of the 
year, and Rey. W. B. Crichlow succeeded him the remainder of 
the year. These were assisted by Mrs. Mary Murphy, Miss 
Julia Evans, Miss Emily E. Preston, Miss O. D. Barber, Misses” 
Nettie and Mary Mann, and Mrs. Mary Larned. During this 
year it is said that over eight hundred students were enrolled. 
The pupils were made up of all ages and all grades, from the 
alphabet up to percentage in Arithmetic, and from the child 
three or four years old to the grandfather of seventy winters. 
Frequently the three generations were found in the same class, 
and often the grandchildren would prove better pupils than 
their parents or grandparents. At the opening of the city 
schools in 1867 the attendance at the College was small. Rev. 
J. Braden was appointed Principal of the school, and was also 
elected President during the year. At the close of this year 
the school was moved from the gun factory because of the re- 
turn of the property to the original owners. The building had 
been used during the war for hospital and other purposes inci- 
dent to war times. At the close of 1867 the school was moved 
into the only building which was on the grounds purchased by
-P-A-G-E-278
— 261 — 
the Trustees; and as there was a small fee charged, the number 
was comparatively small; but the building was crowded. It 
had been used and abused like other buildings that were 
available for the soldiers during the campaign in and about 
Nashville. During this year the Freedman’s Bureau repaired 
the building in which the school was held and built the chapel, 
and also what is known as the “ Boarding Hall.” The first ef- 
fort of the school was to secure teachers and preachers for the 
colored people, hence what is called the “‘ Normal Department” 
was organized. Dr. Seys gathered the preachers—as many of 
them as he could—taught them the principles of Bible truth, 
and this began what was required by the charter of the Colleze— 
_ the Theological Department. The first catalogue for the school 
was issued for the year 1869-70. It enrolled 114 males and 127 
females, the total being 241, and they were classified as follows: 
Preparatory Department, 17; Theological Department, 76; the 
others were in the Primary Department. In 1872 the build- 
‘ings would no longer accommodate our students, and a band of 
singers, known as “ The Tennesseans,” sung through the North 
and raised money by which the large building known as “ Ten- 
nessee Hall” was constructed. This last building is a substan- 
tial four-story brick, partly adapted for school purposes and 
partly for a dormitory. During the year 1875, through the 
assistance of Mr. Samuel Meharry, of Shawnee Mound, Ind., 
and the kindness of R. J. Snead, of Nashville, assisted by Dr. 
G. W. Hubbard, a Medical Department was opened in the base- 
ment of the new building, with a class of eight young men. In 
-1878 Hon. John Lawrence volunteered to instruet young men 
who desired to study law. This he did for no compensation. 
other than the small amount contributed by the fees. In Octo- 
ber, 1880, the Medical Department having grown to such propor- 
tions that it demanded a new building, one was erected and 
dedicated to the service of God and suffering humanity. This 
building was largely the gift of the Meharry family. In 1882, 
_ for the full course of the Theological Department, Julius J. Hol- 
land received the degree of B.D. This department has been 
open almost from the beginning of the school. The Bible, Cate-
-P-A-G-E-279
S00 
chism, and Discipline comprised at first the entire curriculum, 
and then other studies were added until the full Theological 
Course was furnished the students. The Dental Department 
was opened in 1886. The new building for this department 
and also for the Department of Pharmacy was dedicated in 
1889. Ex-President of the United States Rutherford B. Hayes, 
Postmaster General D. M. Key, and Rev. J. C. Hartzell, D.D., 
made addresses on that occasion. The John F. Slater Indus- 
trial Department was opened in 1884. Mr. C. S. Randals was 
employed as Superintendent of Carpentry, and Dr. G. W. Hub- 
bard took charge of the printing office. The young women — 
were taught needlework and dressmaking. The department of 
housework, nursing, and cooking had been provided for as far as 
the means of the College would allow. The blacksmith shop 
was opened in 1888, with Mr. E. E. Gibson as Superintendent ; 
the tin shop, in 1889, in charge of Mr. C. H. Williams. The 
African Training School is designed to prepare missionaries 
for work in Africa by giving them knowledge of the people, the 
climate, the wants of the people, and also instruction in medi- 
cine and such trades as will tend to increase their usefulness as 
missionaries. There were classes in shorthand and typewriting 
as early as 1889, with Rev. A. Sealy as Instructor. On October 
15, 1890, a mechanical shop was dedicated to the young men for 
work. The object of this department was to train young men 
in the use of the planer and other iron-working machines. The 
students gave some evidence of ability to manufacture tools for 
carpentry and other trades. The department was in charge of 
Rey. H. G. Sedrick. 
The attendance for the past several years has been as fol- 
lows: In 1868, at the opening of free schools in Nashville, 225 ; 
in 1878, 295; in 1888, 541. 
The buildings consist of six large brick structures, with eight 
other buildings that are used for shops and residences, with a 
large area of ground, which altogether are valued at $110,000. 
We have fair apparatus in the Departments of Pharmacy, 
Dentistry, and Medicine, and a library of about 5,000 volumes. 
The buildings are too small for the number of students, and we
-P-A-G-E-280

hope to have additional room for industrial work, especially for 
the young men. 
In the Literary Department, the common English Course em- 
braces a period of about six years, beginning with what would be 
in our common schools the Fourth Grade. This is followed by 
the Normal and Preparatory Courses, the Normal Course having 
four years and the Preparatory Course having three years. 
The College Course, the Philosophical Course, and the Scientific 
Course have, each, four years. 
During the past year our enrollment was: Males, 329; fe- 
males, 202; total, 531. In the Theological Department there 
were enrolled 21; Law, 12; Medical, 165; Dental, 19; Phar- 
macy and Obstetrics, 17; and in Taseomnantel Music, 71; Vocal 
Music, 180; Art, 27; Shorthand and Typewriting, 10; Carpen- 
try, 10; Tin Work, 7; Printing, 38; Blacksmithing, 4; and in 
the different College classes, Preparatory and Normal, and spe- 
cials, 104. 
The entire number of our graduates in all departments is over 
‘700. These have entered upon-business largely as doctors, 
teachers, and preachers. A few have entered upon mechanical 
work and are doing excellent work, and a large number are mak- 
ing excellent housekeepers. All of our graduates have been, so 
far as we know, exempt from any great crime; none of them 
have been confined in the penitentiary, so far as we know, and 
those wha have entered the professions have found their white 
competitors dealing very fairly and very kindly. They have 
been received into the councils of the medical fraternities, and 
have been respectfully received in the courts where they have 
practiced. They have been suecessful as editors of papers, as 
presidents of colleges, principals of high schools, and teachers 
in common schools in nearly all the States - the South. Most 
of them have taught in Tennessee. 
- The school is supported, so far as teachers are concerned, 
almost entirely by the Freedmen’s Aid Society of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church, which has spent more than .a hundred thou- 
sand dollars for the salaries of the teachers and quite a large 
sum for property and buildings.

Students who have attended the College as State Normal _ 
pupils have generally done well, have proved themselves worthy 
of the help thus furnished, and have taught more than two years” 
on an average in the State of Tennessee. The students last year - 
were from nineteen different States, the island of Jamaica, In- 
dian Territory, and Africa. J. BRADEN, President.

“Tn view of the importance to the public of the adoption of 
text-books for general use in the public schools, and the short 
time before the schools are tq open, the Text-book Commission 
deems it proper to make known its action to the public for the 
_ benefit of patrons, teachers, pupils, and school officials through- 
out the State. 
“At the earliest practicable date after the passage of the law 
providing for uniform text-books, the Text-book Commission 
was organized by the appointment from the State Board of Edu- 
cation of the members provided by law. The Commission met 
on the 18th day of May, 1899, and prepared advertisements for 
bids and appointed the Text-book Subcommission, composed of 
the following members: Wharton S. Jones, Charles Mason, F. 
-M. Bowling, W. N. Billingsley, J. G. Stinson. It designated
-P-A-G-E-287
21 
noon, May 25, 1899, as the latest date on which bids would be 
received under the advertisement; and noon, June 20, 1899, as 
the time for the Subcommission to report its findings and for 
the opening of the bids filed with the Secretary of State. 
“On June 20 the Subcommission asked for an extension of 
time until 4 o’clock, June 21, within which to make its report, 
which was granted. After a most careful, painstaking, and effi- 
cient investigation, it made a clear and concise report of its find- 
ings. Said report has been placed on file in the office of the 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, for public inspection, as 
required by law. 
“Immediately thereafter this Commission began the consid- 
eration of books submitted, with the bids and the report and 
gradings of the Subcommission upon the relative merit of the 
books. ‘The Commission found the Subcommission’s report of 
the greatest service in accelerating its work and aiding it in 
arriving at a satisfactory conclusion. The Commission found | 
that there was no uniformity in the text-books throughout the 
State; that in some instances books have been kept for many 
years, and in others changes were very frequently made. One 
county would have one series, and an adjoining county would 
have a different series, so that frequently patrons moving from 
one county, or one school district, to another, found their stock 
of school literature worthless, and were forced to buy new books. 
Not only were frequent changes made necessary in this way, but 
changes in Superintendents, teachers, and school boards in the 
different counties brought with them a change of text-books and 
a consequent loss of purchase money invested in books on hand. 
It is impossible to estimate the amount of this loss, but there was 
a sacrifice whenever and wherever these changes were made. 
The Commission also found that books were being sold at a price 
_very much in excess of their intrinsic value. 
“ The Commission believes that a great saving will be effected, 
first, by the reduction, under the uniform text-book law, of the 
cost of all schoolbooks; and, secondly, in the permanency and 
uniformity of the books selected, whereby they can be used until 
‘worn out, instead of having to be laid aside while comparatively
-P-A-G-E-288
271 = 
new. The exact amount of this saving it is very difficult to esti- 
mate; but there is not a single book adopted by the Commission 
upon which a very material reduction has not been effected, 
varying from 15 per cent to 60 per cent. Not only this, but, 
taking the entire State, it is safe to say that the best series of 
text-books, as a whole, ever in use in the State, has been ob- 
tained; and considering the binding, mechanical work, paper 
required in the contracts, the composition and subject-matter, 
it is certain that. the quality of books is greatly improved. The 
~Commission has endeavored, wherever possible, to adopt the 
most modern and improved editions. 
“ While the books selected are in every respect satisfactory, 
the following may be given as illustrations of the great saving 
which the Commission has made: Writing books are reduced 
from 10 cents per copy to 3 cents and 4 cents; Spellers, from 
20 cents to 14 cents; First Readers, from 25 cents to 16 
cents; Second Readers, from 35 cents and 40 cents to 22 
cents; Third Readers, from 50 cents to 30 cents; Fourth Read- 
ers, ten 65 cents to 35 cents; Fifth Readers, from 90 cents 
to 42 cents; Elementary Arithmetics, from 35 cents to 22 cents; 
Practical Arithmetics, from’60 cents to 42 cents; Geographies, 
from 55 cents to 40 cents, and from $1.25 to 88 cents. Corre- 
sponding reductions have been made in other books adopted by 
this Commission. ' 
“This Commission has had submitted for its consideration 
the best books of the leading publishers of the country, including 
those of all the books now in use in this State; and while this 
Commission has given due consideration to every interest. of the 
State and to the inconvenience which follows a change of text- 
books, it has in no case made a change or adopted a new book 
which would not, in its judgment, benefit the people. 
“Tt has been actuated not simply by a desire for books that 
cost less, but has also striven to obtain, and believes it has ob- 
tained, a series of books the equal of those in use in any other 
State. 
. “ Where this change has been tried in other States, there is no 
instance in which it has not resulted in a saving to the people;
-P-A-G-E-289
ail 
and in most instances, where parties are called upon for an ex- _ 
pression of opinion concerning the system, it has received com- 
mendation. It is a fact, borne out by everyday experience, that. 
the most expensive printing and the most costly books paid for — 
by the people are the books used in our common schools. When 
we remember that Tennessee has a scholastic population of near- 
ly 800,000, and has more than 18,000 public school teachers and 
officials, we can form some idea of the great saving by this re- 
duction in the price of every schoolbook used in our public 
schools. 
“Tt has been the purpose of this Commission, in all its adop- 
tions, to select a complete series upon each subject in order that 
the school which desires it may use any one or all the books of a 
series. We have recognized in our adoptions the vertical and 
slant systems of writing, in order that the schools may select 
that which best suits them. While Dictionaries are not taught 
in all the schools, the Commission had submitted to it standard 
school Dictionaries at so great a reduction in price that it 
deemed it a duty to make an adoption of them for school use. 
“The Commission has adopted a Plane Geometry, also a 
Plane and Solid Geometry; a Primary History, also an Ad- 
vanced History of the United States; an Intermediate and an 
Advanced Geography; a series of Physiologies; Single-entry 
Bookkeeping, also a Single and Double Entry Combined, in 
order that the varied wants of all schools throughout the State 
may be met; but in doing this the Commission does not decide 
that all the books as named herein must be taught, but leaves to 
the schools to decide from the list adopted by it the particular 
book desired on the required subjects. 
“The Commission gives below the names of the successful 
bidders and the books, with contract and exchange prices. Where 
a person has an old book, he can exchange it for a new one of 
similar grade by paying the exchange price; and if he has no 
book on hand, he will, in purchasing a new one for any grade, 
pay the contract price. The contract and exchange prices will 
be printed upon all books adopted by this Commission.

“The Subcommission recommended that the Text-book Com- 
mission readvertise for a History of Tennessee and a Geology 
of Tennessee. This Commission will, therefore, at the earliest 
practical date, advertise for books and manuscripts on n these sub-_ 
jects. 
“The State Superintendent of Public Instruction will, in 
accordance with the law, within the next few days, issue a cireu- 
lar setting forth in detail the names of the books adopted and 
the contract and exchange prices. He will also give full infor- 
mation as to the method of putting the books into the schools, 
and the place or places in each county where the books adopted 
may be procured. 
“The Commission, after carefully considering the interests 
of all the schools and conferring with the publishers, has de- 
cided that the books adopted by it shall be used in all the schools 
of the State, from and after 8 o’clock A.M., September 1, 1899. 
“The Commission urges all parents, pupils, teachers, and 
‘school authorities, who purchase new books or rearrange their 
courses of study between now and that date, to purchase the 
books adopted by this Commission and arrange the course of 
study in accordance with it. It has been the purpose of this 
Commission, as it was evidently the purpose of the Legislators, 
to secure such a system as would guarantee better text-books to
-P-A-G-E-292
eae 
students, improve the method of teaching, and raise the standard 
of education throughout the State. 
“The Commission realizes that there will be some difficulty 
and inconvenience consequent upon the necessary changes made. 
There will also be some inconvenience resulting therefrom to 
teachers, but the benefits to be derived are so great and overbal- 
ance to such an extent the inconvenience that teachers, patrons, 
pupils, and school officials of the State should stand ready, as 
they doubtless will do, to lend every aid and encouragement in 
carrying out the letter, spirit, and purposes of the law, and in 
reaping from this beneficent legislation all of the advantages 
that are contemplated and that are possible. 
“The Commission feels that it has faithfully and conscien- 
tiously performed its duty, without prejudice or partiality, and 
has given to the people of the State a series of books which meets 
every requirement and expectation of the times, and the Com- 
mission is especially proud to offer them, confidently believing 
that, after a full, fair, and thorough trial, they will be uniformly 
approved by the public. .

The Commission was not satisfied with the books offered on 
subjects not embraced in the above adoption, and has, aceord- 
ingly, readvertised for other books to be submitted for adoption 
cn November 1, 1899. Under the law, the Commission has 
fixed September 1, 1899, as the date on which all books adopted 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
et 
by the Commission must be introduced and used in all of the 
public schools in Tennessee. 
Section 1 of said law says: “ The text-books shall be used for 
a period of five years in all the public schools of this State, and 
it shall not be lawful for any school officer, director, or teacher 
to use any other book upon the same branches, other than those 
adopted by the State Text-book Commission.” 
Tt is your duty, under this law, to inform your teachers and 
public school officials that on and after September 1, 1899, the 
books adopted by the Commission, and herein named, must be 
taught in all the public schools exclusively, in such grades as 
they are suited and upon the subjects indicated. 
The Commission has not adopted a Mental Arithmetic, Higher 
Arithmetic, Geology of Tennessee, and History of Tennessee. 
Until books are adopted by the Commission on these subjects, 
students may use the books now on hand. No supplementary 
books have been adopted, and all schools are at liberty to use such 
supplementary books as are most desirable, provided such books 
are not used to the exclusion of any book adopted by the Com- 
mission. 
It will be noted that the Commission has, whenever practica- 
ble, adopted a complete series on each subject, so that the teacher 
and the pupil may have, at reduced prices, choice of any one 
book in a series and of all books in the series. By the adoption 
of a number of books on any given subject, it is not the intention 
of the Commission to compel the use of all such books, but to 
leave this matter to the discretion of teachers and school boards. 
To illustrate: The Commission adopted three Physiologies— 
Beginner’s, Intermediate, and Comprehensive—in order that 
the teachers who desire three books upon this subject may use 
all of them, and other teachers not desiring so many may use 
one or two, as they think best. If Physiology is taught in the 
schools, the book used must be one of those adopted by the Com- 
mission, and the teacher is at liberty to make his own selection. 
The same is true of all other subjects. The Commission does 
not designate the number of books to be used, but has adopted 
on these subjects a sufficient number of books to meet the varied
-P-A-G-E-295
= 278 — 
demands of all public schools. In no case would the use of any 
book not adopted by this Commission be permitted, if the use 
of such book would interfere with, or exclude from the schools, — 
any book or books adopted by the Commission. 
The Commission has selected Hyde’s Language Lessons, 
which is a very excellent book, and I urge you to include this in 
your course of study for the schools of your county. I think 
you will find it of value in all schools and realize that it is suited 
to your system of grading. 
The Commission adopted the vertical and slant systems of 
Writing, in order that teachers may select and teach the one 
best suited to their schools. The Commission expressed no 
preference between these systems, and leaves the selection of 
either the slant or vertical to the good judgment of public school 
teachers and officials. 
Alexander’s Primer, selected by the Commission, is consid- 
ered well adapted for use in the First Grade in public schools. 
In accordance with the law and the contracts executed, pub- 
lishers have established general depositories at. Nashville, Jack- 
son, and Knoxville, where a supply of books will be kept con- 
stantly on hand sufficient in quantity to meet all immediate 
demands. The general depositories are: Hunter & Welburn, 
Nashville; Joseph & Co. and D. A. Lyerla & Co., Jackson; E. 
E. McCroskey and Ogden Bros., Knoxville. Agencies have 
been established at every county seat in the State, where all 
books adopted by the Commission will be kept constantly on 
sale after September 1, 1899. The publishers are contracting 
with merchants in every locality in each county to handle these 
books, so that they may be within convenient distance of all the 
people. The contract and exchange prices of each book shall 
be printed upon it, and all sales and exchanges made in accord- 
ance with these prices. Any violation of these instructions, or 
complaint made to you by citizens of your county on account of 
the manner of exchange by merchants or the prices of books, 
should be reported by you to this office. 
The text-book law (Section 5) provides that the “contractors 
shall. take up the schoolbooks now in use in this State, and re-
-P-A-G-E-296
le 
ceive the same in exchange for new books at a price not less than 
50 per cent of cash price.” All contracts made with publishers 
have, as Section 5, the following: 
“ That the party of the second part [the publishers] further 
agrees to supply each and all of the books embraced in this con- 
tract at the exchange prices hereinafter quoted, in those cases 
where there is offered in part payment an old book which was 
in use in Tennessee on the 13th day of April, 1899, and which 
is of like grade and upon the same subject as the one for which 
it is taken in part payment; provided, that the time in which 
old books heretofore in use in Tennessee can be exchanged for 
new books be limited to May 1, 1900.” 
The Commission construes the clause in the law and contracts, 
“ schoolbooks now in use,” to mean -those used in previous ses- 
sicns of the school, and such books as would be used by the stu- 
_ dents in the schools of the State, had not this law been passed 
and new books adopted. Books which are in a usable and teach- 
able condition should be taken by the merchant in exchange at 
the price fixed by the Commission, without question. No cer- 
tificate, to be signed by parent, guardian, teacher, or pupil, will 
be permitted, and merchants have no authority, under the law, 
to require their use. Publishers have no authority to issue in- 
structions to merchants or teachers about the method of ex- 
change or rules governing it. All questions of this kind should 
be determined by the Text-book Commission, under the law and 
in accordance with the contracts made by the publishers. Muti- 
lated books must be taken in exchange, provided such books are 
in condition to be used by the students in the school. A book 
otherwise in good condition should be taken in exchange, if the 
back is torn off and pencil marks are in it. Books with good 
backs and otherwise in reasonable condition, with a few leaves 
missing, should also be taken in exchange. The meaning of the 
Jaw is, that a book having been used by the pupil, with his name 
written on it, the back torn off, with only a few leaves missing— 
provided, of course, that it is in such condition that he would 
have used it in school this term, had not this adoption been made 
—should be taken in exchange. Books should be exchanged
-P-A-G-E-297
  — 280 — 
  book for book, grade by grade, subject by subject, in accordance 
with the contract and exchange prices—that is, a Fourth Reader 
should be exchanged for a Fourth Reader, a Primary Geography — 
for a Primary Geography, an Advanced Arithmetic for an Ad- 
vanced Arithmetic. It would not be reasonable to expect a 
merchant to exchange a Fourth Reader for a First Reader, or a 
Geography for a Grammar, and such is not required. Any vio- 
lation of these instructions by agents or merchants selling or 
offering to sell books should be reported to this office, in order 
that the Text-book Commission may consider the matter and 
correct the violation. e3 
The Commission has selected the best books offered at the 
most reasonable prices. Some books were offered at lower prices 
than those adopted, in some eases, but were not chosen by the 
Commission, because the binding, paper, or subject-matter was 
not satisfactory. The average reduction in prices of books 
adopted by the Commission is more than 33 per cent. The 
Cemmission requires that these books be taught in all publie 
schools in this State—city and county—for a period of five — 
years,, beginning on September 1, 1899. The period of ex- 
change begins immediately and continues until May 1, 1900. 
It is important that you explain fully the provisions of the law, 
the method of exchange, the prices of books, and the exchange 
period, in order that every one who desires to do so may take 
advantage of the reduced prices and reasonable exchange. 
It has been the purpose of the Commission to select books best 
suited and adapted for use in our schools, and the Commission 
is satisfied that the books selected are much superior in subject- 
matter, binding, and relative merit, to those now in use in the 
State. This adoption gives all the schools uniformity in books, 
and will enable you to arrange a satisfactory course of study 
and systematically grade your public schools. 
Tt is the duty of school-teachers and school officials to respect, 
obey, and aid in the enforcement of this law, it matters not what 
their opinions may be as to the wisdom of its passage. I believe 
that you will agree with me that the selection of better books,
-P-A-G-E-298
— 281 — 
the latest revised editions, at greatly reduced prices, guarantee- 
ing uniformity throughout the State, will materially aid our 
public schools. I am confident of your codperation in giving 
this law a fair and impartial trial. 
MORGAN C. FITZPATRICK, 
State Superintendent. 
SECOND ADOPTION. 
Subsequent to the former adoption the Commission advyer- 
tised for other books, which were submitted to the Subcommis- 
sion for gradings. The Commission adopted the following 
bocks: Geology of Tennessee, by Killebrew and Safford, pub- 
lished by Foster & Webb, Nashville; Cook and Cropsy’s Higher 
Arithmetic, published by Brandon Printing Company, Nash- 
ville; Mental Arithmetic, published by R. L. Meyers & Co., 
Harrisburg, Pa.; Garrett and Goodpasture’s History of Ten- 
nessee, published by Brandon Printing Company, Nashville; 
History of Tennessee for Primary Schools, by G. R. McGee, 
published by American Book Company. 
Books of this last adoption are not required to be taught until 
Tune 1, 1900. 
The publishers with whom contracts were made established 
the following general depositories: Middle Tennessee, Hunter 
& Welburn, Nashville; East Tennessee, E. E. McCroskey and 
Ogden Bros., Knoxville; West Tennessee, W. T. Harris and D. 
Lyerla, Jackson. 
These depositories have made contracts with merchants in all 
the localities throughout the State to handle their books.

PEABODY NORMAL COLLEGE 
INVESTIGATION. 
Some dissatisfaction having arisen because of the change of 
some members of the Faculty of the Normal College and other 
matters, a special committee of the State Board of Education 
was appointed to take testimony and make a report of their find- 
ing. The report and resolution of the State Board of Educa- 
tion follow: 
Hon. Benton McMillin, President of the State Board of Edu- 
cation—Sir: Your’ committee, appointed to investigate the 
Peabody Normal College, under the management of Dr. W. H. 
Payne, respectfully submits herewith its report, and all the tes- 
timony. 
The committee had no power of process, and could not compel 
the attendance of witnesses. It began by requesting all the 
members of the faculty and a number of the members of the 
State Legislature who had spoken about the college to appear 
before the committee and give testimony. The committee asked 
each witness before it to suggest the name of all persons thought 
to have information concerning the college, and requested im- 
mediately every such person whose name was in any way sug- 
gested to appear and give testimony. The investigation was not — 
governed by strict rules of evidence, for it was the desire of the 
committee to ascertain all of the facts, and for that reason the 
greatest latitude was given to witnesses, and they were asked to 
give without reservation a statement of all the facts which they 
had in their possession, as wel! as current reports and rumors. 
The committee in every possible way endeavored to obtain the 
testimony of every person said to know anything about the col- 
lege, and to this end requested all that they could to come before 
it, and gave notice through the public press that it would 
be glad that any others whose names were unknown to it should 
appear and give statements. The evidence of these witnesses, 
some one hundred in number, was taken in shorthand. There

being no appropriation to pay for printing or publishing tes- 
timony, we submit a typewritten copy of it, in order that the ~ 
Board may examine it and may submit the same to the inspec- 
tion of the public and any person desiring to see it. 
Before entering upon.a consideration of the proof taken by us, 
we believe a clearer understanding of the whole situation can be 
had by giving you the result of our investigations in regard to 
the legal status of the institution and the several boards con- 
nected therewith. 
The Legislature of Tennessee, by proper Act at the session of 
1875, March 23 of that year, passed a law “ providing for the 
establishment, maintenance, and government of a Normal school 
or schools in the State of Tennessee in connection with the pub- 
lie school system thereof.” This Act in brief constituted the 
State Board of Education, and empowered said Board in the 
manner and form prescribed in said Act to establish a Normal 
school or schools at different points in the State, upon certain 
terms and conditions herein embraced. The third section of 
said Act provided that “ nothing in this Act shall be so construed 
as to authorize the expenditure of money from the State Treas- 
ury or school funds of the State.” Section 4 of said Act provided 
that “said State Board of Education may receive contributions 
of money from the Trustees of the Peabody Education Fund or 
donations of property or funds from any other sources for the 
benefit of this enterprise.” Section 5 provided that “ the trus- 
tees of colleges, universities, or educational institutions shall 
have power to give the use of their property to the State Board 
of Education for the benefit of the Normal schools.” The Acts of 
the Legislature, session of 1881, repealed so much of Section 3 
of the Act of 1875, quoted above, which provided that nothing 
in said act should be so construed as to authorize the expenditure 
of money from the State Treasury or school funds of the State, 
and went further and authorized the State Board of Education 
to appropriate $10,000 of the funds of the State, not otherwise 
appropriated, for the establishment of a Normal school or schools 
in conformity with the original Act of 1875, and that said sum of 
$10,000 should, in the discretion of said State Board, be award- 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
— 287 — 
ed to the school or schools that said Board should deem proper 
and best. The Legislature of 1883 further so amended said 
original Act of 1875 as to authorize the said State Board of Ed- 
ucation to apply the whole of the $10,000 to the support of the 
Peabody Normal College established at Nashville. 
Those three Acts embrace all the legislation bearing upon the 
subject, except that subsequent Acts from time to time have 
authorized annual appropriations, which were increased from 
$10,000 to $15,000, and later from $15,000 to $20,000, as now 
existing, conditioned always upon the giving of scholarships 
to the State. 
We find, by an examination of the minutes of the State Board 
of Edueation (which was created under said Act of 1875, which 
met and organized for the purposes therein specified in May, 
1875), and likewise the minutes of the Board of Trustees of the 
University of Nashville, that the University of Nashville, by prop- 
er resolution, conveyed to the State Board of Education its build- — 
ings and grounds in the city of Nashville for the purpose of ¢s- 
tablishing a State Normal School. This resolution provided that 
this should be done with the distinct understanding and agree- 
ment that the University of Nashville, through its Board of 
Trustees, should elect the President of said Normal College, 
with all other teachers, and fix the salaries or compensation 
thereof, and that this should continue for the period of two years 
from its acceptance by the State Board of Education. We find 
that the State Board of Education duly accepted the offer of the 
University Board, and that, with a contribution from the Pea- 
body Board of Trust of $6,000 per annum, the college was es- 
tablished and from that time prospered. 
Upon the donation of the buildings and meant by the Uni- 
versity Board and the money furnished by the Peabody Board, 
the State Board of Education thereupon passed a. resolution re- 
questing the University Board to select its President and other 
officers and teachers, which was done. 
We find, in addition to the above, from the minutes of the State 
Board of Education and the minutes of the Board of the Uni- 
versity of Nashville, that from time to time thereafter for sev-
-P-A-G-E-305
— 280 — 
eral years the Chancellor of the University, Dr. Stearns, con- 
ferred with the State Board of Education in regard to the con- 
duct of the school, the expenditure of the funds at its disposal, 
and after the State had begun its contributions to its support in — 
1881 that the disposition of such contributions was fully ex- 
plained and accounted for to the State Board of Education, and 
that as vacancies occurred in the corps of teachers or the number 
was increased, the President filled such vacancies or added 
to the number of teachers. In some instances we find upon the 
minutes of the State Board of Education that where the Presi- 
dent reported to said Board his action in such matters, the 
State Board ratified and confirmed such appointments, but we ~ 
fail to find anywhere any legal authority for such action upon 
their part, although the minutes show that it was permitted or 
acquiesced in by the Board of Trustees of the University of 
Nashville. 
We fail to find upon the minutes of cither board any further 
record showing any arrangement, contract, or agreement for the 
conduct and management of the school other than that shown in 
the proceedings of the above boards in May, 1875, which, as 
stated, was for a period of two years only, until, in 1889, it ap- 
pears in the minutes of the Board of Trustees of the University 
of Nashville that it was proposed to establish and erect a Model 
School upon the grounds of the University of Nashville, and that 
the Peabody Board of Trust was unwilling to furnish the money 
therefor without a clearer understanding in regard to their 
rights in the premises, whereupon the Board of Trustees of the 
University of Nashville, on November 19, 1889, passed the fol- 
lowing resolution, offered by Judge William F. Cooper: 
“Resolved, by the Board of Trustees of the University of 
Nashville, That the land, with the buildings and other improve- 
ments thereon now used and occupied by the Normal School 
under the auspices of the Trustees of the Peabody fund, contain- 
ing about sixteen acres, be, and the same are hereby, pledged and 
devoted to that purpose and such other educational purposes as 
may be preferred by the Trustees of the Peabody fund, so long 
as the Normal School and such other educational institutions as
-P-A-G-E-306
— 289 — = 
may meet with their approval shall be fostered and sustained by 
the said Trustees or by means received from that fund; and we 
hereby authorize the said Trustees to erect on the said land any 
additional building or buildings or other improvements by them 
deemed necessary to carry out the above educational purposes.” 
The minutes of both boards are silent upon any further ac- 
tion by either in regard to the conduct of the school, but the 
Secretary of the Board of Trustees of the University of Nash- 
ville states that his understanding, and that of his Board, was 
that “so long as those conditions existed, the transfer to the 
Peabody Board, though not a legal one, was morally a transfer 
of all that property for the use and under the control of the Pea- 
bedy Board.” 
The records of the Board of Trustees of the University of 
Nashville show, furthermore, that the Peabody Board had ex- 
ercised the right of electing or appointing the President of the 
Normal College, and that the Board of Trustees for the Uni- 
versity of Nashville had selected or elected the Chancellor of 
the University. It appears that the President of the Normal 
College and the Chancellor of the University were two sepa- 
rate and distinct offices which could have been filled by differ- 
eni persons, the occasion for which was that the University of 
Nashville owned and controlled not only the grounds and build- 
ings referred to in the resolution quoted above, but a medical 
college, and what was known as the Montgomery Bell Academy, 
which were all under the control of the University of Nashville; 
and the Chancellor elected or selected was to be the head of the 
combined schools, while the President of the Normal College 
was to be the head of the school embraced in the sixteen acres of 
land, buildings, etc., referred to in the resolution cited above. 
The resolution of the University of Nashville nowhere states 
who shail elect the officers and teachers of these schools, but we 
find that the right of the Peabody Board of Trust to select the 
President has not only been exercised by it, but its right has 
_ never been questioned ; and that the President thus selected and 
recognized has from time to time made such changes as he 
19
-P-A-G-E-307
= 290 — 
thought best, and his action, where any action thereon appears 
to have been taken, has been. approved by not only the Board of 
Trustees of the University of Nashville, but by the State Board 
of Education; and we are, therefore, of the opinion that the 
State Board of Education has no power in the selection of either 
the officers or teachers of the schools, and that where it has ap- 
peared to ratify or confirm the actions of the Chancellor or Pres- 
ident, it has been at most an assumption of power without legal 
authority, which was acquiesced in by the other boards. And 
this opinion expresses the view of the Peabody Board of Trust, 
as evidenced by un excerpt from a letter by ex-Governor Porter 
to John M. Bass, Secretary and Treasurer of the University 
Board, in which he says: 
“The members of the University Board must know that 
the Peabody Board is in control. . . . The President of 
the Normal College has authority to employ teachers and to 
remove them. ” 
~ Your committee has thoroughly investigated the financial 
management of the institution. 
It has before it the report of the Legislative Investigating 
Committee, submitted to the last Legislature; the report of the 
Special Committee from the University Board, which investi- 
gated the college; and the report of the Auditing Committee of 
the State Board of Education. 
The committee also examined the expert accountants—R. 
T. Sweat, C. Flischer, and Frank Goodman—who investigated 
and reported upon the books and financial management of this 
institution last winter and last fall under the direction of these 
committees at different times. 
From these reports and the testimony of the expert account- 
ants, and especially the report of our own Auditing Committee, 
we are satisfied that our report of the finances of the institution 
is correct to a cent, and that every dollar appropriated by the 
State to this institution has been rightly applied and properly 
accounted for. 
We also took the testimony of Comptroller King and his chief 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
  aie a 
clerk, Mr. Trousdale, who state that the moneys appropriated 
by the Legislature have been regularly drawn from the treasury, 
and that vouchers are now on file in the Comptroller’s office for 
every dollar expended by the college from the State fund. These 
vouchers have been compared and audited, and there can be no 
mistake about the correctness of the Comptroller’s statement. 
The State Board of Education has. a right to presume that 
the Legislative Committee, after the investigation by the Uni- 
versity Board of the financial management of the school, and 
having before it the finding of that Board, had thoroughly inves- 
tigated and reported the facts. We believe that that Legislative 
‘Committee, composed of sworn officers of the State, should have 
reported all facts developed by it in its investigation. That 
committee had power to summon and compel the attendance of 
‘witnesses, and there is no reason why it could not find out all the 
facts, and we believe that the committee did report all that was 
warranted by its investigation. Representative W. B. Hender- 
‘son, who wrote the Legislative Committee’s report, says: 
“T desire to say that the entire results of that investigation 
by the committee appear in its report. I can neither add to nor 
take away from it.” 
The Legislative Committee investigated and reported upon 
‘the financial management of the institution under Dr. W. H. 
_ Payne, and commented upon the conduct of his Secretary, W. R. 
Payne. W. R. Payne, as Secretary, evidently managed the 
business in an irregular and indiscreet manner; and while the 
State did not lose a cent by his conduct of the affairs, we think 
the Legislative Committee was warranted in criticising him for 
his conduct and in demanding his resignation. We commend 
the wisdom of the Legislative Committee in asking his removal 
and in recommending the passage of a law—which was subse- 
quently done—taking the entire management and control of all 
moneys appropriated by the State out of the hands of any one 
connected with the college and having the same expended by a 
State official, who is required, by the Act of 1899, to give bond for 
_ the honest and faithful performance of his duty as Treasurer.
-P-A-G-E-309
aie 
This mismanagement of the financial affairs of that college 
by W. R. Payne, Private Secretary to his father, extended over a 
period of several months prior to the meeting of the last Legis- 
lature, as reported by the Legislative Committee. It was the 
duty of Dr. Payne, as President of the college, to look personally 
after the financial details in every department, and in failing 
to do so he has subjected himself to just and warranted criti- 
cism. 
The President of the college did not make his report to the 
State Board of Education for two years past, as required by law, 
and the neglect of duty by the State Board of Education in fail- 
ing to require said report did not excuse him for failing‘to dis- 
charge his duty. 
During the investigation of the office of Comptroller and 
Treasurer, and the investigation by the Legislative Committee 
of the Normal College, Frank Goodman was expert accountant 
and performed this examination for these committees, and has 
verified before this committee the findings of these committees. 
At the annual meeting of the State Board of Education, April 
29, 1899, Mr. Goodman and Captain Douglass, members of the 
Auditing Committee of that Board, submitted a report of the 
financial condition of the college, covering the entire period since 
the last meeting of the State Board of Education. This Audit- 
ing Committee’s report verified that made by the Legislature 
- up to the time of the Legislative Committee’s report, and the 
Auditing Committee also reported all moneys expended by the 
college since that time and until the meeting of the State Board. 
The Auditing Committee concluded its report by saying: 
“For the true balance of $5,921.16, on hand at final settle- 
ment with the Legislative Committee, the same is herewith sub- 
mitted to the Board, first, by receipted vouchers, Nos. 1164 to 
11938, amounting to $4,969.24; also cash, as per amount on de- 
posit, $951.92. 
“Said deposit, like accompanying vouchers, is presented and 
to be turned over to the Secretary and Treasurer of this Board, 
as provided by recently amended law. The cash balance of
-P-A-G-E-310
— 293 — 
$951.92, above referred to as the same as the balance shown on 
page 9 of cashbock of Peabody Normal College, is correct. 
“FRANK GOODMAN, Chairman; 
“CHARLES S. DOUGLASS, 
“Auditing Committee.” 
From this report, as from the Legislative Committee and 
the expert accountants heretofore examining the books, it will 
be seen that Dr. Payne has regularly drawn the money from the 
Treasury and has deposited with the Comptroller vouchers for 
all money so drawn and expended by him, except the $951.92, 
which was turned over by him to the new Treasurer of the col- 
_ lege fund. 
The Legislative Committee requested the removal of W. R. 
Payne, and we find that on the day that such request was made 
Chancellor Payne removed him, and that he has never occupied 
the place since that time. The Chancellor appointed in his place 
Ti. A. L. Purinton, who held that position until his recent death, 
when John M. Bass, of this city, who was also Secretary and 
Treasurer of the Board of Trustees of the University of Nash- 
ville, was appointed by the Chancellor to fill that vacancy, and 
has since been made the Secretary of the college. We find that 
since the removal of W. R. Payne no one has ever filled the posi- 
tion of Private Secretary to the Chancellor for a single day, ex- 
cept Dr. A. L. Purinton and John M. Bass, who alone have per- 
formed the duties of that office and drawn the salary therefor. 
The testimony shows that while W. R. Payne was Secretary to 
his father Mrs. W. R. Payne assisted him in. the office and 
was familiar with the books and papers in it, and that Dr. Purin- 
ton, when appointed to that office, knew nothing about the books, . 
papers, and accounts, and that he asked Mrs. W. R. Payne to as- 
sist him in familiarizing himself with them and in the discharge 
of his duties, which she did as an accommodation to him. This 
action was very unwise and necessarily subjected those in control 
to criticism, because Mrs. Payne, excellent woman as she is, is 
the wife of W. R. Payne, whose discharge was demanded by the 
Legislature.
-P-A-G-E-311
— 294 — 
The committee having required the removal of W. R. Payne, 
and the Legislature having subsequently passed an Act placing 
the funds appropriated by the State in the hands of a State 
official, the irregularities as shown by the Legislative Commit- 
tee’s report cannot again occur with this college, because no one 
connected with it will have anything to do with the expenditures 
of the funds. The mismanagement complained of by the Legis- 
lature cannot again occur, because every recommendation made 
by the committee has been complied with by the Legislature, the 
State Board of Education, and those in control of the college. 
Some years ago Lindsley Hall, situated on the Peabody 
campus, was not in a usable condition, and Dr. Payne requested 
the University Board to make such repairs on the hall as would 
make it suitable for use by the students; but the Board declined 
to do so because it had no funds with which to make the improve- 
ments, but authorized the Chancellor personally to make the im- 
provements, which he did, at his own expense. 
E. D. Hicks, deceased, the’ former Secretary and Treasurer 
of the University Board, speaking for the Board, assumed to 
authorize Chancellor Payne “ to apply the funds as you think 
proper.” Under this authority the Chancellor has made im- 
provements on the property, and with the rentals derived from 
it has expended $1,656.10 on furnishing the hall and in aiding 
indigent students who could not have otherwise attended the 
school. We find from his report to the University Board that 
he has now on hand $3,694.71 of this fund, subject to the dis- 
posal of that Board.’ This belongs to the University Board, or to 
the college, and not to Dr. Payne. The State has no possible in- 
terest in it, and this Board could not, if it attempted to do so, 
exercise any control or supervision over this fund. The disposi- 
tion of that fund found to be in the hands of Chancellor Payne 
is a matter entirely between him and the Board of Trustees of 
the University of Nashville. 
We find the incidental fund, which is subject to the control of 
some one or all of the boards, has been properly managed and 
applied, and all of it has been regularly accounted for.
-P-A-G-E-312
— 295 — 
Your committee has endeavored by its investigation to de- 
termine the reason for the removal of Professors Lampson and 
Penfield and Miss Doak. 
Miss Doak was employed in the bookstore, which was discon- 
tinued upon complaint of the Legislative Committee, and that 
left her without a position. The committee evidently thought 
that it was best for the institution to discontinue this bookstore, 
and the result of its comment and its criticism, as stated by 
Chancellor Payne and others, was the discontinuance of it, 
making vacant the place held by Miss Doak. 
All the evidence upon that subject. taken by this committee 
is conclusive upon the fact that there have been unpleasant rela- 
tions between the Chancellor and Professors Lampson and Pen- 
field for some years. The Chancellor, in his communication to 
the State Board of Education, said, in part: 
“Tt has been growing more and more evident for a number of 
years that some changes in the personnel of our faculty had be- 
come a necessity, and on more than one occasion I have been 
‘urged by one or more of the governing boards to make these 
changes. Several weeks ago I addressed a brief communication 
to Dr. Curry, stating that, in my opinion, the good of the college 
required the dropping of several names from the faculty list, and 
asking him whether such action would meet his approval. His 
prompt reply was as follows: 
“ «Washington, D. C., May 13, 1899.—My Dear Dr. Payne: 
Your letter of May 8 is before me. I feel sure that in dropping 
the persons mentioned yoti have, in the charitableness of your 
heart, delayed what the interest of the college required an earlier 
action upon. The college is a unit, and between the different 
members of the faculty there should be most cheerful codpera- 
tion. Loyalty to the head is an indispensable factor of success, 
especially when that head, as in this ease, contains all of the req- 
uisite qualifications for the high position. i 
“*With unabated confidence and regard, I remain, yours 
sincerely, J.T. M, CURRY?
-P-A-G-E-313
= 296 — 
“ A little later I addressed a similar inquiry to ex-Governor 
Porter, and from him I received the following immediate reply: 
_ “Paris, Tenn., May 16, 1899.—Dear Dr. Payne: Your 
letter of yesterday is received. The Peabody Board of Trust 
holds you responsible for the harmonious and successful con- 
duct of the Normal School; therefore, when a teacher proves 
to be inefficient or disagreeable to you, it is your duty to relieve 
him or her, and to provide for the college efficient instructors 
who are personally acceptable and agreeable to yourself. Sin- 
cerely yours, JAMES D. PORTER.’ 
“ Still later I received, through John M. Bass, Secretary of 
ihe University Board, the following message from ex-Governor 
Porter: 
“<The members of the University Board must know that the 
Peabody Board is in control, and that Dr. Payne’s action in re- 
moving these teachers will be approved. The President of the 
Normal College has authority to employ teachers and to remove 
them. Dr. Payne should give these people formal notice of the 
fact that their successors have been named, and announce their 
names and his authority for his action. Please advise him of 
this.’ 
“ These utterances, whether taken singly or collectively, are 
plainly mandatory in their purpose. In explicit terms they ex- 
press the wish and will of the Trustees of the Peabody Education 
Fund, and are evidently binding on me as the appointee and 
_ servant of the Peabody Board of Trust. Accordingly, on the 
26th inst., I sent a formal notice to Professors Penfield and 
Lampson that their official connection with the Peabody Normal 
College’had terminated, and informed Miss Julia A. Doak that, 
- as the closing of the bookstore had left her with nothing to do dur- 
ing the first semester and with very little during the second, I 
could do no less than declare her place vacant. You will bear in 
mind that several years ago you informally, but unanimously re- 
quested me to drop Professor Lampson from the faculty list. At 
that time I thought a large tolerance was a better policy, but I 
have since learned, to my sorrow, that your [the State Board’s] 
judgment in the case was far wiser than mine.”
-P-A-G-E-314
Tae 
Chancellor Payne evidently believed that he was authorized 
and directed in the above communications to make the changes 
announced. This committee, however, determined to know per- 
sonally and officially from the Peabody Board of Trustees 
whether or not the changes made by the Chancellor were contem- 
plated prior to the meeting of the last Legislature, and accord- 
ingly the Chairman of this committee, immediately after its ap- 
pointment, wrote a letter on behalf of the committee to Dr. J. L. 
M. Curry, General Agent of the Peabody Fund, and Hon. James 
~D. Porter, the Tennessee representative and member of said 
Board. The substance of the letter which the Chairman wrote 
them was that these removals had been made by the Chancellor, 
that it had been said that he was actuated in making the removals 
because of certain testimony given by them before the Legislative 
Investigating Committee, and these gentlemen were asked to re- 
ply and state whether or not the removals had been contemplated 
prior to the meeting of the Legislature, and whether or not the 
- legislative investigation had anything to do with the removals. 
The following telegram was received from Dr. Curry: 
“Narragansett Pier, R. I., August 16, 1899.—Hon. Mor- 
gan C. Fitzpatrick, Superintendent of Education, Nashville: 
The removal of professors by President Payne has been in con- 
templation for more than a year, with my approval. 
Jos. MS OURR YY 
The following letter was received from ex-Governor Porter: 
“ Paris, Tenn., August 13, 1899.—My Dear Sir: Your let- 
ter of yesterday is received. Dr. Payne has never been satisfied 
with the three teachers named, and for years he has intended 
their removal, and perhaps I am to some extent responsible for 
his failure to act. I was kindly disposed to all of them, and it 
was this disposition that caused my interference in their behalf. 
Several years ago I discussed with Dr. Payne the propriety of 
granting to Messrs. Penfield and Lampson an increase of salary. 
This brought up the discussion of his unsatisfactory relations 
with them. After this development I said to him that it was his 
duty to remove them at once, and I was disappointed at his fail-
-P-A-G-E-315
« — 298 — 
ure to announce the names of their successors. It is a fact, too, 
that one of the principal officials of the Peabody Board of Edu- 
cation has during several years past asked Dr. Payne: ‘ Why do 
you retain Penfield and Lampson?’ Miss Doak, I believe, 
would have been removed in 1892, but for a request to retain her 
made by E. D. Hicks, deceased, and myself; and if action had 
then taken place in her ease, I have reason to believe that Messrs. 
Penfield and Lampson would have been removed at the same 
time. 
“The removal of the teachers named was not. influenced by 
the testimony given by them before the Legislative Investigating 
Committee. The facts proven by them had been developed by a 
committee of the University Trustees appointed by myself, 
founded upon data furnished by W. R. Payne in September last, 
and these witnesses only repeated statements made by the expert 
accountants employed by this committee, and if there had been 
no Legislative Committee, the removals would have been made. 
“Tam very pleased to know that you apnreciate the growing - 
value and importance of the Peabody Normal College, under Dr. 
Payne’s administration. It has attained a great influence, an in- 
fluence that reaches every hamlet in the South. Dr. Payne is one 
of the dozen great educators of the United States, and I have no 
fear but that in the years to come he will make the school of 
which he is the honored head one of the dozen great schools of our 
country. Yours very truly, JAMES D. PORTER. - 
“To Hon. Morgan C. Fitzparick.” 
This committee is of the opinion that no higher authority 
should be asked and no better obtained than that furnished* in 
the telegram of Dr. Curry and in the letter of ex-Governor Porter, 
whose interest in the institution and whose integrity have not 
been, and cannot be, questioned. 
It therefore appears, from these communications and from 
other evidence before this committee, which is submitted to you, 
.that the removal of these professors was determined upon long 
before the Legislative Committee was appointed, and that their 
testimony before that committee had nothing whatever to do 
with their removal. é
-P-A-G-E-316

This committee has the highest regard for the Legislature of 
Tennessee, and especially the committee which investigated this 
institution. The Legislature of Tennessee is entitled to the ever- 
lasting gratitude of the people of the State and of the South for 
its generosity and patriotism manifested by its action toward 
this great institution. It certainly was not the purpose of that 
committee, and would not be of any succeeding Legislature, to 
promise immunity to professors who might testify before a legis- 
lative committee against their removal for causes which had ex- 
isted for years, and immunity against their removal when the 
three boards interested in the management of the school thought 
such removals were for the best interests of the institution. 
This committee commends the wisdom of the State Legislae \. 
ture in passing the Act of 1875, and that of the State Board of 
Edueation in codperating with the Board of Trustees of tl 
University of Nashville and the Peabody Board of Trust in s = 
curing the location in this city of this great institution. : 
In 1867 George Peabody, the great philanthronist, appoed 
Trustees and donated to them bonds amounting to $2,000,000, 
to be used by them for public education in the South. It was 
his desire that for thirty years thereafter the income only of 
those bonds should be used by the Trustees to aid public schools 
in the various States, and it was his desire also that this fund 
should be used for the benefit of the people of those States which 
had suffered most by the war. Accordingly, when this institution 
was located here, the Peabody Board of Trust provided that 
scholarships should be given to it and recognized by it from all 
the Southern States, except Kentucky, Missouri, and Maryland. 
It will thus be seen that while this institution is located in Nash- 
ville and in Tennssee, it is originally and distinctively a 
Southern institution, the property of all the Southern States, ex- 
cept the three named. Those States have the same interest, and 
should exercise it to the same extent as does Tennessee, with the 
exception that this institution is located within our borders and 
is supported in part by an appropriation from the State. This 
appropriation, however, was not made by the State until six 
years after the institution had been located here. By the ap-
-P-A-G-E-317
= 300 = 
propriation made by the State we do not get control or manage 
ment over this institution, and such appropriations were not so 
intended, so far as expressed in the Acts. Tennessee, as stated, 
has the same rights and privileges in this institution as have the 
other Southern States, and, in addition, has thirty-three scholar- 
ships to the institution. Hundreds of students from this State 
are educated free of tuition there; and, furthermore, it has the 
great benefit of the location of the institution in this State that 
brings to its capital city more than 600 nonresident students an- 
nually. There were assembled last session in the different depart- 
ments of this institution more than 900 students upon its cam- _ 
pus, spending in the city of Nashville more than $150,000 per 
year. 
An investigation of this institution makes a comparison of — 
statistics very gratifying to those interested. At the close of the 
first term of the school, in 1875, it had in all departments sixty 
students; at the close of the May term, 1888, which was Chan- 
cellor Payne’s first year here, it had enrolled 177 students; at 
the close of the present term there were enrolled in the Peabody 
Normal College proper 604 students, and, including those at- 
tending the Winthrop Model School, which is its preparatory de- 
partment, there were enrolled more than 900 students. This 
enumeration does not include students attending the Medical 
College, the College of Music, nor the Montgomery Bell Acade- 
my, all of which, however, are under the jurisdiction, control, 
and management of the Chancellor of the University, and would 
show a total attendance of about 1,500 students. 
In view of discussions and publications in the newspapers 
criticising the management of this institution and commenting 
upon it, this committee felt it to be its duty to investigate fully, 
the character of the students attending the college and that of the 
people with whom they board, and the method of supervision em- 
ployed by the Chancellor with regard to the conduct of students 
and their places of living. We find that the highest type and 
most substantial class of young ladies and young gentlemen in 
the South attend this college. They are not representatives, in 
some cases, of the wealthier families of the South, but come from
-P-A-G-E-318
= 3801 — 
the honest, substantial common people. As a rule, the students 
attending this college are determined to secure an education, and, 
by their own individual efforts and energy, they have earned the 
money with which they pay their expenses in this school. They 
are the most earnest, energetic, and hopeful class of students in 
any college in the country. 
We have examined more than seventy-five of the best citizens 
. living around this college, who testified without hesitation to 
the fact that these students are of high character, and that they 
find their homes among the very best people of South Nashville 
—people whose honesty, integrity, and good morals are above 
suspicion and have never been questioned. The statement in the 
press that “the moral atmosphere around this college is bad” 
is a slander upon these students and the good people with whom 
they board. 
This committee is warranted in what it says here by the tes- 
timony of Mayor Dudley; Revs. George A. Lofton, W. T. Rodg- 
ers, and A. L. Phillips; Maj. W. T. Hardison, and seventy-five of 
the most substantial and respectable citizens of South Nashville. 
This committee feels it to be its duty to say this much on be- 
half of the thousands of students who are filling positions of hon- 
or and responsibility in the South, and who, during this investi- 
gation and at all times, have manifested with earnestness their 
love and veneration for this honored institution. 
Your committee respectfully recommends: 
1. That the State Board of Education adhere to its determi- 
nation in requiring from the President of the University a finan- 
cial statement every ninety days of all receipts and expenditures’ 
by him. } 
2. That the State Board of Education determine upon each 
item of expense, fix the amount of such expense, and direct the 
time and manner of all expenditures of the money appropriated 
by the State for this institution. 
8. There have never been any well-defined legal relations be- 
tween the three boards interested in the management of this col- 
lege, and the powers, duties, and responsibilities of each board
-P-A-G-E-319
Pa30n 
have never been defined or agreed upon. We therefore recom- 
mend that the State Board of Education appoint a committee 
of three to confer with a like committee that may be appointed 
from the Peabody Board of Trust and the Board of Trustees 
of the University of Nashville, and power conferred upon the 
three committees to confer, agree upon, formulate, and adopt a 
set of resolutions defining clearly the rights, duties, and responsi- 
bilities of said boards to this institution, and fix rules for its 
management and control in conformity with the legal status and 
rights of the respective boards, and that, if it shall be found nee- 
essary to accomplish the end in view, further legislation be 
had, and then, and in that event the Governor be requested to 
ecmmunicate that fact to the next Legislature, in order that the 
necessary steps may be had, by appropriate legislation, to carry 
into effect the plan of management agreed upon and found neces- 
sary to accomplish the end in view. 
4. This committee, being in doubt as to the legal authority of 
the State Board of Education to elect or dismiss teachers or 
otherwise exercise control over the faculty of the institution, and 
the State Board’s right and authority to so act being also denied 
by the Peabody Board, we recommend that the State Board of 
Education take no further action in this respect and refuse either 
to dismiss or confirm recommendations of the President as to 
any changes in the faculty, until a conference is had by the three 
beards, and such conference to be sought immediately. 
5. In the investigation rumors reflecting wpon the conduct of 
the Chancellor have come to the attention of this committee, and 
it has earnestly endeavored to ascertain their origin and authen- ~ 
ticity. In an examination of more than 100 witnesses, the com- 
mittee has been unable to find a single witness who would state 
personally a single act of impropriety or one which would reflect 
upon the Chancellor ; while, on the other hand, men of the highest 
cheracter, who have known him since his residence in Nashville, 
have testified to his high moral character and personal worth. 
With these facts before us, and with the unsatisfactory finan- 
cial management of the institution, as set forth in the Legislative 
Committee’s report and shown by this investigation, we respect-
-P-A-G-E-320
OUD 
fully request that the evidence taken by this committee, together 
with its report, be tendered to the Peabody Board of Trust, 
which alone has the power to act, and we submit to them the 
question of whether or not it is for the best interest of the institu- 
tion to continue at its head the President selected by the Peabody 
Board of Trust. MORGAN C. FITZPATRICK, 
THOMAS H. PAINE, 
CHARLES S. DOUGLASS. 
After the adoption of the report the following resolution was 
offered and unanimously passed by the State Board: 
“ Resolved, That the President of the State Board of Educa- 
tion be, and he is hereby, authorized to request and appoint a 
committee of three, of which the President shall be a member, to 
confer with a like committee, whose appointment is asked for, 
from the Peabody Educational Board and the University Board 
of Nashville; that this committee be instructed to notify the. 
other boards of our action and request that they appoint a com- 
mittee for a conference at their earliest convenience, in order 
that the legal status of each board may be determined and a plan 
for the future management of the institution be adopted.” 
In pursuance of the above resolution, Governor McMillin, Su- 
perintendent Fitzpatrick, and Prof. H. D. Huffaker were 
appointed a committee to confer with a like committee from the 
other two governing boards. The committee met on November 
20, 1899, with Bishop Whipple, Dr. J. L. M. Curry, ex-Governor 
Porter, of the Peabody Board ; and Sam. Watson, J. M. Bass, and 
ex-Governor Porter, of the University Board. The conference 
was had and the members were in every way harmonious. A 
committee was appointed, and the following report was wnani- 
mously adopted : 
“The undisturbed harmony among the three boards repre- 
sented in this joint committee, which has existed from the origin 
and establishment of the Peabody Normal College, is most grati- 
fying, and has proved beneficial to the college and promotive of 
its great prosperity. In order to maintain this commendable 
_ relation and to prevent any possible friction or misunderstanding
-P-A-G-E-321
  304 — 
in the future, and to preserve this useful and cordial relation and 
codperation, it is, therefore, recommended to the three boards 
that the general agent of the Peabody Educational Fund, the 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction for Tennessee, and 
the President of the Board of Trustees of the University of 
Nashville, shall be an Advisory Committee, with power to act and 
to confer with the President of the Peabody Normal College in 
any and all matters by them deemed necessary relating to the 
future management and control of the college. 
“ The University of Nashville, through its Board, has already 
transferred the college buildings and grounds to the Peabody 
Board of Trust; the State Legislature has placed in the hands 
of a State official the management and distribution of all moneys 
appropriated by the State; while the Peabody Board of Trust 
has its own channels through which all money, so generously do- 
nated by it, are to be expended. We are satisfied that this agree- 
ment and arrangement is for the best interests of the institution, 
and recommend that it be continued. Respectfully submitted, 
“J. L. M. CURRY,

  OFFICIAL CIRCULARS. 
STATE OF TENNESSEE, 
Department oF Pusric Insrrucrion, 
Nashville, April 12, 1899. 
Dear Sir: For a number of years the Legislature has appro- 
priated $1,500 per annum for summer Institute work, and the 
Peabody Board has given, in addition, $1,200 per annum. The 
Peabody Board, however, will not give this or any other amount 
unless the Legislature makes an appropriation. The State Pub-. 
lic School Officers’ Association unanimously adopted a resolu- 
tion asking that the Legislature appropriate $2,500 per annum 
for this purpose, which, with a better sum given by the Peabody 
Board, would enable us to do all necessary work in the Summer 
Normal Institutes in every portion of the State. We spend 
annually more than $2,000,000 for public schools in this State, 
and the appropriation of $2,500 annually out of this fund for 
Institute work will not stop the schools of the State one hour. 
I know you agree with me that the money spent in this way will 
be of more value to the teachers, to the pupils, and to the State 
than any other of corresponding amount. Please aid in securing 
this appropriation by impressing its importance upon your Sen- 
‘ators and Representatives. 
Yours very truly, 
MORGAN C. FITZPATRICK. 
State Superintendent.

‘To County and City Superintendents: 
T respectfully call your attention to the law contained in the 
“Code, Sections 326 to 331, inclusive (copy inclosed), with regard 
to examinations for free State Scholarships in the University of 
Tennessee. This law makes it your official duty to give due 
notice thereof and to hold such examinations as may be neces- 
sary. 2 
The blank form of notice inclosed should be at once inserted 
in all the local papers and published in all the schools. TI also 
inclose full explanations of the examinations and instructions 
for the examiners, with a sealed envelope containing the ques- 
tions, which are not to be opened until the time for the examina- 
tion. 
See also the Register of the University, pages 19-25. The 
examination should be fixed and announced at once, and had 
best be held at or near the close of the schools. Please acknowl- 
edge this and give me the date and place for the examination. 
Examination papers should be mailed direct to the Registrar, 
University of Tennessee, Knoxville. 
Yours very truly,

Regulations Governing the Examination and Certification of 
Public School Teachers by the Gounty Superintend- 
ents of Public Instruction. 
  
THE Law. 
It shall be the duty of the State Superintendent “ to prescribe 
the mode of examining and licensing school-teachers, and their 
Necessary qualifications.” (Section 7, Subsection 9.)
-P-A-G-E-345
— 328 — 
Tt shall be the duty of the County Superintendent “ to per- 
form such duties in relation to the examination of teachers, and 
issuing to them certificates of qualification, as may be required 
of him by the State Superintendent.” (Section 9, Subsection 4.) 
“To observe such directions and regulations as the State Su- 
perintendent of Schools may from time to time prescribe.” 
(Section 9, Subsection 6.) 
“No teacher of public schools shall be employed, or receive 
any pay from the public funds, unless he or she have a certificate 
of qualification, given to him or her by the County Superintend- 
ent for the county within which he or she is employed.” (See 
tion 26.) : 
“ Diplomas shall be granted to those who honorably complete 
the course of study prescribed in Normal schools established 
by the State Board cf Education, and possession of such diploma 
shall exempt the holder thereof from the examination prescribed 
as a condition precedent to employment in the public schools of 
the State, any such graduate being eligible as a teacher in any 
county of the State.” (Section 54, Subsection 8.) 
REGULATIONS OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION, 
Under authority of the State Board of Education, the Pea- 
body Normal College, at Nashville, and the Teachers’ Training 
School, at Hiwassee College, issue certificates and diplomas to 
graduates, which exempt the holders from examination before 
the County Superintendents. 
“Parties holding Roll of Honor Certificates issued by the 
State or Peabody Institutes shall Be exempt from examination 
for Teachers’ Certificates, in any of the counties in the State; 
provided that no certificate hereafter issued by any such Insti- 
tute, or Conductor thereof, shall be good for a period exceeding 
four years from date of issuance.” (Minute Book, 1899.) 
Heretofore Life Certificates have been issued, exempting 
teachers from further examination; but the above action of the 
State Board means that Life Certificates are forbidden, and that. 
all who stand examinations this or any succeeding year shall 
be granted certificates which will expire four years from date,
-P-A-G-E-346
1829 — 
instead of for life. This ruling does not interfere with parties 
now holding Life Certificates. 
“All persons who are exempt from examination for Teachers’ 
Certificates by authority of the State Board of Education shall 
conform to the requirements of the State Superintendent as to 
the time when said persons shall make application to the County 
Superintendent for Teachers’ Certificates.” (Minute Book, 
1895, page 29.) 
REGULATIONS OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT. 
Grades of Certificates. 
Three grades of Certificates shall be issued. 
First Grade Secondary Certificates are to be given to gradu- 
ates of the State Normal Colleges, of the State and Peabody 
Institutes, and to all who shall average in examination at least 
85 on the following subjects: 
Orthography, Reading, Writing, Mental Arithmetic, Written 
Arithmetic, English Grammar, Geography, History of Tennes- 
see, History of the United States, Physiology and Hygiene, Ele- 
mentary Geology of Tennessee, Elementary Principles of Agri- 
culture, Elements of Algebra, Elements of Plane Geometry, 
EJements of Natural Philosophy, Elementary Bookkeeping, 
Elements of Civil Government, Rhetoric; Theory and Practice 
of Teaching, and School Law. 
Second Grade Secondary Certificates are to be issued to appli- 
eants who average in examination at least 70 on the same sub- 
jects required for the First Grade. 
‘Third Grade Primary Certificates are to be given to those 
whose average is at least 85 on the subjects required to be tavight 
in the Primary schools, and in Theory and Practice of Teach- 
ing; and Primary Certificates, good for.one year, will be issued, 
without examination, io applicants who have completed the 
course of study for the first. year in any State or Peabody Insti- 
tute; provided that such certificates shall not be issued, with- 
out examination, after one year from the time such State or Pea- 
body Institute was held. Examinations for Primary Certifi- 
¢ates shall be held on the following subjects:
-P-A-G-E-347
— 330 — 
Orthography, Reading, Writing, Mental Arithmetic, Written 
Arithmetic, English Grammar, Geography, History of Tennes- 
see, History of the United States, Physiology and Hygiene; The- 
ory and Practice of Teaching, and School Law. 
TIMES OF EXAMINATIONS. 
County Superintendents are requested to hold public exami- 
nations at the following times, and to give no private examina- 
tions: 
Annual Examination—First Friday and Saturday in July. 
Second Examination—First Friday and Saturday in August. 
Quarterly Examination-—First Friday and Saturday in Octo-_ 
ber. 
Quarterly Examination—First Friday and Saturday in Janu- 
ares: 
Quarterly Examination — First Friday and Saturday in 
March. 
All certificates expire at the close of the scholastic year, June 
30. 
Instructions are hereby given to issue no certificate to any 
applicant—graduate of any State Normal College, State or Pea- 
body Institute, except at the dates above specified. If the two _ 
days named are not sufficient to conclude the examination of ap- 
plicants, continue from day to day until the work is finished. 
Have your examinations on these dates, and no other. Let 
them be uniform. Under no circumstances hold individual or 
private examinations. One whole day, at least, is necessary for 
the Primary examination, and it will require two whole days for © 
a satisfactory examination for the Secondary Course. Treat 
all teachers with absolute justice, fairness, and impartiality. 
This can be done by fixing the time for examination, the place, 
the number of hours to be consumed, and making no exception 
for or against any person or teacher. I recommend a strict, 
thorough, practical, and uniform examination on all the branches 
us prescribed by law. You haye no right to license any person 
‘to teach school who is not worthy and well qualified and of the 
highest moral character and personal worth. License no others, 
it matters not what their examinations may be.
-P-A-G-E-348
—331— 
‘A Teachers’ Institute should be held in each county, and every 
teacher in the county, whether exempt from examination or not, 
should be encouraged to attend. It is recommended that these 
Tnstitutes be held so as to close on the first Friday and Raimnday, 
in July, the date of the annual examination. 
The best teachers usually attend County Institutes. I, there- 
fore, recommend that those teachers in your county who attend - 
regularly your County Institutes and Teachers’ Meetings be 
given due credit for the same by you in your annual examina- 
tion for Teachers’ Certificates. 
TEACHERS EXEMPT FROM EXAMINATION, 
1. Graduates of the Peabody Normal College. 
2. Graduates of the Teachers’ Training School at Hiwassee © 
College. 
5. Graduates of State and Peabody Institutes. 
You should examine all applicants for certificates, except 
those expressly enumerated herein. The fact that a teacher is 
a graduate of some school or college does not free him from ex- 
aiination. Examinations are no hardship upon thoroughly 
- qualified teachers, and you have no other way under the law to 
test the teacher’s fitness and ability, except by an examination. 
Examine applicants for First Grade and Second Grade cer- 
tificates, not exempt from such examination, in Theory and 
Practice of Teaching, and School Law; and applicants for Third 
Grade certificates, in ‘Theory and Practice of Teaching. A 
public school certificate is not a license to teach school, neither 
is a public school diploma. Do not issue a certificate to an in- 
competent person, no matter what pressure may be brought to 
bear. Use every means possible to improve the teachers of your 
respective counties. Urge upon them the value of attending 
Institutes, reading school journals and professional literature. 
Start a Teachers’ Library, if one has not already been estab- 
_lished, and encourage Reading Circles.

To County Superintendents: 
By authority of the State, I have located State Normal Insti- 
tutes for the teachers of the respective Grand Divisions, with 
Tnstructors, at the following times and places: 
Union City, Monday, June 5; four weeks. 
Conductor: Dr. J. I. D. Hinds. 
Instructors: J. L. Brooks, J. W. Sewell, W. H. Cook. 
Dickson, Monday, June 5; four weeks. 
Conductor: 8. A. Link. 
Instructors: P. L. Harned, Fred. J. Page, T. B. Loggins. 
McMinnville, Monday, June 12; four weeks. 
Conductor: W. R. Garrett. 
Instructors: J. H. McCallie, K. W. Kennedy, W. N. Bil- 
lingsley. 
Jackson, Monday, June 12; four weeks. 
Conductor: G. R. MeGee.

Conductor: S. G. Gilbreath. 
Instructors: R. L. MeDonnold, W. M. Graybill, Price 
Thomas. 
Greeneville, Monday, July 3; four weeks. 
Conductor: C. 8. Douglass. 
Instructors: A. D. Wharton, L. S. London, W. W. Matney. 
_ These Institutes will be continued four weeks, and the work 
will be thorough and practical. All teachers who attend and 
stand satisfactory examination in the entire course will be 
granted a Roll of Honor Certificate, which will free them from 
examination by the County Superintendent for four years. 
I very much desire the largest possible attendance of teachers : 
in all the State Institutes, because I know that the work there 
will more than pay them for the time and money expended. I _ 
suggest that you have your County Institute at such time, either
-P-A-G-E-350
— 333 — 
before or after the State Institute near you, as not to conflict 
with its work. I know that many of your teachers will desire to 
attend the four-weeks’ Institute, and I hope that you will so 
arrange your county work that they may attend either or both. 
I suggest this, not in the spirit of interference in your local mat- 
ters, but because I believe it will suit your teachers and better 
aid the work of both Institutes. 
Yours very truly,

Please notify all your eolored teachers, and urge them to at-

Normal Institute should be granted a certificate to teach school 
in your county for a period of one year from the time of such

ductor of such State Institute. In addition to this, yeu will 
please renew such primary certificates for a period of one year 
for all teachers in good standing who present to you a certificate 
or statement from the Conductor of a State Institute that such 
~teacher has, since the receipt of a primary certificate, taken all 
or a part of the Secondary Course of Study in the State Institute.

STATE OF TENNESSEE, ” 
Department or Pustic Lysrruction, 
Nashville, August 8, 1899, 
To County Superintendents: 
It is your duty to look personally and particularly after the 
finances of your county so far as the expenditure affects the pub- 
lic school fund. All the work of trustees in the distribution of 
public school funds, and that of directors in expending the same, 
is directly under your supervision. 
Section 19 of the Publie School Law provides that “no di- 
rector shall be a teacher in the public school of his district, nor 
take any contract for building a schoolhouse in his district, nor 
any contract which this Board is competent to make, nor become 
the owner of a school warrant.” 
T call your especial attention to this law, and it is your duty to 
‘see that it is complied with. The law does not prohibit directors 
from employing to teach in the public schools persons related to 
them by either affinity or consanguinity. Complaints are made, 
however, in almost every county in Tennessee that directors con-
-P-A-G-E-352
=> 630 
tinually and persistently employ their sons and daughters, in 
many places without regard to their qualifications, to teach in 
their district. While the law does not prohibit this, you should 
use every effort to discourage this practice in your county. No 
good has ever come from it, and in many instances teachers and 
schools are unsuccessful on account of it. Tt will be much bet- 
ter for those who are related to the directors to either obtain a 
school in another district, have the director to resign, or refuse 
to teach school until employment can be had and the position 
obtained upon the teacher’s fitness and capacity alone. 
Yours very truly, 
MORGAN ©. FITZPATRICK,

To County Superintendents and Public School Teachers: 
Section 56 of the Public School Laws makes it the duty of the 
County Superintendent to designate some day in November as 
“Arbor Day ” for the public schools of the State. I respectfully 
suggest that you appoint I'riday, November 17, next. I am not 
authorized to fix the day and manner of this celebration, but sug- 
gest this date in order that every school in Tennessee may, on the 
same day, plant trees about the schoolhouses of the State. It 
adds to their comfort, renders them more beautiful, and is ever 
an indication of refinement and culture, and the day’s work well 
done will merit and receive the grateful commendation of those 
who succeed us. 
‘ T hope that “Arbor Day ” will be appropriately observed with 
songs, exercises, and the planting of trees by the hundreds of 
thousands of boys and girls attending the public schools of Ten-

substantial and permanent improvement.

To County Superintendents: 4 
In many counties of the State the public schools will soon 
close, and you should require all teachers to make out and sub- 
init to you their abstracts, as required by law, before they receive 
compensation for their last month’s services. You should also 
require them to return to you, at the close of this term, the 
Primary and Secondary Registers which you have furnished. 
The Legislature only makes a limited appropriation for printing 
of this character, and it is important that you keep all supplies 
which I have sent you carefully, and economize wherever possi- 
ble in their use. Most of the registers and record books fur- 
nished from this department this year can be easily used by 
teachers of your county during succeeding terms of school. If 
you will remind your teachers that such records are paid for at 
public expense, and that they are the property of the State, they 
will no doubt turn them over to you to be given by you to their 
successors. I desire to furnish the schools of the State with all 
necessary printed blanks, ete., and I hope to have your codpera- 
tion in making the best and most economical use of them possible.

     PUBLIC SCHOOL OFFICERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
The twelfth annual session of the Tennessee Public School 
Officers’ Association was called to order in the auditorium of 
the Tulane Hotel at 10 o’clock Tuesday morning, January 17, 
with Superintendent A. H. Wright, of Nashville, presiding, and 
Prof. Frank Goodman, of Nashville, as Secretary. 
_ The meeting was opened with prayer by Dr. John Mathews, 
pastor of McKendree Church. 
Hon. Price Thomas, State Superintendent of Public Instruc- 
tion, was on the programme to deliver the address of welcome, 
but had been called home the evening before, on account of sick- 
ness in his family, whereupon Hon. Morgan C. Fitzpatrick, the 
newly-appointed State Superintendent, was sent for, and, without 
any time for preparation, delivered an interesting and appropri- 
ate address of welcome. 
Prof. W. E. Stephens, of Dayton, responded to the address of 
welcome. 
President Wright called Mr. Fitzpatrick to preside while he 
delivered the annual address, 
On motion of Secretary Goodman, the President’s address was 
referred to a committee, composed of W. E. Lumley, Fred. J. 
Page, and J. G. Stinson, for consideration and report upon the 
vecommendations contained therein. 
Prof. W. E. Lumley, of Columbia, offered the following reso- 
lution: 
Resolved, That we, the Superintendents and other school officials 
composing the Public School Officers’ Association of Tennessee, hereby 
commend Governor McMillin and tender him our thanks for appointing: 
to the office of State Superintendent of Public Instruction so able and 
well qualified a man as Hon. Morgan Fitzpatrick. 
That we congratulate the State on securing him to be at the head 
5 of the public school system, and we feel assured that with him in office 
a better day for the schools is at hand. 
That we pledge to Superintendent Fitzpatrick the sincere and hearty 
“support and codperation of every member of this Association.

On motion of Supt. T. T. Hardy, the President appointed

tions relative to the death of Supt. W. A. Tanner, of Daneyville, 
the Vice President of the Association: W. R. Garrett, G. R. 
McGee, W. E. Stephens, P. W. Dodson, and Claude J. Bell. 
The various subjects to be discussed before the Association 
were announced to be in the hands of special committees. 
Professor Goodman, Secretary, called a roll of the committees, 
and. the places of the absentees were filled by the new county 
Superintendents, who had been elected since the programme was 
made up. 
The various committees were organized and it was announced 
that parlors B and C of the Tulane had been set aside for com- 
mittee work. 
The Association then adjourned until 2 P. M. 
TUESDAY AFTERNOON SESSION. 
The Association reconvened at 2 o’clock. 
The roll call by counties was taken up, and the entire after- 
noon session was consumed in five-minute reports by city and 
county Superintendents, many of the reports being warmly dis- 
cussed. The reference to charging teachers $1 for examination 
by county Superintendents precipitated a heated discussion, in 
which twenty-four members took part, and before the discussion 
was concluded, a motion was carvied postponing further debate. 
The verbal reports of Superintendents at the annual meetings 
give the Association the benefit of the experience and most. re- 
cent results accomplished by the Superintendents, and in a large 
measure form the basis for the deliberation and action of the As- 
sociation during its session, thereby enabling it to recommend to 
the Legislature the amendment or adoption of such laws as the 
most recent experience and conclusion of the Public School Offi- 
cers, in annual session, may suggest or recommend. 
In fact, the five-minute responses to the roll call, by Superin- 
tendents, is, in itself, in the nature of an educational experience 
meeting.

WEDNESDAY MORNING SESSION. 
  
The State Public School Officers’ Association met again in the 
Tulane assembly room at 10 o’clock Wednesday morning. 
The opening prayer was offered by Prof. W. E. Stephens. 
The roll call of counties and cities, which was begun on Tues- 
day afternoon, was resumed, and a number of Superintendents of 
city and town schools reported. 
The subject “ Siiould there be an Amendment to the State 
Constitution, enabling districts to tax themselves for school pur- 
poses #”? was, upon recommendation of the cemmittee, adopted, 
after being discussed by Miss Flora Fitzgerald, R. L. McDonald, 
W. F. Albright, J. W. Huey, W. R. Garrett, and G. R. McGee. 
“ Shall County Superintendents be Examined Biennially ?” 
was reported upon for adoption by the Committee having the sub- 
ject in charge, but was referred to the Committee on Laws, and 
upon its recommendation the report was tabled, leaving the law as 
it heretofore stood. Twenty-four members entered into the dis- 
cussion of this subject. 
Supt. H. C. Weber, of Nashville City Schools, invited the As- 
-gociation to visit the schools before adjournment. The invitation — 
was accepted. : 
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON SESSION. 
  
The Association convened at 2 o’clock, and the subject of 
“State Institutions,’ which had been made the special order 
for this hour, was taken up as follows: 
Chancellor W. H. Payne reported the gratifying progress and
-P-A-G-E-361

development of the Peabody Normal College, and its successful — 
work in training teachers for the educational work of the State. — 
Supt. John V. Armstrong thoroughly explained how the Ten- — 
nessee School for the Blind was the department of the public 
school system for all children of the State who were either blind - 
or had serious defective eyesight. ; 
- Capt. W. R. Garrett, Principal of Watkins Institute, ex- — 
plained how this institution was the public school night. class 
for those who labored, or who were employed during the day, 
the ages not being limited, the class being made up not only of 
small boys and girls, but also of grown men and women. 
Prof. Geo. F. Mellen, of Knoxville, in the absence of Dr. 
Chas. H. Dabney, the President, presented the report of the 
University of Tennessee. Prof. Mellen most thoroughly and _ 
satisfactorily explained the connection with the publie school 
system of the State, and also the numerous departments of the 
University, contributing much valuable information which will 
be of material assistance to the city and county Superintendents 
of the State. 
NOTE—More full and complete reports from these institutions will 
be found in the State Superintendent’s report for 1899. = 
The committee to whom the President’s address was referred _ 
recommended as follows: 
“1. We heartily indorse the sentiments of zeal and earnest- 
ness and patriotism therein contained, and are encouraged to 
make greater efforts for the cause of popular education. We 
believe, as rec~mmended in your address, that it is the impera 
tive duty of this Association to take some action looking toward 
the appointment in each county of a body whose duty it shall 
be to adopt a series of books for the exclusive use in the schools 
of that county. 
“2. We heartily indorse the recommendation that every 
County Superintendent in the State shall hold a County Teach- 
ers’ Institute of at least one week in each year. ;

The session was opened with prayer by Prof. J. ¥. Bailey.

The Executive Committee presented a resolution asking the - 
Legislature to amend the school laws so as to allow teachers or 
school officers to write, edit, or publish text-books, maps, or charts 
for which they shall receive such compensation as the market 
affords. This was adopted. 
The reading of reports was resumed and the first called was 
“Institutes, State and County—How Can Their Work Be Made 
More Effective?” S. G. Gilbreath read the report of the com- 
mittee recommending that the appropriation for such Institutes 
be increased from $1,500 to $2,500; that the time of holding 
State Institutes be arranged so as not to conflict with County In- 
stitutes, and that no certificate be issued for longer than five 
years. The report was adopted. 
The Committee on Compulsory Education submitted the fol- 
lowing report: “ 
“ The committee assigned this question do not report in favor 
of compulsory education in Tennessee. They do not believe the 
time isripe for such a law—if, in fact, such a time shall ever come 
in this State. Our people rightly believe in the largest measure 
of individual liberty, and that the welfare of the child and his 
control rightly belong to the parent, and not to the body politic. 
‘They are opposed to a. system of schools that is Spartan or Prus- 
sian in its character. We believe that the natural affection im- 
planted by Providence in the heart of the parent for his child 
will give to it.its best guardianship. We believe that the head 
of the family can best look to the interest of the children, and 
that we should resist the encroachments of the State upon home 
control. 
“We believe that for the education of the children we should 
not look to a paternal and centralizing law, full of police powers 
and regulations, but rather depend upon an enlightened public 
conscience, the attractiveness of the schools, and the moral influ- 
ence and toil of the teachers. We should not, like Mohammed, 
seek to promulgate our educational creed with the sword of com- 
pulsory law; but rather, like the Christ, offer and appeal, but not 
ecerce.”
-P-A-G-E-364
—345— -. 
An amendment was offered by Frank Goodman, pledging the 
indorsement of the Association to the child-labor law—not, how- 
ever, until after a heated debate of more than an hour, during 
which Supt. T. C. Gordon, who read the report, earnestly con- 
tended for its adoption, without amendment. 
J. G. Ford, Frank Goodman, and P. L. Harned epee the 
adoption of the report. 
Ex-Governor Buchanan, being called upon, opposed the report 
and favored making a man educate his children if he refused to do 
so voluntarily. He favored the enactment of the child-labor law. 
George F. Mellen, of the University of Tennessee, indorsed 
ex-Governor Buchanan’s views upon a compulsory educational 
law. 
Mrs. Lyde Thomas said under the right conditions she would 
favor compulsory education, but in Shelby County were such a 
law in force, the schools would be filled with negro children and | 
the school term would be reduced to six months. 
W. E. Lumiey opposed a compulsory educational law because 
it could not be enforced in Tennessee under present conditions. 
Capt. C. S. Douglass opposed a compulsory law on the ground 
that it would be an infringement upon the liberty of the people. 
The report, as amended, was adopted by a vote of 18 to 11. 
The Committee on Petition of School Directors of Ruther- 
ford County submitted the following report: 
“We, your committee, appointed to consider the petition of the 
directors of Rutherford County, requesting the codperation of 
this Association in urging the Legislature to grant to the several 
County Courts of the State the power to establish and maintain 
High Schools, have the honor to report as follows: 
“ We have conferred with Miss Jeannette M. King, County Su- 
“perintendent of Rutherford County, who has explained to us 
the memorial which will be presented to the Legislature by the 
directors and citizens of Rutherford County, and we have also 
considered letters from prominent citizens of the county. 
Your committee are of the opinion that the action of the direct- 
ors and citizens of Rutherford County is timely and wise, and
-P-A-G-E-365
— 346 — 
we recommend that this Association codperate cordially in the 
movement. Soe 
_In order to formulate the views of this Association, your com- 
mittee have prepared the following memorial to the Legislature, _ 
and we recommend that the same be adopted by the Association, 
and that duplicate copies be prepared, duly certified by the sig- 
natures of the President and Secretary, and be placed in the 
hands of the Committee on Schoo] Laws, to be by them presented — 
‘to the Senate and House of Representatives.

THURSDAY AFTERNOON SESSION. 
\   
The Association reconvened at 2 o’clock. Prof. Frank Good- 
man was called to the chair. 
COUNTY SUPERVISION. 
  
The Committee on County Supervision recommended increase 
of salaries of teachers. Either the State law should make defi- 
nite requirements of County Superintendents, or the State Su-_ 
perintendent should be authorized to prescribe and enforce same. 
More professional knowledge and training should be required of 
County Superintendents. The report was adopted without dis- 
cussion. 
: The Committee on Resolutions, composed of Superintendents 
P. L. Harned, Fred. J. Page, and F. M. Bowling, presented the 
following, which were unanimously adopted : = 
We, your committee on Resolutions, respectfully submit the follow- — 
ng: 
: Pee Hon. Price Thomas, State Superintendent of Public Instruc- : 
tion, has been prevented from meeting with us on account of the illness — 
of his wife: z 
Resolved, That we sympathize with Hon. Price Thomas, our State
-P-A-G-E-366
  — 347 — 
Superintendent, in the affliction of his family, and that we highly appre- 
ciate every effort that he has made in the upbuilding of the schools of 
the State. 
Resolved, That we thank the efficient editor of the Southwestern 
Journal of Education for the courtesies shown this Association in the 
publication of the programme and other articles in the interest of pub- 
lic schools and for his zeal and energy as Chairman of the Executive 
Committee. 
Resolved, further, That we tender our thanks to Superintendent A. 
H. Wright, President, and Frank Goodman, Secretary, for the faithful 
and patient discharge of their respective duties. 3 
Resolved, That we also offer our thanks to the Tulane Hotel for the 
use of the Auditorium and for other courtesies, and to the press of 
_ Nashyille, the American and the Banner, for printing our deliberations. 
Resolved, That the special thanks are due to Hon. Jno. H. Allen, ex- 
President of this Association, both for his faithful service in behalf of 
this Association, during the many years he was a member of the same, 
and also for efficient assistance given while serving as Chairman of the 
Educational Committee during the last session of the General Assem- 
bly, and we appreciate his attendance at this meeting. 
Resolved, That this Association is gratified at the attendance at its 
meetings of Hon. Jno. P. Buchanan, and his kind expressions in favor 
of education, which we regard as a manifestation of his continued in-~ 
terest in the cause of education, which, during his administration as 
Governor, he did much to promote. 
The follownig resolutions, offered by various members, were 
also adopted: 
By Superintendent F. K. Henderson: 
Resolved, That the By-laws and Constitution of this Association be 
so ainended that, beginning with the next regular meeting, all the offi- 
cers be nominated in open session, instead of being recommended by 
-the Executive Committee. 
By Miss Flora Fitzgerald: 
Resolved, That the Executive Committee be, and are hereby, re- 
quested to arrange for a special session of city Superintendents, in con- 
junction with the regular meetings of this Association. Also, that here- 
after the morning sessions be devoted to general business, discussion 
and adoption of reports, etc., and that the afternoon sessions be de- 
‘voted exclusively to committee work.   
_ By Superintendent Samuel Hixson: 
Be it resolyed, 1. That not more than one secondary school shall be 
- established in each district. 
2. That no secondary school shall be established with less than two 
_ teachers. 
 
-P-A-G-E-367
3. That all teachers will be required to attend the monthly teachers’ 
meetings while schools are in session. 
4, That the former regulations of ex-State Superintendent Gilbreath 
be made a law. The regulations provide that five regular examinations 
of teachers shall be held each year—viz., July, August, October, Janu- 
ary, and April. 
5. That the committee be requested to use its influence in making it 
compulsory that vocal music be taught in the schools of the State, 
the law to take effect two years after its passage. 
A most appropriate resolution reported by the special com- 
mittee, was, by rising vote, unanimously adopted, relative to the 
death of Supt. W. A. Tanner, Vice President. It was a most 
beautiful tribute to the memory of one who had for years been a 
faithful attendant and earnest worker at the meetings of the As- 
sociation, and whose efficient and personal life had won the con 
fidence and affection of all his associates. 
The Executive Committee reported the following nominations 
as officers of the Association for the ensuing year, and they were 
all unanimously elected: 
President, P. L. Harned, Clarksville. 
Vice President, T. C. Gordon, Dyersburg. 
Secretary and Treasurer, Frank Goodman, Nashville. 
Executive Committee—Claude J. Bell, Chairman, Nashville; 
W. E. Stephens, Dayton; A. D. Breshear, Springfield; R. L. 
Bynum, Union City; Fred. J. Page, Triune. 
Retiring President A. H. Wright, thanked the Association 
for its cordial codperation. 
Capt. C. S. Douglass introduced President-elect Harned, who 
pledged his best efforts for the ensuing year. 
A committee was appointed to appear before the Legislature, 
in the interest of laws to be enacted, as recommended by the As- 
sociation, the committee consisting of Morgan CO. Fitzpatrick, W. 
R. Garrett, C. S. Douglass, S. G. Gilbreath, and H. C. Weber. 
The Association then adjourned until January 16, 1900. 
A. H. WRIGHT, President.

EVENING. 
Address by Dr. A. E. Winship, “The Accompanist in Educa- 
tion.” 
The features of the meeting were unquestionably President - 
Weber’s address, the two lectures by Dr. A. E. Winship, and the 
speech of Goy. Benton McMillin. These four addresses were an 
inspiration to every teacher that heard them, and an honor to 
the Association. The other papers on the regular programme 
were of more than ordinary merit. For once the programme 
was fully carried out, and the Association remained in session 
the entire time allotted instead of adjourning a day ahead, as 
has been too frequently done in former years. 
A most important feature was the warm welcome extended
-P-A-G-E-372

the visitors, not only by the management of Monteagle, but by 
every one on the mountain.

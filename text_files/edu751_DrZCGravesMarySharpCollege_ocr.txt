INTRODUCTION 
The world makes progress, being led on or 
lured on by its pioneers. But the world has 
often failed to give to these brave, lonely spirits 
the meed of praise which they so richly deserve, 
by reason of their anguish and travail of soul. 
Often when recognition of their service does 
come, it comes so late that the silent sufferer 
dies without knowing that his offering has been 
accepted. Thus, that which should have glad- 
dened and cheered the hard-pressed toiler while 
he struggled, has been written on his tomb- 
stone, or in some belated biography. 
These dauntless, intrepid spirits, who were 
seers, have read the deeper mysteries of their 
times, and have left the beaten paths of the 
confident multitude, and have “blazed new 
trails” through the trackless forests, untrod- 
den by the advanced surveyors and undisturbed 
by the sapper’s ax; thus marking out roads for 
(72
-P-A-G-E-9

the oncoming multitudes of civilization. A 
gifted son of song sang: 
‘Tis weary watching, wave by wave, 
And still the tide heaves onward ; 
We build, like corals, grave by grave, 
But pave a path that’s sunward. 
“We're beaten back, in many a fray, 
But newer strength we borrow, 
And where the vanguard camps to-day 
The rear will rest tomorrow.” 
Society owes a large debt to these brave pio- 
neers, and often large praise. We admire cour- 
age, we honor genius, we stand with bared brow 
in the presence of those sun-crowned seers, who, 
comprehending the present, and forecasting the 
future, leave the world’s populous thorough- 
fares, and going the way that the future must 
come, make new roads for human progress. 
What clear vision they seem to have, what 
self-reliance, what dauntless courage that they 
are able to hold on their course, when all the 
world leaves them to toil alone. 
WHERE IT TAKES A MAN 
“Any one can follow blindly in the surging, sweeping 
throng,
-P-A-G-E-10
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 9 
Pressing on without a leader, rushing aimlessly along; 
It is easy to go forward, if the rest are going too; 
You can do with zealous ardor what you see the others 
do. 
- But to leave the crowd behind you and to dare to stand 
alone 
And face the taunts of others and the truth and right 
to own; 
Standing firmly, though unaided, save by God’s al- 
mighty hand, 
Takes a man of righteous honor ’gainst the foe to make 
a stand.” 
Such a spirit and such a pioneer was Dr. Z. 
C. Graves. He was born at the dawn of a new 
era in education. His environment and his 
rearing were a challenge to his wisdom and to 
his powers. The world had long looked upon 
its women as providentially intended to occupy 
an inner circle within the social order. The 
sphere and function of the female of the race 
were considered so circumscribed, that her 
mental possibilities and training were looked 
upon as essentially different from “the sterner 
sex,” his majesty, the man. These ideas had 
come from some remote past, and were taken 
for granted. They were so deeply imbedded 
in the popular mind that any one, who should
-P-A-G-E-11
10 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
propose to change them, ran the risk of merci- 
less criticism and often persecution. The bane 
of progress is this “taking things for granted” 
that ought to be challenged and tested. Dr. 
Z. C, Graves was a man who did not take things 
for granted. His keen intellect, warmed by 
his broad sympathies, conceived opinions that 
would shock the people among whom he lived. 
But Providence would lend his wise aid at a 
crucial time in the life-work of this his chosen 
pioneer. In the first place, Dr. Graves was 
moved from among the people with whom he 
had been reared. This came at one of those 
growing periods that come to progressing souls. 
In the new West, he discovered his superior 
teaching ability—discovered it for himself, and 
to his patrons. Thus he gained confidence in 
his ability. Maturity had not become stale be- 
fore he was invited into another new field. 
He was called South. Here the soil was vir- 
gin. No precedents nor prejudices erected in- 
surmountable barriers across his new pathway. 
Here he would raise a new standard for the 
education of the daughters of his adopted land. 
He would open the fields of advanced education
-P-A-G-E-12
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 11 
for the women of the South, They should have 
the privileges of higher education. They should 
be fitted for association and companionship with 
the college and university-trained men, who had 
enjoyed educational advantages hitherto denied 
to their sisters. 
So, when the curriculum of Mary Sharp Col- 
lege was planned, it was intended to make it 
equal to and parallel with Brown University 
and other Eastern schools. The daughters of 
the South should enjoy equal advantages with 
their more fortunate brothers, and right here 
in the land of their birth. It is quite probable 
that this young philosopher and born teacher, 
who believed thoroughly in the native ability of 
the daughters of the land, would have hesitated 
to take so advanced a step alone. For he was 
naturally a timid soul, and by nature, a reti- 
cent man with no great amount of self-confi- 
dence. But he had a brother, Dr. J. R. Graves, 
who, although he was his junior, was himself 
a bold and intrepid crusader. He would dare 
any knightly deed. He never stopped to see 
whether any other knight would “lay lance in 
rest” to help him. He always went in to win.
-P-A-G-E-13
12 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
Whatever worthy cause needed a champion, 
found such in him. He was an orator of such 
captivating powers that as an advocate, he could 
carry any worthy cause before the people. He 
entertained the same high ideals concerning the 
education of women. Asa matter of fact, Dr. 
J. R. Graves was largely responsible for the 
advanced curriculum of Mary Sharp College. 
And that curriculum was. wrought out before 
his brother, Dr. Z. C. Graves, was elected Presi- 
dent of the college. 
Fortunately, this conception of the proper 
education for women met a cordial public ap- 
proval. Here is a striking illustration of a 
‘phenomenon of human history. It has had 
many striking examples in the world. Owen 
Meredith says that ‘Genius strikes the world 
at one point.” But great and important ideas 
strike the world at many points about the same _ 
time. Thus it so happens that different men 
are working on important and new ideas about 
the same time. If illustrations are sought, take 
for example, the electric telegraph, the radio, 
the telephone, the aeroplane. Put the names 
of Tesla and Marconi over against each other
-P-A-G-E-14
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 13 
—those of Graham and Bell—Wright and 
Langley. So, likewise, this idea of advanced 
education for the daughters of our country was 
being thought upon, in several schools, about 
the same time. The names of Wellesley, Vas- 
sar, Bryn Mawr and others are mentioned. But 
it is confidently believed that Mary Sharp an- 
ticipated them all. Careful inquiry brought 
out evidence of this. 
Mary Sharp was a great success, and marked 
the beginning of a new era in female educa- 
tion, not only in the South, but it spread to other 
parts of the country. It prepared a choice com- 
pany of chosen women who were to stand be- 
side their husbands, fathers and brothers in one 
of the most trying periods of history that ever 
‘came to any people, the “time of the Civil War, 
and the Period of Reconstruction.” Not only 
in those trying days, but ever they have been 
the finest of our incomparable Southern women. 
The writer has been called on to travel widely, 
throughout the South, in his denominational 
work. Having one of the Mary Sharp girls for 
his wife gave him wide “entre” into the homes 
of “Mary Sharpers.” It is but just, and will
-P-A-G-E-15
14 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
be allowed in this connection for him to say, - 
that without exception, he has found “the Mary 
Sharp Students” choice home makers. They 
take life seriously, but not gloomily. They have 
the culture and the spirit to make happy and 
prosperous homes, where husbands and chil- 
dren make beautiful the married life and its 
joyous accompaniments. They are among the 
choicest of church and society, wherever they 
are to be found. What a pity the dear old school 
had to. die. 
These “Mary Sharpers,” these that are left, 
and in whose hearts are stirred the tender and 
sacred memories of former days, and who yet 
delight to speak of themselves as “We Girls,” 
have long desired to pay some tribute of re- 
spect to the beloved teacher, and to enshrine his 
memory in some durable form, and have con- 
ceived the idea of this memorial volume. It 
has come late, to be sure, but if it is ever to be 
achieved, it must be done soon. For the num- 
ber is rapidly diminishing. And there are un- 
fortunately no successors. Mary Sharp, the 
dear old college, lived and loved and labored, 
and closed her doors, never to be reopened. For
-P-A-G-E-16
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 15 
every institution is ‘the lengthened shadow of 
some man,” and Dr. Graves left no successor. 
The circle is closed and growing smaller every 
year. Soon there will be no more meetings of 
the Mary Sharp College Club. It will be said 
of them as it was of the splendid “Alma 
Mater,” “College is closed, the books are put 
away, and the girls are gone home.” There 
will be no more sessions. But the benignant in- 
fluence of Mary Sharp will never die.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
Dr. Z. C. Graves was born April 15, 1816, 
in Chester, Vermont, a little village that nestled 
at the foot of Green Mountain. On his father’s 
side he was a descendant of a French Hugenot 
family, three sons of which sought refuge in 
America after most of the family had perished 
in the massacre of St. Bartholomew. It is said 
one brother moved down the Eastern Coast to 
Virginia, one went along the lake shore toward , 
the West, and the third, Calvin Zuinglius, the 
progenitor of the subject of this sketch, re- 
mained in New England. His mother was Lois 
Snell, daughter of Dr. Snell, a practicing phy- 
sician who labored in and around Chester, Ver- 
mont. Three children blessed this union, Zuing- 
lius Calvin, who was named for his father, a 
name that had been handed down by the family 
for generations; Louisa Maria, the late Mrs. 
W. P. Marks, of Nashville, Tennessee, and 
C17)
-P-A-G-E-19
18 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
James Robinson, the late J. R. Graves, of Mem- 
phis, Tennessee. 
“Zue,” as he was called, was about five years 
old when his father died, and James only two 
weeks old. The father was taken ill suddenly 
and lingered only a few weeks. He was a part- 
ner in a prosperous mercantile business, but af- 
ter his death this business was so mismanaged 
that nothing was left for the young widow and 
her three little ones except a cottage home. So 
she had to maintain herself and provide for her 
babes largely by her own exertion during the 
coming years. She was a woman of culture, of 
a remarkably bright mind and untiring energy. 
Mrs. Graves was at this time a member of the 
Congregational Church in Chester and we are 
told that it was her custom during those years 
to carry her three little ones with her not only 
to all of the church services, but to the prayer 
meeting as well, for she was a very devout 
spirit. It was during these years that she in- 
stilled into them the religious habits, love and 
reverence for God’s house that became the gov- 
erning principles of their lives in after years. 
It is also told us that it was her custom to teach
-P-A-G-E-20
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 19 
the children their letters and how to read at 
her knee, using the large family Bible, and that 
Bible was preserved and loved by them during 
their lifetime because of these precious mem- 
ories. / 
They also spoke often of the dear old deacon 
who always saw that the widow’s woodshed was 
supplied with wood ready for use and who often 
came to shovel out the paths for them after 
the heavy snowstorms. Most of all, they held 
in memory the dear old family physician who 
was a friend and advisor as well as a doctor, 
and helped to carry them through many trying 
experiences. 
In early life, Z. C. Graves was frail; he was 
troubled with a weak heart. He fainted easily 
so that he could not run and play like other 
children, nor was he able to bear hardships; 
so he developed studious habits that were not 
considered good for him. By the.advice of this 
dear old doctor he was sent-to his uncle’s farm 
with instructions that he must be kept in the 
open air as much as possible and on the newly 
plowed ground. All this was very trying to
-P-A-G-E-21
20 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
the spirits of the home-loving boy who wanted 
only a book and time to read it. 
He remained on the farm much of the time 
until he was sixteen years old, working during 
the summer and attending the winter schools 
during three or four months of each year. 
It was during this time that he was converted 
and joined the Baptist church in North Spring- 
field. His insatiable thirst for knowledge led 
him to return home that he might enter Chester 
Academy. He gave special attention to his 
classical and mathematical studies for three or 
four terms. Following this he went to the Bap- 
tist High School at Ludlow, where he pursued 
his studies till he was twenty-one years old, 
supporting himself all the while by teaching 
district schools in the mountains. It was an 
interesting story to hear him tell of his ex- 
periences as a teacher “boarding around with 
the scholars,” and trudging through the deep 
snow, sometimes long distances, to build the 
fires and get the school house comfortable for 
the pupils when they should arrive. He attrib- 
uted his iron constitution and his unusual 
powers in the school room to these experiences
-P-A-G-E-22
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 21 
and his life on the farm during the early years. 
He has been heard to say that during forty 
years he had not lost as much as forty days 
from the school room on account of sickness. 
The wonderful success of the winter schools 
which he taught during these training years, the 
great interest taken in their studies by his pu- 
pils, and his proficiency, marked him out as 
a coming great teacher before he had finished 
his education. 
It was during these school years that he was 
licensed to preach and he was supply pastor for 
the Baptist church at Chester, Vermont, for 
three years, although he was never ordained. 
He explained this by saying, “The voice im- 
perative seemed to whisper ‘go teach’ instead 
of ‘go preach.’” So he obeyed the voice and 
gave his life to teaching. When he was twenty- 
one years old he went West and opened an 
academy at Ashtabula, Ohio, where he was 
soon recognized as a wonderfully successful 
teacher. Upon the resignation of his brother, 
Dr. J. R. Graves, he was elected. principal of 
the Kingsville Academy, situated in a neat
-P-A-G-E-23
22 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
little village on the shores of Lake Erie, and 
moved there in 1837. 
In the sketch of Dr. Z. C. Graves in “Promi- 
nent Tennesseans,” written by Honorable Wil- 
liam J. Speers in 1888, he says of this American 
educator: ‘The success of the young educator, 
only twenty-one years of age when beginning 
his work in Ohio, was brilliant. His pupils 
came from many states.” . 
Dr. Graves is said to have introduced the 
first blackboard ever used in the Western Re- 
serve. He also introduced the Object Lesson 
teaching in that section. He insisted that teach- 
ers, like poets, are born and not made; that 
mechanical teachers are not successes. His 
theory was that “students could like and assimi- 
late their mental food if it was cooked right.” 
Mr. Speers also states that “many of his stu- 
dents became distinguished in after life, among 
whom were Professor Lucien Osborn, who for 
forty years was professor in Madison Univer- 
sity; Professor J. W. Fowler, president of 
Michigan University; Rev. J. W. Knopp, and 
Rev. William Ward, missionaries to Burma; 
and Rev. Daniel Bliss, missionary to Syria,
-P-A-G-E-24
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 23 
founder of the Syrian Protestant College at 
Beirut, and its honored president for thirty- 
six years.” / 
In the “Reminiscences of Daniel Bliss,” Dr. 
Bliss says, “In the early autumn of 1846, I 
entered Kingsville Academy and commenced 
the study of Algebra, Greek, and Latin. On 
my applying for entrance, Dr. Graves, the prin- 
cipal, asked my age, attainments and purpose. 
“Being told I was twenty-three, he replied: ‘A 
man who intends to go through college should 
commence Greek and Latin at a much earlier 
age.’ I said to myself with far more confidence 
than judgment, ‘I will teach him Greek and 
Latin before I die.’” 
He again says, on page fifty-one: “Soon af- 
ter my return to the academy, Dr. Graves asked 
me to become pupil-teacher while continuing 
Latin and Greek. I used to teach in the mathe- 
matical department and to receive my full 
board and tuition in the families of the princi- 
pal and vice-principal. Dr. Fowler, my teacher 
in Greek, was an accomplished scholar and took 
much interest in my work. Mrs. Graves, the 
wife of the principal, was a fine Latin scholar
-P-A-G-E-25
24 DR. Z. C. GRAVES. 
and assisted me much: in Virgil while for six 
months I was a member of her family.” 
Daniel Bliss read the valedictory for his 
class and became “a candidate for college.” 
He went to Amherst College and if you should 
read the description. of the curriculum of 
studies at Amherst, on page fifty-seven of his 
“Reminiscences,” you could be sure that Mary 
Sharp’s curriculum was patterned after it in 
every particular. Dr. Bliss lived to be ninety-_ 
three years old and died July 27, 1916. 
Professor Graves married in Kingsville, 
Ohio, July 3, 1841. He married Adelia C. 
Spencer, a daughter of Dr. Daniel Spencer and 
a sister of Platt Spencer, the author of the 
Spencerian system of penmanship. She was 
a woman of rare culture and was indeed a help- 
meet and an inspiration to him in his life work, . 
for she was not only a teacher, but a poetess 
and authoress of no mean ability. Four chil- 
dren were born to them, three sons and one 
daughter, all of whom he survived. The only 
grandchild still lives, Anna, now Mrs. D. W. 
Harris, of Tullahoma, Tennessee.
-P-A-G-E-26
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 25 
COMING TO WINCHESTER 
After teaching in Kingsville twelve years, 
Dr. Graves began his work at Mary Sharp Col- 
lege. The school was organized in 1850 and - 
when ready to open as a college for women, the 
name of Z. C. Graves was placed before the 
trustees by his brother, J. R. Graves, through 
whose influence and labors the school had 
largely been organized. 
A correspondence was opened by Colonel A. 
S. Colyar, which resulted in Dr. Graves’ elec- 
tion to the presidency of the institution. He 
and his family arrived in Winchester, Ten- 
nessee, on Christmas Eve, 1850; and on New 
Year’s morning, 1851, he began organizing his 
classes. 
He began as a pioneer with a well-defined 
purpose to establish a college for the higher 
education of women and to “demonstrate the 
fact that woman’s mind generally is sus- 
ceptible of the same degree of development. 
as the masculine mind in the abstract sciences, 
mathematics, metaphysics, and ethics.” With 
the conviction that woman has as much to live 
for, as much to accomplish, as a man; as much
-P-A-G-E-27
26 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
at stake as he, as much to crave as he; that her 
life is as real and earnest, her conflicts as sharp 
and trying, her desires as strong, her hopes as 
high; her position as responsible, her interests 
in the past and future as great as a man’s; hence 
he devoted his life to this higher ideal of edu- 
cation for women. And with what wonderful 
success in the face of strong prejudices and 
opposition the women of the Southland who 
came under his influence in the school room give 
unmistakable proof. 
THE NAME OF THE COLLEGE 
The college was named after Mrs. Mary 
Sharp, of Franklin County, Tennessee, accord- 
ing to a promise made to her as the largest donor 
to its financial support. Its curriculum was 
patterned after that of Brown University and 
Amherst College. And the Seniors of Mary 
Sharp passed creditable examinations with the 
Seniors of men’s colleges. In 1861, only ten 
years after this fortuitous beginning, there were 
between three hundred and five hundred girls 
attending Mary: Sharp College from twelve 
different states. This can be largely accounted
-P-A-G-E-28
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 27 
for when we realize that his honored brother, 
Dr. J. R. Graves, then editor of The Tennessee 
Baptist in Nashville, Tennessee, as he traveled 
over the Southern states, went everywhere 
pleading for the higher education of women 
and gathering up the daughters for Mary 
Sharp College. 
During the Civil War, after the fall of Fort 
Donelson, the Federal troops on their way 
toward Chattanooga stopped in Winchester. 
They used the college building as a hospital and 
either destroyed or marred about all that had 
cost those years of labor and heartaches to build 
up. 
After about two years of suspension, Dr. 
Graves with heroic faith and strength and cour- 
age, opened the doors of the school again, and 
taught for several years without a salary that 
he might teach the Southern girls, along with 
their books, the art of meeting the changed con- 
ditions, known as the Reconstruction Period. 
He lived to see the fruit of his labors, for he 
lived to see his beloved college building once 
more filled with hundreds of girls from every 
state of the South, earnestly, eagerly prepar-
-P-A-G-E-29
28 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
ing themselves for real work in the arena of 
life. 
By the urgent solicitation of the trustees of 
Soule College, of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, Dr. 
Graves was induced, in 1891, to resign the 
presidency of Mary Sharp College and accept 
that of theirs. In September, 1893, after two 
years there, he was urged to accept a professor- 
ship in the new Baptist college for women at 
Nashville, Tennesse, called “Boscobel.” It so 
appealed to him that he accepted it. Plans were 
perfected in 1893 to reconstruct the old Mary 
Sharp College. The building was thoroughly 
renovated. A strong faculty was secured, with 
Dr. Graves again as president: A new hotel 
just across the way was bought for a college 
home for the girls; and prospects for a good 
opening in September seemed sure. But that 
long-to-be remembered financial crisis of Sep- 
tember, 1893, swept over the country, when 
banks closed daily and you could not even with- 
draw what money you had in the banks except 
in small per cent. This, of course, cut down 
the attendance and made it impossible to run 
the college more than three years.
-P-A-G-E-30
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 29 
The Senior class of Boscobel College fol- 
lowed Dr. Graves there that they might gradu- 
ate under him and from Mary Sharp College, 
the Alma Mater of the mothers of most, if not 
all of the class. So in June, 1896, the old Mary 
Sharp College, so dear to the hearts of the old 
president and thousands of women over the 
Southland, ceased its activities and closed its 
doors for all time.. What a death blow it must 
have been to the soul of such a man. But he had 
become so deaf he knew that his teaching days 
were over. His beloved wife, the true helpmeet 
of his youth, had died in 1894. So he retired 
to his library and buried himself in his be- 
loved books, varied only by the joy of teaching 
his two little granddaughters who lived in the 
home. But the time came when he could not 
even hear their little voices, and his books be- 
came his only companionship and only solace. 
In his old home in Winchester, Tennessee, un- 
der the tender care of his daughter-in-law, Mrs. 
Hubert Graves, he passed quietly and peace- 
fully his remaining years, taking a daily walk 
to town to get the mail and see his friends along
-P-A-G-E-31

the way who did so much to cheer and comfort 
him during these waiting years. 
One bright day in June, 1902, he calmly and 
peacefully slipped away from his tired and 
worn-out body into the beyond to receive his 
reward for a long life of service to mankind 
and to the world in his generation. 
“The great men pass. We stand appalled and say, 
‘How shall we live, when these have left our day? 
How shall we fight when splendid leaders fall? 
How work, when silent is their bugle call? 
“The great men pass, but pass unto the light, 
Their brave feet climbing up some heavenly height; 
We need, not fear, or great, or small, if we 
Are workers for the vast eternity.”

DR. GRAVES—-THE TEACHER 
Since it is a difficult thing to separate a man 
from his environment a brief description of the 
buildings which comprised the Mary Sharp 
College of our day seems a fitting way to begin 
this study of the president, Dr. Graves. The 
main building consisted of three stories, flanked 
on either side by two-story wings. The chapel 
occupied the entire first floor of the central por- 
tion, and had elevated seats and the rostrum 
across the eastern end. ‘Directly above the 
chapel, and of the same dimensions, was the 
study-hall. Windows in the north and south 
walls gave perfect light and ventilation. The 
desks were comfortable, with ample writing 
space on top and a deep receptacle underneath 
for all books. 
Dr. Graves taught his classes in the south- 
eastern corner of this hall. How could the other 
pupils study with recitations going on all the 
[811
-P-A-G-E-33
32 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
time? The secret lies in the marvelous atmos- 
phere which he created in that room. One soon 
learned to concentrate on the lesson in hand. 
My desk was only two rows from his class seats, 
yet I could, and did, commit to memory any 
assigned task. I also solved mathematical prob- 
lems without being conscious of what was trans- 
piring in his class. This held true for all the 
others in that immense room. At the beginning 
of each term he always said: “Young ladies, if 
you have to speak to your neighbor or anyone 
across the hall I know you will do so without 
disturbing me or the class.” No girl was ever 
so thoughtless or rude as to do so. 
He classified all new students, and it usually 
took him three days to complete this work of 
assigning them to the proper classes. He inter- 
viewed them in a body, walking up and down 
in front of the girls, and glancing quickly from 
one face to the other without saying a word for 
some time. Then he began by examining for 
the classes in English first. This he did by 
writing a word on the blackboard and asking 
its meaning as it stood alone. The correct an- 
swer given, he would add other words to make
-P-A-G-E-34
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 33 
a phrase, clause or sentence. The group under 
fire was further tested by all grammatical and 
rhetorical rules. He would then come back to 
the others with a simple illustration or story, 
and those who could grasp his meaning quickly 
were tested as far as they could go, and so on 
to the most stupid girl, without embarrassment 
toanyone. This method he used also for Latin, 
Greek, mathematics and the sciences. 
He never failed to find out exactly where a 
girl belonged. While there were no irregular 
courses he never kept a girl back if she was 
prepared to take some studies in more advanced 
classes. So it happened that many had fresh- 
man, sophomore, and junior studies all in the 
same year. During these three days of test- 
ing for class standing he also gauged the dis- 
positions of the girls as well. 
He quickly detected whether or not they were 
teachable. If any were not in an attitude of 
mind to be taught he knew just how to win 
their confidence and to reveal their deficiencies 
to them. He understood human nature and the 
method of approach to all. The girls were al- 
lowed to relax going to and from classes. They
-P-A-G-E-35
34 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
talked and laughed, and walked rapidly .or 
slowly as they chose. There was no marching 
or enforced silence at this time as if they were 
under military discipline. 
From early childhood he wanted to know the 
whys and wherefores of things, and this de- 
sire naturally led him to ask questions and to 
observe. His investigative turn of mind soon 
fixed his habit of study. Through the years, 
by systematic hard work, reading, meditation, 
and close observation he literally heaped up 
knowledge. He drew from every source where 
there was a grain of truth. He never made a 
superficial study of any subject, but mastered 
it by critical analysis and profound thought. 
His source of supply was all nature, the best 
books, and “The Book of all Books.” By mid- 
dle life he had not only accumulated knowledge 
but had classified it so it was his to handle and 
to use. 
Someone has said: “To teach a small thing 
well we must be large ourselves.” He certainly 
verified this statement. He was equally fa- 
miliar with every subject taught in the school. 
Not only did he have a wealth of information
-P-A-G-E-36
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 35 
but he had the rare faculty to impart it to 
others. No one understood better than he that 
facts and principles are tedious and tasteless, 
and often incomprehensible unless unfolded in 
such a way as to give a gleam of light and to 
awaken a desire to know more on the part of 
young students. The motto of the college was 
“Learn to think.” He spared no effort to 
develop this trait in every student. Personal 
investigation and originality was what he 
sought to stimulate in all, and he did everything 
to encourage individual endeavor. He did not 
care how slow and stumbling the effort was to 
form one’s own opinion or conclusion after 
hearing all discussions, if only the effort were 
made to do so. He did not enjoy a slavish at- 
titude of mind in anyone. 
Dr. Graves possessed the passion and the art 
of a great teacher to live and work for others. 
I do not believe that financial compensation was 
ever in his thoughts. Incessant labor had been 
his, firstly, to acquire knowledge for his own 
satisfaction, and secondly, to lead the ignorant, 
idle, dull, and indifferent, restless, bouyant and 
normal young minds a little beyond their own
-P-A-G-E-37
36 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
constricted, uninstructed world. Even the new- 
est pupils soon sensed his intellectual power and 
wealth, and they followed his teachings eagerly, 
thrilled to know something of these hidden se- 
crets of which they had never heard. The fol- 
lowing extracts from some old Mary Sharp 
catalogues will give an insight into Dr. Graves’ 
conception of a true teacher and his methods: 
“What many call education is simply instruc- 
tion. A child is the germ of a man or woman. 
If left to itself it will evolve into manhood or 
womanhood by its own spontaneous vitality. 
But without culture the mind becomes rather 
an impenetrable jungle than a field of waving 
grain.” 
“The possibilities of life slumber in the un- 
expanded bud, physical power exists in the slen- 
der muscle of the child, mental power dwells 
in the untrained mind, and so surely as the 
beauty and perfection of the flower and fruit 
depend upon warmth, light and moisture, and 
physical strength is related to food and exer- 
cise, just so truly does mental vigor depend 
upon those influences which reach and stir to 
activity the vital forces.”
-P-A-G-E-38
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 37 
“The true teacher does not chisel cold marble ~ 
into a pulseless Apollo, but cultivates the tender 
plant into a sturdy, vigorous growth that not 
only shall stand the sweeping tempest, but will 
bear a bounteous harvest. His aim is not only 
to impart knowledge, but to direct for a time 
the powers of mind which this knowledge has. 
nourished and stimulated. He marshals these 
powers, not for a single field but for life’s cam- 
paign. Pupils should be taught how to study, 
and that it is not the number of hours spent 
with books in hand, but close thinking that 
secures thorough discipline, good lessons, and 
sound learning. The wise teacher instructs his 
pupils to study thoughts and subjects instead 
of words and books. Both the teacher and pupil 
must work. Indolence in him begets idleness 
and recklessness in the student. The results 
of an education are not illustrated by the 
golden cup filled to the brim, but by the swell- 
ing bud, which developed into growth, will, 
through the drifting years of life continue to 
bloom and bear fruit.” 
No words of mine can give you any concep- 
tion of this most unusual teacher, Dr. Graves,
-P-A-G-E-39
38 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
of his mental and moral powers, so I again give 
you his synopsis of the School of Philosophy : 
“Mental and moral sciences aim to give cor- 
rect ideas of the mental operations, their 
nature and relation to each other, and also the 
importance of clearly understanding and faith- 
fully discharging our moral obligations. The 
principles of which they treat form the founda- 
tion of character, regulate and determine the 
sphere of usefulness, and become the source of 
happiness, and while they teach the nature of 
man, they unfold and impress those great and 
sublime truths which come from heaven, and 
which are inseparably connected with our tem- 
poral and eternal destinies. 
“The method of instruction is given in the 
text-books, but a wide margin is filled in by 
lectures, oral comments, explanations and 
illustrations. Questions are asked and discus- 
sions encouraged. to bring out the students’ 
powers of investigation and to awaken individ- 
ual thought and to elicit independent reflection. 
Other authors are referred to, different views 
noticed and examined, and the whole ground of 
investigation of the topic under discussion is
-P-A-G-E-40
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 39 
laid before the class. Students are made to feel 
that, as an element of thought, or inspiration of 
life, one intelligent conviction really their own, 
gained by honest reflection, and sustained with 
earnest candor, is worth a myriad of borrowed 
opinions, no matter how profound.” 
“Yet with all this freedom of discussion and 
examination, a prudent conservation and re- 
spect for authority is preserved, and it is sought 
by every legitimate influence of explanation and 
reasoning to establish intelligent convictions of 
man’s spiritual existence, of the certainty of 
knowledge within definite limits, and of respon- 
sibility to law in all its departments, natural, 
civil, and moral.” 
“Students are taught to see in nature the 
revelation of the great architect, and upon every 
hand to recognize, written in unmistakable 
language, the great argument of design. No 
system of education can be complete which dis- 
regards the laws and forces of nature.” 
I quote his own words: “Education is soul 
growth. It is a force which acts from within 
outward. That system of education which deals 
only with the intellect is morally absurd, since
-P-A-G-E-41
40 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
a man is what his heart is. His faith, and 
hopes, and purposes are the foundation and 
superstructure of his entire personality, Edu- 
cation must begin and end with the heart. Neg- 
lect this person in the trinity of man’s nature 
and the other powers will lash, torment, and 
destroy each other in endless contradictions.” 
In reading the catalogue of 1885 I realize 
how much kinder and fairer it would be to the 
public for me to quote what he said regarding 
the teachings of the college in the development 
of the mind, heart, and character of the young 
than for me to attempt to explain his ideas on 
these subjects in words of my own. Not only 
did he influence and stimulate the students 
toward putting forth their best efforts in the 
pursuit of literary lore, but in his interpreta- 
tion of God’s word he showed himself the 
matchless teacher. All-the fundamentals that 
one needs to know for a life time were taught 
directly from the Bible in the morning devo- 
tional exercises. The students usually quoted 
yerses of scripture and Dr. Graves commented 
on them. Line upon line, and precept upon 
precept how to value good health were given.
-P-A-G-E-42
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 41 
Instruction in this important subject was never 
overlooked, and I believe these illuminating 
lessons found lodgment in the minds of most 
of the girls. 
We were also taught how to laugh: “For as 
the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the 
laughter of fools.” (Eccles. 7: 6.) His word 
picture of a coarse, vulgar, ignorant girl laugh- 
ing loudly and boisterously in a public place 
never. failed to impress even the most inatten- 
* tive student. 
He also gave as faithful a word picture of 
the righteous man: “He will fill thy mouth 
with laughter and thy lips with shouting.” 
His advice about visiting was minute and bene- 
ficial, typified in the verse: “Withdraw thy foot 
from thy neighbor’s house, lest he become weary 
of thee and so hate thee.” True friendship he 
found exemplified in David and Jonathan. He 
also taught that “a good name is rather to be 
desired than great riches, and loving favor 
rather than silver and gold”; since he believed 
and tried to convince others that a name above 
reproach and the love and esteem of all in a 
community were of far more worth than all
-P-A-G-E-43
42 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
the material wealth one could possess. “Every 
wise woman buildeth her house, but the fool- 
ish plucketh it down with her own hands.” He 
said this verse meant the building of one’s own 
character, or the destroying of it, accepting 
God’s commands and promises, or rejecting 
them. Warning against idleness he quoted: 
“Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her 
ways and be wise; which having no overseer, or 
ruler, provideth her bread in the summer, and 
gathereth her food in the harvest.” ‘‘Wealth 
got by vanity shall be diminished, but he that 
gathereth by labor shall have increase.”. Hon- 
est, persistent effort will win a competency and 
contentment and peace of mind. He taught 
that: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning 
of wisdom”; also, “Fear God and keep his 
commandments, for this is the whole duty of 
man.” 
The one consuming passion of Dr. Graves’ 
life was to develop the girls who came under 
his influence into the highest and noblest char- 
acters of which they were capable. The flatter- 
ing offers in other lines of endeavor, with large 
money compensation, never swerved him from
-P-A-G-E-44
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 43 
this one purpose. I believe that his choosing 
the higher education of women for his life 
work was God-directed. His love, devotion, 
and determination for the same proved that his 
choice was from a higher power than his own. 
His whole being was saturated with the thought 
that girls must be fitted for life’s responsibili- 
ties by education, culture, and spiritual de- 
velopment. He taught in the chapel devo- 
tionals, and also in his classes, that God is. 
supreme, therefore his creatures should seek to 
know and to obey his written conditions as ex- 
pounded in the Bible. He regarded the girls 
committed to his care and instruction a sacred 
trust, and to bring them to the highest and 
best was for them to know God. He did not 
fail to declare “the whole counsel of God” as 
it pertained to the physical, mental, and spirit- 
ual welfare of man. It was this one phase that 
made Dr. Graves the matchless teacher that he 
unquestionably was. That intangible some- 
thing we call atmosphere was brought about by 
the rare personality of the man, and he awak- 
ened in every girl a desire to be somebody 
worthwhile, and to do something worthwhile,
-P-A-G-E-45
44 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
and that worthwhile something was to do what- 
soever “thy hand findeth to do.” Only those 
who studied under his guiding hand, and those 
associated with him on the teaching staff, will 
ever understand his wonderfully consecrated 
personality. The originality of his thoughts 
were like fresh revelations. One could read 
the text-books but not such thoughts or explana- 
tions as he gave. For example, in the study of 
Botany he taught not only that a leaf or a blade 
of grass had a certain formation, but that back 
of all plant life was the all-wise creator. No 
student ever left Mary Sharp College with her 
faith in the Bible tottering or destroyed, or her 
mind filled with doubts and questionings con- 
cerning the Deity of Jesus Christ. 
Dr. Graves ever sought to have Mary Sharp 
College stand upon its merits of “thorough 
scholarship, good manners and pure morals,” 
and he kept it up to this standard. He scorned 
the thought of having an agent to solicit pupils 
for his school. Our dear old president lived 
and died without ever realizing that his brother, 
Dr. J. R. Graves, who really conceived the idea 
of establishing the school for the higher educa-
-P-A-G-E-46
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 45 
tion of women, was always the interested, but 
unofficial and unheralded, field secretary for 
Mary Sharp College.

DR. Z. C. GRAVES—A CITIZEN 
What is a citizen? What constitutes good 
citizenship? I am moved to ask these ques- 
tions before entering on the discussion of Dr. 
Graves asa Citizen. According to the ordinary 
conception of good citizenship, perhaps our 
great teacher might not measure up in the minds 
of some. Doubtless, if some of the older people 
of Winchester were asked what kind of a citi- 
zen Dr. Graves was, they without thinking 
probably would reply, “Oh, he’s a school teach- 
er, he takes no interest in civic affairs nor any- 
thing outside the school.” True, he was a 
busy man. His time, thought and prayers were 
given absolutely to his beloved work and he 
had little time left for active effort in civic 
affairs. But of one thing you could be sure, 
his influence was always on the side of right and 
righteousness. What a wonderful thing it is 
that God has made men whose “lives are so 
[46]
-P-A-G-E-48
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 47 
hid with Christ in God” that they emanate such 
an influence that no one doubts that they are 
on the side of everything good. It is the glow- 
ing spirit of the man, the God-like-ness that is 
the silent, yet potent influence that is felt. 
Dr. Graves had a habit of talking with the 
young men about town, particularly ministers 
and lawyers. When school was over in the 
afternoon he would walk leisurely down town 
for his mail and there about the post office he 
would frequently meet some young minister of 
the town and purposely engage him in conversa- 
tion. It would usually take a metaphysical 
turn, and as some one has said, “During the 
Golden Age of Mary Sharp College, the atmos- 
‘phere of the town was charged with metaphy- 
sics, and the subjects discussed on the streets 
and in the market places, reminded one of a 
Scotch village.” In these conversations he 
would draw the young man out and encourage 
him to express his own ideas and in return Dr. 
Graves would give him new and advanced 
thoughts. He was a man many years ahead of 
his times and his original ideas no doubt were 
an inspiration to many.
-P-A-G-E-49
48 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
Perhaps by indirection, by proxy, if you 
please, he may have wielded a far greater in- 
fluence in civic and religious affairs than by 
personally taking an active part in these mat- 
ters. 
Through the long years in the school room— 
about a half a century—who could dare estimate 
the influences for good citizenship put in motion 
by him through the thousands of girls who be- 
came the mothers of our Southland? Who can 
tell how great a part he had, though a New 
Englander by birth, in the reconstruction and 
rehabilitation of the South! In the halls of Con- 
gress and in the great pulpits of the land doubt- 
less, he still speaks through the teaching of high 
principles and holy living to the mothers of the 
South, that were passed on to their sons and 
their sons’ sons. As a pebble cast into the ocean 
sets in motion physical forces that are unend- 
ing, so, in a far greater sense, a true man sets 
moral forces in action, the returns of which 
are infinite, eternal. It is staggering to con- 
template. Sarah K. Bolton so beautifully says 
of influence:
-P-A-G-E-50
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 49 
“The smallest bark on life’s tumultuous ocean 
Will leave a track behind forever more; 
The lightest wave of influence, once in motion, 
Extends and widens to the eternal shore. 
We should be wary, then, who go before 
A myriad yet to be, and we should take 
Our bearings carefully where breakers roar 
And fearful tempests gather; one mistake 
May wreck unnumbered barks that follow in our 
wake.” 
Although Dr. Graves was born in Vermont 
and came South in the late forties, yet he be- 
came so identified with the South and the 
Southern people that no one ever thought of 
him as a Northern man. Then, when the war 
between the states came he gave his son to the 
Southern army and that boy never returned. 
He proved himself a true citizen of this South- 
land in this great sacrificial act. An old lady 
in Winchester told me that when sad news came 
to the homes of the Winchester people during 
the war—and it came often—Dr. Graves was 
always there with an encouraging and comfort- 
ing thought for the bereaved. A good citizen 
indeed!
-P-A-G-E-51
50 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
Recently I was in Winchester and visited the 
grave of our revered teacher. It chanced to be 
on April 15, 1924, the one hundred and eighth 
anniversary of his birth. As I stood. with, rev- 
erent spirit by his grave I thought, after the 
lapse of all these years, it is no wonder that so 
many daughters ‘“‘rise up to call him blessed.” 
It seems that some men are so great, their lives 
loom so large, that they must be seen in far per- 
spective to get the full meaning and really see 
the greatness of their lives. So often a great 
man is not fully appreciated in his own genera- 
tion. Ina measure this was true of Dr. Graves. 
Personally, as a young girl, I feel that I could 
not appreciate him fully. But after long years, 
and by contrast with other smaller men of the 
same profession, we come to realize his true 
worth and that he was indeed and in truth a 
great and good citizen. 
“So, when a great man dies, for years beyond our ken 
The light he leaves behind him lies upon the paths of 
men.”

A COINCIDENCE 
In the spring of 1920 we received a letter 
from a dear lady of Manchester, Tennessee, 
who had seen a notice of a meeting of our Mary 
Sharp College Club, of which Mrs. Nora 
Graves Hailey was President. This reminded 
her that she had had an old gentleman neigh- 
bor when she lived in Ososi, California, who 
had a blank book containing Dr. Z. C. Graves’ 
address before his first graduating class and 
other writings. He was very anxious to get it 
into the hands of some member of his family. 
So, if we wanted it she could send us his ad- 
dress. We wanted it, and she sent the address 
to our President. She wrote him and he sent 
it to her as you see from the following letter: 
1511
-P-A-G-E-53
52 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
“Ososi, California, June 29, 1920. 
Mrs. Nora Graves HalLey, 
Nashville, Tenn. 
Dear Mapam: Your letter of June 19, 1920, came 
to hand in due time, also one from the lady who was 
in time past a neighbor of ours and whom I very much 
respected, and it all brought back those days of long 
ago and for a few days, at times, I have hardly been at 
home for my mind and thoughts go back to the days of 
60 to ’65. It was in July, 1863, that our men encamped 
in Winchester, Tennessee, near Cowan Station. I was 
keeping a diary of my soldier life and one of my needs 
was blank books. So one day I was in the Mary Sharp 
College and found a blank book nearly blank. It had 
an address from Z. C. Graves to the graduating class 
of ladies and others, no doubt written by him. I took 
it for my need but I did not use it for my diary but as 
a scrap book and in lonesome moments wrote whatever 
came to mind. 
I shall send you the book just as it remains to-day. 
Why I have kept it I cannot explain. I have often tried 
in the past to get it back to the Graves family. Rev. 
J. D. Black, a Presbyterian minister, who was the pastor 
of our church in Ososi, called at our home quite often 
and one day we were talking of the early life and, if 
I remember correctly, he said he attended school in Win- 
chester, Tennessee. It brought to mind my being there 
during those days of yore. I thought of this book and
-P-A-G-E-54
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 53 
got it and showed it to him. He looked it over and said 
he was well acquainted with Dr. Graves. 
I then told him I would be pleased to return it to 
him or any member of his family but never Heard any- 
thing from it. , 
And now it is a pleasure to me to send it to you. I 
would dearly love to talk to you. It would be so much 
better than to try to write and I want to say, should 
you ever come this way, my latch string hangs outside 
clear to the highway and just the same to any of your 
club or friends who may come this way. Please extend 
this invitation to them. I am in my eightieth year and 
in fairly good health. 
I do not write as plainly as I did once but hope you 
can read it. We have quite a number of people here 
from Tennessee; a neighbor across the street is from that 
state. So to-day I will mail you the book which you will 
no doubt find genuine. Shall be pleased to hear if you 
receive it. Very respectfully, 
J. R. Reep.” 
The book was duly received and promptly 
acknowledged. A member of the club told us 
she had a copy of Dr. Graves’ address to his 
last graduating class, of which she was a mem- 
ber. Strangely it happened they were both re- 
ceived and read at the same club meeting, and 
are both given here, with some remarks of Dr. 
Graves on education found in this book.

VI : 
DR. GRAVES’ FIRST TALK AT THE OPENING 
OF THE COLLEGE 
We have assembled this evening for the first 
time in the relation which we sustain to each 
other. This is not a place that any of you may 
recognize as your “Alma Mater.” No past 
events are associated with this place. All is 
new and in its embryo. We have assembled 
ourselves to witness the first pulsations of life 
of the institution that has but just been ushered 
into existence. 
All that has yet been accomplished, has been 
done at great sacrifice on the part of both the 
officers and teachers. The pupils have out- 
numbered the expectations of the warmest 
friends of this enterprise. Many have been our 
anxieties, fears, and struggles. To-night we 
say to our patrons and friends, we have done 
what we could, we bid you welcome to the scene 
of our labors. We ask you patiently to examine 
(54)
-P-A-G-E-56
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 55 
our work, to listen to our first performances in 
public as a school and learn our plans, designs, 
and expectations as we shall continue to labor 
to found here a great and permanent institu- 
tion for the education of our ‘daughters. 
We are not unlike the first pioneers of this 
place. If you had visited them they would have 
warmly and cordially welcomed you to their 
hospitality, recounted to you their trials and 
struggles, asked you to consider what they had 
already accomplished although it might not 
have been more than the erecting of a rude 
cabin by the boiling spring and the breaking 
for the first time of a few acres of ground; 
watched suspiciously by the red hunters and 
surrounded by prowling beasts of prey. They 
then would have pointed out to you the 
fertility of the soil, the salubriousness of the cli- 
mate and predicted upon these their future ex- 
pectations of all that was then, to them desir- 
able; extensive and productive plantations; 
freedom from enemies, facilities for market. 
Academies and colleges must be -built for the 
education of their children; realizing at the 
same time, that their strength must be greatly
-P-A-G-E-57
56 DR. Z, C. GRAVES 
increased by constant additions to their num- 
bers. Roads must be constructed, the moun- 
tain barriers must be broken down. We hope 
that thirty years hence whoever shall assemble 
upon this spot to attend the anniversary exer- 
cises of this institution, among that number 
may be found many who will say, “This was 
my cherishing mother. Ten thousand are the 
interesting and pleasing recollections connected 
with this spot, and dear to me is this place of 
my mental discipline although many were my 
struggles, anxieties and self denials,.when a 
student.” 
And as the inhabitants of this place now 
receive you as guests, welcoming you to well 
furnished dwellings, the abodes of peace, com- 
fort, and plenty, and lead you when refreshed to 
see a flourishing village with its temple of 
justice and its stores filled with heavy stacks of 
merchandise and with its skillful and indus- 
trous mechanics. And then take you to see that 
the mountain obstacles have been overcome, that 
they are almost in connection with the Atlantic 
coast on the East and the Father of Waters on 
the West. So may the officers of this institution
-P-A-G-E-58
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 57 
show to their visitors a great and a glorious 
college with its own buildings, library and 
apparatus, rendered permanent by its endowment 
fund.

EXTRACTS FROM THE “BLANK BOOK” ON 
EDUCATION 
CULTIVATION OF THE MIND 
OxjEcTs TO BE ATTAINED 
The objects to be attained by cultivating are: 
1. The power of fixing the mind on any 
subject you wish and holding the attention upon 
it as long as you please. 
2. To fix in the mind the elementary 
principles of all that remains of life: such as 
the principles of science, of government, and 
laws and religion. 
3. To give the mind precision of thought. 
4. To give you the power of using language 
and defining what you mean by such terms as 
are appropriate and expressive of just your 
meaning. 
5. To fill the mind with the materials of 
thought, such as facts, which we read, observe 
and hear. 
[68]
-P-A-G-E-60
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 59 
6. To teach the mind where to-go for infor- 
mation—that is, from what sources it may 
draw. , 
7. To teach the mind how .to take up a 
subject, investigate it, and draw conclusions on 
which you may rely. 
8. To cultivate the judgment as to what facts 
are worth preserving, and what are applicable 
in proving or illustrating a particular point. 
9. To cultivate the memory so that the 
materials which you gather may not be dissi- 
pated and lost as fast as gathered. 
Education gives the power to take your mind 
and make it the instrument of conveying 
knowledge and good impressions upon minds as 
well as itself made happy. 
An educated mind has so many resources 
within itself, it has not to depend on outward 
circumstances for happiness.

It procures for us the pleasure of many

It increases our respectability. 
It increases our power of doing good. 
Education renders the mind calm, thought- 
ful, discriminating, prompt, energetic. 
It helps us to see and weigh the absolute and 
relative importance of every subject within our 
scope. 
It puts a man in possession of himself; it 
gives him victory over his spirit. 
It prevents indolence, vanity, presumption, 
folly, and selfishness. 
It promotes politeness, order, decency, rever-

THE OBLIGATIONS OF PARENTS TO GIVE 
THEIR DAUGHTERS A THOROUGH, SYS- 
TEMATIC, FINISHED EDUCATION 
WHENEVER IT IS WITHIN 
THEIR POWER 
Let us consider what will be their trials in 
life. 
In every station she can occupy is a woman 
exposed to trials and troubles and the more she
-P-A-G-E-62
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 61 
is bound to others the more is she exposed to 
sorrow in her own person. Permit me to read 
to you the opinion of the celebrated Dr. Greg- 
ory whose age, opportunities and wisdom ren- 
der him a witness whose testimony is most 
desirable and cannot be discredited : 
“Almost synonymous with suffering is the name of 
woman; for though the troubles that man and woman 
have to bear, may, if considered in the abstract, be much 
the same in amount, yet if reference be made to woman’s 
sensibility, whether of mind or body, the suffering must 
fall upon her much more than upon the man. She is 
so planned as not to be firm to withstand, or yet flexible 
enough to bend to the blast of affliction. Man has 
indeed vast trials and troubles, but then he has both a 
mind and a body constitutionally fitted to grapple with 
them whereas a woman has to bear the same amount of 
affliction with a temperament the very reverse.” 
Thus this witness deposeth : 
1. That woman has trials greater than man. 
2. She must suffer much more than man. 
3. She is constitutionally unfitted to grapple 
with them. 
What parent is so insensible to his daughter’s 
future happiness that he does not wish while 
she is with him, cherished by his love, to pro- 
vide for the trials and troubles before her?
-P-A-G-E-63
62 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
The question may be asked, “Will education 
do this?” I answer. It puts a person in pos- 
session of himself, it gives him victory over 
spirit. 
In proof of this proposition I refer. you to 
Lady Jane Grey. The fortitude with which 
she met her trials has rendered her name im- 
mortal. At the age of seventeen she was be- 
headed and she left behind her a career adorned 
with the brightest traces of fortitude, honor, 
and honesty and a character without a stain 
although upon her head had been placed the 
English crown. Was she educated? 
The celebrated Roger Ascham says that gain- 
ing admission to her apartment one day he 
“found her reading Plato in the original Greek, 
which she understood so perfectly as to excite 
in him extreme wonder. She possessed the 
power of speaking and writing in Greek and 
promised to address him a letter in that lan- 
guage although not yet seventeen. 
Again the temptations to which our daugh- 
ters are and ever will be exposed demand their 
education. :
-P-A-G-E-64
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 63 
The temptations to which woman is exposed 
are almost as numerous as their trials, especially 
during the season of youth, when the heart is 
most light and the cheek wears its fairest tint. 
From the homage which the world pays to 
beauty they are led to vanity and tempted to 
pursuits which procure them flattery and hom- 
age. Hence they are induced to enlist in the 
companionship of those who think pleasure 
the greatest good and I ask, is the devotee of 
pleasure happy? In the world our daughters 
will find that flattery takes the place of truth 
and in order to stand well with others and to 
have admirers around them they may soon 
exchange their love of truth for the sake of 
uttering things they do not feel—hollow flat- 
teries and empty praises. : 
The only safe barrier to the temptation above 
alluded to is a thorough intellectual and moral 
education. Education prevents indolence, van- 
ity, presumption, folly, and selfishness. It pro- 
motes politeness, order, decency, reverence, good 
will and, in short, whatever is lovely and of 
good report.
-P-A-G-E-65
64 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
Again I argue the obligation of parents to 
give their daughters systematic education from 
the fact that they will have one day resting 
upon them parental influence and responsi- 
bilities. 
The first impressions of the child, either of 
good or evil, are received under the parental 
roof. We can look back and see how our course 
has been shaped by it and how it has operated 
to place us in that very position where we stand 
to-day. Under the paternal roof the child re- 
ceives those lessons which will form in him the 
established principles of action for life—there 
his prevailing disposition is formed. The 
examples, the precepts, the principles, the doc- 
trines of his father and mother live with him— 
they take hold of his whole being, they fix his 
destiny—they lift him to honor or sink him 
to shame. 
But it is the mother’s influence chiefly—the 
combined weight and power of the lessons she 
has imparted, the precepts she has inculcated 
and the examples she has placed before the 
child that has fixed and determined his charac- 
ter, and made him a blessing or a curse to
-P-A-G-E-66
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 65 
society. The mother may mould the heart of 
her child as the potter would mould the clay. 
There is impressed all that is noble and ex- 
cellent as the signet impresses itself upon the 
yielding wax. 
By her neglect, her evil advice, her erroneous 
instruction, she may become instrumental in 
the disgrace and ruin of her child. It was re- 
marked of Washington that whatever of success 
or eminence he had attained—whatever of ex- 
cellency he possessed—he was indebted for it 
all under God to the watchfulness and care of 
his mother and to the attention she bestowed 
in the early cultivation of his mind and heart.

ADDRESS DELIVERED TO THE FIRST GRAD- 
UATING CLASS OF YOUNG LADIES OF 
THE MARY SHARP COLLEGE, 
JUNE 22, 1855 
Young Ladies: 
You have now attained the degree of 
Mistress of Arts and in accordance with a long 
established custom it devolves upon me to make 
some suggestions for your consideration accom- 
panied with advice to direct you in making 
higher attainments and for rightly discharging 
the responsible and momentous duties of life. 
The design of the course of study which you 
have in this institution completed, is, to give 
mental acumen and discipline to the student; to 
develop and strengthen those faculties which 
without study would long remain dormant; to 
engender in the mind habits of patient investi- 
gation by which truth is to be discovered and 
error in its infinite variety of disguises detected ; 
{663
-P-A-G-E-68
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 67 
to unlock and fling open to the student the 
libraries of the learned in which are deposited 
the accumulated wisdom of ages; to enable her 
to understand and be profited by the writings 
of the scholars of her own times and whenever 
she associates with them, to feel an affiliation 
which only the learned can feel for each other. 
Using a figure, I may say the object of this 
course of study is to convey the student to a 
country vast in extent, rich in inexhaustible 
treasure, laying open its precious mines, hav- 
ing put instruments in her hands with all 
needed ability to supply her wants and enrich 
herself. 
This course of study you have now completed. 
Having completed it—how different is: your 
situation holding that diploma, from that of 
the young man in the same condition? 
The schools of Law, Theology and Medicine 
open their doors to him, inviting his entrance. 
They offer to him a thousand inducements to 
use all his natural and acquired abilities in ap- 
propriating to him their garnered truths. This 
having been accomplished, society calls him to 
take a stand upon her contested fields and by
-P-A-G-E-69
68 DR. Z, C. GRAVES 
using the results of his intellectual labors to 
gain wealth for the gratification of his tastes 
in manhood and for the supplying of his wants 
‘in age, together with a name that shall be the 
honor of his descendants. 
But the doors of these schools are barred to 
your entrance. No public institution offers to 
you the means of ascending higher. Society 
has no inducements to offer in any of the 
jearned professions, if we except that of teach- 
ing. 
Is it asked what now remains for you to do? 
Permit me to suggest. I know that the public 
will say that you are educated, if you justly 
merit the diploma you possess. 
Let us inquire for a moment into the state 
or condition which is designated by the phrase, 
“She is educated.” I am afraid that it is not 
understood generally and I would not have 
you deceived by the popular use of the words, 
“educated and being educated,” as thousands 
are deceived. 
A deception that leads them to pursue such 
a course after they have received their degree 
in Arts as is destructive to their mental powers,
-P-A-G-E-70
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 69 
abridging their future usefulness and happi- 
ness. 
The word education is derived from “edu- 
cere” which means to draw forth, “to lead,” to 
train and exercise. Then in accordance with 
this primary meaning of the term we ought to 
understand that the powers or faculties of the 
students’ mind have been drawn out, trained 
and exercised. 
Education is, in the terse language of the 
distinguished educator, Page, “development.” 
‘It is not instruction merely—that is knowledge, 
it is the waking up of the mind; a growth of 
the mind; growth of the mind by a healthy 
assimilation of wholesome elements. It is an 
inspiring of the mind with a thirst for knowl- 
edge, growth, so far that it can go on to edu- 
cate itself, enlargement and then a disciplining 
of its powers, of its powers to observe, to res 
member, to reflect, and to combine. If to pos- 
sess facts merely is education, then is an ency- 
clopedia better educated than a man. 
The great popular mistake is to regard 
knowledge as education, or the great end of 
education all who have this erroneous opinion
-P-A-G-E-71
70 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
think that we affirm by the diploma which you 
have received that you have all the knowledge 
that is necessary for you to have. 
But we would correct this impression in. all 
minds, All that we do affirm by it is that by a 
prescribed course of study you have developed 
and disciplined the faculties and powers of 
your mind so that it can go on and educate it- 
self. By it we initiate you into the great school 
of self education in which none can ever grad- 
uate, for it is a school that has many degrees 
but no final ones. There are no bounds to your 
progress in all that is ennobling and dignifying 
tothe human mind. The creator of it has made 
it capable of infinite improvement, but not with- 
out untiring application. 
I would not wish to be understood to say that 
an individual can be educated without knowl- 
edge. Knowledge is the instrument used in 
educating minds, so that it is justly affirmed, 
that knowledge is not education, yet there can 
be no education without knowledge. 
Knowledge when subjected to critical analy- 
sis will be found to consist of facts and truths. 
We mean by facts all that the mind has
-P-A-G-E-72
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 71 
obtained by using the senses merely. The result 
. obtained by comparing these facts acquired by 
observation, experiment and experience, we 
denominate truth. Truths then are results ob- 
tained by comparing facts. They are influ- 
ences from facts. 
Then, young ladies, understanding what 
truth is and how it is obtained and seeing that 
God has made the mind for the apprehension 
of truth and set before it a world of glorious 
truths for it to apprehend, you see a great work 
distinctly. placed before you—an employment 
for a life time, a labor of the most dignifying 
kind which must afford the greatest delight to 
every well-educated mind. .To make yourself 
familiar with the discoveries of those who have 
preceded you, to gain an acquaintance with the 
history of individuals and nations that have 
passed from earth, as well asthose that are act- 
ing their parts upon the stage of life. The 
Bible is a record with which you cannot make 
yourselves too familiar, a history given by God 
himself, hence without error. It is an inex- 
haustible store-house of truths by the study of 
which with a right spirit all your wants will
-P-A-G-E-73
72 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
be supplied and you will become wise unto 
salvation. How justly it is named the “Book 
of Books!” This ought to hold the same place 
in your estimation in relation to other books, 
that the diamond does among the gems of earth, 
or the sun in the planetary system. If you have 
anything of wisdom you will read the scrip- 
tures daily. 
Besides this living fountain from which you 
can obtain that wisdom and knowledge which 
pertains both to the visible and invisible world 
these are the living powers of nature, the sub- 
lime disclosures of reason, the pleasures of 
taste, and the approved, brilliant creations of 
genius together with the transcendental attain- 
ments of philosophy, themes of undying interest 
placed before you demanding your attention 
and patient study. 
I should not discharge my duty to you while 
pointing out all these different fields of men- 
tal labor which ought to be assiduously culti- 
vated by you as educated women, if I did not 
warn you in relation to most of the works of 
fiction‘and “light literature,” as it is called, 
with which our country is flooded. A taste for
-P-A-G-E-74
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 73 
such reading is easily and quickly formed and 
when formed: a desire is eradicated from the 
mind for anything solid or beneficial. Nothing 
is more withering, ruinous and deadly than 
these productions. Their effect upon the mind 
is similar to that of spirituous liquors upon the 
physical system. The taste for novels is cul- 
tivated more readily of the two but it is no 
less pernicious or destructive. The habitual 
novel reader ought to be held in the same esti- 
mation as the habitual. drunkard. : The effect 
or ruin they produce is thus described by a 
truthful writer: “No habitual reader of 
novels,” says he, “can love the Bible or any 
book that demands serious attention or incul- 
cates the serious duties of life.” 
The readers of such dwell in a region of 
imagination where they are disgusted with the 
plainness and simplicity of truth; where they 
are dissatisfied with the sober realities of life 
and spurn everything that demands their at- 
tention as rational and mortal beings, and as 
accountable subjects of God’s government. Is 
not this a picture of mental ruin and destruc- 
tion?
-P-A-G-E-75
74 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
I might multiply authority to prove what I 
have said, young ladies. May you never know 
from your own individual experience that it 
is true. 
Avoid the reading of them as you would the 
taking of a slow and deadly poison in your 
food. 
I would not wish to leave the impression 
upon your minds that the great business of your 
lives should be only the improvement of your 
own minds and the furnishing of your selves 
with knowledge. One part of your great mis- 
sion into the world is to improve and benefit 
the world by your labors in it. The scholar 
has no more right to let his or her talent or 
ability lie dormant than the miser has to with- 
draw his gold from usefulness and horde it 
in his iron chest. We have been created social 
beings that we may bestow as well as receive 
benefits. 
A thorough education increases our power of 
doing good: 
1, By rendering the mind calm, thoughtful, 
discriminating, prompt and energetic.
-P-A-G-E-76
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 75 
2. By helping us to see and weigh the ab- 
solute importance within our scope. 
3. By putting a person in possession of him- 
self, giving him a victory over his spirit. 
4. By preventing indolence, vanity, presump- 
tion; folly, and selfishness, and promoting 
politeness and whatever is lovely and of good 
report. 
Your place in the great harvest field of life 
is entirely different from that of the male. The 
wide world is their field and its multiplied pur- 
suits present themselves for their choice both 
on sea and land. They may be the directors 
of the mighty ship that ploughs the ocean like 
a thing of life, leading armies to the field of 
battle, becoming the legislators and governors 
of states. But yours is a far different sphere. 
“Home,” in the beautiful language of another, 
is emphatically your world; the heart your har- 
vest field, and it is there your ambition must 
strive for empire. Although the scene of your 
labors is thus unostentatious, noiseless and 
retired; yet are your duties far from being un- 
important and irresponsible. The greatest ef- 
fects in nature are produced quietly and
-P-A-G-E-77
76 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
unobserved. The lightning by which the sturdy 
oak, ‘‘the lord of the forest,” is riven to its center 
is noiseless in its operation, and when the sound 
is heard the bolt has reached its destination and 
the ruin is insured. The electric fluid through 
whose agency we converse with our friends 
though severed from them thousands of miles, 
as though we stood with them face to face, is 
silent and unseen in its operations. It is in the 
quiet retirement of home that the foundation 
is laid for everything that is valuable in char- 
acter, solid in principle and pure in morals. 
To the intelligence, the refinement, and the 
virtue of our females is committed almost all 
we hold dear. 
I would not be understood as narrowing 
down the scene of your labors and influence to 
your own particular homes. For under the 
present condition of our being (as the author of 
moral acumen observes), there are everywhere 
and at all times sick to, be relieved, mourners to 
be comforted, ignorant to be taught, vicious to 
be reclaimed, and those by nature enemies of 
God, to be won back and reconciled to him.
-P-A-G-E-78
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 77 
Wesay to you that woman has a peculiar part 
to perform in each of these great and noble 
works. It is your duty to labor both physically 
and intellectually with the determination to 
benefit those connected with you in all the dif- 
ferent relations of life. God would have you 
an instrument in his hands for helping others. 
Be not like those who spend their whole time 
and strength with every energy of their minds 
in procuring fashionable and costly raiment for 
the ornamenting of themselves that they may 
merely delight and dazzle the eyes of all be- 
holders and elicit their praise and homage to 
their charms. 
These have mistaken or neglected the great 
object of life. They are a blight, a moral mil- 
dew to society whose example should be shunned 
by her who would wish at life’s close to look 
back upon it with any degree of satisfaction. 
Those showy accomplishments, to gain which 
thousands have been expended, fortunes sacri- 
ficed and years of the most precious portions of 
life consumed, fade in a day before the real 
duties of life.
-P-A-G-E-79
78 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
We wish you to go forth and meet these real 
duties and responsibilities as true educated 
women ought. 
“Rest not, inglorious rest unnerves the man. 
Struggle, ’tis God’s behest ; 
Fill up life’s little span 
With God-like deeds-—~it is the test; 
Test of the high born soul.” 
We wish you to go forth from these scenes 
of your intellectual culture with the determina- 
tion that your bosoms shall ever wear the robe 
of highborn honesty and that truth shall gird 
all thy secret acts with her— 
“Then Knowledge crown thy brow serene. 
With holy light shall glow, 
And rays of living radiance o’er a darkened world 
shall throw—” 
Remembering: 
“That Man’s acts proclaim nobility, and not the kingly 
crest, 
That she is the noblest who performs trying duties best.”
-P-A-G-E-80
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 79 
In conclusion—I would wish to point you to 
a destiny in unison with your noble nature. 
Avoid the agencies that bring remorse, and 
let life’s pages be traced with characters of vir- 
tue and when you appear at the final examina- 
tion that awaits both teachers and scholars may 
you receive from the Universal Judge the com- 
mendation that many daughters have done vir- 
tuously—but thou excellest them all.

ADDRESS DELIVERED TO THE YOUNG LADIES 
OF THE LAST GRADUATING CLASS OF 
THE MARY SHARP COLLEGE, OF 
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND 
NINETY-SIX 
You hold in your hands a: testimonial from 
the Trustees and Faculty of the Mary Sharp 
College, that there has been put into your hands 
a key by which you may unlock the storehouse 
of knowledge. It shows that you have com- 
pleted the curriculum of study prescribed by 
this institution, and have acquired that culture 
of intellect, that enables its possessor to under- 
stand the communications of the scholars of our 
own times and land, as well as those of classical 
antiquity, ancient Greece and Rome. By this 
diploma it is meant, that in the opinion of those 
whose signatures are appended to it, you are 
prepared to associate with the scholars of our 
land and times, without detriment to them, 
and with much benefit to yourselves.

But does all this indicate that your educa- 
tion is finished? Far from it—your literary 
and scientific culture should rather be consid- 
ered to have but fairly commenced. In fact, 
you have just passed beyond those formidable 
elementary barriers which enclose the fields of 
science, and forever shut out the indolent and 
unenterprising. 
Like Hannibal, when he paused on the sum- 
mit of the surmounted Alps, and looked over 
the smiling fields of Italy on whose conquest 
he had just prepared to enter; so you too, now 
May pause, and cast a glance backward over the 
hills and peaks you have ascended; may con- 
gratulate yourselves that behind you. lies the 
map of your difficulties, while before you, and 
within the attainment of your ease and pleasant 
exertion, smilingly beckons the reward of past 
labors. 
But Rome has not yet been conquered. Italy 
is not in. your possession; you are not yet schol- 
ars, in the full sense of the term and are far 
from being educated. Education is the work of 
a life time, even the endless ages of eternity. 
And how many young women, and young men
-P-A-G-E-83
82 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
also, standing as you do to-day, diplomas in 
hand, cease from that very moment, to use their 
intellect to acquire knowledge, or to investigate 
questions of thought, or scientific researches; 
and how comparatively profitless to them all 
the toils and struggles are, it may be, of quite 
a successful school career. Dress, fashion, ad- 
miration, indolence, and a thousand frivolities 
and foolish occupations of life, may seduce you 
to neglect all future opportunities of improve- 
ment, and thus you lose most of the advantages 
you have gained. 
And yet you need not, ought not. Study ~ 
should not be irksome to you, you should always 
keep some subject under consideration for your 
spare moments. Some truth should be ready 
for investigation, when you have an opportun- 
ity, to which the mind may revert with pleasure 
and profit. This will keep your reason and re- 
flections active, and the mental faculties will 
not grow rusty from disuse. You are prepared 
to select such a course of reading, from your 
acquaintance with the classic authors of your 
own language as shall fill your mind with 
pleasant and useful information, and furnish
-P-A-G-E-84
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 83 
for you, the most entertaining and agreeable 
companionship, in hours of loneliness, as well 
as most excellent guides and instructors, and 
the most disinterested friends. The spoken 
reproofs of those who love us best, chafe and 
hurt, too frequently, but the book that sets our 
faults and shortcomings before us, no matter 
how plainly and severely, never does. Read 
then, good books, by all means, and esteem them 
as your most sincere and useful friends. 
In all your aims, in all your endeavors, the 
key note to successful achievements is found 
in that passage your lips have so often repeated 
here: 
“Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy 
might.” 
No listless exertion, no half-way interest in 
anything, but work while you work, and rest 
while you rest. And to women it is given to 
walk mostly in the sequestered paths of life, to 
perform the little graceful acts that clothe ex- 
istence with beauty and make her presence so 
delightful. She needs not to look afar for her 
mission, for something worthy of her, and the 
opportunities she has had of preparing herself
-P-A-G-E-85
84 » DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
to perform some grand achievement. One’s 
mission is not to be sought after, it comes to 
her, lies right to one’s hand; and heart willing, 
and hand ready, she findeth it and doeth it with 
her might. And this it is, will give all her 
efforts value, will make them effective, and 
worthy of all care and painstaking, and will 
ensure a result always useful, often grand. 
It is this seeking to do something that shall 
attract notice, trumpet her name abroad and 
elicit praise from chance beholders, that has 
_ caused so much pithy satire to be written of 
women, who neglect the manifest duties of 
life, to become presidents of societies and get- 
ters up of clubs, for the amelioration of the 
conditions of the far-off people, while they en- 
tirely ignore the looking well to the ways of 
their own household. Such are the Mrs. 
Jellybys, who are all enthusiastic over the 
needs of the natives of Borodoola, Gha., while 
their own husbands and children eat poorly 
cooked food, and later rejoice in unwashed faces 
and ragged and dirty garments; their mother is 
too busy with more important matters, has not 
time to attend to such trivial concerns. Here
-P-A-G-E-86

you see ignorant, untrained minds seeking no- 
toriety. Such are not our students of the Mary 
Sharp. 
When Epaminondas, the great Theban gen- 
eral, was condemned to sweep the streets of 
Thebes, he said: 
“I will make it an honor to perform the duties of 
this office, hitherto held in such contempt.” 
And he did it by his faithful and effective 
discharge of that which pertained to it. The 
streets of the city were never so clean, nor the 
municipality in so good condition as while 
Epaminondas had charge of the duties of street 
sweeping. The office did not degrade him, but 
he so ennobled it, that it was ever after consid- 
ered an honor to be appointed to it. And that is 
the spirit in which you should take hold of the 
thousand and one ever recurring and too fre- 
quently irksome tasks of woman’s life. The 
spirit at once of resolution and of submission, 
of a stern resolve to conquer difficulties, and 
at the same time of a willingness, as the cate- 
chism has it, to do your duties in that sphere 
of life in which it has pleased God to call you. 
- And yet to all who think women’s life must 
be contained in and confined to a narrow bound,
-P-A-G-E-87
86 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
I would point them to the thirty-first chapter of 
Proverbs. What a field of labor for a woman 
is therein described, how enterprising she needs 
be if she accomplishes well the half of what 
God’s capable woman is described as perform- 
ing. To what a pinnacle, and prosperity, and- 
greatness would the nations of the earth attain, 
if all the women of all civilized lands were such 
as are therein described. 
You surely, my dear pupils, will not forget 
the lessons you have learned in God’s lovely 
word, as to the duties and privileges of your 
sex, and now that you leave these college walls, 
and go out to put these lessons into practice, 
may I not be certain, that wherever you are, 
and whatever you do, the world will be better 
for you having lived in it!

REMINISCENCES OF MARY SHARP COLLEGE 
Written for a Historical Meeting of the Daughters of 
the Confedracy 
The founding of Mary Sharp College was 
due in large measure to the efforts of Dr. J. R. 
Graves, the distinguished Baptist minister so 
well known throughout the South. Near the 
middle of the last century, his ministerial duties 
called him to Winchester, Tennessee. This 
town, quietly nestling at the foot of the Cum- 
berland Mountains, appealed to him as an ideal 
place for a girl’s school which should give to 
the daughters of the South the same educational 
advantages enjoyed by their brothers. His elo- 
quent pleas won not only members of his own 
denomination but also some of the prominent 
citizens of Winchester, among whom were 
Colonel A. S. Colyar and Judge Peter Turney. 
Plans were discussed and matured, and it 
was decided to open the school in the Baptist

church of Winchester, with Dr. Z. C. Graves, 
a brother of Dr. J. R. Graves, as principal. He 
was a stranger in Winchester, but the patrons 
of the school at once discovered that he was a 
“born teacher” whose enthusiasm and untir- 
ing energy meant success for the new enter- 
prise. The school soon grew to such proportions 
that more roomy quarters were necessary, and 
it was transferred to the new Baptist church, . 
which had been built in another part of the 
town. Here the enrollment of pupils continued 
to increase till more room was needed, and it 
was decided to erect a school building. 
Subscriptions were solicited with the under- 
standing that the most generous contributor 
should have the honor of naming the school. 
Mrs. Mary Sharp made the largest gift, and 
she named the school for herself. 
A suitable lot was purchased, and the new 
building was erected. After a few years, even 
this building failed to accommodate the ever 
growing student body, and the addition of two 
wings became necessary. Here Dr. Graves la- 
bored successfully till the opening of the Civil 
War.
-P-A-G-E-90
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 89 
In the spring of 1861, the enrollment ex- 
ceeded four hundred, the greater number of 
whom were from the South. Naturally, as all 
hope of peace between the two sections of the 
Union failed, and civil war was an assured fact, 
some of the pupils from the extreme South were 
called home, but the majority remained to pur- 
sue their studies. 
Dr. Graves had always held the respect and 
love of his pupils, and during those “‘troublous 
days” they grew to love him more and more 
because of his devotion to the Southern cause. 
Though a native of Vermont, his loyalty to 
the South could not be questioned. Zealous as 
he was in the school room, even his favorite 
classes in metaphysics were cheerfully dis- 
missed that he and his pupils might go out on 
the lawn to say good-bye to our soldiers as they 
marched away to war. 
One bright morning in May, the whole school 
assembled in front of the College to hear Judge 
—or rather, Colonel—Turney’s farewell speech 
before he went to the front. He had been Pres- 
ident of the Board of Trustees all these years. 
He was a man of magnificent physique, and as
-P-A-G-E-91
90 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
he rode into the grounds mounted on a beauti- 
ful horse, each throbbing heart in that group 
of girls felt sure that he could lead his troops 
only to glorious victory. Dr. Graves made a 
ringing speech which was cheered to the echo 
by the soldiers. Then Colonel Turney, his 
heart evidently stirred to its inmost depths and 
his face all aglow with the fire of love for the 
South, dismounted from his horse, and in a 
voice trembling with emotion, assured Dr. 
Graves that his eloquent, burning words, and 
the half-smiling, half-tearful faces of the girls, 
would be an inspiration to him and his brave 
men in the new experiences awaiting them; that 
the memory of this hallowed scene would be 
with them in the lonely hours of camp life, 
and nerve their arms in the hour of battle. As 
he mounted his horse and rode away, followed 
by his gallant soldiers, some of the girls sobbed 
quietly, but all felt in their hearts that such 
men and such a leader could never know defeat. 
After this, school work at Mary Sharp went 
on as usual up to the Commencement hour in 
June. The Graduating Class, to show their 
loyalty to the South, decided to wear homespun
-P-A-G-E-92
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 91 
dresses on that day. This they did, and the 
halls of old Mary Sharp never resounded with 
more thundering applause than greeted those 
young girls as they marched up the aisle of the 
crowded Chapel and took their places on the 
stage. 
During the years of the war, Dr. Graves con- 
tinued his faithful teaching without salary; but 
the dear old College never again welcomed the 
eager throng of students that crowded her halls 
in ante-bellum days. Conditions were such that 
the generous patronage of the extreme South 
was never renewed, and even young boys were 
admitted to swell the number of pupils. 
After the war, quite a number of bright and 
attractive women graduated from Mary Sharp, 
and many of them are with us to-day to help in 
the work of rebuilding the fortunes of dis- 
tracted America. May abundant success crown 
their loving service!

PIONEER HIGHER EDUCATION FOR WOMEN 
AS EXEMPLIFIED AT MARY SHARP COLLEGE 
To all those who are interested in the educa- 
tional history of Tennessee it is a matter of 
pride to know that this state was the American 
pioneer in higher education for women. This 
was exemplified in Mary Sharp College at Win- 
chester. Interest in this historic college is kept 
alive by its loyal graduates and their descend- 
ants. Nashville has a flourishing Mary Sharp 
College Club which meets regularly and which 
does excellent work. 
Those throughout the South who have asso- 
ciations with Mary Sharp, and many others as 
well, will be interested in an account of the 
splendid work of this institution written by the 
late James S. Taylor, president of Vassar Col- 
lege, and sent to the “Nashville Banner School 
Page” by Mrs. Hugh S. Embrey, of Hunts- 
ville, Alabama.

Those who are following the controversy 
raised by Ambassador Harvey’s recent an- 
nouncement, that there is no scriptural author- 
ity that women possess souls, will find a valu- 
able contribution to the thought on this sub- 
ject from a Mary Sharp pioneer for higher 
education for women. President Z. C. Graves, 
in a school catalogue in the early fifties, sets 
forth views more advanced than those held by 
the American Ambassador to the Court of St. 
James. Dr. Taylor says of Dr. Graves: 
“He makes an impassioned plea for women 
for more knowledge literary, scientific and 
classical that has been for so many generations 
the peculiar and cherished heritage of the other 
sex; for the placing of the sister on an equality 
with the brother in the development and un- 
folding of all the qualities of her mind.” Thus 
he makes her what she was designed by her 
Creator to be, a thinking, reasoning being, capa- 
ble of comparing and judging for herself and 
dependent upon none other for her free 
unbiased. opinion. 
The catalogue makes a further claim that 
when woman is thus completely educated, the
-P-A-G-E-95
94 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
axe will be laid at the root of all evil and a 
new era will begin to dawn on the human race. 
The writer brings out in the well-known verse 
of Pope: 
“A little learning is a dangerous thing; 
Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.” 
Dr. Taylor’s article referring to Mary Sharp 
College appeared in a pamphlet which was pub- 
lished in 1912 by ‘The Educational Review 
Publishing Company” and it was sent by the 
author to Mrs. Wiley S. Embrey, of Winches- 
ter, Tennessee. She was formerly Nannie Mere- 
dith, and was one of the first two graduates of 
Mary Sharp College. They received their 
diplomas in 1855. 
Dr. Taylor devoted a number of pages of 
his pamphlet, entitled “College Education for 
Girls in America Prior to the Opening of Vas- 
sar College,” to Mary Sharp College. Of Mary 
Sharp College, he states that it was a college 
founded expressly for women and was first 
known as “The Tennessee and Alabama Female 
Institute.” 
To the head of the college, Dr. Z. C. Graves, 
Dr. Taylor refers as follows: “He was a Ver-
-P-A-G-E-96
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 95 
monter and was a vital force in education, with 
ideals and ambitions.” 
Rev. J. Manton, a recent graduate of Brown 
University, was a professor of mathematics. 
He reported that he found classes in good con- 
dition, and to these girls of long ago he paid 
the following tribute: “They were young 
ladies whose attainments would compare favor- 
ably with classes at Brown University.” 
It was a serious effort far beyond the semi- 
naries of the early fifties to approach standards 
of the Northern colleges. It is interesting to 
read what is claimed by this pioneer from Ver- 
mont. His purpose was to give girls an educa- 
tion as thorough as their brothers had been 
acquiring at their colleges and universities. He 
lays great stress on permanency. It is no pri- 
vate school, it is a school for young ladies of a 
higher grade than was previously known to 
exist—in fact, a college where women may have 
the privilege of a classical education. 
“Tt is to be regretted that after its worthy 
stand, Mary Sharp College ceased to be. It 
was veritably a pioneer ten years before Vassar. 
It claims to be the first college for women that
-P-A-G-E-97
96 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
required both Greek and Latin for the A.B. 
degree. It was certainly the most developed 
curriculum of which we find clear evidence ten. 
years before Vassar opened and at that time 
there were no institutes for women in the North 
that claimed collegiate rank.”

XII 
Z. C, GRAVES, LL.D—SOME IMPRESSIONS 
In this age of highly specialized teaching we 
are sometimes in danger of losing sight of the 
humane element in the classroom. The fact 
remains, however, that the personal equation is 
a vital matter in all real teaching. The inspira- 
tional instructor, no matter where he may be, 
by transforming his work, amounts to a con- 
structive force, making for character and cul- 
ture. Great teachers are few because great per- 
sonalities are rare, and because enthusiasm is a 
variable quantity in most men. Now, it takes 
personality to make a teacher, and it takes en- 
thusiasm. Of course, by enthusiasm is not 
meant emotional ebullition, but a steady flame 
of vital energy; not dry-white light only. Cer- 
tainly a man must know his subject; indeed, 
he must know more than his subject. There is 
no discount on scholarship. But a great teacher 
must be more than a mere scholar. And aside 
C97]
-P-A-G-E-99
98 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
from technical scholarship, there is need of end- 
less reading if one would keep in touch with 
one’s age and be a discerner of tendencies. 
Moreover, sympathy, sympathy always—how 
else may one keep one’s primal freshness and 
renew one’s youth and understand youth? 
The other day there passed away at Winches- 
ter, Tennessee, a man who had a passion for 
teaching. It would be hard to say how many 
lives Dr. Z. C. Graves touched, or how many 
generations of Southern women, or, indeed, 
Southern men, through their mothers, he has 
helped to mould. Such spiritual forces are 
difficult to measure. In her palmy days old 
Mary Sharp College, with her classical, philo- 
sophical, mathematical, curriculum was some- 
what unique among the girls’ schools of the 
South. Some thinking was done there; we may 
be certain of that, even if scant notice was taken 
of the ‘‘accomplishments.” 
I met Dr. Graves in the fall of 1889. I was 
then teaching in a boys’ school at Murfreesboro, 
and Dr. Graves had just come over from Win- 
chester to take charge of the Presidency of 
Soule College, which Mr. J. G. Paty, with the
-P-A-G-E-100
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 99 
encouragement of leading Baptists in the town, 
had purchased from a Methodist minister. The - 
next year I became an instructor in Soule Col- 
lege, and for three years I was intimately 
associated with this venerable President. 
Age had not yet seriously impaired the vigor 
of his mind, which, for forty years had been 
exercised on problems of formal logic and 
general metaphysics. It was essentially an 
analytic order of mind fired with considerable 
polemic spirit. Dr. Graves was full of the best 
sort of intellectual curiosity. Not that kind of 
curiosity which concerns itself mainly with dia- 
lectic puzzles; but, rather, a passion for funda- 
mentals. Possibly there may have been at times 
a tendency toward rationalism, but the good 
heart of the man, and his abiding faith in the 
spiritual as well as his religious experiences, . 
saved him by restoring the supremacy of the 
spirit. He was never content with a superficial 
statement of truth for rhetorical or partisan 
effect. Hence it was that the grounds of his 
own belief he knew thoroughly; and, while a 
tolerant man, he, like all those who have souls 
sensitive to the delicate shading between over-

-P-A-G-E-101
100 DR. Z, C. GRAVES 
statement and understatement, was irritated by 
assertions which seemed to him to indicate 
ignorance of fundamental truths or indifference 
to moral distinctions. 
If, for example, a man with some new theory 
of physical phenomena visited the town, Dr. 
Graves was among the first to seek his acquaint- 
ance and to inquire into his methods. Hypno- 
tists were specially interesting to him for he 
himself claimed to have studied the subject of 
hypnotism somewhat critically. I recall the visit 
of an exceeding shrewd and plausible professor 
of this art. Dr. Graves attended his perform- 
ances and, as usual, became full of nervous 
interest in the matter; so much so, indeed, that 
he finally consented to an exhibition of the hyp- 
notist’s skill before his school in the chapel. 
But it so happened that the gentleman advanced 
some rather radical ideas, as Dr. Graves 
thought, and in order to illustrate the truth of 
them, wished to experiment on several of the 
students. Here the polemical spirit of the good 
doctor showed itself. He arose and argued 
somewhat lengthily against the new theories, 
largely on ethical and physiological (or, per-
-P-A-G-E-102
MARY SHARP COLLEGE "101 
haps, pathological) grounds, refusing point- 
blank to allow the hypnotist to proceed further. 
Those were unverified hypotheses, and the in- 
cident proved that no matter how far Dr. 
. Graves’ speculative instinct might lead him in 
purely academic discussion, when his own pro- 
fessional stewardship was involved, he was 
always conservative, alive to his personal 
responsibility. 
At heart this grand old man was as simple 
as a child and as tender as a woman. He loved 
boys and girls and dealt with them so reason- 
ably and so gently that the more thoughtful of 
them were glad to sit at his feet and learn. For 
he was a philosopher in the best sense—a lover 
of wisdom and a searcher after truth; a 
peculiarly open-minded man, eager for new 
ideas. His method was Socratic; in other 
words, he liked to lead you along by simple 
questions into new views of old truth, not so 
much by directly teaching you as by carrying 
you, as it were, to make the discovery for your- 
self. 
Dr. Graves’ range of information was re- 
markably wide. He was a close observer as
-P-A-G-E-103
102 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
well as an extensive reader; not so much in 
general literature, it seemed to me, as in popular 
scientific fields. He was a good botanist and a 
good geologist, though his great strength lay 
in logic and metaphysics. Naturally, his long 
continued meditation upon questions of specula- 
tive philosophy made him eccentric in the eyes 
of the average practical man. I suppose Ham- 
let, as viewed by the man of business absorbed 
in commercial life, is quite insane. There was, 
however, in Dr. Graves, a saving common sense; 
that levelheadedness of the New Englander, 
which no amount of dreaming or absorption 
in the infinite can utterly abolish or destroy. 
“Gladly would he learn, and gladly teach.” 
Like Goldsmith’s Village parson, this nine- 
teenth century teacher was “passing rich” on 
small wages, for I never knew a man who cared 
so little for money, or whose wants were fewer. 
And, whatever failings, he had surely leaned 
to virtue’s side. . 
There were those who did not agree with some 
of the views held by Dr. Graves. But I have 
_never known a man or woman who could accusé 
him of intellectual dishonesty or social insin-
-P-A-G-E-104
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 103 
cerity; and those who came in touch with his 
winsome personality, whether they accepted his 
conclusions or not, felt the impress of a friend 
of the spirit with whom it was good to talk of 
eternal problems which we are striving all our 
lives to solve. 
And, now, since his work is done we ask our- 
selves what he has especially stood for in his 
day and generation. He was a pioneer in the 
education of woman in the South, and he lived 
to see his dreams fulfilled. He did a work 
which was a distinct contribution to the educa- 
tional progress of the century, and his fame is 
secure. He will live again in minds made 
better by his presence. 
Eight years have passed since I bade fare- 
well to this gentle soul on a starlit night in the 
little Tennessee town where he lived and labored 
and loved. He himself has passed beyond the 
stars. He could have no more fitting epitaph 
than this: “The Delight of His Life He Found 
in Truth and in the Satisfaction which the En- 
joying of Truth Gives to the Spirit.”

MRS. MARY SHARP 
“Dear Nora: A letter from Rebecca March, enclos- 
ing a card from Mamie Matthews, reached me this morn- 
ing, and I am hastening to reply in order that you may 
have the desired information concerning my great aunt, 
Mary Sharp. 
Aunt Mary was a Miss Corn, a sister of my grand- 
mother. She married my grandfather’s brother, James 
Sharp. When Uncle James died my Aunt Mary freed 
eighty Negroes and paid their way to Liberia, Africa, 
that colony having been recently established for Ameri- 
can slaves of the Negro race who were liberated by their 
masters. Later, she gave the bequest out of which, as 
a nucleus, the Mary Sharp College grew, again evinc- 
ing her profound belief in freedom—this time, not of 
the body but of the mind. Not of the body of slaves— 
but of the minds of women. 
My earliest recollections of home are mingled with 
memories of Aunt Mary, tiny, blind and carefully 
dressed in black silk, with soft lace fichu and cap. She 
died poor, in my mother’s home, in 1864, the war 
having swept away the remainder of her fortune. My 
father passed on the year before. 
(1041
-P-A-G-E-106
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 105 
Aunt Mary never had any children, but she reared 
my father, his brother and sisters. She adopted Aunt 
Sue, my father’s baby sister, who later graduated at 
Mary Sharp College, and taught Latin there before the 
civil war. 
A large monument marks the grave of Uncle James 
and Aunt Mary, at the old homestead of the Sharps, a 
few miles from Winchester. A part of this stone had 
blown down when I visited the graves four years ago. 
Any of the Estill family at Winchester, Miss Beulah 
Wallace or Henry might visit the grave for a look at 
the monument, and supply information which I may have 
forgotten. 
Love to ‘The Girls.’ 
Affectionately,

WINCHESTER, SOME OF ITS CELEBRITIES, 
AND MARY SHARP COLLEGE 
Nestled down among gently undulating hills 
_on a plateau of the Cumberland mountains, is 
the historic little town, Winchester. The town 
site was given by Wallace Estill in 1801, and 
the first court held there was in 1809. It was 
in a log building, after Franklin County, 
named for Benjamin Franklin, was created by 
an act of the Legislature. The town itself was 
named for General Winchester, a revolutionary 
soldier and statesman from Virginia, and was 
incorporated in 1828. It is located on a branch 
of the N., C. & St. L. Railway, eighty-five 
miles from Nashville and seventy-two miles 
from Chattanooga. For many years the town 
has been famous for its schools, the earliest one 
of note being the old Winchester Female Acad- 
emy, established in the early thirties of a 
century ago. Next was the Biddle School, 
[107]
-P-A-G-E-109
108 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
established by the Presbyterians, and after that 
the Robert Donnell Institute. Then came 
Mary Sharp College and the Clark School, 
which was later merged into the Winchester 
Normal College. After the passing of those 
fine old institutions, a high school and public 
school were established there, and they are at 
present time taught in the buildings erected 
for the famous college. These institutions of 
learning have left an impress on the little town 
which only an educational life can render. 
Franklin County, politically, has been the 
home of leaders of the state for generations. 
Isham G. Harris and Hopkins L. Turney, both 
United States Senators, resided there. Two 
Governors had their homes and reared their 
families in its cultured atmosphere. Governor 
Turney, a son of Hopkins L. Turney, built him 
a home on the Decherd Road, and named it 
“Wolf’s Craig.” Winchester was the birth- 
place of Governor Peter Turney and was proud 
to claim him as her son, for he served four years 
in the Governor’s chair, after two decades on 
the Supreme bench. He was the brave leader 
.and organizer of Turney’s First Tennessee
-P-A-G-E-110
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 109 
Regiment, three months before Tennessee se- 
ceded, and it gave to the Confederate Army 
2,200 men. Diametrically opposite from 
“Wolf’s Craig” was located the home of Gov- 
ernor Albert S. Marks. It was appropriately 
named “Hundred Oaks” from a forest of mag- 
nificent oaks surrounding the residence. It 
was in a park of twenty-five acres. There were 
297 acres in the encompassing lands. 
In this home with his charming wife and two 
young sons, Governor Marks doubtless passed 
his happiest hours. It was there that the elder 
boy, Arthur, dreamed and planned what his 
days of maturity would bring, and there per- 
haps his mind pictured the touching little story 
of “Imogene,” which in later years he expressed 
so beautifully. Arthur Marks was born a poet, 
and possessed a wonderful delicacy of thought 
and expression. In 1898 he was offered a posi- 
tion in the Consular Service by ex-Governor 
Porter. He was Assistant Secretary of State, 
under President Cleveland, and gladly ac- 
cepted the position, gaining by the opportunity 
a means of visiting the Old World. In Scot- 
land, he met and married a Tennessee girl,
-P-A-G-E-111
110 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
Miss Mary Hunt, and returned to America in 
1888 and selected Winchester and “Hundred 
Oaks” for the erection of one of the most im-. 
posing edifices of the South. It combined all 
the conveniences of a modern home, with the 
stateliness and grandeur of an English castle, 
being planned from ideas he gained while 
abroad. A portion of the house is covered with 
ivy, the roots of which were brought from 
Kenilworth Castle. The library is an exact 
replica of Sir Walter Scott’s, and is perfect in 
every detail. It is paneled in oak and has a 
massive appearance while it is at once graceful . 
and antique. This gifted young man died in- 
the summer of 1892 with typhoid fever at his 
father’s summer home at Monteagle, Tenn. By 
his untimely and sad death Tennessee lost one 
of her brightest and most gifted young men. 
The lovely home passed into the hands of the 
Catholics. It is now the home of the Paulist 
Fathers, the only institution of the kind be- 
tween New York and California. Indeed, there 
are only three in the United States: one is in 
New York, one in San Francisco, and the third 
in Winchester. Father Marks Handley, who
-P-A-G-E-112
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 111 
was born and reared in Winchester, was no 
doubt the cause of its being located there. It is 
established as a home for the fathers of the 
South and Southwest and is the abode of a 
number of priests. 
Joe Campbell, a musical prodigy, who 
founded the first blind school in Europe, under 
the name of the “Royal Normal College,” was 
born in Winchester. He was invited to play 
before the crowned heads and was knighted by 
King Edward, as Sir Francis Joseph Camp- 
bell. 
Mrs. Ida Beasley Elliott, of Mandalay, Bur- 
mah, was decorated last year with the Distin- 
guished Service Medal by the order of Eng- 
land’s King for her notable achievements dur- 
ing eighteen years. The only Tennesseans who 
have been awarded Distinguished Service 
Medals were natives of Winchester. These 
two people are Mrs. Elliott, and Sir Francis 
Joseph Campbell. 
Winchester was the home of Major W. E. 
Venable, who was sent as United States Minis- 
ter to Guatamala and who died on shipboard 
before reaching there. He was one of the
-P-A-G-E-113
112 DR. Z. C. GRAVES" 
powerful factors in the development of Mary 
Sharp College, as was Colonel A. S. Colyar, an 
eminent jurist of Winchester, who rode horse- 
back to Murfreesboro in the interest of securing 
the school. He was a Franklin County man, 
one of Tennessee’s widely known editors. His 
final work was a history of the “Life of An- 
drew Jackson,” but he is remembered as being 
a member of the Confederate Congress from 
Tennessee, and for his instrumentality in the 
State’s coal and iron mines. 
The celebrities of Franklin County and of 
Winchester are by no means contemporaneous 
but are scattered all along through the years. 
Judge Arthur Crownover and Judge Floyd 
Estill, of Chattanooga, and I. W. Crabtree, of 
Memphis, all well known in a legal and politi- 
cal way, were Winchester men.

Dr. Harry Clark, a delightful teacher and 
finished speaker, is now official head of the 
Education Department of Furman University, 
at Greenville, South Carolina; and was for 
three years Secretary of the Baptist Educa- 
tional Work in Tennessee. He received a de- 
gree from Yale, as did Charlie and Nat Fran- 
cis, whose mother was Ellen Elliott, an alumna 
of Mary Sharp College. 
Two eminently successful teachers educated 
at the Winchester Normal were John Hopkins 
and Joe G. Estill. Professor Hopkins taught 
at Lake Placid in the summer and in Florida 
in the winter. He and his cultured wife have 
retired from the schoolroom and have an 
attractive Virginia estate. 
Professor Joe Estill, of Lakewood, New 
Jersey, has a school which prepares students 
for Yale. 
D. M. Coleman, the only blind representa- 
tive that Tennessee has ever had in its Legisla- 
ture, is a cultured musician and linguist. He 
is a Commissioner of the Blind School in which 
he was educated.

Judge Nathan Green was born in Winches- 
ter in 1827, and moved to Lebanon where his 
father occupied a position in Cumberland Uni- 
versity. The Green family was represented not 
only in the Revolution, the War of 1812, the 
Mexican War, but the War between the States. 
Quite as wonderful, its members have repre- 
sented the law for generations. The Senior 
Representative was a Judge of the Supreme 
Court, the son for more than fifty years iden- 
tified with the law department of Cumberland 
University, while the grandson is a member of 
the Supreme Court of Tennessee. 
Winchester has not only been prominent edu- 
cationally and politically but in later years 
Franklin County is one of the banner counties 
agriculturally and horticulturally. The old 
red hills now blossom as the rose. Waving 
fields of grain and alfalfa and crimson clover 
make the landscape as beautiful as a picture. 
At a cost of $50,000, the city government har- 
nessed the loop falls on Elk River and there 
established an electric and water-works plant. 
Winchester is the location of several nurseries, 
one owned and operated very successfully by

Miss E. B. Drake, the daughter of gentle, 
brown-eyed Nina Dufield, an alumna of Mary 
Sharp College in 1868. Winchester is a town 
of beautiful residences, banks, and lovely 
churches. The former Mary Sharp College 
building is cared for by the County and used 
as a public school building, the high school 
being taught in what was formerly the Win- 
chester Normal College, but which was origin- 
ally built for the Grammar School of the 
University of the South, located at Sewanee. 
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 
In a recent letter from Mrs. A. D. Trimble, 
one of the early Mary Sharp graduates and one 
of the fifteen students at its opening in the 
Court House in 1850, she tells us something of 
the school’s early happenings. To Dr. J. R. 
Graves, then a young but eminent minister, she 
ascribes the fact of Mary Sharp’s location in 
Winchester. Happening to be for a time in 
the quiet little hamlet with its shut-in location, 
its salubrious climate and its splendid water, 
he conceived the idea of founding a Baptist 
school for girls of the South, in response to an
-P-A-G-E-117
116 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
imperative demand for a broader and more 
thorough education for women. With the co- 
operation of Colonel Colyar, Governor Turney, 
Major Venable and a score of other prominent 
residents of Winchester, a school was estab- 
lished, an imposing edifice for those times was 
erected and Mary Sharp, the dream, became a 
reality. Through the influence of Dr. J. R. 
Graves, Dr. Z. C. Graves, his brother, was se- 
lected as President. Men of cultured and dig- 
nified station pronounced it the desé and only 
one of its kind in America, in that it gave 
women equal opportunities with men. 
On the fly leaf of an old catalogue of Mary 
Sharp College, of 1885-86, I found this article 
from John Eaton, Commissioner of Education, 
in Washington: 
“DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR 
Bureau or EpucaTion 
Washington, D. C., July 5, 1884. 
Dr. Z. C. GRAVES, 
President of Mary Sharp College, 
Winchester, Tenn. 
Sir: In reply to your letter of the 8th ult., making 
inquiry whether a diploma was ever given for a liberal
-P-A-G-E-118
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 117 
education (one in which Latin and Greek were required, 
as a sine qua non, for the degree of A.B.) before 1853, 
at which time the trustees conferred the degree upon 
three young ladies having completed the curriculum of 
the college, I beg to inform you that none of the col- 
leges for females reporting to this office required Latin 
and Greek as a sine qua nom for the degree of A.B. 
prior to 1853. 
I am your obedient servant, 
Joun Eaton, Commissioner.” 
This article was written to correct the state- 
ment which was going the rounds of the press, 
that Vassar was the oldest college for women in 
the United States. 
For two years during the Civil War the 
school was suspended and the three hundred 
girls, the flower of Southern womanhood, fled 
before an invading foe. General James A. Gar- 
field, afterwards President of the United 
States, had charge of the forces. The home of 
the writer’s grandfather, Mark Hutchins, 
which was opposite the Walmsley House, was 
used as Garfield’s headquarters. The two-story 
brick which stood in one corner of an entire 
block was occupied by his troops and the Mary 
Sharp College building was used for a stable
-P-A-G-E-119

and a hospital. For many years the depressions 
showed where the trenches were dug for drain- 
age around the tents of the Federal officers. 
Mary Sharp College was unique in that it 
had no set of rules. “Do right” was the em- 
bodiment of all; and broad, thorough culture 
its aim. The schoolroom was Dr. Graves’ work- 
shop, where he wrought in the precious gold 
work of Southern womanhood, the minds and 
hearts of its daughters. It need not be told 
with what skill he fashioned each vessel, which 
was brought into its most becoming shape, pol- 
ished it, ornamented it, and filled it to the brim 
from the clear waters of his own deep under- 
standing; and upon each that would receive it, 
he stamped the visible image and superscrip- 
tion of his own exalted character. Between 
Tennessee and the Gulf there were few house- 
holds which had not been beautified by some 
specimen of his handiwork. He raised the level 
of feminine purity and culture in the South by 
pouring into it the volume of his clear and con- 
secrated life. Of all those who were graduated 
there, very few failed to make good either as 
teachers’ wives or professional women. They
-P-A-G-E-120
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 119 
went forth with the imprint of the most finished 
picture of noble womanhood, as given in the 
thirty-first chapter of Proverbs, each filled with 
enthusiasm, and determination to measure up 
to the standard. , 
Dr, Graves had.a number of distinguished 
educators associated with him in his work, of 
whom only three are living. Prof. A. T. Bar- 
rett, for many years Professor of Mathematics, 
is still teaching. Professor C. F. Utermoehlen, 
formerly at the head of the Music Department, 
lives in Fort Worth, Texas, and Professor E. 
M. Gardner lives in Nashville, Tennessee, who 
for years had charge of the Art Department. 
The College had been built up around Dr. 
Graves, and he was its inspiration. It was 
not endowed and when he grew too feeble with 
age to carry on the work, no one else seemed 
at hand to pick up the shuttle as it fell from his 
hands. 
In May, 1902, Dr. Graves passed away after 
a pilgrimage of eighty-six years. The grand 
old educator, who had sent four thousand girls 
from the College halls to fill the various posi- 
tions to which destiny called them, each with
-P-A-G-E-121
120 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
love in her heart for the kind instructor, passed 
quietly away. He loosed the sandals from his 
tired feet and laid down to rest. Under the 
shade of the trees in the Winchester cemetery, 
he is sleeping beneath a shaft of marble erected 
by his loving pupils. Though he is gone, his 
influence still lives in the lives he touched. 
Two other of the Winchester girls, long since 
grown to womanhood, are making their homes 
in a foreign land. Mrs. Dana Slaughter Mil- 
ler, who has the chair of English in the Shang- 
hai Baptist College, is a missionary of note. 
Mrs. Ada Payne Hereford, a Presbyterian 
missionary of Hiroshima, Japan, recently en- . 
tertained one of our club members, Mrs. Bell 
Murrell Pinson, on her tour through the East 
with her distinguished husband, Dr. W. W. 
Pinson, Secretary of the Board of Southern 
Methodists, and author of the Centenary 
Movement. He had the degree of D.D. confer- 
red upon him by the State University of Geor- 
gia on its hundredth anniversary. The Uni- 
versity of Dallas, Texas, in 1925, conferred the 
degree of LL.D. 
Mrs. Alex Kascis Anderson, of Washington, 
still delights the public with her charming
-P-A-G-E-122
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 121 
verses and poems. The granddaughter of the 
late Mrs. Nannie Meredith Embrey, who was 
one of the two in the first graduating class of 
Mary Sharp College, has achieved distinction 
in chemistry. Miss Hartley Embrey secured 
her degree at Chicago University and was em- 
ployed as chemist at Old Hickory Powder 
Plant during the World War. Afterwards she 
was sent to Union Medical College at the 
Rockefeller Foundation in Peking, China. 
Since that time she has done research work for 
the Filipino lepers as a dietitian, at the request 
of the United States Government. 
Mrs. Sallie Crutchfield Gaut, a student of 
Mary Sharp, has a daughter, Sarah M. Gaut, 
at the Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, 
who has taught for six years the soldiers who 
were maimed and wounded in the World War 
to specialize in jewelry and craftwork. She 
has brought happiness into darkened lives and 
taught them the glorious privilege of feeling 
independent.

THE ARGONAUTS 
Dr. Graves did not favor Sororities, but in 
1876, a Literary Society was organized by the 
senior class. The society was called ‘The 
Argonauts.” 
The emblem of the society was a shield, en- 
graved with one of Jason’s ships, having at- 
tached to it an anchor by a small golden chain. 
The motto was “Steer Clear of Breakers.” 
Meetings were held every two weeks. No 
feasts were allowed, but the society gave a “pay 
entertainment” annually, and the proceeds were 
given to the library of the college. 
The best articles, written by the seniors, were 
copied on suitable paper, and tied together, for 
preservation. This was called “The Log 
Book.” 
A PAGEANT—EVOLUTION OF SOUTHERN WOMEN 
A few years ago, Miss Virginia Howlett, the 
secretary of Randolph-Macon Alumnae Asso- 
[122]
-P-A-G-E-124

ciation, sought information of Mrs. Emmett 
Cooper, the corresponding secretary of the 
Mary Sharp College Club, by means of which 
it might be possible to work up a pageant on 
“The Evolution of Southern Women.” 
When this information was supplied, it was 
decided to feature the “Argonauts” as the fun- 
damental idea. The float bore “The Argo,” 
upon which was a woman, dressed in Grecian 
costume. She bore in each hand a scroll, one 
representing Homer’s Odyssey; the other 
Virgil’s AEneid, typifying Mary Sharp’s 
requirement of Latin and Greek. 
Upon the scarf and around the body of the 
maiden was inscribed “MARY SHARP COL- 
LEGE, 1850-1896.”

THE MARY SHARP COLLEGE CLUB OF NASH- 
VILLE, TENNESSEE 
On the afternoon of February 28, 1920, a 
group of former Mary Sharp students were en- 
tertained at the home of Mrs. A. F. Mathews 
in honor of her guest, Miss Rebecca March, 
of Fayetteville, Tennessee. The guest list 
included Mrs. E. W. Holman, Mrs. John M. 
Gaut, Mrs. N. S. Brannan, Mrs. W. D. Tem- 
ple, Mrs. Henry Walmsley, Mrs. Enoch El- 
liott—(a visiting missionary from Burma)— 
Mrs. W. W. Pinson, Mrs. A. C. Taylor and 
Mrs. O. L. Hailey, niece of Dr. Z. C. Graves, 
who for so many years was President of Mary 
Sharp College. 
It was a most enthusiastic and delightful 
reunion and the kind hospitality dispensed was 
greatly appreciated and enjoyed. 
Mrs. Hailey and Miss March had both spent 
a number of years in Dallas, Texas, and were 
(1247
-P-A-G-E-126
MARY SHARP COLLEGE 125 
members of a Mary Sharp College Club there, 
of which they gave a glowing account. 
Miss March, acting as presiding officer, asked 
for a vote as to whether we should then and 
there organize ourselves into a society to be 
known as the Mary Sharp College Club of 
Nashville, Tennessee, in honor of our Alma 
Mater, the first college for women established 
in the South whose curriculum was substan- 
tially the same as that for men. 
Miss March asked for nominations which re- 
sulted in the election of the following officers: 
President, Mrs. O. L. Hailey. 
Vice-President, Mrs. John M. Gaut. 
Recording Secretary, Mrs. W. D. Temple. 
Treasurer, Mrs. A. C. Taylor. 
Publicity Secretary, Mrs. N. S. Brannan. 
The first regular meeting of the club was 
held with the President at her home, 1807 
Acklen Avenue, March 12, 1920. 
A newspaper invitation had been extended to 
all Mary Sharpers in.the city who desired to do 
so to join us. At that time the following new 
members were received : 
Mrs. J. R. Graves, Mrs. W. D. Johnston, 
Mrs. G. C. Savage, Mrs. R. M. Hall, Mrs. W.
-P-A-G-E-127
126 DR. Z. C. GRAVES 
O. Winstead, Mrs. Emmett Cooper, Mrs. J. A. 
Herman, Mrs. T. M. Robinson, Mrs. G. H. 
McCombs, Mrs. Rush Hawes and Miss Jennie 
Lauderdale. Mrs. Emmett Cooper at this meet- 
ing was elected Corresponding Secretary. We 
had not all attended college at the same time, 
yet there was from the beginning a strong tie 
which drew us together with hearts filled with 
loyalty to Mary Sharp College, and a mutual 
interest in each other. 
In answer to the question as to how the club 
came into existence I am sure you all agree that 
it was through the hospitality of Mrs. Mathews 
and the enthusiastic accounts Mrs. Hailey and 
Miss March gave of the club meetings in Dal- 
las, Texas. 
The membership continued to grow till the 
secretary’s book contained the following names: 
Mrs. A. F. Mathews (Mamie McGrew). 
Mrs. O. L. Hailey (Nora S. Graves). 
Mrs. John M. Gaut, (Sallie Crutchfield). 
Mrs. N. S. Brannan (Almeda Tillman).

Mrs. Henry Walmsley (Anna Wilkinson).

the alumnz and student body of Mary Sharp 
College assembled in the parlors of the College 
at nine o'clock on the morning of May thirty- 
first, 1910, to discuss ways and means for the 
organization of an Alumne Association of 
Mary Sharp College. 
Mrs. P. H. Manlove, of Nashville, Tennes- 
see, was appointed temporary chairman, Mrs. 
B. G. Slaughter, of Winchester, Tennessee, 
temporary secretary. 
The name of “The Association of Alumne

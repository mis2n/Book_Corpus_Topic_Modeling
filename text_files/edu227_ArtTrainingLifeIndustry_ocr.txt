PREFACE 
77 IS the hope of the author that this book 
will stimulate clearer thinking about art and 
the place of art in American home and commu- 
nity life, and especially, art in American educa- 
tion. He hopes, also, that it may help in making 
more evident to American manufacturers, mer- 
chants, legislators and educators the importance of 
building up an efficient system of art education 
which will be national in scope and thoroughly 
American in its organization and ideals. 
It is quite generally conceded that art has not 
yet come to its own in America, though it is well 
onthe way. Possibly these few chapters may serve 
to accelerate its motion just a little. 
Acknowledgments are due to Frank N. Emer- ©

gestions; and to The American Magazine of Art

Appreciation of art is not the 
same as knowledge of art. It is 
not something that can be ab- 
sorbed from books, or even from 
teachers; it is something that 
must be gained through experi- 
ence. To know many facts about 
works of art, to learn the names 
of artists, to be familiar with 
events in the lives of painters and 
sculptors and craftsmen, even to 
be personally acquainted with’ 
artists and with the character of 
their works, is not to appreciate 
art. The essence of art apprecia- 
tion is not primarily a matter of 
the intellect, but of the emotions.

The Essence of Art Appreciation 
22a) HE flames in the fireplace were eagerly 
consuming the bark of the two black 
)| walnut limbs I had just thrown upon 
the fire when the door-bell rang, and 
in came my friend, John Malton. 
Although he is always a welcome visitor, he 
was especially so on this cool October evening, 
for I had just been reading Morris Gray’s ad- 
dress at the semi-centennial celebration of the 
founding of the Metropolitan Museum, and I 
wanted to talk it over with John. I like to make 
use of Malton’s ideas as a means of checking up 
my own, because he has such a quick and sure 
perception of what constitutes beauty. And, be- 
sides, he is one of the few painters I know who 
spent enough time in college to get a philosophical 
viewpoint while acquiring the technic of his art. 
His attitude on the vital questions of art is far 
more satisfactory to me than that of Dr. Schulte, 
professor of art at the College, who always dis- 
cusses art as though it were a science.

  12 ART TRAINING FOR LIFE 
“Well, John,” said I, as soon as he was well set- 
tled in our biggest arm chair, “what have you 
found today that interests you?” 
“That is just what I came over to tell you. You 
know that bunch of sumac bushes on the ridge near 
the south end of Edgewood Park? Well, I went 
over there this morning. The leaves have all 
fallen, because of the early frost, but the bright 
red stems remain, and the branches reflect the bleu 
celeste of the sky. Beneath is the dull green of the 
frost-bitten leaves and beyond are the purple tops 
of some leafless trees which soften the sky-line. It 
is a fine bit of color. You must go and see it. I 
am going over to paint it tomorrow.” 
“Tl be delighted to go. And, why don’t you 
take Schulte along too and expose him to your 
beauty spot? It would be interesting to see how 
he would react.” 
With a smile and a twinkle the reply came back, 
“T don’t have to take Schulte over there to know 
how he will react. He wouldn’t see my picture at 
all in that bunch of sumac. It would be just an 
ordinary bunch of leafless bushes to him. In order 
to be courteous he might say, ‘Yes, very interest- 
ing,’ and then he would begin to quote from that 
lecture of his on Corot and the Barbison School 
in which he classifies all the French landscape 
painters of the 19th century, lists the paintings of 
Corot and tells you how many times Corot painted
-P-A-G-E-13
  THE ESSENCE OF ART APPRECIATION 13 
his favorite tree leaning toward the right and how 
many more times leaning toward the left. You 
probably recall what emphasis he places on the fact 
that Corot’s mother was a Paris dressmaker and 
his father was a book-keeper, and how minutely 
he tries to describe the life in the little Corot shop 
and home on the Rue du Box, and how he espe- 
cially delights to repeat that story told by Silvestre, 
one of Corot’s biographers. You remember it :— 
To illustrate how slow and inefficient he was in 
drawing when he went to. Rome to study, Corot 
said, ‘Two men would stop to chat. I would be- 
gin to sketch them bit by bit, starting with the head, 
for instance. Then they would part, and all I had 
on my paper was sundry bits of heads. Or chil- 
dren would be sitting on the steps of some church, 
and again I would begin, only for the mother to 
call them away. Thus my sketch-book was full of 
tips of noses, foreheads and locks of hair.’” 
“This is the kind of stuff,” continued Malton, 
“that the Doctor is giving in the name of art ap- 
preciation. I protest. There is no art in it. I 
don’t believe Dr. Schulte ever enjoyed the luxury 
‘of a real art emotion in his life. How could he? 
He never had any art experience. He was born 
on an Illinois farm, went to a country school, and 
later, at the nearest small college, distinguished 
himself in Greek. After two years of teaching 
language he went to Europe for a year of gradu-
-P-A-G-E-14
  14 ART TRAINING FOR LIFE 
ate study and travel. There he became interested 
in archaeology and in the products of art as he 
found them in the museums. He was a great 
reader and collected a tremendous amount of in- 
formation about art and artists and schools of art, 
and his particular delight at the present time is to 
determine whether a dust-covered painting from 
somebody’s garret is a famous old master or a 
base imitation. Yet the College pretends that he 
is teaching art appreciation. Impossible! He 
hasn’t the first fundamental qualification. Art ap- 
preciation is an emotional experience in the pres- 
ence of beauty, not an intellectual reaction to facts 
and dates and figures and opinions.” 
Malton stopped as if to await my comment. I 
took the opportunity. ‘You are right, John, but 
aren’t you a little hard on the Doctor and his 
course? Do you mean that the College ought to 
abolish Dr. Schulte’s course? Don’t the students 
get something out of it?” 
“Not much,” was the reply. “At any rate, it 
should not be called ‘Art Appreciation.’ They 
might call it ‘Art Statistics.’ ” 
“But, who would take a course in ‘Art Statis- 
tics?” ” I observed. 
“That’s the point,” came back from Malton. 
“But,” he continued, “there really is something 
good in the course for a student who has had the 
foundation experience; who already has the right
-P-A-G-E-15
THE ESSENCE OF ART APPRECIATION 15 
emotional reactions; who really recognizes and 
loves the beautiful. For such, or better, for those 
who are acquiring this experience, some of the 
facts about artists, and schools and distinguishing 
characteristics are valuable. They furnish a back- 
ground of contrast. What I object to is feeding 
the husks and withholding the corn.” 
I had been watching for a good opportunity to 
quote Mr. Gray, so I said, ‘I wonder if you have 
seen the address of Morris Gray on ‘The Real 
Value of Art.’” 
As I did so, I reached over the table and picked 
out the August number of The American Maga- 
zine of Art and read these lines, doing a little 
underscoring of my own as I read them :— 
The knowledge of art is common. But the Jove of art 
that brings real happiness and -inspiration to the heart of 
man is rare. One is an intellectual interest. The other is a 
great emotion. Think not that this development of the love 
of beauty is necessary for the poor and uneducated only. It 
is necessary and in fully as high degree for the rich and edu- 
cated. It applies . . . . often to those who, possessing great 
works of art, think that a knowledge of prices, of names, of 
schools, of technique, means a love of art. It is not so. If 
you have that and only that you may have knowledge. But 
love lies far beyond. Before a great painting or a great 
sculpture the real love of art manifests itself not in the 
clever criticism that one hears so often at an afternoon tea 
or at evening around the dinner table. It manifests itself 
rather in silence—the silence that is like the hush that one 
feels when one stands in the cathedral of an alien faith hal- 
lowed by the worship of many generations. It manifests it-
-P-A-G-E-16
  16 ART TRAINING FOR LIFE 
self rather in the clutch at your heart, in the mist in your 
eyes. It is the Jove of art, not merely the knowledge of art, 
that is the great thing. 
“Hear, hear!’ said Malton, with real English 
fervor, and I proceeded: 
Yet the development of this love of beauty has not only 
a value to the happiness of the individual, it has a value to 
the welfare of the nation. The things that are material: 
the house, the food, the clothing, the business—what you 
choose—tend to differentiate us. The things of the spirit 
tend to bring us together. It is not on the things that are 
material, it is on the things that are spiritual that the great 
kinships of life, the great kinships of the world are founded.” 
I closed the magazine. Malton was looking into 
the fire. He did not reply for several seconds. 
He seemed to be letting the ideas of the quota- 
tion flow on through the natural channels of his 
thought. Then he said, slowly, ‘This is the gospel 
that must be preached and practiced in America 
if we are ever going to be more than pretenders 
at art appreciation. We rejoice in the rapid de- 
velopment of our museums of art, and well we 
may, but if those who guide us in art matters do 
not lead us to love beauty and not merely to talk 
and to write about it, we shall fail to reach our 
artistic expectancy as a nation.” 
Malton rose to leave. As we shook hands he 
said, “Don’t forget to come over tomorrow and 
see the bunch of sumacs.”
-P-A-G-E-17
  Chapter II. A Practical Philosophy of Art 
Appreciation 
Sy} HE next day after Malton’s visit I was 
walking with him in the Park. Earlier 
in the day I had seen his sketch of the 
bunch of sumac and admired it, and 
just now I had seen the spot that gave 
him the inspiration. As we talked of the color 
scheme of the picture I was in some way reminded 
of the color sensations of an evening aboard the 
Santa Fe train several years ago while coming 
across the Mohave Desert: 
“Tt was at the end of a winter day. For two 
or three hours I sat looking out upon the pano- 
ramic view, watching the changing colors and at 
the same time being conscious of the effect of the 
color changes upon my own feelings. At first the 
main color in the foreground was sage green; the 
middle distance was a subdued yellow; the foot- 
hills beyond were varied shades of violet; and the 
distant mountains were blue. In full sunlight the 
yellow of the middle distance was spotted with 
patches of red bushes. 5

18 ART TRAINING FOR LIFE 
“Looking ahead, as the evening glow was be- 
ginning to deepen, there appeared to be a blue lake 
in front of us toward which we kept going and go- 
ing, but we never reached it. It was a mirage. 
“As the sun dropped lower down behind the 
mountain all the sand of the entire picture became 
rose color instead of yellow and this was spotted 
with just the right tones of green and sage to sat- 
isfy, and to me the glow of color became a glow of 
spirit also. A little later the rose-and the sagé 
deepened into violet, but the green retained its 
color till the dusk of the evening blended sand and 
sage and green bushes and sky, and I saw two 
tones, the lighter of which was the sky. Later a 
dull moon rose. Then I thought I understood 
just a little of what is meant by the ‘spirit of the 
desert.’ ” 
I ended my account by saying that I wished I 
had the skill to paint the desert. 
“Do you know?” said Malton, ‘“‘that no painter 
can ever represent such a scene as that? You spent 
several hours in getting your impression of the 
‘spirit of the desert’; the painter has to select one 
instant only and he succeeds or fails by whatever 
of that spirit he can put into such a tiny cross- 
section of time. What he selects must therefore 
include more that represents the spirit than he 
would ever be likely to find in Nature at any one 
time, and probably very much less of detail than
-P-A-G-E-19
  PHILOSOPHY OF ART APPRECIATION 19 
he would ever see if he did not look with the eye 
of the artist. The artist, guided by his experience 
in recognizing things of the spirit, or as Benedetto 
Croce would say, things beyond the realm of physi- 
cal’fact, sees beauty. In order to express spirit 
the artist must see spirit, not merely facts.” 
“Do you recall that large painting of California 
foothills that hangs in the college library? The 
artist never saw the hills look just like that; no- 
body ever did; yet they are California foothills 
in spirit and in truth. In some way the painting 
transcends the reality. I was in the artist’s Chi- 
cago studio soon after he painted that picture and 
he showed me forty or more small sketches he had 
made among the foothills of California the sum- 
mer before. They were of the mountain tops and 
hillsides, the trees, the bushes, the paths and the 
sky, painted at different times. - They were as near 
like nature as he could make them. These fresh 
bits of California were the raw material out of 
which came the idealized, spirit-revealing, beauti- 
ful canvas painted in Chicago.” 
We had come to a favorite spot in the Park— 
a grass-covered bank under some white oaks that 
overlooked a little willow-protected stream. As 
we sat down I remarked that hereafter I should 
appreciate that painting of the California foothills 
more than ever_ before 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
  20 ART TRAINING FOR LIFE 
“Perhaps,” said Malton, “but not merely be- 
cause I have told you this incident of the artist’s 
method of working. If you had not used paints 
yourself; if you had not lived with paintings and 
loved them, that story wouldn’t be much of a con- 
tribution to your art appreciation. That is just 
like Schulte’s story of Corot’s sketch-book full of 
noses, foreheads and locks of hair; it is merely 
about art. It is like the silk of the corn that at- 
tracts attention; it is not even like the husks that 
hold the ear of golden kernels.” 
“We keep coming back to this,” said Malton, as 
he leaned against the nearest tree. ‘‘If people are 
going to appreciate art they must be given some 
kind of art experience. You can’t purchase art ap- 
preciation in book form any more than you can 
friendship or religion; it is not a marketable com- 
modity. Appreciation is a growing thing—an 
organism that requires time and nourishment and 
exercise for its development, and in its essentials 
it is non-transferable.” 
“But what do you mean by experience?” I 
asked. ‘Do you mean that a man must be a 
painter in order to appreciate painting?” 
“No, not exactly that,” Malton replied. “But 
I do believe that in order to really appreciate 
painting as an art he must, as Carlton Noyesisays, 
familiarize himself in some measure with the 
means of expression which the painter employs,’
-P-A-G-E-21
  
ve 
PHILOSOPHY OF ART APPRECIATION 21 
and the quickest and most effective way to acquire 
this familiarity is to work with brush and pigments 
under the guidance of a teacher who is also a 
painter. Until a man experiences some of the 
technical difficulties in producing desired effects he 
cannot really appreciate the work of the master 
who has produced those effects with apparent 
ease.” 
“Then, in order to have all the people appreci- 
ate painting you would have-to make painting a 
required subject in the public schools.” 
“Exactly so,” was the quick reply. “We have 
begun to do that already in many of. our ele- 
mentary schools. Only we have not done it with 
its purpose clearly enough in mind. We have 
taught the children to use transparent water colors 
and sometimes we have given them experience in 
tempera, and occasionally in oil colors, but too 
often the teachers have been $0 interested in find- 
ing a few children with special ability in art work 
that they have forgotten the great service they can 
render by giving to all the children the funda- 
mental experiences which may serve as a basis for 
real art appreciation.” 
“This sounds very well,” said I, “if the experi- 
ence in painting would serve for all the other forms 
of art, but, if the public schools are to give funda- 
mental experiences in sculpture, and architecture, 
and needlecraft, and bookbinding, and art metal-
-P-A-G-E-22
22 ART TRAINING FOR LIFE 
work, and all the rest of the manual arts, what 
would happen to the languages, to mathematics 
and the sciences?” 
I confess I was feigning a little, but I wanted 
to draw him out on this point. 
“T don’t think we need to worry about them; 
they are in no danger. The schools of a nation 
always reflect the life and ideals of that nation. 
As the people of this nation recognize the value of 
art in life and the importance of laying the foun- 
dations of appreciation of the various forms of 
art during the school period, they will demand that 
the technique of the more common forms of art 
expression be found in the schools. They will very 
generally require, as some are doing now, that cer- 
tain typical forms of art be taught in the primary 
grades as an essential part of the activities, the 
means of expression of that period of child devel- 
opment. They will provide for a variety of more 
definitely technical applications of the arts in the 
junior high school period, and a more intensive 
study of a few of the arts in the senior high school. 
They will provide more museums and more oppor- 
tunities for study after the school period, for the 
development of appreciation is an endless process 
unless we consider that it terminates with this life. 
And, because it is a continuous, a growing experi- 
ence, and because it concerns the higher things in 
life—the finer emotions, it is a constant source of 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
    PHILOSOPHY OF ART APPRECIATION 23 
joy. And, because each person’s appreciation is 
the result of his own individual experiences, of his 
own trials and errors, observations and reflections, 
searchings and successes, it gives spice and flavor 
and keen satisfaction. True appreciation of art 
enriches life.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-24

-P-A-G-E-25
  Chapter III. The Education of Art Appreciators 
: HERE are two main reasons for edu- 
cating in art: The first is to increase 
number of appreciators of art and art 
products; the second is to multiply the 
number of artists or workers who ‘are 
skilled in art processes. 
The appreciators are those who experience sat- 
isfaction in beholding works of art or in possessing 
beautiful things’made with human hands or with 
machines under the control of human minds and 
emotions. They are those who are conscious of 
the presence of beauty in design, in curve, in color 
combinations; they are the ones who frequent art 
museums, who seek out the choicest patterns in tex- 
tile materials and home decorations; they admire 
fine buildings and fine books and paintings, color- 
ful gardens and pageantry, exquisite jewelry and 
sculptured marble; they are sensitive to beauty in 
many forms. The appreciators are the real con- 
sumers of art products. 
25 ‘D
-P-A-G-E-26
  26 ART TRAINING FOR LIFE 
The workers who turn out the art products are 
relatively few in number but they possess the tal- 
ent, the taste, the designing ability, the skill of 
hand, the knowledge of processes that enables 
them to add beauty to things of utility. They have 
the power to record some of their emotions in ma- 
terial form so that they can be transmitted to other 
human beings whose emotions are tuned to catch 
the message. The worker—the true art crafts- 
man—is the transmitter of the message of beauty, 
while the appreciator is the receiver of the message. 
The worker, it is often said, possesses creative 
skill. Yet, more and more, it seems to be evident 
that there is a creative side to the training of the 
appreciator—the user, the consumer of art. The 
person who wears beautiful garments or arranges 
objects of beauty in decorating a store window or 
makes use of type and stock ornaments in compos- 
ing a page of advertising must to some degree be 
a creative artist. Moreover, in these fields of art 
activity an adequate degree of appreciation cannot 
come without the exercise of some creative effort 
because appreciation is not a general quality of 
mind and feeling so much as it is an intellectual 
and emotional reaction ii the presence of specific 
types of art products, as jewelry, needlework, 
wrought iron work, sculptured ornament, mural 
painting and many others. Art appreciation just 
as truly as mechanical appreciation, must come
-P-A-G-E-27
  EDUCATION OF ART APPRECIATORS 27 
from experience with specific products, processes 
and materials. 
If this is true, then the problem of training the 
appreciator or consumer of art products, as well 
as training the producer of art wares, is solved 
only by giving the students experience in the vari- 
ous materials and processes, the possible forms, 
colors, arrangements of the several kinds of art 
products that enter into modern life and living con- 
ditions. The appreciation of the art in textiles, 
for example, cannot come wholly from learning to 
draw plaster casts of the human figure nor from 
the pursuit of the ordinary college course ,in the 
history of art. It has to come thru experience 
and observation and study of textile materials and 
processes and products, and thru the use of tex- 
tile products and of forms appropriate in textile 
design and of colors of textile materials. Likewise, 
appreciation of the fine art of wood-carving cannot 
come wholly from experience in the painting of 
landscapes or the study of miniatures. To ap- 
preciate art in textiles one must have experience 
with textiles, whatever else he may have that will 
help enrich his appreciation. To appreciate the 
art of wood-carving, one must have some experi- 
ence with wood-carving. 
It follows, then, that to determine what forms 
of art craftsmanship should be taught to equip art 
appreciators of today adequately one should seek 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  28 ART TRAINING FOR LIFE 
first to find out what forms of art are found in the 
life and living conditions of today, rural as well 
as urban. 
A very superficial examination of the streets and 
the stores of our cities and of the homes in which 
we live and the clothes we wear will reveal art 
products and would-be art products which may be 
classified as follows: 
1. Posters, lettered cards and signs, painted 
bill-board advertisements, electric signs and trans- 
parencies. 
2. Stage settings, store window displays, and 
mural decorations. 
3. Printed title pages and display advertise- 
ments. 
4. Gardens and products of the art of land- 
scaping through the planting of shrubs, flowers 
and trees. ; 
5. Buildings involving the applications of the 
principles of good architectural construction and 
decoration. 
6. House furnishings—furniture, floor and 
wall coverings, etc. 
7. Easel-pictures, paintings, etchings, etc. 
8. Sculpture and sculptured ornament. 
9. Clothing and millinery. 
10. Photographs and photo-engravings. 
11. Pottery, tiles, ornamental work in clay, 
cement, and other materials. 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  EDUCATION OF ART APPRECIATORS 29 
If these are among the arts of our modern life, 
and if they are worthy to be continued, and ought 
to be appreciated, some experience in these are ap- 
propriately gained in school. In fact, the school 
that trains appreciators of these arts must provide 
for experience in these arts in its curriculum. Why 
not? To illustrate, is there any reason why the 
fundamentals of the art of landscaping should not 
be taught in the schools? The pupils of every 
high school—rural as well as urban—would profit 
by a study of this form of art. They would learn 
the different styles of artistic planting; they would 
observe the characteristics of the foliage of various 
trees and shrubs at different times in the year; 
they would learn the charm of formal planting in 
emphasizing the characteristics of stately build- 
ings, and, to quote from a professional, “the satis- 
fying beauty of the naturalistic planting which ties 
together building and grounds, transforming them 
into a magnificently set jewel.’ They would find 
out that they can play with walks and drives and 
flower beds and shrubbery screens and tones of 
berries and seed pods and spots of evergreens in 
working out the garden of their imagination; they 
would learn how to paint a picture with masses of 
foliage and flowers instead of pigments; and while 
doing so, they would learn to apply those eternal 
principles of all the space arts; simplicity, bal- 
ance, harmony and unity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  30 ART TRAINING FOR LIFE 
As to the possibility of such art training func- 
tioning either in appreciation or occupation, there 
is no question. And what a transformation a 
single generation would bring in our town door- 
yards and squares, and in our farm-yards, too, if 
every high school student would learn to apply 
even a few of the most elementary principles of 
the landscaping art! A very few students might 
continue the study in a more advanced school and 
make landscaping a profession, but this would be 
only a very few compared with the number who 
would appreciate the art sufficiently to cause them 
to employ an expert or use their own hands to 
beautify their surroundings. 
It would be easy to multiply illustrations. One 
might say almost the same concerning stage set- 
tings and store-window displays or house furnish- 
ings or clothing and millinery, and so on thru the 
list. But this is unnecessary. The point is that 
for purposes of appreciation as well as for pro- 
duction, training in art craftsmanship must be con- 
crete and practical. Instead of teaching pure de- 
sign in the elementary or high schools, teach de- 
sign through experience in some art, handicraft, 
industry, or profession. Pure design belongs to 
the college, not, as a rule, to the schools of lower 
grade. Instead of long, dry courses in freehand 
drawing and design give intensive, short, practical 
courses in art crafts and occupations. Suppose that
-P-A-G-E-31
  EDUCATION OF ART APPRECIATORS 31 
a given high school were to offer six of the eleven 
types of work suggested above, and that a given 
student were to take four of these: for example, 
posters, printing, landscaping and house furnish- 
ings, is it not within the realm of probability that 
if these were well taught—with some real practi- 
cal experience in each—he would have acquired 
more of value in modern life than if he had spent 
the same time in formal and abstract problems 
such as have been common in art courses in high 
schools? But superficial work must not be toler- 
ated. He must make posters of commercial value 
or near-commercial value; he must set type and 
do real artistic printing; he must make landscap- 
ing plans and have a part in carrying some of them 
through to reality; he must design and make some 
real furniture and study its relation to other items 
of home equipment. The designing must be 
guided by experience in execution of the designs, 
as well as the execution be guided by the work- 
ing drawings. 
When one comes to the training of the worker 
in art craftsmanship a new factor enters the prob- 
lem. All students with normal capabilities can be 
successful to a greater or less degree in becoming 
appreciators of works of art, but a far less num- 
ber can meet the standard of the successful pro- 
ducer of art goods and wares, of fine paintings and 
great pieces of sculpture. To be both artistically 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  
  82 ART TRAINING FOR LIFE 
and economically successful as an art producer is 
not possible with any large proportion of the stu- 
dents of a given community. And so the question 
of talent or aptitude or capacity is of first con- 
sideration in the training of art producers. If a 
given course is definitely planned for producers 
then there ought to be some way of reserving that 
course for students who have the particular quali- 
fications. It is a waste of the time of students and 
of the money set apart for art education to allow 
every student who has an impulse toward art to 
enter upon a vocational course in art without 
demonstrating in a preliminary “finding” course, 
which should be planned fundamentally as a 
course for appreciators, that he has ability which, 
if properly developed, will enable him to be suc- 
cessful as an art worker. Just what constitutes 
success may be difficult to determine, and just how 
to select students wisely may be a hard problem 
to solve, yet the principle involved is a correct one. 
In selecting students it is important that some 
of the tests consist of real experience in the arts 
being considered. This is an added reason for 
having the preliminary course, which is planned for 
appreciators, consist of real experiences and not 
merely formal exercises without application or use. 
A second element in the training of workers 
needs emphasis. Any sound course of preparation 
for workers in the art crafts and industries in-
-P-A-G-E-33
EDUCATION OF ART APPRECIATORS 33 
volves training in processes and the use of ma- 
terials—actual experience with tools and machines 
in producing—as well as training in drawing and 
design. This does not mean that the worker must 
necessarily have equal skill in all phases of the art 
or craft, but it does mean that he must have had 
fundamental experience in all. To design furni- 
ture successfully a man must know the processes of 
cabinet making, including wood-turning, wood- 
carving, upholstery and wood finishing. To be a 
wood-turner or a wood-carver of the type that is 
desired, he must know drawing and somewhat of 
design. No school of art craftsmanship should 
adopt the extreme sub-division of labor that has 
become common in many factories. Indeed, it is 
believed that many factories would not carry the 
sub-division so far were they able to secure ade- 
quately trained workers, and that they would have 
less difficulty in maintaining a high standard of 
product at less cost if they had more adequately 
educated workers. When the small shop or the 
individual craftsman is taken as the unit of pro- 
duction there is no question but that each crafts- 
man must know the whole of his craft. Nothing 
short of this individual unit is the safe standard 
for schools to set in many of the art crafts, and in 
others, relatively few main sub-divisions of the 
craft should be recognized. Specialization should 
be allowed but never at the expense of foundation 
iy 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  
  34 ART TRAINING FOR LIFE 
experiences in the whole craft. In this way only 
can America build up a worthy standard of art 
craftsmanship and an adequate supply of trained 
workers. 
It may, therefore, be said that there is one 
fundamental factor in training for both apprecia- 
tion and production, and that is real experience. 
We ought not to have to be told by a psychologist 
that appreciation is based upon experience, yet in 
many, if not most, school courses we proceed as 
though we never heard of such a fact; we rush 
students through superficial courses which tell 
about art and craftsmanship, but gives no contact 
with the real thing itself. At best such courses 
give only intellectual data which cannot function 
effectively until illuminated with emotional and 
added intellectual material that comes only with 
fundamental experience in the art itself. Yet, if 
we will but make a few observations we are forced 
to recognize that real appreciation is a matter of 
slow growth and comes only as the result of ex- 
perience. Reading what somebody says of what 
somebody else did in art means very little in the 
art development of the reader if he, himself, has 
not in some vital way come into contact with the 
essential elements of that particular form of art. 
One can recall his own experience and realize the 
truth of the principle involved. He can recall that 
he never had any adequate appreciation of the
-P-A-G-E-35
  EDUCATION OF ART APPRECIATORS 35 
beauty of wrought iron work until with hammer 
and forge and anvil he learned to bend and shape 
heated iron. He never caught the subtle beauties 
of a fine example of water-color painting until he 
had tried his hand with brush and pigments. He 
never exercised proper discrimination in selecting 
carved or turned pieces of furniture until he 
learned some of the niceties of the arts of turning 
and carving. 
eee ial He bese otsepe tain = 
though the schools have not usually recognized this 
fact. Experience is also essential to-skitt- This 
fact is, however, quite generally recognized. The 
schools concede the fact that experience is necessary 
to produce effective workers. Perhaps they have 
conceded too much in this direction, and have mis- 
applied some of the psychology of habit formation, 
but that is another story. 
To recognize the importance of practical experi- 
ence with tools, process, materials, pigments, etc., 
in the art training of both the appreciator and the 
worker ought to lead to more effectiveness in 
schools and a higher art standard for the nation.

  Chapter IV. More Art in Industry—America’s 
Opportunity 
SN THE first three chapters of this book 
Ny a plea has been made for instruction in 
art because it enriches life. The pur- 
pose of this and the succeeding chapter 
is to emphasizé the value of art and art 
education from the economic standpoint, and to 
urge that adequate measures be taken to give such 
instruction as will enable the United States to take 
a place among the art-producing nations of the 
world proportionate to its population, its wealth 
and its national ideals. 
The World’s Fair of 1851 is taken as the focal 
center in considering the development of art in in- 
dustry, because from it came an impulse toward 
art training that affected all the great nations of 
the world. 
This exposition was planned by the men of 
England in order to give British manufacturers an 
opportunity to demonstrate to the world the supe- 
riority of British-made articlese They invited 
competition with the rest of the world, apparently 
39
-P-A-G-E-40
  
40 ART TRAINING FOR INDUSTRY 
in full confidence of their position of leadership. 
Instead of showing British superiority, however, 
the Fair revealed the fact that the manufacturing 
products of England were far below those of 
France wherever skill and taste in production were 
involved. 
The year after the Fair, Cardinal Wiseman 
made an address in Manchester in which he said: 
“The exhibition showed that, though we made 
magnificent things in silver work, and gorgeous 
objects in metallic productions, beautiful and 
splendid, yet, when you came to look at them with 
the artists’ eye, you could not help observing the 
immense difference between our English produc- 
tions and those of France.” He further pointed 
out that the best products of the English gold- 
smiths were by imported workmen; “and it was 
thus we did produce some objects that stood in 
competition, not with those of the workman’s 
rivals, but with those of his own countrymen.” 
So it was that England found herself behind 
most of the nations of the world in art products. 
Having been convinced of her inferiority, England 
immediately took steps to provide a remedy. The 
very next year Queen Victoria said in addressing 
Parliament: ‘The advancement of the fine arts 
and of practical science will be readily recognized 
by you as worthy of the attention of a great and 
enlightened nation,” and immediately there was
-P-A-G-E-41
MORE ART IN INDUSTRY 41 
established the Albert and Victoria Museum at 
South Kensington, a great national repository for 
works of industrial art, combined with a scheme 
for art education that comprehended all the indus- 
trial centers of England. 
While the establishment of the museum at South 
Kensington was the beginning of a great movement 
in art education, it was also the culmination of a 
long period of agitation in favor of art education 
as a national asset and a commercial and industrial 
necessity. Thirteen years before the World’s Fair, 
on January 11, 1838, there was held in Exeter 
Hall, London, the inaugural meeting of an organi- 
zation known as the ‘‘Society for Promoting De- 
sign and Diffusing a Knowledge and Love of the 
Arts Among the People.” This organization grew 
out of the investigations of a committee of five 
members of the House of Commons appointed “‘to 
enquire into the best means of extending among 
the people, especially the manufacturing classes, a 
knowledge of and a taste for art.” In the ad- 
dress of the deputy chairman on that occasion he 
expressed his regret that “drawing and the culti- 
vation of the fine arts had been so much neglected” 
in his country, “seeing the advantages they have 
diffused in foreign parts, where drawing is as cheap 
as writing.”’* 
*Pamphlet entitled “Society for Promoting Practical 
Design.” 
   
-P-A-G-E-42
  42 ART TRAINING FOR INDUSTRY 
The chairman of the meeting, who was also the 
chairman of the House of Commons Committee, 
said: 
“T am sorry to say that the result of that en- 
quiry was not favorable to us as a nation studious 
of art. The energy of our national character, the 
ingenuity and the wealth of our capitalists, the un- 
conquerable laboriousness of our people, have 
spread our manufacturing productions into the 
furthest regions of the world. But, in those arti- 
cles of workmanship whereof the arts form an 
essential element, the enquiries of the committee 
proved that our success was far inferior to that 
of many other nations.” 
The speaker found the reason for this condi- 
tion (1) in the lack of museums where objects of 
art could be seen by the public, (2) in a shortage 
of public libraries, and (3) in the fact that no 
schools of design were available. He called at- 
tention to the fact that “The wisdom of Louis 
XIV, or rather the wisdom of his wiser ministers, 
called forth those living fountains of the arts to 
refresh the commerce of France . . . . Eighty 
schools of design, he said, diffuse refinement and 
taste among the manufacturers of France... . 
In the small kingdom of Bavaria they have no 
less than thirty-three and will soon have many 
more .... In Belgium and Holland schools are
-P-A-G-E-43
  MORE ART IN INDUSTRY 43 
founded for instruction in art in all the large towns, 
which are open freely to all.” 
A little later in his address the speaker said: 
“Shall we always see the fancy patterns of for- 
eign artists exhibited in our shops? Ornamental 
work, and iron ornaments from Germany, copies 
and casts of the antique from Italy, silks, bronzes 
and ormolu from France? Shall we remain 
drudging mechanics, or shall we become inventive 
artisans?” 
These few sentences reveal some facts concern- 
ing industrial art education in Europe and the 
thoughts of a few progressive Englishmen as early 
as 1838, yet it took the World’s Fair in 1851 to 
bring about national action concerning this matter 
in England. This action, however, was immedi- 
ately followed by Germany. The South Kensing- 
ton Museum was established in 1852. In 1855 
the Royal School of Art Industry was founded in 
Munich. During the next few years Germany and 
Austria opened museums as follows: Vienna in 
1864, Berlin in 1866, Nuremberg in 1868, Wei- 
mar in 1869, Dresden in 1869, Leipsic and Ham- 
burg in 1874, and smaller museums at Stuttgart, 
Cologne, Mayence, Darmstadt, Karlsruhe, Salz- 
burg, Augsburg and other cities. 
Up to 1872, according to the British official re- 
port, England had established 122 schools where 
industrial art was taught. In addition to the in-
-P-A-G-E-44
  44 ART TRAINING FOR INDUSTRY 
struction in these schools 194,000 children were 
receiving instruction in drawing in the “‘schools for 
the poor.” Up to that time, also, there had been 
established one well-appointed art school of 190 
students for every 210,000 of the population. 
Thus, instruction in art as applied to industry was 
rapidly provided and diffused among the indus- 
trial classes of Great Britain, and the results soon 
became evident. 
“At the Paris Exposition in 1867 England stood 
in the first rank of artistic nations, and even sur- 
passed some of those who previously had carried 
off the highest honors.t 
“This great advance made by the English from 
1851 to 1867 alarmed the French. They saw that 
they could no longer rely on that prestige which 
had always placed them at the head; and they in 
turn began to reconstruct, improve and increase 
their art schools. The commission appointed by 
the Emperor Napoleon III, after due consider- 
ation, made an elaborate report, and the govern- 
ment acted upon its recommendations.” 
But France was not the only nation to act. Im- 
mediately after the Franco-Prussian War the 
Prussian minister of commerce and industry issued 
a circular, calling upon the government and the 
people to follow the example of France. This 
movement gave Germany the art schools that have

MORE ART IN INDUSTRY 45 
forced her art manufacturers into the markets of 
the world in competition with those of the best of 
the other nations. ; 
Thus it was that commercial competition was 
the largest factor in forcing forward a develop- 
ment in industrial art instruction in Europe during 
the second half of the nineteenth century. During 
all this period, the United States of America was 
for the most part content to furnish the raw ma- 
terials of industry and to invent machines to de- 
crease the cost of mechanical production. During 
the last thirty years, however, the United States 
has taken an important first step by educating the 
taste and giving some skill to many of its children 
through art instruction and manual training in pub- 
lic schools. 
Now that the great war has upset economic con- 
ditions, there has come America’s great oppor- 
tunity to follow the example of England after 
1851, of France after 1867, and of Germany after 
1872, and to spend a few of her millions of dol- 
lars in a nation-wide development of art as applied 
to industry. Now is the psychological moment for 
America to step into the arena of artistic produc- 
tion, as she hag into the battlefields of Europe. 
But this can not be done without preparation. Just 
as she spent billions to compensate for unprepared- 
ness for war, so she must now spend a few mil- 
lions, at least, to educate art workers for the in-  
-P-A-G-E-46
  
46 ART TRAINING FOR INDUSTRY 
dustries of peace. John Galsworthy has recently 
told us that the United States has the most favor- 
able conditions of all the great nations for the de- 
velopment of art: We have the money; we have 
the market; and we have the inherited talent of 
all the races of Europe. We have many rapidly 
developing museums of art; we have at least a few 
men and women of genius, and a much larger 
number of experts trained in the best schools of 
Europe; and we have the organizing and ad- 
ministrative ability required to develop a national 
system of industrial art education. Why not act 
at once? 
One very important reason why we have not 
acted in the past is that we have not, as a nation, 
projected our minds in that direction; we have 
not caught the vision of a comprehensive national 
scheme of industrial art education. Even up to 
the present time we have not mapped out the field 
or formulated any practical plan of procedure. 
We have recently set in operation a national 
scheme of vocational education under the direct 
supervision of the Federal Board for Vocational 
Education, covering agricultural education, indus- 
trial education and education in home economics. 
Now we should add to this a comprehensive, prac- 
tical scheme of education in industrial art. This 
must be done without long delay if America is to

compete favorably with European nations, even in 
our own American markets, for the finer grades 
of manufactured articles.

  HE training that is going to meet the 
future needs of the art industries of 
this country must give instruction from 
the standpoint of the factory,” said 
Harrington as he slowly swung him- 
self around and dropped into a big lounging chair 
at the club. ‘“The present art schools may be all 
right to produce painters, but they don’t meet the 
needs in the industries. Even in the matter of 
drawing we furniture manufacturers prefer a good 
technical high school graduate to a man who has 
taken a course of training in an art school. In 
either case we have to teach him our business from 
the bottom up, and the high school graduate is 
more adaptable than the man from the art schooal.”? 
“T recognize the truth of your state 9” ed M g 
I, “but I would like to know just Wr sa mean 7, 
by giving instruction from the sta of thea 
factory. How would you go about/it ? i” er 
“T can’t tell you that,” said Hatrington. “So, 
haven’t thought it out; but I do know that there of Qo ie

  ge?
-P-A-G-E-50
  50 ART TRAINING FOR INDUSTRY 
is a high wall between the art schools and most 
of the art industries, and that very few men ever 
climb over. What ought to be done is to remove 
the wall so that it will be easy to go from the 
school to the factory and from the factory to the 
school.” 
“But just where is the trouble,” I urged; “is 
it in the character and method of present art 
school instruction, or is it because the art courses 
stop before they reach out in the dissenan of the 
industries ?”” 
“T think both,” was the reply. “It surely stops 
before it reaches us.” 
This conversation gave me the opportunity I 
had been looking for. For some time I had been 
wanting to get Harrington in a corner where he 
would listen to me. I had been wanting to outline 
to him what I have believed to be the solution of 
the problem that I knew had been bothering him. 
So I began: 
“As you said the other day, there is no place 
where a workman of considerable experience and 
ility can go and get instruction in the higher 
% W art igue of his trade. Take, for example, 
young an whom you mentioned. I don’t 
«know of a school for furniture design in this coun- 
try where h@%ould get just what he needs. The 
only school @ that type I ever saw was the Tisch- 
lerschule ip®Berlin. Before the war men went
-P-A-G-E-51
  NATIONAL SCHOOL OF INDUSTRIAL ART 51 
there from Sweden, Norway, Russia, and other 
countries as well as from all parts of Germany to 
learn the art of interior decoration and furniture 
design and construction. A German interior dec- 
orator or a cabinet maker, even with ten years or 
more of successful experience, found it profitable 
to spend a term or two at this school because then 
he was able to do a higher type of work which 
commanded larger pay. Besides, he had the sat- 
isfaction of being a leader in his craft. Every such 
leader turned out of the school tended to raise the 
standard of the trade. Something of this sort we 
must have in the United States, and the sooner it 
comes the better. And such a school should cover 
not one industry merely but several groups of in- 
dustries in which design in form and color is an 
important factor. It should be to all the art in- 
dustries what post-graduate courses in the univer- 
sities are to the professions. It would be a place 
of research and of advanced instruction in special 
branches of art and art manufacture. It would 
give artists a higher type of special training than 
can be obtained at the present time. 
“To such a school a manufacturer might profit- 
ably send his designer or his foreman in the off 
season to get the latest and soundest ideas, and to 
come in contact with leaders in his craft. To such 
a school the young worker would go in order to 
prepare for a job higher up,
-P-A-G-E-52
  52 ART TRAINING FOR INDUSTRY 
“Moreover, such a school is much needed to ele- 
vate the standard of teaching in technical high 
schools, industrial schools and vocational schools. 
If such a school were available it would attract am- 
bitious teachers from all parts of the country who 
wish to devote a few months or a year or even 
more to intensive work in one special field of art 
industry. As a training center for teachers of the 
higher branches of the manual arts such a school 
would supply a present and rapidly growing need. 
There are now several places for these teachers to 
get advanced instruction in pedagogy, but it is im- 
possible to obtain in any school in this country the 
higher industrial art instruction that is needed.” 
“Very good so far,” said Harrington, “but you 
haven’t shown me how you would make any vital 
connection with the industries or what industries 
your plan would cover.” 
“T am just coming to that,” said I. ‘Any school 
that will fully meet the needs I have outlined must 
require its students to build upon a knowledge of 
technical processes. The student must know con- 
struction; he must be a practical workman; the 
art must be developed with and through a practi- 
cal knowledge of technique. Therefore the school 
should consist fundamentally of a group of fac- 
tories. There should be a separate factory for 
each of the main divisions of art industry; for ex- 
ample, a factory for doing work in furniture mak-
-P-A-G-E-53
  NATIONAL SCHOOL OF INDUSTRIAL ART 53 
ing and interior decorating, a factory for textile 
work, a factory for ceramics, a factory for metal- 
working, a factory for printing and book making. 
Each should be a real factory turning out a limited 
product by the best known methods, using the most 
up-to-date machinery where machinery is needed, 
and the best hand-skill methods where machinery 
is not available. The things manufactured should 
be of superior quality: no inferior thing should 
be allowed to bear the stamp of the school. The 
volume of output would be small, because the pri- 
mary purpose of the school would be instruction, 
not manufacture. 
“As the instruction should include a thorough 
study of the best design and technique of the past 
as well as of the present in the leading countries 
of the world, the center of the group of factories 
should be a working museum and library well sup- 
plied with works on industrial art that are typical 
and educative, and plenty of space for study and 
drawing in the museum building. Each factory, 
too, should have space for classrooms and draft- 
ing rooms. It should be possible to make a study 
of the technical methods as well as the finished re- 
sults of the master workmen of both the past and 
the present. This was done in the Berlin school 
to which I referred, though not in the way I have 
suggested. As I was being conducted through the 
building by the director of the school, I noticed a 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
    
54 ART TRAINING FOR INDUSTRY 
beautiful cabinet in the corridor and remarked 
that it looked like one I had seen a few days be- 
fore in the National Museum in Munich. ‘It is 
an exact duplicate,’ replied the director. 
“Then he told me how he sent their professor 
of cabinet making to Munich with sketch-book and 
camera and palette; how he spent all the time 
necessary to procure accurate data of form, color, 
design, matching of wood, and construction; how 
he returned to Berlin, and with his students made 
working drawings of the cabinet; and then con- 
structed it in the shops by the same methods used 
by the medieval craftsmen who constructed the 
original cabinet in Munich. He showed me other 
pieces of furniture reproduced in the same way, 
and then he showed me pieces made by the use of 
the most modern machinery. Both the ancient and 
the modern methods were studied in order to de- 
velop knowledge and power to carry forward the 
craft to a higher standard of excellence. In fact, 
the best periods of German craftsmanship in fur- 
nishings were studied, both to gain power to re- 
produce the old styles for those who wanted them, 
and to evolve new designs to meet new ideals and 
new conditions of manufacture. 
“We in America need this type of art-craft in- 
struction to parallel the scientific instruction that 
has developed our machinery and our factory 
system. We should not copy the German system
-P-A-G-E-55
  NATIONAL SCHOOL OF INDUSTRIAL ART 55 
of industrial art training as a whole, for we can 
develop a far better one. There are elements of 
weakness in the German schools that we can avoid. 
We need to develop a system that is thoroughly 
American.” 
As I was proceeding with my story I became 
aware of the fact that at last I had caught Har- 
rington’s full attention. He had even neglected 
his cigar which he had lighted. 
‘Who would be the teachers in such a school ?” 
he asked. 
“Educated designers and craftsmen with vis- 
ion,” was my reply; ‘‘and these would be supple- 
mented by men from the best factories who could 
be loaned by the manufacturers for short periods 
of time. For example, dull-season conditions 
should be taken advantage of. If the school were 
kept up to the highest standard this temporary 
loaning of experts would benefit the manufacturers 
as well as the school, because they would carry 
back ideas from the school as well as bring ideas 
to it. But throughout the year there should be 
on the instruction staff men of the highest stand- 
ing, and the school should pay salaries to procure 
such men, just as now some of the great universities 
pay comparatively large salaries to attract and 
hold leading men in science and letters. Is there 
any reason why less should be done for the arts? 
If a man is worth $10,000 a year as a designer
-P-A-G-E-56
  56 ART TRAINING FOR INDUSTRY 
of textiles or furniture, he ought to be worth fully 
as much in a school where he would have a chance 
to train scores of men to become expert designers. 
If a foreman is worth $5,000 a year in a factory, 
he ought to be worth fully that amount in a school- 
factory where he would have a chance to raise the 
quality of the products in dozens of factories 
where his students would be employed. It would 
be essential that such a school have its choice of 
all the best industrial art talent of the nation for 
a part of the time, and some of the best talent all 
the time.” 
“But,” said Harrington, “‘if the school were to 
do that, then it would lead the industries in mat- 
ters of design and methods of manufacture, and 
that never was known to happen in America.” 
“Well,” said I, ‘whether it ever has happened 
or not, it ought to happen. Why shouldn’t it? Just 
now we are admiring French genius and skill, and 
I am reminded of a visit, several years ago, to 
the Ecole Nationale d’ Arts et Metiers at Chalons- 
sur-Marne. Here Professor Alfred Bonis, me- 
chanical engineer and superintendent of the large 
workshops of the school, showed me six engine 
lathes designed and constructed in the school which 
he told me were more advanced in mechanical 
design than any that could be purchased from a 
factory in France, and I believe they were more 
advanced than could be purchased in the United
-P-A-G-E-57
NATIONAL SCHOOL OF INDUSTRIAL ART 57 
States at that time. This school was actually lead- 
ing the industries in at least this special branch of 
machine tool design. Isolated cases of this same 
kind of leadership could be found in American 
schools, but they are not common enough. The 
United States needs centers of this type of school 
activity, and surely one of these centers ought to 
be for the art industries.” 
“Did you ever think what it would cost to run 
such a school ?”’ Harrington interposed, ‘‘and what 
proportion of the cost could be expected to come 
from the output of the factories?” 
Here I admitted that I had not yet prepared 
a budget, but I had reached certain general con- 
clusions. 
“Tn the first place the primary purpose of the 
school would be education, not money-making, but 
an important secondary purpose would be to turn 
out a few art products of high standard to sell on 
order or in the open market. Nothing should be 
sold that would not be a credit to the school from 
the standpoint of design as well as workmanship. 
No factory.run for the primary purpose of instruc- 
tion should be expected to pay the salaries of 
teachers out of receipts for products manu- 
factured. Such perpetual-motion schemes of edu- 
cation have been tried and always failed, either 
educationally or financially or both. On the other 
hand, several instances can be cited where a school
-P-A-G-E-58

factory has more than paid for the cost of stock 
and supplies consumed in giving high-grade in- 
struction. It should be noted that in this respect 
the school-factory of the type under consideration 
has a very distinct financial advantage over most 
scientific laboratories, although these are cheer- 
fully maintained at a great expense because of the 
large returns in scientific knowledge. 
“Among successful factories maintained in 
schools as a means of effective instruction, one of 
the oldest is the Washburn Shops at the Worcester 
Polytechnic Institute where machine tools are 
manufactured. These shops have for many years 
done a business of about $125,000 a year. An 
example of a successful art industry in a school is 
the Newcomb Pottery’at Sophie Newcomb Col- 
lege, New Orleans. This pottery has sold about 
$10,000 worth a year, and, this has given rise to 
production in jewelry, bookbinding, embroidery 
and other minor arts, amounting to several thou- 
sand dollars more. Professor Ellsworth Wood- 
ward, director of the College, has said that the 
enterprise has passed through the experimental 
stage successfully and established a reputation 
throughout the country. He believes the scheme 
is capable of much further development. With 
the right business, technical and educational ideals 
behind it, the school-factory has proved a success. 
Without such ideals it may readily fail.”

Here I paused to wait for Harrington’s further 
reaction. It came: 
“Do you think such a school ought to be sup- 
ported by the Government or by private funds?” 
“T am not sure, perhaps by both,” was my re- 
ply, ‘but I think it ought to be national in its 
scope. The Government might maintain it or the 
manufacturers engaged in the art industries might 
maintain the group of factories and the Govern- 
ment maintain the museum and library, or the 
whole might be established and endowed by some 
man of wealth with a desire to do a great service 
to the nation. For many reasons this would be 
an ideal way to have it established. The essential 
fact, however, in any case, is that business men, 
skilled art-craftsmen, and educators—all three, 
should be represented in its management so that 
it would be continuously maintained on a practical 
basis, and entirely apart from party politics.” 
“T agree with that, too,” said Harrington as he 
rose from his seat and moved toward the door. 
“T believe such a school would solve my problems, 
and I believe its establishment at once would be 
only reasonable preparedness to meet the new com- 
petition in the art industries. We must eliminate 
the humiliating competition which has enabled Ger- 
many to buy our raw materials, fabricate them, 
and then send them back to us in art products. She 
has been able to do this just because we have had

but few trained industrial art workers, while she 
has had many. Most of ours have come from 
Europe. She has trained her workers in her 
schools. There is no good reason why America 
should not have even better schools of industrial 
art than Germany. We can if we will. We must. 
‘Made in America’ must be a guarantee of good 
art as well as good raw materials.” 
“This may appear to be a large program com- 
pared with what we now have in the United States, 
but it is not overlarge in comparison with what 
some European nations have done, and if it were 
once accomplished and the results were to become 
evident, the wonder would be that it had not been 
done before. The world war has taught us that 
we can do things on a large scale if we will, and 
we must if we are to maintain our place indus- 
trially among the nations. Fortunately, too, the 
war seems to have brought to us a new appreci- 
ation of the value of education—not only the gen- 
eral education of our elementary schools, our high 
schools and colleges, but also of the special educa- 
tion that fits a man or woman for adequate self- 
support, and provides the nation with experts on 
whom it can call in time of need. We have come 
to*see as never before that a man educated for 
productive industry is a national asset and that 
the number of such men must be increased. While 
we are going forward in the training of men to
-P-A-G-E-61

maintain the mechanical side of industry, let us 
not forget to train men for the artistic side also. 
More and more it is becoming clear that the 
appearance of a product of manufacture is a large 
factor in its sale. Merchants realize that it is very 
often the attractive container that sells the goods. 
Little by little our schools are educating in taste, 
and each generation of consumers demands more 
artistic goods to purchase. Just now is America’s 
opportunity.”

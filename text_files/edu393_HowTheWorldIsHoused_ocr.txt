Foop, clothing, and shelter are man’s three great neces- 
sities. They are common to all races and tribes, to all 
localities, and to all times. The desire for them has 
formed the basis of civilization, and how far that desire 
has been satisfied is the chief criterion of the civilization 
which each people possesses. 
For these reasons it is of great importance that we 
should know as much as possible about food, clothing, 
and shelter as they relate to ourselves and other nations. 
They are among the fundamental elements of all geo- 
graphical study and are necessary to a knowledge of the 
earth as the home of man. 
The acquisition of this knowledge is the object of the 
travels which the children accompanied by the author are 
supposed to take in the Carpenter Readers of Industry 
and Commerce. In the first book of the series, entitled 
“How the World is Fed,” their travels are devoted to 
learning about the sources of our foods and how they are 
turned into the forms in which they appear on our tables. 
In the second book, ‘“ How the World is Clothed,”’ the chil- 
dren go over the globe to investigate what the people wear 
and how it is made. The third volume is comprised of 
the pages which follow, and is devoted to “How the World 
is Housed.” In this book the children travel over the 
globe to learn for themselves where the materials in their

homes come from and how they are prepared for use. 
They also study the homes of other countries, visiting their 
little world brothers and sisters and seeing how they 
live. 
In each of these three books the travels are made 
along geographical lines, and the children, while studying 
the industries and home life of the various nations, learn 
to know the principal trade routes and other branches of 
the world of commerce. Their imaginary travels give them 
a live knowledge of many geographical features, thereby 
vivifying the study of their geographical textbooks. 
In “ How the World is Housed,” the children are first 
taught the evolution of the house, beginning with the 
homes of the cave men and the tree shelters of the 
aborigines and ending with the enormous buildings of 
our modern civilization. They travel among the tent 
dwellers of the great desert countries, visit some of the 
people who still live in huts, and also those who have 
homes of grass, cane, and leaves. They peep into the odd 
houses of Asia and Africa, and see something of those of 
Europe and the other continents. They have a glance at 
some of the buildings of the past, and especially those of 
colonial times, and then take up the study of our homes 
of the present. 
During their world-wide travels the children investigate 
the sources and manufacture of building materials. They 
go with the lumbermen into the forests and watch them 
chopping the trees and rafting the logs to the mills. 
They follow the logs as they pass through the band 
saws, planers, and other machines, coming forth in the 
shapes used in modern house building. At the same time

PREFACE Fi 
the extent of our lumber regions is shown, and also the 
important place which they have in our national wealth. 
In other journeys the little travelers go down into the 
quarries from whence our marbles, granites, slates, and other 
building stones come; and learn how artificial stones, such 
as concrete, cement, and plaster, are made. They also 
visit the brickyards, and study the great part that clay has 
in our homes. 
The next subject taken up is iron and steel as regards 
modern house building. To learn about this the children 
enter the mines, and follow the ore through the furnaces 
and rolling mills until it at last appears in the structural 
steel shapes of our great office buildings. They also see 
the metal turned into nails, screws, locks, and hinges. 
They then investigate tin and zinc as far as they are 
related to building, and afterwards learn about lead, 
copper, and brass. Other travels are devoted to glass, 
others to wood pulp and paper, and still others to paints, 
oils, and varnishes. 
An important part of the book is that which treats of 
the heating, lighting, and water supply; and others are 
those showing the wonders of. our factories, thereby giv- 
ing the children some idea of the advantages of the 
civilization in which they live. 
In writing this volume every attempt has been made 
to fill it with human interest and child interest without 
descending to the level of petty curiosity. It is a live 
book for the live, wide-awake American boys and girls of 
the present day, who are here traveling over the globe to 
examine things of real interest to them; and to study their 
world brothers and sisters as such, and as they are related

to and connected with them in the work of the world. 
It is believed that these many journeys will do much to 
give the children an idea of the earth as a whole, and 
of the relations which it has to the places upon it in 
which they live.

HOW. THE WORLD IS HOUSED 
1. INTRODUCTION 
HIS book is to be the record of the doings of a party 
of children who are to travel with the author over 
this big round earth. Each one who reads it is to imagine 
himself one of the party, and we are to go together over 
the oceans and across the mountains and plains looking 
at and learning about the world for ourselves. There 
will be so much to see that we must keep our eyes wide 
open. We shall carry cameras with us to photograph the 
most interesting sights, and our pencils and notebooks 
must be always at hand to write down the things we wish 
to remember and tell to our people at home. 
We shall not travel without an object. The world is so 
large and it has so much to show us that we might spend 
our whole lives in journeying over it and not see it all. 
So it is best to take up one class of things at a time, and 
devote our journeys to that. In other books of this series 
we have already gone over the globe to learn how the 
world is fed, and how it is clothed. In our present travels 
we shall try to find out how it is housed. We shall peep 
into the dwellings of our little brothers and sisters of other 
races in different parts of the earth and see how they 
live. We want to know how their houses are made and 
9
-P-A-G-E-10
10 INTRODUCTION 
furnished. We would also learn as to our own homes and 
how they are constructed, and we shall go to the places 
from where the building materials come, and see how they 
are prepared for our shelter and comfort. 
All this will require many long journeys. We shall 
travel over the various grand divisions, and explore many 
parts of them. We shall go into the mighty forests to 
see where the wood comes from; to the quarries to watch 
men getting out the granite, marble, and other building 
stones; and perhaps descend below ground to learn about 
the iron, copper, tin, and other metals used in putting them 
together. We shall visit factories and foundries of many 
kinds, and find that thousands of people all over the 
world are always at work in the industry of making our 
houses. We shall see the great part that commerce has 
to do with preparing the materials and bringing them to 
the places where they are required for building, as well 
as in erecting the structures. Our travels will therefore 
be along the two great lines of industry and commerce, 
which have so much to do with our own employment and 
. comfort. 
Before we’ start out, however, let us have a little talk 
about those people who lived long ago before houses, as 
we know them, existed. No one can tell just what was the 
first language spoken or just where was the first place on 
earth that man lived; and in the same way it is hard to say 
what the first house was like. We believe that all mankind 
were originally savages. They either went naked or 
dressed in skins or leaves, and in all probability their 
earliest shelters were the wide-spreading trees of the for- 
ests in which they lived. They crowded around the trunks

INTRODUCTION Il 
of the trees to keep out of the sun and the rain, and climbed 
into the branches to be safe from the wild animals that 
might attack them. In the winter they sought out caves 
in the rocks and holes in the earth on account of the cold, 
often driving out the savage beasts who had their homes 
there. 
After a short time man learned to-meke shelters of 
branches covered with leaves or grass, and then to twist 
  Palm-leaf huts. 
the branches together and chink them with mud into huts. 
He roofed these rude shelters with grass or the skins of 
the wild animals he was able to trap, and finally learned 
how to sew the skins into tents. 
Indeed, there are many people now living in the more 
savage parts of the world who have shelters as rude as 
those of our own ancestors of long ago days. For instance, 
in the islands about the Strait of Magellan at the south- 
ern end of South America, I have seen natives who go 
almost naked. They have no villages nor fixed habita-

12 INTRODUCTION 
tions and move about fishing and hunting, making rude 
shelters wherever they stop. They choose a bushy spot, 
and, bending the branches together, tie them at the top. 
They then break off other branches and lean them against 
this framework, making a little tent about three feet high 
into which they crawl to sleep at night. Their food is fish 
and mussels and such small animals as they can trap and 
kill with their bows and arrows. They have no stoves and 
cook on fires in the open air. They are wild savages, 
and live but little better than beasts. 
It is much the same with the tribes of black people who 
inhabit the wilder parts of Australia. They make their 
shelters by tearing off pieces of bark from the fallen trees 
and leaning them against one another. The pygmies of 
the great forests of the Kongo in the heart of Central 
Africa have no better homes. They are black dwarfs, so 
small that the full-grown men and women are no taller 
than American boys and girls of twelve and thirteen. 
They wear almost no clothing, and but few of them have 
permanent homes. Most of these little people travel 
about from place to place, sleeping upon the ground or in 
the branches of trees. Some of them dwell in caves, and 
others in rude huts of bark which they erect where they 
stop. A few of the tribes have villages or collections of 
such shelters. 
The ordinary pygmy house is so low that we could hardly 
stand upright within it, and the entrances are such that 
the little owners themselves have to crawl in. It is usually 
of an oblong shape with two doors, one in front and one 
behind, so that the pygmies may run out at the back if 
attacked at the front. The houses are formed of branches

stuck into the ground, so that they lean towards one an- 
other. They are tied at the top, and the sides and top 
are rudely thatched with leaves and grass. They have no

furniture. The pygmies sleep upon the ground or on 
beds of leaves. They live upon roots, and by trapping 
and hunting, their weapons being bows and ‘poisoned 
arrows. 
Very similar to these people are our own little brown 
cousins, the Negritos, or black dwarfs of the Philippine 
Islands. They wander about from place to place, putting 
up shelters to sleep under when night overtakes them. 
They sometimes dwell in caves or holes in the rocks, and 
we may suppose that their homes are much the same as 
those of our race before it began to be civilized.
-P-A-G-E-14
14 INTRODUCTION 
Caves have been found in England, France, and in other 
parts of Europe in which man once dwelt, and in them 
the tools of bone and flint which he then used. In some 
places our ancestors of the long-ago days cut homes for 
themselves out of the soft rock; and, even now, in the 
loess country of western China, there are people who 
dwell in similar homes. The soil there is many feet deep, 
and of such a nature that the streams and roads have cut 
deep ravines through it, the walls of which are almost 
perpendicular. In these walls the people have made 
rooms and fitted in doors and windows, forming dwellings 
‘ which are comfortable and not at all damp. 
  “In Tunis are tribes which have homes in the cliffs.’’
-P-A-G-E-15
  INTRODUCTION 15 
Not far from the Gulf of Gabes in Tunis, on the edge 
of the Desert of Sahara, are tribes which have similar 
homes in the cliffs. In the southwestern part of our 
country are to be found the remains of the Indian cliff 
dwellers, who lived in the crevices of the cliffs which they 
walled up with stone, and still farther south in Mexico are 
other cliff dwellers. In the northern parts of Alaska the 
Eskimos build their winter homes half underground, 
roofing them with snow, and digging passages below the 
earth through which they go in and out. In many newly 
settled countries the pioneers often use caves as dwellings 
until they can erect more comfortable homes, and there 
are now houses made of sod and clay in different parts of 
our West which are almost like caves. 
Returning again to that long-ago time when men were 
but little better than savages, we may suppose one of them 
grew tired of his cave home or brush tent and tried to 
make a permanent shelter which the rain could not enter 
nor the wind blow away. To do this he piled up stones 
into rude walls, and made a roof of some kind above them, 
thus constructing the first hut or real house. His fellows 
did likewise, and step by step man discovered how to 
make the foundations, to improve the roofs, and to form 
the doors and openings for light and air. 
The first tools were of stone, bone, horn, and wood. 
Later, as man learned how to work in metal, he made im- 
plements of copper and bronze and, after many ages, of 
iron and steel. As the tools became better the shelters 
steadily improved. The stones were cut into blocks and 
the trees chopped into logs. After a time smooth walls of 
stone or wood were constructed, and roofed with flat stones

By and by the secrets of glassmaking were learned, and 
step by step invention marched along with industry until 
the rude huts became houses and the villages grew into 
cities. Civilized man then began to make temples and

palaces and mighty structures of every description. The 
work of improvement went on in small buildings as well 
as in great, until we now have our wonderful homes made 
of materials gathered by commerce from all parts of the 
world, and, by industry, so combined that they give us all 
the comforts and conveniences of modern life. 
In our travels we shall find races and tribes who are 
now living in the many different stages through which 
man has risen in making a home for himself, and, by 
our imagination, can see how our ancestors lived when 
they were passing through these same conditions. More- 
over, by observing the ruins left by the people of those 
long-ago days, we shall learn something of the houses 
in which they dwelt.

E shall begin our journeys to-day by visiting some of 
the simpler homes of mankind. One of the first 
was the tent. It came into use during the early stages of 
civilization when man maintained himself largely by hunt- 
ing and needed a shelter which he could carry with him to 
the spots where the game was most plentiful. Later on it 
became the home of those who lived by rearing cattle 
and sheep, the animals being driven long distances to 
the best feeding grounds. This was so in the days of the 
Scriptures. In Genesis we read that Jabal “was the 
father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have 
cattle”; and that Abraham “sat in the tent door in the 
heat of the day.”

The first tent was probably of leaves or skins sewed to. 
gether, and stretched over a framework of poles, or the 
branches of trees. ~ It may have been like the wigwams of 
poles covered with skins in which our Indians were living 
at the time that America was discovered, or the skin tents 
which now form the summer homes of the Eskimos in the 
northern parts of our continent. Skin tents are the dwell- 
ings of some of the natives of Siberia who travel about 
in their reindeer sledges, and also of the Mongols of the 
Desert of Gobi and the regions beyond the Great Chinese 
Wall. The latter have circular dwellings made of a frame- 
work covered with skins. Tents of skin are common in 
parts of Thibet, where yaks are used to carry them from 
place to place. They are also the homes of certain tribes 
of Hottentots, and other wandering African peoples. 
  Australian shelters, 
The first cloth tent was probably of felt, somewhat simi- 
lar to that now used by the nomads of Persia, or by the 
Kirghiz of )western Asia. The Kirghiz have round tents

The Kirghiz have round tents on latticework frames. 
of a considerable size. They are upheld by a folding lat- 
ticework frame made of sections which can be opened and 
closed and therefore can easily be packed upon horses and 
carried to new grazing grounds. After this wooden frame- 
work is set up, a cover of thick felted cloth is spread 
over it, being stretched tight around the walls. It has a 
door at. the front, and is fastened at the bottom with 
stones or pegs. The Kirghiz rear many horses and sheep, 
and their chief food is mutton and horse flesh, which they 
sometimes eat with mare’s milk. They milk their mares 
as we milk our cows. 
When man learned the arts of spinning and weaving, he 
made tents of wool, flax, and other fibers. As time went 
on his tent coverings became thicker and stronger, until 
at last was invented the tightly constructed waterproof

canvas which forms the material of the army tent of to- 
day. It is made chiefly of the fibers of hemp or flax, 
and is one of the strongest of cloths. Such tents are used 
by soldiers all over the world. When on the march each 
man carries upon his back a small one in which to sleep 
at night; but in camp he lives in the larger tents brought 
along in the baggage wagons. There are also large and 
well-equipped tents for the hospitals and for the officers. 
In the past some of the tents used by the commanders 
were gorgeous. That of Alexander the Great was so big 
that one hundred people could sleep in it, its cloth roof 
being upheld by eight pillars plated with gold. Another 
famous Persian commander had a tent of red wool lined 
with violet satin beautifully embroidered. This was sup- 
ported by poles decorated with carvings and inlaid with 
mother-of-pearl. The floor was carpeted with costly rugs, 
and the whole interior was furnished more like the palace 
of a king than the home of a rough soldier. 
We take canvas tents when we gg out to hunt and fish. 
They are to be seen at camp meetings, and are used by 
the circus people and others who carry shows about the 
country. They form the homes of engineers and their 
men when laying out and constructing railroads, and of all 
people who require temporary shelters. 
The chief tent dwellers of the world, however, are no- 
mads who live in Africa and Asia. They inhabit the 
arid regions of both continents; the Tatars, including the 
Kirghiz and Mongols, being found in parts of northern 
and western Asia, and the Arabs, Bedouins, and others 
living in the vast sandy wastes of the Sahara in Africa. 
There are also many tent dwellers in Arabia and Persia.
-P-A-G-E-21
AMONG THE TENT DWELLERS 21 
The life of these nomadic or wandering peoples is every- 
where much the same. They are chiefly pastoral tribes 
who live by rearing horses, camels, cattle, sheep, and goats, 
moving about from place to place with their flocks to the 
best feeding grounds.

of Sahara. We have crossed the Atlantic Ocean and have 
passed through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterra- 
nean Sea. Landing at Algiers we make our way over 
the Atlas Mountains down into a region which is almost 
all bare rock and sand. There is a scanty growth of coarse 
grass here and there along the edge of the desert, and in 
the valleys or beds of its rivers and streams which are 
dry the greater part of the year. At long distances apart
-P-A-G-E-22
22 AMONG THE TENT DWELLERS 
are the oases, patches of green in the midst of sand, 
watered only by springs or underground streams. In 
some of the oases are villages and in the larger ones cities 
or towns. 
The Arab tent dwellers live out in the waste. They 
move about with their flocks and herds, feeding at each 
green spot until the grass is all eaten and then going on 
to new pastures. Owing to the sparseness of the vegeta- 
tion they cannot have fixed. habitations. It does not pay 
them to build houses at each stopping place, and they must 
have portable dwellings which they can take down and put 
up as they wish. : 
The Sahara is a wild country, and many of its inhabit- 
ants are fierce men who prey upon their fellows. There- 
fore the shepherds travel about together in order that they 
may be able to defend themselves and their stock against 
robbers. They live in little tent villages, to which as night 
falls they drive their camels, sheep, and goats. 
We are surprised at the extent of the Sahara. If that 
great desert could be lifted up like a quilt and spread over 
our country it would cover every bit of it and hide a part 
of Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, It is bigger than all 
Europe; and there are many, many thousands of shep- 
herds who graze their flocks on the thin grass which 
is found here and there. Such as have camels feed them 
upon the thorn bushes as well. 
Let us pay a visit to one of these little Bedouin villages. 
It stands near a stream, far out on the sandy plain, without 
a tree or a house or any other building in sight. The 
only living things about are the dark-skinned men, 
women, and children, and the animals belonging to them,
-P-A-G-E-23
   
  AMONG THE TENT DWELLERS 
The tents are scattered over the sand and in tk, 
is a walled inclosure ‘in which the sheep and ¢ 
driven at night. 
Now suppose we examine the tents. Did you cversee— 
such curious dwellings? They are so low that one has to 
bend down on his hands and knees to go into them. They 
are made of coarse black cloth woven in stripes, spread 
over poles, and tied down by pegs in the sand. As we 
come nearer we stoop and look in. There is but little 
furniture. There are no chairs or tables and the only 
beds are rugs or cloths spread out upon the sand. Lying 
about are a few saddles, and some bags filled with cloth- 
ing. This little home has a wall of cloth through the 
center, dividing it into two parts, of which one is intended 
for the women and children, and the other for the men 
and older boys. Others of the tents have but one room, 
where all live together. 
See the little ones playing about outside. They are 
dark-skinned, made so by the sun, which is hot in this part 
of the world. They roll about in the sand. They pile up 
stones, forming inclosures like those their fathers have 
made for the flocks, and put white and black stones inside 
them, pretending they are sheep and goats. 
Now look there away off at the right. See those boys 
who are aiding their father in watching the sheep feed- 
ing on that green patch in a hollow place near the stream. 
The boys wear long gowns of white and their heads are 
wrapped up in white cloths around which thick strands of 
brown rope are tied. The man has on a turban and his 
long white gown falls to his feet. 
But see, they are coming this way. The sun is just set-
-P-A-G-E-24
      AMONG THE TENT DWELLERS 
ting and they are driving the sheep and goats home for 
the night. They greet us ina friendly way, as they come 
up; and at their invitation we sit down and take dinner 
with them. The 
meal is spread on 
the sand just out- 
side their little tent 
home. It consists 
of a kid which was 
killed in our honor, 
and of couscous 
made of flour, herbs, 
and flesh. The flour 
is of millet, ground 
by the girls between 
two stones, moved 
one over the other, 
thus crushing the 
grain. The kid is

our host tears it

As we travel on our camels over the desert we pass 
many tent villages, and frequently see Arabs driving their 
flocks to new feeding grounds. They are always on the 
march, although they may now and then stop for a time 
near some oasis to sell their sheep or wool, and see 
something of the life of the towns. They are soon on the

way again, however; and even while near the oases they 
dwell in their tents. Many of the Arab shepherd boys 
do not know where they will be living next month, and 
some have several different homes in the course of the 
year. Such is the life of the nomadic tent dwellers, of 
whom millions are living to-day. It was the same with 
the Indian boys who, with their parents, roamed the 
United States searching for new hunting grounds at the 
time our forefathers came, and it is still so with many of 
our Eskimo cousins who, with their dogs and their rein- 
deer, move their skin tents from place to pints during the 
summer on the lookout for game. 
  Skin tents form the summer homes of the Eskimos.

HE hut is the simplest form of man’s permanent 
home. It has been used since the beginning of 
history, and is still to be found in one shape or another all 
over the globe. It is the chief house of the African, and 
about the only shelter used by the natives of the islands

of the South Seas. There are millions in China and India 
who dwell in huts, and we shall see such habitations 
scattered over the South American continent. Even in 
civilized Europe and in our own North America some of 
the poorest of the people have huts of one kind or another ;
-P-A-G-E-27
    
4 PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN HUTS 27 
and indeed, such dwellings, made of straw, stone, brick, 
and wood are to be found all over the globe. 
The character of the hut depends largely upon the 
building material at hand, as well as upon the climate 
and needs of those who are to live in it. In the cold 
lands of the far north, the Eskimos employ thick blocks 
of ice, which they build up in a dome shape. These icy 
houses have very small openings, as one of the chief 
objects of the hut is 
for warmth. Is it 
not strange to use 
ice to keep warm? 
In the hot lands 
of the Equator, huts 
are often made of 
bamboo canes 
woven together, 
and thatched with palm leaves or grasses of various kinds. 
Sometimes they are mere shelters without walls; and at 
others are loosely put together that the air may blow 
through. The aim there is to keep cool. 
Near Timbuktu, in the Desert of Sahara, far north of 
where we are now traveling, are beds of rock salt out of 
which the people take blocks to sell to the caravans, which 
carry them to the oases and countries to the southward, 
where salt is in demand. The miners make their houses 
of these blocks. There is no rain in that part of the des- 
ert, and the salt serves for both walls and roofs. 
If we should go to the plains and lowlands of the world 
we might find millions of men, women, and children living 
in rude dwellings of mud and sun-dried bricks. Many such

In the mountains and other rocky regions we shall find 
huts of stone or of earth mixed with stone; and where the 
vegetation is dense, some of grass and leaves, or perhaps 
of logs laid up like the cabins used by our forefathers. 
Indeed, the huts are so many that it will be impossible 
for us to examine them all. They are usually the homes 
of the poor, and in the wilder parts of the earth are little 
more than shelters from the weather and places for sleep- 
ing at night. There are many such dwellings on this great 
continent of Africa, where we now are, and we shall visit 
some of them first.

The huts of the oases have walls of mud with a frame- 
work of: date palm wood for their windows and doors. 
Such houses are small, seldom containing more than two 
or three rooms. The ground is the floor, and the flat roof 
is often of palm branches woven together and covered with 
mud. There is but little rain, and waterproof coverings are 
not needed. The houses are built in villages along nar- 
row streets, without sidewalks. 
In the larger oases the people have better homes; and, 
in Ghadames, a town in the heart of the desert, the houses 
are of two stories, the upper ones extending out over the 
streets, so that going through it is like traveling through

tunnels. There are stores on the ground floor, and the 
people live in the rooms overhead. The buildings’ are box- 
shaped, with flat roofs, which often form the beds of the 
family. 
Traveling on: eastward we come to the homes of the 
Egyptians in the Valley of the Nile. The majority of 
these ‘people are peasants, who dwell in huts of sun-dried 
brick. Their building materials are about the same as 
those used when the Israelites worked here for Pharaoh 
in the times of the Bible. The huts stand in villages on 
the banks of the river, or along the narrow roadways 
which run through the green fields on both sides of the 
Nile. They are often shaded by date palms. They look 
bare and dreary, and have few of the comforts of even the 
poorest of our American homes. 
These Egyptian houses are so small that we can see over 
the roofs as we sit on our camels. They are seldom more 
than fifteen feet square, and have only one or two rooms. 
The roofs are flat. On many of them are stored the 
bundles of cornstalks and brush which the people use for 
fuel. Imagine having your woodpile or coal bin on the 
roof ! 
Egyptian huts have no chimneys. The cooking is done 
on a clay stove out of doors. The windows are high up, 
and are little more than holes in the walls. There is no 
furniture to speak of, and a ledge of earth at the side of 
the room serves as the bed and chairs of the family. In 
the towns the houses are better, and in the cities some are 
as large and as fine as our own homes.

dwellings made of woven canes and elephant grass plas- 
tered over with mud; and near Lake Tchad is Kuka, a 
large city whose houses are walled with reeds covered 
with mud, and roofed with straw thatch. 
In the far southern parts of the continent live the Kafirs, 
black people who have dome-roofed dwellings of mud, and 
in other sections are other mud huts of various kinds. 
Not a few of these mud villages are in localities where 
wood is abundant, and we wonder why the natives do not 
use logs. One reason is the white ant, which is found in 
great numbers all over Africa. This little insect will eat 
anything wooden. It works in the dark, and will burrow 
inside a rafter or post and eat away at it until only a shell 
is left, when the structure of which it is a part falls to the 
ground. These ants are home builders themselves. They
-P-A-G-E-33
  
    
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN HUTS 33 
dwell in great mounds of many rooms which they con- 
struct by mixing the clay or earth with a juice or saliva 
from their mouths. This turns the clay to a cement 
which, as it dries, hardens like stone. 
In making their huts the natives often use this cement- 
like earth which the white ants have prepared. They 
either drive out the ants, or take one of the abandoned ant 
hills, and, by pounding and mixing the clay with water, 
make a mortar, which they use to cover the framework of 
their huts, forming excellent walls. They spread this stuff 
over the ground for the floors, and thus have dwellings 
which the white ants will not destroy. 
In many other parts of Africa the huts are made of 
grasses and canes of various kinds. The tribes about 
Lake Victoria have many such homes, each built after a

such as the people of Uganda, have towns made of great

about as thick as your finger. The Uganda dwellings are 
so beautifully woven that they look like basketwork. The 
roofs are of a thick thatch which shines like silver-gray 
velvet in the afternoon sun. 
As to huts of stone, they are found in the mountainous 
parts of Africa, as well as in all other stony regions, scat- 
tered over the earth’s surface. There are many in the 
Atlas Mountains, and in the Himalayas, the Alps, and the 
Caucasus. I have seen them high up in the Andes, where 
the Indians sometimes chink the holes between the stones 
with mud. The Indian homes are little better than ken-

neys, and their thatched roofs are often held down with 
stones on account of the high winds. Near them are the 
stone-walled inclosures where the llamas, alpacas, and 
sheep are kept at night. 
Going down to the lowlands on either side of the Andes, 
we find hut dwellings with walls of reeds or of canes

T seems strange to think of American citizens spending 
their lives in shelters of grass, cane, and leaves. Uncle 
Sam has many such people, although they are not on this 
continent. They are, however, under the rule of the 
United States government, and we may rightly call them 
our little brown cousins. Take our relatives of Porto 
Rico, for instance. The poorer of them dwell in huts of 
cane or palm leaves. The Samoans, who live in the mid- 
dle of the Pacific Ocean, have houses of grass. Until 
within a few years the natives of the Hawaiian Islands 
dwelt in grass shelters, and to-day there are many people 
in Guam whose homes are thatched huts. Farther off in the 
Philippines thousands of the poorer classes inhabit cane 
dwellings, the bamboo forming one of their chief building 
materials, and the broad leaves of the palm another. 
But suppose we take ship and visit some of our rela- 
tives in these far-away lands. We shall start with Samoa. 
The first hut we enter looks like a haystack upon poles. 
Its thatched roof has been turned silver-gray by the weather. 
It reaches almost to the ground, extending beyond the gay- 
colored mats which form the walls of the dwelling. The 
mats rest against round posts which uphold the roof, and 
are so hung that they can be rolled up, allowing the air

fellow citizens about themselves and their homes. They 
show us the furniture, consisting mainly of clay pots, 
bowls of coconut shell or gourds, wooden pillows, and 
mats of one kind or another. There are no stoves for 
heating, as the climate is warm, and the only fire used is 
for cooking or to 
make a smoke to 
keep out the mos- 
quitoes. There are

ments, but the 
people wash them- 
selves daily in the

in the cold streams

The dwellings here are much alike. They are of grass or 
cane, varying in size and character according to the tribes 
to which the islands belong. In one village the houses 
may be square, in another round, and in a third, perhaps, 
’ oblong like a hayrick. They are usually built upon a 
framework of palm trees, and most of them have little 
patches of taro or bananas near by. The walls may be of

thin wickerwork beautifully woven, or of reeds or grasses 
so sewn or tied together that they are three feet in thick- 
ness. The reeds are sometimes dyed before using, and 
many of the houses have walls of beautiful patterns. 
Nearly all have thatched roofs, and in some the roofs ex- 
tend almost to the ground. 
Most of the grass houses are exceedingly small, consist- 
ing of but one room. Those of the rich men and chiefs 
are large, ranging in length up to fifty feet and even more. 
Some of them have heavy ridge roofs which extend well 
out beyond their basketwork walls. 
These island homes have but little furniture, although 
some are better supplied than those of our friends in Samoa. 
In the earthen floors of the Fiji houses there are raised 
places where the guests and other honored persons sleep 
upon mats or beds of sweet-smelling grass. The pillows 
are of wood, so cut that the neck just fits into them. The 
fire holes are large and pots and pans of burnt clay, 
wooden bowls, and other rude kitchen utensils are used. 
In the large island of New Guinea, and in the Solomons 
near by, are savages whose homes are even stranger than 
those we have seen. Here are dwellings high up in the 
trees in order that the owners may be safe from their ene- 
mies, some of whom are head-hunters and supposed to be 
cannibals. The tree shelters are made of cane and palm 
leaves and are reached by ladders which are drawn up at 
night. 
When we first took possession of the Philippines our 
soldiers found tree dwellers in southeastern Mindanao. 
Their thatched huts were made of bamboo and grass, and 
they entered them by climbing notched sticks which they

  Moro hut upon bamboo poles. 
Many of the Moros of the Sulu Islands dwell in bamboo 
huts built upon poles above the water, some distance out 
from the shore. Their houses can be reached only by 
canoes or the rude wooden bridges which in some cases 
connect them wits the land. Similar houses are used by 
the Malays in the Dutch East Indies. 
The buildings we have so far seen have each been the 
home of one family. In some of these far-away regions 
are dwellings made of grass and cane, so large that they

house many persons. Borneo has tribes which have huts 
several hundred feet long and sixty feet wide, one of which 
may contain fifty families. Such a hut consists of a frame- 
work of poles covered with a thatch of grass or of the 
leaves of palm trees. A hall runs through the center of 
the building, and this is faced by little stalls in each of 
which dwells a family. They cook in the stalls, and have 
their homes there, sleeping on the floor with no bed but 
some mats. 
In the island of New Guinea are villages where the men 
dwell in clubhouses, while the women live in small huts 
off by themselves. The women do the cooking at the 
huts and bring the meals to their black lords in the club- 
houses, within which they are not allowed to come. 
But suppose we look further into the homes of our 
Philippine cousins. We shall not spend our time with 
those who live in the cities or towns, for the houses there 
are large, and in many respects not unlike our dwellings 
at home. What we would see are the huts and houses of 
cane, thatched with palm leaves, which serve as the homes 
of the poor. There are thousands of these scattered over 
the country in villages, or on the outskirts of the cities. 
Most of them are built upon posts so high up that they 
have to be entered by ladders or stairs. In parts of the 
tropics it is unhealthy to sleep near the ground; and be-- 
sides, there are always reptiles and insects of various kinds 
which must be kept out. 
The houses are usually built close together and those 
of the towns near the shore are shaded by coconut palms, 
We can see the great green and yellow fruit hanging in 
bunches high over the roofs, and now and then a nut

drops to the ground. There are banana patches near many 
of the huts, and here and there is a cluster of low trees, 
whose leaves grow to a length of ten feet or more, and up 
to two feet in width. That is the nipa palm, which fur- 
nishes much of the roofing of this part of the world. The 
leaves are cut off and sewed with fibers to a framework 
of bamboo poles in such a way that they overlap each 
other like shingles, shedding the rain. The framework 
is sometimes made on the ground, and the leaves sewed 
to the pole or rafters, before the roof is raised to its rest- 
ing place on the wall. The walls consist of a framework 
covered with nipa leaves, sewed the same way. 
In nearly every village we find clumps of bamboo, the 
great canes of which with their green feathery branches 
extend high over the houses. These canes form a build- 
ing material which is the most valuable used by primitive 
people throughout the tropics. It serves as the rafters 
and often as the whole framework of the houses. It is 
of the same character as the cane fishing poles sold in our 
country, save that the larger bamboos are as big around 
as one’s leg and as tall as a four or five story house. The 
bamboo is split and pressed out, making splints which 
can be woven like basketwork, and thus take the place of 
wide boards. Walls made of it are especially suited to the 
tropics, where the weather is warm all the year round, and 
the only requirement is to keep out the rain. The woven 
splints serve also for doors, and the holes made for win- 
dows have bamboo shutters which can be raised or slid 
back as desired. The whole canes are for the floors, being 
laid so loosely that the dust and dirt fall through the cracks 
and little sweeping is needed.
-P-A-G-E-43
SOME ODD DWELLINGS OF FAR-AWAY LANDS 43 
Moreover, by cutting out the knots and fitting the pieces 
together the bamboo canes form spouting and piping; and 
one section of a cane with a fiber handle attached makes 
a good bucket for water or milk. Much of the furniture 
of the tropics is made of this wood, and it has other uses 
of various kinds. 
As we go on farther through the Philippine Islands, we 
find large houses made of bamboo, and also of board walls 
with roofs of thatch or tiles. In the larger dwellings the 
windows are sometimes of thin oyster shells set in a lattice- 
work, and those near the cities may have windows of glass. 
The furniture of such dwellings is simple to an extreme, 
consisting of a few chairs or tables and a bed of bamboo 
framework with a netting of ropes over which straw mats 
are stretched.

all of whom have much the same civilization. There are 
other races, however, with other civilizations, whose homes 
are vitally different from ours, some of whom inhabit great 
countries and have much to do with the work of the world. 
This is especially true of the Japanese, Chinese, and East 
Indians who, taken together, number almost one half of

of many islands which have mountains covered with for- 
ests. The lowlands and the valleys are cultivated like 
gardens. There are villages at every few miles, while 
great cities are to be found here and there near the sea. 
The buildings are largely of wood with heavy roofs of 
black tiles or of thatch. They are of all sizes, from the 
one-story hut of two or three rooms, belonging to the poor 
farmer, to the great structures of two or more stories which 
cover a largé area and have many apartments, the homes 
of the rich. There are also countless temples and many- 
storied pagodas.

All the buildings are beautifully made. The Japanese 
are skillful mechanics and their houses are as delicately

  The rooms are covered with straw mats. 
built upon the ground, and then taken apart and set up in 
its place. The walls are of wood so fitted into grooves 
that they can be slid back and forth, turning several rooms 
into one. In many of the houses the outer walls are of 
boards made in sections so that they can be taken away 
during the daytime and the whole house be open. The 
best rooms face the garden, which is often at the back of 
the house. 
Before entering the homes of our Japanese friends we 
take off our shoes and leave them outside. The floors are 
so polished that we can almost see ourselves in them. 
Most of them are carpeted with straw mats about an inch 
thick, a yard wide, and two yards in length; and the size 
of each room is known by the number of mats it takes to

cover it. These mats are so fine and white that no one 
would think of treading upon them in dirty boots. The 
Japanese always leave their shoes outside the houses and 
walk about in bare feet or in the mittenlike stockings they 
usually wear. They sleep on the floor, and at their meals 
sit there upon cushions before tables not quite a foot high. 
They have no heavy furniture, such as large tables and 
chairs, and therefore the thick mats last a long time. 
The Japanese have many big buildings, and in the cities 
they are now erecting business structures like ours. 
They have magnificent temples covering acres, and the 
palaces of their emperor are of enormous size. 
A night’s ride on the ferryboat takes us across Korea 
Strait from Japan to the home of the Koreans, which is 
  “The Korean house is often of the shape of a horseshoe.”

  SOME ODD DWELLINGS OF FAR-AWAY LANDS 47 
now a province of Japan. It is a land of big hats and 
long gowns, and its people dwell largely in houses of wood 
or in huts of stone and mud, roofed with straw thatch. 
The Korean house is often of the shape of a horseshoe, 
the women’s quarters being put at the back. The better 
buildings are not unlike the Japanese. Their roofs are 
heavy and the interior walls are of wood latticework 
backed with white paper. Some of the Korean walls slide 
back and forth, and in other ways their dwellings are 
similar to those of Japan. They are not so well built, 
however, and those of the common people seem mean in 
comparison. 
Leaving Korea and crossing the Yellow Sea, we find 
ourselves in the great world of China, comprising about 
one fourth of the whole human race. The Chinese are so 
ingenious that many of the great inventions, such as the 
compass, gunpowder, and printing, were discovered by 
them. Their history dates back for thousands of years, 
and in the centuries of the past they probably dwelt in 
better homes than those of our ancestors. 
The Chinese homes of to-day are by no means so com- 
fortable as ours, and they lack. many of the things we 
consider necessities. Those of the very poor are squalid 
to an extreme. They are often mud huts made of sun- 
dried bricks, or of clay plastered over a framework of 
bamboo. The roofs are sometimes of thatch, but more 
often of clay or of tiles. The better houses and temples are 
of burnt brick of a bluish gray color with roofs of black or 
gray tiles. They are usually of but one story, although in 
some localities two and three story houses are built. They 
have heavy roofs of a ridge shape, the sides of which are

often curved. The roofs extend out beyond the walls of 
the houses. 
Among the richer Chinese, each family has a number of 
dwellings inside a wall surrounding a large yard known 
as acompound. There are houses for the servants, houses 
for guests, and houses for relatives, in addition to those oc- 
cupied by the family of the rich man himself. The build- 
ings have windows of sliding latticework backed with white 
paper, much like the walls we saw in Japan. Such lattice- 
work is sometimes used for doors as well. Glass is not 
common in the ordinary home and most of the light comes 
in through windows of paper. 
The Chinese have more furniture than the people of 
Japan. Beds, stools, and chairs are common, and there 
are wide wooden benches or lounges upon which they 
often sit or lie as they chat with each other.

The dwellings of the Chinese seldom stand alone. The 
farmers live in closely built villages, and in the towns and 
cities the streets are so narrow that it would be impossible 
for an automobile to pass through them. Hundreds of 
the cities are surrounded 
by brick walls and every 
large town has a wall of 
some kind. These walls 
are of vast extent. Those 
about Peking are twenty 
miles long and those which 
surround Nanking even 
longer. The Peking walls 
are so wide that two motor 
cars could easily pass upon 
them and they are as high 
as a four-story house. Such 
walls were originally made 
for defense and in some of 
the more progressive cities, 
such as Tientsin, they have 
been removed and the space 
where they stood is covered 
with buildings.

ours. The most of them live in villages. It is esti- 
mated that there are more than five hundred thousand 
villages in the country. These villages are composed of 
mud huts with roofs of thatch or tiles. They have no 
comforts to speak of. The ordinary dwelling is often not 
more than fifteen feet square. It is so small that the 
family moves the beds outside during the daytime. The 
houses have no chimneys. The cooking is done on the 
ground or in rude stoves and the smoke gets out as it can. 
The chief fuel is manure and earth mixed together in the 
form of cakes which are plastered on the walls of the huts 
to dry. 
Many of the Indian houses have separate quarters for 
women; and in the larger ones curtains are hung across 
the front doors to keep the men passing by from seeing the 
women within. Such homes have but little furniture. The 
people sit on the floor at their meals, and the ordinary bed 
is a network of ropes fastened to a rude frame of wood 
with legs less than one foot in height. Many sleep on the 
floor, or on the ground outside their huts. 
The East Indians have also large dwellings with bathing 
arrangements, costly rugs, and other comforts. The rich 
live in great luxury, some of them owning palaces of sev- 
eral stories, with many rooms and beautiful gardens. 
In such homes the women and girls have apartments of 
their own into which no men but those of the family are 
permitted to come. The same is true of most of the 
dwellings of India, Turkey, and Persia. According to 
their religion many of the people do not think it proper 
for a woman to be seen by any other men than her hus- 
band, and her brothers and sons. Therefore when a

stranger is about to enter a house he makes a noise to let 
the women know he is coming, and they then disappear. 
In Persia, for instance, no gentleman would enter the 
home of a friend without first stopping on the doorstep, 
and crying out, “ Women away!” 
We might continue our travels from India on into 
Burma, and crossing that country go to Siam. In Burma 
the natives live in houses of basketwork raised upon piles. 
The roofs are often a thatch of grass or palm leaves, and 
the dwellings are simple and easily built. In the low and 
oft-flooded lands of Siam there are many who dwell in 
houses afloat on the water. This is especially so at Bang- 
kok, where thousands of men, women, and children have 
homes of one, two, or more rooms, anchored to piles driven 
down into the Menam River, which flows through that 
city. Each house has steps by which one can go down 
for a swim, and to which the marketing is brought in 
boats every morning. The children play about in canoes 
which they use with great skill. They are good swimmers, 
and they must be so, for their whole lives are spent within 
a few feet of the water. 
In some of the rivers of China there are people who live 
upon boats. There are floating homes built upon rafts and 
in some of these the children play about with little wooden 
barrels fastened to their backs in order that they may be 
kept afloat should they fall off into the water. 
But we shall find it impossible to visit all the homes of 
mankind. They vary everywhere with the civilization and 
the poverty or wealth of the people. They differ accord- 
ing to the building materials by which they are surrounded, 
and also as to the climate, the rains, the heat, and the cold.

half stone and half wood, and there are some which have

stucco, and those of the cities have iron bars over the win- 
dows behind which the little ones play. 
There is no nation on earth, however, which has such 
homelike dwellings as ours, and we shall now return to the 
United States to see something of them and the materials 
from which they are built. 
—oe40o—_ 
6G. HOMES OF COLONIAL DAYS 
UR homes are far different from those of our fore- 
fathers. When the Puritans and Cavaliers crossed 
the Atlantic to settle in the New World, they had to cut 
their dwellings out of the woods. There were no saw- 
mills and planing mills where shingles and boards, window 
sashes and doors, and all sorts of wood ready-made to be 
fitted-into a house, could be bought. There were no hard- 
ware establishments with great stores of nails, screws, 
hinges, and locks of all kinds. There were no brickyards 
or stone quarries or places where one could buy lime, 
cement, and plaster. The whole country was a wilderness 
and the most of it covered with trees which had to be 
chopped down before it could be turned into farms. 
Suppose you were one of a family just landed on 
the shore of a land of this kind with little more than an 
ax, a saw, and a hatchet or so; how would you begin to 
build you a home? You would first look about for some 
kind of shelter in which to stay while you could cut down 
the great trees and erect a log cabin. ;
-P-A-G-E-56
56 HOMES OF COLONIAL DAYS 
That is what many of our great-great-grandparents did. 
They huddled together in caves when they could find 
them; or dug holes into the sides of the hills and made 
shelters there by driving in poles which they supported by 
crotched sticks sunken into the ground at right angles. 
Upon these, as a framework, branches and leaves and grass 
were fastened, making rude walls and a roof, which, added 
to the earth at the back and sides, formed their first homes. 
In many parts of the colonies, and especially in the south, 
they built wigwams like those of the Indians, using mats, 
grass, or deerskins to cover the poles. Farther north 
they had wigwams and houses of bark. Within six years 
after the Pilgrims first landed on Plymouth Rock and began 
to erect their log huts, there were only thirty dwellings on 
the island of Manhattan, and all but one were of bark. 
These rude little shelters were situated on the lower part 
of the island. They stood on the very places which are 
now covered with steel and brick office buildings, some of 
which are thirty, forty, fifty, and even more stories high. 
It was not long after the settlers came before they had 
their log houses under roof. ‘Every man was his own car- 
penter, builder, and furniture maker. He chopped down 
the trees and hewed the logs into lumber. He then called 
upon his neighbors to aid him in putting the structure to- 
gether and in raising the framework for the roof. In some 
places the walls were made of logs from fourteen to eight- 
een feet long set perpendicularly side by side in deep 
trenches, running around a square which formed the floor 
of the dwelling. The earth was then pounded down, and 
the logs fastened together with wooden pins and cross- 
pieces, after which the spaces between were chinked with 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  HOMES OF COLONIAL DAYS 57 
mud. Then a roof of hewn boards or bark shingles, or of 
a framework covered with thatch, was put on, and the main 
part of the house was complete. 
In such cabins the logs were so cut as to leave openings 
for the windows and doors. The windows had wooden 
shutters with hinges of withes or leather, and sometimes 
  Log cabin. 
a sash with panes of greased paper. The doors were of 
boards hewn from logs fastened to crosspieces, with 
wrought iron nails or wooden pins. They were hung upon 
hinges of vines or of leather. Sometimes bark doors and 
shutters were used. 
The furniture consisted of a rude bed, a table, and some 
stools or chairs of rough wood, cut_out-of the trees. The 
huts made of fourteen-foot logs had but one story. Those 
of logs eighteen feet long had usually a loft in addition.
-P-A-G-E-58
I! 
  58 HOMES OF COLONIAL DAYS 
‘Many of the cabins of that time were of logs notched 
near the ends and laid horizontally one upon the others, 
crossing at right angles and forming an oblong or square 
room. Such logs were added, layer by layer, until the 
house was of the desired height, when the framework for 
the roof was raised into place. This was then covered with 
thatch, clapboards, or split shingles. Some of the logs 
were cut shorter to fit into the places where the openings 
for such windows and doors as have been already described 
were to be. 
The house was then made tight, by chinking or filling in 
all the holes and spaces between the logs with mud and 
broken stones and by plastering the spaces with clay. 
The floor was the earth well pounded down; or, in the 
better cabins, it was of split or hewed logs called puncheons. 
A large fireplace was built in one end of the cabin, and 
this formed a part of the great chimney of earth and 
sticks, or of earth and stones laid up on the outside of the 
wall. 
Such houses seem rude to us now, but they were the 
first permanent dwellings of thousands in colonial times. 
They were the homes of the earliest settlers, and as the 
pioneers chopped their way through the woods towards 
the Mississippi Valley each settler erected his log home, 
and, cutting down the forest about it, broke the land for 
his farm. Many such cabins are still to be found in the 
mountains and in the wilder woodlands of our country. 
It was in houses like these that some of the most 
eminent men of our history were born, and to-day we have 
people living in palaces whose fathers or grandfathers 
were born in log cabins, and, as babies, were rocked in
-P-A-G-E-59

sugar troughs. The sugar trough was a short section of 
a big log split in two, and so hollowed out that it could be 
used to catch the sap from the maple trees. In those 
days cans and buckets were scarce, and such troughs 
took their places. A trough was just about big enough to 
hold the baby, and it often formed the rocking and sleep- 
ing place instead of a cradle. 
Captain Miles Standish lived in a log house, and the 
same is true of Captain John Smith and the other colonists 
who founded Jamestown. Not far from Berryville, Vir- 
ginia, I was once shown a log hut in which George Wash- 
ington dwelt when a boy of sixteen. He was then em- 
ployed in surveying a great tract of land belonging to Lord 
Fairfax who paid him five dollars a day, and he used 
this hut as his home. It was not more than twelve feet 
square, and of about the same height, having a ridge roof 
covered with clapboards. The logs which formed the 
walls had been chopped square, and their ends so dove- 
tailed into the corners that but few nails were needed. 
The cabin had two rooms, one above the other. It was 
entered by a door of hewed planks. There were no stairs, 
and the young surveyor who afterwards became the great 
General and President had to stand upon a stool or climb 
a ladder to reach his rude sleeping apartment. 
Presidents Lincoln and Garfield were born in log 
cabins. When ‘Abraham Lincoln was eight years old his 
father moved from Kentucky to Indiana. The family 
traveled on horseback, sleeping at night under the trees. 
When they reached the site of their future home, they 
put up a shed of logs and branches, inclosed on three 
sides, the fourth bzing open; and in this they lived for a a

year. By that time Abraham’s father had built a log 
house about eighteen feet square. The rude structure 
had but one room, 
and little Abe’s 
sleeping place was 
made by fitting some 
slabs into the logs 
overhead, making a 
half loft which was 
reached by a ladder. 
The floor was the 
hard-beaten ground; 
and a_ bedstead, a 
table, and four stools, 
all hewed out of trees, formed the only furniture. There 
was a wide fireplace, and, at the light of this, little Abraham 
Lincoln studied his lessons at night. 
Garfield’s log cabin home, built by his father, Abram 
Garfield, was in northern Ohio, near a tract of forest not 
far from Lake Erie. The nearest house was seven miles 
away. It was built of rough logs to which the bark and moss 
still clung. The roof was of pine slabs, and the walls were 
of logs so notched at the corners that they fitted quite 
close together, the spaces between them being filled up or 
chinked with clay. The house had a floor made of split 
logs hewn smooth with an ax; and its doors were of 
planks hung upon wrought iron hinges. The lock was a 
wooden bar which rose and fell in a wooden socket, as a 
leather string which ran through a hole in the door was 
pulled or let go. At night the string was drawn into 
the house and only those within could open the door.

This string was called the latchstring, and from this custom 
has come the expression denoting hospitality, ‘‘ The latch- 
string is always out for you.” 
In colonial times many of the schoolhouses were made of 
logs, and in some the only desks were boards resting on 
pegs driven at the right height into the logs of the walls 
with benches before them. The teacher’s seat was in the 
center of the room and the older scholars sat at these 
desks facing the walls with their backs to the teacher. 
The younger scholars sat on blocks or benches of logs be- 
tween the desks and the teacher. Such schoolrooms were

The heat came from great fireplaces, the fuel being sent in 
by the parents as part pay for the teaching. It is said that

the child whose parent did not send his wood in on 
time was often forced to sit in the coldest part of the 
schoolroom. 
As our country developed, the homes of the colonists 
began to improve. The cabins became larger. The logs 
were more smoothly hewed and there were many two-story 
dwellings. By and by buildings of clapboards or hewn 
slabs were constructed. Then sawmills were erected, and 
boards came into use. In Virginia, Pennsylvania, New 
York, and New England, the people soon began to build 
dwellings of stone. The first bricks were sent across the 
Atlantic Ocean from Europe. They were burned bricks of 
red and black, and were laid in a checkerboard fashion. 
The windows were made of tiny glass panes which were 
also imported. Many of these houses still stand. 
As the people made more money their homes grew 
better and better, and among them were large and com- 
fortable mansions, such as Arlington, owned by Martha 
  Mount Vernon, the home of Washington.

National Capital.

nificent mansions, and soon after that many other fine 
houses were built. Great public buildings of stone, such as 
our National Capitol and the White House, were erected, 
and other large structures of many kinds were put up in 
various places. As the country increased in wealth and 
population, the business and official buildings grew better 
and better. This has been also the case with the dwell- 
ings of the poor and well-to-do, as well as with those of 
the rich; so that to-day it is safe to say that we have 
the most beautiful, the most substantial, and the most com- 
fortable homes known to man,

oy. travels to-day are to be in the forests. We all 
know that wood has a large part in making our 
homes and we wish to see some of the places from which 
it comes. When the earth was first peopled much of it was 
covered with trees. There were forests wherever the 
climate and rainfall were just right, and that was usually 
along or near great bodies of water. There were dense 
woods everywhere along the banks of the rivers, and upon 
the moist plains, and in the valleys and on the slopes of 
the mountains where the water-laden winds from the ocean 
blew against the cold air of the hills and dropped their 
burden of moisture. Almost the whole of Europe and a 
great part of North America had just these conditions, 
and they were therefore covered with woods. The same 
was true of many parts of Asia, and of much of northern 
Africa which is now bare of trees. But man needed shel- 
ter and fuel, and also cleared land on which to grow crops. 
He has continued cutting away the forests to supply these 
needs and for this reason vast areas of the original woods 
have long since disappeared. 
Nevertheless, there is much woodland left. We. find 
some along nearly all the great rivers, with the exception 
of the lower parts of the Nile and the Ganges. The for- 
ests of the Kongo in Africa are so dense that their shade 
turns the tropical noonday to twilight; and this is also the 
‘case in the vast basins of the Amazon and the Parana 
in South America. Much of our Mississippi Valley is still 
wooded, and the Columbia River flows’ through some of 
the most magnificent forests on earth.

66 IN THE WORLD’S GREAT FORESTS | 
If we could take an airship and make a rapid journey 
over the forest lands of the globe, we should find that 
most of them stand upon this northern hemisphere upon 
which we live, and that the most and best of the timber 
fitted for houses is scattered through the countries run- 
ning around the northern part of this hemisphere. These 
countries are Russia, Norway and Sweden, Germany and 
France and Austria-Hungary in Europe, Siberia in Asia, 
and British America and the United States in our own 
grand division. 
It is true that Africa, South America, and Australia have 
also large forests; but the woods of those countries are 
usually so heavy that they will not float, and the difficulty 
of getting them to the markets is such that they have but 
little part in.the world’s building materials. On the other 
hand, the woods of the northern hemisphere are of such a °   
nature that the logs can be floated to the sawmills or to 
the places where the lumber is most in demand. More- 
over, the climates are such that the snow can often be used 
in dragging the logs to the streams. 
But let us suppose that we are soaring over Europe in 
our airship. We shall imagine that we have our field 
glasses glued to our eyes, and that they are so strong that 
we can take bird’s-eye views of almost the whole continent. 
There are woodlands in all parts of it. Europe has, it is 
estimated, more than seven hundred and fifty million acres 
of timber, and this comprises about one third of its terri- 
tory. The thickest woods are in Russia, in the northern 
part of which are vast forests that have never been touched 
by the ax. The same is true of Finland and of Sweden 
and Norway. Germany, France, and Austria-Hungary 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
IN THE WORLD’S GREAT FORESTS 67 
have also large tracts of valuable trees which have grown 
up within the past few generations, and their governments 
are always setting out more. There are tree nurseries in 
almost every country; for the people of the Old World 
have come to realize the value of forests, and they are 
taking good care of the woods they have left. 
Every country has national forests of great extent, and 
the waste lands belonging to the state are being set out 
with new trees. The lumbering is so carried on that only 
the full grown or ripe trees are cut, and nothing is wasted. 
The same methods are used in the private forests, and as a 
result in some of these countries the supply of timber is 
increasing from year to year. It is different in the United 
States, where, although we have large areas of national 
forests, we are destroying our other woodlands in the 
most wasteful way. But we shall see more of this as we 
go over the country. 
Now we have left Europe and crossed the Atlantic. We 
are taking a bird’s-eye view of North America. Our con- 
tinent still has more and better timber than any other part 
of the world. The forest area of Canada is greater than 
the woodlands of all Europe, and the timber left in the 
United States is even more valuable. The forests of Can- 
ada begin in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick on the At- 
lantic and stretch from there clear to the Pacific, a distance 
of more than three thousand miles. This long belt of woods 
is in places about two hundred miles wide; and fully one 
fourth of it contains timber that will make homes for 
men. North of our Great Lakes are vast regions covered 
with pines, and in British Columbia are to be found some 
of the finest trees of the world.
-P-A-G-E-68
  
  68 IN THE WORLD’S GREAT FORESTS 
But of all the forest regions on earth the most in- 
teresting to us are those of the United States. Moreover, 
they are of all the world still the most valuable, although 
the greater part of the trees which once covered our coun- 
try have been burned and otherwise destroyed in clearing 
the lands.to make farms. At the time the Puritans came 
to New England and Captain John Smith and his colonists 
to Virginia, there was a vast stretch of woods which began 
at the Atlantic Ocean and extended westward to the Mis- 
sissippi River, with the exception of a part of the plains of 
Illinois. West of the Mississippi this forest covered the 
most of Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, and a great part of 
Texas and Oklahoma; and in addition there were extensive 
woodlands in the Rocky Mountains and along the Pacific 
Ocean. 
The forests of that time taken together covered almost 
one half of the land on the main body of the United States. 
Our government experts have estimated that they contained ~ 
so much good wood for building that cut into lumber it 
would have equaled fifty-two hundred billion feet of boards 
one foot wide and one inch in thickness. This amount is 
beyond our comprehension. But if for easy figuring we 
take fifty-two hundred feet instead of fifty-two hundred and 
eighty feet as the length of one mile, and divide the fifty- 
two hundred billion by that, the result is one billion, showing 
that there was lumber enough to make a board walk, a foot 
wide, one billion miles long. Now the distance from the 
earth to the sun is ninety-three million miles and to the 
moon two hundred and forty thousand miles. If we could 
bridge air and space, our lumber would have been suffi- 
cient to cover a street ten feet wide reaching from the

in that forest was perhaps one billion feet board measure, 
a board foot being one foot long, one foot wide, and one 
inch thick. 
Another extensive wooded tract of the East was the 
Southern forest. This began in southern New Jersey and 
* covered all our South Atlantic and Gulf states, as well as 
parts of Texas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. It contained 
many pines, of which the yellow pine was the most nu- 
merous. It covered more than two hundred million acres, 
and had as much timber as the Nerthern forest. 
Between these two was the Central forest, which ex- 
tended from the Atlantic to the great western plain. It 
was composed chiefly of hard woods, and before the clear- 
ing began comprised about two hundred and eighty mil- 
lion acres and contained more than fourteen billion board 
feet of standing saw timbers. This timber was walnut, 
oak, elm, hickory, maple, chestnut, sycamore, red gum, 
and ash, as well as basswood, cottonwood, and some 
other trees. 
The forests of the Rocky Mountains were situated on 
the higher plateaus and slopes. They were almost entirely 
pine and contained less than half the amount of timber 
that stood in either the northern or the southern portions. 
The original extent was not over one hundred and ten 
million acres. 
The Pacific Coast forest was less in area than any of 
these others. It was thickly timbered and the trees were 
so tall that it surpassed in the amount of the good tim- 
ber then standing any of the other forest regions, except- 
ing the hard wood forest of the central belt. This forest 
extended through the greater part of California, and of 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
    72 IN THE WORLD’S GREAT FOKESTS 
Washington and Oregon. It was composed almost alto- 
gether of trees bearing cones, consisting chiefly of Douglas 
fir and redwoods, many of which were two hundred or 
more feet in height and of enormous thickness. In addi- 
tion to these there were vast quantities of fine yellow pines, 
red cedars, sugar pines, and other firs and spruces. 
Such were the woods which we had in our country when 
it came into our hands. Of this vast treasure more than 
one half has already disappeared. By cutting, clearing, 
and forest fires the area of the woods has been so reduced 
that it does not now amount to much more than one fifth 
of the United States proper; and instead of our having 
fifty-two hundred billion feet of lumber still standing we 
have not half that amount. Much less than one third of 
the Northern forest remains. More than one half of the 
Southern forest has been cut away, and of the Central 
forest, we have not one fifth as much as we had when the 
country came into our hands. : 
The woods of the Rocky Mountain region are in a better 
condition. We have from one half to three fourths of 
them left, while in the Pacific Coast forests a much greater 
proportion of the trees are still standing, so that all to- 
gether our forests are still exceedingly valuable. 
Nevertheless, it is sad to think of the vast amount of 
good timber which has been wasted through fires and bad 
lumbering. Of late years the National Bureau of Forestry 
has done much to remedy these evils. Under its direction 
woodlands are being set out in most of the states, the 
national forests are being carefully preserved, and the trees 
are so cut that the ripe timber is turned into lumber, while 
the younger trees are left to grow for the future.

_ the western slope of the Cascade Mountains in 
the state of Washington, in one of the most densely wooded 
regions of the Pacific Northwest. Mighty fir trees, some 
as thick as the Pullman cars in which we crossed the 
Rockies, rise to a height of two or.three hundred feet on 
all sides of us. Their green branches begin at one hundred 
or more feet from the ground, and they are so thick that 
they interlock and shut out the sun. The great trunks 
stand about like mighty columns, and we seem to be in a 
vast cathedral which reaches on and on as far as we can 
see, reminding us of one of Bryant’s Forest Hymns: — 
“The groves were God's first temples. Ere man learned 
To hew the shaft, and lay the architrave, 
And spread the roofabove them, — ere he framed 
The lofty vault, to gather and roll back 
The sound of anthems ; in the darkling wood, 
Amidst the cool and silence, he knelt down 
And offered to the Mightiest solemn thanks 
And supplication.” 
The sounds about us, however, are far different from 
those of a church. We are in the heart of a lumber camp, 
with hundreds of men sawing and chopping away on all 
sides. Not far from where we are standing is a stationary 
steam engine, which puffs and blows as it drags the mighty

There are fallen trees and broken branches everywhere, 
and the older trunks have a thick coating of moss. There 
are giant ferns, and brambles with sharp thorns which 
tear one’s hands and clothes as he makes his way through. 
Not far from where we are the lumbermen are felling a

great Douglas fir. They have made cuts on the opposite 
sides of its trunk five feet from the ground and into these 
have fitted two springboards, upon each of which one of 
them stands. They are making a notch in the tree which 
will give it the right direction for falling. Their axes 
swing alternately, and each cut brings a great chip to the 
ground. By and by the gash in the trunk is so large that

aman could lie down inside it, and this gash determines 
the direction in which the tree will drop when the saw 
has cut its way through. 
A little farther over we see another tree already notched, 
at which the lumbermen are cutting their way through 
the trunk. This is done by a cross-cut saw six feet in 
length, with a man at each end. The work begins at the
-P-A-G-E-77
  OUR LOGGING INDUSTRY 77 
opposite side from the gash. The saw cuts like velvet as 
it eats its way through the soft bark. Now it strikes the 
wood, and the tree seems to shriek as the cruel teeth plow 
their way to its heart. That mighty giant has been hun- 
dreds of years in its growth. It came through the soil 
more than a century before Columbus discovered America, 
and it was one hundred feet high when our ancestors built 
their first log huts on this continent. Nevertheless, these 
men will cut it down in less than an hour, and within a few 
days it will be on its way over the world to make homes 
for man. 
As soon as the tree comes to the ground other men 
take charge of it. They trim off the great branches and 
measure it, cutting gashes upon it twenty, thirty, and 
sometimes forty feet apart, at which places a third set of 
men saw it into logs. 
Each log is now wrapped around with a steel rope, joined 
to the engine, and by this means is dragged over the 
ground to the railroad which has been built to take the 
logs out of the woods. Many of the logs are so heavy 
that they plow up the earth and sometimes tear up smaller 
trees by the roots on the way. A single forty foot log 
from one of the larger trees is a full load for one car, 
containing enough wood to make five thousand feet of 
good lumber. Some of the logs when green will weigh 
from twenty to forty tons, but the steel cable, moved by the 
engine, drags them through the woods to the track, each 
log looking like a huge live worm which sways its head 
this way and that as it goes. 
As the log reaches the railroad, it is raised by another 
cable with heavy hooks on the ends. This passes through 
  t

a block suspended above the car. The hooks are fastened 
into the log, and as the engine is started it reels up the 
cable, dragging or raising the log to the car. 
  Trainload of logs. 
In some of the lumber camps the steam engines move 
the logs to the streams, where they are rafted to the mar- 
kets or to the railroads; and in other parts of the North- 
west they are carried to the sawmills, from where the 
lumber sometimes floats down the mountain in great flumes 
or troughs of boards into which streams have been run. 
In California, in the heart of the Sierra Nevada, is a mill 
which has a flume sixty miles long. The lumber is thrown 
into this and it goes flying down to the trains and the 
market. 
In many parts of the Cascades the logs are sawed not 
far from where they are cut and the lumber is carried on 
the railroads to the cities. In other regions the logs are 
floated down the Columbia, and from some places they go
-P-A-G-E-79
  OUR LOGGING INDUSTRY 79 
into Puget Sound and are thence rafted to the great mills on 
its shores. Some rafts are so built that they can be towed 
by steamers from Puget Sound down to San Francisco and- 
other ports; and on the Columbia River are similar rafts 
which are taken out into the Pacific Ocean and towed to 
the markets. 
These giant rafts are often as large as the biggest ocean 
steamer. One constructed on the Columbia was seven 
hundred feet long, fifty-three feet wide, and thirty feet 
deep. It drew about twenty feet of water and contained 
all together seven thousand logs. This great mass was 
placed within a cradle much like the hull of an ocean 
steamship, and so wrapped around with chains that it was 
safely carried down through the Columbia, and: along the 
coasts of Oyegon and California, to the Golden Gate and

San Francisco Bay, a distance of more than seven hundred 
miles. 
- In our great forest regions east of the Rocky Mountains 
most of the lumbering is done in the winter, the logs being 
loaded on sledges, and carried on roads of ice or snow to 
the streams. The snow for the roads is often beaten hard 
and then sprinkled with water, which freezing, turns it to

ice. Some of the sledge loads are enormous, comprising 
forty or fifty logs sixteen feet long, containing many 
thousand feet of fine lumber. The sledges are drawn by 
teams of four, six, eight, and even more horses. When 
the loads reach the streams the logs are rolled out upon 
the ice, where they remain until spring. As the warm 
weather comes the ice melts, and the freshets carry the 
logs down to the rivers and lakes, where they are formed 
into rafts and floated or towed to the market.
-P-A-G-E-81
OUR LOGGING INDUSTRY 81 
The men who go with these rafts sometimes live in rude 
shanties which they build uponthem. They are very expert, 
and run over the logs as they bob up and down and roll 
about in the water. They know just how to get the logs 
apart if they should pile up in one place, and how to keep 
them from jamming together as they are carried over the 
rapids or falls. When a jam occurs, one or two logs often 
form a key, which when pulled out releases the whole 
mass. The drivers, as they are called, understand where 
these keys are and drag them out with cant hooks. Such 
work is dangerous, and the men engaged in it are some- 
’ times caught and crushed by the flying timbers, or dragged 
under the water and drowned. 
In the southern forests the logs are taken to the streams 
by engines over the railroads or by wagons drawn by long 
teams of oxen or horses. They are put together in rafts, 
upon some of which the lumbermen and their families live 
as they float down to the seaports. 
The trees of the Eastern forests are much smaller than 
those of the Pacific Coast, and most of the logs can, if 
necessary, be handled without the aid of machinery. 
Nevertheless the amount of timber cut is enormous. Dur- 
ing the ten years from 1880 to 1890 it has been estimated 
that enough logs were floated to the markets from Minne- 
sota, Michigan, and Wisconsin to have made a solid pile 
four times as wide as the average country road and as high 
as a four-story house, reaching across our continent from 
New York to San Francisco. 
We enjoy the life of the lumber camp. The air is fresh, 
and flavored with the rich smell of the pines and the saw- 
dust and chips of the newly cut logs. The lumbermen,

although rough in many ways, are full of good nature, and 
they make us at home. They show us their shoes, the 
soles of which are studded with sharp spikes which dig 
into the bark as they walk over the great logs and give 
them sure footing. We go with them to the camp and 
eat at the long pine table arourid which they gather at 
meals. Our plates are of tin and we have tin cups and 
bowls and tin spoons and steel forks. The food consists 
of soup, corned beef, potatoes, and canned goods of sev- 
eral varieties. We have excellent bread and cakes made 
by the camp cook, baked beans which remind us of 
Boston, and end our meal with mince pie hot from the 
stove. We are told that this diet is often varied with 
venison, squirrels, wild birds, and other game, shot in the 
woods. 
We stay overnight with the loggers, sleeping on straw 
ticks in the wide bunks, built in tiers around the walls 
of the rude log house in which they live. Before going 
to bed one of our friends brings out a fiddle, and we laugh 
as we see these grown men dancing together. We turn in 
very early, for we are tired after our long day in the forest. 
By nine o'clock the lights are out. We fall asleep almost 
immediately, and do not wake until morning. 
There are hundreds of such lumber camps in the Cas- 
cade Mountains, and a vast number very similar to them 
in California and in the Eastern forest regions of the 
United States. 
All together we have several hundred thousand men 
engaged in the lumber industry, and the business is so 
extensive that its product often sells for more than a half 
billion dollars a year.

Africa. Others are taking on lumber for San Francisco

But come with me to the other end of the yard. We 
are looking down upon a bay or inlet with a narrow strait 
leading out to the Sound. The surface of the bay is 
covered with logs, floating about, awaiting the saws. Some 
of the logs are thirty or more feet in length, and many are 
as big around as a hogshead. Several men are moving 
about upon them, pushing them, one by one, to a great 
chute which extends from the water up to the mill.

As the logs near the chute, they are caught by steel 
hooks on the ends of thick chains, and are dragged by the 
“engines to the floor of the mill. They move as though 
they were alive, looking like gigantic snakes, as they crawl 
out of the water and on up the trough. There comes one

now. It is five feet thick, forty feet long, and it weighs 
many tons. Nevertheless it flies aloft as though it were 
no more than a broom handle, and drops like a stick on 
the floor. Now great iron arms rise out of holes on each 
side of it. They catch it with their steel talons and roll it 
upon a truck which rests upon wheels on a track. One 
of the mill men pulls a lever, and the truck, moving for- 
ward, carries the log against a band saw, the teeth of which 
cut through it as though it were cheese. ’ 
See, a great slice has been pared from one side! _It flies 
back, and another slice drops off from the side opposite. 
Now a steel arm with a talon at the end rises out of the 
floor and turns the log, so that the cut sides lie beneath 
and on top, while four other arms reach up and arrange it 
in place on the truck. The two remaining sides are sliced 
off in the same way, and our log has become a square

on to other machines in which they are again.cut, and 
finally come out in just the right widths. They are now 
carried on to the drying rooms, and later to the planers, 
where they are smoothed and tongued and grooved. 
Other kinds of lumber are cut in the same way, the 
machinery doing so much of the work that the log is 
scarcely touched by man’s hand from the time it leaves the 
water until in its finished state it is piled upon the steamers 
or cars for shipment to market. 
We must keep our eyes open as we go through the 
mill. It is so noisy that, scream as we may, we cannot 
make our friends hear. The screeching of the saws is 
such that the men who do the work are directed by signs. 
They are all under the head sawyer, who might be called 
the brains of the machinery and who is paid very high 
wages. He stands under an electric light in about the 
center of the mill with his hands upon the levers which 
control the sawing. He motions the men at the trucks to 
touch such other levers as will so cut the logs as to produce 
the most and best lumber, and a few mistakes might cost 
his employers hundreds of dollars. 
Now look at the saws. They are different from any 
used by our ancestors when they built the board houses of 
colonial times. Then and for a long time thereafter, 
most of the building materials were sawed out by hand. 
One method was by the pit saw operated by two men. 
The pit sawyer stood in a pit over which the log was 
placed and pulled the saw down, while the other, known as
-P-A-G-E-87
FROM LOG TO LUMBER 87 
the top sawyer, standing upon the log, drew it back in the ' 
opposite direction. The first circular saw was invented in 
England about 1777, but was not employed in America 
until many years later. Such saws are used now in the 
smaller mills of our country, but the great band saws 
  
    
Interior of mill with a band saw. 
and gang saws, such as we see here, are common only in 
the larger establishments. 
The band saw is an endless strip or belt of steel, with 
teeth on one or both edges, so made that it can be fitted 
over two large wheels, one high above the floor and the 
other below it. The wheels are moved by engines, and 
as they go the steel belt flies around rapidly, its teeth cut- 
ting through everything that comes against them. One of 
the band saws of our mill is eighty feet long, and it rapidly 
cuts its way through the great logs as they are shoved 
against its sharp and fast-moving teeth. 
   
-P-A-G-E-88
  88 : FROM LOG TO LUMBER 
The gang saw consists of a dozen or more circular saws 
parallel with each other, and so fastened to a spindle that 
they fly around at the same time. The saws can be so 
graduated that boards of any thickness desired aré cut 
by them. The great log moves against them, and their 
teeth saw out a dozen or more boards at once. 
Among the other machines used in our lumber mills are 
steam planers, which smooth the wood; lathes, which turn 
it into all sorts of shapes; and finishing machines for mak- 
ing moldings, panels, window-sash, doors, and woodwork of 
all kinds. 
Every large lumber mill has its blacksmith shop where 
the breakages are repaired, and a department in which the 
men do nothing but file saws. There are also great kilns 
lined with steam pipes to dry the lumber, and special 
machines for carrying it out and loading it upon the steam- 
ers and cars. 
The United States has many sawmills with machinery 
much like that in the one we have visited. It has hun- 
dreds in or near the Pacific Coast forest, and in our north- 
ern and southern forests. There are also many smaller 
mills scattered throughout the timber regions. Altogether 
we have more than eleven thousand lumber mills, which in 
some years cut twenty or thirty billion feet of lumber, board 
measure. We have hundreds of mills that make lath and 
other cheap lumber, and more than two thousand whose 
productis shingles. Indeed, a large part of our nation sleeps 
under shingles from the Pacific Coast forest, such roofing 
selling for millions of dollars a year. In the shingle mills 
the logs go in as bolts, and pass through machines provided 
with a series of knives which cut many shingles at once.  
-P-A-G-E-89
FROM LOG TO. LUMBER 89 
In our travels through the timber regions we may learn 
something of the kinds of wood most used in our houses, 
and the places from whence they come. The greater part 
of it is yellow pine, including therein all the pine lumber 
cutin the eastern half of the United States, excepting the 
white and Norway pine. This yellow pine comes chiefly 
from Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, and 
Alabama, and in lesser. quantities from Georgia, Florida, 
South Carolina, and Virginia. 
After it we have the white pine, the annual product of 
which is often several billion feet. This is from the 
northern forests, and especially from the states about 
Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron. Next come the 
Douglas fir and Oregon pine, of which we saw something 
in our Washington lumber camp, and after them the hem- 
lock, of which Pennsylvania cuts most, and then the spruce, 
cyprus, white oak, and other hard woods. 
In addition to the wood used for building, a vast amount 
is needed for other purposes. Our railroads consume 
many millions of ties every year. We use an enormous 
quantity for furniture. We require millions of telegraph 
and telephone poles, and many acres of trees are cut down 
to make staves for barrels. The toothpick is little more 
than a splinter, but there is a single factory in Mainé which 
makes a half billion of them every year; and we have 
other establishments which turn out lead pencils, clothes- 
pins, and wooden spools by the hundreds of millions. 
Several hundred acres of virgin forests are used annually 
for matches, and more than three thousand acres of hard 
wood trees are, it is estimated, cut up into shoe pegs. 
There are also vast quantities of hard wood used for
-P-A-G-E-90
90 WOODWORKING IN OTHER LANDS 
carts, carriages, and cars of all kinds. A great deal of 
soft wood goes into buckets and baskets, to say nothing of 
the other soft wood trees which are annually cut down to 
be ground into wood pulp for the making of cardboard, 
and the paper which we use for wall coverings and for our 
newspapers and books.

friends there are getting ready for bed. Here the sun is

just rising in the eastern heavens, and day has begun. 
Perhaps some of us can tell why this is? 
But our business here is to find out how woodworking 
is done, and to see whether it is really true that elephants 
help the Burmese build their houses. To do this we shall
-P-A-G-E-91
  
  WOODWORKING IN OTHER LANDS gI 
first go to the great forests of teak which cover a large 
part of the peninsula of Farther India. The teak trees 
are tall, straight, and beautiful, and they make excellent 
lumber. They grow in tropical parts of the world and 
therefore there is no snow or ice on which to sledge the 
logs out. Much of the forest stands in the swamp and it 
would be difficult to lay railroads upon it or even to drive 
over it with carts. For these reasons elephants are used 
to drag the logs to the streams. 
Teakwood is heavy, and the trees are girdled several 
years before they are cut. This causes the leaves to 
wither and the trees to die; the sap goes out of them 
and they become so light that they will float. They are 
now cut down with axes and saws, and chopped into logs. 
Then chains are wrapped around them, and one by one 
they are taken off to the streams. This is done by ele- 
phants, which are hitched by chains to the logs. After a 
time the paths become troughs, into which the water oozes 
and makes them so slippery that the logs slide along more 
easily. Now and then a log catches its end in the mud, 
whereupon the elephant stops and lifts it out with his 
tusks, and then moves it onward. The elephants push the 
logs apart when they pile up in the water; they also pull 
them out with their trunks and tusks, and lift them over 
the shoals. Only strong elephants are used for such 
work, the best logging animals being thirty, forty, or even 
more years of age. 
We shall now suppose we have left the forests and have 
come to the lumber yards of the port of Rangoon near the 
mouth of the Irrawaddy River. Here many logs are 
sawed into lumber for use in house building, and also to
-P-A-G-E-92
92 WOODWORKING IN OTHER LANDS 
be exported to other parts of the world. Teak is one of 
the best of all woods for ships, and it is also valuable for 
making fine furniture. The yard we visit lies on the 
banks of the river. It has sawmills and planing mills, and 
we can see its great piles of timber before we come to it. 
Entering, 
we find a score 
of elephants 
aiding the 
workmen; or 
we might bet- 
ter say that the 
                
    
   men are aiding the 
elephants, for it is 
the huge beasts 
which do the heavi- 
est labor. They lift 
the great logs upon 
their tusks and carry them from one side of the yard to 
the other. They pile the lumber; and, when one of them 
cannot raise a timber to the place where it should be, he 
will often rest one end on the top of the pile and then lift- 
ing the other with tusks and trunk, give it a kick with his 
hind foot, which shoves it into its place. The elephants 
gather up the scraps of lumber and lay them so that the 
workmen can rope them into bundles. After this they They lift great logs upon their tusks. 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
  
  WOODWORKING IN OTHER LANDS 93 
will thrust their tusks through the ropes and take the 
bundles as they are told. They drag the logs to the saw- 
mills and carry the boards to the steamers. Each of the 
great beasts has a man on his back, who directs him with 
a goad, at the end of which is a sharp hook. The ele- 
phant knows just what each touch of the goad means, and 
if he does not obey, the driver jabs him in the ear with the 
hook. 
The elephants are intelligent. They know the hours 
during which their work is done. They grow restless as 
noonday approaches, and at twelve o’clock, when the 
whistle sounds, they will drop whatever they have on 
their tusks and bolt for the feeding sheds. It is the 
same when work stops at night. 
We talk with the drivers and are told that the great 
beasts must be handled just so. Each has his bath twice 
a day, and, after this, is curried all over. The elephant is 
a sensitive creature. It cannot endure certain insects, and 
if the smallest bug creeps under its saddle, the huge beast 
will not work until it is removed. The largest elephant 
will tremble at the sight of a mouse, for fear, perhaps, that 
the little animal may run up its trunk. 
We say good-by to the drivers on leaving, and throw 
them some coins. They rub the elephants’ heads with 
their heels, whereupon the huge beasts raise their trunks 
high into the air and give us a royal salute. 
These elephants are valuable animals. A full grown 
one will bring as much as a thousand dollars, and a prize 
worker several times that. They are caught in the forests 
of upper Burma. The wild ones are often captured in pits 
or corrals, being enticed there by tame elephants trained 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  
  94 WOODWORKING IN OTHER LANDS 
for the purpose. When a wild herd is found, the tame 
beasts are let loose and allowed to mix with them. The 
latter follow the commands of their masters, and lead the 
herd into the corrals. The men then rush in and close the 
openings, after which the wild elephants are easily caught. 
Traveling northward from Burma we cross over the 
mountains and spend some time in moving about through 
the great empire of China. This is one of the old lands 
of the world. The country has been thickly populated for 
ages, and the most of the forests have long since disap- 
peared. There is no saw milling industry, such as is found 
in our country and Europe, and the methods of woodwork- 
ing are crude. Boards are usually sawed out by hand; and 
the planing is done by the carpenters, who, block by block, 
work every bit into shape. 
  Making boards in China. 
The sawing of lumber may be seen in all the Chinese 
cities, and we pass many log yards as we walk through the

streets. The logs are stood upon end instead of being: laid 
flat as with us, and each is marked with a Chinese char- 
acter which tells what it is. In turning a log into boards 
it is laid upon the ground with one end raised a little 
higher than the head of a man, and the sawing is done by 
two workmen with a cross-cut saw. One of the men 
stands above the log, and the other beneath it, and they 
pull alternately, thus sawing the logs. The work seems 
costly, but we learn that the wages here are so low that it 
is almost as cheap 
as though done by 
machinery. Such 
lumbering methods 
are employed here 
and there all over 
Asia. They are in 
use in many parts

The next stop in our travels is Japan, a country which 
now has sawmills and planing machinery, although much 
of its woodwork is still cut out by hand. We find the 
houses beautifully built. The Japanese are among. the 
most skillful of all the world’s workmen, and even the 
common carpenter is a cabinetmaker. We visit temples 
which are masses of carving, and observe that the walls of 
the buildings move back and forth as easily as the drawers 
ofabureau. Wespend some time watching the carpenters,
-P-A-G-E-96
    96 WOODWORKING IN OTHER LANDS 
observing that their methods of doing many things are just 
the opposite of ours. When a man planes he pulls the 
plane towards him, and in using the drawing knife he 
pushes it from him. We begin our houses on the ground, 
and work up to the roof. The Japanese makes the roof 
first. He then puts it together upon a scaffolding of poles, 
and fills in the framework beneath. 
This method of roof-making is not confined to Japan. 
In Java the people often build the roof, which is of palm 
leaves and bamboo cane, on the ground, and then carry it 
to the framework of the house, where it is raised into 
place. In such cases the men bearing the roof walk in- 
side it, so that the roof seems to be crawling along like a 
centipede, on numerous legs. 
The bamboo isa favorite wood for buildings of many 
kinds in both Japan and China. It is cultivated for the 
purpose, and Japan has forests of well-kept bamboo trees 
which are cut and sold for timber. The Chinese use bam- 
boo for more purposes than any other wood. It forms the 
scaffolding, inside which they build their houses. They 
tie the poles together, forming a framework more solid 
than though it were put up with bolts. They use bamboo 
for furniture, making chairs, tables, stools, and couches of 
it. It forms the carrying pole of the coolie, the ribs for 
the sails of the boatmen, and the rain hat of the farmer. 
It is the staff of the small-footed old woman, and the stick 
upon which the blind beggar leans. It is the measuring 
rod of the carpenter, and the handle of his tool. It is also 
largely employed in making toys for children, pen handles 
for scholars, cages for birds, and coops for chickens. The 
Chinese boy often sleeps on a bamboo bed, resting his

head on a bamboo pillow, which is a framework that fits 
under his neck. The Japanese use this wood for making 
paper, and it is also employed for medicine, while the 
young bamboo shoots are eaten for food. 
Another wood of many uses is the palm. This does not

chief building wood of some tropical lands. It is of many 
varieties, and is employed in all sorts of ways. It is the 
principal timber of the Desert of Sahara, and the houses 
of the oases, which are composed largely of mud, have 
their doors and windows framed with the rough boards 
cut from the date palm. The’ coconut palm thrives 
in the warm islands of the Pacific, where it is used for

building. It is more valuable, however, for its nuts and 
the thick husks which surround them. The nuts are sold 
for making oil, and the fibers of the husks, loosened by 
soaking them in water, are twisted into yarn, from which 
is woven the coarse carpet or matting known as coir. 
The leaves of the nipa palm take the place of shingles 
upon many of the houses of the Pacific Islands. They 
are sewed together with fiber, and tied to the bamboo 
rafters. They are also employed to cover the walls. The 
betel palm’ has a nut which is chewed by the natives of 
Siam, Malaysia, and the islands of the Dutch East Indies, 
much as some people chew tobacco. The carnauba palm 
has not only a fiber which the natives of Brazil use for 
hammocks and other purposes, but from its leaves oozes 
forth a wax which makes excellent candles. In some 
years millions of pounds of this wax are sold for house 
lighting.

11. AMONG THE RUINS OF SOME GREAT 
BUILDINGS OF THE PAST 
HE next field of our travels relates to stone as a build- 
ing material, but before visiting the great quarries 
from which it comes, we would see something of how it 
was used in the past. It was ages after the half-naked 
savage built his hut of rough stones that mighty structures 
were erected of marble and granite. These were first 
made, not as homes for the living, but as tombs in honor 
of kings, or as temples for the worship of gods. 
Some of the oldest of such monuments are in Egypt on
-P-A-G-E-99

the banks of the Nile. Let us visit the Great Pyramid. 
We are standing on the sands of the desert about five 
miles from Cairo. The green Valley of the Nile running 
north and south lies between us and the city, but skirting 
it and extending back from it on all sides as far as we can 
see is a vast plain of gray sand and rock, out of which rises 
a mighty pile of stone so wide and high that as we stand 
close beside it it seems a wall to the sky. Its base covers 
thirteen acres, and it is laid up in terraces or steps of huge 
blocks of stone, some of which are as high as a table and 
many feet long. It has four sloping sides, which narrow 
as they rise and end at the top in a platform big enough 
to make the foundation for a good sized cottage. 
We:hire several black-skinned, white-gowned Bedouin 
boys as our guides, and climb up. The stones are so big 
that we have to be pulled and pushed from one terrace to 
another, and it is some time before we get to the top. The 
blocks are piled up in layers, fitted so closely that at first 
the whole seems one mass of stone. 
In descending, we make our way around to a little 
hole on the. thirteenth terrace in the northern side of 
the structure, and find there a narrow, slanting pas- 
sageway, up which we crawl or our hands and knees to 
the two large chambers within. They are as dark as 
night, and bats fly past us as we enter. We have elec- 
tric lamps in our pockets and by pressing a button get 
enough light to see well about us. The chambers are 
floored, walled, and ceiled with granite, polished as smooth 
as a mirror, and so closely laid that we cannot insert a 
knife blade in the cracks. These rooms were made about 
five thousand years ago to contain the bodies of King

Cheops and his wife. They lay there for ages, but from 
time to time the pyramid has been torn open by treasure 
hunters. The mummies and the things buried with them 
have long since disappeared, and now only a huge granite 
sarcophagus or coffin remains. 
This pyramid was more than twenty years in construc- 
tion, and it is recorded that one hundred thousand men 
worked upon it during a great part of that time. The 
Greek historian, Herodotus, relates that the onions, garlic, 
and radishes furnished the laborers cost almost two million 
dollars and that it took years to make the road over which 
the materials were carried. The stones of the pyramid 
numbered more than two millions, and of those that wall 
the king’s chamber, single blocks weigh sixty tons. It is 
estimated that the structure contains so much stone that if 
it could be split into flags four inches thick, it would be 
enough to pave a road two feet wide over sea and land 
clear around the globe. 
Traveling up the Valley of the Nile, we see other pyra- 
mids standing here and there in the desert, and after some 
days on our steamer reach Luxor, near the site of Thebes, 
an ancient city which had more than a million people. 
Thebes had walls so thick that chariots drawn by a half 
dozen horses could easily pass as they galloped around 
them. It had one hundred gates, and its temples and 
palaces were among the world’s wonders. The homes of 
that day have long since passed away, but the ruins of 
some of the temples are still to be seen. We visit one 
at Karnak about two miles from Luxor, the huge stones 
of which, ranged about courts of enormous extent, cover 
many acres. In one court the roof was upheld by immense

fifteen feet thick, many of which are still standing. These

columns are beautifully carved. They were erected, it is 
said, by King Menes more than forty centuries ago. The 
temple contained statues of gold and ivory studded with 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
AMONG THE RUINS OF SOME GREAT BUILDINGS 103 
jewels. It was for about two thousand years one of the 
most sacred places in Egypt. 
Among the other things here are two obelisks, great 
shafts of stone like that which was brought from Egypt 
to New York and now stands in Central Park. The 
obelisks were quarried by ancient masons from hills of 
granite not far north of Luxor near Assouan, and some 
of them were carried down the Nile on rafts or boats 
to Alexandria, on the Mediterranean Sea. Others were 
set up at Thebes and some at Heliopolis, and at other 
cities along the great river. 
Our own obelisk stood for centuries at Alexandria. 
When it was loaded for its long trip to New York a hole 
was cut in the bow of the steamer in order to admit it, and 
it was dragged through that hole into the ship. Some 
years before that another of the obelisks had been taken 
to London, being transported there in an iron water-tight 
cylinder which was carried to Egypt in pieces and built 
around the huge stone as it lay on the shore. After being 
encased, the great cylinder was rolled into the sea» and a 
steamship towed it to London. 
Is it not wonderful that these men who lived four thou- 
sand years ago could make such beautiful things out of 
stone, and could carry such heavy masses far down the 
Nile? It seems still more wonderful when we remember 
that they did this ages before man discovered how to use 
steam or electricity, and many centuries before he had 
invented machinery to aid in his building. 
Returning southward to Alexandria, a few days by 
steamer takes us across the Mediterranean Sea to Athens, 
where, on a great hill of rose-colored limestone, stood

  The Parthenon. 
the Parthenon, one of the most beautiful marble temples 
ever erected. We drive to the foot of the Acropolis, as 
this hill is called, and wind our way to the top. We 
are now five hundred feet above Athens, with magnifi- 
cent views of the mountains and the blue Mediterranean 
and its numerous islands. All about us lie huge broken 
columns and other pieces of marble beautifully carved. 
The ruins of temples stand here and there, and upon a 
marble platform, covering almost half an acre, are some 
of the columns which once upheld the temple in which 
stood the gold and ivory statue of Athena, the Goddess 
of Wisdom. This temple was the Parthenon. It was 
made of white marble, from the quarries of Mount Pen- 
telikon not far away. The marble blocks were laid up 
without mortar, the columns being of cylindrical sections 
roughly hewed and finished after they had been placed 
in position. The front of the Parthenon was covered with
-P-A-G-E-105
  AMONG THE RUINS OF SOME GREAT BUILDINGS 105 
carvings, many of which have been broken off and carried 
to the British Museum at London. Some still stand, and 
some are now in the Museum at Athens. 
We shall find other great works of marble built by the 
Romans in Italy, and also in northern Africa and Asia 
Minor, where they had colonies before the Christian era. 
In Rome itself they had magnificent structures formed of 
the marble which came from the mines of Carrara not far 
away. These buildings consisted of palaces, temples, and 
open-air theaters. The chief of the last-named was the 
Colosseum, a massive circus of stone and brick, inside 
which lions, elephants, and tigers fought together before 
the eyes of the people. They fought also with the glad- 
iators, and the latter 
fought each other. In 
this place were held 
real sea fights, made by 
‘flooding the arena, and 
chariot races, and many 
other. entertainments. 
The Colosseum had 
seats for more than 
eighty thousand specta- 
tors. It covered seven 
acres, comprising an 
arena or show place 
level with the ground 
and a series of galleries 
running around it ex- 
tending upward in ter- [| 
races until it reached A column of the Parthenon.

the top of the walls at the back. The walls were one 
hundred and sixty feet in height, and when the sun was 
hot, an enormous canvas was stretched over them as a 
roof. The building contained many rooms, including 
cages for lions, tigers, and elephants.

A bit of marble carving from the Temple of Baalbek. 
Traveling from Rome to Naples by train we take ship 
there and steam to Beirut in Syria, from whence a few hours’ 
ride upon the railroad carries us over the first range of the 
Lebanon mountains to the famed ruins of Baalbek. These 
are the remains of a mighty temple of marble erected by 
the Romans to the worship of the heathen god Baal. 
The temple was built when the Roman Empire was in the 
height of its glory, and it was beyond description mag- 
nificent. Inside it was a solid gold statue of the god, rep- 
resenting a young man clad in armor and accompanied

by two golden bulls. He held a whip in his right hand, 
and a thunderbolt and some ears of corn in his left. The 
temple had also statues of many others of the gods of the 
Romans, including Mercury and Venus. 
The stones of this temple are gigantic. Some of the 
marble columns are as big around as a hogshead, and 
fifty or sixty feet long. They are put together in sec- 
tions, and their capitals are exquisitely carved. In the 
foundation are great blocks of stone thirty-five feet long, 
twelve feet wide, and thirteen feet thick. Some of them 
are estimated to weigh more than fifteen hundred tons 
each; but notwithstanding their great size and weight 
they were carried over the hills from the quarries and 
placed in the walls without breaking. Such feats of 
engineering would be considered wonderful by our builders 
to-day. 
As we look at the structure our guides ask us to visit 
the quarries, and see a stone which was cut out for the 
temple but which for some reason was left where it lay. 
We go with them and take measurements of it. The 
great block lies on the ground just outside the quarry 
with one end half buried in the earth. We climb up and 
take a run up and down it. It is just fourteen feet thick, 
and so wide that two automobiles could be driven abreast 
upon its face without falling over the sides. The length 
is seventy feet and if it were stood upon end, it would be 
as high as a six- or seven-story house. This huge mass 
is one solid stone, which was cut out for the temple. It is 
just like others which were carried there from this quarry 
and lifted to place. 
Traveling on around the world we stop now and then

to see other famous structures built by the people of cen- 
turies past. At Agra on the banks of the Jumna River, 
in the heart of India, we visit the Taj Mahal, which is 
perhaps the most beautiful marble building ever erected. 
Travelers have called it a poem in stone; and one has 
said that it would be as easy to tell how the birds sing 
or the lilacs smell as to describe it. It is an ivory white 
mosque or tomb, covering acres, rising to a height one 
third as great as that of the Washington Monument, and 
ending in a dome which seems to float in the sky. The 
Taj Mahal is of the purest white marble, and the dome 
looks like a silvery bubble which might have been blown 
from the mouth of the heathen god Atlas, who, the an- 
cient Greeks imagined, held up the skies on his shoulders. 
    “The Taj Mahal is of the purest white marble.’’  
-P-A-G-E-109
  
AMONG THE RUINS OF SOME GREAT BUILDINGS 109 
The Taj was inlaid with jewels, and in it are screens of 
marble latticework in patterns as exquisite as beautiful 
lace. It was built by a Mohammedan sultan, who was 
born just one hundred years after Columbus discovered 
America, and it was erected by him in memory of his 
wife. Near it stand other temples and palaces, includ- 
ing a building of marble so beautiful that those who 
made it engraved in Arabic letters upon its walls: “If 
there is a Paradise on earth, it is this! It is this! It is 
this!” 
In the interior of the island of Java, we find a stone 
monument or temple which was erected to Buddha so long 
ago that the natives cannot tell when. It covers an area 
more than one half as large as that of the Pyramid of 
Cheops, rising in terraces decorated with statues and won- 
derful carvings in great profusion. I once counted eight 
carved figures on the stone walls in a space a yard square; 
and it is estimated that all the carvings if stretched out 
in one line would extend three miles. The statues about 
the monument number hundreds, and some of them are 
giants in stone. 
Going northward to Peking in China we visit the Temple 
of Heaven, another mighty structure of marble. It con- 
sists of a great platform upon which the Emperor kneels 
when he sacrifices and prays for his people. In our own 
hemisphere in the wilds of Yucatan are the ruins of stone 
cities built by the Indians with their stone tools long, long 
ago. Moreover, scattered throughout Europe are magnifi- 
cent cathedrals of stone built during the Middle Ages, 
and here and there are the ruins of stone castles in which 
the kings, knights, and barons of those days held their

structures of the past. It is so used to-day. Our finest 
public buildings are made of granite or marble; and the 
brown stone mansion which Oliver Wendell. Holmes jok- 
ingly refers to in the verse which begins this chapter is 
often spoken of as the home of the rich. We have, how- 
ever, such a wealth of building stone in our country that 
it forms a large part of the dwellings of the people who 
are not wealthy; and by machinery the cost of fitting it 
for buildings has been so reduced that the stone house is 
within the purse of many men. Moreover, stone is used 
in all sorts of dwellings in combination with wood, brick, - 
concrete, or steel; and we have few cottages so poor that 
they are not built upon stone foundations. 
Indeed, the demand for building stone is such that getting 
it out and preparing it for the market has become one of 
our chief industries. We have vast sums of money invested 
in quarries, and their annual product sells for more than 
fifty million dollars. Thousands of men are kept busy 
taking out the stone and in cutting and preparing it for 
use. Other thousands are engaged in transporting it to 
the markets, and still others in laying it up in the various 
forms needed for building. 
Before visiting the quarries, we should know something 
of the various kinds of stone most used. We have seen 
some of these in our travels among the ruins of the past. 
We found granite in the great temples at Thebes, marble 
in the Parthenon at Athens, and sandstone in some of the 
cathedrals and castles of medieval Europe. The best 
building stones are those which are strongest, most durable, 
and most easily worked. Of all, granite is-perhaps_the 
nearest perfection, although it crumbles under intense

heat. It has been used for ages, and is found to last the 
longest of all. It is very hard and it contains minerals of 
several kinds. 
  
  Cutting columns of Maine granite. 
Our chief granite beds are in Maine and Massachusetts, 
although we have extensive deposits in many other parts 
of the Union. Granite is quarried in every state border- 
ing on the Appalachian Range, and also in California, 
Colorado, Wyoming, Wisconsin, and Missouri. The New 
England granite is chiefly gray in color, although there are 
red and pink granites, and, indeed, some of nearly all 
colors from light gray to black. Fine red granite is quar- 
ried in Nova Scotia, Scotland, and Sweden. The red 
granite of Assouan near Thebes is close grained, and it 
takes a beautiful polish. 
We all know what sandstone is, although perhaps not 
many of us could tell every kind of stone which goes by that 
name. Allsandstones are composed of rounded or angular 
grains of sand cemented together by other materials so as 
to form a solid rock. The cementing materials are certain 
forms of iron, lime, and silica, and the color of the stone
-P-A-G-E-113
  A VISIT TO THE QUARRIES 113 
varies much according to the cementing mixture and also 
as to the size of the grains of which it is composed. 
Some sandstones are gray, others blue, yellow, brown, 
drab, pink, or red. The red and brown sandstones of 
New Jersey are-much used in the finer homes of New 
York, while many of our larger public buildings are 
made of the Berea sandstone from northern Ohio, which 
is almost white. Nearly every locality has its own sand- 
stones, and we have many cities which are largely built 
of them. 
Another building stone which we all know well is slate. 
We have all used slates and slate pencils, and many of us 
sleep under slate roofs and have slate mantels in our own 
homes. This stone is composed of a clay which has so 
hardened throughout the ages that it lies in a series of thin 
planes one above the other, and can be split off in great 
sheets. We have extensive slate quarries in Maine, Ver- 
  In an Ohio sandstone quarry.

mont, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Georgia, as 
well as in other states. 
In mining slate the stone is cut by machinery and taken 
out in blocks. It is then split into sheets of the thick- 
ness desired. The roofing slates are cut from thin sheets, and 
laid on like shingles. The slate used for table tops and 
mantels is often two or more inches in thickness. School 
slates are thin sheets ground and cut by steel saws, ten 
inches in diameter, which go round at the rate of two 
thousand revolutions a minute. After this the slates are 
smoothed by machinery or hand, and then dyed. The dye 
soaks into the slate, and makes its color uniform. 
Next to granite, limestone is the most durable of all 
building stones, and it is about the most used. It consists 
of carbonate of lime with various impurities which give 
it its color; so that it is found in all shades and tints from 
white to blue, green, yellow, pink, red, and black. It is of 
many varieties, from the coarse stones used for paving to 
the pure white marble from which statues are cut, or the 
alabaster or onyx of our clocks, vases, table tops, and man- 
tels. Limestone is also burned to make lime.. It is used 
in the smelting of iron and lead and in glass manufacture, 
so that you see in one form or another it hasa great deal 
to do with our homes. 
Among the most beautiful of the limestones are the 
marbles. These are fine crystals so combined that in its 
purest form the white stone will sparkle and flash in the 
raysof thesun. Marbles are of different colors, made so by 
the other substances mixed with the lime. We find them 
pink, red, yellow, or brown, and often drab, green, and black. 
The same stone may have numerous colors running in veins
-P-A-G-E-115

and otherwise through it, and we have some localities where 
there are beautiful marbles of many hues. This is espe- 
cially true of those from Tennessee and Georgia, while 
those of Vermont range from snow-white to green or dark 
blue. 
Some of the finest and purest marble ever discovered 
came from the Greek island of Paros. It was from that 
stone that the ancient Greeks made their most beautiful 
statues. The marble of the Parthenon came from Mount 
Pentelikon not far from Athens, and a large part of that 
employed in the Forum and the palaces at Rome was 
from the quarries of Carrara, which have been mined for 
thousands of years. The emperor Cesar Augustus said 
it was due to them that he was able to transform Imperial 
Rome from a city of brick to a city of marble. 
The Carrara marble mines lie on the slopes of the Apen- 
nine Mountains. They are close to the town of Carrara, 
and five miles from the little port of Avenza on the Medi- 
terranean Sea. They are situated near the railroad be- 
tween Pisa and Florence, and can be easily reached. 
Comfortable steamers leave New York every week for 
Gibraltar, Genoa, and Naples, and from the two latter 
ports we can easily get to Carrara by rail, or by a small 
coasting steamer can land at Avenza. We shall do the 
latter. As we step out upon the wharf, we see many 
boats taking on marble, and long teams of horned oxen, 
bringing great loads of the white stone down to the ships. 
The marble is in blocks of all weights from forty tons 
downward, and it glistens in the sunlight as it lies on the 
quays. 
We wind our way in and out among such blocks as we

go to the station, and our journey to Carrara is through a 
country of marble. The railroad track is ballasted with it, 
and the train now and then passes through tunnels cut out 
of the white rock. On all the sidings are trucks loaded 
with marble and the very streets of Carrara are snow-white 
from the marble 
ground into them, 
while marble dust 
fills the air. 
The town of Car- 
rara has thirty thou- 
sand inhabitants. 
At first sight it 
seems to be one vast 
marble workshop. 
In every street we 
hear the chiseling, 
sawing, and grind- 
ing as the tools cut 
the white stone. 
In this shop they 
are making mantels 
for fireplaces, in that 
they are carving out 
tombstones and statues, and on the other side of the way is 
a building where the sculptors are making the decorations 
for a palace in France. 
We put on dark glasses to shield our eyes from the 
glare all around us, and go out to the hills where the men 
are blasting the rock. The country is all solid marble. 
The quarries extend far up the mountains and there are 
  Quarrying at Carrara.

workings all the way up. The men begin at the foot of a 
hill and blast down the rock, cutting out great amphi- 
theaters. There are several hundred quarries now work- 
ing, and in them about seven thousand men are busy year 
inand year out. The annual product is often two hundred 
thousand tons, and this is carried to all parts of the civilized 
world where the finest and purest of stone is required. 
The men work carefully. They understand just. what 
holes to drill, and where to insert the dynamite to break 
off the marble in pieces of the right shape. They know 
how to lower the blocks, using ropes as big around as our 
ankles in moving the stones down the mountains on sleds 
of beech wood. When they get to the bottom the marble 
is raised by jackscrews to the wagons or trucks, and carried 
away by engines or oxen to Carrara or Avenza. 
But suppose we return to the United States and see our 
own quarries. We use something like twenty-five million 
dollars worth of marble a year, and almost the whole of it is 
produced in different parts of our country. More than half 
comes from Vermont. There are large marble quarries 
near Rutland where the stone is got out by machinery, and 
handled much better than in the mines of Carrara. The 
chief quarries there are under what was once a hilly sheep 
pasture and a swamp which adjoined it. The land was for- 
merly worth so little that it was refused as séclitity, for a 
few hundred dollars; and in 1836, when William Barnes 
offered an old horse valued at seventy-five dollars for, it, 
the owner was glad to sell. Barnes had noticed the marble 
rock jutting out of the earth, and he bought the place with 
the idea of burning it to make lime. He started his kiln; 
but soon after began to manufacture tombstones of marble,

and thus unearthed this treasure vault of beautiful stone. 
In time Rutland became a great marble quarry, and the 
stone mined there and in other parts of Vermont now 
annually sells for several millions of dollars. 
In the quarries of Proctor, drills have been sunk to a 
depth of two hundred feet through this solid white lime-

stone, and tens of thousands of tons of marble are annually 
mined. The water power of Otter Creek is used to gener- 
ate the electricity which runs the machinery for sawing and

market. The blocks are moved about by electric cranes, 
and by the same power are sawed into slabs of the shapes 
and sizes required. The cranes lift the marble as though 
it were feathers, a thirty-ton block being carried hither and

It is interesting to see how the sawing and cutting are 
done. A machine called a channeler is used. This con- 
sists of a row of long chisels so set in a framework that 
they move up and down as they go over the face of the mar- 
ble ledge, cutting deep into the rock. After that cross chan- 
nels are cut. Then wedges are carefully driven into these 
cuts, and the block splits apart without otherwise breaking. 
In preparing the stone for the market itis cut into slabs and 
other shapes by sand 
saws, which are blades 
of soft iron without teeth, 
upon which a stream of 
water mixed with sand is 
poured. The sand does

the stone asitrolls over it, 
pressed down by the saw. 
This method of cutting 
marble was known to the 
ancients, but its use in 
our American quarries 
came from the invention 
of Isaac Markham,.a 
boy of ten years, who 
saw the marble workers 
grinding or smoothing 
their slabs with water and sand, which they rubbed over 
them with flat stones held in the hand. Young Markham 
made a model of narrow strips of steel so fixed in a

it came the machine

ries the sto; re forced

they lie by plugs and 
feathers. Is it not 
strange to think of feath- 
ers being used to split 
apart these hard stones? 
Yes, but not so much 
so when you understand 
just what the quarryman 
calls: “feathers.” By 
this he means wedges 
which are flat on one 
side and half round on 
the other, the plug being 
another wedge with 
plane faces. In splitting the stone, round holes are drilled 
along the line where the breaking place is desired, and

in each of these holes are placed a plug and two feathers. 
The round sides of the feathers with the sharp end of the 
plug or wedge between them just fit the holes, and as the 
plug is driven down it forces the feathers apart, exerting 
an intense pressure. At the same time the other holes are 
similarly treated, the combined force being so great that’ 
the hard rock breaks away.

Some of our largest buildings have walls of marble and 
some have marble staircases and halls where the stones 
are beautifully carved. This is especially so in the Con- 
gressional Library at Washington, one of the most beauti- 
ful structures of modern times.

AND PLASTER 
HE building stones we have so far seen are those made 
by nature, working throughout the ages. Some of 
them, such as the sandstones, are composed of grains of 
sand similar to that of the seashore, glued or cemented 
together by other materials and by pressure transformed 
into rock. The marbles are of white crystals often col- 
ored by the cementing materials, the sandstones receiving 
their colors in the same way. 
All such stones formed by nature have to be cut into 
the shapes and sizes desired for building, and there are 
many places in our houses in which it is difficult to use 
them. For this reason man early began to look about for 
something which would take the place of stone. He found 
one substitute in clay, of which he made bricks, burning 
them so that they became as hard as stone, and another in 
concrete, which is really an artificial stone made by man. 
By studying and experimenting it was discovered that a 
cement could be formed, which, if mixed with water and 
poured over grains of sand, stones, and other materials, 
would, as it dried and hardened, bind them together almost 
as strongly as the cementing materials of nature bind the
-P-A-G-E-123
ARTIFICIAL STONE 123 
grains of sand in the sandstones. This cement, in many 
parts of Europe, is known as Roman cement because the 
Romans used something like it in their building construc- 
tion. In our country it goes by the name of Portland 
cement or hydraulic cement because it is one of the rock 
cements which will harden to stone under water. There 
  Concrete house under construction, 
are other hydraulic cements, but the Portland cement is 
most commonly used in making concrete or artificial stone. 
This Portland cement consists of rock containing lime- 
stone and clay, or marl and clay, which is ground so 
fine by means of machinery that the grains of dust thus 
made will pass through a sieve which has ten thousand 
holes in each square inch of its surface. When the proper 
rock has been found it is blasted or dug out, and then re- 
duced to a powder. The mixture is run into driers, which
-P-A-G-E-124

are long cylinders of steel from six to eight feet in diame- 
ter. _ They are lined with fire brick and are heated red hot. 
They are turned around by machinery, and are so inclined 
that, as they turn, the cement mixture gradually rolls down 
over the hot brick until all the moisture has been removed 
from it. It is now again ground, the work being so care- 
fully done that the materials of which the powder is com- 
posed are of just the proper proportions. 
In making concrete this powder is mixed as sand and 
broken stones, and water is poured over it. The mass is 
turned over and over by machinery or by hand until every 
grain of the sand and evéry fragment of stone are covered 
with a film of the cement paste. The whole is now packed 
together in blocks or molds of the shapes desired, and 
when it hardens it has all the qualities of stone made by 
nature. It is in fact stone cemented together by man. 
It is of such stone that a great deal of our modern build- 
ing is done. Of it foundations are made, great columns 
erected, and the pillars w ich support our mightiest bridges 
are built. The streets of many of our cities are paved with 
it and our concrete floors,if they were all brought together, 
would cover thousands of acres. The cement employed is 
in such demand that millions of barrels are annually sold 
and its use. is rapidly increasing from year to year. In- 
deed, some of our new homes are now being built of con- 
crete throughout, and not a few of them have walls of solid 
concrete. Ornamental work of this material is largely 
used, the buildings so finished looking as though they were 
decorated with stone carvings. 
Another form of artificial stone is the mortar used to 
unite brickwork and other masonry. This may be com-

posed of certain amounts of sand and lime mixed with- 
water in such a way that it can be spread over the stones or 
thrown in between them; or it may be of sand and Port-

form of lime. The lime-and-sand mortar is not so hard as

sandstone and is less durable. Cement mortar is, if prop- 
erly made, equal to stone; whereas plaster is much softer 
and is used chiefly in fine work and in places not exposed 
to the weather. 
Mortars and rock cements of various kinds have been 
used for building as far back as man can remember. The 
huge blocks on the outside of the Great Pyramid were 
laid in a mixture which contained gypsum or plaster of 
Paris, and the Colosseum was largely of concrete,
-P-A-G-E-126
    126 ARTIFICIAL STONE 
As to plaster of Paris or burnt gypsum this was a part 
of most of the mortars used by the ancients. Later on it 
was employed in Europe, and a curious story is told in 
connection with the vast beds of gypsum which lie not far 
from Paris as to how a Frenchman discovered its value as 
a cementing material. One night a shepherd of that 
region cooked his supper upon a fireplace, which he made 
out in the open, of blocks from these gypsum beds, mixed 
with the other rocks lying about. His fire burned the 
gypsum to plaster of Paris, and, as he was about to leave, a 
rain came on, so wetting the plaster that it melted and 
cemented together the other rocks of the fireplace. In 
this way gypsum was found to be valuable, and the Paris 
deposits are now mined, roasted, and ground for shipment 
all over Europe. They are largely employed in cements, 
and in making plaster casts, including statuary of all 
kinds, and also in decorating the interiors of buildings. 
In burning gypsum rock to make plaster of Paris, the 
furnace is made of the blocks as they come from the 
quarry, the fuel being put in while the furnace is building. 
Wood, coal, or coke may be used, the smoke going off 
through passages made for the purpose. The roasting 
lasts for ten hours, after which the burned pile of rocks 
cools for five or six days, when it is ready to fall into 
powder. It is sometimes beaten fine on the ground, and 
sometimes run through steel mills which grind it to plaster 
of the fineness required. 
Excellent gypsum is now found in many places. France 
produces the most, but a great deal is mined in the United 
States, and especially in Texas, Michigan, New York, and 
Towa. =

“And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech. 
“And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they 
found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. 
“ And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn 
them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they 
for mortar.” 
E have all read the story of the Tower of Babel, of 
which these verses from the Bible are the beginning. 
It was started by the Sons of Noah and it is related that 
they expected to build it up to Heaven, when they were 
suddenly stopped by the confusion of tongues. You may 
read all about it in the Book of Genesis. 
That was more than four thousand years ago, and we 
thus see that man had even then learned how to use bricks 
of burnt clay as a building material. The walls of the 
great city of Babylon which stood on the Euphrates not 
far from the site of this Tower were made by some of the 
descendants of these builders. Herodotus, the oldest 
Greek historian, tells us that they were composed of the 
clay dug from the trenches outside, and that they were 
burnt bricks. He says that the walls were fifty-five miles 
long, three hundred and forty feet high, and eighty-five feet 
in thickness, inclosing a city of wide streets with houses of 
three or four stories and many temples and palaces. 
For centuries Babylon was the greatest city of the 
world. It was the capital of King Nebuchadnezzar, who 
cast the three Hebrews into the fiery furnace and who 
afterwards went mad and ate grass. Its doom was fore- 
told by the handwriting on the wall during the days of

Belshazzar, who succeeded Nebuchadnezzar. A little after 
that the city was conquered by Cyrus the Persian and 
Xerxes robbed the temples of their golden statues and 
treasures. It gradually fell into ruins, and became buried 
from sight by the dust and dirt of the ages. 
Within recent times, however, men have dug down 
under the soil and found some of the bricks and other 
materials which once formed a part of the city. Many of 
the bricks were glazed in the burning and their colors are 
red, yellow, and blue; they are as bright as when they 
were made. Some of the burnt ones are thirteen inches 
square and three inches thick, or more than six times as 
large as the common red brick of our buildings. The 
Babylon bricks, used for the corners of the walls, were tri- 
angular in shape, and wedge-shaped bricks were employed 
for the arches. Some of those found have the signature 
of Nebuchadnezzar stamped on them, and from the marks 
on others we can tell the dates of many of the temples and 
palaces of that great city. The bricks were laid up in clay 
mud, lime mortar, and bitumen, and some in hot asphalt. 
Only the outside of the walls was composed of them, the 
interior being filled with sun-dried brick consisting of wet 
clay kneaded together with finely chopped straw. 
Bricks made of sun-dried clay were probably employed 
for building long before man learned how to burn bricks. 
Going back to the Bible we find that the Israelites were 
forced to make such bricks in the days of Pharaoh. In 
the first chapter of Exodus we read :— 
“And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor: 
“ And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage in mortar, and 
in brick, and in all manner of service in the field.”
-P-A-G-E-129
  
  BRICK STRUCTURES: OF ANTIQUITY 129 
_A little farther on it is related how Pharaoh required 
them to gather their own straw from the fields, and not- 
withstanding this to make as many bricks a day as when 
the straw was furnished them. One passage is : — 
“Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick as hereto- 
fore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. 
“ And the tale [number] of the bricks which they did make heretofore, 
ye shall lay upon them.” 
The only brick material in Egypt is the mud of the 
Nile; and the Israelites used this mud, mixing it with 
straw and turning it 
out in molds or shap- 
ing it up with their 
hands in much the 
same way as bricks 
are made in Egypt 
to-day. The houses 
of the common 
people are still com- 
posed of such ma- 
terials, and should 
we go to Egypt we 
might find here and 
there along the Val- 
ley of the Nile shallow pits filled with mud through which 
water buffaloes are being driven back and forth. Some 
straw is thrown into the mud, and after a time this goes 
through it so that when it is taken out and shaped in the 
molds, the straw aids in holding the mud together. The 
bricks are put out in the sun to dry, and are then laid up in 
mud mortar.

Similar brickmaking goes on in many of the oases of 
the Sahara, in Persia and Arabia, in India, and in other 
parts of the globe where the rains are not frequent and 
building materials are scarce. We find houses of sun- 
dried bricks in Mexico made of adobe, and the remains 
of adobe houses still exist in Colorado, Arizona, New 
Mexico, and California which are centuries old. Some 
of them are more than three hundred years old, and 
nevertheless are still used. 
But suppose we cross the Pacific Ocean and take a look 
at some of the brick buildings of China. Out in the coun- 
try we shall find huts of sun-dried mud, and in the cities 
vast numbers of buildings made of bluish-gray bricks, be- 
ing roofed with tiles of the same material. Almost all of 
the cities are surrounded by brick walls. Peking has a 
wall which is forty feet high. It has towers at the corners 
and here and there along the great structure; and all are 
composed of brick. Standing upon this wall we look over 
a city containing more than a million people, the most 
of whom live in brick houses; and off at one side, inside 
other brick walls, are the palaces of the Emperor and his 
family, the roofs of which are of yellow tiles, as smooth as 
china, which shine like gold under the sun. 
From Peking we take the railroad which goes northward 
through the Nankow Pass into Mongolia to see the Great 
Wall of China. After a few hours’ ride we come to a 
mighty wall made of these same blue bricks, only of a larger 
size. The wall is as high as a three-story house and twice 
as wide as the ordinary city sidewalk. We see it climbing 
the mountains and going down into the valleys, extending 
on and on as far as our eyes can reach. It begins at the

sea and runs over mountain and plain along the border of 
North China for a distance greater than from New York to 
the Mississippi River. It was put up as a defense against 
the savage people who lived on the other side of it, some parts 
having been built 
about two hundred 
years before Christ 
came. 
The Great Wall is 
a mass of earth and 
stone mixed to- 
gether, and faced on 
each side with gray 
or slatecolored 
brick, the material 
between being so 
packed that the 
whole is in most 
places as solid as 
stone. We climb to 
the top of the wall 
and, walking along 
it, find a place where 
the mortar has crum- 
bled away and the 
bricks have come loose. I lift one of the bricks. It weighs 
twenty pounds, or about as much as some of our baby sis- 
ters; and measuring it we find that it is fifteen inches 
long, seven inches wide, and over three inches thick. The 
greater part of the wall is made of such bricks and it is 
said that they were often burned at clay beds miles away 
  “T lift one of the bricks.”

and carried on the backs of sheep, goats, and donkeys up 
the hills to the masons on the wall. 
Going on with our journey, we at last come to Italy, a 
country where bricks were made ages ago. They were in 
use in old Rome and the ruins of that city still contain many 
thin bricks of red clay. If we would see these bricks in 
the buildings we can do so best by going to Naples and 
out to Pompeii. We are now right under the volcano of 
Vesuvius, out of whose top the vapor is rising in clouds 
from the brimstone fires which are boiling and seething 
within. It is more than nineteen centuries since the little 
city in which we are standing was as alive as any of our 
towns of today. The carpenters, stone cutters, and 
masons were working away. New houses were building, 
and the people were living in comfortable homes of brick, 
stone, and marble. Chariots drawn by horses were going 
on the trot through the stone-paved streets, the wheels 
running in ruts which are still to be seen. Here and there 
in parts of the city the children were playing and in other 
places they were going to school. The life of a thriving 
town was in active operation, when, all at once, Vesuvius 
burst forth, throwing out streams of molten lava which in 
floods of fire rolled down the sides of the mountain. 
At the same time the air was so filled with ashes that 
the sun became dim, and the people believed an age of 
perpetual night had set in. The ashes fell on Pompeii, 
and continued to fall until it was buried from view. Such 
of the people as could escape did so, but over two thousand 
were buried. The city was so covered that no signs »of 
houses, theaters, temples, or other buildings were left. It 
was so far under the ashes that as time went on its very

existence was forgotten, and it was not until many centu- 
ries later that men began to dig the earth away and find 
what was left. 
Since then a great part of Pompeii has been uncovered, 
and we can now tell just what kind of houses the people of 
that time had and how they were built. We stroll in and

out through the dwellings, finding brick walls here and 
there. Many of the homes were plastered, and upon the 
walls are paintings in the brightest of colors. There are 
bathrooms made of brick, and a brick bakery, in the ovens 
of which were found loaves of bread, when the earth was 
dug away. Some of the finer houses were floored with 
tiles and not a few with mosaic, the vestibule of one having 
the picture of a dog tugging at his rope and trying to get 
loose. Under the picture are the words: “ Cave Canem!” 
meaning, “ Beware of the dog!” 
Crossing from Naples to Algeria in Africa, and making

our way south through that country, we find not far 
from the Desert of Sahara a half-buried city which was 
larger than Pompeii. This was Timgad, a thriving colonial 
town of Imperial Rome, which was deserted, allowed to 
fall into ruins, and 
finally buried by the 
sand and dust of 
the desert until the 
greater part of it 
had disappeared. 
The covering is now 
being taken off and 
we find brick houses 
there much like 
those of Pompeii. 
There are also tem- 
ples and dwell- 
ings made partly of 
marble, a marble 
theater and forum, 
and an enormous 
bathhouse of burnt 
brick. The latter 
covered almost two 
acres, and was 
heated by flues 
which ran under its floors. It had large swimming pools 
and hot and cold plunges, as well as courts where the 
bathers. wrestled and played games of various kinds. We 
sit down on the marble seats running around the hall, and 
try to imagine how the little boys of Timgad enjoyed them-

selves here when Europe was covered with woods and our 
ancestors were living in huts and sleeping on straw. 
It was the Romans who first carried the art of brickmak- 
ing into Germany and Great Britain ; but the people there 
seem to have forgotten it as soon as the Romans left. It 
was not until well along in the Middle Ages that England 
began to build houses of brick, although it is said that a 
few bricks were molded under the direction of Alfred the 
Great. During the reigns of Henry the Eighth and 
Queen Elizabeth, there were many brickyards, and from 
then on the English employed bricks as a building mate- 
rial. They were using them when our country was first 
settled; and some of the richer of the colonists brought 
burnt bricks across the Atlantic Ocean to America and 
built houses of them.

E need not travel from home to find out how 
bricks are made. Our own country uses such vast 
quantities of them that nearly every town has its brick- 
yard. There are more than twelve thousand such factories 
in the United States, and they turn out altogether some- 
thing like twenty-five billion bricks every year. There are 
single yards which make one million a day, and others 
which have machines that will turn out one hundred thou-

shovels and has huge traveling cranes to carry the bricks 
from one place to another. Its brickmaking machinery is 
moved by electricity.

When the bricks come from the tunnels, they are ready 
for burning. This, in the large yards, is done in ovens,

to a red or white heat. The bricks are kept under this 
heat for from a week to ten days, when the fires are with- 
drawn, and they are allowed to cool. 
In other brickyards where the clay is of a different na- 
ture it is first ground and mixed with water. It is then 
pressed into wooden molds, and from them goes on to the 
driers and the kilns. In the smaller brickyards the clay is 
sometimes mixed in a pug mill moved by horse power. It

is then molded by hand in rough wooden molds of the size 
and shape of the brick desired. Such bricks are often 
dried out in sheds and then placed in kilns for firing. 
After ten or fifteen days the fires are allowed to go down, 
and the bricks are ready for the markets. In the ovens 
wood or coal or even oil may be burned. 
At is in much the same way that the terra cotta employed 
for ornamenting our buildings is made, save that the mix- 
ing and burning the clay must be more carefully done. 
In making tiles the clay comes out in thin bands which 
are cut by wires and then pressed into any shape that may 
be desired. Curved roofing tiles are often formed by bend- 
ing the clay by hand over a leather saddle, the nail holes 
being punched in by hand. The tiles which are so beauti- 
fully glazed are taken out when half burned, and dipped 
into a mixture which, when they are fired again, gives the 
beautiful glass colored effects that we see in fine roofing. 
The tiles for mantels, hearths, and for the walls and 
floors of bathrooms are made in much the same way. The 
fronts of buildings are often decorated with tiles. Some 
of the finest of such buildings are in Italy, one of which, 
known as the Hospital of the Innocents, has a decoration 
of round tiles, each of which represents a beautiful baby. 
This design was made by Andrea della Robbia, who was 
alive at the time America was discovered. Much terra 
cotta is now similarly used in ornamenting our public 
buildings, great figures like that of the Witch Doctor on 
the University of Pittsburg being made of it.

more than the clay.

AVE you ever thought what an important part iron has 
in our homes? It forms the basis of the whole build- 
ingindustry. From it are made all kinds of machinery, and 
every sort of hand tool. It gives us the ax and saw of the 
lumberman, the hatchet and plane of the carpenter, and 
the hammer and trowel of the mason. From it come the 
nails and screws which hold our dwellings together, the 
hinges upon which the doors swing back and forth, and the 
locks which close them at night. Many of our homes are 
roofed with sheets of iron, coated with tin or zinc. Some 
of them are plastered on iron lathing, and some have steel 
ceilings and floors. Moreover, the largest of our city
-P-A-G-E-143
  TRON 143 
buildings, as we shall see later, are almost altogether of 
steel. They have a framework of steel, and contain little 
else than things made of that metal, excepting the stone, 
brick, and plaster used as a coating to keep out the weather 
and preserve the iron from rust. 
We warm ourselves over iron stoves, or perhaps over 
iron radiators through which steam or hot water flows from 
an iron boiler on the floor below. Our meals are cooked 
upon iron stoves fed with coal by iron shovels and stirred 
with iron pokers. The water for our baths is made hot by 
such stoves, and in many of our dwellings it is carried 
through iron pipes to a bathtub of iron, coated with a 
white enamel, which makes it look like china. We sleep 
at night upon steel springs, and that we may rest the bet- 
ter screen our windows with iron wire cloth to keep out 
the flies and mosquitoes. 
Can you imagine a world without iron? If we had none 
at all, machinery of all kinds would soon disappear, our oc- 
cupations would change, and all sorts of mechanical labor, 
as we know it, would vanish. We should have to go back 
to hunting with bows and arrows; to plowing with forked 
sticks ; or to grazing sheep and cattle for a livelihood. If 
we wished to travel on land we should have to walk, or 
ride upon horses, donkeys, or mules, or on carts drawn by 
them; and if we went by water, it would be in dugouts, 
canoes, or sailing ships, although it is doubtful whether 
ships could be made. without this metal to put them to- 
gether. Our houses would dwindle to huts roofed with 
thatch or to the other rude shelters dwelt in by half-civi- 
lized peoples. Indeed, it is impossible to conceive how 
poor a world without iron would be.

It is, therefore, no wonder that the mining of iron ore 
and the making of iron and steel and the things derived 
from them have become about the most important of in- 
dustries. They are more or less carried on in all civilized 
lands; and especially where the people have the ma-

terials and skill needed for them. In this respect the 
United States is ahead of all other countries. We have 
vast iron deposits in many parts of the Union, and also 
the coal and limestone needed to mix with the ore for 
making pig iron. We have more than fourteen thousand 
different establishments, which are engaged upon the 
various manufactures of iron and steel, and our capital
-P-A-G-E-145
  
IRON 145 
employed in such industries amounts to several billions of 
dollars. We have about one million men who are always 
working upon such manufactures. They are paid every 
year something like five hundred million dollars in wages, 
and their annual product sells for over two billion dollars. 
We may appreciate these amounts better when we con- 
sider that the money paid for wages is enough to give 
each man, woman, and child in the United States a pres- 
ent of five dollars every Christmas; and that if we had 
to buy an equal share of the iron goods made in one 
year we should need twenty dollars apiece to make the 
purchase. 
But before we go to the mines, let us have a little talk 
as to how iron was used in the past. We cannot tell when 
it was discovered; but from Genesis, the first book of the 
Bible, we know that Tubal Cain, who lived several thou- 
sand years before Christ, was not only a worker in iron, 
but that he taught others how to make things of iron and 
brass. All through the Bible iron is mentioned. It was 
used for plows, swords, and chariots; and for tools of va- 
rious kinds, including those employed in house-building. 
We know that the ancient Egyptians had some knowledge 
of the metal, for a piece of iron has been found in the 
Great Pyramid, and Herodotus tells us that iron tools were 
used in making that structure. The Greeks had iron long 
before the Christian era, and the Romans had various tools 
of that metal. During the Middle Ages and especially at 
the time of the Crusades, steel, which as we shall see later 
is only one form of iron, was so well known that lances 
and armor for both men and horses were made of it. The 
warriors went to battle clad in iron and some wore, under

their armor, shirts of fine steel links, so skillfully joined 
that they fitted the body as though knitted together. 
As to Asia, we find that the people there have been ac- 
quainted with iron so long that they cannot tell when it 
first came into use. Near Delhi in Hindustan, I have 
seen one of the oldest of all iron monuments. It is an

iron column which is supposed to have been erected as a 
pillar of victory by some warlike people who fought in 
India over two thousand years ago. It is as big around as 
a flour barrel ; it rises twenty-three feet above the ground 
and is sunk many feet below it. It is in the mosque 
known as the Kutab Minar. 
You may have read of the Porcelain Pagoda which the 
Chinese built during the same century that Columbus dis-

covered America. It was situated at Nanking, near the 
Yangtze River. That tower had a dome of cast iron. The 
structure below the dome was of porcelain bricks as 
smooth as the finest of china. It had eight sides and nine 
stories and it rose to a height nearly half that of the Wash- 
ington Monument. At every one of the stories were little 
metal bells hanging to the rafters, which extended beyond 
the walls in such a way that they tinkled when swayed by 
the wind. The iron dome, plated with gold, could be seen 
for miles up and down the valley of the Yangtze River. 
The‘Porcelain Tower was thrown down at the time of a 
great rebellion and its beautiful bricks have disappeared. 
The iron dome is still in existence, and I photographed it 
during one of my recent visits to China. It is now used 
as a fountain, having been turned upside down and set 
into a foundation of marble. That mass of iron is so large 
that it would cover the biggest haystack, and it might 
make a fine bathtub for an elephant. 
It is interesting to know something about the first use of 
iron in our own country. When our forefathers landed, 
the Indians had no tools or weapons made of this metal, 
and it is probable that they were not acquainted with its 
value. The white men, however, soon began to prospect 
for ores, and as their settlements increased iron deposits 
were discovered here and there not far back from the 
coast. They began to use the iron, and erected little fur- 
naces and smelting works, as wellas rude forges and mills. 
In these they made tools and building materials of various 
kinds, although England forbade them to do so, as she 
wanted them to buy all such things from her. 
After our War of Independence the iron industry rapidly  
-P-A-G-E-148

developed, and in 1810 we produced over six million dol- 
lars’ worth of iron of various kinds, of which about one 
third came from Pennsylvania. At the same time we 
began to make steel, and from then on our production of 
these articles was so rapid that we soon became one of 
the leading iron countries of the world, and within recent 
years have far surpassed any of the others. 
But what is this metal that has so much to do with our 
shelter, and with almost everything that we make or use? 
Tron ore exists in many minerals and rocks, and sometimes 
gives a red or yellow color to the soil. The earth washings 
often contain so much iron that they discolor the streams. 
The water takes up small particles of the ore just as it 
takes up salt or sugar, and as it goes on through the 
earth it drops some here and there. It is from such 
droppings that the ‘iron deposits which are mined have 
been formed.
-P-A-G-E-149
  
IRON 149 
As to the metal itself we shall have no trouble in finding 
good specimens of it. Itis kept in every hardware store 
or blacksmith shop in the shape of things made of cast 
iron, wrought iron, and steel. Each of these is composed 
chiefly of iron but all differ in many ways, according to 
the treatment the metal receives after it is taken out of 
the ore. Cast iron is hard, and breaks easily. It can be 
melted but not bent, forged, or welded. A broken stove 
lid or any other casting will show us its nature. Wrought 
iron is comparatively soft, and it can be twisted and bent 
again and again without breaking. It may be welded and 
pounded or-forged, but it will not melt except under great 
heat. This is the character of the horseshoe which the 
smith shapes so that it will just fit the hoof, or of soft 
wrought iron wire, which bends so easily that one can 
tie it into a knot. Steel can also be welded and forged. 
Moreover, it can be melted, and, by tempering, can be 
made hard or soft as desired; it can be made so hard that 
it will cut through 
wrought iron with 
ease. 
From cast iron, 
wrought iron, and 
steel, and combina- 
tions of them, tools, 
machinery, and build- 
ing materials are 
made. They all come

HE first of our journeys will be to see the ore in the 
mines. Where shall we go? We have beds of iron 
ore scattered throughout the Union, and the mineral exists 
to a greater or less extent in all of the states. It is com- 
mercially mined in 
twenty-six states 
and territories; and 
we have some re-   
gions where it is 
found in such abun- 
dance that thou- 
sands of men are 
kept busy taking it 
out of the earth and 
loading the cars and 
ships which carry it 
to the smelters. 
The richest and 
most extensive of 
these deposits lie 
around the southern 
and western sides of 
Lake Superior, in 
Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. They’ are in five 
little ranges of mountains from fifteen to one hundred

  MINING IRON h I51r 
miles back from the lake and so high above it that the ore 
can be taken by gravity down to the vessels. For this 
purpose railroads have been built, and the ore cars from 
the mines are carried out upon trestle works, connected 
with which are huge bins or pockets into which the ore 
is dropped. These pockets are high above the decks 
of the ships as they anchor for loading, and by opening 
them the ore falls through chutes right into the holds. L fv 
  The steam shovel is really a great dipper. 
Some of the ore about Lake Superior lies near the sur- 
face, being covered only with a thin skin of earth and rock. 
In such places the earth is taken off by steam shovels, and 
hauled away on the cars. The ore itself is then broken 
and loosened by blasting, and great shovels do the loading. 
This is open pit mining, and it is aninteresting sight. The 
steam shovel is really a great steel dipper or scoop fastened 
to a long arm or handle attached to a steam engine on 
wheels. The dipper is about as big around as a hogshead.
-P-A-G-E-152
  152 ‘ MINING IRON 
V It has big steel teeth on one side of its rim which cut into 
the ore, and its bottom is so arranged that it can be dropped, 
allowing the contents to fall out. The engine raises and 
lowers and moves the shovel about as the engineer wills. 
The engineer pulls a lever and the great teeth go down 
into the ore, taking a mouthful of five tons at one bite. 
Another lever is pulled and the arm rises and carries the 
load around until it hangs over the car on the track. A 
third motion and the bottom or underjaw of the shovel 
drops, and the ore falls into the car. The work is so rapid 
that one shovel can do as much as several hundred men, 
laboring without it, and a car of fifty tons can be loaded 
within a very few minutes. A single shovel sometimes 
loads two thousand tons in one day. 
Different methods must be employed for ore which lies 
far underground. In such mines shafts or pits are sunk 
through the earth to the ore beds, and tunnels are dug 
and blasted out into them. The miners take up the ore 
and load it upon little steel cars which are carried to the 
surface on elevators or by wire ropes and dumped into 
other cars which take it down to the steamer. The finest 
of machinery is employed in such mines. They are 
lighted by electricity, and compressed air and steam work 
the pumps, drills, and hoists. 
The transportation of the ore from the mines down the 
lakes to the places where it is turned into iron and steel is 
another great industry. It employs so many vessels, dur- 
ing the eight warmer months when the lakes are not 
frozen, that the tonnage they carry in that time is greater 
than that which comes into any ocean port of the world in 
a whole year,

Ye vessels are built especially for the traffic, and some 
are of great size. To give an idea of their loads I may 
say that if you should fill a business street fifty feet wide, 
for four hundred feet, or almost one block, up to the tops 
of the second story windows with solid ore, it could not 
hold more than one big steamer’s cargo. Some of the 
ships take twelve thousand tons at a time, and altogether 
the amount carried down in one season often weighs

twenty or more million tons. Of this about one fourth 
goes through Lake Michigan to Chicago and Milwaukee, 
and most of the remainder to the ports of Lake Erie, or 
to places in the interior where the furnaces and smelting 
works are. 
But why is the ore taken such long distances before it is 
smelted? One would think it would be cheaper to make 
the iron right at the mines. It might be so if nothing more 
than the ore were needed in the manufacture of iron. It 
is necessary, however, to have two other ingredients to mix
-P-A-G-E-154
    154 MINING IRON 
with the ore in the furnaces in order to get the iron out of 
the ore. These are coal and limestone. -Now there are 
no great.coal beds near the Lake Superior mines, and it 
has been found cheaper to carry the iron down the lakes 
to the coal than to carry the coal to the iron. There are 
great coal deposits in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and 
Ohio, and plenty’ of limestone as well, so that in those 
states the smelting can be donecheaply. Therefore large 
smelting and iron manufacturing industries have grown up 
in Cleveland, Pittsburg, and at other cities which are 
within easy reach of the coal and limestone. For similar 
reasons Milwaukee and Chicago have large smelting works. 
We have, however, some places which have extensive 
deposits of iron, with coal and limestone hard by. Such, 
for instance, are the conditions about Birmingham, Ala- 
bama, where great smelters have been built for reducing 
the ore. The iron, there, lies close to the surface of the 
earth, and is taken out through tunnels which are driven 
into the sides of the mountains. : 
Suppose we enter one of the mines. There is a railroad 
running down into it, and we get on the car with a group 
of sooty miners going to work. As we step out at one 
of the levels our guide hands us candles, and shows us the . 
bed or vein of ore they are mining. It is a sandwich of 
gray iron stone between walls of slate and other rock. 
It ranges in width from eight to twenty-four feet, and 
slants as it goes downward. 
As we move along we hear the boom, boom, boom of 
the blasting powder. The miners are drilling holes in the 
rock, and putting in dynamite sticks, to which long fuses 
are fastened. As they light the fuses the men warn us
-P-A-G-E-155
ee ee me Te nee en ee on ee 
MINING IRON 155 
to run, and we barely reach a safe place before an explo- 
sion occurs. The earth shakes and the air so quivers that 
it blows out our candles. Returning we find that a great 
mass of ore has been loosened and broken in pieces. It 
will now be loaded on the cars, and in a short time will be 
on its way to the surface. , 
But before leaving the mine let us take a look at the 
ore. It is sometimes called iron stone, and seems just 
like stone save that it is heavier than any rock we have 
handled before. It shines where it has been broken and is 
of asilver-gray color. In other mines the ore is red, brown, 
or of a yellowish hue. 
In some of the iron deposits the ore lies in the shape of 
nuggets or lumps, and in others in the form of a powder or 
in beds of black sand. We might collect all the varieties 
together, and if we knew nothing about the processes of 
getting the iron out of the ore we could not use it for 
building. It is true we might be able to pile lumps of the 
iron stone one on top of another, and by using mortar or   
cement put them together in walls, or we perhaps might 
mix the black sand with cement in making concrete, but 
otherwise we could do nothing. 
Iron is never pure as it lies in the earth, although in 
Greenland a ledge of almost pure volcanic iron is known 
to exist, and some of the meteors which have fallen upon 
our planet are of iron and nickel. The iron from the 
mines is always mixed with rocks and other minerals, and 
often to such an extent that it would cost too much to 
extract it. It is only through the machinery and _pro- 
cesses of taking the metal out of the ore, which man has 
discovered, that iron has become of value to us.

E have left the mines and are about to visit the 
great smelting works where the metal is taken out 
of the ore and reduced to pig iron. On all sides of us 
are huge furnaces, great black pipes of iron lined with fire 
brick. They rise upward for a hundred or more feet and 
where hottest are surrounded by chambers through which 
cold water flows. They have machinery for hoisting and 
filling them, on their sides and their tops. Connected with 
each furnace are gigantic stoves through which the blast 
of air passes before it is blown into the furnace to increase 
the heat of the coke burning within. There are also tall 
smokestacks, almost kissing the clouds, which furnish the 
draft; and shedlike buildings through which the blazing 
stream of molten iron flows as it comes out to be molded 
to pigs. 
All about the furnaces are huge heaps of ore, limestone, 
and coke. The coke has come from coal which has for 
days been so roasted in ovens that the gases and other 
impurities have been cooked out of it, and it is now of the 
right nature to furnish the intense heat needed for smelt- 
ing. Coke is much lighter than coal. We can find some 
at any gas works, the gas having been taken out of the 
coal that it might be used for lighting our houses. 
As we look at the furnaces we hear the din of machinery. 
Cars and other conveyers are traveling to the tops of each 
huge pipe and dropping their loads into its mouth. They 
are taking up masses of the iron ore, limestone, and coke, 5 
and letting them fall so that they lie in the furnace one on 
top of another. The men know just how much of each to
-P-A-G-E-157
  
IN THE FURNACES AND ROLLING MILLS 157 
use, and just how all should be fed. Additional supplies 
are put in every few moments, so that about six hundred 
tons of these materials are consumed every four hours. 
In this time one hundred tons or more of pig or cast iron 
are made, the larger furnaces often producing as much as 
six hundred tons in one day. 
The furnace is not allowed to grow cool from the time it 
is lighted. The 
great heat is main- 
tained day and night 
all the year through, 
and running water 
is kept flowing 
through the hollow 
chambers about it 
to prevent the heat 
from melting the 
walls. The tem- 
perature is so high 
that the iron ore and 
limestone soon melt 
into a fiery molasses- 
like mixture, and the whole mass turns to a fluid, which blazes 
and seethes and boils as the hot blast rushes through it. 
After a short time gravitation begins to pull the different 
elements of the liquid apart. The iron is the heaviest, 
and gradually it sinks to the bottom, while the other ma- 
terials, comprising the limestone and everything which 
is not iron, floatabove. By and by the iron has all settled 
in the lowest part of the furnace, and the slag, which is 
the name given to the other materials, lies on top. 
  Tapping a furnace, 
   
-P-A-G-E-158
  158 IN THE FURNACES AND ROLLING MILLS 
The furnace is now ready for tapping. The first opening 
is a hole just above the level of the liquid iron, in order 
that the slag may flow off. It comes forth in a blazing 
torrent of yellow, sputtering and sending out sparks, and 
falls down upon the deep sand of the furnace floor, where 
  “See the golden stream of molten metal come out.” 
little ditches have been cut at such a slope that they carry 
it off. 
Now the slag has disappeared, and another hole at the 
bottom of the furnace is opened to let out the iron itself. 
See the golden stream of molten metal come out. It 
blazes and bubbles and sends up sparks like a skyrocket 
as it runs down through the sand. It is so hot that it 
almost blisters our faces, and we step back for fear the

sparks may fall on our feet. It continues to flow, winding 
its way through the channel made for it, until it enters 
a great bed or garden of sand. This is cut up into short 
ditches, each a little more than three feet in length, three 
or four inches wide, and of a little less depth. They are 
the molds for the pigs. After the iron flows into them it 
rapidly cools; it grows darker and darker; and its color 
changes, until it finally turns a blue gray. It hardens as 
it cools, and after a time, when the heat is all gone, the 
pigs are taken out and piled up until needed for the mak- 
ing of steel or for shipment to the markets. 
The manufacture of pig iron is now carried on in many 
parts of the world. It has long been one of the chief in- 
dustries of those countries of Europe which have iron 
deposits, and within recent years extensive smelting works 
have been erected in Japan, China, India, and in some 
other parts of Asia. In the United States, the industry 
is greater than anywhere else, and we are now smelting 
about half of all the pig iron. produced by the world. 
We make so much every year that it has been estimated 
that it would take a train of cars reaching halfway 
around the globe to carry the load, and that if it were all 
made into telephone wire it might form a line from the 
earth to the sun. Tens of thousands of people are engaged 
in the industry, and the annual product has a value of 
several hundred millions of dollars. 
Pig iron is the raw material for making all other iron 
and steel. It is hard and brittle, and it may be used for 
rough castings, such as stoves and other things which are 
to receive hard usage and which can be easily made by 
running the liquid iron into molds. 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
160 IN THE FURNACES AND’ ROLLING MILLS 
As the pig iron comes from the furnaces it contains 
many impurities, which must be taken out before it can be 
made into wrought iron or steel. In these processes, if 
the pig iron has been allowed to cool, it must be melted, 
and so treated as to drive the carbon, silicon, and other 
impurities out. In the great establishment where we are 
now, the cost of melting again is saved by taking the pig 
iron in the molten state to the steel works. In doing this 
the golden stream from the furnace is run out through a 
spout into five brick-lined tanks called ladles. Each ladle 
rests upon car wheels, and the five are joined together in 
a train, which so moves upon a track that they can be 
brought one after another under the spout of the furnace. 
Each ladle holds twenty tons, and the five will contain one 
hundred tons, or the amount of molten pig iron drawn off 
at one time. 
We watch the blazing mixture as it pours into the ladles, 
and follow the train as it moves on, bubbling and boiling, 
over the track through the works. The iron first goes to 
the mixer. This is a huge kettle which holds perhaps two 
hundred tons. Here the ladles, one by one, are lifted by 
great cranes and their contents poured in, the idea being 
to render the whole of a more uniform quality. | 
The metal is now ready to be turned into steel. The- 
old methods of doing this were slow, laborious, and costly. 
To-day, by the inventions of Bessemer and others, they 
have become so rapid and cheap that steel has largely 
taken the place of cast iron. All our tools are of steel, 
our modern buildings are of steel, and steel is employed 
for everything where toughness, strength, and elasticity are 
required. In making it, it is necessary to take the impuri-
-P-A-G-E-161
  IN THE FURNACES AND ROLLING MILLS - 161 
ties out of the iron. In the Bessemer process this is done 
by blowing air through the molten metal in such a way 
that the sulphur, silicon, and other impurities are driven 
off, and some carbon is added, so that as the metal flows 
forth it is steel ready to be cast or forged into any shape 
that may be desired. There are other processes of mak- 
ing steel which yield much the same results, but the 
Bessemer process for a long time produced most of our 
building materials of this nature. 
Now suppose we go to another part of the works and 
see the steel actually made. The molten metal as it comes 
from the mixer is emptied by machinery into an enormous 
iron receptacle shaped like an egg. It is perhaps the big- 
gest egg ever made, and far bigger than the famous roc 
egg described in the Arabian Nights in the adventures of 
Sindbad the Sailor. This egg or converter is made of 
wrought iron, lined with such materials that the molten 
metal cannot affect them; and it is so arranged that when 
the iron has been poured in, a blast of air can be blown 
through it in from one hundred and fifty to two hundred 
different streams. As the air rushes through, the various 
gases and other elements of the melted iron combine and 
the stuff boils and seethes. A mighty volume of blazing 
gas and fire now spurts out of the top or mouth of the con- 
verter, and falls in a shower of sparks and fragments of 
molten slag, making most beautiful fireworks. These fire- 
works continue for about ten minutes, or until all the im- 
purities have been burnt out and only the pure iron 
remains. 
It is now too pure to make steel, and so a little other 
iron containing carbon and manganese is added, and at the

and buildings. Sometimes the steel as it comes from the 
furnace is cast into the forms desired. That used in our 
large buildings is generally rolled out into various shapes. 
It is sawed with steel saws, and is sheared and planed to 
the exact forms required for the structure. 
In making wrought iron the pig iron is put into furnaces 
of a different character from that in which the iron is 
smelted. The wrought iron furnace is usually long and 
low, so that the iron can be stirred about or puddled, 
bringing every bit into contact with the air. As this is 
done, some of the impurities go off in gases. Sometimes 
iron is added which contains the other elements needed; 
and at the close the mass more or less pure is taken out 
in the shape of a ball or lump, or a bloom as it is called. 
This is put under steam hammers and pounded and 
kneaded, or it may be run through rollers until it is of 
the texture required. It is now of such a nature that it 
can be bent this way and that, or rolled out into sheets or 
plates or pounded to shape. 
Indeed, the machines for making Lee handling iron and 
steel are of so many kinds that we cannot describe them. 
If you should go into a large hardware store you might 
find forty or fifty thousand different articles of iron or steel, 
and each would have been made by machinery somewhat 
different from that which produces any of the others. It 
will be enough for us to say that some of the machines are 
so strong that they will knead or roll an iron ingot weigh- 
ing a ton as easily as our cooks knead dough for bread; 
and others are so delicate that they will draw out the steel 
into the hairspring of a watch or the needles our mothers 
use in mending our clothes.

HOW would you like to have a“ museum? 
We can each make one as we go on with 
our travels. We might entitle our collection 
“The Museum of House Building,” and in it 
put all the pictures and other things we can 
find that will illustrate how our homes are made 
and the various materials in them. To do so 
we should go back over our travels, and col- 
lect photographs or drawings of the first shelters 
man used. We might get views of the tent dwellers, and 
of the savage homes of grass, cane, and leaves, and after 
that the log cabins and other houses of our colonial days. 
It will not be hard to find pictures of the Pyramid of 
Cheops in Egypt, the Colosseum at Rome, and of the 
great Chinese Wall or of the buildings now standing in 
the once buried city of Pompeii. 
We can easily collect building materials. Any lumber 
yard will give us pieces of pine, oak, and other woods, and 
the stone-cutting establishments will furnish bits of marble, 
granite, sandstone, and slate. We have brick all around 
us, and many of us live near the materials used for mak- 
ing iron and steel. Coke is to be had at every gas plant, 
and if we have no iron ore near we can get some by writ- 
ing to teachers or others in the towns at the mines. 
For instance, take nails, which form one of the objects 
of our travels to-day. Let each of us collect as many 
kinds as he can and bring them along. I doubt, how- 
ever, whether, all taken together, we can make the 
collection complete. There are more than three hundred

different kinds of nails used in building and they range 
in size from spikes as thick as our fingers and half a foot 
long, down to the little tacks in the carpets. Nails are 
made of many materials, although for the most part they 
are of iron or steel. There are copper nails, brass’ nails, 
and nails of zinc and galvanized iron. The wrought iron 
nail will bend easily, and the same is true of the nails 
with which the blacksmiths fasten horseshoes. Horse- 
shoe nails have big heads and are sharp; they are so soft 
that the ends can be pinched off and pounded down where 
they come through the hoof. Most nails are made by ma- 
chinery, but horseshoe nails are often forged upon anvils 
by hand. 
It would be interesting to know who made the first 
nail. For a long time, we may be sure, men fastened 
their houses together with wooden pins, and to-day many 
of the shelters of uncivilized tribes are pinned together 
with wood or tied into place with fibers of one kind or 
another. This is true of the houses of the poorer of the 
Filipinos, whose roofs of palm leaves are tied or sewed 
to the rafters, the framework being fastened together by 
splints or strips of rattan. Many of the first houses of 
our country were built without iron, wooden pins and 
pegs taking the places of nails and spikes. President 
Jefferson made nails for sale on his estate at Monticello, 
and there were many other small nail factories in Virginia 
and Maryland. 
The ancients used nails of bronze and some made of 
that metal have been dug from the Pompeian ruins. His- 
tory tells us that a century or so ago every large town in 
Europe had its nail makers, who worked at that trade 
 
-P-A-G-E-166

alone. Each man had his own little anvil and forge and 
he cut off and shaped the nails by hand one by one. 
There were certain places near the iron mines in England 
where whole villages did nothing else. Not only the men, 
but the women and children as well, worked at nail- 
making, and little boys and girls heated the thin rods of 
iron red-hot and cut and shaped them into such nails 
as the market required. In Birmingham, England, sixty 
thousand persons were so employed, and they used two 
hundred tons of iron a week. 
At that time nail rods of the right thickness were rolled 
or cut out of wrought iron bars or plates. They were 
sold in bundles to these blacksmiths, who heated the rods 
and cut them into the right lengths for nails. Then 
each length was put into a steel vise with a bit of the 
iron projecting, and a few blows with a hammer flattened 
this end into a head and another blow or so made the nail 
sharp. Tacks and brads were made in much the same 
way. f 
Such methods were still in use everywhere in our colo- 
nial days; but ten years after we declared our Independ- 
ence of England, a Massachusetts man, Ezekiel Reed, 
invented a cut-nail making machine. Soon after this 
other machines were invented and within a few years 
nails were everywhere made by machinery. We have now 
many nail factories, and some of them are making eight 
thousand tons of nails ina month. We have single ma- 
chines which will cut out a thousand nails in one minute 
and others which make round or wire nails of drawn steel 
at the rate of five hundred per minute. ; 
In the manufacture of nails of steel wire, the pig iron is

run through the Bessemer converter and then cast into 
billets about a yard long and four inches square. These 
are heated and drawn through one great pair of rolls after 
another, until they come out in long wire rods only three 
fourths of an inch thick. They now go through ten or more 
other rollers, growing thinner and longer until at last they

  a quarter of an inch thick. During the drawing the rod 
moves faster and faster until when near the end of its jour- 
ney it is traveling at the rate of thirteen hundred and fifty 
feet per minute, or almost fifteen miles an hour. It is 
done rapidly that the steel may not grow too cool during 
the process. 
After this the rod is drawn by powerful machinery 
through holes in stout blocks of cast steel, the holes being 
the exact size of the nail wire required. It is now annealed, 
or heated to take out the strain, and is then ready to be

as wire and coming out in a stream of finished nails at 
the rate of from one hundred and fifty to five hundred 
per minute. The machine cuts the nails from the wire,

until they receive the bright polish of the nails sold in our 
stores. They are now packed up in one hundred pound 
kegs, and shipped off to the markets. 
As we go through the factory we ask what the word 
penny means when used in connection with nails; for the 
men always speak of nails according to size as three
-P-A-G-E-169
  
NAILS AND SCREWS, LOCKS AND HINGES 169 
pennys, four pennys, six pennys and so on up to sixty 
pennys. They show us that the nails grow larger with 
the numbers, and we learn that the penny has come from 
the word pound, and that they were originally called three 
pound, four pound, five pound nails, according as it took

a thousand of the nails to weigh so many pounds. For 
instance, it took one thousand fourpenny nails to weigh 
four pounds, one thousand tenpennys to weigh ten pounds, 
a thousand sixtypennys to weigh sixty pounds, and so on. 
In time the sizes of the nails became fixed, and the actual 
numbers were not counted. 
Another interesting article used largely in fastening our 
houses together is the screw, which is now made of steel 
waa MIB tase 
Machine screws, 
in many different sizes. In such manufacture the wire 
is first drawn, and then cut, headed, and threaded by 
machinery so that it has the spiral point which enables it 
to work its way through the wood. After this the screws 
are polished, and packed up in cardboard boxes for sale. 
But it will be impossible for us to examine every variety 
of iron that goes into our houses. There are so many that 
it would take weeks of travel to study them all. There
-P-A-G-E-170
  170 NAILS AND SCREWS, LOCKS AND HINGES 
are some iron things, however, which are found in every 
house, and among the most important of these are 
hinges and locks. 
The original hinge was probably a 
piece of vine or fiber put through 
holes made in one side of the door to 
tie it to the framework so that it could 
be swung back and forth. Later on 
leather was used in much the same 
way. Doors were also made with 
pivotlike projections at the top and 
bottom, which fitted into holes of the 
framework, and 
they were thus 
moved back and 
forth. An Italian 
cathedral which 
was built in the 
eleventh century 
| has shutters of 
| stone slabs which 
are hung by such 
pivots. During 
the Middle Ages 
many curious 
iron hinges were 
wrought on the 
forge. To-day all 
sorts of hinges are 
cut and cast out of iron and steel, and also from brass and 
other combinations of metals.      
-P-A-G-E-171
  
NAILS AND SCREWS, LOCKS AND HINGES 171 
In our colonial days, when iron was so hard to get, 
many of the log cabins had doors with leather hinges 
Sa ee much like the strap iron hinge of the present 
tacked to the framework. To-day hinges. are 
sold at a little more than the cost of the iron 
which goes into them. They are made by the 
millions, and we can find many kinds for our 
museum if we decide to collect them. 
A more interesting article, however, is the 
lock, which has hundreds of shapes, 
including many curious contrivances 
to puzzle the stranger. The lock is 
intended to keep one’s things safe 
from thieves, and sometimes from 
the gaze of curious persons who 
wish to learn about matters‘ con- 
cerning which they have no busi- 
ness to know. Therefore it must 
be of such a nature that it cannot be easily 
opened, and the more complicated it is the better 
it serves the purpose for which it is made. 
Locks have been used as long as man can 
remember. The Greek poet Homer, who lived 
ages ago, speaks of them; and Pliny, an ancient Roman 
writer, says that keys were invented about seven hundred 
years before Christ. The old-time Egyptians hung their     
-P-A-G-E-172
    172 NAILS AND SCREWS, LOCKS AND HINGES 
doors upon hinges of bronze, and they kept their jewelry in 
bronze caskets fastened by locks. The Romans had bolts 
and locks on their doors, and their money chests and jewel 
caskets were guarded in the same way. Some of their 
locks were so large that the key had to be supported while 
turning it, and others so small that they were mounted as 
finger rings. 
The Chinese have locks which work on the principle of 
the screw, and may be screwed open or shut; and in some 
of their locks a bell rings as the key turns, so that they 
can tell by the sound if anyone is trying to open the door. 
We have locks containing tumblers and springs and 
other contrivances on the inside which make it almost im- 
possible for one who has not the right key to move them. 
We have time locks which cannot be opened except at the 
minute and hour fixed for doing so; and combination locks 
in which one must turn the key this way and that just so 
far and no farther each time. Sometimes the combination 
is composed of figures and sometimes of letters, so that 
one must spell out a word on the dial before the lock will 
spring open. We have also spring locks, sliding door 
locks, night latches, and dead locks in which no knob is 
used, the key alone being required. 
Some locks are arranged so that they can be locked 
from the inside but not from the outside of the door, and 
some in such a way that one key will unlock a whole series 
of locks, but the individual keys will not open any of the 
others. Indeed, locks are now of all sizes and shapes, 
embracing a great variety of curious inventions. In the 
past they were wrought out almost altogether by hand. 
They are now made by machinery. y

TIN AND ZINC 1738 
20. TIN AND ZINC 
O-DAY we are to investigate the use of certain water- 
proof metals. We may call them such, for they are 
used to protect other metals, and especially iron and steel, 
from the weather, much as our rubber coats protect us 
from rain. It is strange to think of putting overcoats on 
such tough, strong, and durable metals as iron and steel 
for fear they may grow sick through wet weather. But 
that is really the case. Iron and steel rust or oxidize when 
exposed to the moisture and air; and, if not protected, 
they will in time become weak and scale off so that they 
will finally fall into pieces. 
It is therefore desirable to have some sort of weather- 
proof clothing to put over them. Now there are several 
metals which air and water do not affect so rapidly as they 
do iron and steel; and these are employed to cover the 
latter. Among the chief of such metals are tin and zinc, 
which we shall examine to-day. 
We use tin for roofing and spouting, and for cups, pails, 
and pans of all kinds. Bathtubs are often lined with tin 
and the canning and certain other industries depend 
largely upon it for the vessels or boxes in which goods are 
kept until sold. There must be a vast deal of the metal, 
must there not? 2 
Indeed, at first thought, one would think this the case, 
but it is not so. There are only a few places where tin has 
been found in large quantities. We shall see where these 
are farther on. All the tin mined on the globe in one year 
is only about one hundred thousand tons, while the iron 
and steel amount to much more than a thousand times
-P-A-G-E-174
  174 TIN AND ZINC 
that. The tin, however, is seldom used except as a coat- 
ing. The metal is such that it can be pounded out into 
sheets so thin that one thousand of them laid one on top 
of another would not be thicker than this book we are 
reading. Tin foil, such as is sometimes wrapped around 
cakes of sweet chocolate, will serve as a specimen of this 
for our house-building museum. Roofing plates are of 
iron with an even thinner coating of tin, and tin cups and 
pans are only iron, tin-plated. We shall learn that zinc is 
used in much the same way. 
But let us take a rapid trip over the world and examine 
the tin ore as it lies in the earth. We shall find it in 
nuggets, grains, and dust, much like the placer gold that 
is washed out of the beds of the streams in some parts of 
our West. It also exists in lodes or veins in rocks, which 
must be pounded to powder to get the tin out. 
Our first journey is on an ocean liner across the Atlantic 
to Wales in Great Britain. We go to Cornwall, where are 
tin mines which have been worked for two or three thou- 
sand years. The early Phoenicians knew of them, and 
both they and the Romans sailed out through the Strait of 
Gibraltar and across to Great Britain for cargoes of tin. 
Much of the Cornwall tin is mixed with copper. It lies in 
faults or breaks in the granite or slate rock, some of the 
veins being no thicker than sheets of paper and others 
many feet thick. In places the tin ore lies in large masses, 
and at one point we are shown a great bowl almost a mile 
in circumference and several hundred feet deep, from which 
about a million tons have been taken. The earth of that 
mine is soft, and much of the ore was washed out. In 
other mines the workings are now half a mile under-
-P-A-G-E-175
  
TIN AND ZINC 175 
ground, comprising miles of tunnels in which pumps are 
kept going to take out the water. The ore when it comes 
to the surface is sorted and ground to a powder. It is 
then washed to remove the earthy materials, and after that 
roasted and smelted and run off into bricks. 
The grains of tin, or stream-tin as they are called, are

much like big grains of gunpowder, whereas, that found 
in the veins looks like silver or lead ore. The smelted 
bricks shine like silver. 
From Cornwall we might cross the English Channel 
and take a run into Saxony and Bohemia, both of which 
produce tin ; or if we had some months to spare we could 
go back over the Atlantic to South America and travel on 
the Amazon to its source high up in the Andes, not far 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  
176 _ TIN AND, ZINC 
from which are large tin deposits. I have visited some 
about Lake Titicaca on the high plateau of Bolivia. 
That region has mountains in which tin, copper, and 
silver lie close together. 
The tin is in veins which range in thickness up to six 
and eight feet and in depth to more than six hundred 
feet. The ore is taken out by the Indians. It is some- 
times carried to the trains or the smelters on the backs of 
llamas, queer little animals which have wool like a sheep 
and necks and heads not unlike a camel. Each Ilama will 
carry only one hundred pounds of ore at a load, and if 
more is put upon him he will lie down and spit a sour, 
biting liquid at any man who tries to force him to move. 
The most important of all the tin mines are in southeast- 
ern Asia. The total annual product of the world, as I have 
said, is about one hundred thousand tons. Of this perhaps 
one twentieth comes from Cornwall and three times as 
much from the Andes. Of the remainder seven thousand 
tons are produced in Australasia, and the balance, which is 
almost seven tenths of the whole, comes from the southern 
end of the Siamese Peninsula near the Strait of Malacca and 
the two little islands of Banka and Billiton lying between 
that Strait and Java. The mines on the peninsula now 
yield more than half of all the tin used. This product is 
known as Straits tin. It is found in grains, beds, and 
veins, and is often so mixed with earth and gravel that it 
can be mined by throwing streams of water against it 
through a hose worked by a pump. The gravel is then 
washed, in which process the heavy tin sinks to the bot- 
tom. It is now gathered up and carried to the furnaces, 
where it is smelted with charcoal and limestone and run
-P-A-G-E-177
TIN AND ZINC 177 
off into pigs or bricks of the size of a pound loaf of bread. 
The same sort of smelting is done in other tin regions. 
As the tin comes fromthe smelters it is mixed with im- 
purities. It often contains arsenic and iron, copper and 
other materials. It must be remelted and run off into re- 
fining basins, where it is stirred with sticks of green wood. 
As the wood moves about through the boiling metal, its 
sap is cooked out in steam, and this aids in separating the 
impurities from the tin. By and by, the other metals, 
inasmuch as they are heavier than the tin, sink to the 
bottom, and the molten liquid above, now almost pure tin, 
is drawn off into molds, where it cools. The tin is now 
known as block tin, and is ready for making tin plate. 
In the meantime the iron must go through many pro- 
cesses before it is ready for its tin overcoat. The pig 
metal has already been smelted, and reduced to the right 
sort of iron for the plates. It has been passed through 
one set of rollers after another until it has reached. the 
size and thickness of the plates to be used, and it has now 
to be so cleaned, smoothed, and polished that the tin will 
spread evenly over its surface. 
In the first place, it must be perfectly clean. We have 
often heard of pickling cucumbers in vinegar. The tin 
makers tell us that they have to pickle the iron before the 
tin is put on. This is to take off the rust and scales. In 
this process the plates are bathed again and again in hot 
sulphuric or hydrochloric acid, being taken out between- 
whiles and washed clean and heated and cooled in just the 
right way to make them of the soft and pliable nature in- 
tended for roofing, or for bending them to the shape of tin 
cups and other such things. They are run through chilled

  178 TIN AND ZINC 
iron rollers, are polished with emery and oil, and then 
scoured with sand until they are white, clean, and bright. 
After they are ready for the tin, each sheet is dropped into 
a pot of melted grease and then taken out and plunged with 
other sheets into a bath of melted tin coated with grease. 
Some of the molten tin sticks to the’iron plate, and the 
plate then receives a second tin bath in which the metal 
is purer. The tin-plated sheets are now wiped off with a 
brush, and put into the washpot. If there is too much tin 
on them, some is removed by giving them a bath of tallow 
and palm oil, the liquid being just hot enough to allow the 
surplus tin torun off. The sheets are next passed through 
troughs containing bran and meal, and are rubbed with 
flannel until they shine like a mirror. They are now ready 
for shipment to the markets. 
Zinc is another waterproof metal largely used to protect 
the iron we employ in our dwellings. Many of our roofs 
are of galvanized iron, and in parts of the world where 
wood is scarce, whole houses, large and small, are com- 
posed of sheets of iron so covered. In making such iron 
the sheets are coated with tin by what is known as the gal- 
vanic process, and are then plunged into a bath of fluid 
zine and certain other chemicals by which the zinc is left 
on the metal. The term “ galvanized iron” is also used for 
iron which has been dipped in a bath of melted zinc, mixed 
with certain chemicals, which cause the zinc to fasten itself 
to the iron. 
Vast quantities of the iron pipes used for plumbing are 
coated with zinc, and the same is true of spouting and 
fixtures of various kinds. If the zinc is put on thickly it 
forms an even safer protection against rust than tin. It
-P-A-G-E-179
  TIN AND ZINC 179 
is largely employed in coating fence wire, and in all iron 
structures where painting is not desirable on account of 
the cost. 
Zinc ore is more common than.tin ore. It looks like 
lead ore and is often mixed with it. It is found in certain 
countries of Europe, and in great masses in Central Africa. 
  View in lead and zinc mine, Kansas. 
It exists in many parts of the United States and especially 
in Kansas, Missouri, and Wisconsin. The center of the 
zinc-mining industry is Joplin, in southwestern Missouri. 
About that city great zinc deposits have been found, and 
more than one hundred million dollars worth taken from 
them. There was no city at Joplin before zinc was dis- 
covered, and that mineral is really the cause of the growth 
of the city. The common term for zinc ore used by the
-P-A-G-E-180
180 LEAD, COPPER, AND BRASS 
miners is “jack,” and so “jack” has built up the city. 
We have all heard of the “ House that Jack Built,” but 
Joplin is the sows that “jack” built.

21.. LEAD, COPPER, AND BRASS 
“Oh that my words . . . were graven with an iron pen and lead in 
the rock forever.” 
HIS sentence comes from the Bible, and it was 
uttered by Job, thousands of years before Christ. It 
shows us that lead was already in use at that time and 
that the people knew much about it. The ancient 
Romans covered the bottoms of their ships with sheet 
lead. which they fastened on with bronze nails. Their 
warriors used leaden bullets which they threw with slings. 
They had lead water pipes in their houses, and they made 
lead paints, which the great ladies used to color their 
cheeks. 
To-day white lead, made by corroding lead in acetic acid, 
is the most common form in which lead is employed. 
Such lead, ground in oil, forms a waterproof coating for 
almost all our frame houses, and it is often employed to 
protect iron from rust. It combines readily with linseed 
oil, and is the basis of some of the best paints which have 
yet been discovered. 
We use lead in its metallic form for water pipes, joints, 
and plumbing of various kinds. In solder it aids in joining 
tin plates together, and it is also employed in the manufac- 
ture of glass. 
Lead is one of the most flexible and durable of metals.
-P-A-G-E-181
  
LEAD, COPPER, AND BRASS 181 
It can be bent or pounded into all sorts of shapes. It does 
not rust, and is therefore valuable in waterworks and their 
fixtures. It can be easily melted; and had we the right 
molds we could pour some lead into them and make toys 
of all kinds. You have heard of Hans Christian Ander- 
sen’s story of the little tin soldier. I am pretty sure, how- 
ever, that soldier was made of lead or had lead in him. 
Some of the verses of our nursery days remind us of one 
of the uses of lead. 
“There was a little boy 
And he had a little gun 
And his bullets were made of lead, lead, lead. 
He shot John Sprig 
Through the middle of his wig 
And knocked it off his head, head, head.” 
Lead is still used for small shot and bullets. Our pioneer 
forefathers made their own bullets, melting the lead in iron 
pans over the open fires, and pouring it into molds, where 
it hardened to shape. 
But where does lead come from? 
We find the ore in different parts of the United States, 
and it is common all over the world. For a long time the 
chief source of supply was Spain, and a great deal came 
also from Great Britain. When our country began to be 
settled, the first mines worked were in Virginia, Connecti- 
cut, and Massachusetts, and from them came some of the 
bullets we used in our wars with the Indians, and also 
with the British. As the pioneers made their way west- 
ward they found richer deposits of lead in the Mississippi 
basin, and especially in Iowa, Illinois, and Wisconsin. 
The city of Dubuque was named after a Frenchman who 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
182 LEAD, COPPER, AND BRASS 
bought lead mines near there from the Indians about 
1780; and long before that, the Indians of Wisconsin, 
Illinois, and Iowa were smelting lead and selling the ore 
to the French traders. The Frenchmen wanted furs, and 
therefore they sold the Indians firearms and taught them 
how to handle the lead and make it into bullets. The In- 
dians smelted the ore in rude furnaces made by digging 
holes in the hills, and they ran the metal off into leaden 
pigs which their squaws carried to the trading posts. After 
a time the ore became so valuable that it was used as money 
in the upper Mississippi basin, the rate of exchange being 
a peck of corn for a peck of ore. 
Lead ore in its most common form usually contains more 
or less other metals. In this form it is known as galena. 
We have two towns in the United States named Galena, 
one in Illinois and another in Kansas, both so called from 
the lead deposits near by. We have towns farther west 
which were also named from mines of this metal about 
them. We have all heard of the city of Leadville, Colo- 
rado. It is situated almost two miles above the level of 
the sea, high up in the Rockies, and is built over veins and 
beds of silver and lead, while great mines producing these 
metals lie all about it. The lead of the Rockies is much 
mixed with silver, and in the smelting both metals are saved. 
In the mines about Joplin a great deal of zinc is mixed 
with the lead. Altogether we produce several hundred 
thousand tons of lead every year, the value of the product 
sometimes amounting to many millions of dollars. 
Another metal largely employed as a building material 
is copper. Great structures are roofed with it, and the 
most beautiful doors of some of our public buildings have

been made of a combination of it and other metals. This 
is so of the huge bronze doors which form the entrance to 
our Capitol at Washington, and of those made by Ghiberti 
in the Baptistry at Florence. These doors have been

bronze stairways; and the Library Building, not far away,

has a bronze fountain in front of it and bronze doors of 
remarkable beauty. 
Copper is found in all articles made of brass, and we fre- 
quently have it in door knobs, and on the spigots and other 
fixtures connected with plumbing. We use it for the wires

which run through our homes to the telephones, and also 
in those which carry the current for the electric lights. 
We have brass beds, copper and brass lamps, and, indeed, 
many beautiful things made of copper and brass. 
In most of these articles the copper is mixed or alloyed 
with other metals. Sometimes the chief sister metal is 
zinc, and the two when melted together form brass. In 
other cases tin is combined with the copper, and in the past 
this alone was called bronze. Now an alloy of copper and 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
LEAD, COPPER, AND BRASS 185 
aluminium is also called bronze, and the distinction between 
brass and bronze is not so sharply made as it was in the 
past. Both metals are now formed by mixtures of copper, 
zinc, tin, and aluminium, different proportions of the vari- 
ous metals being employed for making different things. 
Copper is one of the oldest of metals. Indeed, some 
people think it was the first metal used by man. It lies in 
the earth in ores of different colors, being often mixed with 
rock and various metals. Red oxide of copper is reddish ; 
malachite, which is carbonate of copper, is green; and 
copper pyrites is yellow. 
We have vast quantities of copper. It is found here and 
there throughout the Appalachian Range. There are 
enormous deposits of it about Lake Superior in the 
northern peninsula of Michigan, and we have a great deal 
in Montana, Arizona and other parts of the Rocky Moun- 
tain Highlands where the ore is found in great masses. 
There are also large deposits in Alaska and California. 
Our annual product often amounts to hundreds of mil- 
lions of pounds, and it is worth far more than our product 
of gold and silver. 
Indeed, copper comes next to iron in the value of the 
metals we take from the earth. Our mines are so rich 
that they now yield the greater part of all the copper used 
in the world, although there are large deposits in Canada 
and Mexico, and in South America, Africa, Australasia, 
and Europe. 
About the oldest copper mines known are those of the 
Spanish Peninsula. They have been worked since the 
time of the Romans, and thousands of miners are labor- 
ing in them to-day. The most famous are the Rio Tinto 
   
-P-A-G-E-186
    186 LEAD, COPPER, AND BRASS 
mines, which lie about forty-six miles northwest of the 
city of Seville. They cover a space large enough to 
make fifty farms of one hundred acres each. The Rio 
Tinto ore lies near the surface, and it is dug and blasted 
out and carried on trains to the smelters. There are more 
than sixty miles of railroads in those mines, and thirty 
  
  Casting brass. 
locomotives are kept busy taking out the ore. The copper 
is mixed with iron and sulphur, and it must be smelted in 
order to make the bricks or pigs which constitute the 
metal of commerce. 
An interesting story is told of the discovery of the Calu- 
met and Hecla Copper Mines of the Michigan Peninsula. 
They lie about five miles from the shores of Lake Supe- 
rior, and are among the richest of their kind in the world.
-P-A-G-E-187
LEAD, COPPER, AND BRASS 187 
Many millions of dollars’ worth of ore has already been 
taken from them, and more is mined every year. The ore 
is largely in masses, some of which weigh many tons. 
Almost a half century ago no one knew that copper lay 
there, when one day 
a pig in wandering 
about through the 
woods happened to 
fallintoa hole. He 
tried to root his way 
out, and thereby un- 
covered some of the 
ore andthus brought 
this great treasure 
vault to the eyes of 
man. 
In making brass 
the copper is melted 
and the zinc grad- 
ually added, the two 
metals being so 
treated that they are 
thoroughly mixed, 
after which they can be run out into molds forming aig 
castings desired. 
Brass is soft, and can be easily bent. It is rolled in 
thin sheets, and drawn out into wire. If we would see 
how the rolling is done, we may do so by a flying journey 
to the great works of the Naugatuck valley in Connecticut. 
The Naugatuck River rises in the hills in the northwest- 
ern part of that state and flows rapidly down to the

Housatonic, its mouth being at Derby. Between the 
towns of Derby and Torrington the fall is about six hun- 
dred feet, and this gives a great water power which is used 
by the brass makers. Most of the rolled brass of the 
United States is made there, and thousands of men are 
employed in the business. There are many large mills 
for melting and rolling the metal. They use copper and 
zinc, putting them together in the proper proportions for 
the material desired, and then running the product through 
rolling mills which turn them into plates of just the right 
size. They make sheets of all thicknesses down to some 
for eyelets, so carefully rolled that they do not vary more 
than half the breadth of a hair of your head. 
Some brass has ninety parts of copper and ten parts of 
zinc. This is red brass, and has a copperish tinge. There 
are other combinations which contain sixty parts of copper 
‘and thirty of ‘zinc. This brass is yellow, and looks some- 
what like gold. Bell metal is more than three fourths 
copper, the balance being tin; and gun metal usually con- 
tains one hundred parts of copper to ten parts of tin.

E shall enter fairyland during our travels to-day 
and make the acquaintance of the fairy queen, 
known as glass. She is one of the brightest, gayest, and 
most beautiful of the sprites engaged in house building, 
and one of the kindest to civilized man. She has driven 
the gloom and darkness out of our homes and allowed the 
sun and warmth to stream in. She is a truthful fairy. We

may peep into her face as it shines in our mirrors at any 
hour of the day; and she will tell us whether our hair is 
combed or untidy, whether our faces are dirty or clean, 
and even the state of our minds by the happiness or misery 
shown in the reflection. Queen Glass is also a worker in 
magic. Through her are created the most beautiful of 
objects, from the slipper 
which Cinderella lost 
during her dance with 
the prince, to the cut 
glass we use on our 
tables, and the glass 
beads and brooches 
which shine like dia- 
monds when the light 
strikes them.

true of glass. When bits of glass are first shown to the 
savages of Africa they are considered as jewels, and 
  glass beads are so precious that gold, ostrich feathers, 
and ivory are exchanged for them. I once traveled 
across the Korean Peninsula when that part of the 
world had been but little visited by white men. I had 
with me some mineral waters in glass bottles, and I found 
that the natives cared more for the bottles than for any- 
thing else I could give them. At that time the houses of
-P-A-G-E-190
  190 A TRIP TO FAIRYLAND 
Korea had no glass, and their windows and doors were 
backed with oiled paper, which allowed but little light to 
come in. It was then the same in Japan, where the walls 
of the beautifully built homes are often a latticework over 
which a thin half-transparent paper is pasted. These move 
back and forth in grooves, serving as both walls and doors. 
The outer walls of the house are usually of boards, and 
are so made that they can be shoved back or taken away 
during the daytime, leaving the walls of lattice covered 
with paper to furnish the light. 
The Chinese use paper for glass in many of their stores 
and houses, and both the Chinese and Japanese have 
lanterns of paper and horn. The horn lanterns are 
made by softening the horn and pressing it out so that it 
is almost transparent. In some of the old dwellings of the 
Philippine Islands shells are used for windowpanes, and 
it is said that the Romans had windows of horn. 
Many of the castles of feudal Europe had only slits in 
the walls to admit the light, and even in the Middle Ages 
the houses of the common people were often lighted with 
panes of oiled paper. When our forefathers came to 
America glass was costly, and paper was often used in its 
place, the settlers bringing oiled paper with them for that 
purpose. 
We must not think, however, that glass was not known 
before it came into use as a building material. Man had 
learned how to make it many centuries before that, and 
had used it for bottles, vessels, and beads for ages before 
he tried to put it into skylights, windows, and doors. 
There are pictures of glass bottles in some of the Egyp- 
tian tombs four thousand years old, and on the walls of

one of them is a painting of a man blowing glass. The 
ancient Greeks had glass vessels, and the Phoenicians 
made beads of colored glass and used them in trading. 
But we have not yet learned what glass is. We shall find 
out all about it a little later on when we visit the factories. 
It will be enough here to say that it is made of silica, of 
which the sand of the seashore and other places is mostly 
composed, melted together with soda or potash and lime 
  Roman glass. 
and oxide of lead, the character of the glass depend- 
ing much on the materials used and their treatment. In 
short, we may say that glass is melted sand, for the pro- 
portion of other things in it is small. 
The ancient Romans got their first glass from the 
Phoenicians, and they have left a story as to how the latter 
found that sand could be turned into glass. Pliny, a 
Roman writer, says that the discovery came from some 
Pheenician sailors whose vessel, containing a cargo of 
soda, was cast ashore on the coast of Palestine. The soda 
was in lumps, and when they built a fire on the sand they 
used them to raise their cooking pots above the coals. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  
192 A TRIP TO FAIRYLAND 
heat of the fire melted the soda and sand together and 
formed a rough glass. 
It is doubtful, however, whether this was really the 
origin of the discovery. A heat so slight as a camp fire 
could hardly melt sand; and we know that the Egyptians 
had made glass before that. 
The British Museum has a glass 
vase engraved with the name of 
an Assyrian king who lived long 
before the days of Daniel the 
prophet, and also a blue glass 
amulet which ‘is almost as old as 
the Pyramids. Glass sheets, 
which were probably used for 
mirrors, were found in Pompeii, 
and the Emperor Nero, who 
reigned shortly after that city 
was destroyed, paid two hun- 
dred and fifty thousand dollars 
for two little glass vases. 
Among the most skillful of 
the early glassmakers were the 
people of Venice. They made 
mosaics, wonderful pictures 
composed of bits of colored 
glass fitted together; and they floored and walled some of 
their cathedrals and other buildings with them. They also 
manufactured vessels and other things of glass, having pro- 
cesses the secrets of which it was death to tell a stranger. 
For a long time the glassworkers were not allowed to leave 
Venice, and if they did so men were sent after them with 
  Vase from Pompeii.

instructions to kill them. One such glassworker, named 
Paoli, was tracked to France, where he was found one 
morning stabbed to the heart by a dagger on which was 
written the word “Traitor.” : 
About the time that Columbus started out on the 
voyage during which he discovered America, the street of 
the glassworkers on the island of Murano, near Venice, 
  Venetian glass, 
was a mile long and upon it were sold all sorts of beautiful 
wares which were made nowhere else. Among them were 
beads, bracelets, bottles, vessels, goblets, and mirrors 
backed with an amalgam of tin and quicksilver. The 
Venetians are said to have invented that kind of mirror. 
It is much the same as our mirrors of to-day. 
Fine glass is still made by the Venetians, although the 
secrets of their work have long ago been scattered over 
the world. Some of them were carried to France by 
workmen who escaped, notwithstanding the danger, and

especially by a party of eighteen who went to Paris and 
established a glass factory there. That was just about 
one hundred years before George Washington was inau- 
gurated as our first President. The Paris factory made 
mirrors by blowing the melted glass and bending it out 
into plates, which were silvered. Then a French work- 
man discovered how to cast the molten glass, and for a 
hundred years France was the center of the cast plate- 
glass manufacture. 
In the meantime the Germans and English had learned 
how to make glass of various kinds. The Bohemians had 
invented processes of making cast glass and cut glass, and 
had brought in the art of mirror making from the French. 
The English glassmakers were first taught by men 
imported from Venice and France, and one of them in- 
vented the process of making glass of lead flint, which 
was especially brilliant and hitherto unknown. 
In our own country some glassmakers were brought over 
with Captain John Smith, but there is norecord that they pro- 
duced anything of value. A year after the Pilgrims landed 
at Plymouth some Italians were imported to make glass 
beads for the Indians, and a little later glassworks were 
built at New York, Salem, and Philadelphia. 
Our first really successful glass factory, however, was 
started at Boston about a.p. 1787. Ten years after that 
time, the first one at Pittsburg was built, and now we have 
in different parts of the Union glass factories making all 
sorts of wares. The number all told is four or five hundred 
and their capital is many millions of dollars. Some of the 
factories produce window glass only, others make bottles, 
and others are devoted to cut glass and tableware. “Penn- akin tua:

E each have a pair of magic spectacles this morning. 
They have been furnished by Madame Glass, our 
queen of the fairies; and through them we shall see some 
of the factories in which her wonders are made. We have 
come to Pittsburg by railroad and are now in an enormous 
establishment of many huge buildings filled with furnaces, 
tables, vats, and machinery of various kinds. Overhead is 
a network of pipes, rods, and belts, and below in the floor 
are great pits in which men’ are blowing glass somewhat 
as a child blows soap bubbles. They stand on the edges 
and swing long cylinders of red-hot glass back and forth. 
How hot it is! The buildings have great openings to 
let in the air and huge machines are employed to keep it 
in motion. Nevertheless some of the men are bare to the 
waist, and we feel as though we should like to take off 
our flesh and walk about in our bones. The temperature 
‘required to melt the sand is about 3000° F. or nearly fifteen 
times that of boiling water, and this intense heat is kept up 
inside the melting tanks day after day while the glass 
making goes on. 
We take a look at the furnaces. They are made to with- 
stand the great heat; their walls and roofs are fire brick, 
and the walls are two feet or more thick and bound round 
with iron to keep them in place. The tatins or pots in 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  196 A VISIT TO A GLASS FACTORY 
which the molten masses are fused are of the best of fire 
clay, and the tables upon which some kinds of glass are 
rolled into shape are cast iron. 
But first let us look at the stuff which these men are 
about to put into the furnace. It is pure sand mixed with 
soda or potash and lime in just the right quantities. The 
mixing must be thoroughly done, and sometimes the mix- 
ture is ground to a powder before putting in. The sand 
must be good, and it is often purified by washing, roasting, 
and grinding. Much of that now used comes from Berk- 
shire, Massachusetts; Juniata County, Pennsylvania; Han- 
cock County, West Virginia; and certain places in Illinois 
and Missouri. The most extensive beds worked are those 
of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. The lime is usually 
made of powdered limestone or chalk, and for fine glass 
the best marble dust is employed. In some glass, lead 
takes the place of the lime, in which cases red lead or a 
kind of yellow lead is employed. When the mixture is 
complete it is known as a batch, and is then ready for the 
pots or tank in which it is melted. 
We first examine one of the tank furnaces, in which 
most of our common window glass is made. We watch 
the men as they shovel the batch into the great long deep 
tank of fire clay, mixing a little broken glass with it, that 
it may melt the more easily. The stuff goes in at one end 
and after melting flows out at the other. The heat is fur- 
nished by gas flames which pour over the mixture, the tem- 
perature being so high that the sand, soda, and lime are 
soon one molten mass which seethes and boils and bubbles 
under the flames. 
As the mixing continues the impurities rise to the sur-

face and are so held back by floaters of fire brick that 
when the furnace is opened only the pure glass can pass 
out. From time to time new charges are put in, and the 
fire is kept going for months. The molten glass is usually 
allowed to stand for a while in order that its materials may 
be easily mixed and the glass be refined. During this 
time it is skimmed and samples are taken out and tested. 
  ‘We shall see plate glass made first.” 
It is next cooled, in which process it changes from a liquid 
state to a dough or paste, which can be blown into various 
shapes. 
We shall see plate glass made first. We watch a pot 
of molten glass as it is taken from the furnace and lowered 
upon a truck. This is pushed through the room to a 
large iron table, where the pot is lifted by a crane and 
poured out. The hot glass comes forth much like taffy, 
ready for pulling. It is kept on the table by narrow

  198 A VISIT TO A GLASS FACTORY 
strips of metal which run around the edges. These strips 
determine the thickness of the sheets to be rolled. When 
the molten glass has been emptied, a heavy iron roller 
which travels on these strips is passed over the table, 
pressing the glass out and making it smooth and level. 
The table and roller must both be heated before the glass

is poured out in order that it may not be too rapidly cooled. 
The rolling must be carefully done. 
As soon as the plate is rolled, it is taken to a second 
furnace, where it is annealed or tempered. This furnace 
has been raised to the same degree of heat as that of the 
glass upon leaving the rolling, and is so arranged that the 
plate will cool slowly during a number of days. 
The plate is now ready for smoothing and polishing. 
As it comes from the annealing furnace it is rough, and

thicker-in some places than in others. It must be ground 
down until it is srnooth and even throughout. This is done 
by fastening it to a table over which cast-iron rollers are 
made to slide, while coarse sand and water are sprinkled 
upon them. The sand grinds the glass to the right thick- 
ness, and it is smoothed and polished by rollers covered 
with leather or felt and emery dust. After this it is further 
polished with rouge. 
About one half the 
thickness of the 
plate is cut away 
during the grinding. 
But suppose we 
go to those long fur- 
naces on the other 
side of the works, 
  where the half- Making window glass. 
naked men are mak- 
ing the common window glass we have in our houses. Each 
man stands before the furnace at a door which rests just   above a long narrow pit in the floor. Now.he opens the 
door, and we can see the red-hot mass of glass dough 
within. The man has a long iron pipe in his hand, with a 
mouthpiece at one end. He puts the pipe into the fur- 
nace, and dips it into the metal, as the hot soft glass is 
called. He twists it about and rolls the glass on it into a 
lump, just as one might do with rather stiff taffy. He 
keeps on twisting until his lump weighs about twenty 
pounds, when he lifts it out and holds it down in the pit. 
He now puts the other end of the pipe into his mouth and 
blows, whirling the pipe between the palms of his hands,
-P-A-G-E-200

As he does so the lump gradually assumes a pear shape. 
It is now laid upon a smooth slab of iron or marble and 
rolled over and over, and then put into the furnace again. 
A little later it is 
taken out, and again 
blown until at last 
the pear has become 
a beautiful cylinder 
of glass, closed at 
one end and at- 
tached to the blow- 
pipe at the other. 
It is now as tall as

or more in diameter. This cylinder has been made by 
blowing the giass, while swinging it to and fro at the end 
of the pipe in the pit. 
But let us see what the man is doing with his cylinder. 
He has put it back 
into the furnace, and 
is heating it again.

he closes the mouth 
of the blowpipe with

the shoulder at the other end of the cylinder, next the blow-

A line is now drawn with a diamond from one end to

what is known as the flattening kiln. In a short time it 
opens along the cut made by the diamond, and under the 
influence of the heat flattens out so that it forms a smooth 
sheet of glass. This is window glass ready to be cut into

oven, hot at one end and cool at the other, the glass being 
carried by a system of endless iron bands very slowly from 
the hot end to the cool one. Window glass is more easily 
broken than plate glass, and is less durable when ex- 
posed to wind pressure. The furnaces in which the batch 
for sheet glass is melted 
are usually large. Some 
are from one hundred 
and fifty to two hun- 
dred feet long, thirty 
féet wide, and four or 
five feet deep. <A fac- 
tory can turn out a vast 
deal of glass in a year, 
the monthly output of 
one of the Pennsylvania 
establishments being 
enough to cover a space 
of twelve acres and 
leave some to spare. 
Glass bottles and jars 
are generally blown, 
machinery being largely 
employed. The necks 
of the bottles are first pressed and the body of the bottle 
afterwards blown to the form desired in molds in which the 
raised letters, which are sometimes seen on the outside of 
such glassware, are carved. We make hundreds of mil- 
lions of glass bottles a year; enough, it is said, supposing 
each bottle to be eight inches long and all to be placed end 
to end, to go three times around the world. We manufac-

ture also millions of lamp chimneys and tumblers, and a 
great deal of pressed glass. The latter is made in molds, 
which are hot at the time the glass is poured in. The 
pressed articles are afterwards heated almost to melting to 
give them a polish. 
In cut glassware the pieces are first blown or pressed 
into shape, and the designs are then ground out by means 
of a wheel of soft steel or copper or sandstone, the cutting 
edge of the wheel being fed with water and sand or emery 
powder. The polishing is done on similar wheels made of 
wood, fed with rouge or putty powder. : 
Glass made of lead and sand instead of lime and sand is 
softer and more brilliant than other varieties and is used 
for cut glass. 
Colored glass is formed by adding oxides or other forms 
of various metals to the batch, and mirrors are made by 
coating one side of the finished glass with silver. Mirrors 
were formerly coated with an amalgam of tin and mercury, 
but the silver mirror is now about the only kind made. 
The window glass making we have seen has been done 
in tank furnaces, a great mass of glass being made at a 
time. In plate glass factories the materials are melted in 
great pots of fire clay, which are filled with the batch and 
then inserted in the furnace where the melting is done. 
In such melting it is important that the pots be raised 
to the temperature of the furnace before the batch is 
put in. 
In making glass the character of the fuel is important. 
It must burn quickly and yield a long flame without 
much smoke or soot, and for this reason wood is 
often employed. For most kinds of glass, however, the

common fuel is coal; and natural gas, such as is found in 
Pennsylvania and Indiana, is greatly desired. When the 
gas fields there were at their best many factories were es-

diminished and crude petroleum and coal are now used in 
its stead.

Did we not know that these things are actually done, we 
might think the fairy queen joking, and be amazed to see 
them performed.. It is with such wonders that we are to 
deal in the next field of our travels. 
Suppose we leave the United States for a short run 
through the poplar and spruce forest belts of British

America. These woods have a soft fibrous nature which 
especially fits them for making the pulp from which the 
most of our wall papers come. Spruce and poplar are not 
uncommon trees. We have vast areas of them, and they 
are scattered here and there through much of our woods. 
Europe has many such trees, and they are found in great

numbers in Russia and Finland, and on the Scandinavian 
Peninsula, in all of which regions thousands of men are 
kept busy felling the trees and grinding them up into 
paper. 
The greatest wood pulp forests of all are in the Domin- 
ion of Canada. There is a wide belt which begins in the 
province of Quebec on the Atlantic Ocean, and extends 
westward through northern Ontario to beyond the Great
-P-A-G-E-207
  PAPER 207 
Lakes. Newfoundland has a vast deal of pulp wood, and 
in a single river basin in Quebec, enough trees are still 
standing to make more than one hundred million tons of 
such wood. Canada has more than twoscore mills which 
are always grinding the wood into pulp, and its output is 
several hundred thousand tons every year. It not only 
makes a great deal of pulp and paper for its own people, 
but it ships much across the boundary to us. 
As to the United States, we use more wood pulp than 
any other part of the world. Nine tenths of all our paper 
comes from trees of one kind or other, and this not only 
from our own’ forests but from pulp wood imported from 
Canada. We have enormous mills in Maine and else- 
where devoted to the industry. Our output is many mil- 
lion pounds of paper a day, and more, it is said, than that 
of all the paper mills of the rest of the world put together. 
Of this about one fourth goes into newspapers, some daily 
journals needing so much that a single issue requires one 
hundred tons or enough to clear the spruce forest from six 
acres of land. We have a mill in Maine which eats up 
from fifteen to eighteen acres of good forest every twenty- 
four hours. The wood is spruce, and the logs annually 
consumed are so many that if they could be spliced end to 
end they would reach from the site of the mill in northern 
Maine to the forests of Russia, where they are cutting 
similar wood for the paper of Europe. 
But suppose we visit the mills and see for ourselves 
how wood is turned into paper. There are several in 
Canada not far from our boundary, and one of the most 
important is situated at the falls of the Saint Marys 
River, through which the waters of Lake Superior take
-P-A-G-E-208
  
208 PAPER 
their twenty-foot drop to the level of Lake Huron. In 
making wood pulp a high degree of power is required, and 
these mills are near the site of one of the chief water 
powers of our continent. They are really harnessed to 
Lake Superior, and are using part of a force equal to sixty 
thousand horses all pulling at once. The mills are on the 
  It is first sawed into blocks two feet in length. 
Canadian side of the Falls and the power for them is trans- 
mitted through a canal into which the water rushes at the 
rate of fifty thousand gallons a second. It requires a large 
barrel to hold fifty gallons. One of that size full of water 
would weigh over four hundred pounds, or more than four 
of the fattest boys in our party. Now, if we can imagine 
the force that might be created by one thousand such bar- 
rels or four thousand boys dropping from the second story 
of a house to the ground every time the watch ticks, all day 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  PAPER 209 
and all night, and every day and every night the year 
through, we can appreciate something of the force of the 
water as it goes through this canal. A great deal of the 
power is used for other manufacturing works near by, but 
much is employed to run the pulp mills. The water falls 
upon turbine wheels, which turning, communicate the 
motion to the machines overhead. 
We first ask to see the wood before it goes into the 
mills. It has been cut during the winter in the far-away 
forests, and hauled upon sleds to the streams or the rail- 
roads. It is floated or carried down to the lakes, and then 
brought in rafts to the mills. Here it is first cut by a cir- 
-cular saw into blocks, each about two feet in length, after 
which the bark is shaved off by machinery consisting of 
rapidly revolving blades which make a deafening noise as 
they cut their way through. After that the wood, now 
clean and white, is ready to be carried on the endless belts 
through the wide galvanized iron passageway which leads 
up to the mill. If you will imagine a round stick of kitchen 
stove wood ready for splitting, you may have about the size 
of each piece. 
We watch the men throw the wood on the belt, and 
then go on to see it ground to a pulp. We enter a large 
room in which are many small mills of iron about eight 
feet in diameter, and not more than eight feet in height. 
Each has a grindstone within it, and this is so arranged, 
that as the sticks fall in they are forced against it so that 
the wood is rubbed off. The stones move about at the rate 
of two hundred revolutions a minute and grind the wood as 
though it were cheese. It drops down as dust into the 
water, and when it comes out it looks like chewed paper,

It is now wood pulp, and has only to be purified and 
felted before it is ready for the market. As we look the 
foreman opens one of the mills, and asks us to take up 
some of the pulp. We do so, and find it quite hot. 
He tells us that the water flows into the mill icy cold, but 
  Inside a pulp mill. 
that the friction of the grinding is such that it soon boils 
and steams. 
After the pulp comes from the mill it is forced through 
wire netting in order to strain it, and is then thrown back 
into a tank of clean water in which a cylinder covered with 
wire gauze is revolving. The water passes through the 
gauze, but the pulp sticks to the cylinder, which, turning, 
drops it upon an endless blanket where it forms a coat and 
is felted together. As it goes on it is dried and pressed,
-P-A-G-E-211

and finally comes out in huge rolls ready for shipment all 
over the world to be made into newspapers or perhaps into 
the beautifully colored wall papers we have in our houses. 
Sometimes the pulp comes out as thick cardboard, intended 
to be reworked before it is made into paper. Sometimes 
it is‘in paper ready for printing, a single sheet of which is 
so thin that four thousand pressed together are only one 
foot in height. 
In another part of the mill, wood-pulp is made by a 
chemical process. In this there is no grinding whatever. 
After the bark is removed, the logs are cut into chips, and 
then put into an enormous steel tank or boiler, filled with 
sulphurous acid and steam. These eat into the wood and 
digest it as it were, much as our stomachs digest food. 
The temperature is about twice that of boiling water. 
The cooking goes on for eight or ten hours and it finally 
reduces the chips to a pulp, which is then ready for the 
manufacture of paper. 
Another process consists in boiling the chips under pres- 
sure with a caustic soda and limewater. This produces a 
dark-colored pulp which is easily bleached. There is also 
a third process, by which the wood chips are boiled under 
pressure in sulphate of soda. : 
It is by such means that not only our wall papers, but 
also the greater part of our newspapers and books are 
dragged out of the trees of the forest. In Shakespeare’s 
play “ As You Like It,” the Duke, while voicing the de- 
lights of solitude in the forest of Arden, says : — 
“ And this our life, exempt from public haunt, 
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, 
Sermons in stones, and good in everything.”
-P-A-G-E-212
  
212 THE STORY OF PAPER 
It remained, however, for modern industry to make the 
trees really speak, and, by the water power of the running 
brook, to turn them into printed books, such as this we are 
reading.

25. THE STORY OF PAPER 
O-DAY we shall learn of papers made of other mate- 
rials than wood pulp; and, going back to the begin- 
ning of things, we shall ask how man discovered that fibers 
could be matted together into the beautiful sheets and webs 
we use for writing, printing, and house decoration. We 
shall find that wood pulp is a modern invention, and that it 
is through it alone that we are able to produce beautiful 
papers cheaply. Indeed, the papers made by the ancients 
were so costly that they could be used only for writing ; 
and in the Middle Ages the parchment upon which books 
were written was so hard to get that the works of learned 
scholars were sometimes soaked or rubbed off that the 
blank pages might be used for new composition. 
As to the world’s first paper makers, they were probably 
not men at all. They were hornets and other wasps which 
make their homes of wood pulp. Hornets chew the 
woody fibers and by the aid of their saliva make them into 
a pulp of which they build the large oval nests found in 
our woods. It is possible some of you may be able to get 
one for your house-building museum. I warn you, how- 
ever, to be sure the nest has been vacated before you at- 
tempt to secure it; for the little paper makers can sting 
and they will sally forth as an army in defense of their 
homes. The color of the nest is light gray, and its outer 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  THE STORY OF PAPER 213 
walls are layers of paper. Each nest has a hole or door 
at the bottom, and its interior is composed of floors filled 
with combs supported by columns with passages between. 
The cells of the combs are of the same shape as those of 
the honeybee, but the walls are of paper instead of wax. 
They are really hornets’ apartment houses, and some single 
ones are so large that 
they have thousands of 
cells. 
The first human paper 
makers were the Egyp- 
tians, those ancient 
people who lived in the 
Nile Valley ages ago, 
and to whom the world 
owes so much for the 
beginnings of its civili- 
zation. If we could. 
cross the Atlantic Ocean 
on one of the steamers 
which go weekly from 
New York to the Strait 
of Gibraltar, and thence 
sail over the Mediterra- 
nean Sea to Alexandria, we might visit the spot where was 
the most famous library of ancient times. This was com- 
posed of scrolls of writings upon a paper known as papyrus. 
And if we could travel far up the Nile into the Sudan, we 
should find there vast swamps filled with papyrus reeds, 
similar to those from which that first paper was made. 
I have seen much papyrus during my travels in that

part of Africa. It is a tall slender reed which at the 
ground may be as thick as the arm of a man, and at the 
top, where it ends in a great tassel of green, no bigger 
around than the finger of your baby sister. Some of the 
stalks are taller than a boy upon horseback, often reaching 
a height of fifteen or more feet. Each reed has a skin, 
surrounding a pith through which long fibers run. 
  
  Papyrus reeds similar to those from which the first paper was made. 
In making paper the ancient Egyptians took off the skin, 
and sliced the pith into long thin strips. They laid these 
strips side by side, and then placed other strips upon top at 
right angles tothem. The two layers were then rolled and 
pressed; and by the natural gum or sap in the plant were 
cemented into a crude paper, which, when dried and rubbed 
smooth, could be used for writing. 
After finishing, the paper was cut into long rectangular 
sheets, which were rolled up and tied with a string. The
-P-A-G-E-215
  
THE STORY OF PAPER 215 
ordinary sheet was about twelve inches long and eight 
inches wide, or of about the size of our foolscap paper of 
to-day. 
In ancient times the papyrus plant is supposed to have 
grown in lower Egypt, and some believe that the cradle or 
ark in which little Moses lay in the bulrushes on the edge 
of the Nile was made of it. We know that it was used 
by the people of that time for making boats, boxes, and 
baskets, and that its fibers were woven into mattings and 
sails. 
The first use of papyrus for writing was at an earlier 
date than 3500 B.c.; for a manuscript has been found 
which was made at that time. Others of the ancient 
papyrus writings have been taken from the old Egyptian 
tombs, and there are many such in the world’s great 
museums, including that of Chicago, whose collection is 
especially fine. 
Have you ever seen parchment? It is a tough paper 
made of sheepskin or goatskin. It is of the same material 
as a drumhead, but whiter and smoother. For many cen- 
turies it formed the chief writing paper of Europe, being 
employed for deeds and legal documents of all kinds. It 
. was used for bookmaking, and a volume the size of this we 
are reading made of it would have required a large flock of 
sheep or goats to furnish the pages. 
The invention of parchment, says Pliny the Roman, 
came from the rivalry of two ancient cities. These were 
Alexandria at the mouth of the Nile, and Pergamus, which 
lay across the Mediterranean in Asia Minor, about fifty 
miles from where Smyrna now stands. By the scale of miles 
we can locate the two towns on the map. Now the Alex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  216 THE STORY OF PAPER 
audrians boasted of their magnificent library, and this made 
the people of Pergamus jealous and they planned to estab- 
lish an even greater one in their city. Thereupon Attalus, 
the king of Pergamus, sent to Egypt for a great quantity 
of papyrus, and planned to hire numerous scholars who 
should not only copy 
all the books known 
but write others as 
well. The Egyp- 
tians, however, who 
had a monopoly of 
the papyrus of the 
world, refused to 
sell to the people 
of Pergamus and 
they were therefore 
forced to secure 
something else as a 
writing material. In 
casting about for 
this they discovered 
the value of sheep- 
skins and goatskins, 
and they prepared 
these so well that 
  Japanese interior, the rooms have movable 
screens of paper. 
their wares became famous, the skins being known as per- 
gamena, from which comes our word parchment. 
It is doubtful, however, whether sheepskins were not 
used for writing long before that; for we know that men 
had written upon skins of various kinds prior to the found- 
ing of Pergamus. For instance, there was in one of the
-P-A-G-E-217
  
  THE STORY OF PAPER BEG. 
ancient Egyptian libraries, so a historian says, a manu- 
script of snakes’ skins upon which in letters of gold were 
written the works of Homer, the poet, who described 
the adventures of Ulysses, and told all about the flying 
horse Pegasus, the horrid Minotaur, and the wicked Circe, 
who changed men into hogs. 
But however that may be, parchment continued to be 
used as a paper for many centuries after Pergamus was 
forgotten; and even now it is sometimes employed for 
college diplomas and important state papers. It is also 
used for costly book bindings. 
In making parchment the skins are soaked in a lime pit 
until the hair can be taken off. They are next stretched 
upon a square wooden frame, and scraped with sharp in- 
struments until they are perfectly smooth. They are then 
. rubbed with pumice stone and chalk, until at last they 
are as smooth as glazed paper. By this process the skins 
are reduced to less than half their original thickness; they 
shine like ivory and are given a surface which will take 
the ink easily. 
It is to the Chinese, that great people who invented the 
compass, gunpowder, and printing, that we are indebted 
for our first knowledge of paper made of wood pulp. Just 
when the Chinese discovered how to make such paper is 
not known; but they were manufacturing it from the mul- 
berry tree while Europe was still using parchment. It is 
said that the Arabs, who conquered much of west Asia, 
discovered the secret during one of their campaigns, and 
that they introduced paper making into the towns and 
cities of Asia Minor. The Crusaders and others who 
visited that region brought the art into Europe.
-P-A-G-E-218
    218 THE STORY OF PAPER 
Such paper was common in France before Columbus 
discovered America, and for a long time the French and 
Dutch were the chief paper makers of Europe. The 
Chinese papers had been made almost altogether from 
the inner bark of the paper mulberry tree, boiled and 
thus reduced to a pulp. After that the fibers were col- 
lected and felted on a framework or sieve of fine strips of 
bamboo. This was dipped into the pulp in such a way 
that when the water drained off the fibers were felted 
together. The sheets were then stripped from the sieve, 
and dried in the sun. After that they were smoothed and 
pressed out for use. ; 
The people of Europe had but few mulberry trees, and 
they soon began to make paper of other materials. In 
Spain they used flax and then cotton, and after a time it 
was discovered that excellent paper could be made out of 
rags. Indeed, until within recent times the greater part 
of the paper of the world was made of worn-out clothing 
of cotton and linen. 
The first paper used in America was of linen rags, and 
our first mill was established at Germantown, near Phila- 
delphia, its product being only a few pounds of paper a 
day. In those times paper was scarce, and rags were in 
great demand. In a Boston newspaper, published in 1769, 
it is stated that “the bell cart will go through Boston be- 
fore the end of the month to collect rags for the paper 
mills at Milton,” and the editors requested that the women 
encourage the business by saving their rags. In 1776 
Massachusetts made a law that certain men in each of its 
towns should be appointed to collect rags for the mills, and 
the people were asked to save them in order that the new
-P-A-G-E-219
THE STORY OF PAPER 219 
country might have the paper needed for printing, gun 
wadding, and other purposes. 
After the Revolution, our paper-mills increased rapidly. 
Machines were invented for beating the pulp and for 
weaving or felting it into a continuous sheet. The latter 
process was the Fourdrinier invention, an endless web of 
wire gauze, supported on horizontal rollers. This enabled 
the liquid pulp to be felted into an endless sheet of paper, 
and so treated that it came out polished and cut into sheets. 
The same machinery, somewhat improved, is used to-day. 
It is like that we saw in the mills making wood pulp. The 
pulp goes in at one end of the machine, and comes out at 
the other a finished paper, either in sheets or wound in 
the immense rolls which are used for our newspapers and 
books. Paper may be colored by adding dyes to the pulp; 
and the watermark in it is often produced by a slightly 
raised design on the wire gauze of the machine. This 
makes the paper a very little thinner along the lines of the 
pattern, and thus forms the watermark. 
Some of our finest writing papers are made of rags, 
which we import not only from Europe but from Asia and 
elsewhere; so that the tinted notes upon which we send 
out invitations to parties may be composed of the cast-off 
clothing of savages. The rags come to the mills in huge 
bales and are thrown into the thresher, a round machine in 
which they are pounded and torn into bits, the dust being 
carried off through air tubes. After that they are sorted 
by women and girls, and the buttons, hooks, and eyes are 
removed. 
The rags are then cut into pieces by machinery, when 
they are again whipped until all the dust and dirt have gone
-P-A-G-E-220
220 THE STORY OF PAPER 
out. The next process is boiling them, under steam pres- 
sure, in'a mixed solution of lime, soda, and water. This 
makes the rags as white as snow, but they are still further 
washed, beaten, and cut, being finally reduced to a pulp 
from which the paper is made. 
In addition to the papers we have seen, there are some 
made of straw, cornstalks, jute, rope ends, and other fibrous 
materials of various kinds. The English make an excel- 
lent printing paper 
of the esparto grass 
which grows in 
northern Africa 
along the edges of 
the Sahara, and is 
brought to the ports 
upon camels. The 
Japanese make 
paper of bamboo 
fibers and they have 
various kinds of plants which they raise for this purpose. 
  Lodded with esparto grass to be used for 
making paper. 
The chief paper employed in building, however, comes 
from wood pulp. This is so not only of that which covers 
our walls, but of the thick, coarse sheets used for lining the 
inside framework of our houses and those coated with tar 
and other materials, which compose the various kinds of 
paper roofing everywhere sold. 
Much of the wall paper is colored and printed in beauti- 
ful patterns, some of which are so raised that they look like 
stamped leather. This is done upon presses of various 
kinds, the paper running through one set of rollers after 
another, each roller printing one of the colors used in the -

design. When the wall paper comes from the press, it 
has only to be dried and cut into the lengths required for 
the market. Other fine papers are printed by hand from 
blocks. In this process a separate block is engraved for 
each color, and the printer impresses the design upon the 
roll, handling the blocks so carefully that the finished pic- 
tures appear to have been printed. Gold and bronze papers 
are often made in this way, and velvety papers are pro- 
duced by using the beautifully colored waste of the silk 
mills, the floss being cut fine and pressed into the design by 
the aid of an ink to which the silk sticks.

E must put on rough clothes for our travels to-day. 
We may as well roll up our sleeves and go as 
poorly clad as we can. Those who are especially dainty 
had better wear gloves, and the Miss Nancys among us 
might don aprons as well. We are to travel in the world 
of paints, oils, and varnishes, and some of our journeys may 
be not overclean. : 
We have already seen that these homes of ours, which 
we have taken so much as a matter of course, are really 
museums composed of wonderful things which have come 
from far-away places and through many different adven- 
tures. With the lumber we have traveled through the 
wilds of the forest, and with building stones and the metals 
have gone down under the earth into the quarries and 
mines. Like the Hebrew children we have passed through 
the fiery furnace in the manufacture of glass, and in our

study of paper have crossed the oceans to China and trav- 
eled from the papyrus swamps of the Nile to the woods of 
spruce and poplar along the Great Lakes. 
The stories of paints, oils, and varnishes are likewise 
full of variety, and will necessitate our going to other parts 
of the world. The materials in them embrace the mineral 
and vegetable kingdoms; and, with the brushes used in 
laying them on, the animal kingdom as well. 
Most of our paints are from pigments, which are mineral 
or organic bodies that can be ground up and mixed with oil, 
water, or spirits, in such a way that they can be spread 
over wood metal or other materials, giving them a color 
corresponding to the pigments used. The color of the 
pigment depends upon the amount and kind of light which 
it reflects; and, according to this, it may be of almost any 
hue or tint of the rainbow. The chief pigments are whites, 
blues, greens, yellows, reds, browns, and blacks, all of which 
have many divisions. 
Pigments form the basis of our paints of various kinds, 
the paint consisting of the pigment mixed with some drying 
oil or spirits containing a gum or size. After painting, the 
oils or spirits evaporate or become dry, leaving the pigment 
which gives the color and with the gum or size preserves 
the material upon which the paint is spread. 
Pigments come from so many different sources that we 
have not time to examine them all. There are some, 
however, which are more important than others, and the 
chief of these is white lead. That substance combines 
easily with linseed oil, and can thus be spread over wood, 
iron, and steel, giving them a tight coat which keeps out 
the sun and rain.
-P-A-G-E-223

If you will go back in your mind to our travels in the 
mines, you may see where lead comes from and how 
difficult it is to take it out of the earth. At first thought 
one might say it would be impossible to secure enough of 
it to cover the houses of even one mighty city. And

indeed, it would be so were the metal laid on in sheets or 
plates. It is different, however, with lead when used as 
paint. In this shape the houses of not only one city but of 
hundreds of cities are covered with lead. Each of our 
homes has more or less of it in one form or other. It 
coats both steel and wood, and guards them from the 
demons of rust and decay.  
-P-A-G-E-224
  
  224 ’ PAINTS, OILS, AND VARNISHES 
Of all the lead pigments, white lead is by far the most 
important. It was used by the Romans as a body for 
various paints, not only for buildings but even cosmetics. 
Indeed, the Roman ladies are said to have spread lead on 
their cheeks to improve their complexions. Later on white 
lead was made by the Dutch, and when our country was 
settled, a white lead industry began here. This increased 
rapidly as our lead mines were discovered, and we have 
now many factories for making lead paints. We have also 
some devoted to paints made of other pigments, and 
all together thousands of men are engaged in the paint- 
making industry. 
In manufacturing white lead, sheets of the metal are 
thrown into vats containing an acid, or they are exposed 
to the vapor of an acid similar to vinegar. This corrodes 
the metal, forming acetate of lead. The acetate is ground 
fine and mixed with a small percentage of linseed oil, 
making the paint we know as white lead. It is put up in 
cans, kegs, buckets, and barrels to be sold. White lead is 
also made by other processes, but those in which acid is 
used have been known for hundreds of years and are still 
most largely employed. 
Red lead is the oxide of lead. It is employed not only, 
in painting, but also in glassmaking and in tightening or 
efilling the joints of plumbing or piping. Litharge is a 
yellow lead oxide, made by melting the lead under a great 
heat in rapidly revolving cast-iron vessels. 
In addition to these lead pigments we have many com- 
posed of various other metals and substances. There are 
blue pigments made of copper and cobalt, and also ultra- 
marine, whose material is of about the same nature as the
-P-A-G-E-225
    
PAINTS, OILS, AND VARNISHES @ 225 
beautiful stone known as lapis lazuli. Prussian blue is a 
compound containing iron, and indigo comes from the juice 
of a reed which grows abundantly in Java and India. 
The green pigments come largely from copper, and the 
yellows are from lead and zinc and from certain kinds of 
iron and other metals. Some of the chief reds are from 
lead, mercury, and arsenic, while the browns are likewise 
largely from metals. 
An odd pigment is the sepia, a brown which comes from 
the cuttlefish. That fish has a small bag or sac inside it 
where it secretes a brown, inklike fluid which it gives out 
when attacked or disturbed. The liquid discolors the 
water about it, and it can thus hide its movements. In 
preparing the pigment, the fish is caught, and the sac 
carefully removed and dried. It is next dissolved in 
caustic soda, and so treated with acid that it can be used 
for paint making. 
The black pigments are nearly all based upon carbon, 
the same substance found so largely in coal. The most 
important is lampblack, which is made of soot of various 
kinds such as that from the smoke of pine and hemlock 
or from that of petroleum or other mineral oils. In making 
lampblack the burning is carefully done, the soot being 
caught in a series of chambers through which the smoke 
goes. Bone black is made of burnt bone, ivory black of 
ivory, and some other blacks of charcoal ground fine.

of the mineral kingdom to give him metals to preserve 
and beautify the home he lives in? Yes, but we must re-

member that these genii have required other genii to aid 
them. They have worked in connection with their brothers 
of the vegetable kingdom who have furnished the turpen- 
tine, linseed oil, and other such things without which the 
pigments, however fine they might be ground, could not be 
used. Indeed, we are indebted for our paints to these 
materials almost as 
much as to the pig- 
ments themselves. 
Linseed oil is pressed 
from the seed of the 
flax plant, the fibers of 
which give us our linen. 
The seeds are cleaned 
and then ground into 
meal. After that they 
are steamed and then 
packed up in bags of 
pure camel’s hair. 
While in the bags they 
are placed in huge 
presses which, exerting 
a force equal to two 
  Crushing flaxseed in presses. 
tons per square inch, cause the oil in the seeds to flow out. 
It is then filtered and run off into tanks ready to be barreled 
for the painters. 
Linseed oil is used in three different forms — raw, boiled, 
and refined. Raw oil is the oil as it comes from the press. 
. Boiled oil is the raw oil cooked over a fire with certain 
chemicals added to increase its drying properties; and re- 
fined oil is so treated that it can be used for varnish in

PAINTS, OILS, AND VARNISHES 227 
connection with gums and other materials. Raw oil is 
largely used in paint grinding, and every year millions of 
gallons of it are spread over our homes in the form of mixed 
paints. In every hundred pounds of white lead there are 
a little more than seven gallons of oil, so that oil is used 
more or less upon every room we live in. 
This oil, boiled or refined, is also employed in the manu- 
facture of linoleum and 
oilcloth. The oiled suits 
worn by sailors and fisher- 
men are soaked in it, and 
it is used in making pa- 
tent leather shoes and in 
other kinds of dressed 
leathers. It forms a part 
of our carriage tops and 
is also employed in mak- 
ing oiled silk. Mixed 
with ink, it comes before 
our eyes daily as we read 
the newspapers, and it is 
likely that the print on 
this page has some linseed oil in it. The paint industry, 
however, consumes the greater part of the product, de- 
manding so much that the oil manufacture employs mil- 
lions of capital and consumes a vast deal of seed. The 
mills for making linseed oil are scattered here and there 
over the United States, the chief centers of its manufacture 
being at Buffalo, Chicago, Minneapolis, and New York.

_take a look at the long-leafed pine trees, from the sap of

which comes turpentine, another material used largely in 
the mixing of varnish and paint. Turpentine will thin all 
kinds of paints, and it is an excellent drier and mixer. It 
is also employed in the making of varnish. In gather- 
ing the sap, the trunks of the trees are scarred with axes

hole is chopped out at the foot of the tree into which the sap 
runs and is caught; or tin troughs are fastened in below the 
scars and a clay jar placed belowthem. The latter method 
is recommended by our Government Forestry Bureau. It 
is by far the better, as it does not injure the tree, which is 
soon destroyed if the boxes are cut in it, year after year. 
Every few days the men come along with scoops and 
take out the sap, which having been exposed to the 
air is almost as thick as molasses. They put the sap into

  PAINTS, OILS, AND VARNISHES 229 
barrels and carry it to the turpentine distilleries, which are 
great sheds in the forest under which kettles are boiling. 
The kettles are closed at the top, and from them metallic 
pipes run out in a coil, over which cold water pours. Pine 
tree sap is composed of turpentine and resin. After it is

‘thrown into the kettle, the boiling drives out the turpen-

the pipes kept cool by the water. As the vapor strikes their 
cold surface it condenses and changes to a liquid which flows 
out at the other end of the coil in the pure white spirits 
of turpentine we use for painting. Some of the turpentine 
farms, as these pine woods are called, have thousands of 
trees, and many men are employed in gathering the sap.

about through the swamps and thrust down into the earth

27. BUILDING A HOME 
E have all read of the troubles Robinson Crusoe 
had in making his home on the desert island. He 
first used a cave, like the cave dwellers of early times; 
and afterwards, bit by bit, with the aid of his black man, 
Friday, he built‘up his house and made it quite comfort- 
able. He had but few 
tools and was forced to 
all sorts of makeshifts 
to accomplish his ends. 
We shall now imagine 
ourselves to be a party 
of house builders. But

     not like Robinson Crusoe, x rr: eres 
for we shall perform the j fe] ea ES 
work of construction, not     
    
on a desert island, but sur-

iences, finished materials, 
modern machinery, and skilled workmen of the most ad- 
vanced people on earth. We shall not be able, like Alad- 
din of the Wonderful Lamp, to order a palace to-night 
and find it finished and furnished next morning, but we 
shall have all the advantages of modern civilization. 
How shall we start in the making of our home? The 
first thing is the site or place where the house is to stand.  
-P-A-G-E-233
BUILDING A HOME 233 
In the country or where land is comparatively cheap, 
we should select a large space with plenty of ground all 
around, or if in the city we might be confined to a lot so 
small that the house would cover it all. The first thing 
in each case would be to buy the ground, and to see that 
we had a clear title of ownership to it. This is important, 
for if we cannot prove that we own it, some one may 
raise the doubt and even after we have built force us to 
leave. Our parents can tell us how land is bought and 
sold, and how in the public offices records are kept of 
every tract which is transferred from one man to another. 
One form of the record of such a transfer is shown on the 
following page. 
After having satisfied ourselves with the lot and its title, 
we are ready to talk of the house and the plans. It will 
not do to start building until we know just what we want. 
This can be shown by plans drawn to a scale and 
accompanied by written explanations or specifications of 
all the materials and how they are to be used. We may 
get these of an architect, whose business it is to make plans 
for houses. If we tell him our néeds he will furnish a 
design of the kind of a dwelling that will supply them. He 
may charge us so much for the plans, or may say that for 
an additional sum he will also superintend the construction, 
and see that they are carried out. The architect’s charge is 
sometimes a percentage on what the house costs. If the 
house is small, and we know pretty well what it should con- 
tain, we may make the plans ourselves, although this is not 
advisable unless we have had some experience in building. 
After the plans and specifications are prepared, they may 
be let out to a builder who will contract to put up the

house at a fixed price or on acommission. If this is done, 
the builder will buy the materials, hire the workmen, and 
agree to deliver the house to us completed within a certain 
fixed time. He is under the superintendence of the architect, 
who sees that the plans are carried’out in all of their details. 
As to the construction of the house, this depends so 
much upon its location, character, size, and the materials 
of which it is built, that . 
the description of any 
one dwelling will not 
give us a rule for all 
others. The building 
conditions differ greatly 
in city and country, and 
the house whose founda- 
tion is on the sand re- 
quires things not needed 
by that which stands on 
arock. Houses of wood 
are not built like houses 
of brick or stone, and 
the great steel structure

deed, each of our dwell- 
ings is to a certain extent of its own kind, although it has 
many things which are common to all. 
First every house must have its foundation, its walls,       
  and its roof. The foundation must be firm and evenly 
fixed in the earth or the house may sink or lean like 
the great Tower at Pisa, and perhaps topple over. The 
foundation may be on firm ground or if the house must
-P-A-G-E-236
    236 BUILDING A HOME 
stand where the earth is not firm, piles may be driven 
down to make a foundation. This is the case in Amster- 
dam, where Erasmus said the people lived like birds on 
the tree tops. In our own country, buildings in marshy 
or swampy places are often erected upon foundations of 
concrete andiron. This is so in parts of Chicago, where 
on the soft ground near the lakes, steel rails are laid 
down and filled in with cement, and other rails laid above 
crisscross or at right angles, similarly filled, until a great 
solid block is formed upon which the house rests. Even 
greater precautions are required for the heavy steel struc- 
tures called skyscrapers, as we shall see later on. 
And then the walls of our houses! They vary from 
those in our massive stone buildings, two feet or more in 
thickness, to the tall office structures, which often consist 
of a framework of steel with only a thin veneering of brick 
or stone to keep out the weather. We have walls of wood, 
stone, brick, and concrete, and even sheet iron. 
It is the same with the roofs. They are of many ma- 
terials, each made and put on in its own way. Thousands 
of our buildings are covered with shingles from Oregon and 
Washington, and other thousands are protected by tin or 
galvanized iron. We have roofs of boards, slate, and 
glass. We have some of terra cotta tiles, glazed like fine 
china; and roofs of paper covered with asphalt or pitch upon 
which have been sprinkled pebbles or sand. Indeed, the 
manufacture of roofing materials alone forms an important 
industry, employing and supporting a great many people. 
But the foundation, walls, and the roof are merely the 
shells of our dwelling. They aid in keeping out the rain 
and sun, but alone they would not form a much better
-P-A-G-E-237
BUILDING A HOME 237 
home than that of the cave men. Indeed, we require 
so many things in addition that our houses are very 
beehives of invention. They must have floors and ceil- 
ings, windows and doors, stairways from story to story, 
and arrangements of various kinds for cooking, heating, 
and lighting, as well as for the water supply. 
All these things should be provided for in the plans; and 
in the cities or towns each class of house building is done 
by men who will do little else. The foundations and 
brick or stone walls must be laid up by masons, the wood- 
work is put together by carpenters, and if the roofs are 
of metal, they will be laid on by tinners and roofers. 
The piping of the house for gas, heat, and water will be 
done by the plumbers; while if we have electricity in any 
form we shall need electricians to wire the structure in 
such a way that it may not take fire. And then the paint- 
ing is to be done by another class of laborers, the lathing 
by another, the plastering by a third, and so on, each class 
having a place of its own. In the larger buildings the 
work is still further subdivided, until in the great office 
structure the laborers form a small army of many com- 
panies, each of which is skilled in one form of construction, 
and will do nothing else. 
Indeed, the work of house building becomes more compli- 
cated from year to year. New inventions bring forth new 
materials and new tools. Stone is now planed and carved 
by machinery ; wood moldings which were once laboriously 
cut out by hand are now made at the mills, ready to be fitted 
into the houses; and wire cloth sometimes takes the place 
of lath. We shall learn more about such features of build- 
ing construction as we go on with our travels.

28. THE WORLD’S TALLEST. BUILDINGS 
OME years ago a little black boy whose home was a 
thatched hut in the wilds of Africa was taken by a 
missionary to the city of New York. The voyage was 
made upon a steamer and the little fellow was interested 
in the mighty engines fed by coal which carried him over 
the oceans, and in the other strange things he saw upon 
shipboard. He was even more surprised at the wonders 
on land. He stayed for some months in America, and 
was then carried back to his people, who came together 
from far and near to hear what he had seen. The little 
fellow described the doings of steam and electricity. He 
told of the magic of the telephone, of the wagons without
-P-A-G-E-239
THE WORLD’S TALLEST BUILDINGS 239 
horses which flew over tracks of steel, of the automobiles 
which ate oil and had a bad smelling breath, and of the 
electric light through which, by touching a button, man 
could turn night into day. 
As he described these and other miracles, his black 
friends opened their eyes and mouths in amazement, half 
doubting whether what he said could 
be true. At last he began to tell of 
our houses and especially of the great 
structures of steel where a whole tribe 
of families dwelt in apartments one 
over the other, riding up and down 
to their homes in elevators which he 
called little cages of iron. He said 
that these buildings were so tall that 
the strongest and most skillful bow- 
man of Africa, standing upon the 
ground, could not shoot an arrow as 
high as their roofs. Upon that the 
whole crowd gave a shout and would 
hear nothing more. They talked the 
matter over together and concluded it 
could not be true and that the boy’s stories must be lies 
from beginning to end. 
We know, however, that the little fellow was well within 
bounds in such a description; and that we have many build- 
ings so high that the strongest archer could not shoot over 
them. The home of the Metropolitan Life Insurance 
Company in New York is more than one hundred feet 
higher than the Washington Monument; other buildings 
there have forty or fifty stories, and some of those planned 
  Park Row Building.

240 THE WORLD’S TALLEST BUILDINGS 
for the future, will be taller still. The Whitehall Building 
in lower New York has a roof higher above the ground 
than the top of the Great Pyramid and it covers more 
than a half acre. It 
has office accommoda- 
tions for four thousand 
people, who are lifted to 
its thirty-one floors by 
twenty-nine elevators, - 
eight of which are ex- 
presses that do not stop 
to let passengers off or on 
until the twentieth story 
is reached. The build- 
ing is heated by the aid 
of twenty miles of steam 
pipes, and its machin- 
ery is more varied than 
that of many great fac- 
tories. 
The Park Row Build- 
ing, opposite the New 
York Post Office, if we 
measure it from founda- 
tion to roof, although it 
is not so high by several 
hundred feet as some 
steel structures which 
have been erected since its completion, is almost as tall as 
the Washington Monument. Itweighs forty million pounds, 
and is supported by four thousand piles, driven forty feet

down through the sand to bed rock. It has thirty-one 
stories, and in these there are nine hundred and fifty 
offices. It has seventeen hundred 
doors, two thousand windows, and 
seventy-five hundred electric lights. 
But let us go to New York and 
take a look at some of these huge 
office structures. There are many 
which have long been completed and 
others are rapidly rising to accommo- 
date the great population which in- 
creases each year. Such buildings are

rapidly if they can be close together 
Therefore, as the space in the busi- 
ness centers is limited and the build- 
ings cannot be spread out, they have 
arranged to have them go up. Some 
of the land in lower New York is now 
worth a million and more dollars an 
acre, and only buildings of immense 
height will make it possible to earn 
a rent which is in proportion to its 
great cost. The more stories a building has the more 
offices and tenants it can accommodate, and the more 
  Times Building.

rent it will bring in. By the invention of steel construc- 
tion it has been found that story can be added to story, 
with safety; and, by flying elevators, the people can ride 
up and down, so that the man who lives higher up than 
the top of the tallest fir tree of the Oregon woods is carried 
to his office more quickly than the pioneer could climb the 
rude ladders which led to the loft of his cabin. 
The modern office building is often called “the sky- 
scraper” because, as one stands on the ground beside it, its 
roof seems almost to scrape the sky. It has been described 
as a steel bridge upon end, with passenger cars running up 
and down within it. It is made of steel, like that used in 
bridge building, the beams, joists, and rafters being rolled 
into shape at the mills and bolted together with hot rivets. 
Every piece in the great structure must be exactly right be- 
fore the work of erection begins, and the whole is put into 
shape like a gigantic puzzle, where each block has its place. 
After the framework has been joined, the huge skeleton 
must have its steel bones covered with a coat of brick, tile, 
or other material. Then the plaster is spread on the me- 
tallic lathing, and the floors laid. 
In the famous buildings of the past it was the walls which 
supported the floors and upheld the roof. In these steel 
structures, the walls serve merely as curtains to keep out 
the weather and are themselves supported by girders which 
project at the level of the floor. In the old buildings the 
walls were laid first. In the new ones the steel frame is 
erected and the walls are put on afterwards, the upper 
stories being sometimes walled in before the lower ones. 
During the construction the plumbing and wiring go on, 
and great furnaces, engines, and dynamos are installed in

the basement. I give on pages 244 and 245 pictures of the 
Metropolitan Building while in construction, and on page 
246 one of Madison Square, showing the tower completed. 
One of the most interesting features of the skyscraper is 
its foundation. The larger buildings are composed of steel, 
stone, and brick, and one may weigh thousands of tons. 
Indeed, a single building, with its contents, often weighs 
so much that, if it were taken apart and placed upon 
wagons, one hundred thousand horses all pulling at once 
could not haul the load. For such a structure, where the 
ground is not firm, an excavation must be made to bed 
rock, and concrete columns erected; ora great raft of steel 
rails laid crosswise and filled in with cement may form the 
base, in order that if it should sink the settlement will be 
even throughout. Under many of the New York buildings 
are hundreds of trees in the shape of piles which have been 
driven down into the sand for forty or more feet. These 
piles are in rows under those parts of the building 
which need most support. After they were driven far down 
into the earth, the sand was cleared away to a depth of a 
foot or so from the surface and concrete poured in, until it 
formed a great block of solid rock over the whole build- 
ing site securely upheld by the trees. On this concrete 
base, huge blocks of stone were laid, and upon them were 
erected the brick piers capped with granite to which the 
steel framework of the structure was fastened. 
The variety of things required in such building is 
so great we cannot mention all. A single large office 
structure reminds us of a little city under one roof. It 
may have its own gas and electric plants, and its own 
waterworks system fed perhaps by an artesian well

Of much the same nature are the apartment houses 
now to be found in all our large cities. In some of these 
scores of families dwell under one roof, being supplied by 
the heat, light, and water which come from the basement. 
Each family has an apartment or flat, consisting of several 
rooms connected together and all-on the same floor. It will 
have its own kitchen, dining room, and parlor, with enough

in which one may eat his meals or not as he chooses, 
and in some of them are playgrounds for the children,

native hotels or inns of some other lands. In China, India, 
and northern Africa they are little more than sleeping 
places for men and beasts. When the Arab travels upon 
his camel, he carries much of his food with him and does 
his own cooking wherever he stops. Great caravansaries 
or stablelike inns are to be found in such cities as Damas- 
cus, Fez, Tunis, and Cairo. There the traveler sleeps on 
the straw, with his camel or donkey near by. In China 
the country inns are often one-story structures with win- 
dows of paper, built about courts in which the donkeys 
and horses are stabled at night. One is lulled to sleep by 
the crunching of the cattle as they chew their cuds, and he 
is often awakened by the donkeys which bray in concert 
from time to time during the night.

The Japanese have neat hotels in both city and country; 
but at the native inns one must expect to sleep on the floor, 
and eat at low tables before which he kneels or sits cross- 
legged on cushions. He uses chopsticks; and the tea, 
rice, and other food will be brought to him on trays by 
little Japanese girls, who bump their heads on the floor in 
salutation as they come in to serve him. 
In a Turkish hotel the guests are often crowded into 
one or two rooms, many sleeping together. At dinner a 
roast sheep may be brought in whole; and the party may 
sit around this and each carve for himself. The Turks eat 
without forks and in taking up bits of meat from a stew 
they bend a piece of bread between thumb and finger and 
use it as pincers. Other nations of Asia and Africa have 
customs equally curious; and it is only the white race that 
has the modern hotel, with its separate room for each guest 
and its many conveniences. 
The first hotels of our country were known as taverns or 
inns, and each had a swinging sign which bore some such 
name as “The Red Lion,” “The Black Bear,” “The Eagle,” 
or perhaps “The Kings” or ‘‘The Queens.” After the 
Revolution, some of the latter signs were changed to “The 
Washington,” “ The Franklin,” or “The Lafayette” in 
honor of the great men of that day. When General 
Washington visited Boston he stayed at the “ Bunch of 
Grapes” tavern; and at Trenton he lived at “The True 
American Inn.” 
As the United States grew in wealth and population, 
hotels began to spring up in the cities; and after railroads 
came increasing the travel they grew larger and finer, 
until we now have some of the best hotels of the world,

  There are many such in New York, and it will pay us to 
visit them. 
The one we select is known all over the country, and, in- 
deed, we might say throughout the world. It has twenty- 
five stories above the ground and five stories below it, and 
the area of its floor space is such that if it were all on one 
level it would cover a good sized field. Its rooms are more 
than fifteen hundred in number, and when it is full, which 
‘is often the case, it contains, counting both servants and 
guests, more than three thousand people, its kitchens and

dining rooms being large enough to feed them all. This 
hotel has sufficient machinery in its basement to run a big 
factory. Its parlors are as beautifully furnished as the pal-

among the flowers and trees and watch the fountain play- 
ing while he listens to the music of the band. The hotel 
has more than fifteen hundred servants, and of these about 
one hundred are boys who run errands, show the guests to 
their rooms, and carry messages of various kinds. Each 
boy receives twenty-five dollars a month for his work, and 
in addition has many tips or presents from the guests. 
But let us suppose we have landed at the station and 
have ridden in a motor cab to the front entrance of this 
great establishment. Here we are met by the porter. 
He wears a gorgeous livery with brass buttons and has
-P-A-G-E-252
      252 IN A NEW YORK HOTEL 
a tall hat on his head. He takes care of our baggage and 
leads us into the office. This is a great room like a bank 
with a counter at the rear, behind which stand the clerks. 
The messenger boys conduct us to the counter, and a 
clerk gives us the visitor’s book in which we write our 
names and the towns from which we come. He then 
assigns each a room, saying that he will put us all on the 
twelfth floor. Before going up we walk around to the post 
office of the hotel 
and ask for our mail, 
stopping at the tele- 
graph desk to send 
word home to our 
fathers and mothers 
that we have safely 
arrived in New York. 
We next go up in 
one of the elevators 
and ask to be let off 
at the twelfth floor. 
Now we have entered our rooms. Each has a comfortable 
bed, a table or so, and some easy chairs. It has a bureau 
and wardrobe, and also a closet, inside which is a box which 
opens out into the hall. The boy tells us we can put our 
shoes there at night, and that they will be blackened by 
the time we awake in the morning. Connected with each 
room is a bath, with a large porcelain tub, and tiled walls 
and floor. The room has also a telephone, so that we can 
talk to people in New York and, by being switched on to 
the long distance lines, even chat with our friends at home. 
The telephone also connects us with the office of the hotel, ‘“Now we have entered our rooms.”
-P-A-G-E-253
  IN A NEW YORK ‘HOTEL 253 
and if we want pens and paper, or ice water, or almost 
anything else, we can call up the office and ask that it be 
sent to our rooms. Every floor has its own employees, 
and it will not be long before our orders are filled. 
We shall now go out and take a stroll through the hotel. 
The elevator carries us up to the roof, and we spend a 
while there in the garden. After that we go down from one 
floor to another, until at last we reach the one just over the 
office. This contains a great ballroom, an art gallery, and 
many beautiful parlors. It has the state banquet hall, a 
music room, and other gorgeous apartments. 
Descending to the main floor we stop to look into the 
dining room and restaurants, where hundreds of men 
women and children are eating their meals. They sit about 
little tables and are waited upon by men in black clothes. 
We are shown the bill of fare. It contains almost every 
eatable under the sun, and it seems to us the whole world 
has been working to supply food for these tables. There 
is fruit from everywhere; melons from Canada, oranges 
from California, and bananas from the West Indies. There 
are apples from Missouri, peaches from Georgia, and 
grapes from New York. There are meats and game of all 
descriptions, and vegetables of the tropic and temperate 
zones. As we look the manager tells us that the hotel 
consumes sixty thousand dollars’ worth of fish every year, 
and that its poultry alone costs twice as much. It uses 
about one hundred thousand dollars’ worth of fruits and 
vegetables, twenty thousand dollars’ worth of coffee, and 
eighteen thousand dollars’ worth of flour. It annually 
spends eighty thousand dollars for butter and eggs, and a 
quarter of a million dollars for meats.
-P-A-G-E-254

He asks us if we would not like to go down into the 
lower stories and see the supplies, and also visit the kitchens 
and other departments. We gladly accept his invitation 
and, entering the elevator and dropping five stories, find 
ourselves about fifty feet under ground. If the hotel were 
taken away, a four-story house could be dropped into the 
excavation, and with its ground floor where we are now its

roof would not reach the sidewalk. Nevertheless it is as 
light as day. There are hundreds of electric lights blazing 
away. The floor is of white tiles, and the walls and ceilings 
are white. We are in the machinery department. Over 
there at one side are the furnaces which keep the rooms 
warm. There are a number of them, each connected with 
an enormous boiler. They consume a hundred tons of coal 
in a day, and more than thirty-five thousand tons every 
year. They supply, not only the heat, but also the power
-P-A-G-E-255
  IN A NEW YORK HOTEL 255 
for the machinery and that which generates the electricity. 
They not only light and heat the hotel, but they cool it as 
well, for they run an ice-making factory where water is 
frozen in great blocks half as large as a library table. In 
this department there are many mechanics. There is a 
locksmith who makes keys for the rooms and keeps the 
clocks of the hotel in order. There are carpenters and 
cabinet makers, and electricians and engineers. 
We have now again entered the elevator, and ascended two 
stories to look at the kitchens. They cover almost an acre, 
and this space is taken up by stoves, broilers, great coffee 
urns, and kettles as big around as a hogshead, steaming 
with soup. There is one kitchen range which is as long 
as a city lot and half as wide as a schoolroom. Upon it 
food of all kinds is cooking ‘away. 
Here at the right is a bakery. That man in the white 
cap is the baker, and he can bake four thousand loaves of 
bread in a day. As we come up, he opens the oven. 
Its floor is as big as that of a parlor, and is covered with 
biscuits and rolls being cooked to a turn. } 
A little farther on are the butchers, some of whom cut 
nothing but steaks and chops all day long, and others 
dress only poultry and game. In a hotel like this each 
man has his own kind of work. The cooks who roast 
meat pay no attention to vegetables, and those who make 
the ice cream do not bother with the pastry. The hotel 
often consumes three hundred gallons of ice cream in one 
day, and it keeps several men busy freezing and molding 
it into the odd shapes in which it is served. The cooks 
are dressed in white with white caps. They are well paid 
and their chief has a big salary.
-P-A-G-E-256
  256 IN A NEW YORK HOTEL 
Leaving the kitchens we cross to the other side of the 
basement where the dishes are being washed. This is done 
by machinery. The plates, knives, forks, and spoons are 
put in wire baskets and dropped into a vat of boiling soap- 
suds, from which they come out clean and ready to dry. 
The drying is done by the heat which the plates get while 
in the water. This is so great that the moisture evaporates 
as soon as they are exposed to the air. 
We are now tired with our trip through the basement, 
and we go back tothe dining room. The waiter hands us 
the bill of fare and we begin to select the dishes we want, but 
are amazed at the prices. This is an expensive hotel, and 
one order of almost any sort of meat costs a dollar. We 
are therefore careful as to what we select. The portions 
are large, however, and as each is enough for several of 
our party we divide the orders among us and thus make 
out a good meal. When we have finished, the waiter 
hands us a bill on which is marked the price of each thing 
we have eaten, and we pay this before going out. 
Moving about through the hotel we are more and more 
surprised at its wonders. It has a safe for valuables, a 
bank at which one can have his checks cashed, barber 
shops for both men and women, and a photograph gallery. 
It has a news stand and a drug store, and places where 
they sell candy and flowers. 
In addition to the great hotels like this, there are thou- 
sands of smaller ones, including commercial hotels and 
those devoted to families. Every village has its home 
for the traveler, and there are hotels at the seashore, in the 
mountains, and at our winter resorts. Some of these are in 
use for only a few months of the year. .
-P-A-G-E-257
  
FIRE 257 
30. FIRE 
O-DAY we are again onthe wing. We have taken an 
airship and are sailing about over the earth, stopping 
now and then at the homes of some of our little brothers 
and sisters on other parts of the globe. We want to learn 
how the world’s houses are warmed and the many ways 
man has for cooking his food. To do this we shall first 
examine the heating arrangements of some far-away lands 
whose homes have less comforts and conveniences than 
ours. After that we shall look at the fires of colonial days, 
used by our ancestors when they were chopping their rude 
homes out of the woods, and then shall study our methods 
of heating to-day. 
But first let us ask what fire is, and how man learned te 
make it. These questions are hard ones to answer. The 
ancients believed fire to be one of the four elements of 
which, as they thought, all things were composed. These 
were earth, air, fire, and water. We now know that earth, 
air, and water are each made up of other elements or 
things, and that fire is the visible heat or light which comes 
from certain bodies in the process of combustion or 
burning. 
The ancient Greeks believed that fire came down from 
Heaven. Certain tribes of the Pacific Islands have a 
tradition that it was brought up from the lower regions 
where the great god, Maui, learned the secret of making it 
by rubbing two sticks together. Among the natives of 
the Tonga Islands the god of the earthquake is also the 
god of fire; and some of our Indians had a story that the 
first fire came to man from the buffaloes, which in gallop-

ing over the prairies set them ablaze by the sparks from 
their hoofs striking the rocks. The ancient Grecian tradi- 
tion is that Prometheus, one of the gods, stole fire from 
Heaven, brought it to earth in a hollow reed, and gave it 
toman. This made Jupiter, the chief of the gods, very 
angry and he condemned Prometheus to be chained to a 
rock on Mount Caucasus, where an eagle ate at his liver, 
which grew as fast as it was consumed and thus made his 
torment perpetual. The Greeks greatly honored Prome- 
theus. They had a temple in Athens where he was wor- 
shiped, and in celebration of his present of fire an annual 
festival was held, one of the features of which was a torch 
race from his altar to the city. 
The Scandinavian god, Thor, held a mallet in one hand 
and a flint in the other and with them made fire; while 
the ancient Peruvians believed that thunder and lightning 
came from one of their gods hurling stones with a sling. 
The Greeks called lightning flashes the thunderbolts of 
Jove, but the Peruvians thought they were the children 
of their god. 
But however fire first came to be known—whether it 
was from a volcano which overflowed and in blazing 
streams of molten lava ignited the forest, or whether 
from the lightning striking the dry grass or trees—man_ 
soon learned its great value and was able to produce it 
himself. There are many savage tribes in Africa who 
start their fires by rapidly whirling one stick around in 
a hole inside another. In this the friction makes the wood 
hotter and hotter and by and by it bursts into a_ blaze. 
The Indians of this continent were making fire in much the 
same way when our forefathers came. They also used
-P-A-G-E-260
  260 FIRE 
pieces of flint, which they struck upon other flint and thus 
got sparks which they caught on dry punk. This is still 
the custom among some of 
the tribes of Canada, the 
flints being an article of 
merchandise sold by the 
fur traders of the Hudson 
Bay Company. Our 
pioneer forefathers em- 
ployed flints to kindle their 
fires and to light the powder 
of their guns, and it is only of late years that man has 
had matches‘or percussion caps. As to the burning glass,

that was known to the Greeks —as we learn from the 
story of how Archimedes set fire to the ships of the enemy 
at Syracuse by using a mirror. Moreover, the Chinese 
are said to have used such glasses ages ago. 
Some nations have made fire an object of worship. The 
Persians did this, and also the Parsees, who are descended 
from them. The Parsees, who now live in India, have 
temples at Bombay in which are fires that are said to have 
been burning for hundreds of years. The Egyptians kept 
fires in their temples, as did the Romans in their Temple 
_ of Vesta, a. goddess who was represented by the holy flame. 
To-day fire is even more important to man than when 
he made it an object of worship. It not only lights and 
heats our houses, but, through the inventions connected 
with steam and electricity, moves the cars over the rail- 
roads and the steamships over the oceans. It forces the 
automobile to its speed of a mile or more a minute, and 
in flying machines enables us to go as swiftly as a bird

through the air. It gives us all kinds of manufactures. 
It is the father of iron and steel, and, in some way or 
other, is the most necessary servant of civilized man as to 
all that he eats, drinks, and wears, as well as to his various 
comforts and doings all the day through. 
Chemists tell us that fire is the rapid union of oxygen 
with other substances. When the union is gradual, we 
usually call it oxidation. Iron and oxygen unite and form 
iron rust, while hydrogen and oxygen unite and form the 
commonest of all substances, water. 
In this book, however, we are chiefly concerned with fire 
as it relates to warming and lighting man’s houses, and 
this alone is the object of our journey to-day. Our airship 
is ready to start. We get in and are soon high up in the 
clouds, flying at great speed towards the north. We shall 
visit the coldest lands first, warming our chilled blood at 
the fires of our Eskimo cousins. The winds aid the speed 
of our vessel. They shriek and whistle as they blow 
through its rigging, and the earth below seems to be mov- 
ing fast towards the south. Now we have crossed our 
northern boundary and are passing over British America. 
We are almost on the shores of the Arctic Ocean, when 
we drop down among a score of what at first seem small 
mounds of snow, but are really igloos or Eskimo homes. 
Each is a little domelike building made of blocks of ice 
so fitted together that it has the shape of half an egg- 
shell. Over the ice, snow has been spread, and the only 
entrance is by a hole in the ground. We leave the flying 
machine and crawl in, pulling our coats tight about our 
necks in order that the snow from over the doorway may 
not drop down our backs.
-P-A-G-E-263
FIRE 263 ‘ 
Now we are inside. The house is so low we can hardly 
stand upright. Only a moment ago Jack Frost seemed 
everywhere. He pinched our cheeks, bit our noses, and 
we had to rub our ears to keep them from freezing. In- 
side the igloo it is so warm that some of our Eskimo 
friends have almost no clothing. The heat comes from 
that lamp of fish oil which stands at one side of the room. 
See, the flame is melting the roof; its heat has cut its way 
between the ice blocks and made little chimneys, as it 
were, which, with the draft from the doorway, give the 
house a certain amount of fresh air. Oil is used here for 
fuel, and in this small dwelling a very little is enough to 
keep out the cold. 
We tarry awhile with our Eskimo friends and then fly 
on to the westward and drop down in Korea. Here the 
houses are largely composed of mud and stones, thatched 
with straw. We enter one, and are asked to take a seat on 
the floor. We do so, crossing our legs in Korean style. 
It was cold without, but it is warm and pleasant within, 
and we look about for the stove. There is none to be seen. 
After a time we grow uncomfortably warm, and, placing 
our hands on the floor, find it quite hot. It is covered 
with oiled paper stretched as tight as a drumhead, and it 
almost blisters our fingers. Upon our asking from whence 
the heat comes, the Koreans tell us that they have a net- 
work of flues under the floor, so made that when the fire is 
built in the kitchen the flames pass through them and heat 
the whole building. As we go out into the street we ob- 
serve the smoke pouring from a clay pipe which is fitted 
into the wall of the house at about the height of our waists 
from the ground. More smoke is coming from similar

pipes in the other houses near by. There is so much that 
it has turned the air blue. The village is cooking its sup- 
per, and at the same time warming up for the night. 
Crossing the Yellow Sea we travel among our slant-eyed 
little friends of northern China. Here the houses are 
heated in much the same way as in Korea, save that

the flues pass under the kang, a ledge about as high as 
a chair which fills one half of each room. These stove 
ledges are the sleeping and resting places of the family. 
They are heated chiefly by the fires used for cooking. 
In the larger houses there are similar arrangements which 
may be used for heating alone. 
With many of the Chinese, however, the cost of fuel is
-P-A-G-E-265
FIRE 265 
so great that they use only the surplus heat from the 
kitchen, relying upon clothing to keep themselves warm. 
Here in the north we see some who are dressed in furs, or 
in sheepskins with the wool turned inward. Farther south 
the people wear wadded cotton, putting on additional suits 
as the winter comes on. As the thermometer approaches 
zero they seem to fatten, and those who are naturally 
fleshy then grow so big, through their abundance of clothes, 
that it is almost impossible for them to pass through 
the doors of their homes. The little boys are so padded 
that they look more like balls than anything else, and 
should they fall down on the side of a hill, the chances are 
that snowball-like they would roll over and over, clear to the 
bottom. : 
We find the weather milder in Japan than it was in 
northern China, and the houses less tightly built. The 
thin walls slide in and out, and the air blows through the 
cracks. The buildings are made of wood and paper 
which quickly take fire, and hence kangs and flues are 
not safe. Most of the houses are poorly warmed by 
little fires of charcoal built in brass-bound boxes called 
hibachis, partly filled with ashes or earth. As winter comes 
on the people add more and more clothing, warming their 
feet and hands over these coals. There are no stoves to 
speak of, and only the palaces and large public buildings 
have heating plants. As we stand upon the hills to take 
a bird’s-eye view of a city we look in vain for the chimneys, 
so common to every American town. There are but few 
such in Japan, most of the cooking being done in square 
boxes of charcoal, at one end of which is a copper-lined fite 
hole. It is also done on little clay stoves. The water for   
 
-P-A-G-E-266
  266 FIRE 
bathing is heated by a charcoal fire built in a funnel- 
shaped stove in the back end of each bathtub. The stove 
has a pipe which passes up through the water, and makes 
it so hot that when 
we get into the tub 
we quickly jump out. 
Our skins are now 
as red as a lobster, 
fresh boiled. 
Every Japanese 
house has its bath- 
tub, and the larger ones have bathrooms. In all of the 
cities there are public bathhouses, where hundreds of men,

women, and children take a hot plunge every day. 
Our next stop is at the Philippine Islands. Here the 
cities have some large houses with stoves such as we have 
at home; but out in the country and in the villages, where 
the people live in houses of bamboo cane thatched with 
palm trees, the cooking is done in little clay stoves, which 
often rest upon a platform covered with earth. Sometimes 
such platforms are built under a shed or lean-to, adjoining 
the house. We are now in the tropics, and no heat is 
needed on account of the weather. | 
How would you like to live in a land where Mother 
Earth does the cooking; where, year in and year out, the 
boys do not need to bring in wood or kindle the fires; and 
where there are no ashes to carry away? This is the con- 
dition among certain tribes of Maoris whom we shall visit 
at their homes in northern New Zealand. We face our 
airship towards the southeast, across the Equator, and are 
soon soaring above the great island of New Guinea. We
-P-A-G-E-267
  FIRE 267 
then move on in the same direction over the Pacific Ocean 
and finally come to New Zealand. 
As we land we see steam coming out of the earth. 
There are great pools of boiling black mud here and there, 
and geysers are spurting showers of hot water and steam 
high into the air. We are in the hot springs region, not 
far south of Auckland, where in many places the steam is 
always pouring forth from the earth. The Maoris, who 
have built their log houses near by, cook their meals in 
the steam. They use wooden boxes open on top and 
having only a network of cords stretched over the bottom. 
They place their food on the net and cover it with a 
cloth. They now rest the box upon or in the steam 
hole, and the hot vapor cooks the food quite as well 
as that of our steam cookers at home. In this way 
the Maoris boil eggs and potatoes, and stew and boil 
meats; they even make puddings for their holiday feasts. 
Some of them are excellent cooks, and we delight in the 
meals we eat with them on the hillsides, taking the food 
hot from the box. . In this same region are many warm 
springs, where one can have a delightful bath at any 
hour of the day without the trouble of heating the water. 
Almost directly north of New Zealand are the Samoan 
Islands, where the weather is so warm that no heat is 
needed except for preparing the food. There and in 
others of the islands about the natives have no stoves, and 
they sometimes do their cooking by building fires in holes’ 
in the earth lined with stones. This makes the stones so 
hot that any food placed upon them is rapidly cooked. 
Such holes are also used as steam ovens. A whole pig 
may be roasted, or meats and vegetables placed there in
-P-A-G-E-268
  268 FIRE 
layers and covered with grass or green leaves. After 
that some earth is spread over the top and a little water 
poured in; or the steam from the leaves and the vege- 
tables may suffice for the cooking. We taste some of 
the food prepared in this way. It is so delicious that we 
decide to make an oven ourselves the next time we go 
fishing or picnicking at home. 
Leaving the South Seas we journey on to other parts 
of Asia and Africa, finding strange fire-making methods 
among the wild peoples. In Africa much of the cooking 
is done out of doors. Jn India, as we have seen, the chief 
fuel is the manure of cattle mixed with earth. 
We now go to Europe, where fuel is more plentiful and 
the houses are warmed much like our own.’ We begin our 
travels in the great empire of Russia. This is a cold 
country, in parts of which it is winter for five or six 
months of the year. The houses are large, and those of 
the rich are heated with great stoves of porcelain built 
at one side or in a corner of each room. Every stove has 
many chambers inside it, and it is so easily heated that a 
comparatively small amount of fuel will keep warm a large 
room. On account of the severity of their winters, the 
Russians build thick walls for their houses, and fit them 
with double windows and doors. 
The poorer people live in log huts thatched with straw. 
Their chief fuel is wood, and as in China the fires used for 
cooking serve also for warming the house. The stove of 
the peasant home is usually connected with a great chim- 
ney which takes up one side of the living room. Out 
of this chimney wall a ledge is made in such a way 
that the fire runs under it, keeping it warm. This ledge
-P-A-G-E-269
  
5 FIRE 269 
usually forms the common sleeping place of the family, 
where the father and mother, brothers and sisters, grown- 
ups and children all sleep at night, as it were, on the top 
of the stove. 
  “‘The father and mother, brothers and sisters, grown-ups and children all 
sleep at night, as it were, on the top of the stove.” 
One feature of every Russian village is the bathhouse, 
a large building or steam oven in which the people go for 
baths. They think it is desirable to perspire a great deal, 
and sometimes whip themselves with twigs to make the 
sweat come. 
Crossing over to Germany, we travel through the various 
countries of North Europe, where the climate is much like 
our own. Here the people have stoves and grates, and 
the larger houses are often heated by steam or hot water. 
The German stoves are usually of brick and porcelain 
made like those of the Russians. They have also stoves 
of iron, cast into shapes similar to those of our country.

As we go southward the heating arrangements are 
poorer, and in the lands along the Mediterranean we find 
ourselves suffering more from the cold than in Sweden 
and Norway, where the weather is bitter cold a great part 
of the winter. The 
reason is that the 
homes of southern 
Europe are by no 
means well heated. 
The summers are 
long, and even in 
winter it is compara- 
tively warm in the 
sun, although chilly 
inside and quite cold 
at night. 
We find, however, 
that the methods of 
heating of nearly every locality vary with the fuel near by. 
Europe has a great deal of coal, and this is especially so 
in England, where the houses are warmed much like our 
own. Germany and Ireland have vast beds of peat, a fuel 
which might be called unripe coal. It is usually found 
in low, swampy land. It is dug out and laid upon the 
firm ground to dry. It burns with a dull glow, and gives 
out a great heat.

Of the whole world, however, there is no country which 
has more or better fuel of all kinds than our own, and none 
which has so many inventions for warming its homes. As

31. WARMING OUR HOMES — FIREPLACES, 
STOVES, HOT WATER, AND STEAM 
HE delightful fires of colonial days are well described 
by Whittier in his beautiful poem “Snow-bound,” 
which I advise every one of our party to read. It pictures 
the home life of New England in the depths of mid-winter, 
when the whole family gathered around the great open 
fireplace and cracked nuts and ate the apples they roasted 
over the coals. 
“Shut in from all the world without, 
We sat the clean-winged hearth about, 
Content to let the north wind roar 
In baffled rage at pane and door, 
While the red logs before us beat 
The frost line back with tropic heat ; 
And ever, when a louder blast 
Shook beam and rafter as it passed, 
The merrier up its roaring draught 
The great throat of the chimney laughed.” 
This is followed by a picture of the scenes about the 
fire:— 
“The house dog on his paws outspread 
Laid to the fire his drowsy head ; 
The cat’s dark silhouette on the wall 
A couchant tiger’s seemed to fall ; 
And, for the winter fireside meet, 
Between the andirons’ straddling feet, 
The mug of cider simmered slow, 
The apples sputtered in a row, 
And, close at hand, the basket stood 
With nuts from brown October’s wood. 
What matter how the night behaved? 
What matter how the north wind raved? 
Blow high, blow low, not all its snow 
Could quench our hearth fire’s ruddy glow.”
-P-A-G-E-272
  272 WARMING OUR HOMES ’ 
In another place in the same poem, Whittier tells how 
the fire was laid: — 
“We piled, with care, our nightly stack 
Of wood against the chimney back— 
The oaken log, green, huge, and thick, 
And on its top the stout back stick ; 
The knotty fore stick laid apart, 
And filled between with curious art 
The ragged brush ; then, hovering near, 
We watched the first red blaze appear, 
Heard the sharp crackle, caught the gleam 
On whitewashed wall and sagging beam, 
Until the old, rude-furnished room 
Burst, flowerlike, into rosy bloom.” 
Such fireplaces were common in our colonial times. 
Then every family had more wood than it could use, and 
fuel cost comparatively nothing. To-day the great fire- 
place is to be found only in our forest regions, or on 
the farms where wood is still plentiful. In'most localities, 
however, the colonial fireplace, so large that whole logs 
were rolled into it, 
has disappeared and 
in its stead we have 
our boxlike stoves 
for wood, the base 
burners which eat 
anthracite coal, the 
petty grate, the hot 
air furnace, and, the 
radiator or coil of 
pipes filled with 
steam or hot water from a boiler in the cellar below. 
These and other inventions have given us much better and

cheaper arrangements for warming our homes; but at the 
same time we long for the delights of the firepiaces of the 
past, and wish we could be back at the hearths of our fore- 
fathers roasting potatoes in the ashes or popping corn over 
the coals. 
The change from the fireplace to the stove, the furnace, 
and the hot water plant has come, as far as the practical 
use of these things is concerned, within the past century. 
  Furnace room. 
Stoves of cast iron were first made at about the time 
Columbus discovered America, but they were not in general 
use until centuries later. In 1744 Benjamin Franklin 
made an iron lining for a fireplace which threw the heat 
out into the room, and a little later he invented a box stove 
of cast iron for the burning of wood. Shortly after the 
beginning of the last century, stoves, with drums in the 
rooms overhead, were employed by the Pennsylvania Ger-

mans, and at an early time cast-iron boxes were built 
along one side of a fireplace so that the other end of the 
' box projected into a room in the rear, thus heating that 
room. 
  Bedroom with radiator. 
In those times churches were not heated, and eath per- 
son had a little box stove which he took with him to 
keep his feet warm. These foot stoves were sheet-iron 
pans about six inches square in which live coals were 
placed. The pans were inclosed in casings of metal with 
holes in the top and bottom; and they had handles by

  276 WARMING OUR HOMES 
which they were carried. Stoves of sheet iron were made 
in Philadelphia along about 1800; and our first base burners 
were sold about thirty years later. 
Our pioneer mothers cooked most of their food in pots 
and kettles hung by hooks or cranes over the coals of 
the fireplace. They baked their potatoes in the hot ashes, 
and sometimes had a brick oven built alongside the fireplace 
with an iron door leading into it. On baking day a wood 
fire. was started inside the oven, and when it was thor- 
oughly hot the coals were removed and bread placed on 
the brick floor. The first cooking stove probably came from 
making an oven in a box stove, after which the modern 
stove and range with the holes upon top and ovens at the 
sides or overhead were invented. 
As to the furnaces which give us hot air, steam, and hot 
water, they are now,more and more used. The hot air 
furnace consists of a compartment containing a fire and of 
iron walls so built about it and so closed in that the air 
which enters from outdoors through a flue passes between 
the fire compartment and the walls. It is thus warmed, 
and is then conducted to the various rooms of the buildings 
with which the furnace is connected by means of pipes or 
flues. The smoke is taken off through a pipe which con- 
nects with the fire only and is joined to the chimney. The 
heating pipes pass up inside the walls of the house, and 
the hot air is admitted to the various rooms through open- 
ings called registers. 
It is strange that hot water should have been used for 
heating long before inventions were made for using hot 
air. Seneca tells us that the baths at Rome were heated 
from a coil of brass water pipes around which fires were
-P-A-G-E-277
    
WARMING OUR HOMES 277 
built; and we know that a Frenchman employed such 
heating for hatching chickens, and that an Englishman 
heated his conservatories in a similar way generations 
ago. 
The first steam-heating plant used in America was brought 
over from England in 1842 by Joseph Nason, and it was 
several years later that Nason used small wrought-iron 
pipes about three quarters of an inch thick for warming 
buildings with steam. The first two steam-heating plants 
used in our country were in the Eastern Hotel of Boston, 
and in a woolen miil at Burlington, Vermont. 
Since then many improvements have been made in house 
warming, and it is now possible to heat any kind of a 
building by steam or hot water. In such plants the fuel 
is consumed in a furnace in the basement, connected with 
which is a boiler for heating the water or making the 
steam. From the boiler iron pipes carrying the hot water 
or steam are run through the building. They are con- 
nected with radiators in each room, the amount of heat 
being determined by the size and number of the radiators. 
The heat may be regulated by the amount of fire under 
the boiler, and also by the valve which lets the water or 
* steam into each radiator. 
In some cases several houses may be heated from one 
central plant, the steam or hot water being conveyed from 
the boilers in the central station to the various buildings 
through underground pipes. 
Among other methods of heating and cooking are those 
connected with gas and electricity. In most places these 
are too costly to be used for warming the house, although 
in and near the natural gas fields many villages and some
-P-A-G-E-278
  278 LIGHTING THE HOUSE 
quite large towns are heated by pipes from the gas wells. 
The pipes are run through the houses, being connected 
with the stoves, grates, or fireplaces. When heat is needed 
it is only necessary to put a lighted taper near the open- 
ings of the pipes, and to turn the valve which admits the 
gas. After this it will burn until it is turned off, and at 
the end there are no ashes to be taken away. 
In such fires the grates are often filled with slag, fire 
brick, or other materials which, being made hot by the 
flames, look like real coals. The imitation logs of clay or 
iron used in the fireplace seem to be blazing wood; while 
sometimes the gas plays over asbestos, making us think of 
sheets of gold leaf burning away. In many cities artificial 
gas from the public gas works is so used, and in most of 
the apartment houses the cooking is done on gas stoves.

32. LIGHTING THE HOUSE 
EFORE we examine the wonders of petroleum, gas, 
and electricity, let us take a look into the past and 
see how our forefathers lighted their houses. You may 
have read how Abraham Lincoln, when he was a boy 
of ten or twelve, read ‘‘AEsop’s Fables,” “ Robinson Crusoe,” 
and “ Pilgrim’s Progress” by the light of the pine knots in the 
fireplace of his log cabin home. The pine knot was one 
of the favorite lights of our colonial days. It was some- 
times called the pine torch. It was found almost every- 
where in the forest. It was burned on a flat stone placed 
in a corner of the fireplace in order that the dense smoke 
from it might go up the chimney. 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
        LIGHTING THE HOUSE 279 
In those times candles were almost universally used. 
They were made of beef tallow, and also of a wax from 
the berries of the bayberry bush. Nearly every family 
made its own candles, and all saved for this purpose the 
tallow from the beef which they ate. Making the candles 
for the winter was a special occasion which consumed one 
  
  
    
Candle dipping. 
or two days every autumn. At that time the tallow was 
melted in a great kettle over a fire outside the house. 
Then two poles were supported on the backs of chairs 
and upon them the candle rods, small sticks about eighteen 
inches long to which wicks were attached, were placed. 
In making the candles the rod with its row of wicks was 
dipped into the kettle. The tallow stuck to the wicks. It
-P-A-G-E-280
      280 LIGHTING THE HOUSE 
soon hardened, and by dipping again and again each of 
the wicks was surrounded by enough tallow to become a 
candle of the right size. This work was slow, about two 
hundred candles being all that one person could possibly 
make in a day. In other places the candles were made 
by running the tallow into molds consisting of groups 
of tin or pewter pipes 
through which the wicks 
ran. There were candle 
makers who went from 
house to house carrying 
such molds, and making 
the candles for the 
family at so much per 
dozen or pound. 
Another light much 
used in colonial times came from the oil which was brought 
by the whalers of New England from ‘the waters about 
Greenland and other cold seas. The whales they caught 
were frequently from sixty to one hundred feet long and Candle molds. 
some weighed as much as two hundred oxen. The oil 
came from the blubber or fat of the whale, of which there 
was a yellowish white mass under the skin ranging in 
thickness from eight to twenty inches. After harpooning 
the whale and killing it, the men cut off this blubber in 
large pieces and packed it away in the holds of the vessels 
and thus brought it home. The blubber was melted and 
skimmed, and the oil therefrom was burned in rude lamps 
of pewter and glass. 
If we could take a rapid trip around the world, we 
might find many people still using lights like those our
-P-A-G-E-281
    
LIGHTING THE HOUSE 281 
forefathers had. In the wilds of Africa are tribes which 
rely upon burning wood or palm nuts for their light, and 
among the Eskimos fish oil is commonly used. There 
is said to be one fish in Alaska which contains so much 
oil that, when caught and'killed, one may sink a wick into 
its back, and when lighted the fish will burn like a candle. 
In China there is a certain tree called the candle tree, 
the wax from the leaves of which can be burned, and in 
Brazil grows a palm tree known as the carnauba, whose 
leaves furnish a wax which is made into candles and used 
to the extent of several million pounds every year. In 
some countries coconut oil is used for lighting, and in 
others olive oil is employed the same way. 
Candles still form the chief light of many lands. They 
are used largely in Europe and Asia, and the United States 
has great establishments which are kept busy manufactur- 
ing them for our home market. There is a candle factory 
at Cincinnati which makes one hundred thousand a day; 
so many that if they were all molded into one candle of the 
usual thickness, it would be thirteen miles long. 
It seems strange that man should have kept on for 
centuries using such lights as we have described, while all 
the time Nature was telling him that she had stored under- 
ground vast quantities of oil which would burn better and 
furnish more light than anything he had yet been able to 
make. Five hundred years before Christ, Herodotus wrote 
of oil wells on the Island of Zante; and during the Middle 
Ages, Marco Polo, a celebrated traveler, told how he saw 
oil from near the Caspian Sea carried on camels through 
Asia. At about the same time petroleum taken from the 
surface of a lake in Bohemia was being sold as a medi-
-P-A-G-E-282
282 LIGHTING THE HOUSE 
cine; and a legend is still current in the Russian oil terri- 
tory that Alexander the Great while traveling through 
there killed a boy by drenching him with burning water. 
In our own country, the oil coming out on the surface of 
the earth had been set on fire long before the first oil well 
was dug; and natural gas was lighted many years before 
any one thought of bringing it into our homes. 
  
    
Scene in the Texas oil regions. 
To-day the greater part of the artificial light used by 
man comes from petroleum. The amount taken from the 
ground every year is several hundred million barrels, or 
enough, if it were equally divided, to give more than thirty 
gallons to every family on earth. The places from which 
coal oil comes aré widely scattered, and new fields are 
being discovered from year to year. Most of the product 
is now from Russia and the United States, more than half 
of all the oil raised coming from our own continent. 
The Russian oil fields are at the eastern end of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-283
  LIGHTING THE HOUSE 283 
Caucasus Mountains, on the shores of the Caspian Sea, 
-and Europe has other fields in Austria and Roumania. 
There are extensive petroleum beds in Burma, and in the 
islands of Borneo, Java, and Sumatra. There are also oil 
fields in northwestern Mexico not far from the boundary 
of the United States, and in Canada and Alaska. There 
are some in Africa, Australasia, South America, and in 
China and Japan. Our oil fields lie chiefly along the 
western slope of the Appalachian range in New York, 
Pennsylvania, and Virginia, in the basin of the Ohio River 
in Ohio and Indiana, Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas, and 
also in southern California. In all of these places a great 
deal of oil is produced, and the product from them not only 
lights the most of the United States, but it drives the dark- 
ness from the homes of many people of every country of 
the world. 
But what is the origin of petroleum, and how is it got 
out of the earth? 
The first question is a difficult one, and scientists, who 
have studied as to how the world is made, answer it in 
different ways. Some say that it is altogether a mineral, 
and that it comes from the action of steam and carbon on 
certain metals which form a large part of the earth. 
Others suppose that it has come from the action of water 
on metals, and others that it has resulted through the de- 
cay of the countless plants and animals which swarmed 
the seas before the age at which coal was formed. They 
suppose that these plants and animals were in some way 
shut in under layers of rock, so dense that the air could not 
get to them, and that they decayed and formed this gas 
and oil. :
-P-A-G-E-284
284 LIGHTING THE HOUSE 
Now there are many kinds of 
rock, such as the sandstones, 
limestones, and others, the grains 
of which are not very close to- 
gether, and other rock, such as 
slate, whose grains or particles 
are so compact and tight that 
neither oil nor gas can pass 
through them. The scientists 
think that the oil and gas were 
soaked up by these great beds 
of porous rock just as water is 
soaked up by a sponge, and that 
they are held there by the tight 
rock above, below, and around 
them. They are inclosed, as it 
were, in a prison, until man by 
boring through the tight rock 
lets them loose. In such prisons 
  there is usually a brine at the 
bottom, with oil above, and per- 
haps gas upon top. When the 
roof of the prison is broken the 
gas and oil rush with great force 
to the surface, or, where the 
pressure is not so great, the oil 
is drawn up by pumps. 
* Petroleum rushes forth, spout- The pressure of these earth- 
ing high into the air.”   prisons varies in different places. 
Sometimes there is so much oil in the rock, and it is so 
squeezed within its prison walls, that when the hole is

  LIGHTING THE HOUSE 285 
made the petroleum rushes forth, spouting high into the 
air and flowing for days and weeks before it stops. 
In the Russian oil fields some wells have been dug 
which spouted from sixty to one hundred thousand bar- 
rels a day, and in Texas a single well poured out four hun- 
dred thousand barrels of oil, covering the ground about 
and forming creeks of oil several miles long, before its 
force could be checked and the oil saved. The “Star 
and Crescent,” another Texas well, threw a stream of oil 
six inches thick as high as a twelve story house, and this 
continued for several days before a cap could be put over 
the pipe, and arrangements made for saving the oil. One 
Russian well wasted a hundred thousand tons of oil before 
it could be capped, and another sent up a column of petro- 
leum two hundred feet high, which ran off and formed a 
little oil lake near by. Another spouted forth sand and 
oil to a height of four hundred feet; and upon the pipe 
of a fourth a plate of cast iron weighing twenty-two tons 
was laid, but the stream of petroleum threw it aside as 
though it were paper. 
In most of the oil beds the pressure is slight in compari- 
son with that which produces these great spouters or gush- 
ers, as they are called. Some wells may not flow at all, and 
some yield only a few barrels per day, requiring pumps to 
raise the oil to the surface. Others flow steadily for weeks 
and months and then gradually diminish, after which the 
pumps are put in. 
Some of the oil territories have continued to produce oil 
a long time, and in the oldest of them excellent new wells 
are occasionally found. In others the great flow is soon 
exhausted, and it becomes less every year.

286 OUR GREAT OIL INDUSTRY 
33. OUR GREAT OIL INDUSTRY 
HE first mention made of petroleum on our continent 
was by a French missionary in 1635, only fifteen years 
after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth. He had visited the 
region under the surface of which the great oil deposits of 
western Pennsylvania lie, and he wrote of springs and 
streams coated with oil. Later the early settlers of Penn- 
sylvania collected the oil for medicine. This was also 
done by the Seneca Indians, who laid blankets upon the 
ponds and streams and thus soaked up the petroleum, 
which they wrung out and sold. After a long time it 
occurred to some that if there was so much oil on the sur- 
face more might be found farther down, and in 1854 the 
Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company sunk a well which 
yielded from four hundred to one thousand barrels of oil a 
day. For some reason, however, this was abandoned; and 
it was not until five years later that the well was sunk 
which formed the beginning of our oil industry. This was 
after it was discovered that the oil could be refined and 
used for lighting. Then E. L. Drake dug a well near 
Titusville, Pennsylvania, and at seventy feet struck oil. 
The yield was not large. The well produced only a few 
barrels a day, but it showed the people that the oil could 
be raised and other wells were rapidly sunk. 
From then on the borings grew deeper and the Empire 
well was put down, It yielded twenty-five hundred barrels 
a day, and a month later the Phillips well was producing 
three thousand barrels. By this time people were almost 
crazy over the fortunes to be made from petroleum. Hun- 
dreds of wells were sunk, and new oil fields discovered. 
   
-P-A-G-E-287
  OUR GREAT OIL INDUSTRY 287 
The miners bored their wells deeper and deeper, and some 
of the richest deposits were found at two or three thousand 
and more feet below the ground. So much oil was pro- 
duced that it was difficult to take care of it. Great iron 
tanks, each holding from twenty to forty thousand barrels, 
were erected in the oil territory, and pipes were laid from 
them to all parts of the fields to bring in the oil. 
  
    
Oil refinery. 
As time went on more and more tanks were built, and 
tank cars were constructed for carrying the oil. Then the 
pipes were laid to Cleveland and other cities, where works 
were erected for refining petroleum, and in time extended, 
over the Appalachian Mountains, to the seacoast, so that 
the oil from the wells could be pumped there. We have now 
tens of thousands of miles of iron-pipe connecting our chief 
oil territories with the seaboard, the markets, and the works 
where the oil is refined. The pipe lines of Pennsylvania

alone if they were placed end to end would reach around 
the world; and there are other extensive piping systems in 
West Virginia, Ohio, California, Texas, and wherever oil is 
mined in large quantities. These pipes are of wrought iron. 
They are from four to eight inches in diameter and are 
usually laid two or three feet underground. There are 
pumping stations and storage tanks at every thirty miles 
along their course; or such stations may be placed other- 
wheres on the hills or where it is necessary to raise the oil, 
as it travels over the country. 
  Storage tank for oil. 
The transportation of American oil to the homes of the 
other continents is also a great industry. It is now taken 
over the oceans in tank steamers, one of which, suchas the 
Andromeda, will carry more than six hundred and eighty 
thousand gallons at a load. The oil is pumped into the 
hold of the steamer as it lies at our wharves, and remains 
there until it is pumped out again into the great storage
-P-A-G-E-289
  OUR GREAT OIL INDUSTRY 289 
tanks at some seaport of Europe, Africa, Asia, South 
America, or Australia. 
There is a great difference in crude petroleum as it 
comes from the earth. Some has been found which could 
be used for lighting without refining, but this is uncommon. 
Most’ of it is thick and dark colored, and it all contains 
materials which must be separated from that part of it 
which we use in our lamps. The crude oil differs also as 
to the field whence it comes. That of Pennsylvania, New 
York, and West Virginia is light amber in color, and is 
easily refined, while that of the Ohio and Indiana fields is 
darker and heavier and it contains considerable sulphur. 
The Kansas and Texas oils are still darker and heavier; 
and they, like the California oils, are being largely used as 
fuel on the railroad locomotives and for factories. The 
latter oils are less easily refined; they have a disagreeable 
odor, and, barrel for barrel, are not so valuable as some 
other oils. 
But now let us see how the crude oil is treated to prepare 
it for lighting our homes. As it flows from the wells it is 
thick and dirty, and mixed with sand and water. It may 
be of a light yellow color or dark green, brown, or black. 
Its smell is offensive, and, if burnt, the odor might drive us 
out of our houses. All this must be changed before it is 
ready for use. In addition to the oil for lighting, about 
two hundred other products are made from crude petro- 
leum, so that it must contain many substances of various 
kinds. 
The crude oil first goes to the storage tanks, where the 
sand and water in it gradually sink to the bottom. It is 
then pumped through pipes to the tanks of the refinery, 
CARP, HOUSES — 19
-P-A-G-E-290
290 OUR GREAT OIL INDUSTRY 
which has many iron stills, furnaces, and other machinery. 
The oil is put into the stills and cooked, as it were, just the 
right amount of heat being supplied. As it grows warmer 
and warmer, the lighter particles rise in a vapor and pass 
out into coils of pipe, kept cold by running them through 
troughs in which cold water flows, or by their being’set in 
cold water tanks. As the vapor strikes the cold surface of 
the pipes, it condenses and flows out at the other end of 
the coil in a stream of pure oil. This stream is very light 
and thin at the start, but it grows thicker and heavier as 
more heat is applied to the still. The first oil that comes 
out is benzine or crude naphtha, and the next, a little heavier, 
is the kerosene we use in our lamps. After that, with more 
heat, come the thicker, illuminating oils, leaving in the still 
a heavy, dark fluid from which lubricating oils, paraffin, and 
coke are made. 
The kerosene is sometimes washed with acid and soda, 
and is sprayed through the air and treated in other ways 
to further purify it, in order that there may be no explosive 
gas left in it. It is important that it should not ignite too 
easily, and that its flashing and burning points should be high. 
By the flashing point is meant the lowest temperature at 
which the oil will give off a vapor which will flash or ex- 
plode when a flame is brought near its surface. If this is 
not right, the lamp or can in which the oil is may burst, 
like a cannon, or break out in flames. If the burning point 
is too low, it may ignite before we expect it to do so. For 
this reason there are in some parts of our country laws 
which require all kerosene to be tested as to the degree of 
heat at which it will flash or burn; if that degree is too 
low, it must not be sold.

HOW GAS IS MADE 291 
34. HOW GAS IS MADE 
HE path along which we shall travel this morning is 
lighted by rays from water and stone. It seems 
strange to draw light from such things, but the world has 
many cities and towns which are lighted by gas made 
from coal, which is one form of stone, and from water, 
which is composed of two elements, hydrogen and oxygen. 
The hydrogen, when separated from the oxygen and ig- 
nited, burns with a hot, colorless flame. 
Of these two gases, that from coal was first used. It 
is said to have been discovered about two hundred years 
ago by John Clayton, a bishop of Cork, in Ireland, who 
made it by distilling soft coal and catching the gas in a 
bladder. He had no idea of using it for house lighting, 
but looked upon it merely as a curiosity for entertaining his 
friends. He would take the bladder of gas and place it near 
the flame of a candle. He would then prick a hole with a 
needle or pin, and the gas, coming out, would take fire and 
continue to burn until all was consumed. The people were 
much surprised at this sight, because they could see no 
difference between the bladder used by the bishop and 
one filled with air. 
It is said that the great Dr. Johnson, the man who 
wrote “Rasselas,” once prophesied that London would ‘be 
lighted by gas. He had seen a man climb a ladder to 
light one of the oil lamps then used for the streets. The 
lamp had just gone out, and Dr. Johnson noticed that the 
wick caught in a moment from the vapor or gas still rising 
from it. “Ah!” said he, “the day may yet come when 
London will be lighted by smoke.”
-P-A-G-E-292
292 HOW GAS IS MADE 
That remark of the learned doctor was uttered in the 
latter part of the eighteenth century. It was not long 
thereafter that a company was established for putting gas 
lamps upon the streets of London, and Paris was so lighted 
in 1820. Inour own country Baltimore began to light its 
streets with gas in 1821, and Boston the year after that. 
The first man who is known to have used coal gas for 
house lighting was a Scotchman named Murdock. He 
introduced such gas into his own home in 1792, and soon 
afterwards into some cotton mills at Manchester, England. 
But where did man get the idea that gas could be made 
out of coal? It may have come from watching a fire of 
soft coal where the fuel sometimes melts to pitch, giving 
forth a gas which bursts into flame. We may see that 
in almost any fire of bituminous coal as it burns in our 
grates. We can also test for ourselves the fact that there 
is gasin the coal. All we have to do is to fill the bowl of 
a clay pipe with coal dust and cover the top tight with 
clay. We can then put the bowl in the fire, leaving the 
stem sticking out. Within a short time the heat will drive 
the gas out of the coal and it will come through the stem 
in a thin stream which a match will turn into flame. It is 
after this principle that all coal gas is made. 
But we can see the chief processes of manufacturing 
this light from coal and water by visiting the gas works 
of any large city. Suppose we take those of Washington, 
the capital of our nation. They supply much of the light 
for more than seventy thousand houses, and some for the 
White House, the Treasury, and the Capitol Building, 
although the latter places have electric lights as well. 
The Washington Gas Works are situated near the banks

of the Potomac River, not more than a mile west of the 
Executive Mansion, where our President lives. They con-

retorts, massive iron boxes, and other machinery for mak- 
ing the gas and also for purifying it so that it will furnish 
a clear and bright light; for according to law it must be

twenty times as bright as a candle: Outside the buildings 
rise the mighty round tanks or towers for storing the gas 
until needed. They remind us of the petroleum tanks we 
saw in the oil fields, save that they are fitted into a frame- 
work so that they move up and down in great pits of 
water. Each tower has a diameter equal to that of the 
largest circus tent, and at the time of our visit some are as 
high as a.ten-story house. Others are shorter, and the 
men tell us they rise or descend as the gas goes in or out.  
-P-A-G-E-294
204 , HOW GAS IS MADE 
We smell the gas long before we get to the works. The 
air has an offensive odor, and we wonder whether it will 
be dangerous for us to go in. We first visit that part 
of the establishment where the coal gas is made. At 
one side of it is the coal shed, an enormous building which 
will hold fifty thousand tons at one time. It is half full of 
soft or bituminous coal, for that is the kind used for coal 
gas. The men are wheeling it in iron cars across the way 
to the building containing the furnaces and retorts, where 
it will be cooked until all the gas has gone out. 
We follow them and are led into a large room almost 
filled with what looks like a series of furnaces, each entered 
by a round iron door above which is an iron pipe as thick 
as a telegraph pole running up to its top. These are the 
retorts. Each consists of a huge, box-shaped vessel lined 
with fire clay in which the soft coal is cooked, the gas pass- 
ing off through the pipe. There at one end we can see the 
men putting coal in, They load the black lumps into nar- 
row iron troughs about eight feet in length and shove them 
in through the round, cast-iron doors. As they do so the 
flames stream forth, and, looking in through the doors, we 
can see the coal blazing away. In addition to its own 
heat each retort has that of a coke furnace beneath it, and 
the temperature is now about two thousand degrees Fah- 
renheit, or almost ten times that at which water boils. Now, 
the men have shut the doors and screwed them so tight 
that not a bit of gas can come out. The heat is melting 
the coal, and the gas is going up the pipe to the top of the 
retorts and from there into other pipes which carry it off 
to be purified. 
Now let us take a lump of coal from those they are
-P-A-G-E-295
  HOW GAS IS MADE 295 
throwing into the furnace and examine it. It seems 
typical of darkness rather than light. It is black, heavy, 
and solid, and it seems almost greasy. It is not at all like 
this piece of coke which one of the men brings to show us 
how it will look after the cooking. The coke is light and 
spongy, and its color is the gray of pig iron. The coal as 
it goes into the furnace contains, not only the coke and 
gas, but also tar, ammonia, sulphur, and other impurities. 
All of these materials, excepting the coke, are mixed with 
the gas when it flows up the pipes from the retort, and 
they must all be taken out of it before it can be used. 
This is done by forcing the gas through certain substances. 
It first goes through water, where the greater part of the 
tar and oily parts condense and some of the ammonia is 
washed out and afterward saved. It is then whirled round 
and round by fans which, as they revolve, dip into water 
and thus scrub the gas much as clothes are cleaned in a 
washing machine. It is by such means that most of the 
impurities are removed. 
There are some impurities, however, which require fur- 
ther treatment. One of these is sulphur, which gives the 
gas a bad smell not unlike that of bad eggs. In some works 
this is taken out by running the gas through beds of pow- 
dered lime. Here at Washington it is done by passing it 
slowly through great iron boxes in the bottom of which are 
iron borings or filings, mixed with shavings of white pine. 
The shavings are used to keep the bits of iron apart, and 
to allow the gas to come into contact with them. Other- 
wise they would all sink together into a solid bed at the 
bottom of the box. As the gas goes through this mixture, 
the sulphur in it sticks to the iron, and after a time it has 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
  
296 HOW GAS IS MADE 
all gone out of the gas. Other things are taken out in 
various ways, and at the end the gas is comparatively pure. 
It is now ready to be taken off into the great towerlike 
tanks, which, as we have seen, store the gas until it is used. 
As we walk through the works we ask the men how 
they measure the gas, and they show us the big meters, 
~ each of which on a dial records the hundreds of thousands 
of cubic feet of gas which pass through. They tell us that 
the cubic foot is the unit of measurement, and that gas is 
of value according to the lighting power it possesses. The 
standard is the light of a candle, of a certain weight, burn- 
ing at a fixed rate per hour. Ordinary coal gas has seldom 
more than sixteen candle power. This is not as much as 
the laws of the District of Columbia require, and the coal 
gas is therefore enriched with petroleum vapor, which in- 
creases lighting power. 
The men say that one ton of soft coal should furnish 
about ten thousand feet of sixteen candle power gas, and 
that in addition it contains fourteen hundred pounds of 
coke, one hundred and twenty pounds of gas tar, and 
about twenty gallons of impure liquid ammonia. We col- 
lect specimens of the coal, coke, and tar, and of the other 
impurities for our museums, as we go through the works. 
Leaving the department where this coal gas is made, we 
move on to the building where they are so treating water 
that it will burn and give forth a bright light. Is it not 
strange that we can make water burn? We have always 
considered it the opposite of fire and have employed it in 
extinguishing flames of all kinds. But there is no end to 
the wonders of chemistry. By a process which in princi- 
ple is somewhat like smelting, some of the oxygen of water
-P-A-G-E-297
  HOW GAS IS MADE 207 
can be removed, leaving a gas that will burn. It will not, 
however, give a good light without the addition of carbon, 
and this is supplied by adding petroleum vapor. In mak- 
ing water gas, steam is passed over coal raised to a white 
heat. Some of the oxygen of the steam unites with the 
coal and a mixture of partly burned carbon and hydrogen, 
  One of these tanks will hold one million cubic feet of gas. 
  called water gas, is formed. At the same time a small 
stream of oil is let in. This combines with the water gas, 
forming the rich illuminating gas used in most of our cities. 
This gas is also purified, being washed and scrubbed just 
like the gas we saw made from soft coal. It requires about 
fifty pounds of coal and four or five gallons of oil to make 
one thousand cubic feet of such gas. 
In Washington city the water gas from anthracite, 
naphtha, and water is mixed with that from bituminous
-P-A-G-E-298
298 HOW GAS IS MADE 
coal before it is sent through the pipes to the homes of the 
people. Some other cities use water gas only, and in a 
few coal gas alone is consumed. All such gas is carried 
from the works through pipes to the gas towers or storage 
tanks, and is there kept and let out into the pipes of the 
city as the demands of the people require. 
One object of these storage tanks is to force the gas into 
the homes of the consumers. Each tower is constructed 
in sections which fit together much like the rings of a tele- 
scope, and it is crowned with a gigantic inverted cup. The 
sections are so arranged that the gas cannot escape, and so 
that the walls and top will rise as the gas flows in. There 
is water in the bottom of the tank. The gas enters through 
a pipe at one side and passes out through a pipe at the 
other, being controlled by a governor which allows it to go 
just so fast and no faster. One of the tanks of the Wash- 
ington plant will hold a million cubic feet of gas, and there 
is one in London that will hold twelve times that amount. 
The gas is carried through the city in large iron pipes 
_ or mains laid under the streets, and it is taken from them 
into the houses through smailer pipes which connect by 
others, still smaller, in their walls, with branch pipes and 
brackets extending out into the rooms. 
In addition to gas made in these ways, we have natural 
gas from the same source as petroleum; oil gas from petro- 
leum, tar, and shale oil; air gas, produced by causing air 
to pass through the lightest of the petroleum vapors; and 
acetylene gas. None of these gases, however, is used to 
anything like the extent of coal gas or water gas, although 
acetylene is often employed for houses which stand alone 
in the country, and for villages and small towns.
-P-A-G-E-299
  LIGHTING BY ELECTRICITY : 299 
Acetylene gas is made by adding water to calcium car- 
bide, a material formed by heating coke powder and lime 
in an electric furnace. This is of such a nature that when 
water drops on it a gas arises which when ignited, gives a 
pure, clear, and very bright light.

35. LIGHTING BY ELECTRICITY 
N one of the fairy stories of the ancient Greeks the light 
of day comes from a strong and beautiful youth named 
Helios, who, in a chariot of fire drawn by four flaming 
horses, rises out of the east every morning and drives over 
the arch of the heavens to the west, where he is lost in the 
twilight of evening. It was thus they thought that the 
gods harnessed the sun and made him give daylight to 
man. It remained for man himself to harness the light- 
ning, and force it to serve him at night or at any other 
hour he commanded. We all know that lightning comes 
from electricity, and that its flashes are of the same char- 
acter as the brilliant blaze of the great arc light or the 
golden glow of the incandescent lamp. It is in this re- 
spect only that we may speak of man harnessing the light- 
ning. It would be better to say that he has harnessed 
electricity; for the flashes which illuminate the sky are 
merely exhibitions of that mighty force. 
It is hard to explain just what electricity is. It is only 
recently that man has known much about it; and it was 
not until within a generation or so ago that any one realized 
that it could be made to give light for our houses and 
streets. Even now there is a difference of opinion as to

-P-A-G-E-301
LIGHTING BY ELECTRICITY 301 
just how it works, and we shall probably discover a great 
deal more concerning it as time goes on. It is safe to say 
that it is one of the great forces of nature; one of the 
forms of energy which is a general term used for the vari- 
ous forces that make the wheels of the world go round. 
It is energy that moves all kinds of matter. Energy causes 
the sun to shine, the plants to grow, the fires to burn, and 
the winds to sweep to and fro. Energy makes heat and 
light. By it water boils and, in steam, it runs our railroads 
and factories. 
From energy in the form of electricity we have much 
the same results. Electric energy moves machinery of a 
thousand kinds. It turns the wheels of the electric car 
and automobile. It carries the whisper of the telephone, 
and through its brilliant lamps we are able to turn night 
into day. It is a kind of energy which seems more easily 
carried than any other, and there are certain materials 
through which it can be sent at lightning speed. 
Among these are the copper wire and other mediums, 
called conductors, which we use for telegraphs, telephones, 
street cars, and the many things operated by the electric 
current. On the other hand, it is very difficult to force it 
through certain materials such as glass and rubber, which 
for this reason are called non-conductors. And so man, 
by using the right sort of matter in connection with it, can 
imprison this energy, and carry it where and how he will. 
Moreover, it has been found that electric energy works 
in such a way that it will produce an intense heat if it is 
conducted through just the right sort of material in cer- 
tain fixed ways. It will create fire; or if the material is 
right and inclosed in a glass globe in which there is no air, 
 
-P-A-G-E-302

it will come to a white heat and give out a brilliant light. 
| This is the electric light of the incandescent lamp made by 
the medium within the globe turned white hot by the elec- 
tricity going through it. 
The electricity is carried to the globe by copper wire,

the globe.are fastened to the copper by fine wires of plati- 
num, another metal that will carry electricity and at the 
same time withstand great heat. The platinum wires pass 
through the glass. The fiery thread or medium within the 
globe which looks gray or black when the electricity is not 
passing through it, is often made of vegetable fiber, and 
frequently of bamboo, which has been carbonized or turned 
 
-P-A-G-E-303

to charcoal by a special process. If it were out in the air, 
the electricity would burn it up at once, but confined in a 
vacuum or where there is little or no air it grows white hot, 
and is consumed so slowly that in a lamp of sixteen candle 
power, with the ordinary current, it should give out light 
for one thousand hours. 
In the arc lamps, or glass globes of the size of a foot- 
ball or larger, which are often used for public halls and 
street lighting, the electricity passes through two sticks of 
black carbon as big around as one’s finger. These are fit- 
ted into the top and bottom of the globe in such a way that 
their ends almost meet in the center, and are so controlled 
that they are kept just the right distance apart. The elec- 
tricity flows through the carbons, jumping across the space 
between them and, as it does so, tearing carbon dust from 
the ends of the sticks, which the intense heat consumes. 
In such lighting the points of the carbons must first be 
brought together for a moment, when the current heats 
them white hot. After that they are moved the right dis- 
tance apart and the electricity flows through the hot air 
across from one to the other. This light is not in a vac- 
uum, the globe acting merely as a protector for the carbons. 
But where does this force come from and how can it be 
harnessed so that it will do what we. want? It was a long 
time before man was aware that any such thing existed, 
and it has been only step by step that we have learned 
what we now know. Long, long before Christ, a Greek, 
one Thales of Miletus, wrote that amber when rubbed 
would attract or draw to itself other bits of matter or light 
bodies placed near it. Several centuries later it was shown 
that other things would do the same, and as time went on
-P-A-G-E-304
  
304 LIGHTING BY ELECTRICITY 
man began to suppose there was in nature 
some such thing as electricity. Many great 
scientists discussed it and among them was 
Sir Isaac Newton, the man who, when he 
saw an apple fall from the tree, reasoned out 
the law of gravitation. Benjamin Franklin ,; 
thought that lightning was produced by electricity, and he 
tested it by his silk kite through which he received a shock 
from the clouds. 
A little later men found that electricity could be easily 
carried by metals of various kinds, and an Italian named 
Galvani discovered the principle of the galvanic battery. 
Galvani had laid a machine containing electricity down be- 
beside some frog legs which his wife had just skinned and 
was about to cook for the family dinner, when he observed 
that the frog legs jerked this way and that. At first 
he thought there was apectiay, in the frogs; but he 
afterwards discovered that the 
muscles and nerves were sensi- 
tive to the electric current of 
the machine and were thus 
affected by it. To learn more 
he hooked a pair of frog legs to 
a kite string and flying his kite 
with these at the end near an 
iron railing discovered that they 
began to jerk whenever they 
touched the railing, electricity 
apparently running down the 
string from the air although no 
lightning was flashing.

As a result of these and many other experiments men 
finally discovered that a continuous supply of electricity 
could be generated. It was found that it might be pro-

of it by going to any

such as those that run

is enough here to say 
that by means of steam 
or gas engines, con- 
nected with such mag-

duce electricity, and 
that we can do this more 
easily and cheaply by 
such water power as is 
found in many parts of

LAMPS AND BURNERS. HOW MATCHES ARE MADE 307 
Many of the cities and towns of the United States are 
now lighted by the waterfalls near them. Among: the 
most remarkable of these is Spokane, Washington, where 
the Spokane River dashes down over.the rocks with great 
force as it flows on towards the Columbia. Connected 
with the Spokane Falls huge spouts or pipes have been set 
into the bed of the river, and the force of the water falling 
through these is carried to dynamos, which generate a 
current that lights thousands of homes. Seattle is lighted 
largely by the force of the Snoqualmie Falls, which are 
forty miles away; and Los Angeles gets its light from 
Owens Lake, which is situated up in the Sierra Nevada 
Mountains two hundred and fifty miles distant, and is carried 
by many miles of canals down into and through the valleys 
to where Los Angeles lies. 
The electricity used in San Francisco is also carried a 
long distance, and if we should travel over Europe, we 
should find many cities and towns which are getting their 
light and power from the waterfalls near them.

HE light from oil, gas, or electricity depends largely 
on the lamps through which the light comes. In 
electricity we have various inventions which greatly in- 
crease the illuminating power of the current. The Nernst 
lamp uses a small rod instead of a thread, and the light 
is not burned in a vacuum. The rod is a combination of 
magnesia and certain rare earths, and it gives out a brilliant
-P-A-G-E-308
  
308 LAMPS AND BURNERS. HOW MATCHES ARE MADE 
light. Another strong light is produced by using a metal 
called tungsten in place of the thread of carbon, and other 
electric lights are made by other materials. 
In gas lighting the flame is largely governed by the jet 
or burner through which the gas flows. This in the 
ordinary light is a short brass tube an inch or so long, and 
about as thick as alead pencil. Inside it is a little strainer 
made of wire netting to catch any impurities in the gas, 
and at the top is a tip of fire clay or perhaps of aluminium, 
pierced by a little hole through which the gas comes. 
The intensity of the flame is often increased by various 
burners, or by mantles which fit over the jet. The 
mantle, for instance, is a little white hood to be used 
inside a chimney. The hood is made of a net of cotton 
thread soaked with the oxides of certain metals. When 
the gas is lighted the cotton burns out, and leaves a skeleton 
network of these metals, which being heated white hot by 
the flame greatly increases the light. Such mantles are 
largely employed in street lighting, and also in public halls 
and houses where much light is desired. 
The story of the lamp goes back to the beginnings of 
things. Homer, the ancient Greek who wrote for us the 
fairy tales of Ulysses, refers to the festival of lamps 
which was held in his day, almost one thousand years 
before Christ. Bronze lamps have been found which 
were used by the lake dwellers of Switzerland, who lived 
so long ago that we know little about them; and in the 
public museums are hundreds of lamps of stone, clay, and 
bronze which have been dug from the ruins of the great 
cities of the past. We have terra cotta lamps which were 
used in Babylon ages ago, bronze lamps which came from 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
    
 
-P-A-G-E-310
  310 LAMPS AND BURNERS. HOW MATCHES ARE MADE 
Athens, and clay lamps from Carthage. I remember once 
while traveling through Egypt near the site of old Mem- 
phis, I bought a clay lamp which my guide said dated 
back to the times of the Pharaohs. It was dug from one 
of the tombs and the man who sold it offered me the little 
finger of a mummy which had been found near the lamp. 
The first lamp was probably a shell filled with fat, with 
a bit of dried mossas a wick. Later came lamps of clay, 
and later still lamps of bronze, iron, and other metals. 
The Greeks and Romans made beautiful lamps stamped 
on the bottom with the name of the maker; and iron and 
brass lamps of many kinds were in use during the Middle 
Ages. 
The light from all of these lamps was pale, smoky, and 
flickering, and it was not until modern times that man 
began to study how to increase the brilliancy of the flame. 
The first great improvement, which was made only a little 
more than a hundred years ago, was the flat, woven, ribbon- 
like wick, fitted into a frame so that only a small surface 
could be burned at a time. Then came the round wick or 
Argand burner, named after the Swiss who invented it, 
and later still the student lamp, made by a German. 
Argand used an iron chimney for his light, with an opening 
through which the flame could be seen; and it was one of 
his workmen who first suggested chimneys of glass. This 
man was trying to heat a bottle over the lamp when the 
heat cracked off the bottom. At the same time the glass 
grew very hot, and he dropped it over the flame. The 
result was that the flame shone out through the glass, and 
gave a steadier light than could be produced by the sheet 
iron chimney. It was in 1800 that Carcel made a lamp
-P-A-G-E-311
  LAMPS AND BURNERS. HOW MATCHES ARE MADE 311 
with a clockwork attachment by which the wick was raised 
bit by bit as the clock ticked; and later still small hand 
lamps were made of tin, brass, and pewter. 
The first lamps used in the United States were those 
brought over from Europe by our colonial forefathers. 
The Indians then lighted their wigwams with pine torches, 
  Colonial lamps. 
and the only tribes which had lamps were the Eskimos, 
who used shallow vessels of stone, bone, or clay in which 
they burnt the oil of the seal, walrus, or whale, with dry 
moss as a wick. Such lamps are to be found in Alaska 
to-day. 
The chief lamps of the Pilgrims were known as Betty 
lamps. They were made of forged or cast’ iron, and 
were often of a pear shape with a place for the wick in the

  top. Others were like candlesticks, with a vessel on the 
top and a saucer to catch the oil if it dripped down or ran 
over. The first of the Bettys were imported from England, 
but later on they were manufactured at Portsmouth, New 
Hampshire, and Newbury, Massachusetts, and, for this 
reason, were known as Portsmouth or Newbury Bettys. 
We have already seen how Benjamin Franklin gave us 
some of our first knowledge of electricity through flying 
his kite, and how he invented one of the stoves of our 
colonial days. We are also indebted to him for an early 
improvement on lamps. Franklin’s father was a candle 
maker in Boston and when Benjamin was a little boy he 
had to cut the wicks for the candles and fill. the molds 
with the melted grease. He did not like the work, and 
when he grew to a man, he planned a lamp which would 
  Colonial lamps.
-P-A-G-E-313
  LAMPS AND BURNERS. HOW MATCHES ARE MADE — 313 
give out more light than several of the candles he had 
made as a boy. This lamp had two round tubes through 
which two loosely braided cotton wicks ran, extending 
down into a tube of whale oil. Franklin did not patent 
this invention, but it came into general use, and proved to 
be better than any lamp employed up to that time. 
After this many other improvements of more or less 
value were made, but they were all for lamps which burnt 
lard or fish oil, and it was not until the great lighting value 
of coal oil was discovered that we had the lamps which 
give the brilliant light of to-day. For these we are in- 
debted largely to Samuel Kier, a druggist of Pittsburg, 
who was one of the first men to refine coal oil and employ 
it for lighting. In the latter process he surrounded the 
flame with a glass chimney, using an Argand burner, 
thereby producing a beautiful light. Kier did not invent 
the chimney, for as we have seen that had already been 
discovered by the man who was working for Argand, but 
he adapted it to the coal oil lamp, and it soon came into 
general use. 
Now let us shut our eyes, and for the moment suppose 
that we are little children living two hundred years ago. 
Let each imagine that his parents have told him to light 
the fire or the candle and wonder how he is to go about . 
doing it. He cannot use matches, for such things have 
not yet been invented. He takes up a splinter and starts 
towards the fireplace. But alas, the fire has gone out, and 
there are only ashes and dead charcoal on the black hearth. 
The only ways in which he can get light are by the methods 
of fire making then known. He debates for a moment 
whether he shall take a flint and strike it on steel, so that
-P-A-G-E-314

the sparks will fall on some dry tinder or kindling, which 
he can then blow into a flame; or whether he shall roll one 
stick of wood rapidly around ina hole made inside another, 
and by friction gradually bring smoke and a blaze. 
Either way is difficult, and as he has had no experience he 
will probably fail. 
Indeed, the light which we now get by simply striking a 
match was hard to create only a few generations ago. 
Then every family covered the coals in the fireplace with 
ashes before going to bed, and kept at least one fire burn- 
ing throughout the year. Our colonial forefathers had 
boxes of flint and steel in their houses; and as they found 
that scorched linen would quickly ignite, they saved their 
old handkerchiefs and worn-out sheets and charred them, 
in order that they might catch upon them the sparks from the 
flint. The guns had flintlocks, and thereby lit the powder, 
and the hunter often used his gun flint to start the camp fire. 
It was not until 1827 that the lucifer match, that could 
be lighted by friction, was invented, although it was known 
that the materials used in making it could be ignited long 
before that. The first matches were made by dipping 
little sticks of wood into a compound of brimstone, chlo- 
rate of potash, and some other materials. They were then 
dried, and were lit by drawing them through a piece of 
folded sandpaper. Later they were made so that they 
would strike upon being drawn over any rough and dry 
surface; and now, after many improvements of various 
kinds, matches are used throughout the world. 
We make so many matches in the United States that we 
could each use five every day and have some to spare. We 
produce so many in one year that if they were all laid end

  Match-making machines. 
The first matches were made in’England. The splints 
were cut by hand, and the manufacture was so costly that 
they sold at the rate of three or four for a cent. Then 
machines were gradually invented, and now they are very 
cheap. We have single machines which will make four 
million matches a day. 
The wood most commonly used for matches is pine, 
thoroughly dried and sawed into match lengths. The 
blocks are then put into an automotic feeder, which carries 
them to the machine where they are cut into shape. The 
machine cuts forty-eight matches at one stroke, and it
-P-A-G-E-316
  316 LAMPS AND BURNERS. HOW MATCHES ARE MADE 
makes several hundred strokes every minute. At the same 
time it sticks the matches in a flexible cast-iron band, where 
they stand out like the bristles in a brush, and upon which 
they travel around wheel after wheel, dipping the ends into 
the vats which give them their caps of sulphur, paraffin, 
phosphorus, and other lighting materials. The matches, 
still in the band; are then carried through blasts of cool air, 
until they are dry and ready to pack. These machines are 
reliable. They will not handle broken matches, and the 
dust and splinters drop out and are carried down into the 
furnaces which furnish the steam for the works. Each 
machine will turn out several million matches per day, and 
it requires only twelve hands to operate it. 
The matches are packed, by girls, into boxes which con- 
tain from sixty-five to five hundred each. The girls have 
seats at circular tables, which revolve as the matches fall 
on them. The boxes are also made by machinery, the 
sheets of pine or straw board of which they are composed 
going in at one end and coming out at the other in boxes. 
This machinery saves a great deal of labor. 
The match business is done in numerous factories, a 
single one of which turns out as many as one hundred 
million matches per day. They make matches of wax 
and paper as well as of wood. They manufacture also 
the safety match that lights only upon striking the sides 
of the boxes, which are coated with a special preparation 
of phosphorus and powdered glass or emery that causes 
it to burst into flame. There is no phosphorus in the head 
of the safety match; but this is put on the box, and when 
the match is rubbed over it the explosion occurs which 
produces the light.

37. THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET AND ITS 
SUCCESSORS 
“How dear to this heart are the scenes of my childhood, 
When fond recollection presents them to view! 
The orchard, the meadow, the deep-tangled wildwood, 
And every loved spot which my infancy knew! 
The wide-spreading pond, and the mill that stood by it, 
The bridge, and the rock where the cataract fell, 
The cot of my father, the dairy-house nigh it, 
And e’en the rude bucket that hung in the well — 
The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket, 
The moss-covered bucket which hung in the well. 
“That moss-covered vessel I hailed as a treasure, 
For often at noon, when returned from the field, 
I found it the source of an exquisite pleasure, 
The purest and sweetest that nature can yield. 
How ardent I seized it, with hands that were glowing, 
And quick to the white-pebbled bottom it fell ; 
Then soon, with the emblem of truth overflowing, 
And dripping with coolness, it rose from the well — 
The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket, 
The moss-covered bucket arose from the well.” 
HE old oaken bucket is rapidly becoming a thing of 
the past. The modern pump has taken its place, and 
in our cities and towns the public works which give every 
home its water supply have consigned it to the things 
forgotten. Even far out in the country, upon many of 
our farms, we have harnessed old Eolus, whom the Greeks 
regarded as the God of the Winds, and have made him 
turn the wheels of the windmills which operate our pumps, 
and, in many instances, are making the gasoline or steam 
engine do the same.

among the wonders of this world of industry through

they are before us

we investigate how 
our little world broth- 
ers and sisters of the 
nations far away pro- 
cure water, we should 
see that we are far 
better off, and be 
thankful.

smaller cities of 
Korea. The water

else. The boy draws up the water and carries it in two 
great pails fastened to a framework which rests on his 
back. Each family pays so much a day or month for its 
water, and you may be sure that the children are warned 
against wasting it. It is so costly that the family washings 
are taken to the streams; and as for bathrooms, they are 
almost unknown. 
It is much the same in China and India. In the latter

country water-carrying is a regular trade followed by cer- 
tain families or castes from generation to generation. In 
the cities of Egypt 
drinking water is 
sold on the streets, 
and in Manchuria 
the water man has   
a great samovar or 
tea pot, from which 
he sells it steaming 
hot to his customers. 
In Morocco and Al- 
geria the water is 
drawn from the 
wells in goatskins 
and carried in such 
skins through the 
streets on the backs 
of men. In Tripoli 
I have seen it ped- 
dled about from 
large barrels slung 
across the humps of 
grumbling camels, 
which knelt beside 
the wells and wept 
real tears while they 
were loaded. 
In many parts of the world the fetching the water is the 
work of the women, just as cooking, sewing, and dish 
washing are with us. This is especially true of Palestine,       A country home water plant.

  where girls may be seen at the public wells awaiting their 
turn, as was Rebecca when young Jacob met her and 
fell in love with her. The little girl of the Holy Land 
begins to carry water almost as soon as she can walk. At 
first she has only a small jar which she bears on her head. 
As she grows older this becomes larger, so that when full 
grown she is able to carry three or four gallons. Such a jar 
when filled weighs 
thirty or forty 
pounds, but the 
woman balances it 
on her head and 
walks along without 
touching it. 
In countries like 
those referred to the 
water supply is often 
from springs or 
streams, or cisterns 
and pools. Most of 
the water of Jerusa- 
lem is from cisterns, 
each of the larger 
houses having one 
in the court in its 
center. Outside that city is the Pool of Siloam, and from 
other pools comes the water used by many homes. In 
some parts of Australia the people rely upon the rains, 
which fall copiously during a part of the year. The rain 
from the roof is carried by spouts into great tanks of gal- 
vanized iron, which rest upon the porches. The water is

cooled for drinking by putting it into canvas bags and 
hanging them where the wind blows. Some of the water 
soaks through the bag, and the evaporation of this makes 
that inside as cool as though fresh from a spring. 
In regions where there is no rain for a part of the year, 
cisterns are very important. They are usually made of 
stone or brick so cemented 
together that they will hold 
water; and they are placed 
where they will catch the 
rainfall. Many of the 
ancient cities had such stor- 
age tanks; and, as we shall 
see later, our own cities have 
reservoirs in which the water 
from streams or wells is 
stored and held to be let out 
as needed. 
Some of the most remark- 
able of the ancient cisterns 
were those of Carthage, con- 
structed about 500 B.c. They were fed by the rains, and 
by springs far away in the mountains, the water being 
carried in great stone troughs built high up above the 
ground on pillars of masonry. These cisterns could supply 
six million gallons of water a day. They were enormous 
barrel-shaped caverns eighty feet thick and more than 
four hundred feet long, with pipes running from them 
to the various parts of the city. When I visited the 
site of old Carthage a year or so ago, I found most of 
these old reservoirs in ruins with Arabs living in them.

  Cisterns of Carthage. 
Others of the cisterns have been repaired, and some are 
now used to supply water to the towns and villages near 
by. These are thirty feet deep, and five hundred feet 
long. They are connected with steam engines which do 
the pumping. The old aqueduct has been repaired and 
with some modern additions it now gives water to the city 
of Tunis, which is not far from where Carthage once stood. 
In olden times and indeed until recently a great part of 
the water used by man came from dug wells. This was so 
in America during our colonial days, and it is still true of 
many of the less civilized countries of the world. In India 
wells twenty or thirty feet in diameter have been dug far 
down into the earth. They are often used for irrigation, 
the water being drawn by bullocks in great bags of cow-

skins and poured into canals through which it goes over 
the fields. Egypt has many wells worked by the sakiyeh, 
a wheel turned around by a blindfolded bullock, camel, 
or water buffalo. The wheel has cogs which fit into the 
cogs of a vertical wheel to the rim of which clay jars are 
fastened. The vertical wheel extends down into the well, 
and as it turns the jars dip into the water and fill, emptying 
into a trough as it turns. There are wells in all the oases 
of the Sahara, and in the fertile spots of most desert regions. 
There are many in China and Japan, and in Europe, and 
in most other countries of the world.

“The sakiyeh, a wheel turned around by a blindfolded bullock.” 
  Our wells of to-day are different from those of the past. 
Instead of digging a great hole in the earth and rock and 
walling it with brick or stone, we now use machinery to

drill or bore a hole from three to eight inches in diameter 
far down into the earth, and tap the porous on into 
which the water from above has drained. This rock is often 
surrounded by other rock of such a nature that the water 
cannot pass through it, the porous rock thus forming a 
spongelike reservoir which holds the water. Such rock

may lie not far from the surface, or it may be hundreds of 
feet below it with hard rocks above. Some of the bored 
wells are half a mile deep, and several have been sunk 
more than a mile straight down through the rock. There 
is one at Pittsburg which is more than forty-six hundred 
feet deep, and another at St. Louis which measures over 
thirty-eight hundred feet. One of the deepest of such

  THE WATER SUPPLY OF GREAT CITIES 325 
wells, near Leipzig in Germany, goes five thousand seven 
hundred and thirty-five feet down into the earth. 
In drilling such wells when the porous rock is first 
struck the water often rushes up with great force. One 
was put down near Paris which yielded more than five 
million gallons a day, throwing a column of water to the 
height of a five-story house, and there are several in 
Australia which flow one million or more gallons every 
twenty-four hours. In the Australian wells the water 
often rushes forth in such quantity that it eats out a 
channel many miles long through which it runs. One 
well there has produced six million gallons a day, and 
some others over one hundred thousand gallons an hour, 
furnishing water for vast flocks of sheep and serving also 
to irrigate thousands of acres of land. Most of the wells, 
however, yield only a few gallons per minute, and pumps 
worked by wind, steam, gasoline, or electricity are required 
to raise the water to the surface. Such wells are known 
as artesian wells, the name coming from the province of 
Artois in France, where the first deep wells of Europe 
were made. They are now to be found all over our coun- 
try, the water from them being pumped into high tanks 
built upon a framework of steel near the houses or barns.

sive than any attempted in the past. More water is 
now used than ever before. We require it, not only for 
scrubbing, cooking, washing, and bathing, but for water-

ing our lawns and streets, and for manufacturing purposes. 
New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia each use several 
hundred million gallons a day, and many of our cities 
daily consume more than two barrels of water for every 
man, woman, and child in them. In figuring out how 
much water a city should have, some engineers estimate 
the amount at fifty gallons or upwards per person each 
day, and this is so much that only our modern waterworks 
can supply it. 
  Roman aqueduct. 
It is an important question with every city, town, and 
village as to where it shall get its water supply and how it 
shall be carried into the houses. In some great cities the 
water is from rivers and lakes, in others from springs and

made for the purpose, far away in the mountains. Much

  Aqueduct across Harlem River, New York. 
much of that of London from the Thames. St. Petersburg 
is supplied by the Neva, Berlin by the Spree, Hamburg by 
the Elbe, and Rotterdam by the Rhine. In our own coun- 
try, Washington, Cincinnati, Louisville, St. Louis, Pittsburg, 
and Philadelphia are among the largest cities supplied by 
the rivers on whose banks they stand. Every one of us 
can probably tell what the names of these rivers are and 
mention other towns which get their water in the same 
way. The cities of the Great Lakes are supplied from 
those great natural reservoirs and the water of many of the 
big cities of Europe has a similar source. 
At the same time some other cities draw their water 
from under the ground, This is the case with Indian-

some of them are ten inches in diameter. They produce 
many millions of gallons of water each day. London gets 
some of its water also from a chalk bed below it, but even 
‘this and the rivers do not furnish all that it needs and it 
is now planned to bring water in pipes from the mountains 
of Wales, which are one hundred and eighty miles away. 
But how do the city works force the water into the 
houses? We can each find out as to his own town by 
visiting its waterworks, and this I advise you to do. The 
methods are different in different cities. The water is 
sometimes distributed by gravity from reservoirs or lakes,
-P-A-G-E-329
  THE WATER SUPPLY OF GREAT CITIES 329 
or from streams higher up than the highest roofs of the 
houses. This gives a great force and when the pipes are 
opened the water may be thrown high enough to be used 
when the buildings catch fire. In some places the water 
is pumped by machinery from other sources into reservoirs 
at the right elevation. Or it may be forced into stand- 
pipes, or pumped directly into the water mains with such a 
force that it will go through the houses and have also a 
pressure sufficient to protect them from fire. 
In every case the water flows from the works through 
the chief streets of the city in great mains, and is carried 
from them to the side streets in smaller pipes, and by pipes 
still smaller into the houses. These pipes are usually of

miles in length. The cost of making the reservoir and of 
putting in these pipes, added to the expense of the ma-

chinery connected with the waterworks, is great. It is 
easily paid by the consumers, however, each house being 
taxed a few dollars a year according to the water used in it. 
There is one thing we almost always consider as to our 
water supply. This is that the water be pure or at least 
free from such germs and bacteria as might make us ill. 
  Irrigation canal, Washington. 
The large wells in which hung the old oaken buckets were 
often near stables and other buildings from which foul mat- 
ter sank down into the soil and drains, thus causing fevers 
and other diseases. In the artesian or bored wells, the 
hole is small and it often goes down hundreds of feet through 
the rock. Nevertheless it should be kept far away from 
any place from which foul stuff might seep in, and the 
water should be carefully examined from time to time that 
we may know it is good. |
-P-A-G-E-331
  FURNITURE 331 
There are several tests which may be made, and it is al- 
ways best to be careful. If there is any doubt whatever, 
the water should be rejected, or sent to a chemist who can 
tell you what it contains. 
Indeed, the purity of water is now thought to be so im- 
portant, that most of our cities have built great settling 
reservoirs and filters through which the water is passed be- 
fore it is let out into the mains of the city. In some places 
it is run over beds of gravel and sand, which are changed 
from time to time as they become filled with impurities. 
There are at Philadelphia works of this kind which filter 
millions of gallons a day, and Washington and other places 
have fine filtration plants. In Washington the water is 
brought from the Great Falls of the Potomac through an 
aqueduct to a reservoir, from which it passes on through 
another aqueduct into the filtration beds. Here it 4s con- 
ducted into twenty-nine great chambers built under the 
ground. These chambers are made of concrete and their 
floors are covered to a depth of four feet with beds of fine 
. sand and gravel. The water flows over these beds and 
drains through them, passing out clean and clear into a 
reservoir or lake from which it goes into the pipes of the 
city. Each of the chambers will filter three million gallons 
a day, and from sixty to seventy-five million gallons of pure 
water are thus daily furnished to the people of our 
national capital. —cotazoo— 
39. FURNITURE 
HE object of our journey to-day is to learn about the 
furniture which forms to a great extent the life of the 
home and a large part of its comfort. We first visit Japan.

The houses here are comparatively bare. There are no 
beds but thick wadded quilts laid on the soft white mats of 
the floor, and the only tables are little low portable ones 
which are used chiefly as trays for bringing the food in 
at the meals. There are neither sofas nor chairs. The 
people sit on their heels, and when one writes a letter he 
rests his paper on his knees or perhaps lies on his stomach 
and writes on the floor. 
Crossing tothe mainland of Asia we observe that the 
Chinese of the better classes have bedsteads which are often 
beautifully carved, but they are without springs and usu- 
ally without mattresses. They have chairs, but the backs 
are straight; and the cushions are so thin that we might 
as well sit on hard wood. Many of the poorer Chinese 
sleep upon ledges built in one side of the room and heated, 
as we have already seen, by flues running under them. 
The Koreans sleep on the floor and their tables are like 
those of Japan. As to tableware, all these people have 
beautiful porcelains, and all use chopsticks instead of the 
fork. 
In the Philippine Islands the poorer people sleep upon 
a framework of bamboo canes upon which matting is laid; 
and in India the most common bed is a rude wooden frame 
witha network of ropes as thick as a clothesline stretched 
over it. The bed is so small that a grown man must bend 
up his legs and. lie “spoon fashion” upon it. The East 
Indian peasant’s home is usually a hut, and his furniture 
consists of little more than a table, a few stools, and a 
bed. Hehasa set of brass bowls to drink from, and these 
are scoured so that they shine like gold. ‘The Burman 
sleeps upon mats, and his pillow is a little frame of bamboo,

which rests under his neck. His dishes are bowls of lac- 
quer, and his cups ladles of coconut shell. 
The native African sleeps on a bed of grass or leaves, 
or perhaps a coarse mat which is rolled up during the 
day ; and the same is true of the many tribes of the islands 
of the Pacific Ocean. In Mohammedan lands the houses 
have divans covered with soft cushions on which the people

sit and sleep, and the tables are often brass trays on a 
framework of wood. They use dishes and bowls at their 
meals, but the table is set without knives or forks. Every 
one has his own knife and spoon, and he eats with his 
fingers. In Europe and South America the people use 
beds, tables, and chairs much like our own, and they have 
about the same tableware. 
As we journey on from country to country we observe 
that the furniture used by a people is to some extent a 
sign of its civilization. The first men slept upon grass like

were logs and flat stones. After that they built ledges 
which they covered with skins; and then made stools and: 
rude tables of one kind or another. The ancient Egyptians 
and Greeks had tables and chairs; and the Romans had

couches about their dining tables upon which they lay at 
their meals. | 
During the Middle Ages the beds of the rich were lux- 
urious. Sheets of fine linen were used, and the mattresses 
were covered with silk. The beds were enormous. Queen 
Elizabeth had one which was seven feet wide, and certain 
kings then held their receptions in bed. The beds were 
covered with hangings, and the posts at the corners ran
-P-A-G-E-335
  
  FURNITURE 338 
almost to the ceilings. This was the nature of the better 
beds of our country in colonial times. George Washington 
and others of our early presidents slept inside the “ four 
poster’; and it was such a bed that Andrew Jackson had. 
We now regard inclosed beds unhealthful, and think that 
one should have the windows wide open and sleep under 
sheets and light blankets with nothing about him to keep 
out the air. 
In our colonial days the dining tables were often long, 
wide boards laid upon trestles shaped like a sawhorse, 
which were taken apart and placed against the walls after 
meals. The tablecloth was called a board cloth. It was 
often of homespun linen made in the family. Our first 
settlers had but little tableware, and it was some years 
before the two-tined steel fork came into general use. 
They had knives, spoons, and cups, but trenchers or 
wooden platters took the place ‘of our plates, and glass- 
ware was so rare that 
it was highly prized. 
Miles Standish ate from 
a trencher; and John 
        Winthrop, the Governor of the Massachusetts Colony, 
brought the first fork to America in 1633. Silver knives 
and forks came into use soon after the Civil War.  
-P-A-G-E-336
   336 FURNITURE | 
At that time but few families had china and there were 
no saucers or covered dishes. There were seldom enough 
cups to go round, and only enough chairs or stools for the 
grown-ups. Some families had a narrow bench on each 
side of the table, and the children often stood behind those 
who sat there and the food was handed to them. In other 
places the children stood at a side 
table and brought their wooden 
plates to the main table for more 
food, when their first portion was 
eaten. 
To-day the poorest of us have 
enough knives, forks, and dishes for 
all the children, and every little one 
has his seat at the table. ‘We have 
comfortable beds, and easy chairs of 
all kinds. Our floors are covered 
with carpets and rugs, and many of 
us live in more luxury than the kings of the past. 
  Indeed, we now require so much for our homes that a 
great industry has grown up to supply the demand. Thou- 
sands of workmen are kept busy making furniture and their 
output is enormous. We have seven cities each of which 
produces from three million to thirteen million dollars’ 
worth of furniture per annum. The chief of these are 
New York and Chicago, the two largest cities of our country, 
but next comes Grand Rapids, Michigan, which makes a 
specialty of such manufacture. 
Grand Rapids has over five hundred furniture factories, 
and it has many thousand men who do nothing else but 
make bureaus, beds, tables, and chairs, and other things for

the home. The industry began when the city was still 
surrounded by forests of hard woods, and now although 
these have been cut away it still thrives on account of the 
skill of its workmen, and the fame which its furniture has 
for beauty, cheapness, and excellence of construction. 
Twice a year the city has furniture fairs to which mer- 
chants from all parts of the United States and even from

other countries come to see the new patterns and to buy 
for their stores. In/some years many thousand people visit 
these fairs, and the sales amount to as much as two 
hundred million dollars. The town has great exposition 
buildings for showing its wares.

the wood comes from far-away parts of the world. There 
is mahogany from Cuba, Central America, and Africa;

teakwood from the jungles of Siam and Burma ; rosewood 
from the valley of the Amazon; bamboos from Japan; and 
rattan from Borneo and other islands of the Dutch East 
Indies. There are bird’s-eye maple, oak, walnut, and 
cherry from different parts of the United States, and 
cheaper woods from our great forest belts. Some of the 
woods are costly, and especially the mahogany, a single log 
of which may be worth several thousand dollars. 
Indeed, many woods are so valuable that they are used 
in thin sheets, which are pasted or glued to other wood so 
firmly that the twoseem asone. The fine woods cover the 
cheap woods like a skin, and are so fitted on that no one 
would suppose that the furniture was not wholly made of 
the costly hard wood. Such work is called veneering. 
The fine wood is sliced or sawed by delicate machinery 
into great sheets, not so thick as the cover of this book. 
These are then treated so that they can be wrapped around 
a column, or made to follow the curves of an armchair or 
bedstead. The veneer is put on rough, and then smoothed 
and polished so that it shines like a mirror. 
Most of our fine furniture is veneered in this way, the 
oak, mahogany, maple, and birch being glued upon pine, 
poplar, or other cheap wood. The core, as the cheap 
wood is called, is usually covered with two thicknesses of 
veneering, the grain of the wood of one running in one 
direction and that of the other crossing it at right angles. 
This prevents cracking, and, if properly done, makes the 
furniture more durable than though it were solid and of 
one wood throughout. 
The work of polishing and carving is now largely per- 
formed by machinery. The wood is smoothed by great

drums covered with sandpaper, one of which will do as 
much as twenty men working by hand; and the carvers are 
aided by cutting tools, moved by machinery which turns 
them around at the rate of fifteen hundred revolutions 
a minute.

T is a long way fromthe dirt floor covered with leaves, 
grass, rushes, or the skins of wild beasts to the beautiful 
carpets and rugs to-day. Just when man began to make 
rugs is not known; but there are pictures of weavers at 
work on the stone walls of the tomb of Beni Hassan in 
Egypt, and we know that those pictures were cut more 
than forty-five hundred years ago. The ancient Egyptians 
spread rugs before the images of their gods, and it is said 
they sometimes laid them down on the ground for their 
sacred cattle to lie on. 
Alexander the Great had splendid carpets, and he found 
such carpets in use during his march through Asia to 
India. For a long time the finest rugs of the world were 
woven in Persia, Turkey, and Syria; and to-day the most 
costly ones are some which were made in those lands long, 
long ago. We have old Persian rugs which sell for a 
thousand dollars and upwards apiece; and some fine silk 
ones, beautifully woven, have brought as much as twenty-five 
thousand dollars. Those old rugs were all woven by hand, 
and the best of them took many months in their making. 2 
They are composed of fine wool or silk, and have colors 
and tints which we cannot make now. 
It was during the Crusades that the art of rug making
-P-A-G-E-340
340. FLOOR COVERINGS 
was carried from Turkey to Europe; and at that time 
the noble ladies of England, France, and other coun- 
tries made carpets and tapestry wall-hangings with their 
needles and upon 
their rude looms. 
Later factories were 
started,and Belgium 
began to make Brus- 
sels carpet, the name 
coming from the city 
of Brussels. Some 
of the Belgian weav- 
ers went to England 
and settled at Bristol, 
where they made 
Bristol carpet, and 
in 1745 some French 
weavers established 
a factory at Wilton, 
England, and began to make a carpet like that we now 
know as Wilton. 
  Persians weaving rugs. 
All these first carpets were costly. They were woven 
largely by hand, and only the rich could afford them. In 
colony times most of our houses had bare floors, or carpets 
woven of old rags torn into strips. The strips were sewed 
end to to end, and then woven on rude looms by the women 
of the family. A few of our wealthy people had Turkish 
rugs and ingrain carpets which had been imported, but 
these were so rare that the children were often warned 
to walk lightly when upon special occasions they were 
admitted to the carpeted room.

After the Jacquard loom was invented in 1801, carpets 
grew cheaper. Many other improvements in weaving 
machinery followed, and- we now make all kinds of car- 
pets and rugs at a very low cost. We have enormous 
factories which weave nothing else. There is one at 
  Making carpets. 
Yonkers, New York, that has one thousand looms run 
by machinery, and turns out as much as fifteen million 
yards of carpet a year. This would be enough to cover 
a walk six or seven feet wide, from where the factory 
stands clear across the United States to San Francisco. 
The factory employs five thousand hands, and two thirds 
of these are women and girls,
-P-A-G-E-343
FLOOR COVERINGS 343 
But this is only one factory, and we have so many 
others that we make altogether more than one hundred 
million yards of carpet a year. We weave all sorts of 
rugs, and carpets are now so cheap that even the poor- 
est can use more or less of them. We import also 
  In a Japanese home, 
“many rugs of cotton and jute from Japan, where such 
things are made at low cost. We also buy fine old rugs 
from the Orient, some of which, although used for years, 
are more beautiful than any now made. 
In addition to these floor coverings of wool, silk, and 
cotton, we have mattings made of a straw which grows 
in China and Japan. The straw is a sort of grass or reed 
which reaches a height of six feet. When it is ripe 
jt is cut, dried, and packed up in bales, and shipped to
-P-A-G-E-344
  344 FLOOR COVERINGS 
the factories. It is there sorted and the freshest and 
greenest of the straws are taken for the white parts of 
the matting, while the rest is put aside to be dyed. The 
matting is woven like cloth, and much of it upon hand 
looms, operated ‘by children. During a visit to a Japa- 
nese factory I saw some little ones of eight and ten years 
of age working at the machines, and I was told that they

were paid only a few cents a day. Such matting is put 
up in rolls of forty yards each, and tightly packed for 
shipment across the Pacific Ocean to the United States. 
Other mattings are made of the husk of the coconut. 
The nuts as we buy them in the store have been shelled, 
much as we shell black walnuts. Around each nut as it 
 
-P-A-G-E-345
  FLOOR COVERINGS 345 
falls from the tree is a husk as thick as your finger, and 
composed of a coarse fiber, known to commerce as coir. 
It is from this that coir matting is made. The husks are 
soaked in water until they are soft, and the fiber is beaten 
out with hard wooden clubs. It can now be twisted into a 
yarn by rolling it between the palms of the hands, and this 
yarn can be reeled upon bobbins and woven by looms into 
mats. Such matting is coarse and durable. It is com- 
monly used for offices and for halls and stairs which have 
very hard wear. 
In addition to carpets and mattings we have certain floor 
coverings which are more or less waterproof. They are 
used for bathrooms, kitchens, and other such places. Among 
them are oilcloth and linoleum, made by passing a sheet 
of cheap fiber through liquid glue, rye flour, tapioca, or 
varnish, and then covering it with a mixture of ocher, lin- 
seed oil, and benzine. After this the oilcloth is printed 
by means of blocks, each of which gives one of the 
colors of the pattern. The cloth is then dried and 
varnished, after which it is trimmed and rolled up for 
the market. 
Linoleum is usually made of cork and linseed oil, to 
which are added a little resin and pigments of various 
kinds. The cork is the waste from the factories which make 
corks for bottles, the waste being ground into flour. In 
the meantime the light cotton cloth, which forms the base 
of the linoleum, has been covered with layers of boiled lin- 
seed oil. Itis upon these that the ground cork mixed 
with resin and oil is spread, the whole being rolled upon 
a backing of jute. The printing is done in the same way 
as upon oilcloth.

As we stop and think of the many places from which 
even the most common things in our homes come, we are 
amazed at their number and at their wide distances apart 
upon the face of the globe. They involve the work of 
nearly every nation and tribe upon this big round earth, 
giving employment to millions of our world brothers and 
sisters, and binding us to them through commerce and in- 
dustry as they relate to our shelter. Take, for instance, the 
materials which lie right under our feet, that we have been 
considering to-day. How many long journeys it would 
require to visit the places from whence they came, and to 
get well acquainted with the many queer people who have 
had a part in their making. The study of carpets would 
involve travels to all the wool-raising regions and also to 
the homes and factories in which the carpets are made. 
In the United States we annually make enough carpet to 
form a strip reaching twice around the globe, requiring 
hundreds of factories and thousands of looms. 
A study of matting would necessitate travels clear 
around the world; and an investigation of oilcloths would 
take us to the cork forests of Spain, the flax lands of India, 
and to the places whence come the resin, tapioca, benzine, 
and the other things used in their making. It would be 
the same with almost every article as relates to our shelter, 
and it would be an impossibility for us to cover them all. 
We must therefore be satisfied with having considered 
the main branches in this great field of industry and com- 
merce, and our travels shall now come to an end. This 
does not mean that we have seen all concerning them 
that the world has toshow. We might further investigate 
the wonders of our furniture, visiting the works from which 
 
-P-A-G-E-347
FLOOR COVERINGS 347 
  come the china we have on our tables, the pianos and 
organs which give us music, the pictures and other art 
works on our walls, and the books which form such a 
necessary part of our lives. We might go abroad to ex- 
amine the various kinds of architecture as shown in the 
mighty cathedrals and other structures of Europe, and 
look further into the home life of our little brothers and 
sisters of far-away lands. 
All these things would be interesting; but they are by 
no means essential to this series of travels as to “ How the 
World is Housed” and they may be left to our leisure at 
some time in the future.

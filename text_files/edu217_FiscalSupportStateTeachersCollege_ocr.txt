FISCAL SUPPORT OF STATE TEACHERS

CHAPTER I 
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF TEACHERS COL- 
LEGES AND THEIR ATTENDANT FISCAL 
PROBLEMS 
The state teachers college is the result of a process of evolution, 
not a direct creation. The early history of education in the United 
States does not record a single case where a state in planning for 
the professional training of its teachers projected a college. The 
term, normal school, is used uniformly except in the state of Illinois, 
where the first legislation on this subject established a Normal Uni- 
versity in 1857. While it may be difficult to see in the full-fledged 
teachers college of the present day any resemblance to the teacher 
training institution of 1839, it need only be pointed out that the 
dissimilarity in appearance is no greater than in the case of the 
original sickle and the modern harvester. In both cases the funda- 
mental purpose throughout the development has remained constant, 
but advancing civilization has enlarged the scope and made necessary 
a more extensive mechanism. It was not to be expected that the 
first established normal school would become the first teachers col- 
lege, any more than the first airship experiment would develop into 
the present successful high-powered airplane. However, it was one 
of the earlier normal schools that first took the advanced step. The 
first normal school founded in New York in 1844 was reorganized 
as a teachers college in 1890. Seven years later the Michigan State 
Normal School was given degree-granting privileges and became, in 
1897, the Michigan State Normal College. The growing need for 
more and better prepared teachers aided materially the development 
of these advanced teacher training institutions and courses leading 
to a degree were offered in the Illinois State Normal University in 
1907, Iowa State Teachers College in 1903, Colorado State Teach- 
ers College in 1911, and Indiana State Normal School in 1908.

  2 Fiscal Support of State Teachers Colleges 
In 1912 the Department of Normal Schools of the National Edu- 
cation Association * announced the following declaration of principles : 
1. The twentieth century normal school is dedicated to higher education, 
with the special function of supplying teachers for the rural schools, the 
elementary schools, and the high schools. 
2. Its entrance requirements as to scholarship will be practically the same 
requirements that are now demanded by the college—graduation from a four- 
year high school. 
3. It will extend its courses of instruction and practice, as conditions may 
demand, to four-year courses; thus giving it as high a standing in the way of 
discipline and scholarship as the college now possesses. 
4. It will widely extend the field of professional experimentation and in- 
vestigation. 
5. It will try out its graduates as to their ability to teach and manage 
schools by such a period of practice-teaching as will settle the case beyond 
peradventure. 
6. It will plan effectually to train teachers for rural schools, to stimulate 
and foster every educative agency toward the development of rural community 
life, and to elevate the professional position of the rural teacher. 
7. It will set up definite ends of education that will relate themselves to 
the life of the people in all departments of human interest and will thus be- 
come a great social energy.

a During the next five years the development was remarkable. In 
1923-1924, the number of institutions recognized by the American 
Association of Teachers Colleges was one hundred thirty-nine. 
It is but natural that an institution that has developed as rapidly 
as the teachers college has developed should face in its formative 
years some fundamental difficulties. Institutions for the profes- 
sional education of teachers have always been handicapped by lack 
of funds. The fact that, in spite of this serious obstacle, the teach- 
ers college has advanced so rapidly, must offer at least some evidence 
that it meets a basic need in a democracy,—providing a trained staff 
of teachers for the public schools. Now that collegiate rank has 
been reached, it is imperative that there shall be available for these 
institutions a measure of financial support that will enable them to 
do their work properly and, at the same time, remove the charges 
that have been held against them by universities, i.e., (1) inadequate 
library and laboratory facilities, (2) inadequately trained and poorly 
paid faculty, and (3) too many large classes, as well as too heavy a 
“ teaching load.” 
This brings before us the problem of fiscal support. In attacking 
that problem it should be known that state normal schools are uni- 
formly created by legislative enactment.? (The only exception is 
the state of North Dakota where four of the normal schools were 
specifically established and located by constitutional provision.) 
Resting on a statutory basis they are largely dependent upon recurrent 
appropriations for their maintenance. 
In Humphreys’? study of 173 state normal schools, it was found 
that 105 were built on donated sites, 66 received buildings or money 
from the local communities in addition, and 15 received money with 
no reference to sites.

  4 Fiscal Support of State Teachers Colleges 
From the beginning it will be noted that the states through their 
legislatures have attempted to place a part of the initial expense of 
establishing teacher training institutions upon the locality where 
they were to be erected. Humphreys’ study also revealed the fact 
that such schools were often located by means of political manipula- 
tion, “ trading,” and so on. These two tendencies have not contrib- 
uted to diminish the difficulties confronting the normal schools in 
the realization of their aims. 
It will be of value at this point to make a comparison of the amount 
of federal and state aid to universities, land-grant colleges and 
normal schools. Table I presents these facts.

Historical Development 7 
In addition to the facts reported in the preceding tables, fourteen 
states were granted salt lands. Out of the entire grant only three 
states devoted any. part to normal schools. Michigan gave 16,000 
acres for such purposes ; Kansas gave 30,380; and Nebraska gave the 
same amount." 
A review of Federal aid to state higher educational institutions 
indicates a very limited grant for teacher training institutions as 
contrasted with universities, land-grant colleges, mining and other 
technical colleges. The contrast is still more striking when we con- 
sider that the Federal government is now making an annual subven- 
tion to the extent of $80,000 to each state for its college of agri- 
culture and mechanical arts and its experiment stations. For the 
forty-eight states this yields a total of $3,840,000. Furthermore, 
the national government provides annually $5,580,000 for codp- 
erative agricultural extension work.® 
Is there any reason why the Federal government should not adopt 
toward state teachers colleges at least as favorable an attitude as it 
has pursued toward other higher educational institutions? Accord- 
ing to a recent report of the General Land Office, there were on 
July 1, 1921, in the United States, exclusive of Alaska, 190,000,000 
acres of land still the property of the Federal government. If the 
proceeds from these lands, when sold, were invested in 414 per cent 
securities and that annual income were supplemented by appropria- 
tion (following the precedent already established in the second Mor- 
rill Act and the Smith-Hughes Act) which would give to the teach- 
ers colleges an annual subsidy of $15,000,000, it would remove the 
discrimination which up to the present time the Federal government 
has maintained against them. 
Fees for Prospective Teachers. In view of the very limited Fed- 
eral aid to normal schools, the attitude of state legislative bodies 
toward the tuition of prospective teachers is noteworthy. Almost 
uniformly, the provision was made that students preparing to teach 
should be admitted to such schools without tuition. That the state 
recognized its responsibility to furnish an adequate supply of well- 
trained teachers with the minimum expense to such individuals is. 
indeed, commendable. That it placed its responsibility in this re-

8 Fiscal Support of State Teachers Colleges 
gard ahead of all others is evident from the not uncommon provisions 
in statutory form that students not preparing to teach might be 
admitted to such institutions at such tuition charges as the governing 
boards might consider reasonable. 
The following legislative enactments are quoted as typical of legis- 
lative provisions covering the establishment of state normal schools 
and the fees to be required from students: 
An Act to Establish a State Normal School 
MIcHIcAN 
General Laws, 1849, page 157, No. 138. 
Sec. 1. “Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
State of Michigan, that a state normal school be established, the ex- 
clusive purpose of which shall be the instruction of persons, both male 
and female, in the art of teaching, and in all the various branches that 
pertain to a good common school education; also, to give instruction in 
the mechanic arts, and in the arts of husbandry and agricultural chem- 
istry, in the fundamental laws of the United States and in what regards 
the rights and duties of citizens.” 
Sec. 13. “Those pupils who are admitted to the said school as provided 
by the ninth section of this act, shall not be charged for tuition or for 
the use of any apparatus, or for attendance on any lectures for one 
year.” 
An Act for the Establishment and Maintenance of a Normal University 
ILuinors 
Public Laws, 1857, page 299. 
Sec. 7. “ The board of education shall have discretionary power, if any can- 
didate does not sign and file with the secretary of the board, a declara- 
tion that he or she will teach in the public schools of the state . . . to 
require such candidate to provide for the payment of such fees for 
tuition as the board may prescribe.” 
Sec. 8. “The interest of the university and seminary fund, or such part 
thereof as may be found necessary, shall be and is hereby appropriated 
for the maintenance of said normal university; but in no case shall any 
part of the interest of said fund be applied to the purchase of sites or 
for buildings for said university.” 
West VIRGINIA 
Act of Legislature, 1867, Chap. 120, p. 149. 
Sec. 3. “The Regents may also admit into said school such number of 
students from this or any other state who may not desire to become 
teachers of common schools, as they may deem proper, and upon such 
terms as they may prescribe.”
-P-A-G-E-17
Historical Development 9 
An Act Authorizing Board of Trustees to Examine Applicant for 
Intention to Teach 
WASHINGTON 
Session Laws, 1889-1890, p. 281. 
Sec. 8. “The board of trustees may, in their discretion, require any appli- 
cant for admission into said school other than such as shall, prior to 
admission, sign and file with said board a declaration of intention to 
follow the business of teaching schools in this state, to pay, or secure 
to be paid, such fees or tuition as to said board shall seem reasonable.” 
CoLoRraDo 
Session Laws, 1889, S. B. 104, p. 409. 
Sec. 7. “Each applicant for admission, except as hereafter provided, shall 
also file with the board of trustees a declaration to engage in the business 
of teaching in the public schools of this state.” 
Sec. 8. Provides for tuition to all such but makes provision for charging 
tuition to others. 
These statutory provisions, quite general throughout the states, 
indicate that from the beginning each commonwealth accepted as 
one of its responsibilities the professional training of prospective 
teachers, either without any tuition or with, at the most, only a nom- 
inal charge. In contrast with such provision for teachers in training, 
it will be noted that other students might be admitted and charged 
higher tuition fees. 
The Problem Stated. It will be the purpose of this study to as- 
certain from data secured from original sources: 
1. How much the selected teachers colleges have expended per 
student during the ten year period ending July 1, 1923 
(Chapter IT). 
2. How the expenditure on the part of the state for teachers in 
training compares with state expenditure in other higher 
educational institutions (Chapter II and Chapter III). 
3. How the size of an institution affects unit costs (Chapter III). 
4. How the states have regarded their original policy of “no tu- 
ition for prospective teachers” as reflected in student fees 
(Chapter III). 
5. How the fiscal support of state teachers colleges is affecting the 
equipment, e.g., the library facilities of those institutions 
(Chapter III). 
6. The relation of budget preparation and appropriation procedure 
to proper fiscal support (Chapter IV).

Method Adopted. The study is based on a selected group of 
cooperating teachers colleges. The criteria that were used for 
selecting the group were the following: 
1. Sectional representation, including the following states: 
East Middle West 
Massachusetts Michigan 
Bridgewater Ypsilanti 
Fitchburg 1 Kalamazoo 
Framingham Mt. Pleasant 
Salem Minnesota 
Worcester St. Cloud 
South Winona

2. Limited to state teachers colleges, on a four-year collegiate level. 
3. List to include the institutions that have been granting degrees 
the longest time. 
4. Large, medium sized, and smaller colleges to be included. 
5. Representative colleges working under various types of boards of 
control organizations, e.g.: (a) Central state board for all 
higher educational institutions in state (Kansas); (b) one 
board for all state teachers colleges (Minnesota); (c) sep- 
arate board for each college (South Carolina). 
6. The study to be limited to the colleges in the states selected in- 
terested enough in the project to furnish the detailed informa- 
tion required. 
These criteria of selection, it is maintained, furnish an adequate 
basis on which to conduct the study. The codperating colleges un- 
doubtedly represent a group far above the median of teacher train- 
ing institutions throughout the country as regards size and adequacy

of support. In the group of states selected are to be found distinct 
types of teacher training organization: 
1. The State-Wide Plan. In Iowa the distinct teacher training 
institutions are concentrated in one college. 
2. Limited Divisional Plan. In Michigan a small number (four) 
of relatively large teacher training colleges prevail. : 
3. Small Institution Plan. In Massachusetts the policy has been 
to maintain a relatively large number (ten) of small teacher 
training institutions, making them somewhat local in 
patronage. 
In selecting the colleges to codperate in this undertaking no at- 
tempt was made to secure data from those institutions that would 
present the situation as it exists in the worst cases in relation to 
fiscal support. The purpose was to secure the facts relative to those 
colleges in states that have been at least representatively progressive 
relative to the financial support of teacher training institutions. 
Colleges not included in the study can conduct a self-survey to estab- 
lish their own relative standing. The interest in this subject is 
evident when it is considered that the colleges in every state, ten- 
tatively selected for this project, accepted the invitation to codperate 
in the undertaking. 
Source of Data. The data on which the computations have been 
made were secured directly from the administration offices of the 
coéperating teachers colleges. The data for the first nine years rel- 
ative to the universities and agricultural colleges were secured from 
the statistics published relative to those institutions annually by the 
Bureau of Education. The data for the year 1922-1923 were re- 
ceived directly from the executive offices of the universities and 
agricultural colleges included in the comparisons.

  CHAPTER II 
UNIT COSTS—1913-1923 
PER-STUDENT COST 
In studying fiscal problems the question of unit costs is most per- 
plexing. Up to the present, educational institutions have given so 
very little attention to the cost of each type of service, and the 
records are so incomplete, that it is impossible to present an accurate 
scientific study that will yield definite, reliable, and final unit costs. 
It has been generally agreed that the “student clock hour” is the 
most satisfactory measure proposed. However, when it is recalled 
that the purpose of this investigation is to study trends for a period 
of ten years, 1913-1914 to 1922~1923 inclusive, it will be readily 
understood that all of the data necessary for a determination of costs 
on a student clock hour basis were not available in the institutions 
selected. Some other method had to be used. 
It is obviously not logical to take the total enrollment for a year, 
since many of the students were served by the institution for only 
one term; others remained only for a few weeks, and as is the case 
in most colleges, some students withdrew only a few days after 
registration. After carefully considering the entire situation, it was 
decided to use as a basis for this portion of the study the formula 
followed at the University of Washington by Edwin B. Stevens.* 
According to that plan the “carrying load” of the institution is 
determined by the following procedure: 
1. Use the number of students as of a census date for each term. 
2. Combine these figures and divide by number of terms in a 
year ; two for semesters, three for quarters. 
3. Summer school figures will be seen to affect the carrying load 
only in proportion to the length of the regular academic year; e.g., 
summer session of six weeks enrolling 1200 would be evaluated in 
an institution on the three-term plan as follows: 
1 Stevens, Edwin B. (Univ. of Washington), “Cost Accounting in Universities,” 
Educational Review, p. 226 (Oct. 1920).

This reduces summer school enrollment to the basis of the regular 
year and puts all institutions, whether they have a summer session or 
not, on a comparable basis. 
The colleges selected for this study were requested on the data 
sheet to “report the enrollment (exclusive of withdrawals) as it 
was during the fourth week of each term.” Provision was made on 
the blank for three terms during the regular year and two terms of 
six weeks each for the summer session. 
In determining the per-student cost, capital outlay was disre- 
garded, and the following elements admitted, under Current Ex- 
penses. = 1000 “carrying load” 
Current EXPENSES 
1. Salaries 
Administrative and clerical 
Instructional 
Janitorial and all others 
2. Maintenance and Operation 
Heat, light, water, supplies (instructional and janitorial), printing, 
postage, travel 
3. Library 
4. Miscellaneous 
Special current expenditures (other than capital outlay), not otherwise 
covered 
The number of students with which any institution was credited 
during each year was determined as explained above. That number 
was the divisor. The total expenditure for current expenses, as 
outlined, was used as the dividend for each year. The executed 
division yielded the per-student cost for each year. The median 
cost for the colleges studied for the ten-year period was found to 
be $211.36, as stated in the summary presented in Table III.

  18 Fiscal Support of State Teachers Colleges 
SUMMARY 
It will be observed from Table III that the range of per-student 
cost in the state teachers colleges during the decade was from $75.00 
to $99.00 ; and $750.00 to $774.00. The lowest cost reported, $81.80, 
was at Concord, West Virginia, during the year 1914-1915. This 
low figure is partly accounted for by the fact that at that time the 
institution was largely on a secondary level. The highest cost re- 
ported, $761.00, was at Hays, Kansas, during the year 1918-1919. 
The enrollment data for that institution reveal the fact that the small- 
est student body of the decade was enrolled during that year. 
Table V gives the median per-student expenditure for each year 
from 1913 to 1923. The per-student cost reached the lowest point 
of the period during the years 1915-1916 and 1916-1917. The 
highest median per-student cost, $276.25, was reported for the year 
1920-1921. The decrease following that date is accounted for 
largely by the increased enrollment. 
The median cost per student in 1913-1914 (Table IV) was 
$162.50; in 1922-1923 it was $239.59, a loss of 17 per cent based on 
the index number revealing the purchasing power of the dollar. 
During the past ten years the median expenditure for each teacher 
trained one year in the teachers colleges included in this study has 
been $211.36. During the same time the universities and agricul- 
tural colleges reported in Table VI have spent $412.50 per student. 
Table VII relative to student costs in universities and agricultural 
colleges indicates the range during the decade 1913-1923 to be from 
$150 to $175 and $1450 to $1475. The median is $412.50. The 
lowest reported cost ($158.72), it will be observed, was at the Uni- 
versity of Washington during the year 1914-1915. It is interesting 
to note that the low point in the teachers college group also was 
reached in the same year. The highest cost reported, $1458, oc- 
curred during the year 1918-1919 at the Massachusetts Agricultural 
College. The enrollment data indicate that the student body that 
year was smaller than at any time during the decade. 
Here again, the facts parallel the findings in the teacher college 
group,—the highest per-student cost and also the smallest enrollment 
prevailed during the same year, 1918-1919. 
As stated in Table VIII, the median percentage of total expen- 
diture, excluding capital outlay, devoted to salaries for instruction

is 58.14 per cent. The study involved a total of 146 fiscal years as 
reported by nineteen teachers colleges. The range is from 35 per 
cent to 72 per cent. The table states three other facts that are of 
interest, namely, the median for 1913-1914 is 56 per cent; for 1918- 
1919, 58 per cent; for 1922-1923, 59 per cent. This indicates that 
the percentage of total expenditure, exclusive of capital outlay, de- 
voted to instruction increased from 56 per cent to 59 per cent in the 
ten-year period. While the increase may have been less than it 
should have been in that time, it at least reveals a trend in a com- 
mendable direction. Moehlman, in his survey of the Michigan 
Normal Schools, sets up 70 per cent as the proper percentage to be 
devoted to instruction in a well-balanced budget. When we con- 
sider that the median reported by the Bureau of Education for 
fifty normal schools was 53.6 per cent for the year 1919-1920, it

  20 Fiscal Support of State Teachers Colleges 
seems hardly probable that the figure set by Moehlman is practical. 
However, until such time as our teachers colleges have greatly in- 
creased their enrollment, thereby decreasing the administrative and 
operating unit costs, we can hardly expect to approximate the 
larger percentage. A suggested standard for the present is 65 per 
cent. 
RELATION OF ADMINISTRATION TO TOTAL EXPENDITURES 
To determine what teachers colleges were paying for administra- 
tive and clerical services, the data sheet called for a specific item rel- 
ative to that expenditure under “Current Expenses, I. Salaries, 
a. Administrative and Clerical.” The reports are found in Table IX.

Median, 1922-23 = 7.62% 
From the data reported, the per cent of total expenditures, ex- 
clusive of capital outlay, devoted to administration was computed. 
The median for the ten-year period is 7.06 per cent. The median for 
the last year of the study, 1922-1923, is 7.58 per cent, indicating 
but a slight increase. 
While this represents what these institutions have been expending 
for administrative purposes as far as salaries are concerned, it does 
not reveal to what extent they are furnishing the administrative 
service they ought to supply. Until such time as we have available 
the results of studies supplying definite and scientific standards for 
guides, each teachers college will do well to consider its administrative 
system critically to determine how well its important functions in 
this direction are being discharged. The rather meager information 
at hand points to two outstanding defects: 
1. The teaching members of the faculty are at present called upon 
to assume too much administrative and clerical work, resulting either 
in overburdening them or in seriously crippling the major purpose 
for which they were appointed. 
2. Many of the important administrative services which a teachers 
college should render to its student body are either neglected entirely 
or performed superficially and with a woeful lack of human interest. 
With these two facts prevailing, rather than accept the established 
median, it would seem the part of wisdom to set as a provisional 
guide g per cent of the total sum for maintenance to be devoted to 
administrative salaries.  
-P-A-G-E-30
  22 Fiscal Support of State Teachers Colleges 
Moehlman suggests that a balanced budget should carry an item of 
15 per cent for administration. His recommendation is based on 
the data secured from the four normal schools in Michigan. It is 
not justified by the findings of this wider study. Accepting as a 
basis the median for administrative salaries, as determined from the 
data submitted by fourteen teachers colleges, 1922-1923, 7.62 per 
cent of the total expenditure, an increase to 9 per cent ought to cover 
the present inadequacy in administrative service. The studies in 
Michigan and in Washington? indicate that other administrative 
expenses are approximately one-third as much as salaries. That 
would require 12 per cent of the total expenditure to be devoted to 
administration. This amount should make it possible for a teachers 
college to render all of the administrative service required, including 
the offices of president, bursar, registrar, dean of women, and faculty 
stenographers.

CHAPTER III 
FACTORS AFFECTING FISCAL ADMINISTRATION 
RELATION BETWEEN SIZE OF INSTITUTION AND PER-STUDENT COST 
A question of primary importance in the fiscal support of teachers 
colleges is, “‘ What is the relation between the size of the student 
body and the per-student cost?” The data from the teachers col- 
leges involved in this study indicate a negative correlation of — .69 
=+ .074 between enrollment and per-student cost during the year 
1922-1923." 
From this study it is evident that the larger the enrollment, the 
smaller the per-student cost. The enrollment of the institutions in- 
volved ranged from 192 to 3137. While it is not contended that 
this study is conclusive, it is at least indicative of a basic fact that we 
have too often neglected. No one would claim that a teachers col- 
lege would need to have 3000 students to be financially efficient or 
economical. However, it can hardly be expected that one with an 
enrollment of 200 can be as economically administered as can one 
with a larger student body. Of course, much depends on the type 
of service and training offered. Supplementing this computation, the 
same colleges were compared by the same method for the year . 
1913-1914 and a negative correlation of — .39 was found. These 
two correlations indicate now, though the various elements that enter 
into unit costs are higher than they were ten years ago, that in financ- 
ing our higher educational institutions we should eliminate the waste 
whenever possible. 
To secure additional information relative to the factor of enroll- 
ment in determining cost, still another computation was made. All 
of the teachers colleges having an enrollment of fewer than 600 
students in 1922-1923 were eliminated from consideration and in 
comparing size and cost of the remaining group, a negative correla- 
tion of — .38 was found. By discarding from consideration the 
smaller schools, then the correlation changed from — .69 to — .38, 
indicating quite clearly that schools having fewer than 600 students

tend distinctly to increase the per-student cost. This conclusion 
seems to be justified: The smaller teachers college can be maintained 
only at a greater cost per student or on a lower service and profes- 
sional level. 
STUDENT FEES—THEIR RELATION TO TOTAL EXPENDITURES 
As stated in the first chapter, state teacher training institutions 
were generally established under statutes which declared that pros- 
pective teachers would not be required to pay tuition and in the few 
cases where any fee was permissible, it was to be extremely small. 
To what extent students have been required to pay fees is clearly 
presented in Table X.

The summary on student fees (Table X) states that the median 
per cent of total expenditure paid by the students during the ten-year 
period is 9.22. A further analysis of the data reveals some interest- 
ing facts. The median per cent ten years ago was only 7.37, while 
last year it was 10.5. This amount may seem small; it represents, 
however, an increase of 42 per cent. Moreover, there are two fac- 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  Factors Affecting Fiscal Administration 25) 
tors operating toward a continued increase, namely, (a) the tendency 
for the state not to furnish large enough appropriations for mainte- 
nance, and (b) the continued rise of fees in private and other state 
institutions for higher education. It is not within the scope of this 
study to consider the arguments on which fees may be advanced in 
other educational institutions. These arguments, however, are not 
applicable to state colleges devoted to teacher training. The inade- 
quate supply of teachers for public schools and their meager and 
deficient training make it inexpedient for the state to consider placing 
any considerable fraction of the cost of maintaining these profes- 
sional schools upon the students. The close relation that necessarily 
exists between our form of government and an efficient system of 
public education, dependent upon a well-trained staff, makes inde- 
fensible any further rise in student fees as they apply to prospective 
teachers. 
For comparative purposes data showing the relation of fees to 
total expenditure in universities and agricultural colleges are pre- 
sented in Table XI.

MAXIMUM SALARIES PAID PROFESSORS 
The major item of expense in operating a college is salaries for 
instruction. Many of the teachers colleges do not have a definite, 
clearly differentiated salary schedule with a distinct classification 
based on professional status. The data sheet, however, requested 
information relative to the instructional staff in the following form:

  It was not the purpose of this section of the study to determine the 
percentage of the instructional staff in the various groups or to as- 
certain the relative number receiving the maximum and minimum 
salaries in each group. The purpose was to compare the maximum 
and minimum salaries throughout the decade among the teachers col- 
leges and between those professional schools and the universities and 
agricultural colleges in the same states. 
A summary table giving a comparison of the maximum and mini- 
mum salaries for teachers colleges for 1913-1914 and 1922-1923 is 
presented in Table XII. For comparative purposes analogous data 
from the universities and agricultural colleges are reported in Table 
XIII. 
On examining the maximum salaries paid in these two types of in- 
stitutions, it will be observed that while in 1913-1914 the median

maximum salary of professors in universities and agricultural col- 
leges exceeded median maximum salary for professors in teachers 
colleges by only 25 per cent in 1922-1923 the former group exceeded 
the latter by 37 per cent.

It is interesting to note that the median maximum salary ($2450) 
in the teachers college group in 1913-1914 became the median mini- 
mum salary in 1922-1923. In the university and agricultural college 
group the median minimum salary of 1922-1923 not only equalled the 
median maximum salary of 1913-1914 but exceeded it by more than 
4 per cent. This indicates that in both the upper and the lower 
ranges of the salary scale the per cent of increase was less in the 
teacher training group than in other state colleges. 
Translating the median maximum salary of 1922-1923 by means 
of the index number,’ it is found that the typical teachers college 
professor received in that year a salary 14 per cent smaller than he 
was paid in 1913-1914. 
From the original data, it was observed that the one state (Iowa) 
in the group studied which has centralized its teacher training work 
in one college has had the smallest per cent increase in its median 
maximum salary during the decade, and that it now holds the lowest 
1Index number given by Bureau of Labor Statistics, U. S. Department of Labor, is

salary scale in that respect for the entire group. The college show- 
ing the greatest per cent of increase in a similar classification during 
the same period is Marshall College (West Virginia). The Iowa 
institution is also next to the lowest in median minimum salary for 
1922~1923- 
It may be pointed out that the professors in our state teachers col- 
leges, according to the data here presented, are in a group which 
receives a median maximum salary of $3683; the professors in the 
agricultural colleges and state universities in these same states find 
themselves in a group which receives a median maximum salary of 
$5100. Continuing the comparison: 
Ittrnots pays its teachers college professors a maximum salary of $4650 and 
its university professors a maximum salary of $7500. 
Kawsas pays its teachers college professors a maximum salary of $4500 and 
its university professors a maximum salary of $6500. 
Minnesota pays its teachers college professors a maximum salary of $3600 
and its university professors a maximum salary of $6000. 
Iowa pays its teachers college professors a maximum salary of $3000, its 
university professors a maximum salary of $6500 and its agricultural col- 
lege professors a maximum salary of $6,000. 
MicuicANn pays its teachers college professors a maximum salary of $4500 
and its university professors a maximum salary of $8000. 
AVAILABLE LIBRARY EQUIPMENT 
Relation between number of students in the institution and the 
number of volumes in the library. In a college devoted to the train- 
ing of teachers the library has a twofold function,—to place at the dis- 
posal of the student the best books in literature, art, sciences, and all 
other branches of knowledge, as well as books containing the best 
thought and current practices in the strictly professional field. Li- 
braries should be well staffed, and funds should be provided for main- 
taining them at an ever-increasing point of efficiency. The financial 
data, however, indicate a very limited support of this important fac- 
tor in teacher training. The facts presented in Table XIV indicate 
that, instead of a general increase in the number of reference books 
available for each student, 50 per cent of the colleges reporting have 
had a decrease. While the falling off has been slight,—the general 
average of reference books for each student being twenty-three vol- 
umes in 1913-1914 and only twenty-one volumes in 1922~1923,—the 
figures are significant. At a time when we should be improving the
-P-A-G-E-38
    30 Fiscal Support of State Teachers Colleges 
amount of cultural and professional reference material accessible for 
students, we are actually diminishing it. The teachers colleges re- 
porting the largest growth in enrollment show, in general, the greatest 
decrease in the reference material available.

Factors Affecting Fiscal Administration 31 
In addition to this disturbing revelation there are two other regret- 
able conditions. A consideration of the tables presenting the facts 
regarding the libraries shows the barrenness of reference materials. 
What can be expected in a teachers college that in 1913-1914 offered 
reference material only to the extent of six, seven, ten or fifteen books 
per student? And yet two of those colleges report a decrease in 
1922-1923 of from seven to six and from fifteen to eleven volumes 
per student. 
This condition is primarily a fiscal problem. Teachers colleges do 
not have special library appropriations,—Marshall College, Hunting- 
ton, West Virginia, is the only one that reports this to be the case. 
The money for books must be taken from general appropriations for 
current expenses, the same as heat, light, water, supplies, etc. Since 
those funds are uniformly low, and since the expenditure for the 
items named is imperative, the library needs are generally neglected. 
Table XIV reports the following facts relative to the libraries in 
nineteen teachers colleges for the year 1922-1923: (a) enrollment, 
(b) number of volumes in library, (c) expenditure (exclusive of 
salaries), (d) expenditure per student, and b and c checked with the 
standards as tentatively set up by Professor Willis Kerr, chairman of 
the Committee on Normal School Libraries of the National Educa- 
tion Association.* 
According to these standards a teachers college should have for 
an initial student body of 500 a library of 30,000 volumes and a 
book fund of $6000 annually. For each additional group of 500 
students or major portion thereof, provision should be made for 
13,000 additional volumes and $3000 more each year for books. 
These proposed standards may or may not be justifiable, but they 
at least suggest norms against which the present support of teachers 
college libraries may be checked, and they are the only guides at pres- 
ent available. 
The array of facts reveals great variation in library expenditures. 
The per-student expenditure median for 1922-1923 was $3.83; the 
range was from $.87 per student in Pittsburg, Kansas, to $9.90 per 
student in Cedar Falls, Iowa. This great divergence cannot be ex- 
plained on the basis of previous conditions of the library since the 
institution making the smallest per-student expenditure had less than 
1Kerr, Willis, “Report of the Committee on Normal School Libraries,” Addresses 
and Proceedings of N. E. A., pp. 502-05, 1921.

25 per cent as many volumes as the college making the more adequate 
expenditure, although the enrollment at Pittsburg is 77 per cent as 
large as at Cedar Falls. Pittsburg with an enrollment of 2428 stu- 
dents reports a smaller library than Bridgewater with an enrollment 
of 463 students. 
To check the colleges with the Kerr standard, it will be advisable to 
group them according to enrollment. 
Group I with 500 students should have a library of 30,000 volumes 
and an annual book fund of $6000.

An examination of Table XIV will indicate how far below these 
standards each college in this group fell. The median per-student 
expenditure for library books in this group was $4.25 instead of 
$12.00, as set up by the standard; and the median library has 12,500 
volumes instead of 30,000 volumes as required by the standard.

stead of the 56,000 required on the basis of the Kerr standard. 
Group IV represented by Rock Hill, South Carolina, reports a 
student expenditure of $1.43 instead of $7.50 as set up by the 
standard. It reports a library of only 25,582 volumes when the 
guide calls for 69,000 volumes. 
Group V represented by Pittsburg, Kansas, reports the lowest per- 
student expenditure ($.87) for a library among the colleges studied, 
and a library of only 15,700 volumes. The standards call for an ex- 
penditure of $7.20 per student and for a library of 82,000 volumes. 
Group VI represented by Cedar Falls, Iowa, reports a per-student 
expenditure of $9.90, the highest in the list. It is the only college 
studied whose annual book funds not only equal, but exceed, the 
amount set in the standard. While it has a very good library of 
65,000 volumes, the standard set requires 95,000. 
This rather brief presentation indicates that the teachers colleges 
are far below the standards set for library development. This con- 
dition is primarily a fiscal problem. They do not have special library 
appropriations. The money for books must be taken from a general 
appropriation for current expenses,—water, heat, light, and supplies. 
Since such funds are generally extremely limited, and fixed charges 
must be met, library needs are neglected. This situation can best be 
remedied by making provision in the budget for a specific appropria- 
tion item for this purpose.

CHAPTER IV 
BUDGETARY AND APPROPRIATION PROCEDURE 
THE BUDGET 
An analysis of present practice in teachers colleges reveals a rather 
limited appreciation of the fundamental value of a well-constructed 
budget. Often the budget is prepared by the president with but 
little consultation with other members of the faculty. The extremes 
are represented by the institution that confines its requests for sup- 
port for the next two years to a single typewritten page and by the 
college that presents its budget claims in a carefully prepared seventy- 
page printed bulletin. 
Importance. The budget is too frequently considered only a finan- 
cial statement. It is more than this; it is more than an accounting 
system. A trained accountant can produce an excellent balance sheet, 
can produce a clear statement of past expenditures, and might even 
prepare an estimate of the needs for the coming biennium; but he can- 
not prepare a budget for a teachers college since its preparation de- 
pends upon policy and involves principles of social and professional 
service. 
The budget, then, is of fundamental importance. Its preparation 
requires a knowledge of the purpose, history, probable development, 
and present conditions of the institution. When completed, it will 
determine the activities of the college, the quality of the faculty, the 
adequacy of the educational offerings, and the consequent social 
service of the college as determined by the number and character of 
the teachers whom it prepares. 
Accountant vs. Social Service Conception. A review of legislation 
since 1909 indicates a growing tendency to centralize the budget- 
making machinery in each commonwealth. The higher educational 
institutions are being placed under the same budgetary control as the 
governmental departments. Political campaigns are often conducted 
on an “ economy ” basis. The messages of governors to state legis- 
latures furnish ample illustrations of the prevalence of the conception 
34 
 
-P-A-G-E-43
  Budgetary and Appropriation Procedure 3 
that the primary purpose of a budget is economy. Educators face 
the alternative of placing before boards of control and legislative 
bodies the needs of our teachers colleges either in terms of the ac- 
countant or in terms of social service. The accountant’s conception 
says: “ Our teachers college received last year an appropriation of 
$150,000; the public demand for economy and retrenchment neces- 
sitates that the amount be reduced for next year to $135,000.” The 
social service conception says: “ Our schools are staffed with poorly 
prepared teachers, 67 per cent without any professional training; we 
are unable to provide dormitory facilities for half of the students who 
would like to take the preparation our college offers; the state is 
paying 17 per cent less for training each teacher than it paid ten 
years ago. To meet the needs of supplying properly prepared teach- 
ers in this state the following budget proposals have been carefully 
determined.” 
Basis. Of primary consideration is the question, “ On what basis 
should the budget be prepared?” With the prevailing tendency to 
reduce budgets as they pass from one official board or body to an- 
other, should the proposal be “‘ padded” at the outset so that the 
reduction will not impair the efficiency of the institution? 
Two policies are prevalent: first, the plan that is based on the 
theory that the legislature will cut and, therefore, that the estimates 
must be “ padded ”; second, the plan that holds rigidly to the idea 
that only legitimate amounts should be requested regardless of the 
possibility of cuts. The first plan is neither scientific nor honest but 
tends to keep our higher educational institutions classed among the 
non-professional and the unbusinesslike. It must be admitted that 
there are some instances in which institutions have for a time pros- 
pered unusually well on such a basis. But the prosperity is tempo- 
rary and the management of the college on that basis cannot long hope 
to retain the unqualified respect and support of the best elements in 
any state. What we need to do at this time, especially, is to discard 
every questionable operation and practice, determine the best business 
and professional basis on which to proceed, and then carry on the 
campaign for institutional development in accordance therewith. 
The following statement from a very successful teachers college 
executive is submitted as indicative of the best practice in this regard: 
I do believe, however, that it pays an institution as it pays the individual to 
be open, conservative, and honest in dealing with a legislature.
-P-A-G-E-44
36 Fiscal Support of State Teachers Colleges 
It has been my policy through the years to ask for exactly what I expect to 
get, and then stand for it to the end. 
A second question is, “ By whom should the budget be prepared?” 
At present the prevailing practice indicates that it is prepared by the 
president. However, as indicative of a better procedure, the fol- 
lowing suggestions, as reported by individual presidents, are sub- 
mitted. 
From thirty-six to seventy-two per cent of the appropriations for 
general maintenance in teachers colleges is spent for instructors’ 
salaries. Since that is so large a part of the budget and concerns so 
many individuals, the wisdom of an advisory committee on salaries is 
apparent. One president reports that “ the section relative to salaries 
was prepared after many conferences with the advisory committee on 
salaries. That advisory committee on salaries comprises five faculty 
members elected by ballot of all faculty members.” 
While the president should doubtless be the one finally to pre- 
pare the budget that goes to the governing board, there is much to 
be said in favor of having both the department and every individual 
on the staff make known their wishes and needs concerning equipment 
and supplies. One president has devised a blank to place in the hands 
of each faculty member, asking for a definite statement of items 
needed by him during the period covered by the next legislative ap- 
propriation. The advantages are apparent. It causes the individual 
to forecast possible developments and take a keener interest in the 
administration of the institution. It also gives the president informa- 
tion concerning needs which he might otherwise overlook. He and 
his executive committee will naturally act on all proposals, modifying 
them as their combined judgment may dictate. 
Form. After carefully examining all of the budgets submitted, it 
was evident that none entirely met the requirements of an ideal budget. 
Rather than select one from among the best, which might have several 
defects, it was decided to outline under this heading a composite 
budget. In the following presentation every recommendation is 
based on actual practice as reported by some teachers college. While 
it is not contended that the offering below represents the final word 
in budget-making, it is hoped that the plan and its explanation will 
commend itself to the executive who is anxious to have teacher 
training institutions operated as efficiently as possible.

1. “ While we have no library quarters worthy of mention, and 
with an enrollment of over 4000 students a year, the 12,000 books 
now in our library are so inadequate to meet even a small part of 
the demand as to make it imperative that we ask for a special ap- 
Propriation of at least $5000 for additional books.” 
2. “The 1921 legislature appropriated for extension work and 
maintenance of every department the sum of $38,000 for each year. 
We asked at that time for an appropriation of $50,000. The amount 
has proved absolutely inadequate as we knew it would at the time. 
We spent for maintenance and extension work alone last year $45,- 
192.80. -This amount was practically all spent before March 1 of 
the year, and we were compelled during the last quarter of the year 
to deny departments supplies and material which they greatly needed 
for the successful prosecution of their work.” 
3. “ During the past biennium the college has been pitiably limited 
in its expenditures for general purposes. ‘The library, petty repairs 
and equipment, printing, travel and many similar kinds of expendi- 
ture have been held down far below the line of wise spending, and 
as a result the work of the college has been starved in many re- 
spects. With an enrollment enlarged by seventy per cent beyond 
that of two years ago such expenditures must necessarily be much 
larger than was thought necessary at that time.” 
4. “ Although I was instructed by this board to reduce our request 
for support to an amount not exceeding 15 per cent larger than the 
budget of the present year, I am unable to do this under my respon- 
sibility to you for the proper conduct of the institution. I believe 
that I can prove to you that such a reduction would make it impos- 
sible to keep up the standards of the college and train teachers ef- 
fectively. 
“ The present budget was made up when the fall attendance of the 
college was 392 and in making my recommendations, I planned an 
organization to take care of 450 students; the amount I asked for 
was considerably reduced by the board at that time. In planning 
for the coming two years we must start with a fall attendance of 
662 as against 392, an increase of nearly 70 per cent. It seems evi- 
dent that an institution seventy per cent larger cannot be run on an 
appropriation fifteen per cent larger.” 
REASON FOR FORM PRESENTED 
General Statement. The board of control and the legislative com- 
mittees, as well as the entire legislative personnel, need to know in 
general terms the size, extent, and development of the teachers college. 
The information outlined briefly will tend to arouse their interest in 
   
-P-A-G-E-49
  
Budgetary and Appropriation Procedure 41 
the institution. The age of the buildings will indicate, in the case of 
old structures, the necessity for planning for replacements. The 
total estimated value of the plant will be a source of pride to them 
as responsible citizens and will serve to indicate how comparatively 
small are the current requests for capital outlay. In cases where no 
appropriations have been made in recent years for new buildings that 
fact can be strikingly set forth. 
Enrollment Data. A growing concern, a prosperous industry, is 
more easily financed than is one that is not developing. In the com- 
mercial world capital is more readily secured in those localities that 
already have successful plants in operation. A straightforward, eas- 
ily understood statement relative to the growth in enrollment is a 
good asset in getting additional financial support from legislative 
bodies. 
Service of the College. It must always be kept in mind that a 
teachers college is a social service institution and that the budget 
must rest on that conception. The training of teachers is centered in 
these colleges and the efficiency of the public schools is largely de- 
pendent upon the service they render. It is highly important that a 
statement of their financial needs be prefaced with a statement of 
what they have recently accomplished. 
Additional Considerations. Under “A, Current Expenses ” it is 
suggested that the first column be headed, “ Current Year.” That 
statement is used instead of “ Current Appropriation ” for a specific 
purpose. In many colleges the appropriation for salaries is insuf- 
ficient to cover the needs of the institution, and student fees are used 
to relieve the deficit that would otherwise be incurred. If the college 
is obliged to use student fees for that purpose during the current year 
and the Current Payroll amounts to Appropriation + Student Fees, 
it will be much easier to get the financial committee of the legislature 
to grant the increase required than it would be to make the appropria- 
tion asked for if Current Appropriation was used,—because. the 
difference is smaller under the proposed plan. This will protect the 
students’ interests and serve to check the tendency to increase student 
fees. 
Recommendations. The following recommendations are made 
concerning the budget, its preparation, its defense, and its administra- 
tion:

-P-A-G-E-50

13: 
14.

. Give each member of the instructional staff an opportunity to 
submit an estimate of his needs concerning equipment, sup- 
plies, and assistance during the coming appropriation period. 
Prepare printed blanks for that purpose. 
The proper administrative officers should be permitted to ap- 
pear before the finance committee of the legislature to de- 
fend the budget proposals. 
If reductions are to be made in the proposals, they should be 
returned to the executive of the college for that purpose. 
The president, through the financial agent, the treasurer or 
bursar, is the proper individual to direct the compilation and 
make the presentation of the budget. 
In the preparation of the budget estimates, the president should 
counsel with his executive committee and department chair- 
men concerning the amounts of money to be requested. 
Unit costs furnish the basis for presenting the budget in the 
most easily comprehended manner. 
Supply each member of the board of control with a complete 
copy of the budget several days in advance of the meeting 
at which it is to be considered. 
. Have the budget printed. 
10. 
+1: 
12. Make ample provision for the summer session. 
Be prepared to give the reasons for each amount requested. 
In a biennial budget, base the needed income on the last preced- 
ing year,—not on the entire biennium. 
To provide for the natural growth of the institution, the second 
year of the biennium should contain a larger estimate than 
the first year. (Often legislative committees insist on the 
two years being equal. If that idea is to prevail, make the 
items in “ Current Expense ” larger the second year and in 
“ Capital Outlay ” smaller the second year.) 
After its adoption the administration should follow the budget 
as to its major classifications, keeping faith with those who 
helped in its preparation, and with the legislative members 
who made the appropriation. 
APPROPRIATION PROCEDURE 
While there are many points in common in the procedure followed 
by the several states in securing appropriations for teachers colleges,
-P-A-G-E-51
  Budgetary and Appropriation Procedure 43 
there are enough variations to make the consideration of these modi- 
fications desirable. The material for this section has been secured 
from correspondence and conferences with presidents of teachers 
colleges, and an examination of statutes. 
Type I. Indiana. The Indiana State Normal School gets its 
financial support from a statewide tax levy. The amount of the levy 
is one cent and the income from that source is above a half million 
dollars. The State Normal School board draws proceeds from this 
levy twice a year. 
Indiana has a statewide budget system. It does not apply to the 
three higher educational institutions. These three institutions, how- 
ever, voluntarily use budget systems based on the forms prescribed by 
the State Budget Commissioner. 
The law provides, “On or before the 15th day of October, 1922, 
and biennially, thereafter, each and every department of the state 
government, except the General Assembly, must file with the State 
Examiner of the State Board of Accounts a written statement or 
budget on forms to be furnished by said State Examiner.” 
The most unusual part regarding fiscal support in Indiana is stated 
in a letter from the president at Terre Haute to the effect that “ Our 
budget does not go before the legislature or any state organization of 
any kind.” The income is the result of a fixed levy as indicated above. 
The general result of the system is expressed by the president in the 
following statement : 
“T am strongly in favor of the budget system as it is applied to our institu- 
tion. The best way to provide money for the support of state educational 
schools is through general taxation as we have it here in Indiana. Our Board 
can take the money derived from taxes and all other sources and spend it to 
the best interests of the Normal School. We are not under the necessity of 
securing in advance the approval of any outside group for our proposed ex- 
penditures. We are, however, more than anxious to keep in step with the 
general state budget system and are ready to show to any inquiring taxpayer 
at any time that we spend our money according to a budget and that we are 
getting full returns for every expenditure.” 
Type II. Minnesota. A second type of fiscal procedure is illus- 
trated in Minnesota. The situation in that state is outlined by one 
of the presidents as follows: 
1. “ All of the six state teachers colleges of Minnesota are under one board, 
the State Teachers College Board. 
2. “ This board is charged by the legislature with the duty of reporting to
-P-A-G-E-52
44 Fiscal Support of State Teachers Colleges 
the Governor, three months before the meeting of the legislature, a 
detailed budget for all of the colleges, with reasons for any increases 
that may be asked. 
3. “The Governor combines these budgets, having the right to reduce them, 
if he may judge best, into a single budget, which goes before the 
legislature. 
4. “ The State Teachers College Board is obliged to defend its budget before 
the financial committees of the two houses; these committees have 
practically the final decision on the amounts to be given to such insti- 
tution. 
5. “Reductions are made arbitrarily by the finance committees on no par- 
ticular basis.” 
The budgets are handled before the legislature by a committee from 
the board and no lobbying whatever is done by the individual institu- 
tions in behalf of their own appropriation. 
Type III, Illinois. A third type of fiscal procedure relative to 
teacher training institutions is to be found in Illinois. Its operation 
and results are explained by one of the presidents as follows: 
“For six years we have been under the Civil Administrative Code. Under 
this system we make out an estimate of our needs about four months before 
the assembling of the legislature. These estimates are sent to a Budget Com- 
mission over which the Governor is the head. 
The work upon this commission is done chiefly by the Director of Finance, 
and by a subordinate official known as the Secretary of the Budget. 
After the budget estimates have been properly pruned and the budget made 
up, we are given a hearing, that is, an opportunity to protest against the prun- 
ing. In some cases we are successful in mitigating the severity of the cut, 
but not in many. 
A bill is then framed by the Budget Commission and introduced into the 
legislature. In the last three legislatures in which we have operated under this 
system we have usually found it impossible to secure any but the most trifling 
amendments of this bill, The exigencies of the war and the distresst condition 
of the farmers since the war have made it impossible to secure the appropria- 
tions that this institution has needed. 
We especially need additional buildings. Two of the Illinois state institu- 
tions were granted gymnasiums at the very end of the session of the last 
legislature, but the amount granted was much less than is needed to erect ade- 
quate buildings.” 
Type IV. Massachusetts. Another type of procedure is found in 
Massachusetts. All budget proposals for the normal school go first 
to the Commission of Education and then to the Budget Commis- 
sioner. The law governing the same is as follows:
-P-A-G-E-53
  Budgetary and Appropriation Procedure 45 
Every officer having charge of any office, department or undertaking which 
receives an annual appropriation of money from the commonwealth, including 
annual appropriations to be met by assessments, shall annually, on or before 
October fifteenth, submit to the budget commissioner statements showing in 
detail the amounts appropriated for the current’ fiscal year, and estimates of the 
amounts required for ordinary maintenance for the ensuing fiscal year, with 
an explanation for any increased appropriations recommended, and with cita- 
tions of the statutes relating thereto, together with any other information re- 
quired at any time by the budget commissioner. The said estimates shall not 
include any estimate for any new or special purposes or objects not authorized 
by statute. 
Type V. West Virginia. Still another type of procedure is to 
be found in West Virginia where each president in that state pre- 
pares his budget in November (even numbered years) and submits 
it to the State Board of Control. This is a body of three men ap- 
pointed by the governor to direct the business affairs of all state 
educational institutions. This board holds a joint session with the 
State Board of Education and the president of the college. The 
state board consists of the state superintendent of schools and six 
additional members appointed by the governor and charged with the 
administration of the educational affairs of state institutions. At 
this joint session an agreement is reached relative to the budget. It 
then goes before the Budget Commission, which consists of all of the 
elective state officers. That body is charged with the responsibility 
of drafting a budget bill which covers the amounts agreed upon for 
all state institutions and departments. The bill is introduced into 
the legislature when it convenes in January. That body may re- 
duce but cannot increase any item. It is here handled through the 
usual committee procedure. 
Type VI. Mississippi. A sixth type is illustrated by the plan fol- 
lowed in Mississippi. The budget is prepared by the president of 
the college and presented to the board of trustees. After it has re- 
ceived its approval, it is sent to the governor and is included in the 
state budget and is presented by the governor to the legislature. 
The bill for the appropriation is then drawn, either by the legislative 
committee or by some friend of the college. It is then advanced in 
committee and on the floor of the legislature by the friends of the 
institution. 
The six types of appropriation procedure outlined represent in im- 
portant respects the general plans now in use. Nearly every state has

deviated in some particular from one or another of these types as it 
has seemed best when adapting it to a peculiar state organization. 
While the satisfactory operation of any plan relative to appropriations 
for educational institutions is dependent in large measure upon the 
type of men selected to staff the executive and legislative branches of 
our state governments, experience indicates that our likelihood of 
securing adequate support for education is greatly decreased as we 
increase the number of successive bodies to which the proposals must 
be submitted. The general attitude is one of reduction. To over- 
come that difficulty the plan outlined under Type I has much to com- 
mend it. In addition to the evidence bearing on this type already 
reported the following extract from a letter from Tennessee is sub- 
mitted : 
“Until the current year the East Tennessee State Normal School, since its 
establishment by act of the General Assembly in 1911, had been supported by 
a fixed per cent of our state general education fund, which was 33 1/3 per cent 
of the gross revenue of the state. This was a most satisfactory arrangement, 
as it gave us a definite and increasing income from the state. The General 
Assembly this year, however, was unfriendly, in a measure, to the State Normal 
Schools and to the State University. After a hard fight the State University
-P-A-G-E-55
    
Budgetary and Appropriation Procedure 47 
retained its fixed income but the support for the Normal Schools was taken 
from the general education bill and placed in the general budget. This action 
forced the reduction of the appropriation. 
We are not pleased with our present status and propose, before the next 
General Assembly, to make an attempt to restore the Normal Schools to their 
former place. It has been our observation that when state educational institu- 
tions must depend for their fixed income upon biennial legislative action, that 
the results are not satisfactory or wholesome. 
Of course, special appropriations for new buildings and enlargements may 
properly be made matters of legislative action but the operating expenses should 
be more securely determined.”
-P-A-G-E-56
  CHAPTER V 
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
The facts regarding the fiscal support of a selected group of teach- 
ers colleges are before us. The primary importance of the public 
school system in our form of government is generally admitted. 
However, a study of the data herewith submitted cannot fail to give 
the impression that the state teacher training institutions are not 
supported in a way that will tend toward the realization of the de- 
sired goals in public education. Two aspects of the situation com- 
mand attention. First, public schools staffed with untrained teachers, 
as many of them are to-day, cannot reasonably be expected to be 
efficient. Second, teachers colleges must be charged with the respon- 
sibility of making available a well-trained teacher for every school. 
Administrators of these colleges should be able to tell the public, 
in terms that can be understood, exactly what it will cost to meet 
the situation. It is more important now than before, with costs for 
every factor in education at a level higher than they were a few years 
ago, that an analysis of expenditures should be made to determine 
what each element entering into teacher training costs. With care- 
fully determined unit costs available, the appropriating bodies can 
then be told what it will require to furnish the state with an adequate 
supply of superior trained teachers. When boards of control and 
legislative bodies are told what it will cost to train one teacher each 
year and how many teachers the state needs to have prepared, the 
numbers in each case to rest on established facts, the funds will 
either be provided or the responsibility for the failure will be located. 
To date, the public has not been informed as to these specific items. 
We have no reason to believe that the taxpayers of any states are not 
as much interested in providing the funds necessary to train teachers 
properly as they are in supplying appropriations for educating citi- 
zens who do not expect to teach. The task confronting state teach- 
ers colleges is to prepare an adequate personnel of teachers at the 
lowest cost consistent with the best professional preparation. It is as 
much a part of their task to keep costs down as it is to keep standards 
up.

  Summary and Recommendations 49 
How can the obligations relative to fiscal support of these profes- 
sional colleges best be met? Facts established in this presentation 
lead to the following recommendations : 
1. Keep the per-student cost at a minimum by increasing enroll- 
ment at small institutions. The section of this study dealing with 
the relation of size of institution to per-student cost indicates that 
the smaller institutions (less than 600 students) are not conducted as 
economically as are the larger ones. Such institutions are either 
operated at a higher per-student cost or on a lower professional level. 
Educational administrators cannot justify either procedure. The 
alternative is to establish teachers colleges on a high level, staffed by 
capable educators. If adequately equipped, they will present an 
appeal to prospective students that will result in securing a superior 
body of not fewer than six hundred students. 
2. Increase salaries. The enlarged student body will require the 
appointment of new faculty members. Teachers of superior ability 
cannot be recruited and retained on present schedules. As the sec- 
tion dealing with salaries indicates, the median maximum salary for 
professors in teachers colleges was 14 per cent lower in 1922-1923 
than it was in 1913-1914, when the index number revealing the pur- 
chasing power of the dollar is used. 
Now that state teacher training institutions are organized on a 
collegiate level, devoting all of their resources to preparing high 
school graduates to teach in the public schools,—rural, elementary, 
and secondary,—it is expedient that they be staffed with a faculty 
equal in scholarship and at least equal in teaching ability to the facul- 
ties of other state colleges and universities. One comparative item 
relative to salaries should be considered at this point. 
As the data in the section on salaries set forth, in 1913-1914 the 
median maximum salaries for teachers in state colleges and universi- 
ties exceeded a corresponding classification in teachers colleges by 22 
per cent. In 1922-1923 that increase had advanced to 37 per cent. 
Should the state not expect to pay a professor as much to teach men 
and women to teach, as it pays them to farm, or to build bridges? To 
secure virile, superior men and women with strong personalities for 
the faculties of teachers colleges, a salary schedule must be maintained, 
that is, at least equal to the best in the state. 
3. Protect the prospective teachers against the increase of fees. 
The statutory provisions cited in Chapter I stated the policy of the
-P-A-G-E-58
  50 Fiscal Support of State Teachers Colleges 
state relative to tuition charges in teachers colleges. The section de- 
voted fo student fees clearly portrays a marked tendency to nullify 
those provisions. During the decade student fees have increased 43 
per cent. While they are not prohibitive in any section as yet, if 
considerable care is not exercised by responsible administrative of- 
ficers, the fees may be increased to a dangerous point. We cannot 
afford from the standpoint of public service to have any part of the 
increased fiscal support of these professional schools supplied by the 
teachers in training. 
If, however, any of these colleges adopts the policy of admitting 
young men or young women who are not preparing to teach, the 
board of control is justified in establishing for such students the 
same schedules of tuition and fees as are operative in other state 
colleges not devoted to the preparation of teachers. 
4. Establish a cost accounting system. In making this recommen- 
dation it is not proposed that finances should be the main considera- 
tion in conducting any educational institution. Finances are of sec- 
ondary importance. The service of the college is of primary impor- 
tance. If, however, the factor of secondary command is not most 
carefully considered, the service of the college will be interfered with. 
It is in this respect that higher educational institutions have erred too 
often. In collecting data for this study, the need for more nearly 
adequate accounting systems was felt by all executive officers. Col- 
lege administrators who have been working longest on this phase of 
their problem agree that adequate accounting has made it possible for 
them to give to their boards, and subsequently to finance committees 
of the legislature, facts relative to their colleges that have increased 
the fiscal support for their institutions. A monthly financial state- 
ment indicating the total costs by items will be of value in making 
subsequent budgets. 
5. Build better budgets. More nearly adequate accounting sys- 
tems will furnish a part of the information necessary for an improved 
budget. The section of the study dealing with this topic closes with 
an outline of a proposed budget which embodies principles that have 
been used advantageously by college executives. If the additional 
support these professional schools need is to be secured, it will be 
necessary to present their claims in a more businesslike manner than 
they are presented at present. The successful executive, whether of 
an educational institution or of an industrial plant, must have data
-P-A-G-E-59
  
Summary and Recommendations 51 
that will make it possible for him to analyze every phase of the under- 
taking. With such information he will not only be enabled to answer 
the questions that are likely to arise as to the worth of various proj- 
ects, but he will also have the detailed information out of which a 
better budget can be constructed. 
From the data involved in this study and other comparative esti- 
mates relative to the division of the budget, the following recommen- 
dation is made: : 
          Administration . 
Instruction 
Auxiliary Agencies (including library) ....................00085 8 
Operation of Building . 
Maintenance 
This division is not submitted as a final goal but as one that furnishes 
reasonable objectives for the present. 
When the facts are assembled, it is not unlikely that many teachers 
colleges will face the necessity for relatively large increases in their 
budgets. If the analysis of any institution reveals the need for 
greatly increased support, the executive must take the responsibility 
for preparing a budget that will secure the needed amount. Increases 
of more than 100 per cent in legislative appropriations have been se- 
cured for teachers colleges relying almost entirely upon a well-con- 
structed and clearly presented budget at a time when the institutions 
were advancing to a collegiate level. 
In conclusion, teachers college executives, if the institutions are to 
be adequately supported financially, need: 
1. To realize fully the professional obligations which their institu- 
tions face. 
2. To know the facts concerning the cost of training a teacher in 
their college, and in similar schools in other states. 
3. To build and defend a budget that will make it possible for those 
professional colleges to meet the responsibilities the public 
expects them to meet, namely, a trained teacher for every 
school.

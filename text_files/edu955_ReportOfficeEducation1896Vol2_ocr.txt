FEDERAL AND STATE AID TO ESTABLISH HIGHER 
EDUCATION.! 
The interpolated “university grant” connected with the “ ordinanco of 1787"—The grant for 
colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts of 1862—Estimate of the gross 
sum received for the sale of these lands—The management of the lands for which Mr. Cornell 
bargained with the State of New York—Expressions of opinion which justify provision for 
the dissemination both of culture and utilitarian knowledge by Government—The effort 
of the States to foster higher education—The method of Massachusetts, of New York, of 
Virginia, and of Michigan selected as illustrations--The present time marked by the desire 
of the people to directly tax themselves specifically for higher education—Summary, by 
States, of Federal and State aid for the purpose of establishing universities and colleges. 
In the United States the establishment of higher institutions of learning has 
been promoted by one or more of five agencies, which are, respectively, the Fed- 
eral Government, the several State governments, the churches, private individuals, 
and the promoters of business enterprises. These agencies have so cooperated as 
to make it impossible to state exactly the financial part each has played in estab- 
lishing, much less in maintaining, higher education in the country. Nevertheless 
it is possible to give with some degree of accuracy the amount of public aid for 
promoting a project which was first distinctly connected with free government in 
the Massachusetts constitution of 1780 and subsequently repeated, enlarged in mat- 
ter and condensed in form, in connection with the so-called ‘‘ ordinance of 1787,” 
or constitution for the new States that were to be formed in the interior of the 
continent, This original provision of the constitution of Massachusetts reads as 
follows: 
Wisdom and knowledge, as well as virtue, diffused generally among the body of 
the people, being necessary for the preservation of their rights and liberties; and 
as these depend on spreading the opportunities and advantages of education in the 
various parts of the country, and among the different orders of the people, it shall 
be the duty of the legislatures and magistrates, in all future periods of this Com- 
monwealth, to cherish the interests of literature and the sciences, and all semi- 
naries of them; especially the university at Cambridge, public schools, and gram- 
mat schools [in the English sense, or secondary] in the towns; to encourage 
private societies and public institutions, by rewards and immunities, for the pro- 
motion of agriculture, arts, sciences, commerce, trades, manufactures, and a 
natural history of the country; to countenance and inculcate the principles of 
humanity and general benevolence, public and private charity, industry and 
frugality, honesty and punctuality in their dealings; sincerity, good humor, and 
all social affections and generous sentiments among the people.®

2 In his Life of Alexander Hamilton, Mr. William Graham Sumner, professor of political and 
social science in Yale University, remarks: ‘“‘The facts which we have now presented suf- 
fice to show that the great faults in the public affairs of the United States at this time (the 
régime of the Continental Congress) were indolence, negligence, lack of administrative energy 
and capacity, dislike of any methodical, businesslike system, and carelessness as to money 
responsibility and credit. A man with experience of the world finds that there are few things 
to be got for nothing. His mind inevitably reverts to the cost or the equivalent. He reduces 
his expectation to the measure of the equivalents he can give. In these observations we have

1138 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
For the propagation of this extraordinary announcement, due to the genius of 
the man who became the first Vice-President and second President of the United 
States, see Note A of this chapter. 
I, FEDERAL AID, 
In 1787 Congress passed an ordinance for the government of the territory north of 
the Ohio, then lately converted into public domain through the relinquishment of 
their claims by the States of Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, 
and Virginia. This ordinance carefully provided for the interests of elementary 
education, but said nothing for those of higher education. But under the stimu- 
lating influence of a determined and highly educated scientist and minister of the 
gospel, who was negotiating at the time for the purchase of 5,000,000 acres of land 
in the territory for which the ordinance had been drawn, a provision was incor- 
porated in the subsequent act authorizing the sale of the lands whereby ‘‘ not more 
than two complete townships” were ‘‘ to be given [to each State] perpetually for 
the purposes of a university, to be applied to the intended object by the legislature 
of the State.” The precedent thus made has been deprived of its casual impor- 
tance and has been made a rule for the advantage of every new State. 
The sale of the lands thus granted for the establishment of a university in each 
new State was subject to the action of its legislature. Thus there was necessarily 
an opportunity left for experimenting with the lands until experience had taught 
its lesson. The newer States of Minnesota (1858),1 Kansas (1861), and Nebraska 
(1867) profited by the experience of their predecessors, and in doing so have pro- 
duced results which are phenomenal in the popular management of public lands. 
The disasters and vacillation attending the early action in regard to the university 
lands, some States receiving their quota before admission, make it difficult to 
ascertain exactly what sum was obtained from the sales, and to this difficulty 
must be added that in many cases the lands were sold on long time. In Ohio the 
lands were leased for ninety-nine years at a valuation of $1.75 an acre, and though 
in 1804 this valuation of the lands amounted to $70,000, in 1883 it was found that 
they were assessed at $1,060,000, yet the university was only receiving at that 
date an income of $2,400 instead of $63,600 from the 46,000 acres which had been 
granted in 1787 for the establishment of a university. Further, it is said by the 
board of regents of the University of Wisconsin that lands which were sold in 
1850 at $25 an acre were sold by that State in 1849.at $3. But by far the greatest 
difficulty encountered in computing the amount received from the sales is to 
separate the university fund from the fund arising from the sale of lands given 
by the Federal act of 1862 and from State aid given regularly or occasionally. It 
will therefore be well to state first the amount of land received by each State from 
the Federal Government, which, being a matter of fact, should be kept quite sep- 
arate from certain estimates as to the amount those lands were sold for, to be 
made hereafter. 
  
the clew to the career [during the organization of this G@overnment?] of Alexander Hamilton.” 
Excerpted from pages 101-103. But the article of the constitution of Massachusetts was written 
by the hand of another Federalist. Cf. Philbrick, in his article, Etats-Unis, in Buisson’s Diction- 
naire de Pédagogie, Ire partie, page 922; also Barnard’s report as Commissioner of Education 
for 1868, pages 86 and 87, where an interesting circumstantial account is given of the origin of 
the “scientific” and Mr. Adams’s fear for the “‘good humor” clause. 
1In the first constitution of Minnesota (1858) it is provided that not more than one-third of the 
school lands may be soldin two years, one-third in five years, and one-third in ten years, but the 
lands of greatest valuation shall be sold first, and no lands shall be sold otherwise than at public 
sale.

ing one half of 1 per cent of all proceeds derived from sale of United States lands 
nship was granted to Territory and given to Vincennes University, which sold 4,135 acres for $6,000. When the State was admitted, another township was given to Indiana Univer- sity, and subsequently still another township. ‘including one-tenth of lands granted to State as “saline,” 4,600 acres. 4'Three sections were also granted (in addition to 2 townships) by treaty of Fort Meigs in 1817. These realized $5,000. peak 5Of which 1,284,240 belong to the new States and the Territories of the Plains and Rocky Mountain region. 
In 1862 Congress passed an act for the purpose of establishing institutions for 
the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts, without excluding other scien- 
tific studies and the classic languages. The means provided to accomplish this 
purpose were, including Colorado’s share but not the share of any State admitted 
since 1876, some 9,600,000 acres of public lands—‘‘the land grant of 1862”—as is 
particularized below:

Here are 13,000,000 acres, that is to say, 20,000 square miles, of selectable lands 
granted by the Federal Government specifically for the establishment of higher 
education. The question is, How are they to be valued? for, as before remarked, 
there is no possibility of discovering, without long and patient research among 
the archives of each of the State capitols, what sum the lands were really sold for, 
or exactly how much money came into thp nands of the State, or even for what 
particular educational purposes the amounts received were expended. To this 
want of precision in regard to the amount received from the lands, and as to 
the number of acres unsold, or, if sold, yet to be paid for, must be added the far 
less important difficulty that about 1,234,000 acres of the university lands and 
about 850,000 acres of the grant for agricultural and mechanical colleges—in Utah  
-P-A-G-E-12
1140 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
  specifically for an agricultural college—belong to the new States of the far West. 
But as these lands thus granted to the new States are potential but not actual 
endowment, or, as it is called, ‘productive funds,” we are more particularly con- 
cerned with the States admitted before 1889. 
The United States valued such lands as it gave to the new States of the far 
West at $10 an acre, or $6,400 a square mile. If valued on this basis, the lands 
given by Congress during the century, up to 1889, for the purpose of establishing 
higher education of all kinds would amount to $108,000,000, or, including the 
grants since 1889 (2,084,000 acres), $129,000,000. The magnitude of the figure 
($108,000,000) as compared with the amount now held by each State institution 
as an endowment fund from the sale of university and other lands for higher 
education shows at once that $10 an acre is entirely too high as an average valua- 
tion of the lands granted by Congress since 1803 to the date of the acts which 
admitted the States of the Rocky Mountains. 
In placing these lands upon the market the earlier States that came into the 
Union felt the competition of the lands still held within the State or elsewhere by 
the United States. These lands the United States were offering at the uniform 
price of $1.25 an acre, The advantage of the States was that they could select 
the best lands, and their policy in disposing of them was the Fabian policy of 
delay. Without lingering in these generalities or dwelling on the difficulties of 
legislative management of public property to be placed upon the market, an inci- 
dent may be related of the possibilities offered to such management. The land 
scrip issued to many of the States in compliance with the act of 1862 was being sold 
in some cases at 50 or 60 cents an acre in the open market. The State of New 
York had 990,000 such acres. These were going at the market rate named when 
Mr. Cornell made a proposition to the State to buy the whole body of scrip yet 
unsold at 60 cents an acre, to be paid for as resold, provided the scrip be placed in 
his hands for location and that all obtained for the lands above 60 cents an acre 
become an endowment for a university. The proposition was accepted, the 
scrip was skillfully located in the white-pine forests of Wisconsin, all premature 
longings and solicitations of too-impatient people were resisted, and the lands were 
eventually sold for $6.73 an acre on the average. As a result the Cornell Univer- 
sity hasa fine endowment, a monument not only of the public spirit but of the 
pusiness sagacity of Mr. Cornell and Mr. Henry W. Sage, who so ably effected 
their splendid project, not by benefactions, but by their personality, the element 
by which ‘‘ benefactors” accumulate their wealth. The State of Kansas has also 
done well by the lands granted. It deliberately fixed the price of its university 
lands so high that after some years it was necessary to reduce the price one-fourth 
to get them on the market. Nor is Kansas alone in her judicious management of 
the fund granted by the people of the whole country to the several States formed 
from time to time out of the Federal territory. 
Still it is not fair to take the results obtained by exceptionally good manage- 
ment as the average price for the 10,800,000 acres given by Congress up to 1889. 
The United States lands were sold in the early days of the century for $1.25, and 
that figure may seem to be the average value of public lands. But it is to be 
remarked that when the Government-aided railroads were constructed the price 
of public (United States) lands along their routes was doubled with good reason. 
So would it be in a State into which immigrants were rushing. To be admitted, 
the State must have been fairly settled in the American sense of being run over 
by a prospecting population, and the internal-improvement movement of the 
twenties and thirties was aiding in the construction of thoroughfares. It there- 
fore does not appear to be an extravagant estimate to place the average value of 
the 10,800,000 acres at $2.50. Thus we obtain $27,000,000 instead of $108,000,000 
for the 17,000 square miles of public lands given by the Federal Government up 
to 1889, Yet small as this amount is, it seems too large. It is a fair statement to 
 
-P-A-G-E-13

  place the price received for the 9,600,000 acres of land given in 1862 for the estab- 
lishment of colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts at $1.10 an acre.’ On 
that assumption it will follow that $10,500,000 was received for the lands. This 
amount is a little more than is indicated by the principals of the fund, held sepa- 
rately by the several States, which principals considered as one fund yield, interest 
estimated at 6 per cent, about $600,000.? 
The university lands, however, were not thrown on the market, like the agri- 
cultural and mechanical college lands, in an immense block during a distressing 
period of the country’s history, so that scrip was sold for 60 cents an acre, as in 
the case of New York, or 55 cents, as in the case of Pennsylvania, or 54 cents, as 
in the case of Ohio, and soon. These university lands, all told, up to 1889, were 
1,244,902 acres. Deducting from these the lands given to Colorado, Mississippi, 
Louisiana, and Tennessee, it is probable, from returns and estimates, that the 
983,622 acres remaining brought about $4,016,000, or about $4.08 an acre, which 
will compare favorably with the sales of Cornell University which had about the 
same quantity and for it obtained $6.73 an acre. Let us assume that $4.08 an 
acre will be a fair average price for the whole body of 1,244,902 acres, and it will 
be found that these lands yield $5,000,000 for the establishment of institutions for 
the higher education of the minds of the youths of the several States. Putting 
these two grants—one for spiritual and the other fox technical or scientific edu- 
cation—together, it will be seen that the value to higher education of the 17,000 
square miles given by the people of the United States to the several States before 
1889 was in the neighborhood of $15,000,000 or $16,000,000. 
The grant of 1862 was insufficient, and the Federal Government again came to 
the aid of the States. In 1890 an act for the ‘‘more complete endowment of the 
institutions called into being or endowed by the act of 1862” was passed. Under 
this act $8,208,000 has been already furnished from the Federal Treasury, and in 
virtue of the act of Congress of 1887 the experiment stations, which are being more 
and more intimately connected with the agricultural colleges, have received 
nearly $8,000,000 from the same source. Thus the sum total estimated and really 
given by the Federal Government as aid to higher education of some kind or 
another is in the neighborhood of $31,000,000 or $32,000,000, to say nothing of the 
future, which now shows an annual offer of about $1,700,000 from the Federal acts 
of 1890 and 1887 alone. 
The uniformity of the legislation of Congress regarding the granting of land for 
the purpose of establishing higher education in the several States as each came 
into the Union was interrupted by the provisions of the act of 1889, which admit- 
ted the States of North and South Dakota, Montana, and Washington. In 1854, 
1855, and 1881 Congress had given to each of the Territories the usual grant of 
two townships, and the Territory of Washington as early as 1855 had established. 
a university at Seattle. On the admission of two of the Territories as States in 
1889 and the subdivision of another into two States, Congress, instead of granting a 
certain quantity of land for ‘‘internal improvements,” another quantity as ‘saline 
lands,” and still another as ‘‘swamp and overflowed lands,” gave large blocks of 
land in lieu of these general unconditioned grants for the specific purpose of 
estublishing institutions for higher education and for charitable purposes and the 
  
1 The attorneys for Cornell University place it at $1.65. But it is their duty to make the most 
of the magnificent management of Mr. Cornell, and they include the sale of 989,920 acres belong- 
ing to New York, not at 60 cents an acre, at which the State sold it, but at $6.73, at which Cornell 
University sold it, or held it. They put the receipts for the sale of the 9,600,000 acres at $15,900,- 
000, $6,188,000 of which being what was obtained over the amount ($473,000) paid by Cornell Uni- 
versity to the State of New York. But in this statement of Messrs. Halliday & Finch, the 
attorneys of Cornell in a friendly suit between that institution and the State, Nebraska is put 
down for $39,000, whereas it is claimed that $600,000 is nearer the mark, as will be found when the 
lands are sold.

‘education of the deaf, blind, and vicious. These lands are to be leased by the 
State until they will bring $10 an acre. They are not to be turned over for the 
use of any institution not belonging to the State. Neither are they to be leased 
for a longer period than five years, nor in larger portions than 1 square mile, nor 
is more than 1 square mile to be leased to one individual or company. The grant 
to North and South Dakota each was, for a school of mines, 40,000 acres; for the 
university, 40,000 (North Dakota getting, of course, two townships in addition), 
and to Washington and Montana 100,000 acres for a school of science, and the 
University of Montana receiving 50,000 acres in addition to the two townships, 
according to precedent. Idaho in 1890 received 100,000 acres for a school of 
science, and 50,000 for a university, and Utah in 1894 received 200,000 acres for an 
agricultural college, 100,000 for a school of science, and 110,000 for its university. 
All told, these lands amount to 2,084,240 acres, which at $10 an acre will yield 
$20,842,400. This sum will swell the total sum actually given by the Federal Gov- 
ernment for the establishment of higher education to the figure of $50,000,000, or, 
to recapitulate these estimates, it appears—

The lands granted since 1889 being priced at $10 or more are, as it were, tied 
up, and are only ‘‘productive funds” as far as they are leased. The University 
of Washington, however, had quite a capital to goon. ‘Two citizens of Seattle 
had given 10 acres of land about 1855 for the university. When the site was 
changed this property was certainly worth $150,000, for the legislature advanced 
that amount in 1893 (to be repaid “from the sale of lots in Seattle”) for the pur- 
pose of providing new buildings for the new university. The tied-up land, how- 
ever, having a value, is utilized in providing buildings by pledging it as security. 
As an instance of this method of using the lands, sections 1, 2, and 5 of an act 
of one of the new States are now given. 
Srcrion 1, That for the purpose of providing money for the support and main- 
tenance of the normal schools of the State of Idaho, located at Albion, in Cassia 
County, and Lewiston, Nez Perce County, and for the construction and repair of 
buildings for the use of said schools, a loan of $75,000°is hereby authorized to be 
negotiated by a board consisting of the governor, treasurer, secretary of state, and 
attorney-general of the State of Idaho, on the faith and credit of the State of 
Idaho, and secured by the proceeds of the sale of State normal school lands and 
the timber thereon as hereinafter provided. 
Src. 2. The treasurer of the State is hereby authorized, empowered, and directed 
immediately upon the passage of this act to issue 75 bonds of the State, to be known 
as normal school bonds, in the sum of $1,000 each, payable in twenty years from 
the date of their issuance, to bear interest at the rate of 5 per cent per annum, pay- 
able semiannually on the ist days of January and July each year, at a bank in 
the city of New York to be selected by State treasurer; said bonds, however, to 
be redeemable at the option of the State at any time after the expiration of ten 
years from the date of their issuance. 
Src. 5. For the purpose of securing the payment of the principal of the bonds 
provided for in this act the proceeds of the sale of all the lands, or of timber grow- 
ing thereon, granted to the State by the United States for State normal schools 
are hereby set apart as a separate and distinct fund to be known.-as the normal 
school sinking fund; and after the payment of said principal of said bonds, then the 
proceeds of the sales of said land or timber shall be paid into the general fund in 
the State treasury until an amount equal to the total amount of interest that has 
theretofore been paid out of said general fund on said_bonds, less the amount of 
interest that may have been paid into said general fund from investment of nor-

mal school sinking fund moneys in State warrants, as hereinafter provided for, has 
been so paid into said general fund. When the principal of said bonds shall have 
been fully paid and the general fund of the State reimbursed for interest on said 
bonds as herein specified, then and thereafter the proceeds of the sales of such 
lands and timber shall be disposed of as may by law be provided. 
This is not the place to enumerate the merits or to extol the objects of the insti- 
tutions that the university land grants and the grants for the colleges of agricul- 
ture and the mechanic arts have called into being or have encouraged. All that 
has been repeatedly done elsewhere. But attention may be asked to two judg- 
ments which appear to justify the most strenuous exertions in promoting the cause 
of higher education. The first of these dicta relates to higher spiritual education 
and contains a passage very frequently quoted, or rather misquoted; the second is 
from a recent report of a British commission on technical education. 
In the preface to his Questions Contemporaines, Mr. Ernest Renan criticises his 
own and this country in the following language: 
The false idea being still alive in France that education should be given only to 
those children whose social position in after life will warrant it, and therefore that 
to cultivate and to instruct the poor is to sow wants and ambitions which it will 
be impossible to satisfy, nothing can be definitely accomplished until that idea is 
repudiated. The strength of the education of the peasantry in Germany is due to 
the strength of higher education in Germany. It is the university which makes 
the school. It is said that the elementary teacher conquered the Austrians at 
Sadowa.! Notatall. It was German science and German virtue that conquered 
at Sadowa. It was Protestantism, it was philosophy, Luther, Kant, Fichte, and 
Hegel that conquered at Sadowa. ‘The education of the masses is the result of the 
high culture of certain classes. The people of those countries which, like the 
United States, have created a great school system for the people without a serious 
higher instruction shall for a long time yet expiate their fault by their intellectual 
mediocrity, their coarseness, their superficiality, and their lack of general intelli- 
gence.” 
Or if it is proper to take the French literary savant’s “‘instruction of a class of 
persons,” or perhaps as he would have said, ‘‘a class of instructed persons,” as 
meaning the same thing as a “general diffusion of knowledge,” his apprehension 
concerning the defects of education in this country as regards parlor manners 
was antedated nearly a century by a warning as regards politics. In his Fare- 
well Address, Washington said: ‘‘ Promote, as an object of primary importance, 
institutions for the general diffusion of knowledge; for in proportion as the struc- 
ture of government gives force to public opinion it is essential that public opinion 
should be enlightened.” 
Turning from the value of higher education as a preparation for entering into 
the realm of culture and for the discharge of the duties of citizenship, we may 
regard the subject from a purely business standpoint. During the year 1896 a 
British commission visited Germany and reported on the technical education of 
that country. From that report the following quotation is made:* 
In fact, our recent visit has brought it clearly home to us that the Germans 
have not ceased to believe in the value of higher scientific education. On the con- 
trary, they appear now to attach greater importance than ever to the connection 
between such higher scientific training and the development of manufacturing 
industry. Wo nation, especially if not overburdened with capital, would con- 
tinue to erect and equip institutions for advanced instruction and scientific 
research without a firm conviction of their industrial value. The demand, too, 
for such higher teaching seems to increase as the facilities for providing it are

* Report ona visit to Germany with a view to ascertaining the recent progress of technical 
education in that country, being a letter to His Grace the Duke of Devonshire, K. G., Lord

all. (These gentlemen were on a commission that reported about thirteen years ago. See report of this Bureau for 1882-83, pp. 268, et seq.)

enlarged. For whereas in 1884 we stated that the total attendance at the poly- 
technicums was little more than 2,000, the attendance of students at Charlotten- 
burg alone, irrespective of the Berlin University, is now 8,000, while the number of 
students in the physical and electro-technical laboratories at Darmstadt is already 
in excess of the accommodation. Indeed, it is worthy of remark that the same 
object which called into existence some forty or fifty years ago the technical uni- 
versities has recently led to their extension and development in a new direction. 
As far back as that period Germany began to prepare herself for becoming a man- 
ufacturing people. It was her belief in the future application of chemistry to 
industrial purposes that led to the erection and equipment at a great cost of chem- 
ical laboratories and to the encouragement held out to students to pursue their 
studies in those laboratories for a period of five, six, or even seven years. The 
success that has attended the efforts of the Germans to appropriate many impor- 
tant branches of chemical manufacturing industry is well known, and the depend- 
ence of those industries on the researches of chemical experts employed in the 
works is generally recognized. At the Badische Analin-und Soda Fabrik alone 
are now employed 100 scientifically trained chemists and 30 engineers. Her bril- 
liant achievements in the field of chemical industries have encouraged her to 
establish well-equipped electrical laboratories and to develop the practical teach- 
ing of physics with the view of assisting the electrical trades, which are compara- 
tively of recent growth. 
Nevertheless there is a precaution to be taken in all experimentation, not only 
in the fields of intellect and gentility, but in that of industrial education. This is 
to be patient in awaiting returns, especially if inferior methods be used. Pro- 
fessor Atwater, while chief of the Experiment Station Office of the Federal Agri- 
cultural Department, has spoken on this subject to this effect: 
Whoever has had experience in field experiments and has taken the pains to look 
through the mass of reports of such work that has accumulated during the past 
fifty years in Europe, as well as in this country, must be impressed with the small- 
ness of the visible result in proportion to the expenditure of labor, thought, and 
money. The great difficulty is that the conditions, particularly of soil and weather 
[and he might have added social conditions], are entirely beyond not only the 
experimenter’s control, but also his means for measuring them; and what is still 
worse, inequalities of soil which are hidden from his observation are often respon- 
sible for a large part of the differences in yield, so that the results give entirely 
wrong answers to the questions he is studying. While the importance of duplica- 
tion of trials and of continuing them through a series of years can not be too 
strongly insisted upon, it is also very desirable that investigations should be made 
with special reference to the improvement of the methods of experimenting. 
The acts of 1862, 1889, and 1890 have been frequently referred to in the foregoing, 
and it is useful, perhaps, to summarize their provisions as the most important 
efforts made by the people of the United States to foster higher scientific education.

FEDERAL AND STATE AID TO HIGHER EDUCATION. 1147 
STATE AID TO HIGHER EDUCATION, 
The first and all-important active power of Congress is the obligation ‘‘ to lay 
and collect taxes and duties.” It is well known that nothing of this kind has 
been done by that body for higher educational institutions. The millions spoken 
of above have arisen not from taxation, but from the sale of lands. The 
extraordinary slowness with which new ideas, if left to themselves, are dissem- 
inated, so that practically the large mass of people, as Burke says, are fifty years 
behind the times,! has caused the Federal Government to provide agencies for 
the investigation and careful compilation of new conceptions concerning public 
health—intellectual, moral, and physical—and national interests, but no institu- 
tion for the classroom instruction of young persons has been established by the 
Federal Government, except for the education of the officers of the Army and 
Navy, the emancipated slaves, and for the wild Indians. The Federal Govern- 
ment has given lands; it is left to the States to tax the property of its citizens for 
higher education, with which the Federal Government has had nothing to do 
except so far as the acts of 1890 and 1887 are concerned, and the limitations 
imposed by the acts of 1787 and 1862 as to the use of the funds granted during 
those years. Let us see how the States have availed themselves of this privilege 
of taxing themselves for higher education. 
In making this study it is convenient to single out the State of Massachusetts 
for her early action; the State of New York for her administratively comprehen- 
sive action; the State of Virginia for her treatment of the university as the uni- 
versitas scientiarum of the schoolmen, or the ‘‘Einheit der Lehre” of the Germans, 
and the State of Michigan as effecting a sort of hybrid of these three, at first, in 
1817, with marked preference for the Virginia idea, then of the New York idea 
of a university distributed all over the State, and finally of the Massachusetts 
college idea combined with the Virginia idea again, as in the first place, when 
the paper institution on the Jeffersonian plan, called University Michigania, or 
Catholepistemiad, was characterized by the French Revolutionary craze for bastard 
verbal compounds from the classic languages.” 
In Massachusetts, says Prof. C. K. Adams, we find the legislature, before 
the seventeenth century had half run its course, doing six different acts in 
connection with higher education—to wit, by making a grant for a college 
(Harvard), by laying an annual tax to support it, by fixing its location, by super- 
intending the erection of its buildings, by appointing a curator paid by the State, 
by removing an incumbent and appointing his successor. In other words, in 
order to found a college, Massachusetts, though having fewer than 4,000 inhab- 
itants, gave £400 in cash, the annual earnings of the Boston-Charlestown ferry, 
and toa man who had promised that he, as president, would devote his life to 
building up the college 500 acres of land, and when he failed turned him out forth- 
with. This was in 1636-1640. The ministers of George III, one hundred and 
  
1It is very rare indeed for men to be wrong in their feelings concerning public misconduct; 
as rare to be right in their speculation upon th cause of it. I have constantly observed that 
the generality of people are fifty years at least behind in their politics. There are very few 
who are.capable of comparing and digesting what passes before their eyes at different times 
and occasions so as to form the whole into a distinct system. But in bookseverything is settled 
for them without the exertion of any considerable diligence or sagacity. For which reason men 
are wise with but little reflection and good with little self-denial in the business of all times 
except their own. (Present Discontents.) 
*Catholepistemiad—the place where knowledge or all the sciences are taught. A professor- 
ship was called a ‘“didaxia.” Absurdities of this kind are common to revolutions. The French 
Reyolution turned 1793-94 into “the year 1;” so did the revolting Sicilians in their age; so did 
Rienzi. The later scholastics changed their names—Schwartzerde became Melancthon =Dlack 
earth, etc. Mr. Jefferson wanted the States on the Northwest to be called Michigania, Polypo- 
tamia, ete.

forty years later, came with great rapidity to the conclusion that Boston was not 
a good center from which to subdue the rebellion of their fellow-citizens, though a 
decided center of the rebellion, The fact is now accepted—‘ higher education is 
the best national defense.” ‘You are eternally quoting Germany to us,” said a 
member of the French House of Representatives to the minister of public instruc 
tion, Mr. Berthelot, who was addressing that body on higher education. ‘‘ Yes,” 
replied the minister, blandly, ‘‘always Germany. We all very well know why.” 
“Tt was not the schoolmaster that conquered at Sadowa,” said Renan, ‘‘ but Ger- 
man science,” which is just as much as to say ‘‘the German universities.” The 
earliest direct tax for education was imposed for this Massachusetts college 
(1 peck of corn, or its equivalent, 12d.), paid by each family. So much for 
Massachusetts and her college, which all educated Americans regard as an Eng- 
lishman regards Oxford or a Frenchman regards the Sorbonne. 
The State of New York has shown in the management of all the higher educa- 
tional institutions within her borders a sense of the importance of their influence 
and of its own moral duty to supervise as well as to foster them which was mani- 
fested by no other State of the Union until recent years. Her method of treat- 
ment was quite original, being unlike that of the Université de France, which 
came, indeed, shortly after it, and of the University of Oxford, which had preceded 
it many centuries. The French Revolutionary assemblies had early united the 
five great scientific bodies of France into a federal system called the Institut de 
France. This much being accomplished for literature and science, two projects 
were advanced about 1790, one for centralizing and one for federalizing the influ- 
ence of higher education in France. The abbé, politician, and subsequent prince, 
Talleyrand, advocated the first and would have l’institut enseignant (the teaching 
institute or university) centralized at Paris; but the federal system was advocated 
by the celebrated Condorcet, scientist and martyr. Mr. Condorcet remarked in 
the French Assembly, ‘‘ We propose to establish in France nine colleges which 
will be lights shining from many points at the same time, and thus their effect 
will be more equally distributed among the citizens.” The projects fell through, 
until, in 1806, Napoleon created the Université de France, originally intended as 
an examining body, with a grand master at Paris and committees or ‘‘ faculties” 
in the provinces. Far different is the system at Oxford. There, as originally in 
France, the ‘‘ university” is equally unreal as a teaching entity; nevertheless the 
University of Oxford has a definite habitat and is an idea founded on facts, which 
facts are the colleges and halls which have been from time to time established by 
private or royal benefactions as the dwelling place of instruction. Scatter the 
Oxford colleges over the State of New York and increase their number and you 
have made the initial step in conceiving the character of the institution called the 
University of the State of New York. It is an institution sadly needed in other 
States to go up and down testing the fitness of people to begin higher studies, and 
deciding upon the fitness of institutions to be incorporated, especially those 
who wish to be empowered to confer degrees. Pennsylvania has within a year 
adopted, though creating a different agency, this wise administrative measure, 
There is no more substantial monument to the respect paid to the character of 
Mr. Jefferson than the founding of the University of Virginia by that State. It 
was an institution conceived on university lines, in which the curriculum em- 
braced the world of science while preserving the unity of instruction known 
among the Germans as the Einheit der Lehre. It does not appear that there was 
any enthusiasm created among the Virginians for an institution with such an 
ideal. Private colleges were meeting the demands of the people, who were justi- 
fiably satisfied that the education given in those institutions was as good as any 
given elsewhere. Liberty, not science, was the object of their aspirations, and 
they preferred a village Hampden refusing ship money for the use of a tyrannical 
king to a Humboldt traveling about the globe collecting snakes and climbing vol-

canoes. Yet these gentlemen, bred up on Plutarch, Tacitus, and Livy, had the 
distinguished merit to found a modern American university in the year 1817. 
Having once established the university, it became a matter of honor to maintain 
it, but otherwise to leave it to its own resources.! 
“‘The history of State higher education in Michigan,” says Professor Blackmar, 
‘“centers around one institution, but that institution is the foremost university of 
the great West, and, indeed, the first model of a complete State university in 
America.” In 1817 the Catholepistemiad, or University Michigania, was a mere 
paper concern. In 1825 an idea was conceived of having a university of Michigan 
composed of a hundred colleges, something on the order of the University of New 
York, but one to be for the higher education of women, another a normal, still 
another an agricultural department, all focusing in or at the ‘‘ university,” whose 
“regents” were to help support them while the counties did the rest. ‘‘ The exten- 
sive plan early entertained for the branch schools of the University of Michigan,” 
says Mr. Blackmar, who prefers to ascribe this idea to the influence of the Ger- 
man gymnasia, as he does the Catholepistemiad, or University Michigania, to the 
University of Berlin of 1810, for instance, ‘‘resulted in nothing further than the 
establishment of an excellent system of high schools connected directly with the 
university curriculum, but entirely independent of the institution in their support 
and government.” In Michigan the secondary and higher education are knit 
together by mutual understanding; in New York they are connected by a ‘‘ univer- 
sity;” in Virginia the university is still a concentrated establishment, whose sphere 
of direct influence is confined to its own precincts; but none of these things can be 
affirmed of the Massachusetts university at Cambridge. 
Great as are the difficulties of making a thoroughly accurate statement concern- 
ing the endowment in the shape of lands given by the Federal Government to the 
several States, they are greatly inferior to those encountered in attempting to 
relate what the State has given. The legislatures of newly admitted States are not 
always the best informed persons as to the proper disposition of lands and money 
for higher education, and some unfortunate legislation undoubtedly has resulted; 
put it is to be remarked that, bearing in mind the vast quantities of cheap public 
lands still retained by the United States up to 1880, all statements of gross mis- 
management as ‘“‘proved” by meager returns are to be carefully weighed before 
adoption. The first great difficulty with the university fund while it was still 
land was to sell it profitably at an early day; the second, when the land had been 
converted into money, was to invest the money at remunerative rates. Upon 
these rocks of educational land financiering perhaps several legislatures wrecked 
the hopes of an endowment for a State university; and then, in a mood of contri- 
tion for the evil which had followed from their acts, assumed the loss as a debt, 
the interest on which was thereafter to be paid by public taxation. It is judicious, 
therefore, to leave the subject of the management of these funds to the historian 
1Extract from the report of the committee of schools and colleges of the legislature of Vir- 
ginia, against the expediency of withdrawing the $15,000 annually from the University of Vir- 
ginia, 1845, Document No. 41: 
‘“« ® * Tt would, on some accounts, certainly be desirable were our university, like Har- 
vard and several others, sustained entirely or in great part by funds derived from the munifi- 
cence of individuals. But it should not be forgotten that, while by this means the public would 
be relieved from the annual contribution now required, the general interests of the community 
as affected by the operations of the institution would be either wholly neglected or but par- 
tially secured. The‘entire government and organization devolving upon self-elective boards of 
trustees irresponsible to the State would of necessity be exposed to the narrowing influences 
springing from the predilections and prejudices of religious sects and classes of society, and 
the university, by an easy transition, losing the liberal features of a school suited equally to all, 
would become the property and the spoiled favorite of a particular denomination or rank.”

of each State, who can award the praise or blame that a thorough investigation of 
the circumstances warrants. The thirteen original States were saved the vexa- 
tions attending the management of public land grants for higher education. 
At the present day the connection of the State and higher education seems to be 
becoming in certain parts of the United States an explicit arrangement between 
higher education and the people. The money received into the State treasury as 
“taxes” is too nearly the sum actually required for the specific purpose for which 
each tax was levied to allow of legislative munificence in appropriating ‘‘any 
money in the State treasury not otherwise appropriated,” even though the appro- 
priation would have so laudable an object as higher education. This difficulty is 
felt more keenly in the younger and less wealthy States, as it was in the colonial 
days of the States of the Atlantic Coast. In those early days a ferry toll, a tax of 
a peck of corn,'a tax on exported tobacco’? and on imported liquors, negroes, 
and Irish servants? were crude forms of an expedient that the inland States are 
now finding it convenient to adopt. Formerly the mania for lotteries was used to 
provide funds for establishing institutions of higher education, but at the present 
day public morality can not be so hoodwinked by the show of higher education for 
a dummy as to be seduced into an effort to legalize this once popular device. 
The method now coming into vogue is to levy directly a specifically named tax 
upon the taxable property in the State for the support of a State university or, in 
the case of Colorado, for the university, the agricultural college, and the school of 
mines—for each institution one-sixth of a mill. But this is not the only form in 
which this expedient is resorted to. The State of South Carolina has assumed the 
examination of fertilizers and the guaranty of their contents. This work of 
guaranteeing the value for agricultural purposes of artificial manures is the work 
in part of the State experiment station, and the $60,000 that is thus obtained is 
given for the support of the State agricultural college. It is thought that no other 
experiment station produces results more obviously valuable than those of the 
South Carolina station. The endowment is commensurate with the Federal sub- 
sidy and the munificence of Mr. Clemson. 
A list of the States taxing the people directly for higher education is given below: 
States in which the people tax themselves specifically for higher education. (Does 
not include technical colleges unless same are colleges of the university.) 
California (University of California) .—Tax of 1 per cent on $100; in 1898, 2 per cent. 
Colorado (University of Colorado).—Tax of one-fifth of a mill. (Also taxes

on property of three-eighths of a mill, 1873-1897. This yielded but $32,000 in 1873; 
in 1887, $170,000; in.1897, $70,000. 
Ohio (State University).—Tax by State of one-twentieth of a mill (capitalized 
at 4 per cent—$2,250,000), 1891-1895; in 1896, one-tenth of a mill. 
Oregon (University of Oregon).—Tax by State of one-tenth of a mill, 1882-1887; 
tax by State of one-seventh of a mill, 1887-1892; granted by State since 1893, 
$30,000 annually. 
Virginia (University of Virginia).—Annual appropriation, 1818-1876, $15,000; 
annual appropriation, 1877-1884, $30,000; annual appropriation, 1885-1894, $40,000; 
annual appropriation, 1895- 1897, $50, 000. 
Wisconsin (University of Wisconsin).—Tax in 1883, one-eighth of a mill; in 
1891, one-tenth of a mill. Also (laws 1893), for two years an additional State 
tax of one-fifth of a mill for each dollar of assessed value of taxable property for 
increased administrative expenditures, In 1896 these taxes yielded $75,434, $60,347, 
and $120,695. 
The other great purpose for which taxes have been laid by the States to estab- 
lish higher education is a very costly one—the construction of adequate buildings. 
The most conclusive way of arriving at the amount of this species of State taxation 
would be to sum up the value of the grounds and buildings were it not very 
frequently the case that private benefactors have built and presented one or more 
of the buildings or the grounds upon which the university is placed. Despite 
this defect, however, such a method is here adopted; for we are dealing on this 
occasion with the aid furnished by the Federal and State governments to establish 
universities; and had there been no such action on the part of the Government 
there would have been no occasion to present lands to them for sites or to provide 
and furnish science halls and dormitories to facilitate their instruction or accom- 
modate their students. It is thought that such benefactions would not probably 
have gone to other institutions, in the first place, because they are largely given 
by an alumnus in grateful memory of his alma mater, and, in the second, are due 
to a patriotic feeling for the renown of the State. The value of the property in 
the form of grounds, buildings, and apparatus of the institutions named under 
each State, as hereafter given, is $41,000,000. 
On a subsequent occasion it is hoped that it will be possible to present a state- 
ment of the total amount given by the several States to maintain higher educa- 
tion.- In this chapter it is impossible to do more than to give the total amount of 
productive funds reported by the institutions which are named in the summary 
with which the chapter now clcses. The amount of these productive funds, 
including the quasi State universities of Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and Cornell, is 
$51,673,233, of which about $30,000,000 belongs to the four universities named. 
It thus appears that institutions that have been materially aided by Federal and 
State governments possess about $92,000,000 worth of property either as real 
estate and apparatus or as ‘“‘ productive funds.”

  \ MASSACHUSETTS. 
(in the case of this State we are again confronted with the delicate ques- : tion as to the character of the relations of a State-aided university 
and the State. Were the occasion and place proper to attempt to 
answer this question by going into a sociological inquiry as to the 
political ideas of the people who founded the colony of Massachu- setts Bay, it is not improbable that it would be found that those 
ideas were (at that date) an extraordinary mixture of federalism 
and local self-government. Bo this asit may, Harvard College was 
established by the colony in 1640, and the relations of the State were 
not closed with Harvard University at the date of 1863, when Goy- 
ernor Andrews, in advocating the endowment of the university with the funds given by the Federal act of 1862 to Massachusetts, made 
these remarks: ‘‘ That we should continue to build on the foundation 
our fathers laid, endeavoring to make actual in the life of our so- 
ciety their ideal, I religiously believe. Two-thirds of an amount 
equal to the sum we anrually and wisely expend in public and pri- vate instruction would found professorships and furnish the fund 
which would give to Massachusetts a university worthy the dream of Eis phere: the history of the State, and the capacity of her 
people.” Harvard University:

company’s receipts, both going to college 
1 The State assumed $45,000 debts, but reimbursed itself to the extent of $11,250 from the sale of Federal lands, the 1862 act allowing $11,250 for buildings (i. ¢., 10 per cent).

former part of this inquiry. The lands sold by the State yielded about 50 cents an acre; those sold by Mr. Cornell and Mr. Sage 
yielded about $6.73 an acre. Comparatively few acres had been 
sold when Mr. Cornell got hold of the fund by a contract with the 
State whereby he gave 60 cents an acre for the remainder.)

(These lands were leased for 9) years on a capitalization of 6 per cent of their value in 1802. They were to be revalued every 30 
years, but in 1805 a law was passed allowing a lease of 99 years. 
When the supreme court sustained the trustees in their effort to 
value the land in 1835 the legislature passed an act explaining the 
meaning of the act of 1805. This practically gives the 44,000 acres to the holders forever, subject to a rent of 6 per cent on their 
value of 1805; i.e., $70,000, yielding anincome of $4,200. For 82 years 
these lands paid no taxes to State, but in 1875 the university took 
advantage of the clause of the act of 1805 allowing it (the uni- 
versity) to add the value of the tax the State relinquished for the 
benefit of the university to the 6 per cent lease. This was un- 
ayailingly resisted by the lessees, and the university nowr eceives 
about $7, 000 annually from the 44, 000 acres. )

                                                             It may entertain those students of sociology who prefer an array of facts to an 
array of titles of unread books, called a bihogrepiy, to follow the spread of this 
Massachusetts doctrine, which says that liberty is based on wisdom and knowl- 
edge, or perhaps on wisdom through knowledge; for ‘‘ wisdom and knowledge, far 
from being one, have ofttimes no connection: knowledge dwells in heads replete 
with thoughts of other men, wisdom in minds attentive to their own.” Rhode 
Island, it will be remarked, omitted the word “wisdom” in her constitution of 
1842. 
Pennsylvania (1776).—All useful learning shall be duly encouraged and pro- 
moted in one or more universities. Laws for the encouragement of virtue and the 
prevention of vice and fee immorality shall be made and constantly kept in 
torce, and provision shall be made for their due execution, and all religious socie- 
ties or bodies of men heretofore united or incorporated shall be encouraged and 
protected in the enjoyment of the privileges, immunities, and estates which they 
were accustomed to enjoy under the former constitution. 
North Carolina (December, 1776).—All useful learning shall be duly encouraged 
and promoted in one or more universities. See also at close of this note. 
Vermont, 1777, followed Pennsylvania as above. 
New Hampshire (1784), the first State after Massachusetts to adopt a new con- 
stitution.—Knowledge and learning generally diffused through a community 
being essential to the preservation of a free government, and spreading the advan- 
tages of education through the various parts of the country, being highly conducive 
to promote this end, etc. 
Ordinance (Continental) of 1787.—Religion, morality, and knowledge being 
necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the 
means of education shall forever be encouraged (in the States formed from the 
«“Western Territory.”) 
Ohio (1803), the first State made from the ‘‘ Western Territory.”— Religion, mor- 
ality, and knowledge being essentially necessary to the good government and the 
happiness of mankind, schools and the means of instruction shall forever be 
encouraged by legislative provision not inconsistent with the rights of conscience. 
In putting this last clause in, the makers of the constitution of Ohio innovated 
upon the language used by the Continental Congress at the urgent solicitation, it 
issaid, of the Rey. Dr. Cutler, the pastor settled at Ipswich, in Massachusetts, who 
was lobbying the ordinance through so as to purchase some 4,000,000 or 5,000,000 
acres of Ohiolands. Hisown company’s (the Ohio) and the Symmes’ purchase were 
the only instances of the twenty-ninth section of each township being reserved for 
religion. The idea did not take at all like the common-school idea, The makers 
of the constitution express themselves in their bill of rights thus: ‘Religion, mor- 
ality, and knowledge, however, being essential to good government, it shall be 
the duty of the general assembly to pass suitable laws to protect every religious 
denomination in the peaceful enjoyment of its own mode for public worship, and 
to encourage schools and means of instruction.” 
Indiana (1816), the second State of the Northwest.—Knowledge and learning 
generally diffused through a community being essential to the preservation of a 
free government, and so on, like the New Hampshire constitution of 1784. 
Mississippi (1817).—Religion, morality, and knowledge, and so on, like the 
ordinance of 1787. 
Alabama (1819).—Schools and the means of education shall be forever encour- 
aged in this State. 
Maine (1820).—A general diffusion of the advantages of education being essential 
to the promotion of the rights and liberties of the people, therefore, etc. 
Missouri (1821).—Similar to the Alabama, but see below in 1865, 
Tennessee (1835).—Knowledge, learning, and virtue being essential to the pres- 
ervation of republican institutions, and then on like the New Hampshire instrument 
of 1784, 
Arkansas (1836).—Repeating the provisions of New Hampshire exactly; but see 
below, 1868, 
Rhode Island (1842).—The diffusion of knowledge as well as of virtue among the 
people being essential to the preservation of their rights and liberties, etc. 
Texas (1845).—A general diffusion of knowledge being essential to the preserva- 
tion of the rights and liberties of the people, etc., seemingly after Maine (q. v.,1820). 
Minnesota (1858).—The stability of a republican form of government depending 
mainly upon the intelligence of the people, it shall be the duty of the legisla- 
ture, etc.
-P-A-G-E-36
1164 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Missouri (1865).—A general diffusion of knowledge and intelligence, and then 
apparently copies Maine constitution (q. v.,1820, above). 
Nebraska (1867).—Copied Ohio constitution of 1851, which was practically the 
same as the preamble of the constitution of 1803. 
Arkansas (1868).—A general diffusion of knowledge and intelligence, etc. (Of 
Missouri, above.) 
Mississippi (1868).—Same as Minnesota, adding “virtue” to ‘‘intelligence.” 
Arkansas (1874).—Intelligence and virtue being the safeguards of liberty and 
the bulwark of a free and good government, the State, etc. 
North Carolina (1876).—Follows ordinance of 1787. 
California (1879).—Similar to Missouri constitution of 1865. 
South Dakota (1889).—Follows Minnesota constitution of 1858. 
North Dakota (1889).—A high degree of intelligence, patriotism, integrity, and 
morality on the part of every voter in a government by the people being necessary 
in order to insure the continuance of that government and the prosperity and hap- 
piness of the people, the legislature shall, etc. 
Idaho (1890).—Copies Minnesota constitution of 1858, 
The declaration of Maryland in 1864 is unique: *‘ The legislature ought to encour- 
age the diffusion of knowledge and virtue, the extension of a judicious system of 
general education, and the promotion of literature, the arts, science, agriculture, 
commerce, and manufactures, and the general melioration of the condition of the 
people.” 
The declaration of the North Carolina constitution of 1868 is still more remark- 
able: ‘ The people have a right to the privilege of education, and it is the duty of 
the State to guard and maintain that right.”

  CHAPTER XXIV. 
THE FIRST COMMON SCHOOLS OF NEW ENGLAND.! 
By GrorGE Gary Busu, Ph, D. 
“The education of the people ought to be the first concern of a State.”"—Macaulay. 
New England was most fortunate in the character of her colonists. Doubtless 
the first projects of emigration to the New World had their origin in commercial 
adventure and the expectation of a higher political liberty, yet nothing can be 
clearer than that the actual settlers, who fled hither from the ecclesiastical and 
political tyranny of Europe, were filled with thoughts of establishing a Common- 
wealth based upon religion and learning. In their adventurous spirit they might 
perhaps be compared to the Greeks who colonized the lands bordering the Medi- 
terranean, but they differed widely from them in most respects, and especially in 
the measure of their religious faith, and in the intellectuality of the objects which 
they sought to attain. According to the testimony they have left us, they had 
become weary of the corruptions in the church in which they had been born and 
nurtured, and went out to the new England ‘‘ to practice the positive part of the 
church reformation, and to propagate the gospel in America.” But this determi- 
nation to seek a new land was aided much by the great reform movement which 
was then agitating all Europe, and quickening the desires and ambitions of men 
for new fields of activity, wealth, and honor. To the Puritans, accordingly, 
America seemed to offer a proper theater for the development of that ‘‘ master 
principle,” a religious reformation. Exiles from the country they loved, they 
asked only that, ‘‘in quiet insignificance,” they might lay the foundations of civil 
and religious liberty. But these men of such strong convictions who, for princi- 
ple, were willing to pay the price of banishment, were alike worthy of honor for 
the nobility of their lineage and for their high intellectual acquirements. A New 
England writer says that they ‘‘ were the most highly educated men that ever led 
colonies.” ? We shall not then be surprised to find that they devoted themselves 
with such earnestness to the cause of education, being fully aware that without 
the schoolmaster and the schoolhouse nothing could save them from sinking into 
barbarism.* Such was their conviction on this point, that scarcely a lustrum was 
allowed to pass before they placed the schoolhouse beside the church, determined 
that upon these two—education and-religion—they would lay the foundation of

the new government. This was before they had any body of !aws, and when the. 
people, living in a few score log huts, were only numbered by hundreds. Natu- 
rally the first thought of the founders was to so educate the young that they might 
be able to maintain and strengthen the Christian Commonwealth which they had 
established. As often happens, they builded better than they knew. They came 
to establish a theocracy; they established it, They came to establish free schools; 
they established them, but in doing so they laid the corner stones of a great 
Republic. They sowed the fruitful seeds of liberty, in whose abundant harvest 
we are all sharers, 
The Pilgrims, the earliest settlers on the Massachusetts coast, after many vicis- 
situdes and much poverty and suffering, made for themselves a home, and estab- 
lished the first civic community in New England. The idea of this community 
was not an outgrowth of their circumstances or necessities, but it was the Old 
World idea of a community of interests based upon land; and this was “older 
than Saxon England, older than the primitive church, and older than the classic 
states of antiquity.”! Though the Pilgrims have received and justly hold a high 
place in our early history, still they ought not to be honored as the progenitors of 
the dominant New England race. This honor belongs rather to our Puritan 
ancestry, to ‘‘those men illustrious forever in history ”’?—who first in 1630 in the 
Arabella sailed from England, and in the next ten years were followed by 300 ships 
and over 20,000 people. These landed at the mouth of the Charles River, and 
settling on its banks or in the vicinity, soon formed themselves into separate town- 
ships which they named Charlestown, Boston, Newtown (afterwards Cambridge), 
Watertown, Roxbury, and Dorchester. 
In 1633 a happy accession was made to the little colony in the person of the 
Rey. John Cotton. After the coming of Governor Winthrop and his associates 
with the first charter, in 1630, probably the arrival of no other person caused so 
great felicitation, or had a more important bearing upon the future welfare of 
the new colony. One has said that ‘‘in all its generations of worth and refine- 
ment, Boston has never seen an assembly more illustrious for generous qualities 
* * * than when the magistrates of the young colony welcomed Cotton and 
his fellow-voyagers at Winthrop’s table.”? These were men and women who 
were indeed ‘‘ fit to be concerned in the founding of a State.”+ To Mr. Cotton,’ 
who was chosen pastor of the First Church, the praise has been given (justly as 
it would seem) of establishing the first school in Boston. Certain it is that in 
April, 1635, one year and five months after his landing, the free Latin school was 
opened on the north side of School street, ° on the southeasterly portion of ground

works, such as still hold an honored place in our schools and universities. (Emerson’s Educa- 
tion in Massachusétts, p. 18.) 
®Cotton came from Boston in Lincolnshire, England, where, as rector of the ‘‘most stately 
parish church” in the land, he had taken great interest in education. It is known that in the 
English Boston school, Latin and Greek were taught, and it is probable that the American school 
was formed, as far as circumstances would permit, after the English model. Though we have 
no positive knowledge that Mr. Cotton was the founder of the Latin school (see R. C. Waterston 
on Boston Schools, ete., Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc., February, 1873), it would seem natural toa man 
of his ardent temperament, to surround himself with institutions and observances, reminding 
him of his English home; and besides, we do know that the famous Thursday Lectures and 
accompanying Market Day originated with him, and that these had their counterparts in the 
English Boston. 
®The record that assures us of the existence of this Boston school, dated ‘13th of ye 2nd 
month,” says “it was generally agreed upon that our brother Philemon Permont shall be 
entredted to become schoolmaster.” (Mass. Rec. as quoted by R.C. Waterston, Ibid.) Thereis 
no notice of a school among the regular entries of Boston records until 1642. But on the last 
leaf of the first volume is a list, dated 1636, of subscribers and their donations towards a

now covered by King’s Chapel. Probably from the beginning the elementary 
branches were taught, yet it is not a little remarkable, that as designed by the 
founder, it was to be a high school; that is, principally for the study of Latin and 
Greek. 
This design was happily carried out, for it became the principal classical school 
not» only of the Massachusetts Bay, but, according to the Rey. Dr. Prince, 
“of the British colonies, if not of all America.” For its support it depended 
partly upon the donations of liberal friends of education and partly upon the 
income of a tract of land. Barnard, in his life of Ezekiel Cheever,' says that a 
tract of 80 acres at Muddy Brook, now a part of Brookline, was given in 1635 to 
the first teacher, Mr. Permont; and that, besides donations and legacies, the income 
from Deer Island* was received for the maintenance of the Boston school. For 
two centuries and a half this school has enrolled among its members many who 
were destined to occupy high places in the State and nation. Such during the 
first century and a half were President Leverett, of Harvard College, Dr. Cotton 
Mather, Judge Hutchinson, Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Adams, and others whose 
eminent public services form no unimportant part of New England history, As 
one small meetinghouse sufficed for many years for all Boston, so one school met 
all the needs of public instruction until 1682, when other schools for writing and 
arithmetic were established. Whether it was thought an unusual thing to estab- 
lish a free school or aschool of any kind, and whether the leading men of the colony 
were interested in the first Boston school, we have no certain knowledge. Govy- 
ernor Winthrop’s journal, which gives minute accounts of nearly every circum- 
stance affecting the welfare of the colony, makes no allusion to it, nor do we find 
from the same authority any reference to free-school education until some years 
later. At first, both in the Massachusetts and Plymouth colonies, the children 
were doubtless educated at their homes in the elementary branches, while a few 
of the brighter boys were sent to the village pastor to receive from him instruction 
in Latin and Greek. 
In studying the origin of the first American schools a very interesting question 
arises, namely, whether in essentials they originated in America or were largely 
modeled after the schools which had long existed in England. The author of The 
Germanic Origin of New England Towns,* tells us that one of the most curious 
and suggestive phenomena of American history is the reproduction under colonial 
conditions of the town and parish systems of Old England. These little communes 
“‘were the germs of our State and national life. They gave the colonies all the 
strength which they ever enjoyed. It was the towns, parishes, and counties that 
furnished lifeblood for church and state, for school and college, for war and 
peace. In New England especially, towns were the primordial cells of the body 
politic.” ‘‘The town and village life of New England is as truly the reproduction 
of old English types as those again are reproductions of the village community 
system of the ancient Germans.” ‘In the customs of the court leet and of the 
old English parish meeting, which is but the ecclesiastical outcome of the old 
school of this kind. Had this leaf been lost “Boston would have been deprived of its best evi- 
ence to prove the honor of having preceded every settlement of the colony in so honorable an 
enterprise.” (Felt’s Annals of Salem, Vol. I, p. 429.) In the Ninth Annual Report of the New 
Hampshire Board of Education, page 15, I find this reference: “The next year [1636] they 
attempted to maintain a free school, Mr. Daniel Maud being now also chosen thereunto as 
teacher. He was to receive a salary of £40, of which Governor Vane subscribed £10. They also 
assigned a ‘garden plot to Mr. Daniel Maud, schoolmaster, upon the condition of building 
thereon, if need be.’”” In 1638 Permont settled in Exeter, N. H.,and in 1612 Maud came from his 
duties as schoolmaster in Boston to Dover, N. H., both being settled as pastors.

  Saxon self-governing assemblies, is to be found the prototype of the New England 
town meeting.” ! Now, if this be true of the town systems, may not the same be 
said of the New England school system? We are told? that ‘‘the idea of popular 
instruction was brought to the New World by our ancestors in the seventeenth 
century, and has here found its appropriate home.” A free school—that is, a school 
for gratuitous instruction of poor children (and in that sense alone were the early 
schools in this country free) * can be traced back to the early ages of the Christian 
Church. The monasteries were originally seats of learning, as well as places of 
religious retirement, and their cloister schools, which were free, were ‘‘the hearth- 
stones of classical education in every country of Europe, and were the germs of 
the great universities.” In the cathedrals a master was appointed whose duty it 
was to give free instruction both to clerks and poor scholars. 
Admitting that the first Latin school was modeled after the English, it is rea- 
sonable to suppose that the other early schools of New England were formed ina 
similar way, though whatever model was followed it should be remembered that 
the common schools of America originated among the people, and did not, asin 
Germany and elsewhere, owe their establishment to the forethought and liberal- 
‘ity of some princely ruler. We know that in a few years they were established 
in each town about Boston and in New Haven and Hartford—the latter place 
having been settled by Massachusetts colonists.’ These schools varied in effi- 
ciency according to the sums appropriated for their support, the competency of 
the instructors, and the measure of public interest they awakened. The idea of 
these schools was compulsory education, and the liberality with which they were 
generally sustained shows that we have no reason to claim for ourselves a deeper 
interest in educational matters than was taken by our ancestors. This liberality 
found expression in grants of land, in gifts and bequests of individuals, and by 
payments of tuition or rates by parents, or in allowances made out of the com- 
mon stock of the town, which were designed especially for instruction in Latin 
1 Baylies, in his History of Plymouth, Vol. I, p. 241, as quoted by Richard Frothingham, says 
that “the origin of town governments in New England is involved in some obscurity. The sys- 
tem does not prevail in England. Nothing analogous to it is known in the Southern States.” 
Frothingham further says that “Baylies traces their origin to the independent churches,” and 
that “the nearest precedents for the New England towns were those little independent nations, 
the free cities of the twelfth century, or the towns of the Anglo-Saxons, where every office was 
elective. Webster, in his Plymouth oration of 1820, says that it was the division of lands that 
“fixed the future frame and form of this Government.” 
2 Educational Progress in the First Century of the Republic, p. 279. 
8 Originally in England the term free school meant not a school in which instruction was to be 
given without fee or reward, but a public school free from the jurisdiction of any superior insti- 
tution, open to the public of the realm, and in some instances a school of liberal education. So 
at first here in New England, as appears by the records of the towns and of the general court, 
both in Connecticut and Massachusetts, and also in the early acts of Virginia and other States, the 
term was used much as in England, “to characterize a grammar school, unrestricted as toa 
class of children or scholars specified in the instruments by which it was founded, and so sup- 
ported as not to depend on the fluctuating attendance and tuition of scholars for the mainte- 
nance of a master.” (Barnard’s “Ezekiel Cheever” in Amer. Jour. of Educ., 1855.) It had then 
not only no reference to a charity school, but meant something quite different from ‘‘the com- 
monor public school as afterwards developed, particularly in Massachusetts, supported by tax 
and free of all charge to all scholars, rich and poor.” (Ibid.) The term ‘‘public school” also 
had a different meaning in those days from what prevails now. The endowed schools of Eaton 
and Harrow and Rugby, in England, were public schools, but this term was never intended to 
convey the idea that the parent patronizing it wasexempt from paying tuition. It is absolutely 
necessary, in order to a proper understanding of the schools of the early colonial days, to rec- 
ognize the exact meaning of these terms. (Dr. W. A. Mowry, at the Dorchester celebration, 
Tune 22, 1889.)

Roxbury.—Mather’s Magnalia, Book I, p. 75, ed. 1820.

and Greek. Thus gradually was developed a system upon which the later 
schools have been established, namely, ‘‘that the property of all, without distinc- 
tion, shall be applied to the education of all,”! the successful operation of which 
has undoubtedly contributed more than all other causes to bring happiness and 
prosperity to the people of New England. 
SCHOOLS IN THE MASSACHUSETTS COLONY. 
To Boston apparently belongs the honor of establishing the first school in New 
England, though there seems to be no sure evidence that it received the support 
of the town till 1641.2 It was, like all the schools of that period, a boys’ school, 
and the studies were principally the ancient languages, as the chief object in view 
was to train up a learned ministry. Besides the annual allowance of £50 to the 
master and £30 to the usher—who was to teach the children to read, write, and 
cipher—an excellent custom was introduced of attaching a house to the school, 
with a few acres of land for a garden, orchard, and for feeding a cow. This cus- 
tom became general in the early history of New England, and had a most salu- 
tary influence, as it tended to make the schoolmaster’s tenure of office permanent. 
Under the lead of the Apostle Eliot divers free schools were erected, as at Rox- 
bury, for the maintenance of which ‘‘every inhabitant bound some house or land 
for a yearly allowance forever.”* The Indian children were to have free tuition, 
the expense to be defrayed by a yearly contribution, voluntary or by rate if any 
refused, and the order was confirmed by the general court.4 Besides the income 
from some of the islands, Thomas Bell, one of the early settlers of Roxbury, left 
by will, in 1671, lands and other property for the maintenance of a ‘‘free school.” 
This property, under the able management of a board of trustees (who, by act of 
incorporation, were never to number more than 13 nor less than 9), became of 
great value. With the large income derived from it the best teachers were 
employed, so that this school early acquired a foremost position among the schools 
of New England. Cotton Mather says, ‘‘ that Roxbury has afforded more schol- 
ars, first for the college and then for the public, than any town of its bigness, or, if 
I mistake not, of twice its bigness, in all New England.” 
Of the appearance of the Roxbury schoolroom we are told that it was fitted up 
with ‘‘benches and formes for the scholars to rite” on, and that in 1652 ‘‘a desk 
to put the dictionary on” was provided. 
The grammar school’ at Cambridge, in which young men were fitted for college 
by the famous Master Corlett ‘‘seems to have been nearly coeval with the town, 
and to have been an object of great care and attention.”* The precise date when

existence in connection with the Dutch Reformed Church.

were not to “have any further benefit thereby than other strangers shall have who are not 
inhabitants.” 
4Efforts were also made by the Apostle Eliot to plant schools among the converted Indians, 
and some of their brightest lads he sent to the English schools to learn not only English, but also 
Latin and Greek.

The expression ‘‘ grammar school”? was common also in England. By it was “meant a school 
for the study of the Latin and Greek language andliterature. It wassocalled because grammatica 
(the study of language and linguistic literature) formed the leading feature of the course of all 
liberal study.” (American Jour. of Educ., 1857, p. 581.)

’ 
this school was ¢stablished is not known, but it must have been some years pre- 
vious to 1643, as Corlett had then acquired a wide reputation as a skillful and 
wise teacher. It was not made a free school until 1787, ! and even after this date 
the scholars were not wholly exempted from the payment of tuition. One-fourth 
the income derived from the Edward Hopkins Fund? was given to the master of 
the grammar school at Cambridge, the condition in the will being that he should 
instruct five boys in the studies of the school, the boys to be nominated by the 
president and fellows of Harvard College and the minister at Cambridge. This 
was apparently the first beneficiary fund in America for the education of boys. 
Among other sources of income was the rent from Thompsons Island, which, as 
early as 1639, was appropriated for the benefit of this school. There has been pre- 
served a contract, made in 1655 by President Dunster, of the college, and a certain 
Edward Goffe, with some builders of Cambrige, for a schoolhouse to be built at 
the expense, as it would seem, of the former two, or at least upon their assuming 
the responsibility. 
The school in Charlestown must have been opened at about the same time, or, 
at least, not long subsequent to the school in Boston, for in June, 1636, a certain 
Mr. Witherell ‘‘was agreed with to keep a school for a twelvemonth, to begin 
the eighth of August, and to have £40 this year.” This is evidence that a public 
school, and, judging from the agreement as to salary, a free school for at least a 
year, was thus early established, being based upon the principle of voluntary taxa- 
tion, though the whole number of inhabitants who had wives and children was 
only seventy-two.? This was eleven years before the enactment of the Massachu- 
setts law compelling towns to maintain schools. Lovells Island, which had been 
granted to the town by the general court of 1636, ‘‘provided they employ it for 
fishing,” etc., was rented, and after a short time the income therefrom was regu- 
larly applied to the support of the school. This school continued to be maintained, 
though there is no mention of a schoolhouse until 1648, when one was ordered to 
be built on ‘‘ Windmill Hill” and paid for by a ‘‘ general rate.” Oldmixon in his 
~ history calls Charlestown the mother of Boston. 
We have no account of any school in Salem until after the arrival of the Rev. 
John Fiske in 1637, who, distinguished alike for wealth and learning, continued 
to teach until January, 1640. Among the pupils he prepared for Harvard College 
was the afterwards famous Sir George Downing, who was in high favor both with 
Cromwell and Charles II. In March, 1641, a town meeting was called to see about 
establishing ‘‘a free school,” and this, according to the historian of Salem,’ was 
‘the first written intimation that we have of instruction without price’ among our 
1 Paige’s History of Cambridge, p. 379. 
2 Edward Hopkins, who had been governor of the Connecticut colony, dying in 1657, bequeathed 
a large sum for the furtherance of education in the colonies of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and 
New Haven. (Seo again under ‘ Education in Connecticut.) 
3 Frothingham’s History of Charlestown, p. 77. Dr. Mowry (in the address already referred 
to) takes tho ground that the agreement with Mr. Witherell is not conclusive evidence that the 
school was opened in that year. He says that ‘“‘so far as Iknow there is no evidence that the 
town supported the school by taxation till long after 1640,” 
4Felt’s Annals of Salem, Vol. I, p. 426. 
5In the History of Dorchester, published in 1859 by the Dorchester Antiquarian and Histor- 
ical Society, it is claimed (p. 420) that the first public provision ‘for a free school in the world 
by a direct tax or assessment on the inhabitants” was made in that town on the 30th of May, 
1639. 
‘On the 4th of March, 1635, the general court of the Massachusetts colony granted to the inhab- 
itants of the town of Dorchester Thompson's Island ‘to enjoy to them, their heirs and succes- 
sors wh shall inhabite there forever,’ on condition that they pay to the treasury 12d. yearly 
asrent. In May, 1639, at the date above named, the town voted to lay a tax on the proprietors 
of said island for ‘the maintenance of a school in Dorchester.’ The writer of the History of 
Dorchester has the following explanation of the word ‘proprietors:’ ‘It is supposed that under 
the term ‘proprietors,’ in this connection, was included the principal part of the adult male 
inhabitants of the town.’ This explanation is further confirmed by the wording of a subse-

      FIRST COMMON SCHOOLS OF NEW ENGLAND. 1171 
  settlers.” For more than a hundred years from its establishment this school was 
presided over by graduates of Harvard College. In 1677 the income from Bakers 
Island, the two Misery Islands, and from the Beverly Ferry was applied toward 
the support of a grammar school in Salem, and in the years 1680 and 1682 we find 
it recorded that the master was allowed a salary of £15. In 1699 the children who 
attended the grammar school, then numbering only twenty, were required to pay 
each an annual tuition of 12 shillings. Soon after this a writing school was pro- 
yided, and a few years later a master was employed to teach mathematics. Dur- 
ing the first half of the eighteenth century many donations were made to the 
grammar and writing schools, and one of ‘£60 to a woman’s school.” Not the 
least among the innovations of the time was a bell which in 1723 was sent from 
England. In connection with the story of this bell we learn the length of the 
school day, for it is said that the bell rang at 7 in the morning and 5 in the after- 
noon from March to November, and at 8 and 4 from November to March, “the 
school to begin and end accordingly; ” and the afternoon session was ordered to. 
begin “at 1 o’clock all the yearround.” Itis worthy of notice that the school com- 
mittee was not chosen as a board separate from the selectmen until 1753, In the 
history of Salem we find an illustration of the difference of meaning in the expres- 
sion ‘‘free school” as applied to the earlier and later schools. The earlier idea is 
expressed by an order of 1644, that such as have children to be kept at school, 
“bring in their names and what they will give for one whole year, and also that 
if any poor body hath children or a child to be put to school and not able to pay 
for their schooling that the town will pay it by a rate;” and the later one by the 
enactment of 1768,' that the teachers be ‘‘ entirely paid by a town tax where no 
funds existed, and not as before, partly by a tax and partly by the pupils.” 
The town of Newbury, in 1639, granted 10 acres of land to Anthony Somerby 
“for his encouragement to keep school one year;” but the first notice of the town’s 
intention to build a schoolhouse and support a teacher at their expense was in 
1652. In 1653 it was ordered “ that the town should pay £24 by the year to main- 
tain a free school at’ the meetinghouse,” against which vote seventeen persons 
“desired to have their dissents recorded.” 
Duxbury established a school in 1655. 
In the records of Ipswich we find, under date of 1636, this item: “A grammar 
school is set up but does not succeed.” Some years later the historian Hubbard, » 
who was pastor of the church at Ipswich, founded and endowed the first public 
school, but its period of prosperity did not begin until 1650, when he introduced 
as its master the patriarch of New England teachers, Ezekiel Cheever. In 1651 
a grant of land was made by the town to the school, and in the January following 
quent vote concerning this rental: ‘Whereas the inhabitants of Dorchester have formally 
ordered, Consented and agreed that a Rente of Twentie pounds pr ann. shall issue & be payd by 
the sayd Inhabitants & their heires from & outof a Certaine porcon of land in Dorchester called. 
Thomson's Hand for & towards the maintenance of the schoole in Dorchester aforesayd,’ ete. It 
appears certain from this wording that this tax upon Thompson's Island was in reality a town tax 
or a tax upon the town. The probability would seem to be that when the island was made over 
by the general court to the town of Dorchester the land was apportioned among the principal 
inhabitants, or ‘freemen’, of the town resident upon the mainland. At allevents, this wasa tax 
levied by the town as a direct provision for the school.” (Address by William A. Mowry, Ph. D., 
at the Dorchester celebration.) 
But the newly created proprietors did not evidently relish the imposed tax, and they there- 
fore soon after made a conveyance of the island to the town for the special support and estab- 
lishment of a free school. 
Francis Adams, in The Free School System of the United States, p. 46, says that Hartford, 
Conn., appears to be the first town which established a free school, but there can be little doubt 
that Massachusetts was the first State to make laws providing for a regular system of free 
schools. * 
1 Previous to 1768 the laws of Massachusetts required that schools should be sustained by the 
inhabitants, but they were left free as to the manner in which tuition should be paid.

a committee was chosen ‘to receive all such sums of money as have and shall be 
given toward the building and maintaining of a grammar school and school- 
master, and to disburse and dispose such sums as are given to provide a school- 
house and schoolmaster’s house,” etc. They were also to receive such sums of 
money, parcels of land, rents, or annunities as are or shall be given toward the 
maintenance of a schoolmaster, and to regulate all matters pertaining to the 
master and the scholars. In the following years grants of land were made either 
by private citizens or by the town at a general town meeting, with the stipulation 
that the income from it should be devoted to the support of the school. The 
towns we have thus named were among the first in the Massachusetts colony to 
establish prosperous ‘‘free schools.” Many others were also active in the estab- 
lishment of schools, and are therefore deserving of equal recognition for their 
services in the cause of education during the seventeenth century. ! 
NOTE.? 
  An important fact connected with the history of the school at Dorchester was 
the appointment of a special school committee, whose members were charged with 
the entire oversight of the school. This committee, consisting of three men, who 
were termed ‘‘ wardens or overseers of the schoole,” was established at the ‘‘ March 
meeting” in 1645, and is believed to have been ‘the first school committee 
appointed by any municipality in this country.” The article required that they 
should be residents of Dorchester and hold their office for life, though the town 
reserved the right to displace any one of them for ‘‘ weighty reasons.” 
“ Here was the beginning of the public management of schools by the municipal- 
ity, and here is the essential beginning of the American public-school system,” which 
“ig unquestionably the most distinctively American institution which this coun- 
try has produced.” ‘‘ Here the example was set, which is to-day followed by all 
America, of the local citizens, qualified by law to vote in local affairs, selecting 
men to have the control and ordering of all matters pertaining to the local public 
schools. We have now all over this country a system of public schools, estab- 
lished and controlled by law and under the management of school committees or 
directors of the local towns or cities, city school boards, or county school boards, 
or officers of equivalent power, whatever their local appellation may be.” At the 
outset our system of schools had a gradual growth, and itis yet but a few years 
since this great system became absolutely free. To this we have added in Mas- 
sachusetts ‘‘a compulsory law to oblige all the children to attend either these or 
other schools.” 
‘« Till the free text-book law went into effect, in 1885, there had always been 
something for the parent to pay. At first there was a ‘rate bill;’ then the teacher 
‘boarded round;’ the wood was sometimes contributed by the parents sending 
the children, and in proportion to the number of children sent. Even after these 
customs were abolished, and all these things were paid for out of the public 
money, it still remained that the books were furnished only at the expense of the 
parent. Now, however, the schools of the Old Bay State are absolutely free, and 
she was the first of all the States to make them so.” 
At the time of creating the school “ wardens” the inhabitants of Dorchester at 
their March meeting established ‘‘rules and orders concerning the school.” These 
were for the guidance of the wardens, and among them may be found the follow- 
ing, which would not wholly meet with public favor to-day: 
  
+ In August, 1640, Newport, R. I., voted “that 100 acres should be laid forth and appropriated * 
for the establishment of a “ public school.” As appears from subsequent entries in the town 
records this was a “Latin school” or “grammar school,” in the English sense of the term. 
2'The following facts and excerpts are taken from Dr. Mowry’s address at the Dorchester 
celebration, June 22, 1889.

ination any of the Elde™ or othe" Inhabitants that please may bee present, to 
behold his religious care herein, and to giue there Countenance and approbation 
of the same,” 
The fifth article very emphatically hints at that democratic principle which tol- 
erated no caste, or class, or social distinction which should abridge the legal and 
political rights of any. It provided that the schoolmaster should receive “equally 
and impartially such as shall be presented and committed to him for that end, 
whether theer parents bee poore or rich, not refusing any who have right or inter- 
est in the schoole.” 
The sixth is also an article of interest to us at this day: 
“Such as shall be Committed to him he shall diligently instruct, as they shalbe 
able to learne, both in humane learning and good litterature, & likewyse in poynt 
of good manne" and dutifull behauviou™ towards all, specially there supio™ as they 
shall haue occasion to bee in ther® presence, whithe" by meeting them in the streete 
or otherwyse.” 
Among the ‘‘rules and orders” then put in operation is one requiring the war- 
dens ‘‘from tyme to tyme to see that the schoole house be kept in good and suffi- 
cient repaire,” and if necessary to ‘‘repayre to the 7 men of the towne for the tyme 
being, who shall have power to tax the towne with such some or sommes as shall 
be requested for the repayering of the schoole house as aforesayed.” 
Another provision was “that every year at or before the end of the 9th ‘month 
there bee brought to the schoole house 12 sufficient cart or wayne loads of wood 
for fewell * * * the cost and charge of which sayd wood to bee borne by the 
schollers for the tyme being who shalbe taxed for the purpose at the discretion of 
the sayd wardens.” 
The placing of the public school in the hands of three prominent citizens was 
certainly a wise provision, and proved in the years to come a most helpful aid to 
the development of our free-school system. It had in mind simply the proper nur- 
turing of their own children, but it resulted in laying the foundations ‘on which 
future ages should build a temple at once large and grand and beautiful, for here 
was established the principle of representation.” Horace Mann says: ‘‘As an inno- 
vation upon all preexisting policy and usages, the establishment of free schools 
was the boldest ever promulgated since the commencement of the Christian era. 
As a theory it could have been refuted and silenced by a more formidable array of 
arguments and experience than was ever marshaled against any other opinion of 
human origin. But time has ratified its soundness. Two centuries now proclaim 
it to be as wise as it was courageous, as beneficent as it was disinterested. It 
was one of those grand mental and moral experiments whose effect can not be 
determined in a single generation. But now, according to the manner in which 
human life is computed, we are the sixth generation from its founders; and have 
we not reason to be grateful, both to God and man, for its numberless blessings? 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  1174 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
The sincerity of our gratitude must be tested by our efforts to perpetuate and 
improve what they established. The gratitude of lips only is an unholy offering.”! 
The three following propositions described the broad and everenduring founda- 
tion on which the common-school system of Massachusetts reposes: 
The successive generations of men, taken collectively, constitute one great Com- 
monwealth., 
The property of this Commonwealth is pledged for the education of allits youth 
up to such a point as will save them from poverty and vice, and prepare them for 
the adequate performance of their social and civil duties. 
The successive holders of this property are trustees, bound to the faithful execu- 
tion of their trust by the most sacred obligations; because embezzlement and pil- 
lage from children and descendants are as criminal as the same offenses when 
perpetrated against contemporaries. 
Recognizing these eternal principles of national ethics, the constitution of Mas- 
sachusetts—the fundamental law of the State—after declaring (among other 
things), in the preamble to the first section of the fifth chapter, that ‘‘ the encour- 
agement of arts and sciences and all good literature tends to the honor of God, 
the advantage of the Christian religion, and the great benefitof this and the other 
United States of America,” proceeds in the second section of the same chapter to 
set forth the duties of all future legislatures and magistrates, in the following noble 
and impressive language: 
“* Wisdom and knowledge, as well as virtue, diffused generally among the body 
of the people, being necessary for the preservation of their rights and liberties, and 
as these depend on spreading the opportunities and advantages of education in the 
various parts of the country, and among the different orders of the people, itshall 
be the duty of legislators and magistrates, in all future periods of this Common- 
wealth, to cherish the interests of literature and the sciences, and all seminaries of 
them, especially the University of Cambridge, public schools, and grammar schools 
in the towns; to encourage private societies and public institutions, rewards and 
immunities, for the promotion of agriculture, arts, sciences, commerce, trades, 
manufactures, anda natural history of the country; to countenance and inculcate 
the principles of humanity and general benevolence, public and private charity, 
industry and frugality, honesty and punctuality in their dealings; sincerity, good 
humor, and all social affections and generous sentiments among the people.” 
EDUCATION IN PLYMOUTH COLONY. 
As the first settlers in New England, the people of Plymouth deserve special 
mention, though their struggles in reclaiming the wilderness, their sufferings 
from the Indians, their losses by disease and other causes prevented them for many 
years from making any public provision for the education of their children. In 
the records of Plymouth colony the first notice with reference to schools occurs 
under ‘‘court proceedings” of the year 1663, as follows: ‘‘It is proposed by the 
court unto the several townships in this jurisdiction, as a thing that they ought to 
take into their serious consideration, that some course may be taken, that in 
every town there may be a schoolmaster set up to train up children to reading and 
writing.” It would be fair, then, to assume that previous to this date there were 
no public schools in the colony, though as many as twelve towns had already been 
incorporated. A generation and more had, therefore, grown up without the 
advantages of public schools, though instruction was evidently given at home, in 
private schools, and by the parish minister.‘ In 1667 it was enacted that in every

town of fifty families £12 be raised by tax for the support of grammar schools. 
But this act, as well as that of 1663, seems to have been disregarded, for no defi- 
nite action was taken to establish schools until public support was promised to 
them. Accordingly, in 1670, the “ general court of his majesty, holden at New 
Plymouth, did freely give and grant” such profits as might annually accrue to the 
colony from fishing at Cape Cod, etc., ‘‘to be improved for and toward a free 
school in some town of this jurisdiction for the training up of youth in literature 
for the good and benefit of posterity.”! In addition to this grant by the general 
court, the town of Plymouth, in 1672, voted to give the profits that might arise 
from the improvement of a certain tract of land toward the maintenance of a 
school. About this time a schoolhouse was built by subscription, several of the © 
citizens of Plymouth, ‘out of their good affection,” giving ‘‘of their own estate” 
for this purpose. In 1671, the building having been finished, the first public 
teacher of Plymouth, ‘‘Mr. John Morton,” opened the school. His duties were 
stated to be: To teach the children and youth to read the Bible, to write, and to 
cast accounts. But it would seem that the school was not permanently main- 
tained, for Mr. Josiah Cotton, who was born there in 1679 and began to teach the 
Plymouth school in 1698, says, ‘‘I do not recollect that I ever went to any town 
school.” 
The giving of public lands in perpetuity, the income of which should be devoted 
to the schools, was inaugurated at the very beginning of the free schools of 
Plymouth, and resulted most favorably for the cause of education. In 1705 sun- 
dry inhabitants bound themselves to pay £20 annually for seven years, with the 
understanding that all children that did not belong to the subscribers of the fund 
should pay a certain rate per week, and that the rate of those living more than a 
mile away should be only half that required of those living nearer. Thus it will 
be seen that in Plymouth colony, as in the Massachusetts, care was taken that the 
benefits of education should be enjoyed by all.2 Barry, in his History of Massa- 
chusetts, says that ‘‘instances of neglect were exceedingly rare. Poverty pre- 
vented many from giving their children the highest advantages, but compara- 
tively few could be found whose instruction had been wholly overlooked. er 
A preparation for the duties of practical life was sought by the most; the ambition 
of some soared higher.”’* 
EDUCATION IN CONNECTICUT.+4 
  The colonies of Connecticut and New Haven zealously emulated those of Massa- 
chusetts and Plymouth in their liberal policy in the establishment of free schools, 
So deep was the interest taken that, even before there was any legislative action, 
the ministers and magistrates were found pleading for an allowance out of the 
common treasury for the support of public schools, and entreating parents of all 
classes to send their children tothem. Foremost among these early promoters of 
learning were the Rey. Mr. Davenport and Governor Eaton, both of the New 
Haven colony, whose plan contemplated: First, common town schools where all 
their sons might ‘‘learn to read and write and cast up accounts and make some 
entrance into the Latin tongue;” second, a common or colony school with a school- 
master qualified to teach Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, ‘‘so far as shall be neces- 
sary” to prepare the youth for college; third, a town or county library; fourth, a 
college for the colony ‘‘for the education of the youth in good literature to fit 
them for public service in church and commonwealth.”® The effect of such an 
enlightened policy was most fortunate, laying, as it did thus early, the founda-

tion for the great prosperity which has since followed. Besides adopting largely 
the school laws of Massachusetts, it was thought best ‘‘ that grammar school- 
masters should be approved by the selectmen of the town and the minister of the 
same or a neighboring town.” 
The first school in the New Haven colony of which we have any record was 
opened in New Haven in 1639, and here Ezekiel Cheever, at the age of 25, began 
his long career as a teacher. It was not at first a free school, for the general 
court held at New Havenin the early part of 1641 ‘‘ordered that a free school be 
set up in this town.” For its maintenance the pastor and magistrates were to 
consider ‘‘ what yearly allowance is meet to be given to it out of the common 
stock of the town,” and also what rules should be observed ‘‘in and about the 
same.” The early records of New Haven are full of entries referring to moneys 
appropriated to teachers and to reports of committees on the subject of schools. 
These committees always included among their number the governor, minister, 
and magistratessor deputies. In 1642, seven years after the first house was built, 
a school was established in Hartford, in the Connecticut colony, and an appropria- 
tion of £30 was settled upon it. The master was to receive a salary of £16 a year, 
and those parents or guardians who were willing to send their children to school 
and could bear the expense should pay “20 shillings the year;” others should have 
their children instructed ‘‘at the town’s charge.” 
In general in both colonies the mode of supporting the schools was made partly 
a charge on the general funds or property of the town and partly a rate bill or 
tuition, paid by the parents or guardians of the children attending school, ‘‘ paying 
alike to the head.” But this did not apply to the poor, who were sent free of 
charge. The tax for this purpose was levied in every town with the annual State 
tax and payable proportionately only to those towns which should establish 
schools according to law. Trumbull says! that for the permanent support of the 
schools ‘‘large tracts of land were given and appropriated by the legislature.”* 
The public school was one of the earliest subjects of municipal legislation, as 
much, for example, as the roads and bridges, the support of public worship, and 
protection against the Indians, these four being the principal objects of care and 
attention. The code of 1650, the first that was drawn up by the Connecticut 
colony, provided for the ‘‘ family instruction of children and the maintenance of 
schools by tewns,” and was the same as that of Massachusetts. It remained on 
the statute books, with only slight modifications, for more than a century anda 
half. The school system embraced every family and town, all classes of children 
and youth, and all the then recognized grades of schools. In this way the State 
laid the basis ‘‘ not only for universal education, but for a practical and social 
equality which has never been surpassed in the history of any other community.’ 
Governor Eaton in 1655 drew up a code of laws for the government of the New 
Haven colony, then numbering six plantations, in which he laid special stress 
upon the duty of parents and masters to educate their children and apprentices, 
and imposed fines in case of neglect. He also ordered, as in the Connecticut code 
of 1650, that as a last resort children and apprentices should be placed with others 
“‘who shall better educate and govern them,” both for their own and the public 
good.

2 At a later date (in 1795, but not incorporated into the State constitution until 1818) the legis- 
lature of Connecticut established a permanent irreducible fund, the income of which shall be 
applied to the support of common or public schools. This fund was obtained by the sale of lands 
in New Connecticut, or the so-called Western Reserve in the northeastern part of Ohio, and the 
‘income from it, as stated in the North American Review for April, 1823, amounted in 1822 to 
more than $60,000. This was apportioned among the school districts according to the number of 
pupils in each. See Letters on the Free Schools of New England, pp. 20, 21, by J. G. Carter.

FIRST COMMON SCHOOLS OF NEW ENGLAND. 1177 
Very early in the history of the Connecticut colonies an appeal came from Har- 
vard College to all the people to contribute toward the maintenance of poor 
scholars at the college. In response to this the general court of the New Haven 
colony ‘‘ordered that two men shall be appointed in every town within this juris- 
diction who shall demand what every family will give, and the same to be gathered 
and brought into some room in March; and this to continue yearly,! as it shall be 
considered by the commissioners.” It was determined that about a ‘‘peck of 
wheat,” or the value of it, 12 pence, should be contributed by every family that 
was willing, and in 1644 one of the commissioners ‘‘reported that he had sent 40 
bushels of wheat, the gift of New Haven to the college” at Cambridge. Soon after, 
that is, as early as 1647, they were seriously considering the expediency of having 
a college of their own, to “be set up as soon as their ability will reach thereunto.” 
But at a general court, held at Guilford June 28, 1652, it was voted that ‘‘the 
matter about a college at New Haven was thought to be too great a charge for us 
of this jurisdiction to undergo alone.”? 
The earliest legislation in Connecticut respecting the education of the Indians 
is found in the code of 1650, wherein the court orders that the teaching elders 
shall go among the Indians and endeavor to give them religious instruction. 
Schools were also established among them, the most successful one being at 
Farmington. This was taught from 1648 to 1697 by the minister of the parish, 
and as late as 1736 notices of this school are found in the colonial records, which 
show that it was still in existence. Some very promising boys were educated at 
this school, and among them one Samson Occum, who afterwards became quite 
famous. 
In 1665 the colony of New Haven formed the union with the Connecticut under 
the charter of Charles II. In 1671 county gramimar schools were established and 
the former town grammar schools discontinued. These new schools were accord- 
ingly located at Hartford, New Haven, New London, and Fairfield, there being 
at the time but four counties in Connecticut, To aid in endowing these schools 
the general court appropriated 600 acres of land to each of the four county towns 
forever, the same to be improved in the best manner and the income applied for 
the benefit of the grammar schools. Of these schools two, namely, those of Hart- 
ford and New Haven, the court decreed should be of a higher grade and also free. 
They were to teach ‘‘reading (but pupils before entering must be able to read 
distinctly the psalter), writing, arithmetic, the Latin and English languages,” 
and were to have ‘‘the more extensive and special enjoyment” of the income 
derived from the legacy left by Governor Hopkins.*? From that time they— 
mostly as free and always as public schools—have provided facilities for prepar- 
ing young men for college. The one at New Haven, called the Hopkins Grammar 
School, has, however, kept the more nearly up to the high ideal of its early patrons. 
The Hartford school, having in time lost its character of a public grammar or 
Latin school, became ‘the main reliance of the town for the education of all its 
children,” and so continued until 1798, when the general assembly restored it to a 
grammar school, in accordance with ‘‘the original intent of the donor.” The

2 Quoted in President Dwight’s Travels in New England, p. 200. 
8 The will of Mr. Hopkins was made in 1657, shortly before his death. In 1664 the two sur- 
viving trustees signed an instrument allotting £400 to Hartford for the support of a grammar 
school and appointing that the rest of the estate “ be all of it equally divided between the towns 
of New Haven and Hadley, to be managed and improved for the erecting and maintaining a 
school in each of the said towns.” President Dwight, in Travels in New England, p. 206, says, 
in regard to the distribution of this legacy, that about £2,000 intended by Hopkins for Yale 
College ‘‘ fell through a series of accidents partly into the hands of her sister seminary [H. C.] 
and partly into the hands of trustees of three grammar schools—one at New Haven, one at 
Hartford, and one at Hadley, in Massachusetts.”
-P-A-G-E-50
1178 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
grammar school established at Hadley by the allotment from the Hopkins fund 
was assisted by donations from individuals or the town, and has ever since been 
continued either under the name of grammar school or academy. Soon after the 
union of the colonies other public schools were ‘‘set up” and efficiently supported, 
as also a few private schools to fit young men for college or carry them forward 
in the higher branches of an English education. 
From the testimony of men who were educated in the common schools prior to 
1800, it appears that the course of instruction was limited to spelling, reading, 
writing, and the elements of arithmetic. These studies, however, were attended 
to by all the children, so that it was rare to find a native of Connecticut ‘who 
could not read the holy word of God and the good laws of the State.”! The 
supervision of the schools was shared alike by the selectmen, who considered it a 
part of their town office, and by the clergy, who had come to look upon it ‘‘as a 
regular part of their parochial duty.” 
By such men and measures were common schools established in all the New 
England colonies, thus gradually forming a system of public education such as 
at that time had no ‘‘parallel in any part of the world.” 
EARLY LEGISLATION WITH REFERENCE TO SCHOOLS. 
  Lord Macaulay says* of the Puritans that they believed ‘the State should take 
upon itself the charge of the education of the people;” and another * declares, ‘‘It 
has always been acharacteristic of New England that she adopted and maintained 
the principle that it is the right and duty of government to provide for the sup- 
port of free schools; that every man should be taxed therefor, whether he have 
children or not.” The first legislative act with reference to schools was passed by 
the general court of the Massachusetts colony in 1642, and enjoined the universal 
education of children, but it neither made the schools free nor attached any pen- 
alty for neglecting to establish them. November 11, 1647, another act was passed 
making the support of the schools compulsory. In this act, then, we have the 
origin of the free schools of New England. It reads as follows: ‘‘It is therefore 
ordered that every township in this jurisdiction, after the Lord hath increased 
them to 50 householders, shall then forthwith appoint one within their town to 
teach all such children as shall resort to him to write and read, whose wages shall 
be paid either by the parents or masters of such children, or by the inhabitants 
in general by way of supply, as the major part of those that order the prudentials 
of the town shall appoint, provided those that send their children be not oppressed 
by paying much more than they can have them taught for in other towns.”? It 
was further ordered that, when any town increased to the number of a hundred 
families or householders, a grammar school should be established, and a master 
employed who could ‘‘instruct the youth so far as they may be fitted for the uni- 
versity;”° ‘‘if any town neglect the performance hereof above one year, that every 
such town shall pay £5 to the next school till they shall perform this order.”+ In 
1683 the court ordered ‘‘that whenever a town has 500 families it shall support 
two grammar schools and two writing schools.” By the law of 1642 parents and 
masters were to look to the profitable employment of their children, and it was 
made a ‘‘ barbarism” not to teach or have others teach their children or appren- 
tices not only reading, but also a knowledge of the laws, and a penalty of 20 
shillings was attached for the neglect to do so.® 
1Mr. Barnard says (American Journal of Education, 1855, p. 302) that ‘‘Connecticut solved 
the problem of universal education, so that in 1800 neither a family nor an individual could be 
met with who was not sufficiently instructed to read the English tongue.”

FIRST COMMON SCHOOLS OF NEW. ENGLAND. 1179 
In the Connecticut code of 1650 the provision for the care and instruction of 
children was, as already stated, like that of Massachusetts. In this it was made 
the duty of selectmen to watch over the children and apprentices and see that they 
were taught to read and also well instructed in the capital laws of the colony. 
For every neglect therein a fine of 20 shillings was laid, and masters of families 
were required to ‘“‘catechise their children and servants in the grounds and prin- 
ciples of religion,” and also bring them up to “honest, lawful calling, labor, or 
employment.” In case of failure to comply with the law in any of these particu- 
lars, the selectmen, with the help of the magistrates, were required to take such 
children away and place them with masters who should agree to instruct them in 
conformity with the law. 
In 1677 it was ordered that ‘‘if any county town shall neglect to keep a Latin 
school according to order,' there shall be paid a fine of £10 by the said county 
towns to the next town in that county that will engage and keep a Latin school in 
it,” and this fine was to be paid annually until they should comply with the law.? 
In 1701, after a full revision of the school laws of Connecticut, we have the 
following legal provisions for the education of children:? 
First. An cbligation on the part of every parent and guardian to teach children 
to read, and, besides, ‘‘bring them up tosome lawful calling or employment,” 
under a penalty for each offense. 
Second. A tax of 40 shillings on every £1,000 on the lists of estates, to be col- 
lected in every town with the annual State.tax and payable proportionately only 
to those towns which should keep their schools according to law. If, however, 
this levy proved insufficient to maintain a suitable schoolmaster, the inhabitants 
were to pay half and the parents or masters of the children the other half, ‘‘ unless 
any town agree otherwise.” 
Third. A common school in every town having over 704 families to be kept for 
eleven months of the year, and in towns of less than 70 families to be kept for at 
least half the year. 
Fourth. A grammar school in each of the four head county towns to fit youth 
for college, two of which grammar schools must be free. 
Fifth. A collegiate school, toward which the general court shall make an annual 
appropriation of £120. 
Sixth. ‘‘ Provision for the religious instruction of the Indians.” 
We see, then, that in the early legislation, more especially of the New Haven, 
Connecticut, and Massachusetts colonies, provision was made for the ‘‘ honorable 
employment” of children as well as for their intellectual training. This was a 
most wise provision, and had it continued in force, the criminal and pauper record 
of New England would have been radically different from what it is to-day. If 
we look closely into these laws, and especially into the provisions for the protection . 
of children and apprentices from the cupidity of parents and masters, we shall 
doubtless see the first manifestation of that republican sentiment which after- 
wards spread through the land and proclaimed it free. 
THE EARLY SCHOOLMASTERS. 
We can scarcely place too high an estimate upon the service rendered to New 
England by her early teachers. Among these we must include many of her best 
educated clergymen who, in towns where there were no free or grammar schools, 
“fitted young men of piety and talent for college and for higher usefulness in

schools for every town having 100 families.

4 Originally 50families, but in 1678 a law had been passed that every town of 30 families should 
maintain a school and teach the children to read and write.

church and state.”! They were chiefly instrumental in keeping alive ‘‘ the fires 
of classical learning brought here from the public schools and universiries of 
England.” Even with all their sympathy and help and the faithful labors of the 
pioneer teachers, the second, third, and fourth generations of the New England 
colonists, where schools were not specially encouraged, ‘‘ seemed destined to fall 
into barbarism.”* 
Among the most noted of these early schoolmasters were Ezekiel Cheever and 
Elijah Corlett,’? of whom Cotton Mather wrote: 
‘Tis Corlett’s pains and Cheever’s we must own, 
That thou, New England, art not Scythia grown.” 
Master Corlett died February 25, 1686-7, at the age of 78, after having been for 
nearly half acentury a notable figureinCambridge. He was, to quote Dr. Mather 
again, ‘‘that memorable old ‘schoolmaster in Cambridge from whose education 
our college and country have received so many of its worthy men that he is him- 
self worthy to have his namecelebrated * * * inour church history.”* Still, 
though he was able to teach both the English and Indian children, his school 
seems never to have been large—numbering in 1680 but nine pupils—nor were the 
fees he received for tuition at all adequate to his support. To enable him to gain 
a bare subsistence occasional special grants were made by the town and colony, 
and an annual appropriation of about £7 10s. from the Hopkins charity fund. For 
a century or more following his time, his successers at Cambridge fared, it is 
said, but little better. 
Ezekiel Cheever gained a much wider and more enduring reputation. Born in 
England in 1614 and landing at Boston in 1637, he was for the long period of 
seventy years schoolmaster without an equal at New Haven, Ipswich, Charlestown, 
and Boston. He is described as ‘‘a scholar, learned, accurate, judicious, a severe 
and unsparing master, tall, dignified, and stern.”® Dr. Mather says of him, ‘‘ we 
generally concur in acknowledging that New England has never known a better 
teacher. Iam sure I have as much reason to appear for him.as ever Crito for his 
master Socrates.”® The early excellence of the Latin school at Boston, over which 
he presided for thirty-eight years, was due to his care. He was evidently a master 
whom the pupils ‘‘delighted to honor,” for he is spoken of by them with great 
affection, though one of them, the Rev. John Barnard,’ of Marblehead, tells us 
that he did not spare the rod, and cites his own experience, how, on one occasion, 
the old master said to him, ‘‘ You, Barnard, I know that you can do well enough 
if you will; but you are-so full of play that you hinder your classmates from get- 
ting their lessons, and, therefore, if any of them can not perform their duty I shall 
correct you for it.” One of his classmates, he adds, taking advantage of this, con- 
tinued for some days to fail in his recitations, until he, Barnard, concluded that 
there was no way to escape from his daily punishment except by flogging his tor- 
mentor. 
Mr. Cheever was the author of the Accidence, ‘‘A short introduction to the 
Latin tongue,” which passed through more than twenty editions, and continued 
for over a century and a half the text-book of most of the Latin scholars of New

early day—one noteworthy fact being that in his’ sixth year the schoolmistress made him an 
usher or monitor, and appointed him to teach children both older and younger than himself. 
This was more than a hundred years before Bell or Lancaster introduced their newly discovered 
monitorial system.

England. Dr. Samuel Bentley, of Salem, an antiquarian and collector of school- 
books, says of this Accidence, that it was “the wonder of the age.” Eminent 
teachers during the present century, and among them President Quincy, of Har- 
vard College, have highly commended Cheever’s Accidence, and expressed the 
hope that it might be restored to its former place in the schools. ‘Besides several 
Latin dissertations and poems, he was also the author of a small treatise upon 
“Scripture prophecies explained,” in three short essays. This patriarch of New 
England schoolmasters continued his work with almost youthful vigor up to the 
time of his death, which occurred in Boston in August, 1708.! 
From the very first, the founders of the young commonwealth thought it neces- 
sary to guard most jealously against the employment of unworthy teachers. In 
the records of the court, May 3, 1654, we find that it was made the special care of 
the officers of Harvard College and the selectmen of the several towns not to suffer 
any to instruct the youth or children who ‘‘have manifested themselves unsound 
in the faith or scandalous in their lives.” 
Much in every way was expected of the grammar-school teachers, and the can- 
didate for this office must be a man of cultivation and refinement, which, as it 
was then supposed, could only be obtained by an acquaintance with the learned 
languages. The schoolmaster was an important personage in the eyes of the 
community, being treated with the respect that was accorded to the minister and 
magistrates. As an illustration of this, it is recorded that ‘‘his wife was to be 
accommodated with a pew next the wives of the magistrates.”? 
In the eighteenth century there seems to have been a lack of teachers who were 
capable of fitting young men for college, and thus the necessity arose of establish- 
ing what were afterwards called academies. Governor Dummer, who died in 
1761, having founded a flourishing academy at Byfield, Mass., was the pioneer 
in this enterprise. His example stimulated the Phillipses—uncle and nephew— 
to found the two noble academies at Andover and Exeter, which still bear their 
names, 
SCHOOLBOOKS. 
In those early days there were no spelling books nor English grammars. The 
letters were learned from the Bible, and this book and the Testament and Psalter 
were the only reading books. The catechism, as in the parochial schools of the 
present time, which they resembled, received great attention. _Besides this, read- 
ing, writing, and arithmetic were the chief, if not the only branches taught. . For 
a century still there were no printed copy books and no slates in use, the ciphering 
and writing being done on paper. In 1691 there appears in the Boston Almanac 
an interesting notice of the New England Primer, the second edition being then 
in press. This new and enlarged edition had fuller directions for spelling, also 
the Prayer of Edward VI, and the verses said to have been written by the mar- 
tyred John Rogers. This primer contained the catechism of John Cotton, printed 
in 1656, and also that of the Westminster Assembly. It probably resembled the 
primer of Great Britain which existed before the Puritans came to America, 
Locke, the philosopher, mentions a book of this name, and in 1759 one called the 
Royal Primer was commonin New England. This, or one similar to it, continued 
in use until about the beginning of the present century.’ 
There was a little book called the ‘‘Horn-book” (named from the horn covers), 
which seems to have been of simpler plan than the Primer, and of which Shakes- 
peare speaks as “‘ the teacher of boys” inhis day. It wasso used also in Massachu- 
setts at the first, and even up to a century ago, and out of its supposed indispensa-

bleness grew the expression, ‘‘He does not know his horn-book,” which we have 
since changed to ‘‘ He doesn’t know his letters.” Another important book was 
The English Schoole Master, the fifteenth edition of which was printed in Lon- 
don in 1624. ‘Its main object,” as stated in the preface, ‘‘was to teach correct 
reading.” The’New England Psalter! was used in a similar way. 
Among the earliest arithmetics was that of James Hodder, which in 1719 reached 
its twenty-eighth London edition. The most popular of the early geographies 
appear to have been Meriton’s, which was printed in London in 1679, and Laurence 
Eachard’s, of nearly the same date. Of the dictionaries used in New England, 
Coles’s, published in London in 1692, and Bollocker’s, the ninth edition of which 
was printed in 1695, were, at the close of the seventeenth century, the standards, 
In Latin, before the publication of Cheever’s Accidence, Brinsley’s, first issued in 
1611-12, wasiin use; also another printed in London in 1639, called Directions for 
Young Latinists. A still later one was Hoole’s Accidence, published in 1681. In 
Greek there was the Westminster Grammar of 1671, and in Hebrew the grammar 
of Schickard, issued in 1623, and Buxtorf’s, which was printed before 1629.° 
The books we have named give some idea of the studies pursued in the common, 
‘grammar, and private schools of New England during the seventeenth and early 
part of the eighteenth century, or during the first century of colonial life. The 
choice of books appears to have been made as ‘‘convenience and preference dic- 
tated.” With the exception of those for reading, spelling,’ and ciphering, none of 
the earlier ones was retained as late as 1815, 
During the eighteenth century schoolbooks of all kinds multiplied rapidly. 
These included works upon arithmetic, bookkeeping, navigation, geography, Eng- 
lish and Latin grammars and dictionaries, Greek grammars and lexicons, books 
upon belles-lettres, and many others which are named in Felts Annals of Salem, 
and in Barnard’s Catalogue of American Text-books. 
In reviewing the history of this early period one becomes more and more 
impressed with a sense of the obligation we are under to the Puritans and Pilgrim 
Fathers for the interest they took in education. Unfortunately their descendants 
of the third and fourth generations did not follow their example. So greatly did 
the interest in education decline that during a large part of the eighteenth cen- 
tury prior to the Revolutionary war it is said to have been true of men and women 
of respectability and influence that they could not so much as write their names, 
and that this state of things applied not only to New England, but to the whole 
country. 
Previous to 1769 girls were taught only by schoolmistresses; and to learn to read 
and sew ‘‘ was for the most part the height of their ambition.” But near the close 
of the century public and private schools accumulated rapidly, and much atten- 
tion was given to female instruction.‘ Still it was some time after the beginaing 
of the nineteenth century before arithmetic was studied to any extent by girls, 
though as early as 1789 it was ordered that both sexes should be taught writing 
and arithmetic, so as to include vulgar and decimal fractions. Not until 1784 
were they permitted to attend a grammar school, and not before 1828, when they 
were placed on an equal footing with the boys, could they be admitted to any pub- 
lic schools for more than half the year, namely, from April to October. In short, 
as Mr. Waterston * says, a hundred and fifty years elapsed from the opening of the 
first public school before any girls were admitted; a hundred and ninety-three 
years before they enjoyed equal privileges with the boys.

of Christ on the Mount, and the Nicene Creed.”

FIRST COMMON SCHOOLS OF NEW ENGLAND. 1183 
It may then be said that ‘‘ with various modifications as to details, but with the 
same objects steadily in view, viz, the exclusion of barbarism from every family,” 
the Puritans were able to carry to a successful issue their nobly-conceived idea of 
“maintaining an elementary school in every neighborliood where there were chil- 
dren enough to constitute a school, and of a Latin school in every large town, and 
a college for higher culture for the whole colony; ” and, moreover, that this sys- 
tem which they established has continued to expand with the growth and deyel- 
opment of the country until it has become the basis for school systems in nearly 
all the States of the Union, besides having had great influence upon education in 
other countries. 
THE NEW ENGLAND ACADEMY. = 
By President 8. C. Bartuert, D. D., LL. D., of Dartmouth College. 
The grammar school, somewhat modified, was brought by our fathers from 
England, established by law in Massachusetts in 1647, and maintained by taxation. 
It spread thence through the other New England States, and did good service for 
the cause of general education. But after a century or more there arose a desire 
for institutions of a higher and more specialized character, pointing more directly 
in the line of a liberal education. It gradually enlisted the most intelligent and 
enterprising men of the various communities and embodied aims and aspirations 
which were indicated by the name they chose for the institution. The name 
“academy” was an ambitious name. Not to speak of its early classic application, 
after the revival of learning it designated an association of learned men, authors, 
or artists for the promotion of science, literature, or art. Hundreds of these organ- 
izations, greater or smaller, were formed in Europe, each with its own specific 
field of study or culture. It showed the high ideal of our forefathers and the 
spirit that prompted them when they chose this name to designate their institution 
for the instruction of youth. 
The New England academy was an incorporated institution, founded and main- 
tained by private beneficence, and managed by a selected board of trustees. It 
‘was, with few exceptions, open to both sexes, The oldest of these institutions was 
the Dummer Academy, at Byfield, Mass. In 1761 Lieutenant-Governor Dummer 
bequeathed his mansion and his farm of 330 acres for this purpose; and in two 
years it was opened under the famous Master Moody, though not incorporated till 
1782. The character and working of the system disclosed itself in this its earliest 
specimen. The roll of trustees of Dummer Academy has included four or five 
presidents of Harvard College, Judges Parsons and Wilde, Edward Everett, Jared 
Sparks, Professor Felton, Timothy Pickering, Elijah Parish, Leonard Withington, 
numerous Members of Congress, and a long list of other men of mark. Its privi- 
leges attracted and before the end of the century sent forth such men as Rufus 
King, Chief Justices Parsons and Samuel Sewali, Professors Webber and Tappan, 
of Harvard; Smith, of Dartmouth; Cleveland, of Bowdoin, a dozen Members of 
Congress, and more than 200 candidates for college. This institution was the 
germ of the whole moyement. 
Samuel Phillips had fitted for college at this academy, and apparently had 
boarded in the family of Master Moody. In 1780 he founded Phillips Andover 
Academy, endowing it at first with $20,000, although at his death his property was 
inventoried at but $15,000. In so doing he recorded the hope ‘‘ that its.-usefulness 
might be made so manifest as to lead other establishments on the same prin- 
ciples.” The hope began to be realized the next year, when his uncle, John Phil- 
lips, founded the Exeter Academy, first endowing it with $50,000, and at his death 
with two-thirds of his estate. The impulse was soon communicated to nearly all  
-P-A-G-E-56
  1184 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
New England. It is not to be overlooked, however, that the unaided enterprise 
of individual teachers was already pushing in the same direction. Twelve years 
before the foundation of the Andover Academy one Simon Williams opened, and 
for twenty years maintained, a noted school in Windham, N. H., drawing pupils 
from Boston, Salem, and other large towns, and numbering among his pupils not 
a few who afterwards became distinguished, 
The establishment of the two Phillips academies was soon followed by the incor- 
‘poration of numerous others. Thus, in the year 1791, the Berwick Academy in 
Maine and five in New Hampshire were incorporated; and in the latter State alone 
during the earlier part of the present century some 50 academies are said to have 
been established before the system of high schools maintained by taxation created a 
competition and a check upon the movement. There were at least 10 in the single 
county of Merrimack. Most of these, being provided only with a building, and 
little, if any, productive funds, and sustained by very moderate tuition fees, at 
length yielded to the unequal competition with institutions supported by taxation, 
and faded away many year's ago, but not until they had done an admirable work 
for the towns of their location, leaving a void which has never been filled. Places 
could be mentioned which, during the existence of the academy, furnished an 
unbroken succession of students for college, but which now scarcely send one in 
a decade, if at all. 
But not a few of these institutions, better endowed, and receiving additional 
endowments in later years, still continue their noble and indispensable work. 
They are the recognized feeders of our colleges and the most powerful allies of 
the cause of higher education. Without attempting an enumeration, I may men- 
tion as specimens, in Massachusetts, the famous Phillips Academy at Andover, 
Williston at Easthampton, Monson Academy, Worcester’ Academy, Cushing 
Academy at Ashburnham, Lawrence at Groton; in Vermont, Barre, Peacham, 
and Saxtons River academies, and the well-known one at St. Johnsbury; in Maine, 
Berwick, Limington, and Fryeburg academies; in New Hampshire, the renowned. 
Phillips at Exeter, Pinkerton at Derry, Appleton at New Ipswich, Kimball Union 
at Meriden, Pembroke, and others; all of which have made a splendid record. 
Many others, now extinct or decayed, have done equally faithful work toward the 
same end. It is the want of such institutions as these fitting schools which has 
been found, outside of New England and especially at the West, a great obstacle 
in the way of the best liberal education, and a chief reason why colleges in those 
regions can not easily compete in quality with the New England colleges. 
They have not the proper feeders, and attention is beginning to be wisely 
directed to the establishment of academies on the New England model, for the 
New England academy has shown itself in several respects not unworthy its 
somewhat ambitious name. In each community it organized and concentrated 
the best minds in promoting the best culture. The founders and guardians of 
. these widely scattered and once numerous institutions have invariably included 
the best element, lay and clerical, in the surrounding region—intelligent, sagacious, 
forceful. The splendid roll of trustees of Dummer Academy has been already men- 
tioned. A similar showing, in kind, if not in extent, could be made of the trus- 
tees of the Phillips academies—Pinkerton, Kimball Union, Monson—and doubtless 
of many others. They have enlisted the men wakeful and watchful for the high- 
est culture of the young. They have also selected and attracted the best teaching 
talent of the times. Commonly, if practicable, there has been a permanent prin- 
cipal, a man strong, well-balanced, and devoted to his work; such men as Moody, 
of Dummér; Adams and Taylor, of Andover; Abbott, of Exeter; Richards, of 
Kimball Union; Hammond, of Monson, and others of like quality, who made both 
their reputation and that of the school. Around these central figures have been 
gathered successively as assistants a great company of the ablest young graduates 
of our colleges, pausing on their way to their several professions, to throw for a
-P-A-G-E-57

time their early force, enthusiasm, and culture into the minds of other young 
men. No one who has not pondered the subject can understand the magnifi- 
cent ability that in its young strength has been educating the New England of 
the past as well as of the present. It would show a noble list of names afterwards 
prominent in professional and public life. You strike their track as well in the 
smaller as in the larger schools. Thus in the little town of Peacham, Vt., we find 
among the former teachers in the academy one of the ablest of the secretaries of 
the American Board, one of the ablest lawyers of New Hampshire, the president 
of a-distinguished college, two college tutors, a brilliant medical professor, and 
other men of power and note. 
Among the assistants at Pinkerton Academy are the names of Chief Justice 
Bell, Prof. E. D. Sanborn, the brilliant Leonard Swain, cut down in his earliest 
prime, and the equally brilliant Jarvis Gregg, still earlier called away. Thaddeus 
Stevens and Daniel Webster were academy teachers. So was the late Roswell D. 
Hitchcock, in a little town of 1,200 inhabitants. So, it may be added, was Dr. R. 
S. Storrs, at Monson. Many a witness yet living can testify what stirring influ- 
ences were these models and vitalizing spirits. They were a revelation and an 
inspiration. Seeds of learning and of thought have thus been scattered over the 
hills and valleys, in the towns and villages of New England by its future jurists, 
statesmen, divines, and educators, destined in due time to bring forth a harvest 
after their kind and to fill the country with their fruitage. 
For these institutions have not only organized, but they have diffused the best 
culture. They first concentrated and then radiated. Widely diffused as they 
once were, they brought home the thought and often the purpose of the higher 
education to every fireside. In this respect they have fulfilled a function not 
accomplished by the later high school. For, though open to all, they were 
designed rather for special privilege than for universal range, and classical train- 
ing was more a primary aim than an incidental and subordinate and scarcely tol- 
erated use. They first suggested to a multitude of young men the purpose of a 
liberal education, and enabled them to accomplish it. They drew, as a magnet, 
the true steel. In many towns where the once flourishing academy has gone 
down for want of funds the contrast between the former constant supply and the 
later dearth of college candidates is a sad one, The registers of the two Phillips 
academies are dazzlingly bright with names of men foremost in all the walks of 
life, many of whom would doubtless have found their way elsewhere and many of 
whom would not. 
But it is not alone, nor perhaps chiefly, the public and professional men to whom 
these influences have been most valuable, but the far larger body of clear-headed 
business men and active workers, sound thinkers and pillars of society in every 
station of life. Here they pursued the studies they elected, often inclusive of the 
classics. Here they perceived the impetus of the same earnest teachers and 
imbibed the whole tone, spirit, and power of the institution. They came invigo- 
rated by the morning walk, often of the longest, and perhaps by their home 
“chores” before and after school. They came, young men and maidens, with 
their tidy apparel, their morning greetings, their sympathetic glances and recog- 
nitions, sometimes, it may be, a stolen word or note, and joining in the homeward 
walk, all and always under the guidance of native chivalry on the one side and 
native modesty on the other, and the benign influence of home life and surround- 
ings. And when they went thence on their several ways of life, many and bright 
were the memories that clustered round that luminous spot. At South Berwick 
on the 1st of July it was a pleasant and impressive thing to see the thousand 
men and women of standing and character, most of them former pupils, who 
came to celebrate the centennial of Berwick Academy. 
One other function of the academy is not to be forgotten, and that by no means 
ED 97 75

the least important. It gave a thoroughly Christian education. These institu- 
tions were quite as often the offspring of religious zeal as of literary enthusiasm. 
For the most part they were founded and conducted in the interest of pure religion 
and high morality. It was part of the system and often of the written code to 
require the reading of the Scriptures and the morning or evening prayer, as well 
as attendance at church, and to prohibit Sabbath breaking and irreverence and 
every form of vice and immorality. Not seldom have these institutions been the 
scenes of deep religious interest and revival. The infidel, the demagogue, and the 
sectarian banish these influences from the high school, the grammar school, and 
the primary.school; but from the academy they can not dislodge them. That 
institution remains and may remain the stronghold of a Christian education. For 
this function, as well as the others, we may thank God and warmly cherish the 
New England academy.

CHAPTER: XXV. 
THE LEARNED PROFESSIONS AND SOCIAL CONTROL! 
‘The qualifications demanded by tho States of the Union for admission to the practice of medicine or 
rations of the French professor for his vocation as a member of a faculty of 
medicine or law—The institutions in which medical and other scientific instruction is given in 
Germany, together with their staff and pay of instructors—The interest of society in and its 
interference with the admission to practice medicine or law.      
  The existence in a community of a group of individuals devoted to the office of 
protection and culture may be regarded as an evidence of an advanced stage of civil- 
ization. The profession of the law is devoted to the protection of property; the 
profession of medicine to the protection of the body; the profession of divinity 
exclusively to the culture of the people. Some of the phases of social life have 
their analogues in the life of animals, but no animals so far as known have any 
special groups of individuals corresponding to those that fill the professions in 
human society. Such professions in fact, as we find them in civilized nations, prove 
the inheritance of their civilization from the Greeks, who were the intellectual ances- 
tors that first investigated the laws éf mind, and from the Romans, who formulated 
the laws that govern advanced social organizations. This ancestry has been appealed 
to for intelligent direction after the terrible epoch of the year 1,000 in the name of 
bodily safety, during the period called the Renaissance in the name of intellectual 
freedom, and at the outbreak of the English Revolution of 1688, and of the French 
Revolution of 1789, in the name of personal equality before the law. Each of these 
social revolutions has been marked—possibly a mere coincidence—by a predilection 
for a certain line of study. During the Middle Ages theology held sway, during the 
Renaissance law, and later its offspring, culture, was the favorite study, and during 
the period of which the present forms a part the study of medicine predominates. 
The close of the Middle Ages is usually placed at 1453, the year of the taking of 
Constantinople by the Turks. In 1400, at the celebrated University of Cologne, in 
the domains of the ecclesiastical monarch called the Archbishop of Cologne, the 
study of jurisprudence, probably in the form of church or “ canon law,” was already 
gaining decidedly on the study of theology proper. Not quite 71 per cent of the 
students of the three faculties of the university were studying law, 27-per cent 
were studying theology, and but 2 per cent were studying medicine. Sixty-five 
years later the law students had increased to 86 per cent, the theological students 
had fallen to 12 per cent, and the medical students were still 2 per cent of the whole 
body of students of law, theology, and medicine of the University of Cologne. 
But a new business had in the meantime arisen—the business of studying for the 
sake of enlightenment; and it is fair to say that, though this effort was the result of 
the study of Greck literature, the way for the comprehension of that literature had 
been paved by the study of jurisprudence. The study of law, says Burke, is one of 
the first of human sciences, worth, in my opinion, all the others put together for 
quickening and invigorating the intellect, but is not so well adapted for opening and 
enlarging it. In 1400 there were 126 students in the University of Cologne, just

half of whom were in the faculty of liberal arts, such as it was then. In 1476 there 
were 607 students in the same university, 81 per cent or more of whom were in the 
faculty of liberal arts, such as it had become, In the same interval theology had 
fallen from 11 per cent of the whole attendance at the university to 1.8 per cent, law 
from 28 to 12.5 per cent, and medicine was nowhere. 
In 1476, however, the University of Cologne had lived nearly a century; it per- 
haps had become antiquated and had ‘‘traditions;” but the University of Halle, 
founded in 1693, represented new ideas in Germany even after the crushing and 
blinding effect of the religious wars and excitement of that and the preceding cen- 
tury. This is shown by statistics of 1693-1700 in the following table:

  It is evident, therefore, that, while in England and France what is represented by 
the German faculty of philosophy was drawing the brightest minds away from the- 
ology in Germany during the eighteenth century, the faculty of theology seems to 
have obliterated the faculties of philosophy and medicine and dwarfed that of juris- 
prudence. It must be remembered that church and state were very intimately con- 
nocveti in Prussia (as has been remarked by Professor Paulsen in his Die Deutsche 
Universitiiten) until the present century, the first decade of which saw the libera- 
tion of the serfs and the right of others than 1oblemen to hold public office. 
Passing now to the eighth decade of the present century, the importance which 
the study of medicine is assuming is at once noticed by glancing at the following 
diagrams (pp. 1189 and 1190); and medicine is the embodiment of science, as juris- 
prudence is of ethics and theology of metaphysics or the immaterial part of the world." 
It is hoped that the intimate relation between the learned professions and the 
susceptibility of an age to favor a certain class of practitioners has been shown, 
In the sequel an attempt is made to show what is being done at home and abroad 
to prepare physicians for their responsibilities in the age of medical science. 
I.—THE PREPARATION FOR THE STUDY OF THE LEARNED PROFESSIONS. 
As the student of the history of medical instruction in the United States runs 
over the discussions of that question since 1850, the date at which an interest in the 
subject began to be awakened, he is impressed by the value which medical practi- 
tioners place upon a “college training,” and their distrust of mere mother wit and 
tne practical instinct of the Anglo-Saxon. As early as 1847 Drs. Ware, Bigelow, 
and Holmes, all teachers of medicine, declare that the only means known to them 
of elevating the profession of medicine is either to require that the applicant for 
admission to a medical school be a graduate of a college or that the course of study 
in the medical school be made to cover a longer period. Though it is evident that 
the second alternative presented by the committee of Harvard professors in the 
report above quoted was adopted when a change was made, about the beginning of 
this decade, yet it is to be borne in mind that in the catalogue of Harvard Univer- 
sity for 1897-98 the following announcement is made: 
Beginning with the year 1901, candidates for admission to regular standing must 
present a college, scientific, or medical degree, or must satisfy the faculty of their 
having equivalent qualifications for membership in the school.

invention, the characteristic of an ‘age of machinery.”

In 1878 so important had this question of the collegiate education of the intending 
medical student become that an association of medical practitioners was formed for 
the purpose of carrying on the propaganda. Those who thus advocated the neces- 
sity of a college course do not appear to have desired the student to study the sci- 
ences such as is taught in the schools the Germans call “real,” when using that term STATE AND THE PROFESSIONS.

in the compound word ‘‘real-schulen,” for the classical or literary training seems to 
be preferred to the merely scientific. But the point to be remarked is that these 
practitioners draw a sharp distinction between the general development of the under- 
standing and the training for a special pursuit. Nevertheless, the alternative ofa 
longer term of study, indicated by Drs. Ware, Bigelow, and Holmes, as asubstitute 
for a course in the humanities seems to be the direction along which the American 
professional schools are moving,

requiring an apprenticeship in an office or graduation from a law school, very little 
consideration being given to the potentialities of mother wit unrefined.! 
The repeated and explicit denunciation by the great national medical and law 
associations of the short cuts into the practice of medicine and law leave no room 
for referring to the matter in veiled language. Foreign Governments are taking 
cognizance of the facts and are inclined to regard American licenses and diplomas 
as of uncertain value. The profession of medicine has pushed up the standard of the 
schools of that profession from ‘‘two years” to four years; but the profession of law 
has not succeeded nearly so well. This appears to be natural when it is considered 
that the advance made by the medical profession is due to the creation and use of 
a new police power or body by the several States, generally called a State board of 
health or examiners. Nothing of this kind has been done to any great extent in the 
case of law. Frequently, indeed, it is the supreme court of a State that makes the 
arrangements for admitting members, its own officers, ‘‘to the bar;” but in other 
instances—the case of Pennsylvania, for example—it is the local court that has com- 
plete jurisdiction. But wise precautions are being made against this unevenness of 
tests even within the same State. West Virginia, during 1897, determined to send all 
applicants for admission to the bar to the faculty of the law department of her State 
University, though leaving full power in the hands of the supreme court, while New 
York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Michigan, Minnesota, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin 
have a ‘State board of examiners” or a permanent “standing committee.” It is 
believed that the Supreme Court of the United States has taken no steps to fix the 
qualifications of those who are to be admitted to practice in the Federal courts, whicii 
are, it is believed, subject to the Federal Government in matters of organization.” 
To show the scope of the inquiry, and to testify to the uniform courtesy which the 
interrogations of the Bureau received at the hands of the attorneys-general and the 
presidents of the State boards of health or of examiners, the reply from Massachu- 
setts is given as a fit introduction to the tabulation which follows. Others equally 
  
1In Chapter VI of second volume of Commissioner's Report for 1889-90 there is a compilation of 
the opinions given both at Harvard and other universities, and also a statement of the action taken 
at Columbia in regard to shortening the college curriculum for intending medical students. 
2The duty of ascertaining the fitness of applicants for admission to practice at the bar of this 
Territory, says Mr. John W. Shartel, to whom the attorney-general of Oklahoma courteously referred 
the Commissioner's inquiry, rests with the district courts. There is no specific requirement as to the 
mode of discharge of this duty. ‘The qualifications of the applicants depend largely upon the indi- 
vidual judgment of each court, and I believe it is the uniform practice of the courts of the Territory 
at the present time, when a motion is made for admission of a person to the bar, to appoint a committee 
of members of the bar, who conduct the examination of the applicant in open court and ply him with 
questions, and the committee then makes its recommendation; and in view of such recommendation, 
and in view of the court’s observations of the answers of the applicant, the court then determines for 
itself whether the applicant shall be 2dmitted. There being no restriction on the power of the court 
in respect to the admission of attorneys to practice law, the way is open for a very low standard of 
professional qualifications, though from my own personal observation for the last four or five years I 
believe tho courts have generally required at least a fair exhibition of merit on the part of the appli- 
cant before admitting him. (Extract from letter to Commissioner of Education by reference from 
Hon. C. A. Calbreath, attorney-general for Oklahoma, in response to the following letter:)

Dear Sim: Permit me to ask your attention to the inquiries made herewith. I am in receipt of 
many letters from abroad which ask for the conditions under which graduates of foreign faculties of 
law are admitted to practico in the United States. As cach State has its own regulations respecting 
such matters, I find it necessary to ask for certain information from you regarding the rules now 
governing the admission to the bar [to practice medicine] in your State. Such other information as 
your convenience may allow you to favor this Bureau with will promote, I am sure, the object the 
inquiries have in view.

interesting are at hand, and the difficulty is to make a selection; but it will be 
noticed that Mr. Fox speaks from intimate experience. 
Boston, Mass., August 23, 1897. 
DeEar Sir: The attorney-general has referred to me, probably because of my 
experience as bar examiner, your letter of August 12, making certain inquiries con- 
cerning admission to the bar in this State, and I take pleasure in answering your 
questions in their order, 
1. Application for admission to the bar is made by petition to the supreme judicial 
court or to the superior court. The applicant embodies in his petition the statutory 
requirements, i. ¢., that he is a citizen of this Commonwealth, or an alien who has 
made primary declaration of his intention to become a citizen of the United States, 
and that he is of the age of 21 years, and prays that he may be admitted to practice 
asan attorney if found to be qualified. By rule of court the petition for admission 
must be accompanied by the recommendation of a member of the bar, and the clerk 
with whom the petition is filed gives public notice of the petition by advertisement 
in the papers. The petition is then referred to the bar examiners, who hold, as a 
rule, two examinations in each county in each year. 
2. As to the effect of a diploma: All candidates, whether graduates of a law- 
schoo] -or not, are required to pass an examination. As a matter of practice the 
examiners are accustomed to ask the preliminary question whether the applicant is 
a graduate of any law school, and that fact is treated by them as of some weight. 
That it is not of controlling weight is shown by the fact that quite a number of law- 
school graduates are rejected at every examination. 
3. I can not say that knowledge of the civil law would be regarded as of any 
weight with the examiners. I am quite sure that no questions of civil law, except 
as incorporated in the common law, are ever put. 
4, A member of the bar of another State files his petition for admission to this bar 
like any other applicant, stating, however, the fact that he has been admitted to 
practice in some other State, and his petition is referred to the bar examiners; but 
he is not subjected to a new examination unless his admission to the bar has been so 
recent as to excite suspicion. The statute upon this question is this: 
Public Statutes, chapter 159, section 38: “A person admitted as an attorney or 
counsellor of the highest judicial court of any other State of which he was an inhab- 
itant, and who afterwards becomes an inhabitant of this State, may be admitted 
to practice here upon satisfactory evidence of his good moral character and his 
professional qualifications.” 
5. The applicant must be an inhabitant of the State and a citizen, or an alien who 
has made the primary declaration, and he must be a person of good moral char- 
acter. The recommendation of a member of the bar is accepted as evidence of this 
last qualification unless objection is made. 
6. 1 do not think it is the practice of the examiners to inquire as to the general 
education of the applicant as distinguished from his professional education. 
Undoubtedly the applicant’s command of English, as shown by his examination 
paper, is of weight. 
7. There is no positive requirement as to the term of professional study, and no 
preference is shown as between law school and office. The result depends for the 
most part upon the examination, which is intended to be thorough. The bar 
examiners have generally felt that a legal education could hardly be acquired 
in less than three years, the length of the course in each of our law schools; and 
we have intended to make it pretty hard for an applicant to pass a satisfactory 
examination who showed less than three years’ study. ~ 
8. Until the present year the bar examiners have been appointed by the supreme 
judicial and superior courts for each county in the State; but by the act of 1897, 
chapter 508, the justices of the supreme judicial court are to appoint hereafter five 
bar examiners, who are to examine all applicants for admission to the bar through- 
out the State. Upon their favorable report the applicant is admitted ‘unless the 
court shall otherwise determine.” 
9. The supreme judicial court and the superior court are alone authorized to grant 
petitions for admission to the bar. 
Very truly, yours, JABEZ Fox.

He must have a knowledge of the law; it is im- 
material how he gets it. A committee appoint- ed by court ascertains fitness. 
Every applicant to practice law, except those who apply for admission upon a license granted in another State, or upon a diploma issued by a law school in the State, shall present to one of the appellate courts proof that he has studied law two years the same studies prescribed by the regularly established law schools in the State, or a course equivalent thereto, naming the books studied, under the direction and su- Pervision of one or amore Licensed lawyers or rms of lawyers, and that the applicant has submitted to satisfactory examinations by such lawyer or lawyers at convenient intervals dur- ing’such period of study, covering progressively the entire course studied, such proof to consist : of the affidavit of the applicant and also of the certificate or certificates of the lawyer. Exam- ination is held in open court. 
   From the letter of the attorney-general,y Hon. ‘William A. Ketchum: The words, “being a vo- ter” has been held by the courts to have no 
  limitation in excluding’ those who are not voters, and women are admitted to practice. The only substantial requirement is that the applicant shall be of good moral character, and at times this may not be very rigidly insisted upon. It seems to be the theory that it is not very impor- tant who is admitted to practice law, as after he has been admitted to practice, if he does not know enough to justify his admission, he will not get any practice anyhow.” 
Must pursue a regular course in the study of law for at least two years in the office of a practicing attorney of this State, or a course of two years of thirty-six weeks each in some reputable law school in the United States. Examination is conducted by three members of the bar, one of whommust bethe attorney-general. The written uestions are prepared by the supreme court; the oral examination is conducted in open court.

II.—THE PREPARATION OF THE PROFESSOR. 
Those who teach in schools of medicine and law may be divided into two classes. 
One class, experts in the thing, sell their knowledge and endeavor to impart their 
skill; another class, expert in imparting the knowledge of the thing and in placing 
the students in the way of acquiring skill, sell their own expertness in approaching 
the untutored mind and devote themselves to teaching and practical study. Pos- 
sibly the latter class is not very large in America, nor in Great Britain, nor in Paris. 
But the universities of Edinburg and the faculty of medicine of Paris have long 
since lost their supremacy as centers of medical education, and the Inns of Court at 
London and the Sorbonne at Paris are not now regarded as the great central 
influence for the common law of England or the civil law of Rome. The legal lights 
of Bentham, Austin, Pollock, Anson, Holland, of Oxford or Cambridge, and of Holmes 
of Massachusetts have supplanted those of Coke, Blackstone, and the Yearbooks, 
and those of Savigny, Ihring, and Puchta, those of Pothier. Thus medicine and law 
are not now generally regarded as necessarily mere trades, and ‘‘sharp lawyers” aro 
no more liked by the legal profession than Jong bills are liked by the physician’s 
patient. With insuperable perseverance the national associations of law and medicine 
haye been laboring to shake their respective professions tree of disreputable or unde- 
sirable elements which would not be found therein were Justinian’s legal precepts 
more carefully observed: Honeste vivere, alterum non laedere, suum cuique tribuere. 
While the great professional bodies in America are slowly making the learned pro- 
fessions learned by arousing public interest in the matter and overcoming popular 
prejudice against the formation of a class of highly respectable if not highly skilled 
physicians and judges drawn from among the people themselves, the democracy of 
France, through its organ, the Government of that Republic, has been very solicitous 
to introduce the best methods of professional instruction inits higher education, and 
it is from the German university that the cue has been taken. 
One of the most valuable and distinctive features of the German university is the 
“nrivat-docent,” whose function in a university is to recommend himself by teach- 
ing some special branch that is too new and untested to be regularly introduced into 
official university instruction, but may be too important to be ignored by the con- 
servatism of the regular official body of instructors. Thus as the common law is 
supposed to be a body of never-changing dicta, though in practice it is ever chang- 
ing by the interpretation of the judges whose ideas are colored by those of the times, 
so the management of the German universities has premeditatedly introduced an 
agency that, by insidiously supplanting the contents of the encyclopedia of the truth 
taught at any given time, never allows the university to grow antiquated. As the 
privat docent is assured of nothing but what the value of his instruction and his 
energy can secure, he is less conservative than the fellow of the English university, 
who is at least assured of his fellowship and the emoluments therefrom arising. 
By the act of November 5, 1877, this ‘‘privat docentism” was introduced into 
France under the name of ‘‘maitre de conferences,” with this difference, however, 
the master of conferences is an official appointee, paid by the Government, which the 
privat docentisnot; the maitre isa part of the university hierarchy, while the docent 
isa free lance, tolerated, even patronized and subsidized, but still on sufferance.' 
The ideas of those who made this great change in higher education in France are 
recounted in the circular letter of advice of the French minister of public instruc- 
tion, March 18, 1878, a part of which is here translated: 
Mr. Recror :? Article 1 of tho 5th of November, 1877, established two distinct groups of maitres de 
conferences. You are aware, Mr. Rector, each of our faculties—in spite of the late great increase in 
    
   
  
11) education nouvelle, p. $1 ct seq., Monsieur Breal, in his Excursions Pédagogiques, does not think 
that the State ought to pay the large number of maitres de conferences that are required in order to 
leaye no lacunie in the university programme. He would nationalize for France the real docent as 
found in Germany, merely changing his namo into French, ‘‘docteur libre;” that is, in English, 
“independent professor or teacher,” doctor in its old university sense meaning ‘‘a teacher.” 
2 France is a university divided into seventeen academics. Over each academy is a rector who has 
charge of educational interests within that academy. It must be understood that ‘Université de 
France” covers all French territory, and that academies are educational counties in this educational 
State or the Université de France.

  STATE AND THE PROFESSIONS. 1207 
  the personnel—has chairs whose duties aratoo large to be performed by one professor, however great his 
diligence and his talent. Moreover, it happens sometimes that a professor has preferences for particu. 
lar parts of his subject and is inclined to dwell on certain topics of his course to tho detriment of the 
others, thus leaving the student on some occasions without other assistance than his books. It is to 
overcome this incenvenienco that maitres de conferences have been attached to chairs. ‘They are to develop the matters that tho professor has merely touched upon (n’aura fait qu’ indiquer) or to repeat 
difficult parts, using the best texts when the matter is literary (dans les lettres), or in conducting 
experiments calculated to show results and their causes when the matter is in the domain of science. 
‘The second group of maitre de conferences has quite another character. The personnel of the facul- 
ties of sciences and letters was created in 1808, if seems, especially in view of the necessities of exam. 
inations, and not long ago there were faculties with only four professors. Even now many are 
represented by five members, a ridiculously inadequate number, especially if one considers the variety 
of routes that new methods of criticism and experimentation have opened up during tho last fifty 
years. Without pretending to afford the profusion of courses that are offered in other countries, the 
Government desires to enlarge the too narrow field of work to which our faculties have been confined 
and to permit the student to moye more freely in the way his individual aptitudes propel him—indeed, 
to fortify those aptitudes by offering means of more extended research and comparisous. Viewing 
the question from this standpoint, the Chamber of Deputies and tho Senate have placed at my disposal 
the necessary sum to provid for 70 maitres de conferences, which are to be placed by the side of tho 
regular chairs, being, as it were, probationary chairs (chaires en experience). . . . They are not 
dependent upon a professor ; their teaching belongs to themselves ; but they are connected with the 
other chairs by an obligation upon which T insist, which is to adapt their lessons to the special work 
of the faculty and to the advancement of the student.    
   
  
  
      
     
    
    
        
     
    The maitres, whose functions are thus described, are appointed for the faculties 
of letters and sciences. In the faculties of law, medicine, and pharmacy those who 
perform the duties of the maitres are called ‘“agrégés” and are appointed on the 
result of a competitive examination,! and hold the place for nine ycars if not pre- 
viously permanently appointed as a professor. The old system of “suppleants” to 
the chairs has been suppressed, the place of the supplementary professor being 
filled by the agrégé [as a chargé de cours], who may be transferred from one faculty 
to another at the will of the minister of public instruction. The supplement was 
appointed for life and was a permanent fixture in the faculty to which he was 
attached. But all this is laid down in ful! detail in the laws which follow; in Note 
A several differences between the American and French university in executive mat- 
ters are discussed.    
  THE POSITION OF THE PROFESSOR, 
Before entering upon the regulations governing the appointment of the agrégés 
and the examination of candidates for degrees in each faculty, it is convenient to 
give title 5 of the decree of December 28, 1885, relative to the organization of the 
faculties of the schools of superior instruction. This title refers entirely to the 
professors who oceupy chairs—“ professeurs titulaires” : 
  Arr. 32. Instruction is given in the faculties and in the higher schools of pharmacy by titular 
professors, assistant professors (adjoint), chargés de cours, and maitres de conferences [the titular 
professors being permanently located, the others not]. 
Apr. 33. Tho titular professors are appointed according to the form prescribed by the decrees of 
March 9, 1852, August 22, 1854, and February 27, 1880. [They are appointed by the minister.) ‘The 
roquest for a transfer from one chair to another in the same faculty is submitted to the consideration 
of the council of the faculty and to the permanent section of the higher council of public instruction. 
‘Thus, also, is tho request for transference from one faculty te another submitted to the councils of the 
faculties interested and to the permanent section of the higher council of public instruction. The 
itment to new chaits is made direetly by the minister. 
No titular professor shall bo displaced from office for an equivalent position unless con- 
sented to by the permanent section of the higher council of public instruction after he has been heard. 
Ant. 35. The titular professors may obtain leave of absence, renewable for five consecutive years at 
the most, on account of sickness or a temporary public mission foreign to public instruction. ‘They 
reecive, in the first case, half of their pay, and in the second case, when the service in which they are 
employed does not lead to a pension, 100 francs, the pay for inactivity [traitement d’inactivité]. The 
titular professors may, with the consent of the council of the faculty or school, be excused from the 
duty of examination, losing, however, a fourth of their pay. This privilege may only be granted when 
the work of the faculty will not suffer, but may it not be granted to a number that are more than one- 
th of the titular professors.

Arr. 36. The suppléances are suppressed. When thelefive granted to the titular professors requires

Arr. 38. The claims of the applicants for chargé de cours and of maitre de conferences are sub- 
mitted to the consideration of the consulting committee of public instruction [ministry of public 
instruction at Paris, first section]. In the faculties of law and medicine the courses and conferences 
are confided to the agrégé : 
Arr, 29. The titular professors are not required to retire on a pension until they are 70 years of age, 
except they ask it or are unable to perform their duties. They may remain in service beyond their 
seventicth year detached (hors cadre) with the consent of the permanent section of the higher council 
of public instruction.

nstruction is filled by 
         
  SALARY OF THE PROFESSOR, 
Previous to 1876 the professors were paid a regular salary of from $800 to $1,200, 
which was increased by their fees as examiners. By the decree of January 14, 1876, 
these examination fees to the profit of the professor were abolished and a fixed salary 
paid instead—#1,200 to $2,200 for the professors in the faculties of law and letters, 
of $1,200 to $2,000 in the faculties of medicine and sciences. The professors were 
classed as professors at Paris, and professors-outside-of-Paris, The practical working 
of the new order of things was unsatisfactory, for it only ‘sowed division among 
colleagues who had passed the same examinations, lowered the dignity of the pro- 
fessors, and introduced into the faculties habits of solicitatiou deeply to be regretted.” 
In 1881 a new classification was made, the professors of the several faculties of the 
country outside of Paris were placed in one of four classes, called first, second, third, 
and fourth class respectively, and the professors of the Paris faculties placed in one 
of tio classes, called first and second class respectively, The following table will 
show the change in salary made by the law of 1881 and the variation in the number 
of titular professors. It will also bring out the difference, so far as the absolute 
amount received is concerned, of being a professor at Paris and a Government pro- 
fessor in another part of France:

APPOINTMENT OF JUNIOR MEDICAL PROFESSORS (“AGREGES”). 
In repealing the third section of the statute of November 16, 1874, governing the 
character of the examination of the junior medical professors, the following reasons 
were given for the change, in the report presented to the higher council of public 
instruction by the commission of the council, to whom the question had been re- 
ferred'. It was found that the old law governing the examination was better caleu- 
lated to ascertain the erudition of the candidate than his personal scientific ability. 
Medicine has changed, says the commission, since 1842, when the original law was 
drawn. Physiology and pathological histology have extended their domain and 
experimental pathology and microbiology have been born. In our day the greatest 
problems of medicine present themselves and are solved in the laboratory. Yetsuch 
is the present organization of the examination of assistant professors that a “young 
worker,” bright and provided with a good memory, is able to pass without having 
put foot within a laboratory, without having made an effort to testify concerning 
his own personality. Success is for the candidate who has retained the most and 
who has been exercised the most in the art of speaking weil on any subject whatso- 
ever. When this supreme end is attained and the candidate is appointed agrégé he 
is 35 or 36 years of age, and it is too late then to turn to the laboratory. He has for- 
gotten the technique that he learned when a student and is ignorant of what has 
been done since his pupilage. 
Now, in the faculties of medicine, the agrégé has a very important réle to fill in the 
direction of the course. He takes part in the assembly of the faculty and in the 
examinations; he fills the chairs. of professors; he takes part, under the title of 
“chargé de conférences” or of ‘‘ cours complémentaires,” in the instruction given by 
the school. It is necessary that tho influence which he exercises over the students 
should be conformable to the scientific tendencies of the day; it is necessary that 
he should know how to utilize the laboratories for the benefit of the student. 
Guided by these general ideas, the commission endeavored to frame a substitnte to 
the third title of the 1874 law, which would not only bring out the erudition of the 
candidate, but also his “professional aptitudes, his scientific aptitudes, and the 
amount of practical instruction he had received.” This substitute was issued as an 
“arrété” July 30, 1887, and reads as follows: 
Art. 37. In the faculties of medicine and in the mixed faculties of medicine and 
pharmacy the agrégés hold their position for nine years; one-third being reap- 
pointed every three years. [They have become titular professors in the meantime, 
if capable. ] 
Arr. 88. There are four sections of agrégés: 
The first, for anatomical and physiolozical sciences, comprehends anatomy, physi- 
ology, and natural history. 
The second, for physical sciences, comprehends physics, chemis 
toxicology. 
‘The third for medicine, properly so called, and medical jurisprudence. 
The fourth for surgery and accouchements. 
Art, 39, The preparatory examination consists of— 
(1) An oral lesson of forty-five minutes, had after three hours of preparation in a 
guarded room upon a question concerning the subject on which the candidate is © 
being examined. The suryeillance shall be provided for by the jury of examination. 
The candidate shall have the aid of such books as the jury may allow. 
(2) A public exhibition by the candidate of his personal work. [During thirty 
minutes the candidate shall say what progress, great or small, he has made in 
science, what problems he has attacked, what obstacles he has encountered, what 
solution he has found. Ifsome candidate gives way to the temptation to exaggerate 
the value of his work, he will thus give to a competent jury the measure of his 
tact.” 
(3) For candidates for the subjects of physics, chemistry, and natural history a 
  pharmacy, and

composition on anatomy and physiology. Five hours are given for this composition, 
which is to take place in a closed room, under the supervision of a member of the 
jury. The composers are not allowed the aid of any printed or manuscript work. 
Art. 40. The final examination consists— 
(1) Of an oral lesson of an hour after forty-eight hours of independent preparation. 
(2) A series of practical evidences: 
(a) For medicine: A clinic lesson upon one or two patients chosen by the jury, 
examined with all the resources of the laboratory ; exercises in pathological anatomy. 
(b) For surgery and accouchements: Same practical proofs as for medicine, and, 
in addition, an operation upon the cadaver for surgery. 
(c) For anatomy: A lesson upon a subject of. descriptive anatomy; practical 
exercises in histology. 
(ad) For physiology: A lesson upon a subject of histology; practical exercises in 
experimental physiology. 
(e) For physics: A lesson upon an experiment in physics; practical exercises in 
physics. 
(f) For chemistry: A lesson upon a chemical experiment; practical exercise in 
chemistry. 
(g) For natural history: A lesson upon a subject of natural history; practical 
exercises in natural history. 
(h) For pharmacy: A lesson upon pharmaceutical operation; practical exercises 
in pharmacy. 
Arr. 41, The subjects and the duration of the practical exercises are determined 
by the jury. 
By the decree of July 30, 1886, the agrégés are made members of the faculty or 
school to which they are attached. They take rank after the titular professors. They 
are members of the assembly of the faculty or school, having a vote if they are con- 
ducting a course of instruction that is provided for by the budget or are conducting 
acourse of practical work, the other agrégés have only the privilege of giving an 
opinion (voix consultative). They participate in the examination; fill the place of 
professors temporarily absent, and conduct courses with the view of rounding out 
the instruction given by the titular professors. In the faculties of medicine the 
number of agrégés having courses shall not be fewer than one-third nor more than 
one-half of the chairs of the faculty. 
The pay of the agrégés for medicine (including pharmacy) and law was 
1876 as follows: fixed in 
  $800 | 400 $600-700 | $6C0-700 
  By fle aon of July 30, 1876, the eens aiiueahe place in the course of instruc- 
tion of an occupant of a chair received in addition $600 at Paris and $400 in the other 
parts of France. 
    APPOINTMENT OF JUNIOR LAW PROFESSORS (AGREGiS). 
By the statute of 1874 the French Aaw of 1857 governing the appointment of 
associate professors of law was modified in that which regards the tests given at the 
competitive examination to the following extent: 
The preparatory or eliminating tests were to be (1) a composition upon a ques- 
tion of French law; (2) two [trial] lessons, one given after four hours of independent 
preparation upon a subject of French civil law, the other after twenty-four hours of 
preparation upon a subject of Roman law. 
The definite tests were to be (1) a composition in Latin upon a question of Roman 
law; (2) two lessons, each given after twenty-four hours of independent preparation, 
the first upon a question of French civil law and the second upon a question selected 
by the judges from another branch of French law; (3) two arguments, one upon a 
title of Justinian’s Digest, the other upon a question from the French civillaw. This 
examination was found to require too much time and to be an unnecessary multipli- 
cation of tests, and it was changed in 1880,  
-P-A-G-E-83
STATE AND THE PROFESSIONS. 1211 
By the regulation of December 27, 1880, the composition in Latin on the Roman 
law was taken out of the definite or second examination and put in the first or 
eliminating examination, ‘for it is necessary,” says the committee of the superior 
council of public instruction, to which the matter had been referred, “that the can- 
didate should have acertain habitude of using the Latin language ;” but one exhibi- 
tion of teaching power was dropped from the climinating examination. The com- 
mittee found themselves, however, unable to drop either of the two lessons required 
in the definite examination, as they were both calculated to show the ability of 
the candidates in different subjects of the law, and hence the completeness of his 
knowledge. They deemed it equally out of the question to drop the argument upon 
a title of Justinian’s Digest, also required in the second examination, as itis ‘“‘a very 
probing test, which assumed that those who passed through it successfully had 
extended knowledge and two indispensable qualities for teaching—that is to say, 
prompiness of mind and command of language;” hut the argument on a question of 
French law was thrown out as an unnecessary test. 
But this remaniement—this rehandling of the competitive examination of the 
aspirant for a junior professorship—was not entirely satisfactory. Candidates 
showed that they were, in spite of the requirements, less and less familiar with the 
Latin language, and to cause them to use a medium of expression with which they 
were not familiar paralyzed or altered theirideas. Again, what was the value of the 
argumentation in point of spontaneity if the contesting parties compared notes 
before the mere exhibition came off? But these reforms, says the commission of 
1890, are of secondary importance. We wish to go very much farther in this matter,! 
fer it appears to us that the competitive examination (concours) as organized by the 
statute of December 27, 1880, is very justly criticised in several particulars which 
we enumerate: 
(1) The duration of the examination is too long. This causes a rather consider- 
able outlay of money by those candidates who are not living with their family, but 
for all it is along drawn out cause of feverish excitation injurious to health, (2) The 
preliminary proofs are too chanceful. A lesson prepared in the short space of four 
hours and two compositions, both upon a special question! are these satisfactory 
criteria upon which to judge of the merits of a candidate? Can an examiner flatter 
himself that he knows anything about the admissibility or inadmissibility on such 
contrivances? Men 30 to 35 well instructed and of brains may have the luck to be 
pitted against subjects with which they are unfamiliar or which to them are distaste- 
ful, sro trivial, or far fetched, and thus they are thrown out, eliminated, to the 
advantage of the other candidates who haye not been superior but more lucky than 
they. (3) The tests do not correspond to the curricusm in the faculty. These tests 
are exclusively confined to Roman and the French law and do not permit certainty 
in diagnosing the special aptitudes of each candidate, nor do they interrogate those 
who are to treat the history of law, public law, and political economy. 
The committee having thus reported, the minister immediately (1890) notified the 
fourteen faculties of law that the tests were no more in relation with the curriculum

It is rather interesting to compare the position of the important faculty of law of 
Paris at the date of 1890 and 1895, when a new curriculum had been promulgated on 
each occasion. }

  The plan of 1895, say the Parisian faculty of law, is, from a scientific stand- 
point, good, but from a practical standpoint it has disadvantages. The candidates 
will devote themselves to the study of one of the sections and will become narrow 
specialists, so as not to be cf use when they become professors and are called upon 
to take a university view of affairs. To obviate this the candidate must take two 
doctors’ degrees—one the degree juridique, the other politique—so as to assure the 
indispensable all around legal culture,

Before passing to the relation of the professions of medicine and law to the State 
it is necessary to speak of the laboratory, the hospital, and the library. The hos- 
pital may be sufficient to make the practitioner, but the laboratory and the librar 
indispensable to make the savant. It has been remarked before that the American . 
and English schools are in charge of practitioners, while those of Germany—and 
now of France—are directed by a pedagogical class ef professors. Of nothing con- 
nected with their higher instruction in 1870 were the French more ashamed than 
their laboratories. Two reports upon improvements to be made in that respect were 
presented by Professor Wurtz, and they are both used freely here to illustrate the 
necessary accessories to medical instruction. are

Tn the physical and natural sciences, says M. Wurtz in his report to the minister 
of public instruction in France, the demonstration of the facts is the basis of all 
solid progress. Observe how science is cultivated in a modern laboratory. It is no 
more an isolated effort—it is work in common. When knowledge was a mystery 
and the art of experimentation a secret, an operator might be seen bending over his 
furnaces attended by one or two adepts. But now that the importance of the sci- 
ences is increasing as they are being called in to aid civilization, it has become neces- 
sary to diffuse scientific truths. In fact, it is a company of workers who group 
themselves about a master, Each profits by his maker’s teaching and example, and 
by the work of his colleagues, In such an environment the noblest emulation exists— 
that is to say, energy and inspiration are born as the inclination develops, and are 
perpetuated in the great centers where flourish the arts. Thus a laboratory is not 
only a refuge for science, it is a center of propaganda; it is a school. 
This panegyric on the value of the laboratory is conclusive evidence of its indis- 
pensableness, coming from so high an authority as M. Wurtz, who rises to the dignity 
of his mission which is to remodel the methods of teaching the physical and natural 
sciences in the faculties of sciences and of medicine in France. But there is another 
sido to the question, which has been expressed by Dr. Le Fort in these terms: ‘The 
place to study medicine is in the hospital, and only in the hospital. Some medical 
savants devote themselves to laboratory study. Nothing can be better. But for the 
physician, who should above all things learn to care for and, if he can, cure his 
patients, the only school is the hospital. There may be courses in hygiene and 
medical jurisprudence, but there can be no theoretical course in medicine, none in 
surgery; there is only a course of clinics, and the professor at the same moment 
teaches the students the theory (of which they have obtained the principal notions 
from the books) and the practice.” 
Let us now inquire what M. Wurtz found in Germany in the way of ‘Practical 
high studies.” Hoe found four kinds of institutions: Chemical laboratories, physio- 
logical laboratories, anatomical laboratories, and laboratories of pathological 
research in anatomy and ‘experimental medicine.”   
THE LABORATORIES OF CHEMISTRY. 
The chemical laboratory, according to M. Wurtz, is the result of the work of Liebig 
(under whom M. Wurtz studied at Giessen). Liebig's example was not lost. During 
the next twenty years many laboratories were constructed, and brought together a

great number of practical students. It will suffice to mention the names of only the 
more important: Carlsruhe, Heidelberg, Giéttingen, Greifswald, Munich, and Zurich, 
which in some sort mark the transition from the old establishments of this nature 
to the pretentious structures which subsequently appeared at Bonn, Berlin, and

Leipzig. It will be observed that these laboratories are special colleges attached to 
the university, not outhouses or pretty little architectural studies by talented artists, 
It must also be observed that the establishments about to be described were buil 
twenty-five years ago. It is nothing that still smells of varnish that is being hero 
pictured, but tho installation of science, which has caused so many Americans to 
study in Germany.

LABORATORIES OF PHYSIOLOGY. 
Physiology is the daughter of anatomy, says M. Wurtz, and there was a time 
when the knowledge of the organs of the human body and the ideas which dissec- 
tions gaye were the points of departure and ihe only methods for research, or rather 
inductions in physiology. We forced ourselves to divine a function by study 
its look and form and its place in the system, and we tried to catch in some way its 
living action by experiments on living animals. This method has led to great dis- 
coveries, By it Harvey discovered the circulation of the blood, and Haller during 
the eighteenth century gave such an impetus to physiology. But it was only good 
because it was fruitful, not because it was sufficient, for it went little 1 
external appearances of the facts, and for the most part left the investigate 
ignorance of the true nature of the connection of the facts. Thus, what uncertainty 
as to the facts! How many hypotheses in interpreting them! What an uncertain 
basis for medicine is a physiology full of conjectures! A new era epened at the end 
of the eighteenth century. Respiration is a slow combustion, and as such is the

source of animal heat. The part played by physics in the progress of physiology is 
not less great since the discovery of the source of animal heat. Galvani’s discovery 
gave birth to the thought that the nervous agency of the body had been found. 
Undoubtedly the hope was premature, but if the nervous agency is unknown, we 
can measure its rate of propagation along the nerves. But questions of this kind 
are only to be attacked by the aid of the most advanced methods and the most deli- 
cate instruments of modern physics. To these methods and instruments experi- 
mental physiology appeals. Formerly the scalpel and the bistotiry were the principal 
instruments employed in experimental physiology ; to-day it claims ail the resources 
of a combined laboratory of chemistry and physics. But this is not all. The very 
science itself is pushing alead with immense strides. It not only describes the 
exterior form and the relations of the human organs, but it also penetrates into the 
intimate structure. The anatomy of the tissues inaugurated by our Bichat, enlarged 
and transformed by microscopical research, has become, under the name of histology, 
an important branch of human knowledge. The microscope has made known the | 
framework of the tissues, the morphological constitution of the humors, and the struc- 
ture and evolution of the organs. But is this all, merely to give minute description 
of the form and structure of anatomic destructions in aid of classification?. By no 
means. The conquests of histology have acquired great repute in furnishing light 
to normal and pathological physiology. Ought not the study of the secretions of 
the glands be based upon the previous study of their texture? It is evident thata

LABORATORIES OF PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY, 
The pathological anatomy that Latnnec, Cruveilhier, Rokitanski, and others had 
elevated to the rank of a science, bas taken a considerable development since the 
microscope has been applied to the study of organic alterations. This new way has 
been opened and entered upon with great éclat by the celebrated author of Cellular 
Pathology, Professor Virchow, and by many other eminent work Their dis- 
coveries bring to medicine unceasingly a rich harvest of useful material. The micro- 
scopic examination of the organs is indispensableas a complement to chemical study. 
In the French hospitals it is the physician who has attended the defunct patient that 
performs the autopsy. The autopsy is differently made in Germany. It is neither 
the professor of the clinic nor his assistants that makes the autopsy; it is made by 
the professor of pathological anatomy, and he performs his duty in the presence of 
the students with the confidence and the authority of an expert and of one filling a 
high position. The organs affected by disease are placed aside for examination by the 
students, who note their exterior appearance. Subsequently, in another place, micro- 
scopic examinations are made. But it is necessary not to confound these demonstra- 
tions with the methodic course of pathological anatomy, which is independent and 
during which the professor exhibits matters furnished. by the daily autopsies. The 
Pathological Institute of Vienna will serve to illustrate the fourth form of the insti- 
tute of the German University, which had no like in America until long after the 
idea had become commonplace in Europe. Perhaps in America even to-day such 
an institute would be called a college, if not a “university.” 5 
But Professor Virchow himself has spoken upon the topic of pathological anatomy 
for the World’s Fair exhibit of the German universities at Chicago. The history of 
pathological anatomy, he says, was until a yery recent date, closely connected with 
that of anatomy. Indeed the pathological anatomy of the domestic animals served 
as a model upon which to build that of man. But it was long before the retarding 
grip of tradition could be loosened so the worth of the autopsy might be recognized. 
“JT had the especial good fortune,” ho says, ‘‘to be the first to teach officially this 
science. In 1849 I occupied the first professorial chair in pathological anatomy 
in Germany. From Wiirzburg I was called to Berlin, and there it happened ‘that 
pathological anatomy was first separated from the chair of anatomy proper and 
became an independent branch of investigation, and then throughout Germany. But 
let us briefly examine,” he continues, ‘the character and extent of the practical 
principles that must guide us in this science.” 
1. The autopsy must become a regular part of the law of the Jand (Kranken- 
dienst). ‘The law of every couniry must not permit, as far as possible, the body of a 
person dying in a hospital to be taken away from science. To make a beginning in 
this line will be very difficult, but with patience and perseverance it will be eventu- 
ally recognized by the people that the autopsy is necessary to enable the physician 
to conquer disease. It must become a prejudice (Sitte) that a corpse shall be dis- 
sected like the Egyptians had the custom of disemboweling their dead and draining 
the brain out through the nose to preserve it asamummy. When again it shall 
become customary, as of old, to cremate the body, then the custom (sitte) to have the 
body dissected will casily become general. 
2. The pathological dissection must be done according to exact rules. It is self- 
evident that the dissection must make clear its peculiarities as far as they a 
nizable, and that it should be adopted to show the purpose (Gang) of the section 
and the relations to other parts of the body, as more particularly set forth in The 
Technique of the Section as Conducted in the Morgue of the Charity Hospital, 
Virchow, 1893, fourth edition. 
8. Just as the technique of pathological anatomy is different from the technique of 
the “anatomical theater,” so are different instruments required, especially to the end 
of quicker completion of the section. For instanee, larger knives are required. 
4, The next consideration is the making of good accounts (Protokolle) of the trans- 
     e recog-

actions and {heir collection in a library provided for them in tho building. A good 
protocol is a circumstantial and time-consuming work, and it happens in consequence, 
even in well-conducted institutions that they are not made. Nevertheless the exist- 
ence of these archives is the basis for a sure utilization of the results of the autopsy 
in medical science. 
5. To this library of records should be joined a museum of pathological specimens, 
No institution should be without this. It has the double end to provide the required 
. material for objective study in a logieal order and at the same time to preserve an 
evidence of important facts. But this matter is not capable of being expressed in 
a general way. : 
THE NEW “EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY ” AND ITS INSTALLATION. 
Professor Wurtz’s work has mainly been used in the foregoing descriptions. He 
saw what he describes, and studied calmly what he saw. His account, though not 
“up to date,” as the saying is, is accurate, and theréfore contains all the essentials for 
some time tocome. But in the meantime the physiological investigations concern- 
ing the ‘nervous agency,” which he mentions, have given rise to a new form of insti- 
tute or laboratory, called the Laboratory of Psycholegy. In 1878 Professor Wundt 
opened the first laboratory of this kind at Leipzig. As we shall follow Professor 
Binet in noticing this new creation, it will be a French institution—the one of 
which M. Binet himself is associate direetor—that will be introduced. 
There exist two kinds of psychology—that called experimental and that called 
morbid. The last studies hypnotism, hysteria, mental diseases, and the various 
troubles of the sensory and motor nerves. The latter kind does not enter into the 
work of the Paris laboratory of experimental psychology, which deals with healthy 
individuals. Tho laboratory in Paris was created in 1889, and attached to the Ecole 
Pratique des Hautes Etudes, or rather to the section of the natural sciences of that 
university, and a director and four other professors were appointed. It is now installed 
at the new Sorbonne, occupying four rooms: (1) a large room for demonstrations in 
common; (2) an office for the director, where are stored the apparatus, etec., of a 
delicate character; the room also serves for special research; (3) a room which con- 
tains the library, a glass case for the glassware, etc.; the room is used for macro- 
scopic and microscopic researeh on the nervous system; (4) the fourth room is 
exclusively reserved for the use of the master of conferences; but a small room 
opening into this room is used for a dark chamber in experiments upon vision. There 
are also two other small rooms for chemical work, ete. ‘In America laboratories of 
this kind are extremely numerous,” says M. Binet, ‘but we lack details concerning 
their organization. Those of which we positively know the existence are situated 
in New York, Philadelphia, Worcester, New Haven, Providence, Ithaca, Medissina (?), 
Chompen (?), Harvard (Cambridge), Chicago, Toronto. In Europe the following cities 
possess laboratories: Leipzig, Gittingen, Bonn, Berlin, Copenhagen, Gronengen 
(Holland), Geneva, Liege, Brussells, Stockholm, Oxford, and Cambridge.” As there 
are so many of these institutions in America, more than half of the whole number, 
it may be of interest to state just what M. Binet thinks the “psychologic method” 
is as compared with physiological psychology. It will be observed that M. Binet is 
a keen logician, and is rather incredulous as to the recording of ideas about a mind 
without a mind. As the following matter is taken from his “Introduction & la 
psychologie expérimentale,” there can be no impropriety in introducing the Baconian 
aphorism that the mind requires instruments and aids in investigating nature, since 
M. Binet points out that the instruments and aids are not mind. 
‘There has been some disagreement as to the lines of demarkation between psychol- 
ogy and its neighbor—between, in fact, psychology, properly so-called, and the 
physiology of the nervous system. But our studies haye a characteristic which, if 
understood, will preyent confusion. Everybody knows what the word introspection 
means. Its synonyms are self-consciousness, consciousness (sens intime, sens interne, 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
STATE AND THE PROFESSIONS. 1223 
conscience, etc.). It is the act by which we perceive directly that which is going on 
within us—our thoughts, memories, and emotions. This introspection, it is possible 
to say, is the base of psychology, and it characterizes psychology so precisely that 
every study which is made by introspection must be called psychological, and 
every study which is made by any other method belongs to another science. We 
(MM. Binet, Philippe, Courtier, and Henri, the professors of tho Paris Laboratory) 
beg to insist upon this point, for the late studies in physiological psychology have 
sometimes lost sight of the fact. 
It is proper to explain, continues M. Binet and his colleagues, that we are taking ae 
word introspection in the largest sense. Frequently it is used in the sense of with- 
drawing within one’s self for the purpose of reflecting and analyzing the contents 
of the mind or, as Berkeley puts it in plain English, of the thing I call myself. But 
this is only one of many cases, and not the best, where introspection may be used. 
When many persons are asked to observe an indicated object; when many persons 
are interrogated upon the impressions made upon their consciousness, and these 
answers are collated; when these persons are submitted to regulated tests, and then 
relate the impressions they received; finally, when, without letting them know of the 
fact, their gestures, play of facial expression, their words, judgments, and conduet 
are observed, and the emotions and passiofis which are ruling them are inferred from 
these outward signs—in all these cases, and many others which we could add to the 
list, we arrive cither directly or indirectly, with certainty or with chances of error, 
to read the mental state of a person and to represent them to ourselves as if we had 
ourselves experienced them. Yet, to study phenomena in this way is to use intro- 
spection and consequently psychology. 
M. Charles Richet, director of the Revue Scientific, has put forth a statement 
which may be cf interest in this connection. Under the rather vague name of 
“fonction cérébrale,” he speaks of the mind as having a “caractére psycholo- 
gique.” He says the other organic apparatuses, such as the liver, the heart, ovaries, 
and muscles, have functions which are material and reducible to exterior-lke 
phenomena, whether chemical, dynamic, or morphological; but the brain apparatus 
(le ceryeau) has a function which certainly does not exist in the tissues, for it is the 
seat of consciousness and intelligence (il a la conscience et lintelligence). This 
conscience and this intelligence widely separates (créent un fosse profond) the 
psychology of the brain and that of the other organs. So wide is this separation 
that the knowledge (la connaissance) of the soul, of the me, is the object of a 
science—the science of psychology—that it is frequently attempted to separate from 
physiology properly so called. But, notwithstanding every effort of the pyscho- 
logues, psychology is mixed up with the physiology of the brain apparatus 
(cerveau), although the methods of psychology differ in many respects from the 
methods of physiology. But, although the brain (cerveau) is the seat of the con- 
sciousness, it possesses also other apparatuses which have simple physiological func- 
tions through which, like the other organs, it produces chemical and dynamical 
phenomena.   
        INSTITUTES FOR THE STUDY OF MICROBES CALLED BACTERIA, 
  When Leenwenh saw that the growth called tartar cortained a “ great num- 
ber of little animaleule which acted in a remarkable manner,” he contented him- 
self with naming their different forms A,B, C,etc.! Since then many efforts have 
been made to classify these “little animals,” but the syllogism in natural science 
is a very uncertain friend in classification unless fortified by a thorough knowledge 
of properties rather than a collection of names. ‘By their works shall ye know 
them” is particularly eupropriate to the microbe.

  1224 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Opinion seems unanimous in deeming the microbe called bacterium (Gaxrijpior, 
a stick) a vegetable, but the greatest bewilderment reigns as to its place in the 
botanical kingdom. The general tendency is to approximate it {o the alge and 
the mushrooms; that is to say, to plants having chlorophyll and plants not having 
chlorophyll. Thus they may be provisionally located in Sach’s ‘‘subkingdom,” or 
embranchment, as the French call it, of Thallophytes, in which the class alge and 
the class mushrooms regard each other, so to speak, from two botanically opposite 
-poles of nutrition. 
Some of these bacteria are dangerous, some are Larmless. The one known as 
the bacillus of tuberculosis (consumption) is undoubtedly dangerous, but Professor 
Koch announces that in some minutes, or, if the “culture” is thick, in some hours, 
an exposure to the sunlight will kill it dead. ‘Entirely different (tout autre) is 
the action of light upon the lower mushrooms,” says Dr. Arloing. But then the 
“composition of the atmosphere” of the culture and the pressure to which that 
atmosphere is submitted ‘‘ profoundly modify the vegetation of microbes,” and we 
have certain of this gentry that will flourish only in a vacuum or in an atmos- 
phere of carbonic acid, while others only work well in an oxygenated atmosphere 
like that we breathe. The bacillus anthracis, originally named bactévridie, is usu- 
ally taken as a type of the bacterium that works well in the air. On trial, it will 
kill a steer in an hour and a half. In man, the autopsy shows black blood, 
intestinal hemorrhages, and the gall bladder gorged with blood. The bacillus 
anthracis is therefore an aerobe, The bacillus septicus, more popularly known as 
“gangrene,” is usually taken as a type of the microbe that does not work well in 
the air, though always lying in wait in hospitals for an amputation not performed 
under cover of a spray of disinfectant, as practiced by the English physician Lister 
during the sixties. This septicemia-producing microbe is a human infliction, and 
picks out the enfeebled—women giving birth to children, men losing arms or 
legs by the surgeon's knife. The autopsy shows that the muscles have been most 
violently inflamed, the body bloated; in short, the living being has died putrefying. 
It is now not the blood that is robbed of its oxygen, but the impure atmosphere 
surrounding dead flesh or dried blood calls the aerobe into life, and having once 
started in the way of fermentation, it pulls apart the tissues of the body, propagating 
in the atmosphere it thus produces.! There is a bacterium, says M. Trouessart, which 
is excessively common, which is called bacterium termo, or microbe of impure water. 
It is perfectly harmless, and is found in the human mouth. 
These three kinds of microbes have been spoken of as though they were large, but 
they have a very small appearance under the highest powers of the microscope, 
and only the initiated can separate them. Hence the necessity of an institute or 
place where the investigations of the professor are assisted by the presence and 
the cooperation of those who are themselves about to profess the study of med- 
icine. “If we are spared that customary portion of this lecture,” says Professor 
De Bary, ‘‘which shows the importance of a subject, because the educated pub- 
lic knows that a large part of all health and disease in the world is dependent 
on bacteria, it becomes the moro necessary to give prominence to the reverse side 
of the question and to call attention to the fact that the problem can only be solved 
by quiet scientific examination from every possible point of view of those objects.” 
If there are plants which can attack the weakened living body and come out vic- 
torious in the struggle against the natural recuperatory energies of the human sys- 
tem, appropriating its elements as a mushroom does those of a fermenting dung 
heap, and if there are others which are essential to the digestive processes of the 
human body, it would appear that physiology takes on a new face and becomes a   
1Dr. Arloing thinks that it is absolutely necessary for every microbe to have oxygen in order to 
live and grow.

question as to what microscopic plants live in beneficial communion or “ sym- 
biosis” with the living human organism, and what plants, “symbiotically,” are 
destructive to it. 
In 1888 the Pasteur Institute was opened. The orator of the day, the professor of 
protection against hydrophobia, called it an antirabies institute (Vinstitut anti- 
rabique). M. Pasteur, however, in his remarks on that occasion, characterized it 
somewhat differently. “For myself,” he said, “if Ihave had the happiness, gen- 
tlemen, during the course of my investigations to ascertain some principles that 
time has confirmed and rendered fruitful it is because nothing has been refused to 
me by my country or my friends in my efforts to reduce the effects of microbic poisons 
npon men not only in applying the prophylactic method against hydrophobia, but 
also the study of virulent and contagious diseases. The professor of the prevention 
of hydrophobia will be M. Granchéa (the orator of the day), assisted by three physi- 
cians, while the minister of public instruction has authorized my oldest pupil 
and coworker to give here 
the instruction in biologie 
chemistry with which he 
is now charged in the fac- 
ulty of sciences at the 
Sorbonne. M. Chamber- 
Jand will be charged with 
the relations of microbes 
and hygienic precautions, 
and Dr. Roux! will teach 
the relations of microbes 
and the practice of medi- 
cine. Two learned Rus- 
sian physicians, Metchni- 
koff and Gamaléia, have 
volunteered their ‘assist- 
ance, and are charged 
with the form of the infe- 
rior organisms and com- 
parative microbiology.”

giving light to medicine 
by being organized into schools where study is research under direction, the other 
branch, the branch of vegetable biology, is being organized in the same way. Some 
attention has been given in another part of this report to the researches of Messrs. 
Lawes and Gilbert, of Saussure, Boussingault, and Liebig, of Pasteur, Wilfarth, and 
Hellriegel, Schloesing and Miintz, and of Darwin. But the laboratory of Sachs, 
at Wiirzburg University, is probably the earliest typical institute for the purpose of 
investigating the nature of vegetable life? In America each State has a station 
known as experimental, for which Congress annually appropriates $15,000, a large sum 
as compared with the amounts given to the institutes of Germany, though it must 
be remembered that a dollar in Europe will purchase much more than in the eastern 
United States, and very much more than on the Pacific coast. These American 
experiment stations are not seemingly “institutes,” but are a hybrid between the

Rothamsted Experimental Station and the establishment known as the Institut 
National Agronomique at Paris, France. The work of the Rothamsted Station is 
given on page 955. Here we are concerned with the National Agricultural Institute 
at Paris.! 
The outburst in 1848 for popular government and the dissemination of intelligence 
which created the second French Republic, established at the magnificent suburban 
resort of the French kings called Versailles an institution named an agricultural 
institute. The coup d’e’tat that founded’ the second Napoleonic empire in the 
course of two or three years ousted this school from the outbuildings and the park 
of this palace, and the school was no more heard of. The third French Republic of 
1875, however, established an institute agronomique whose function was declared to 
be “to study and to teach the sciences in their relations with agriculture.” The 
scheol was joined to the School of Arts and Trades (Conservatoire des Arts et 
Métiers) at Paris. There was a question as to the advisability of locating an agri 
cultural institute in a city. This fact decided that question, ‘‘The great city of 
Paris alone possessed the savants who are the keystone of the vault of higher edu- 
cation, and the libraries, museums, and all the auxiliary riches of the same nature 
which are indispensable to thorough scientific studies (aux fortes études scien- 
tifiques).”? M. Boussingault was put in general charge of the laboratories, M. 
Schloesing was appointed professor of chemistry applied to agriculture, and his col- 
league in the discovery of the microbous ferment in the soil, M. Miintz, had charge of 
the practical course inchemical manipulations. But inthe course of twenty years the 
instruction has been very greatly changed, though the general plan is the same. In 
the first place, in 1882 the school was removed from the Conservatoire des Arts et 
Métiers and installed at the corner of Claude Bernard and Arbaléte streets, quite 
near to the Sorbonne, and “‘two steps from the Jardin des Plantes.” 
Each “salle @’études” is capable of holding ten students. They are in rows 
occupying the front along Claude Bernard street. The library contains 16,000 
volumes, and is particularly rich in the literature of agriculture, both French and 
foreign. Tho micrographic or botanical dissecting hall will hold forty students, and 
is fitted up with light tables. The laboratories are numerous and large. In one 
eighty students may work at the same time. The professor director has a labora- 
tory, so has the professor of chemical analysis and demonstrations, the demonstrators, 
preparators, ete. There is also a “laboratory of fermentations,” of mechanical and 
hydraulic agriculture, of zootechny. Then there are the museums on the third floor, 
In all making a very imposing display and offering every inducement to the 
inhabitants to do something worthy of their opportunities. 
  THE TRADE INSTITUTE OR MUSEUM. 
The conservatism of the French Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers has been pic- 
tured by the late Viollet le Duc in his How to Make a Draftsman, a book which 
should be constantly in the hands of those who are ambitious to direct ‘industrial 
education” in America. M. Viollet takes his young draftsman hither and thither in 
the world, but the-Germans, like the English in their South Kensington Museum, 
collect the productions or imitation thereof of foreign nations past or present ina 
gewerbe, that is to say a trade, institute, which is not an exchange or place for sell- 
ing things, but a place for showing how other people make better things than the 
Germans do, and therefore conquer them in competition. In the next report of this 
Bureau it is hoped to lay this movement before those interested in the development 
of industry and competition in the world’s markets, It will suffice on the occasion 
to show the outside appearance of the most recently erected of these institutions.

IV.—Tue Is ST OF THE STATE. 
  The active reform in medical education began about 1880. ‘In the early part of 
that year the American minister to Germany, Hon. Andrew D. White, addressed 
a letter to the honorable the Secretary of State, Mr. Evarts, by whom tho letter was 
forwarded to this Department. Mr. White had been requested by the German 
authorities to give information respecting the diploma presented by a man named 
Volland, which had been granted him by the “ American University of Philadelphia.” 
Mr. White’s letter is as follows: 
After looking through the correspondence on record in this legation and sceking in vain for the 
rame of the institution in the list of colleges and universities published by the Bureau of Educa- 
tion in the Department of the Interior at Washington, my answer was unfavorable to Volland’s 
     claim That such cases as these havo brought disgrace upon the American system of advanced 
education and upon the American name in general is certain. ‘This has been recently revealed to me 
incidentally ina curious way. Ina very successful play now running at the Royal Theater in this 
city (Berlin), a play written, strangely enough, by a judge of ono of the highest tribunals in the 
Empire, one of the characters, in casting a reflection upon another, who is dignified with the title 
of doctor, declares a belief that the latter had simply bought his degree in America; and in a recent 
novel by a popular author here, the scoundrel of the book, having escaped justice in Germany, gocs to 
America, and is, at last advices, very comfortably settled and practicing medicine with a sham diploma 
which he has bought for money. 
  Immediately the police powers of the States were invoked to remedy this evil, and 
since that date we have seen State after State create boards of medical examiners or 
   
-P-A-G-E-102
  1230 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
empowering boards of health to act as such. Law, too, has felt the swing of the 
movement in medicine. But both in the case of medicine and law there are difficul- 
ties to be encountered in practice that theory perhaps is too disinclined to see. The 
principal of these are (1) the control of the States, making forty-five jurisdictions 
to be taken into consideration, and (2) the fear of creating a close corporation or 
monopoly. Perhaps by an arrangement among the medical and judicial authorities 
of the States uniformity might be introduced all over the Republic, while the State, 
retaining the administrative power in its own hands, might prevent there being a 
professional monopoly by legislating in such a way as to prevent the accomplish- 
ment of the purposes for which monopolies of a dangerous kind are formed. Great 
Britain, after whose early practice our own is formed, presents us with an example 
both for what is good and for what appears undesirable in legislating upon this 
subject. 
The earliest effort of a State to regulate, or rather to coordinate institutions 
maintained and managed by private persons or corporations, is New York. That 
State, in 1784, created a board of regents of the University of New York, which is 
a State body, composed of the governor, the lieutenant-governor, the secretary of 
state, the state superintendent of public instruction, and nineteen members chosen 
by the State legislature. The duties of this board are to approve the incorporation of 
colleges and secondary schools, to visit and inspect such institutions, to examine 
into their condition and methods, and to grant honorary degrees above the degree 
of magister artium, and to establish examinations for the bestowal of a degree of 
any grade. From time to time since 1866 the board has also been called upon to 
examine candidates for the degree of doctor of medicine and of dentistry and to 
confer those degrees, to establish a standard of graduation from the secondary 
schools (which is also the entrance requirement to any college in the State), and, 
finally, to examine candidates for matriculation in a law or medical school or other 
place for the study of law or medicine, as to the literary qualifications of such 
candidates. 
By a law passed June 26, 1895, the State of Pennsylvania instituted an official 
body, which has control of the incorporation and the course of study of all institu- 
tions empowered to confer degrees established after the date of the act. This official 
body is styled the College and University Council of the State of Pennsylvania, and 
its members are the governor of the State, the attorney-general, the superintendent 
of public instruction, and nine persons appointed by the governor, three of whom 
are presidents of undenominational colleges or universities of the State of Pennsyl- 
vania, three others are presidents of denominational colleges, and the remaining 
three members have some relationship to the common schools of the State. No new 
institution may be chartered by the College and University Council unless it has 
property amounting to $500,000 to be exclusively used in education, has a faculty of 
six or more regular professors who are to devote their entire time to instruction, 
and requires four years of study for a degree, the requisites for entrance upon each 
course of study leading to a degree being fixed by the College and University Coun- 
cil. But a university or a college empowered before the passage of the act creating 
the College and Uniyersity Council to confer degrees may continue to do so pro- 
vided, in the case of the university, it have $500,000 in property orcapital, and in the 
case of the college, $100,000. The recent action of the State of Pennsylvania is the 
most decisive step taken in the United States for the regulation of granting degrees, 
which is the object of the law, for it states explicitly within itself that its provi- 
sions shall not apply to institutions possessing capital stock and established for pur- 
poses of private profit or gain. This law is too recently enacted to speak of its 
results. 
In the United States the admission to the bar of persons who desire to practice in 
the Federal courts has been left by Congress in the hands of the Supreme Court of 
the United States. In the States, though invariably it is a court of law which 
licenses the applicant, much diversity exists in the manner of ascertaining his qualifi- 
    
-P-A-G-E-103
  STATE AND THE PROFESSIONS. 1231 
cations. In some States the local courts decide upon this question; in others it is 
the supreme court of the state that establishes the rules by which the applicant’s 
knowledge is tested. It is very generally the case, however, that the examination 
is made by a committee of the court. A notable innovation on this time-honored 
method is that of the State of West Virginia, which sends all applicants who desire 
to be admitted to the State bar to the faculty of law of the University of West Vir- 
ginia. This body examines the applicants and certifies the result of its examination 
to the supreme court of the State, by which final action is taken.! 
Tho licensing of persons who desire to practice medicine is entirely in the hands 
of the legislatures of the several States. These bodies have delegated their powers 
to certain boards of medicine, sometimes called a State Board of Health, sometimes 
a State Board of Examiners. The discretionary power of the majority of these 
boards is very large. There are now eighteen States having the rule to admit no 
one unless he has been examined by the board of that State. These States are 
thus treating not only each other, but all other sister States of the Union as though 
they were foreign countries. A very interesting question, indeed, is raised in this 
matter by a correspondent of the Bureau, in answer to a recent inquiry, who replies 
that “The law of his State does not permit reciprocity, which in his opinion is an 
error and unconstitutional.” 
In the tabulations which follow are given the answers concerning citizenship, the 
treatment of a diploma from a school in a sister State or in a foreign country, and 
admission of practitioners of a sister State or foreign country.

NOTE A. 
In America the university is a corporation, governed by a board of trustees who elect a president 
and appoint professors. There is, in brief, a business body accountable either to the State, to a religious 
or other society, or to no one except it be to a somewhat vague body called the alumni. In France all 
this is different. The State grants diplomas as the United States grants patents, and a French diploma 
has the same value as an American patent, that is to say, it is protected by law. ‘This is the foundation 
of the Université de France. It was the State regulating higher instruction. ‘Thus all that was neces- 
sary was an examining board at convenient places and these were called faculties. But thefaculties soon 
Decame schools and in French terminology a faculty of science and a school of science, for example, are 
perfectly convertible terms. Thus each school in France became a part of the huge machine operated 
from Paris. In 1883 M. Jules Simon, the minister of public instruction, and others began to look for-

ward to the day when the group of schools or faculties in each of the seventeen educational jurisdic- 
tions of France should bo made a university. In 1885 a council of the faculties, of which there are five 
in France— letters, sciences, theology, medicine, and law—was created and by the law of 1896 this body 
was made into the faculty of the university. But the minister of public instruction in France has a 
vice-minister or pretor in each of the seventeen academic jurisdictions of the “ University of France.” 
The officer equally directs the concerns of higher, secondary, and elementary education. Thus we have 
a university with its own faculty managing its own educational concerns, presided over by a rector 
who is the viceroy of the educational minister at Paris for education of every grade and kind. ‘The 
board of business men of the American university at Paris is a bureau; the agent of that bureau in 
the provinces presides in each academy over the university council, and the twelve universities ar> 
universities cach without a head. Upon the request made to the universities by the minister to com- 
municate freely with him, the councils of several laid before him the following as information: is 
“The council of the University of Aix-Marseilles consider it anomalous that bodies which are 
recruited by election should not be allowed to freely choose their head from among their own number. 
All foreign universities clect their president without the central power losing any of its prerogatives 
or suffering in any way. The council of the University of Rennes speaks to the same effect, so also 
the University of Nancy. The University of Montpellier wishes its new head to be called chancellor. 
The University of Lille claims that the rector of the academy represents the business administration 
and the council the deliberating administration of higher education and proposes that the work of the 
council be directed by a president who should be chosen from among the members of that body and who 
would thus represent the university, as the rector would represent tho State. The University of 
Grenoble remarks that the recently created French universities should not be compared with the free 
(private) universities of the United States and England, which are absolutely mistresses of themselves, 
unembarrassed by dependence upon the State, but as the new universities are well defined corporations 
they should each have an individual chief and it is undesirable that he should be the rector of the 
academy. The University of Dijon would retain the rector as president of the university but would 
make him an honorary professor of the faculty.” 
Tt is at once seen how different is the management of a French university and that of an American 
institution. In France it would appear that everything is regulated from Paris, but in America by 
the university, or rather like tho fellows manage the affairs of the colleges and halls of Oxford. Yet 
in France no professor can be appointed by the president of the Republic unless his name heads a 
list gotten up by tho faculty of the University in which the vacancy occurs on one side, and the 
permanent section of higher education on the other. In America the faculty has nothing to do with 
the appointment of professors unless by private solicitation. In America the business board takes 
testimony as to the conditions so that it may act properly; in France the council is already schooled 
in a knowledge of the facts, and is in all educational matters allowed to act for itself, only modified by 
the power of the central government to fix the curriculum and the character of the examinations.

CHAPTER XXVI. 
ESKIMO VOCABULARIES. 
Compiled by Ensign RoGER WELLS, jr., U. 8. N., and Interpreter JoHN W. KELLY. 
INTRODUCTORY NOTE. 
The U.S. S. Thetis was detailed by the Navy Department to cruise, during the 
summer and autumn of 1889, in the Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean, for the purpose of 
looking out for the whaling and commercial interests of the United States in those 
waters, and also for the purpose of assisting in the establishment of a house of 
refuge at Point Barrow, the most northerly point of our territory. 
During this cruise, in order to make it as broad and useful as possible, several of 
the officers on board of the Thetis were directed to prepare reports upon subjects 
connected with the waters and regions visited by the ship, from their observation 
and from other reliable sources. Two reports were submitted to me upon the subject 
of the Eskimos of northwestern Alaska; one on the ethnography of the Eskimos, 
by John W. Kelly, and the other an Eskimo vocabulary, prepared by Ensign Roger 
Wells, jr., almost entirely from information and material furnished by Mr. John W. 
Kelly, the interpreter of the ship. Mr. Kelly spent three winters among the north- 
western Eskimos, and has been engaged for seven years at various times in acquir- 
ing a knowledge of the language. The vocabulary is the largest in number of words 
that I know of treating of the language of the Eskimos upon our Arctic coast. It 
has a short vocabulary of the American Eskimos who are settled upon the Asiatic 
side of Bering Strait, which, I think, will be found particularly interesting and 
valuable. 
The Thetis had the good fortune during this summer of reaching as far east as 
Mackenzie Bay and as far west as Herald Island and Wrangell Land, thus leaving 
an honorable name for service among Arctic cruisers. It is to be hoped that the 
reports, memoranda, and other contributions secured through the ready co-operation 
of the officers of the ship will serve also to make a permanent and useful record of 
the cruise creditable to the ship, interesting to the general reader, and of value as 
contributions to our knowledge of the Territory of Alaska.

ESKIMO VOCABULARIES. 1243 
NOTE ON ESKIMO BIBLIOGRAPHY. 
By SHELDON JACKSON, 
United States General Agent of Education in Alaska. 
A very complete “Bibliography of the Eskimo Language” has been compiled by 
Mr. James C. Pilling, and published by the Bureau of Ethnology, Washington, D, C. 
Whoever examines its pages must be impressed with the large number of persons who 
have unpublished manuscripts, containing from a score to a few hundred words; 
the large number of printed reports of Arctic explorations, which contain a partial 
list of words and phrases; and the fact that there is not a single comprehensive 
English-Eskimo vocabulary in print, and accessible to teachers and others, among 
the Alaskan Eskimos. 
Among the most important in the past are— 
Dr. Benjamin S. Barton’s Vocabulary of the Grecniandets (from Cranz). 8 vo; 
pages, 132, Pub. Philadelphia, 1798. 
Eskimaux and English Vocabulary, compiled by Capt. John Washington, R. N., 
and published by order of the lords commissioners of the admiralty for the use of 
the Artic Expedition in Search of Sir John Franklin. Oblong 12 mo. 160 pages. 
London. 1850. 
English-Aleutian Dictionary prepared by Stephen N. Buynitzky, and published by 
the Alaska Commercial Company. San Francisco, 1871. 8yvo. 13 pp. 
The aboye are out of print. 
The most recent vocabulary that is available is that of Lieut. P. Il. Ray, in the 
Report of the International Polar Expedition to Point Barrow. 4°. Washington, 
D. C., 1885. 
This volume gives 711 words and 307 phrases, as used by the Eskimo at Point 
Barrow. 
Perhaps ‘the most important contribution to the Eskimo language is in process of 
preparation by L. M. Turner, in his observations made in 1882-1881, and will be 
published in connection with the Signal Service of the United States Army. 
It will contain a voeabulary of the Koksoagmyut of over 7,000 words; the Unalit 
of Norton Sound, 3,000 words; the Malimyut, Norton Sound, 250 words; and the 
Unalaska-Alyut Dictionary of 1,900 words.

  CHAPTER XXVII. 
EDUCATIONAL MATTERS OF INTEREST IN VARIOUS 
STATES. 
ARIZONA. 
Report for 1895-96, Hon. T. E. Dalton, superintendent of public instruction. 
The census of children has increased since the year 1895 to 16,936, being 1,027 more 
than in that year. Of this number 76 per cent attended the public schools some 
time during the year. The attendance at private schools added would raise to 82 
percent. The average of actual daily attendance, however, was only 45 per cent, 
a fact which, in the opinion of the superintendent, shows the need of an effective 
compulsory educational law. 
The increase in the number of school districts during the year 1895 was 4, making 
the number now 223. Increase in number of teachers is 3, the whole number now 
being 224. Some reduction in wages has taken place. Duration of school term was 
6.34 months, an increase of about one-third of a month. The number of new school- 
houses built in the biennium is 20. Table of receipts and expenditures is added. 
At one of the meetings of the Territorial board of education (June 20, 1896), among 
the inatructions given to teachers was the following interesting one regarding corporal 
punishment: 
“Any teacher, before inflicting corporal punishment upon a pupil, must first notify 
the parents or guardian and one member of the board of trustees of his or her inten- 
tion at least one day before such punishment is to be inflicted, stating the day and 
hour at which the punishment will be inflicted, and extending an invitation to such 
parent or guardian and one trustee to be present. The punishment must not be 
inflicted in the presence of the school.” 
The report urgently recommends a uniform course of studies in the entire Territory 
The report comments upon the fact that, notwithstanding the severe responsibili- 
ties of the superintendent of public instruction, his position is dependent upon one 
appointing power, which subtracts from its dignity. He contends that, as in other 
States and Territories, he should have control over county superintendents, trustees, 
and teachers, and be allowed an adequate salary. The matter is argued at some 
length. So itis with the provision of the school law which makes the county probate 
judges ex officio county school superintendents, whether or not they have had expe- 
rience in teaching. Recommendation is made of some provision of law whereby the 
standards in grading in county schools by county board examiners may be brought 
at least to some nearer approximation to conformity. The report, indeed, advances 
the opinion that these boards should be abolished and their duties assigned to the 
county superintendent. 
The new law for apportionment of school funds, although liable to some objec- 
tions, has proven to be in the main satisfactory. Some carelessness in the too rapid 
increase in the number of school districts is complained of, as well as the inefficiency 
of the existing compulsory school law which the attorney-general has decided to be 
“inoperative and void.”   
  ARKANSAS, 
Report for 1895-96, Superintendent Junius Jordan. 
While the value of property in general has dwindled, taxes for school purposes 
have been maintained. ‘The work of the county normal schools has served to 
increase greatly competency among teachers and bring about a better system of 
grading. There has been a notable improvement in schoolhouses, apparatus, and 
other school appointments. Appeal is made for greater force in the superintendent’s 
office, because of the increased number and burthen of its duties. Notwithstanding 
the urgent calls from every county in the State in that behalf, the superintendent 
1277  
-P-A-G-E-150
1278 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
was enabled to visit only about one-fourth. Change is earnestly asked in the matter 
of school directors, many of whom are wholly incompetent, some using the office 
mainly for the purpose of putting in favorites, and many of whom neglect even 
the nominal work of making official rules required by law at their hands. It is, 
claimed that present conditions make change from the districts to the town system 
indispensable. 
The report asks for abolition of the office of county examiners and creation of 
that of county superintendent, with liberal salary. If the former is to remain it is 
recommended that it be elective, in order to remove it from the influence of politics, 
candidates being required to stand examination before the State superintendent. 
The country schools, although yet far behind what it is desirable they should 
become, have improved under the influence of the county normal schools. The report 
recommends advance in the programme of all common schools. 
By an act of the general assembly of 1895 a normal school was required to be 
established for every county in the State, to continue in session for one month. This 
has been a notable success. Among many things said by the report upon this sub- 
ject is the following: 
“JT feel authorized in saying that the money appropriated by the normal for the 
two years past has done more good for the public schools of Arkansas than all other 
movements of like nature that have been set on foot. Nor can we afford to stop 
where we are. ‘he two years were experimental years, but the results show such 
gratifying success that I feel it my duty to urge on the legislature a continuation of 
the appropriation for two years more. At the end of that time the State will be able 
and the necessity apparent for the establishment of one or two permanent normals.” 
The reports of county examiners, in the opinion of the superintendent, show more 
and more the inefficiency of the system of directors, 
The money received from the Peabody fund, which was $2,750 in 1893 and im 1894 
$3,300, has been ‘utilized in normal work, supplementing the State appropriation in 
those counties when the attendance was so large and important as to require one or 
more teachers and in extending, in some instances, the session of one month allowed 
by the State to five or six weeks, as the case demanded.” Normal schools were held 
for three months in five towns—Jonesboro, Prescott, Hope, Normal, and Forest City, 
the last two of negro faculties. 
The question of uniformity of text-books which prevails in some States is discussed 
at some length, the superintendent’s views being adverse to it beyond the schools 
that are under the control of their own special boards of control. In view of the 
great differences in teachers as to culture, habits of thought, and methods of teaching, 
it would seem impracticable to attempt to carry it throughout the State. 
On the whole, what has been done in the matter of education in the State since the 
beginning of the public system is to be highly commended and is auspicious of happy 
consequences. It requires much time for a people, however unembarrassed by 
public, social, domestic, and individual constraints, to become familiar with a policy 
of great universal importance which has been newly introduced into their life. Such 
familiarity was necessarily prolonged during the throes of political reconstruction 
after a disastrous war and the financial struggles, which ever since its passing have 
been continuous. It is most noteworthy that the people have cheerfully submitted 
to the taxation necessary for the prosecution of a purpose whose value has year after 
year been more clearly recognized.

GREAT PUBLIC LIBRARIES IN THE UNITED STATES. 
By Epwarp 8. HoLpen.! 
The present decade has witnessed the foundation of several great libraries and the 
reorganization of others. The movement has not come too soon. Library organiza- 
tion in tho United States has been studied with success, and we have a school of 
librarians whose intelligence and fitness is beyond praise. By their congresses and 
by their printed papers the main principles, and more especially tho details, of their 
work have received a thorough examination. It might seem that there was little 
left to be said on matters of organization and policy. But a great library has to 
meet the wants of a very varied constituency, and it may not be impertinent for one 
of the outsiders and tax payers to present a few considerations, from the non- 
technical point of view, which relate rather to principles than to details. Irecollect 
a sight-seer at the Naval Observatory of Washington who asked to be furnished 
with a volume which had cost the Government $8 to print. He was highly indig- 
nant when his request was denied. He was a tax payer, he said, and demanded

the volume as his right. Admiral Rodgers made a short calculation on his blotting 
pad and came to the conclusion that, as one of 50,000,000, his visitor’s share was less 
than 5 cents, and thereupon tendered that coin in payment. There are 75,000,000 
of us now, and the share of each is small. But each one has a right to be heard at 
least. 
The 75,000,000 people do not all want nor need the same thing. There aro 
14,000,000 school children, for instance, with special needs. It is vital to our 
continuance as a nation that they shall be taught to comprehend the fundamental 
principle of all government—liberty with order—but it is not necessary, nor prac- 
ticable, nor desirable, that they should all be instructed in the higher walks of 
literature or science. The gates are open to all; but only a few will enter—can 
enter. x 
The school child absorbs. He does not add to knowledge, though he may do so. 
This chance must be kept in mind and he must he considered as a possible creator. 
The first duty of some libraries is to reach everybody in the community, beginning 
with the lowest minds and going as high as may be. This is precisely in keeping 
with American ideas at present, and the duty is not likely to be forgotten. The 
scores of libraries (of which the Boston Public Library, with its 575,000 volumes, is 
perhaps the best known type) that provide every possible convenience for their 
constituents make it certain that the library will soon be brought to every door. 
The humblest has only to ask. The college library regards the wants of a different 
class, and, in general, provides for them admirably. ‘Tho libraries of Harvard . 
(474,000 volumes), Chicago (280,000), Yale (215,000), Columbia (160,000), are excellent . 
examples. A large and increasing proportion of the men who are to shape the fate 
of the Republic in the next century will be furnished by the colleges. Fine 
scholarship, balanced character, originality, open and flexible intelligence, directive 
power, are fostered in academic shades. Enlightened public opinion is essential in 
the Republic. This will always be formed by ideas originated by a very small 
number of thinkers and subsequently adopted by millions of citizens. It is indes- 
pensable to educate the whole mass of voters intelligently to select and receive their 
standards of action, but it is vital to encourage by every practicable means the 
creation of such standards by the comparatively few. 
In every great city—Washington, New York, Chicago, San Francisco—at least 
one great library should be maintained whose first duty is to meet the wants of the 
very highest class of students, and to create and foster insight and distinction of 
character. Just as we maintain the public school as a great conservative force—a 
reservoir of intelligent citizens—so we should, in a proper proportion, cherish all 
influences which tend to the production of the very highest type. And a great 
library is a mighty influence of this sort. It is taken for granted in this place that 
both ideals can not be perfectly subserved by a single organization; that it is funda- 
mental to determine at the outset what the ideal is to be; whether to begin at the 
highest and work down, or at the bottom and work upward. If the assumption is 
doubted, I ask any teacher of experience to say whether it is or is not essential to 
grade our children in the public schools into classes of like accomplishments; 
whether it is not advantageous to dissociate the older from the younger students in 
college; whother a mixture of very different elements is not likely to degrade the 
higher proportionally more than it will raise the lower; whether learning has not 
a more intense spirit in the upper levels. The readers ina library are, of course, 
not brought into close association like the students of aschool. But it is of the 
highest importance which ideal is held up by the fundamental organization. An 
example will illustrate this. It has been proposed, first, to make the National 
Library at Washington strictly a library of reference—primarily for scholars; and 
second, to make it a lending library for Congress and for city readers. Is it indif- 
ferent which plan is adopted? Will the library be the samo institution a century 
hence in the two cases? Will it have had the same effect upon the life of the 
country? It is a matter that can be debated which of the two plans is better. The 
present point is that they will lead to very different results in the end, and that the 
right plan must be chosen at the outset. 
‘The main argument of this paper is that there is pressing need for influences 
which will create and preserve the highest scholarship and culture, and a prospec- 
tive danger unless our coming leaders are trained; that it is not sufficient to train 
the followers; and finaily, that a few libraries, one in each great city, should be 
organized in the interest of scholars, primarily, sacrificing whatever must be sacri- 
ficed to attain this end. One of the strangest phenomena of our democracy is its 
rage for uniformity and conformity. Variety, originality, and independence must 
be deliberatoly fostered, as well as prized. The effect in this regard of the old Astor 
Library in New York, with its dignified hospitality to serious students—making 
their higher interests its own—has been simply incalculable. Taking a single 
instance, it is impossible for me to remember without gratitude the weeks I spent as 
a lad, a generation ago, in its alcoves where the whole resources of its magnificent .

collections were freely opened. I had been introduced as a student, and no further 
recommendation was needed. Notlong since I had occasion to make a short research 
ina large library in the East conducted in a different spirit. There were telephones, 
branches, a microscopic shelf classification, pneumatic deliveries, and everything 
“modern.” The reader was taken charge of, and every part of the ‘‘ business” was 
done like the manual of arms, but finally it was business and not scholarship. It 
was a surprise to escape from the automatic mill without a pink ticket containing 
an abstract (by the library assistant) of the books I had consulted. -In its way it 
was all admirable, but the high spirit was absent. Of course ‘‘ business methods” 
are essential and these were intended to encourage, not to deter. The only just criti- 
cisi is that the assistant (and the reader) was obsessed by them. This result need not 
follow, but it points to a danger in the ‘“‘newest” methods; which is to fail to see 
the forest by virtue of looking too intently at the trees. The difference in these 
two libraries arose simply from a difference in ideal—in fundamental plan. 
Under its new direction the Astor Library, one of the constituent parts of the 
New York Public Library (which comprises the Astor, Tilden, and Lenox founda- 
tions), is still to be faithful to its old traditions. Its relations to scholars willremain 
as before, and it will leave to other departments of the public library the care for 
the general interest. If the argument of this paper is correct it will be necessary 
to draw the lines of demarcation sharply. These problems have hardly yet arisen 
on the Pacific coast, but they will arise, for they are fundamental. The direction-of 
our future development will depend in no unimportant degree on the solution that 
we adopt in the Sutro Library and other great foundations of the sort. 
There is a widespread fallacy with regard to the use of libraries which is ‘mod- 
ern,” and all the more dangerous because it is partly true. It is assumed that any 
and every library is doing its best service whenits books have the maximum 
circulation, 
Elaborate statistical tables are printed to show how many volumes have been 
drawn this year as against last year, ete. The more drawn, the more fully is the 
library performing its function. This is not always so. Take the special case of a 
public-school library, forexample. Is it better for the community that a high-school 
Jad should read a dozen volumes of Jules Verne’s in a six-month, or that he should 
spend the same time over a single volume of Plutarch or Froissart? The statistical 
tables try to cover such cases by dividing the books issued into classes (history, fic- 
tion, philosophy, etc.). But even here the point is missed. ‘The usefulness of the 
library depends solely on the benefit the readers derive from the books they draw. 
This may well be greater when few books are drawn than when twice the number 
are issued. Reading is no virtue in itself; and if it were, the value of reading is 
certainly not proportional to the number of pages read. ‘The trivial attitude of 
mind which is fostered by the multitude and cheapness of modern newspapers, mag- 
azines, and books has impressed everyone. A trivial-minded child makes a trivial- 
minded citizen. The library must not measure its usefulness by the multitude of its 
issues. All these points are obvious enough-—even trite—but a caution against such 
fallacies, bolstered by statistics, may not be wasted. Many librarians, and more 
boards of trustees, are still disposed to accept mere movement for advance. 
Another popular fallacy relates to the kind of knowledge which makes a compe- 
tent librarian. Roughly speaking, he is supposed to know everything. The last 
man who knew everything was Dante. Since his time all living scholarshave had to 
specialize. They should rae at least one thing supremely well, which will insure 
their power to learn other things for themselves, and their ability to put students in 
general on any desired track. It is nothing short of absurd to expect a scholar 
to-day—either in science or literatwre—to be a master in more than one or two 
departments. All that can be asked is a thorough knowledge of one part, a thorough 
acquaintance with its relation to other parts, and a minute familiarity with the 
bibliographic aids by which books are sifted and compelled to yield what they con- 
tain, the whole of this informed with the scholar’s enthusiasm, method, and desire 
tocommunicate. Living among books gives an astonishing acquaintance with small 
details which may serve to impress the inquirer or the library trustee; but caring 
for them and using them gives the spirit of research which is the sole important 
matter. 
Itis not a little remarkable that so few of our librarians are themselves authors. 
It would seem, as the materials for authorship lie all about them, and as their atten- 
tion is daily called to books which are needed and not yet written, that they would 
be inwardly compelled to supply the lacks they see. The explanation of this aridity 
of a learned profession in the United States (it is not so in foreign countries) is that 
our librarians are overworked. They tend to become, not scholars, but clerks of 
high degree. If this is a correct explanation of anu undoubted fact the matter calls 
for a remedy. 
A library is an immense cyclopedia of all knowledge. The librarians should be. 
specialists, and if they have proper support will become authors. The last edition 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
  CALIFORNIA. 128t 
of the Encyclopedia Britannica contains contributions from nineteen scholars of the 
staff of the British Museum on the widest range of subjects. This is precisely as it 
should be. Our own National Library in Washington should be reorganized with 
such a staff of specialists, each presiding over his own department. Every impor- 
tant book in each department of knowledge will be recommended for purchase by a 
competent judge. The bibliography of each special subject can be kept up to date. 
The whereabouts of rare books which the National Library does not own will be 
known. Nosuch book can be offered for sale without the knowledge of the Librarian. 
Questions from any citizen in the whole country on any conceivable subject can be 
referred to the persons best qualified to reply to them, or at least to set the inquirer 
on the proper track. Such an organization as this can serve the whole country, not 
anerely a group of citizens, and will make the library veritably national, not simply 
ocal, 
“A great library, to be ideally complete, should contain every book that may be 
called for by any student. But practically there is no such collection on earth, nor 
will there ever be. A library must content itself with the possible, and use its 
resources in seeking after the most useful. This principle has an immediate applica- 
tion and a very striking one in the case of the National Library at Washington, 
which has just moved into its splendid home. If any collection in the country 
should be complete this should be. But all around it are the special libraries of the 
different Government Departments, each one of which has been most carefully sup- 
plied with the very best special books, chosen by experts. There are more than a 
score of such Department libraries in Washington (Light-House Bureau, Surgeon- 
General’s Office, Patent Office, etc.), and they contain in the aggregate nearly 400,000 
volumes (many duplicates). It seems clear that what is required is not a reduplica- 
tion of such volumes in the National Library, but rather a complete catalogue of 
these 400,000 departmental books always on hand in the central library. The mak- 
ing of such a catalogue might well be undertaken by the National Library for its 
own use, and its buying of new books controlled by the knowledge that such a cat- 
alogue would give. Every book that can be obtained should be available in the 
capital, but of two books not in the National Library that one should be purchased 
which is not to be found in one of the Departments. This very simple policy can 
not be carried out until such a catalogue as is described has been made, and the time 
is ripe to provide it. One of these Department libraries—that of the Surgeon-General’s Office (104,000)— 
has taken the problem into its own hands and carried it to the extreme limit of 
perfection. Under the leadership of Dr. Billings the library has been treated as if 
it were a vast book—a single work—and indexed as such, page by page. The sub- 
ject index is printed in 16 large quartos. Such an elaborate index is a magnificent. 
contribution to pure science, but it is not needed in most cases. A simple list of the 
books would be sufficient. We have aright to expect bibliographic contributions of 
the sort from the staffs of the great libraries of the country. Though much has 
been done the lacks are very far from being supplied. 
Just as special libraries, like those of the Washington Departments, are of 
immense value when they surround the general collection, so it is important that the 
general librarian should be himself surrounded by specialists. This necessity is 
recognized abroad, as has been said. Atthe British Museum or in the national libra- 
ries of Berlin and Paris an inquirer can have, at the shortest notice, an expert 
opinion on a point in numismatics, Arabian history, art, science, medizwval meta- 
physics, the economics of the Roman Empire, or last year’s movement of commerce 
in the Manchester ship canal. Where can we point in America to such a staff? 
Our scholars are dispersed throughout the faculties of our colleges. There is no 
central institution of the sort; nor are our library stafis org ed so as to attract 
specialists. Many scholars are indeed to be found in our libraries, but they are 
generally overworked and underpaid. Our tendency has been to use the library 
income in perfecting the details of a system, and to proportionately neglect the one 
important matter, which is to encourage scholarship. 
In the matter of copyright books a small change in our system—one often pro- 
posed—would produce a great benefit. At present the Government gives its protec- 
tion to authors in return for two copies of each work printed. Both of these copies 
are deposited in the National Library. In England five copies are called for, which 
are placed in five different libraries (London, Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Dub- 
lin). Ifthe United States required three copies instead of two (not a very heavy 
tax when we consider what is given in return), one of these might be deposited in 
Washington, one in Chicago, one in San Francisco, with manifest advantage to the 
author, to learning, and to the public. It would be thereafter certain that the risks 
of fire and public enemies would not endanger all three examples of a printed book. 
The present system makes everything depend on asingle repository. We shall soon 
be in a position to defy public enemies at the national capital: but the risk of fire 
and accident always remains.

  1282 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Whether, and how far, the great library should extend its scope to include great 
collections of paintings and the like is a question too large to be considered here. 
It is not a little remarkable that we have in the country, as yet, no systematic and 
orderly collection of fine copies of the great paintings of the world. The originals 
we cannot have. The Nevada millionaire found to his surprise that it was impos- 
sible to compete in this respect with ‘those kings.” Fine and faithful covies we 
can have, and at no extravagant expense. Such a collection intelligently made 
would be an immense educator and a source of permanent pleasure. The other 
extremity of policy should be considered also, namely, the direct encouragement of 
originality in our own artists, rather than the education of their pupils and of the 
public. The artist-popes of Italy—Raphael’s and Angelo’s popes—were perpetually 
seeking new works; and thus perpetually contriving new opportunities. Room was 
made for Raphael’s frescos by sweeping away those of Perugino and Cortona. Wall, 
space to spare there must be in all great buildings. Let the architect provide suit- 
able light, and perhaps the pictures may be forthcoming, either by private gift or 
by public appropriation. To pass through a hall of noble statues is no bad intro- 
duction to a working day among great books. 
‘There are many other points of interest and of prime importance which suggest 
themselves in connection with the era of library reorganization which has now set 
in all over the country. Perhaps the foregoing are the chief ones. If we are to be 
blessed with many great libraries in this country let us resolutely devote a few of 
them to the interest of the scholar and of the specialist, making this our first con- 
cern, and being willing to sacrifice all lesser interests. It isto them that we must 
look for the creation of new ideas, of new plans, of new applications of old concep- 
tions. So far as it is practicable to provide for the interests of those who absorb 
knowledge, and of those who create it, by a single plan, this should be done. The 
fundamental matter is to realize that both ideals can not be followed in all cases, 
and to make up our minds that the interests of the scholar shall bo safeguarded in 
at least a few of the greater establishments. We may safely leave to the smaller 
ones their no less important duty. 
CALIFORNIA SCHOOL REPORT. 
Report for 1895 and 1896, Hon. Samuel T, Black, superintendent of public instruction. 
The report declares that within the last five years has been a greatly enhanced 
interest in education throughout the State. A notable impulse was given by the 
establishment of the Leland Stanford University. The number of students there 
and in the State University is more than four times that formerly in the latter. ‘To 
each has been attached a department of pedagogy, to which a far larger number of 
students than was expected resorts. 
The schools enumerated in the public system are primary and grammar schools, 
evening schools, normal schools, and technical schools as may be established by the 
legislature, or by municipal or district authority. The report says: ‘Evening 
schools have been established in nearly all the cities of the State, and are doing a 
noble work. While little has been done in the way of technical schools proper, 
departments of manual training have been established in many of our cities and 
larger towns. ‘Two of the normal schools are provided with manual training depart- 
ments and are doing good work.” 
High schools have been raised to the dignity that their students, having completed 
the course, are prepared to enter the university. 
The normal schools, being designed purely for the education of teachers, aremainly 
technical. Graduates from grammar schools being admissible therein, the academic 
studies necessary to be further pursued havo led to fixing the course at four years. 
If the law were such that high-school preparation were required for admission into 
the normal schools, the course in the latter might safely be reduced to two years. 
By this means they, as they ought, might be made professional schools, as are those 
in other professions. To this end thoughtful minds generally are striving. Somo 
quite pointed observations are quoted from the report of the committee of fifteen. 
One of the paragraphs is here inserted: 
“It is a widely prevalent doctrine, to which the customs of our best schools con- 
form, that teachers of elementary schools should have a secondary or high-school 
education, and that teachers of high schools should have a college education. Your 
committes believe that these are the minimum acquirements that can generally be 
accepted; that the scholarship, erlture, and power gained by four years of study in 
advance of the pupils are not too much to be rightfully demanded; and that, asa 
rule, no one ought to become a teacher who has not the age and attainments pre- 
supposed in tho possession of a high-school diploma. There are differences in high 
schools, it is true, and a hign-school diploma is not a fixed standard of attainment, 
but in these United States it is one of the most definite and uniform standards that
-P-A-G-E-155
  COLORADO. 1283 
we possess, and varies less than college degrees vary or than elementary and local 
standards of culture vary.” 
Yet the committee maintain that high-school graduation must be of unexception- 
able reputation and completeness, else applicants be subjected to close examination, 
Considering that the high schools get no aid from the State, it seems surprising 
the number that have been established by private initiative. At the writing of this 
report there were as many as 98, with 381 teachers, whose average salary was over 
$1,000. ‘Their buildings are not far from $2,000,000 in cost. The average of daily 
attendance is 78 per cent of the number enrolled, thus being in excess of that in the 
elementary schools, which is 71 percent. This liberal support voluntarily extended 
augurs strongly that this secondary system will in good time receive from the State 
the aid which has been plainly shown to be merited. The university has shown 
appreciation of their importance, as seen by the following language in this report: 
“The State University has adopted a system of accrediting high schools, whereby, 
on account of the high order of work done, their graduates will he admitted to the 
university, on the recommendation of the principal, without examination. During 
the last year as many as 67 were thus complimented. In the list, however, were 
several private academies.” 
Besides the three normal schools supported by the State, there is one which is fos- 
tered by the city of San Francisco. The course is one year, in which only the theory 
and art of teaching are taught. 
Although there was not time to visit the various orphan asylums of the State, 
those which were visited showed good, humane management. 
The normal schools from time to time have raised the standard of admission, and 
gratifying increase of applications come not only from high schools but even from 
those holding only primary and grammar graded certificates, These institutions, 
besides their set curricula, are doing much of what the report styles ‘‘seminary 
work” among teachers, through teachers’ circulars and other agencies. 
COLORADO. 
Report for 1895-96, Mrs. A. J. Peavey, superintendent of public instruction. 
Mrs. Peavey begins with candidly admitting that the system of public schools 
suffers from serious defects. 
“Tho laws have been changed from time to time, and lack not only harmony but 
are confusing and difficult of interpretation, and should be thoroughly revised. The 
rights of superintendents are circumscribed, and those of the school directors are 
too unrestricted.” 
Yet it is said that improvement has gone along the educational lines, especially 
in what tho superintendent calls ‘‘ethical culture.” Quite a number of voluntary 
Gi ons havo been formed, including parents, with teachers and other cfficials. 
se have resulted in creating considerable inspiration in several localities. 
A serious movement has been contemplated for some time to modify the office of 
directors. It was recommended that the school system have two departments of 
administration, one for supervising instruction and the other for managing the 
business. The report says that this change is very much needed in the State. 
“With all deference to the faithful and consecrated ones, in many instances the 
school fund is being wantonly and unrighteously wasted; men and women who have 
made a failure of their own lives and enterprises are to-day occupying these posi- 
tions, and they are not only engendering factional differences, but are evading the 
law in every possible way in order to loot the treasury and rob the children of their 
rights. . . . Letthe directors give our schools the same permanent equipment 
as is given to all other professions, unvexed by the murky minds of politics, the 
unrighteousness of favoritism, or the fear of sectionalism. . . . The standard of 
teaching would be elevated just as soon as it was understood that a man or woman 
was to be employed, not to pay a political debt, but to servo the public; not to 
oceupy a certain position and draw so much pay a month, but to find it, and earn by 
honest work the money that is paid out.” 
In general tho superintendents are reported as doing honest work; but there are 
afew exceptions in those who have been devoted mainly to furthering political 
schemes. 
A notable change has lately taken place in the make-up of superintendents, of whom 
women have increased during the present administration from one to twenty-six; and 
the new appointees, it is declared, have done faithful, efficient work. 
There has been considerable improvement in schoolhouses. 
It is recommended that all instructors and directors applying to teach in normal 
institutes, of which there are thirteen in the State, should have testimonials of fit- 
ness from the State board of examiners. Ten of these institutes were held during 
the year 1896, with notably good results. 
       
-P-A-G-E-156
  1284 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Compulsory education has been much more effectually enforced. The falling off in 
Arapahoe County has been far less, being only 44 per cent of those in attendance 
upon public schools. This would be diminished considerably: further if that in 
private schools were counted. 
The State board of examiners held nine sessions. The conditions of getting 
diplomas are very stringent, and they are gradually raising the standard of the 
teaching force. 
A very large number of decisions are printed in the report, that were given by the 
superintendent upon questions submitted by her subordinates upon several subjects. 
Among those seeming particularly noteworthy is the following touching use of the 
Bible in schools: 
“Neither the constitution of the State nor the statutes touch directly the reading 
of the Bible or prayer, or any other form of religious or devotional exercises, except 
to forbid that observance or participation shall be compulsory. The spirit of the 
constitution permits religious exercises in school if nothing sectarian is introduced 
and the trustees do not object.” 
DENVER SCHOOL REPORT, 
Report for 1896; Aaron Gove, superintendent. 
The report dwells at some length on the various studies in the school course, as 
German, music, physical culture, and drawing. The department of sloyd was intro- 
duced six months ago, and has been studied by quite a number of pupils in the 
eighth, seventh, and part of the sixth grade. 
Kindergartens have become notable favorites, their number having been doubled 
during the year. The superintendent, under instruction of the board, opened 20. 
Much attention has been paid to cooking and sewing. 
It is a boast of the superintendent that school funds are the more easily raised and 
bear less heavily upon the people because of the fact that there are no outstanding 
bonds of the city on which interest is to be paid. 
On the subject of clubs among students of the high school, the principal, Prof. 
William H. Smily, has to say the following: 
“With the exception of the lyceum and attic society, the cadets, and the athletic 
associations, the school gives no countenance to societies, but invites the coopera- 
tion of the home in checking the formation of small clubs and the holding of 
socials,” 
The report discusses, under the head The Public Library, the question of the quan- 
tity of books on fiction it is proper to have there. The decision is to cut down 
gradually the present list until it includes only what is “distinctively standard.” 
Appended is the charter for the support and regulation of the schools of Denver, 
approved February 13, 1874, as amended February 2, 1876. It appéars to be a care- 
fully prepared paper and intended to provide for all contingencies in school life. 
Among them we note the following salutary provision: 
“62. Any child coming to school without proper attention having been given the 
cleanliness of his person or dress, and whose clothes need repairing, shall be sent 
home to be properly prepared for the schoolroom.” And this: 
“63. Text-books are furnished to pupils by the board; but books can not be taken 
from the school building except by special permission of the principal.” 
Teaehers’ certificates are valid during only one year after their issuance. The 
following serves to show that extreme care is taken in the matter of obtaining and 
retaining teachers: 
“The teachers are elected by the board of education, but first must be present at 
an examination and receive a legal certificate to teach. The examination is both 
oral and written, occupies three days, and embraces reading, spelling, English 
grammar, physical and descriptive geography, arithmetic, elements of algebra, 
United States history, English literature, elements of vocal music, methods and 
theory of teaching and drawing.” 
Those in kindergartens, besides these, must hold State certificates for kindergar- 
tens, issued only by the constituted kindergarten authorities. 
  CONNECTICUT. 
Report for 1895 and 1896, from the State board of education to the governor, and from the secretary, Hon. Charles D. Hine, to the board: 
Attention is directed first to the law forbidding child labor in factories, passed in 
1886, amended by that of 1887, by which appointed agents could compel school 
attendance. These agents are reported to have done their work with diligence and 
with excellent results. In this respect the last year, 1896, was notable. Increase in
-P-A-G-E-157
  CONNECTICUT. 1285 
attendance within the five years last past has gone beyond increase in enumeration, 
notwithstanding quite a number of withdrawals to private schools. Not that the 
evil has been entirely abated ; for, despite all attempts thereto, it yet exists to an 
unhappy extent, and is regarded as the very greatest impediment to educational 
success. 
Serious complaint is made of the incertitude and partial inefficiency of the rules 
regarding teachers’ examinations. On this head the report thus speaks : 
“The object of these examinations is to secure trustworthy evidence of fitness to 
teach. While there is a law requiring local examinations, these examinations do 
not raise the standard of teaching, nor keep out the inefficient and untrained. 
Whether disregarded willfully or negligently, the administration of the law relating 
to examinations is lax, and is an open door to the unqualified and disqualified.” 
To the law of 1888 establishing evening schools, an amendment was subjoined in 
1893, enjoining the board of education to compel attendance of the illiterate between 
14 and 16, and although considerable good has been achieved, yet inspection of fac- 
tories shows that a considerable number of these unfortunates avoid the search of 
those charged especially with the care of their cases. 
The State has three normal schools, with capacity for 700 students. 
The report calls special attention, which it urges at considerable length, to an 
extended report of the secretary on the subject of high schools. Among the influ- 
ences supposed to be operating to their hurt are the colleges. We give an extract 
from the discussion of this point : 
“Only about one in fifteen of those who enter the high schools of this State after- 
wards go to college. If any of the fourteen are badly educated, the fact is not 
demonstrated through any accepted test. If, however, the one who takes the college 
examination does not pass this examination, his school is thought to be tried and 
found wanting. It is therefore natural that the best teachers should be set by the 
principals to teach the small college classes. This, of itself, would be bearable. 
‘The existing evils result largely from the fault that college examinations are adopted 
to test the amount of memorizing that has been done, rather than the intellectual 
power that has been acquired. The college classes have to be got ready for an 
examination—not educated. They can best be prepared, as things now are, by 
securing the memorizing of lessons through the tests of the oral recitation, and by 
a skillful mechanical drill. We can not justly criticise the purposes or methods of 
those who are engaged in preparing boys and girls for college. Their work is laid 
out for them by the college authorities. It is, however, unfortunate that most high 
school principals and most of the best teachers should be, perforce, accustomed to 
narrow ideas of education. From this it results that the thousands of scholars who 
are not going to college are also set to memorizing lessons instead of being wisely 
educated.” This question, referring the while to the overmuch time spent with Latin 
and Greek (which, in the board’s opinion, ought not to be taught to those who are 
not to go to college) is elaborately discussed. The report of the secretary in general 
appeals for a more modern and workable system of education, for better preparation 
for teaching, and for extension of higher education to all the children. 
A table is added giving reports of the agents to whom is intrusted the duty of 
enforcing the law appertaining to child labor. A part of its violation is due to manu- 
facturers who employ children within the law’s provision, relying for protection upon 
parents’ certificates. To remedy this, one of the agents recommends that certificates 
of age, instead of coming from parents, should be gotten from the bureau of vital 
statistics in the counties and towns where they were born. 
There are some interesting things in the reports made to the secretary by the 
teachers. One of them speaks of what he regards serious evils. Among other things 
he says : 
“The foregoing statistics suggest : 
“J, The inadequate pay to many teachers, 
2, The great ditference between the wages of women and men ($42 to $84). 
“3. The great number of persons allowed to begin without preparation—a mon- 
strous abuse of children. . . . Half of the teachers in the State do not receive 
more than $8 per week, or $288 a year. Out of this grows a crop of evils. The weil 
qualified are justly uneasy, and seek better pay and permanent tenure. The poorer 
districts are depleted for the benefit of the richer, and the children bear the burden 
of incompetency and change.” 
The State still holds to the twofold system of school administration. ‘One, the 
original town system, is distinguished,” says the report, “by a single board of officers, 
and a direct, efficient, and reasonable method of doing business. The other, the 
district system, is distinguished by two independent sets of officers, the one hiring 
and paying teachers and caring for schoolhouses, and the other examining teachers 
and supervising the schools,”

  1286 EDUCATION REPORT, 1895-97. 
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 
Report for 1895-96, Hon. J. W. Whelpley, president of the board of trustees. 
The attendance both at day schools and night schools has increased over the last 
year, due, perhaps to some degree, to the system of providing free text-books. Itis 
surprising, the board contends, that with appropriations hardly adequate, so much 
of good work has been done in education. ‘They earnestly maintain that the aver- 
age salaries of teachers are too low, being sensibly below those paid in most of the 
other cities. They reiterate the appeal for an assistant superintendent and fora 
conveyance for the distribution of text-books and other supplies to the various 
schools. Notwithstanding the recent construction of new buildings the schools are 
yet overcrowded, and many pupils are limited to half-day’s tuition. Especial need 
in this respect is for the manual training schools. 
Attention of the Commissioners to kindergartens is again besought. Observation 
has satisfactorily established their utility in preparing very young children for the 
primary schools, 
They also request of Congress a more effective law than those now existing for 
compulsory attendance at school, and they earnestly represent the need of a general 
system of frequent medical inspection. Not alone the capacity of children in regard 
to hearing and seeing, and the means of correcting individual safety should bo 
inquired into, but their seats, desks, supplies of light, study rooms, cloak rooms, 
play grounds, with unceasing watchfulness for appearance of serious contagious 
diseases. 
The report of the superintendent, Hon. W. B. Powell, shows a considerable increase 
in enrollment of pupils, and he gives elaborate statistics of all subjects under his 
supervision. He urgently repeats the request for a delivery wagon and man for 
conveyance of books and general school supplies, a matter which has grown too 
large to avoid giving much inconvenience to the present force of employees. Sani- 
tary considerations in connection with these supplies seem to become more and more 
important with the accumulation of worn-out books. The superintendent, after 
much observation in this regard, expresses the opinion that “‘the only consistent 
system or rule of furnishing books is to give the child the book, when he enters 
school, to hold him responsible until it is worn out, but to let no other person use it. 
‘The plan would be in the interest of cleanliness and good health, and therefore to 
be commended aside from considerations of contagion. 
The superintendent with much earnestness repeats the crying need of more build- 
ings to remoye the unhappy pressure into half-day schools, of which there are more 
than 250 in the city. 
‘The work in the normal school is much commended, and promises yet better results 
to come from the extension of the course from one to two years, which will go into 
operation the coming year. He argues that the board of education should restrict 
the work done in this schocl to learning more definitely what, and how intelligently 
to teach what is known as the common school branches. 
In regard to sanitation the superintendent, regarding it of increasingly exigent 
importance, suggests to the Commissioners to apply to Congress for a medical com- 
mission, cieaet to examine at frequent brief intervals the sanitary condition of 
all school buildings, and at stated intervals to examine pupils and direct teachers 
in the disposition of cases of sickness or other physical infirmities. 
It is claimed that advance has been made in the attempts to give a greater amount 
of individual teaching. Experimentation has led to more intelligent groupings of 
those pupils of sim capacity, development, and receptivity. 
Tho report of Superintendent Cook, of the colored schools, contains some interest- 
ing matter. The habit of corporal punishment, although not get entirely dispensed 
with, is gradually becoming extinct, suspension and other things being substituted. 
Similar opinions with the rest are held by him about kindergartens, and the need 
of more school accommodation. The high school, among others, has outgrown the 
enrollment of its pupils. 
All the reports furnish detailed statements of all items composing the educational 
endeavors of the District. It is gratifying to note the ellent repute in which tho 
teachers are held. High praise of their culture, disciplinary capacity, and fidelity 
is generously bestowed by those whose office is to inspect their work. 
    
  
    FLORIDA. 
Report for 1896, Hon. W. N. Sheats, superintendent. 
Much apprehension was felt for the schools as well as for all other business enter- 
prises in the State by the appalling ster wrought by the memorable freezes in 
the State, the first in December, 1894, and the last on February 8, 1895. The mag- 
 
-P-A-G-E-159

nitudo of that disaster people outside have perhaps never justly conceived. The 
report says of it several things, of which the following is a portion: 
‘Those living outside of the State and not engaged in the cultivation of tropical 
fruits and vegetables have but slight appreciation of what is meant by a ‘freeze,’ 
which impoverishes the rich and takes away the visible means of subsistence from 
tens of thousands of industrious citizens in one night. Groves which had given 
employment to thousands of laborers, yielded large incomes, had required many 
years and much capital to grow, were worth the bare land the next morning. The 
effect upon the State was the same as if every manufactory in New England without 
insurance had been burned to the ground in one night.” 
In view of the universal distress the county commissioners, by request of the 
governor and the executive council, withheld collection of taxes until the fall of 
the year. Yet the public schools had won so much favor from the people that reduc- 
tion of the school tax was not made. Indeed this could not have been done, because 
assessment for education had been made mandatory by the constitution. The result 
was that beyond some lowering of salaries, shortening of terms, and delay in estab- 
lishing schools which were expected to be started, educational interests underwent 
little suffering. 
The rebuke of the delay and negligence of county school officials administered in 
the foregoing report seems to have had intended good results, as the showings made 
by them are in the main satisfactory in the matter of clearness and accuracy. 
The statistics show a very slight falling off of the several items since the freeze. 
With the exception of the year 1895 there has been a constant increase in the num- 
ber of pupils enrolled and in daily attendance. The decrease in the number of 
teachers has been mainly among those of lower grades and by the union of some 
small schools, in which better if fewer teachers were employed. 
Counting the whites alone in the enrollment, it is claimed that the percentage of 
school population is greater than the average for all the United States, greater than 
the New England, and only a little lower than the North Central, and it is a grati- 
fying fact that, whenever enrolled, white children and colored attend with like 
punctuality. In this respect Florida, it is claimed, leads every Southern State, as 
it does in the number of school days. 
There is great difference among the counties in the length of the school term, the 
longest for both races being 157 and the shortest 72 days, 8 below the number 
required by law. The disparity is peculiar to neither race, in several counties the 
colored schools being in this respect ahead of the white. It is suggested that the 
maximum limit of the school levy should be abolished, and it is asserted with 
confidence that such action would be ratified by the people. 
The law passed, in accordance with the recommendation of the superintendent, 
for the uniform examination of teachers met at first with much opposition and from 
sources whence it was expected, a class on whom the report pours some ridicule, and it 
congratulates that such opposition has subsided almost entirely before the evident 
benefits resulting from its operation. In the matter of framing questions for such 
examinations the superintendent, in view of the delicacy and other things attend- 
ing them, asks for the appointment of a commission of two or more special experts 
to perform the work, arguing that the small cost incurred would be far remunerated 
by the value of the service rendered, part of which would be prevention of the 
jealousies on the part of such as for political or other special reasons seek the 
position and indulge in unreasonable complainings when disappointed in that 
behalf. 
It is noteworthy that whereas it is made by the State constitution optional among 
the counties to levy a school tax anywhere between 3 and 5 mills, the number is 
constantly increasing of those which come up to the maximum. Even after the great 
freeze thero was falling off in only two counties. Every one of them, with exception 
of three, levies at least 4 mills, ahd not one went as low as the minimum. 
It is claimed by the report that with the exception of Texas the average of 
teachers’ salaries is above that in any other Southern State. 
Regarding that delicate, difficult problem, the education of the colored race, we 
give the following oxtract: 
“The race is receiving all the educational advantages they are capable of appre- 
ciating. Their schools are as closely supervised as any others, the very best teachers 
are secured that can be had, and they are paid better salaries than the same grade of 
teachers are paid in any other part of the country, North or South. And further than 
that, every possible encouragement and help is given them to prepare for a better 
grade of work. Besides a well eanipDed State Normal College, equal advantages are 
offered their teachers in summer schools and institutes. It is my opinion that the 
race needs, more than anything else, to be let alone by their overzealous friends, 
and given time to work out their own destiny. . . . The race is manifesting, as a 
whole, as commendable ambition to improve its condition as any race in like intel- 
lectual, social, and financial conditions under the sun. . . . The people of the State 
   
-P-A-G-E-160

are willing to be taxed for their education, and to extend to them every assistance 
except to lower their own social status, that they may elevate by a mite the 
negro’s. . . . Any assistance rendered from abroad in the attempt to better the 
condition of these people by the charitably disposed will be most heartily welcomed. 
unless it is attended with the insult to the public sentiment of the State in trying 
to educate white and black side by side in the same schools.” 
GEORGIA. 
Report for 1895, Hon. G. R. Glenn, State school commissioner. 
The present system of public school education in the State is ‘‘ totally and radically 
inadequate,” and the legislature is urged to come to itshelp. The commissioner had 
already visited the schools in every county in the State except ten, and would visit 
these before the meeting of the legislature. This observation has convinced him of 
the sore needs of very many rural districts whose meager facilities of getting educa- 
tion for the children has been one of the principal causes of that constantly growing 
exodus from the conntry into the towns, which, in his opinion, tends to hurt the 
general well-being of the State. 
Investigation of criminal statistics in many of the counties shows that far larger 
amounts have been expended in the prosecution of criminals than toward education. 
From this fact the commissioner argues that, the greater number of crimes being 
committed by illiterate persons, saving would be mado by making more efficient 
provision for education of the people, and he cites the great diminution of crimes 
in England, which are plainly shown to be attributed to the increase of intelligence. 
Commendation is made of the results of establishing teachers’ institutes. These 
have been held in conformity to law, experts being hired to conduct the meetings. 
This expert is most inadequately paid for his services, the wages, often being 
exhausted by expenses, leaving nothing for his work. For the purpose of providing 
better payment forsuch valuable work, the commissioner combined several counties 
in the last year. 
A large space is given to the evidently rapid increase of education among the 
negroes. It is maintained that on the whole they have made good use of their 
opportunities, and the commissioner trusts that in good time they are to become 
of much increased value to the State. He says: 
“By nature the negro is impulsive, by nature he is sympathetic, by nature he is 
emotional and easily excited; he is instinctively loyal and generous. If the good 
qualities of his head and heart are wisely directed by proper educational processes, 
he can become, and I believe will become, a most potential factor in aiding the 
Southern people to work out their industrial problem. It is a gr mistake to sup- 
pose that education hurts the colored man and unfits him for service. A little false 
education and misdirected education may do this, but the natural and normal devel- 
opment of the life and character of the negro, as has been shown already in'so many 
notable instances, will make him a most valuable aid to us as a people. I find, wher- 
ever I have gone in the State, a growing disposition on the part of the intelligent 
colored men to show their sense of gratification for the aid that the white people of 
Georgia are giving the race by cultivating the kindliest and most helpful relations 
between themselves and their white neighbors and friends.” 
The commissioner calculates that 250,000 children of school age do not attend 
school. ‘The greater part of the latter are in rural districts, where a majority of the 
children labor on the farm. Besides, as he says, ‘‘the schoolhouses in the country 
are so uncomfortable that the schools must be held in the spring and summer.” 
Some improvement has been made in the matter of reading circles through the 
praiseworthy instigation of the county school commissioners, a fact promising good 
results in the growing professional spirit generally among teachers, leading them to 
increased habits of becoming acquainted, through reading, with general literature 
outside of text-books. 
Much congratulation is indulged on the entire success of the normal school at 
Athens, which is now under the management of Mr. 8. D. Bradwell, former State 
school commissioner. Pupils from at least eighty counties are in attendance, and 
interest amounting to enthusiasm prevails among them and the professors. 
Much praise is bestowed upon the Georgia Normal and Industrial College at Mil- 
ledgeville, founded upon the highly satisfactory report of President Chappell. The 
rush to this institution has been noteworthy. At the opening, which took place 
only a few days before the issuing of this report, more than one hundred applicants 
had to be rejected, notwithstanding the fact that a large building had been recently 
erected which furnished accommodations for 135 additional students. 
The Georgia Agricultural College at Dahlonega, getting an allowance of only 
$2,000 from the State, far overpays, it is claimed, in returns,

ing its foundation.

  ILLINOIS. 
CHICAGO SCHOOL REPORT. 
Report for 1896, Daniel R. Cameron, president of the board of education, Albert G. Lane, superin- 
tendent of schools.   
It is a gratifying fact that the new sittings provided during the year were fully 
up to increased enrollment. The latter has gone to 215,784, an increase over last 
year of 14,404. Increase of sittings have been equivalent to sixteen twenty-room 
buildings. : 
It seems a misfortune that the financial resources had to be reduced. 
Under the head of ‘‘Need of more responsible management” many well-considered 
observations are ade. Want of entire certitude in the educational laws makes 
inevitable occasional conflict of claims among some school officials, and itis inti- 
mated that a more certain and strong authority should be intrusted to the governing 
head in the system. ‘The report says: 
“A clear, well-balanced mind is seldom at conflict with itself, hence the wisdom 
of making selection of one respectable head of affairs, to whom may be committed 
the management of the same, but who is empowered to work out. his own plans with 
an eye single to an accountability that is commensurate with his trusted powers. 
... It is my belief that a competent man of affairs, with large executive powers, 
conversant with men and values, . . . if chosen in the capacity of, let me suggest. a 
business director of all its business affairs, subject always to review by the board, 
at a liberal salary, would, by the introduction of business methods into the adminis- 
tration of our attairs, so effect a saving in our expenditures as would compensate for 
his salary many times over and bring about a more rational system of procedure in 
all our business relations.” 
The board has accepted from the board of commissioners what was known as the 
Cook County Normal School. 
Suggestions are made regarding vacation schools for the children who can not 
leave the city during July and August and regarding the introduction into the high 
schools of a course upon commercial interests for the purpose of having men trained 
for foreign service and correspondence, 
Organization has been effected under the law of the last legislature providing a 
pension and retirement fund for disabled teachers. The pension board consists of 
the board of education, the superintendent of schools, and two members to be 
annually elected by teachers and employers. 
INDIANA. 
Report for 1895 and 1896, Hon. David M. Geeting, State superintendent. 
The report appeals to the general assembly for additional school legislation. One 
is that high-school accommodations be furnished free to common-school graduates ; 
another that teachers’ licenses should be given by the State superintendent, thereby 
making them valid throughout the State; another that a law be enacted providing 
for qualification of county and city superintendents; another for a district library 
system; another for authority in the State board of education to recognize certificates 
from other States. 
The report discusses and clearly defines the word “uniformity” in the law, show- 
ing that it means that actual advantages of every kind must be distributed equably. 
It says: 
“While the boys and girls of the cities and towns have access to the privilege of 
high schools free, the children of the rural districts have been shut off from these 
privileges, except in some of the best counties and townships. . . . The school laws 
of the State not only grant to township trustees the privilege of establishing higher 
departments of learning for the children in the country districts, but I believe they 
compel these officers to furnish these ad vantages to all who are sufficiently advanced.” 
Yet, so the report says, the law is so framed that the trustees, if they see fit to do 
so, nay refuse. Enrollment is shown to be much larger in townships wherein State 
advantages may be had than elsewhere. The following are among the concluding 
words of the superintendent on this subject: 
“T believe that if every township in Indiana would support a good high school, so 
   
-P-A-G-E-162
  1290 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
that every child would have advantage of the same free, it would be only a few 
years until we would have as large a voluntary attendance in the public schools in 
the rural districts as a compulsory law would give.” 
‘Tho report urges a change in the license law so that examination papers may bo 
graded by the State superintendent and become a State instead of a county license. 
Asitis there aronow as many as ninety-two different standards, theresult of whichis 
that in some localities there are excellent, in others very poor, teachers, Tho change 
proposed would equalize school advantages, equalize ways, do away with personal 
partisan influences, and allow to county superintendents time to plan their proper 
work. 
Complaint is repeated in the matter of incapacity of many county superintendents, 
the law unfortunately prescribing no educational qualification. Quitea large space 
is given to this subject, which has been much discussed among county superintend- 
ents, the views of many of whom are against those presented in this report. 
Again the report calls attention to the fact that the State delays to recognize 
teachers’ certificates granted in other States. This operates to the hurt of teachers 
going into other States and having their certificates ignored, because, as it says, 
“many of the States, particularly in the West, are authorized to extend such courte- 
sies only to such States as reciprocate the favor.” 
The State manual and uniform course of study is reviewed at considerable length. 
The Teachers’ Reading Circle and the Young People’s Reading Circle advance in 
development. . 
There are two grades for State licenses—one for a period of eight years, termed a 
professional license, the other for life, called life State license. 
The eight years license is obtained after having gotten consecutively two of thirty- 
six months, but holders must pass examination before the county superintendent 
prescribed by the State board of education, whose approval must accompany the 
license. 
The report gives with some minuteness an account of the various school funds. 
Tho Congressional township fund, beginning with the grant of land by Congress in 
1816, which, by permission of that body, was sold in 1827, and the proceeds becamo 
a trust fund. Another is the State’s share of the surplus revenue of the United 
States distributed in 1836. This is called the surplus revenue fund. Another is the 
bank-tax fund, raised upon the State’s interest in the State bank established in 1834, 
Another is the saline fund, dating back to an act of Congress in 1816 regarding the 
salt springs within the then Territory. Another is the sinking fund created in 1834. 
Another is what is known as the seminary fund, created in 1816. 
County institutes have advanced much in importance. Some needed improvements 
are recommended. One is that the State board of education “or other educational 
body” be empowered to certify to the fitness of teachers; another that in township 
institutes attendance should be made compulsory, and another for the more liberal 
compensation for instruction. The institution needs more compact and intelligent 
organization. This would do away with the want of money, much of which is dis- 
sipated by lack of such organization as is recommended, 
The report gives a history of the Indiana University. This is accompanied by 
excellent photogravures of seyeral of its buildings. Increase in students becomes 
constantly larger, those in the summer courses of 1896 being more than in the entire 
year ten years back. 
The question whether the State should adopt compulsory education is discussed 
at much length, various “factors” mentioned and enlarged upon, one of these 
being that while school cnumeration in 1896 was 798,917, enrollment 529,345, attend- 
ance was only 392,015. 
  KANSAS. 
Report for 1895 and 1896, Hon. Edmund Stanley, State superintendent of public instruction. 
The want of normal training schools for preparing teachers is much regretted. 
The work of the normal institutes has been of great volume. Institutes have been 
held in every county during periods extending from four to ten weeks, and the com- 
petent instructors in them have brought about much improvement in the teaching 
force. It is desirable and so recommended that these institutes be made professional 
schools in order, among other things, to secure entirely satisfactory persons to pre- 
side over them. At present they are under control of county superintendents, 
although the conductors and instructors are selected by the board of education, and 
the evidences of their qualifications of every sort must be made clear under a series 
of requirements notably exalting. 
Under the title ‘‘Management and supervision of the common schools” there are 
many well-considered observations. The report argues for the State’s assuming 
entire supervision and control over all that is employed for organizing and conduct-
-P-A-G-E-163
*KANSAS—KENTUCKY. 1291 
ing the schools, to which end the first essential is high-grade teachers. It is unfor- 
tunate that no larger per cent of the teachers can be supplied by the normal school, 
and that choice must often be made among those of inadequate preparation beyond. 
mere academic work. In view of this condition the report earnestly recommends 
the creation of at least two additional normal schools. 
Commendation is bestowed upon the work done in private and denominational 
schools. Regarding the latter the report says: 
“Competition with the public-school system causes these schools to be less dog- 
matic and sectarian in their work, while at the same time their existence and influ- 
ence tend to emphasize the importance of moral and spiritual development as a part 
of the education the child should receive in private, denominational, and public 
schools alike.” 
There are several striking observations under the head “legislation.” It is con- 
tended that under the district system, as now existing, the schools are local rather 
than purely public. Every district determines the length of its school terms, with 
little exception the tax to be levied for its support, and under certain conditions 
may discontinue them altogether. In existing conditions of property disposition, 
some districts are very far behind others in educational advantages, as to competent 
teachers and duration of school terms, although subjected to higher educational taxa- 
tion. It appears that no district can be disorganized as long as it has more than 
two qualified voters, nor where there are any debts upon it. Women as well as men 
being qualified electors, it is not seldom that a single family can control the organ- 
ization, a fact which sometimes results in gross abuses. It seems most strange that 
under ashow of educating one or two children a maximum levy of tax is imposed 
which, under one and another pretext, accrues to a single person, who is said, with 
apparently entire aptness, to be ‘owner of a school district.” The report makes the 
following recommendation: 
“‘That in all districts having less than five legal electors the county superiatend- 
iven the power to appoint the members of the district board, select the 
the levy for school purposes, and determine whether a school shall bo 
maintained in the district or provision be made for the education of the children in 
other schools and.at the expense of the district.” 
Admitting the difficulty of putting forth any definite legislation regarding the 
tenure of teachers, it is a sore evil—the too frequent changes among them and other 
school officials. At present both teachers and superintendents, in some cases by the 
time they have become well used to their positions and familiar with their duties, 
are required to give place to new. The term of superintendent is two years. Such 
changes in supervision are less frequent in the city. 
The report argues that teachers’ certificates should be made for a longer period, 
and that high grades in examinations should be made permanent credits with their 
holders. Teachers’ examinations, it is contended, should be held about the time for 
opening the schools. 
The present superintendent dissents from the views of his predecessor touching 
uniformity of text-books in all the schools of the State. In his opinion, those suited 
to pupils resident in cities are not always suited to those in villages and rural 
schools. Uniformity in this regard leads to sameness, which is hurtful both to train- 
ing and development. The objection applies to every kind of school, graded and 
ungraded. There seems to be point in the following language: 
“State publication is unsafe as well asexpensive. Should this plan be attempted, 
the chances are wo should get a poor grade of books, and when the cost of copyright, 
plant for manufacturing and work in handling are taken into account (for all these 
must be paid for by the people), we must expect the same results that others have 
experienced—an expenditure of more money for inferior books than the best would 
cost in the open market.” 
The report cites the States of California and Indiana in support of his argument; 
and further, that books thus published by the State are of inferior quality, and liable 
to become worn in comparatively brief time. 
The superintendent urges that the standard for admission to high schools should 
be uniform, that gradation is a necessity in all schools, and he strenuously insists, like 
his predecessor, upon such legislation as will make provision for what is termed 
“the gap” between the common school and the college. 
      
   
KENTUCKY. 
LOUISVILLE SCHOOL REPORT. 
Tho report for 1896 is from E. H. Mark, esq., superintendent, and is preceded by an 
address from Albert A. Stoll, president of the school board, and reports of the several 
committees. The following is taken from the president’s address: 
“Tecan not refrain from calling attention to the fact that in many respects it is
-P-A-G-E-164
  1292 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
believed the course of study now in use in the schools is too heavy. In my hum- 
ble opinion too much time is taken up with studies of little or no value, to the 
detriment of many cardinal branches of practicai education, and it is to be hoped 
that steps willsoon be taken to remedy this objection. Too much can not be said 
of the importance of an increase in the school revenue. It is highly important that 
the revenue of the public schools should be increased yearly, yet the past year shows 
a decrease.” 
The address urges especially the pressing need of erecting an entirely new building 
for the girls’ high school, suggesting that the one now used be given up to the boys. 
The fund needed can be raised only by direct taxation, but it is asserted that the 
people would submit to it cheerfully. 
The committee on salaries and supplies recommended increase in the salaries of 
several of the teachers in advanced positions, and that the schedule of salaries in 
general be based on the principle that all should be according to the rank and meri- 
toriousness of services, instead of averaging them, as at present, between the highest 
and the lowest salaries paid. All teachers should have set before them the sure 
prospect of rising wages according to increase in their professional experience and 
value. 
The continued increase of school children makes necessary frequent rents of rooms, 
as well for colored children as white. 
A historical sketch is given of the earliest attempts to found a manual-training 
high school since its induction into the country at the Centennial Exposition at 
Philadelphia. The hostility of trade and labor unions long obstructed these attempts, 
but persistence was at last rewarded and the school was founded in May, 1892. 
The plan of instruction followed in the manual-training high school, says the 
report, “is such as will fit boys of ability who are mechanically or scientifically 
inclined, and who may have neither the time nor means to continue at our school 
after they become 17 or 18 years of age, for positions of usefulness in the various 
productive and construction pursuits. It also prepares students who desire to con- 
tinue their education in technological branches for the best engineering and scientific 
schools in this country.” 
Attendance on the evening schools had decreased from last year, owing mainly, as 
the report believes, to the hard times. Out of 1,150 whites enrolled, the average 
attendance was 639.1. It was 861 among colored pupils in an enrollment of 1,867. 
Corresponding falling off for the same reason was in the high schools. 
The total number of pupils enrolled during the year in the day schools was 24,860, 
of whom 5,071 were colored. The average daily attendance among whites was 
15,311; among colored, 3,258. 
MAINE. 
Report for 1895, W. W. Stetson, State superintendent of common schools. 
The legislature, in compliance with the suggestion of Mr. Luce, late superintend- 
ent, repealed the law of biennial reports. The new superintendent cordially 
indorses the change, which brings the superintendent in more frequent and close 
peeroneion with subordinate superintendents, teachers, and other school 
officials, 
The decrease in the whole number of different pupils attending school at any time 
during the year is accounted for by the law raising the school age from 4 to 5 years. 
The increase in the average length of the time during which the schools were open 
is said to be owing to the fact that the town system, while reducing the number of 
schools, increased their length. There has beex some increase in the amounts paid 
for text-books and other school appointments, and it is a gratifying fact that such 
things cost only about one-third of what was paid under the old system. The 
superior value of the town system over the old is quite notable in the decrease in 
the number of ungraded and increase in that of graded schools. There has been 
abandonment of many of the schoolhouses whose condition was poor, which led to 
the erection of an increased number of those well suited for all purposes. 
The superintendent visited two hundred of the rural schools, with a view to becom- 
ing acquainted as accurately as possible, by personal inspection, with their condition 
and needs. Among these were several in the extreme portions and most sparsely 
settled. Of these, in the elaborate investigations had by him, 6 per cent were ranked 
as ‘excellent,’ 21 per cent as “good,” 32 per cent as “fair,” and 41 per cent as 
“poor,” or “very poor.” 
‘The circumstance is noted that inferior schools are not peculiar to sections uncul- 
tivated and remote from educational centers, but are scattered throughout the State. 
Some of the best are to be found in the former, and a few of the very foremost are in 
towns most advanced. Even among teachers, there are some who, claiming to be 
graduates of institutions of respectable standing, yet are among the poorest, appar-

ently little cultured in text-books and woefully devoid of knowledge outside of them. 
Some of them are extremely young, in one case only 15 years old. 
Another matter was made manifest in the examination of the rural schools. This 
was an occasional glaring advertisement of tradesmen’s wares on the walls. One of 
these was of a highly exalted brand of tobacco. 
It speaks not well for these districts that s0 many of the children quit school at 
a too early age. Eighty-seven per cent in them were under 13 years, and, as far as 
could be ascertained, those who had left had not gone to higher schools. Unfortu- 
nately, this tendency has been increasing for some time past, notwithstanding the 
law, which requires every child between 5 and 15 years to attend school for at least 
sixteen weeks in every year. The average of attendance in the schools attended 
was 21, average length of term ten weeks, and the average age of pupils between 
8and 9 years. The weak point in them, as appears from these figures, was not so 
much in the small attendance as in the early age at which pupils are withdrawn. 
A very small number of the rural schools were supplied with books and other 
appurtenances for supplementary work in studies. None had what might be called 
libraries. About 90 per cent were supplied with maps, but the majority of these 
were old and of little worth. About 50 per cent were supplied with some sorts of 
charts. Bookkeeping, civics, music, drawing, instruction about plants, minerals, 
and animals hardly obtain at all. 
‘The superintendent urges the creation of a State board of examiners for deciding 
upon the applications of teachers. The liberal sum (over $500,000) appropriated by 
the legislature demands that its distribution should be in the hands of capable 
experts. 
The report for the normal school refers to the fact that the trustees at their meet- 
‘ing in March arranged for a three years’ course of study. . This gives facilities to 
students who desire to do advanced work. 
It commends the great benefit to education of the law providing for the State 
certification of teachers. Applications have been made for them by a much larger 
number of teachers than was anticipated. 
The last legislature provided for holding at least three summer schools. A yet 
larger number was held, and although such institutions are new among the people 
the attendance was good, being more than double that of a year ago.   
  1896. 
The report for the year 1896 is from the same superintendent, W. W. Stetson. 
An increased interest in schools is quite apparent among the people at large. 
The old typified and stereotyped reports ‘that everything in the line was going on 
quietly and satisfactorily” served to hinder investigation and inquiry, and people 
were about settled in the notion that the sch were doing reasonably well, at 
least as well as could be expected under the circumstances. But close personal 
investigations by an expert superintendent showed numerous defects. These, as 
he could not honorably fail to do, he laid bare, and called public attention to them. 
The statistics of school superintendents exhibited some rather curious things. 
There could hardly be greater variety in a like number of officials in other positions. 
They are of many vocations. Thirty-five per cent (the greatest) are farmers; the 
rest are teachers, physicians, housekeepers, merchants, lawyers, clergymen, car- 
penters, lumbermen, laborers, druggists, journalists, fishermen, postmasters, en- 
gineers, painters, stonecutters, blacksmiths, and one each of express agents, book- 
keepers, guides, saw filers, surveyors, ferrymen, barbers, printers, manufacturers, 
haberdashers, railroad postal clerks, dairymen, and spinsters. Four per cent 
devote all their time to this business. The rest devote such time as they are willing 
to take from their personal affairs. This shows that selections are made indiffer- 
entiy among those who are not expected to have much fitness for their positions or 
busy themselves much in looking after its responsibilities. The report shows a 
Jarge portion of the schoolhouses in poor condition, with yards of insufficient, some 
even of undefined, areas. 
Seventy-one per cent of the teachers are residents of the towns in which they teach, 
12 per cent are of kin to some of the superintending school committees, and 5 per 
cent by marriage or business association. 
Some very interesting things are said under the head of ‘Statistical curiosities ;” 
more so under that of ‘“‘ Waste,” in which the greatest item is the wages paid to 
teachers, who, in every quality desirable for the work for which they are employed 
(intellectually and in respect of personality), are woefully deficient. The employ- 
ment of such teachers is what the report styles being ‘‘economical to the point of 
the most reckless extravagance.”

  1294 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
MARYLAND. 
Report for 1896, Hon, E. B. Prettyman, secretary State board of education. 
The subreports coming in from county examiners and the principals of State acade- 
mies and schools receiving donations from the State allshow gratifying improvement 
in education. 
It appears that hostility to the public system, although continuing, is constantly 
diminishing, and is directed rather to individual things than to the whole. Attempts 
were made at the last legislature to have school commissioners elected by the people, 
instead of receiving their appointment from the governor. It is hardly probable 
that, if such a law had been passed, it would have failed to be speedily shown 
imprudent and impracticable and been repealed. In the meantime, however, much 
harm might have been done, which it would have taken several years to cure. As it 
is, the average among such examiners is acknowledged to be high. Among them are 
the most prudent, thoughtful men, who study the school problem with sincerest 
intent for whatever is best for the conduct and operation of the schools. If elections 
were held by the people, such men or a majority of them would refuse to run for 
offices, elections to which are to depend upon partisan machinations, with which they 
would shrink from entangling themselves, and they would be sought by a class 
whose eagerness to obtain them would be the more fiery according to their incapacity 
to the discharge of their functions. 
Much felicitation is indulged on the passage of the free text-book law. It is 
claimed'to have largely increased attendance and elevated the standard of education , 
renerally. 
: Among the many recommendations for the consideration of the committeo on 
programme for the next session are the following: 
Sufficient State funds to pay all teachers’ salaries. 
Salaries of all teachers throughout the State to be arranged between the State 
board of education and the city and county school boards. 
County funds to pay strictly local expenses of schoolhouses, furniture, fuel, etc.; 
county supervision by school board. 
Separation of the offices of State superintendent and principal of the normal school. 
Separation of the offices of county examiner and secretary and treasurer of the 
county boards. 
Obligatory annual sessions of teachers’ institutes and associations in all the coun- 
ties of the State. 
‘The consolidation of rural schools and the transportation of distant pupils at the 
public expense. 
A number of well-considered suggestions occur in the last pago of Mr. Prettyman’s 
report in behalf of the State board, of which he is secretary, and at the same time ex 
officio State superintendent. He was one of the most earnest among the supporters 
of the free text-book system. He claims that the annual appropriation fixed by the 
last legislature of $150,000 has served already to increase attendance from 10 te 30 
per cent. He urges, among other things, provisions for additional and higher grade 
of teachers’ certificates; that is, high-school certificates. The appeal regarding the 
essential need of separating the two highly responsible positions, at present united 
in himself, is in the following words: 
“Tt has been repeatedly urged that there should be a separation of the duties of 
the principal of the State nermal school from those of the State superintendent of 
public instrnetion. It is manifest, in the present condition of the public-school 
system of the State, after the experience of thirty years, and considering its gradual 
but steady development, that one person can not perform the duties pertaining to 
the two positions named. . . . It is impossible for the normal school principal to give 
it proper attention and also attend a teachers’ institute in cach county in the State, 
visit the high schools, conduct the voluminous correspondence of the education depart- 
ment, prepare tho annual State report, and perform the other duties now required by 
law. He is obliged continually to elect between conflicting duties. This is the only 
State in which such manifold duties are united in one office.” 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
Report for 1894-95, Hon. Frank A. Hill, secretary of State board of education. 
Comment is made in the beginning on the gradual assumption by the State of 
active control over the subject of State education. This has been done thus far 
gradually, because of the indisposition of many towns to part from the exercise of 
what they have been deeming vested rights. Yet the obvious advantage of having 
   
-P-A-G-E-167
MASSACHUSETTS. 1295 
superintendents who have been specially trained for their service has tended to over- 
come this reluctance. The board recommend that supervision be extended on geo- 
graphieal lines. For the formation of districts by town meetings they would 
substitute school committees, who are in position to be better acquainted with the 
subject. 
They argue, further, that since the establishment of the system of district super- 
intendents they, the board, should be invested with the power of examining and 
issuing certificates, and that provision by law should be made for the additional 
force which such increased responsibility would make necessary. 
The State has now ten normal schools, whose results have been highly valuable to 
general education. This is so apparent that the board insist that hereafter candi- 
dates who have not passed through those schools should be required at least to give 
evidence of proficiency corresponding with that of those who have. : 
The normal schools are declared to be advancing satisfactorily, each with its ow: 
peculiar distinctive features, which are owing to different individualities among 
teachers, individualities with which the board wisely deem it improper to interfere. 
All of them except two are coeducational, Framingham and Salem being for girls 
only. In each are declared to be teachers of much ability. This fact, as well as the 
constantly enhancing value of high-school education, is considered by the board as 
lessening the preferenco for private schools, yet shown by many parents. 
The board intimate an intention to move for a compulsory law regarding desks, 
chairs, and other furniture. 
In the matter of the normal art school the standard was raised in 1895, requiring 
candidates for entrance to have s high-school] diploma or its equivalent. The diffi- 
culties arising from lack of opportunity for those fitting to be teachers to observe 
the drawing work done in the schools of Boston have been removed by permission 
received from the latter to observe and teach there. 
It has become a matter of serious consideration as to whether those susceptible of 
considerable improvement in schools for defectives ought to be sent back home after 
attaining the degree of improvement possible or kept within the institutions. It 
has been found that in many cases such return is not desirable on the score of what 
is best for the invalid, and they have been retained. But this course has served to 
overcrowd the schools and hinder the taking in of many to whom there is a erying 
need of being received. In view of the difficulty in drawing sharp lines between the 
most gifted of the feeble-minded and those least so among the normal, much pains- 
taking and even much delicacy in dealing with the subject will be required. The 
board commends it to the legislature as one deserving of careful consideration and 
liberal expenditure of moneys in providing for whatever is decided to be practicable. 
School attendance for the year shows a large increase, 11,984 larger than that in 
the enrollment of children between 5 and 15. This increase is attributed to the 
large numbers outside of these ages who attend schools and to the growth of kinder- 
gartens and high schools. 
In the matter of the comparative numbers of men and women teachers, the pre- 
ponderance keeps with the latter. The men, however, are gaining somewhat, the 
present ratio being about 1to10. The secretary admits that tho teaching force must 
be mado up of women mostly, but contends that their preponderance has been too 
great. Referring to the year 1886, he says ‘‘ while the number of men is 14 less than 
in that year, that of women is 2,371 greater.” 
The disparity between tho wages of men and women is yet great. Yet the scere- 
tary regards it not as unreasonably so as it appears, and for this reason: 
“Tt should not be forgotten, when we comment unfavorably upon this disparity, 
that the men almost invariably hold positions of directorship, or of superior respon- 
sibility, and that when women are put in any of these higher positions, as they 
sometimes are, their pay is not much, if at all, inferior to that of men. It is cer- 
tainly far above the average paid to women. This is conspicuously true in those 
cases in which women serve as superintendents of schools, their pay being the same 
usually as that of men holding corresponding positions. On the other hand, if there 
is a class of positions that aro commonly filled by women and that grade alike in 
pay, the salary of the man who is occasionally appointed to serve in this class is 
likely to follow that of tho women init. Here we have, as it were, exchange of posi- 
tions—women taking their place sfnong men and men taking their place among 
women—in which it appears that compensation rests more upon the popular esti- 
mate of the magnitude of the position filled than upon considerations of sex. 
‘The secretary makes some very judicious remarks upon the tendency of methods 
which have been consfantly improved upon to teach pupils other things besides 
knowledge of text-books, such as development of taste, exaltation of character, more 
just views of the purposes of life—in short, cultivation of all elements needed in the 
making of manhood and womanhood.

    1296 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
1895-96. 
The constant advance in education and in the development of the State system in 
Massachusetts is véry notable. Interesting is.the following extract from the article 
headed ‘Schools and teachers” in the report for this year: 
“Tt appears from the school returns of 1895-96 that there were in the State 9,153 
public schools, taught by 12,275 teachers. Of this number, 4,540 received some 
training in the State normal schools, and 3,903 have completed the prescribed course 
of normal instruction. ... As the schools of a country are inevitably what the 
teachers make them to be, reason, experience, and even public sentiment seem now 
in favor of limiting their selection and employment to those who by natural and 
acquired qualifications are specially prepared for their work. The State will soon 
be provided with normal schools, thoroughly organized, sufficient in number and 
conveniently located for the instruction of teachers required for the public schools. 
. - Inthe opinion of many prominent educators the time has come when school 
boards should be required to employ no other persons as instructors of their public 
schools than graduates of normal schools or those who have had an equivalent for 
teaching. If necessary, the small towns should receive special aid from the State 
to enable them to comply with this requirement.” 
In addition to the six already existing four others are in rapid process of estab- 
lishment. In connection with these institutions it is intended to create what are 
termed practice schools, by which those expecting to become teachers may acquire 
some experience in that line before entering upon it. 
A part of the educational system is a board of agents who, although without 
control over the management of schools, visit them, observing the condition of build- 
ings, text-books, ete., state of school attendance, courses of studies, and afterwards 
report on these to higher officials. They also conduct teachers’ institutes, and have 
been notably efficient in aid and encouragement of smaller towns to form themselves 
into districts for the employment of union school superintendents. Detailed reports 
of their work are appended. 
Much stress is laid upon the value of school supervision and itsextent in the State. 
The report says: 
“Supervision has, by the voluntary action of the towns and cities, steadily won 
its way into public favor, until 259 towns, embracing 93 per cent of all the 
school children in the State, have their schools under the care of intelligent 
superintendents, ‘ 
“There are now 94 towns not under supervision” says the report. ‘‘ These are 
mostly small country towns, many of them heavily burdened with taxation for the 
support of schools and other town purposes, but especially needing the benefits 
which flow from skilled supervision. Some of these towns have voted in favor of 
uniting in a district for the employment of a superintendent, but are unable to 
effect such union by reason of their relations to other towns and cities. They may 
be nearly cr quite surrounded by towns of too high a valuation to unite in a district 
entitled to State aid, or by towns now under supervision, or by those indifferent or 
averse to the plan.” 
Recommendation is made of such changes in the law as io render such supervision 
universal. 
The number of high schools has grown to 257, being 5 greater for the year. 
Education therein is provided for children from towns where high schools are not 
required by law. An act of the legislature provided for reimbursement of tuition 
to towns of less than $500,000 valuation. This will serve to bring secondary 
education within attainment of every child in the State. 
The advantages in manual training, as the law makes no distinction in that 
respect between boys and girls, are now favorable to the former, some of the things 
taught being practicable for both, while otbers are not so, such as foundry, machine, 
and other such work. 
An important feature in the system of education is the maintenance of evening 
schools, that are located mainly in manufacturing towns wherein children, because 
of employment, can not attend in the day. As many as 30,000 of these attend near 
700 schools. Since 1886 every town of 50,000 inhabitants is bound to maintain an 
evening high school. The chief difficulty is irregularity of attendance, due mainly 
to being voluntary. It is not believed to be well to extend the compulsory law in 
the case. Some remedy it is hoped will come from rendering schoolrooms more 
attractive and placing the schools under the charge of especially skillful teachers. 
As many as 4,000 teachers attend teachers’ institutes, seventeen of which were held 
in 1895, conducted by the secretary and State agents. They are regarded as insti- 
tutes of great value. 
Regarding provision for the blind, deaf, and feeble-minded, the following is some 
of the language of the report: 
“Massachusetts makes provision at her own expense for the care and education 
      
      
-P-A-G-E-169
  MASSACHUSETTS. 1297 
of all her deaf mutes and deaf children without any limitation as to the age of such 
beneficiaries, and without regard to the wealth or poverty of their parents or guar- 
dians. All such pupils are sent to the American School at Hartford, Conn., the 
Clarke School at Northampton, or the Horace Mann School at Boston. The State 
also makes ample provision for the education and support of the blind at the Perkins 
Institution and Massachusetts School for the Blind at South Boston.” This business 
is intrusted by the board to a committee of its own members, associated with whom 
is its secretary. ; 
The subject of truancy, under direction of the legislature of 1895, has been under 
investigation of an expert examiner, and further amendments to the law in case are 
being considered. 
The concluding words of the president of the State board are so thoughtful and 
pointed that we shall give them in full: 
“In the judgment of experienced observers the public schools are in danger 
of being overcrowded with work. The number and character of the studies now 
introduced into courses of public instruction are such as to prevent the best work 
being done in any of them. Some of these studies heretofore supposed to be impor- 
tant, such as the language we speak and write, are in danger of being greatly neg- 
lected. It would be well for the public schools of the Common vest if a new 
State course of instruction, founded on recognized principles of education, corld be 
made in accordance with the concurrent opinion of the ablest and most experienced. 
educators. Such a course should be simple in requirements, and adapted to the 
nature of the growing child as he passes through the different stages of his natural” 
development.” 
‘The secretary in his report discusses the fact that in many of the smaller towns 
the teachers are all women. Benign and indispensable as is the influence of women, 
yet it is regarded a misfortune when pupils at no stage come within that of men, 
and thus fail of acquiring certain degrees of robustness that only men are capable 
of im ng. 
This eport, after giving statement of the extremely liberal provision made by the 
State, discusses the much mooted question of the relations between State and local 
taxation. We give the following brief extract. Alluding to the former it says: 
“These measures have all proved helpful to the small towns, materially reducing 
great inequalities of school burdens, and making it possible for them to improve 
theirschools. They have left untouched, however, many other excessive inequalities ; 
nay, they have served to increase those inequalities somewhat, as when a town 
heavily burdened to support its own schools is not aided by the State, but never- 
theless contributes its own share toward aiding other towns.” 
‘The report closes with this summary of recommendations: 
(1) Universal and permanent supervision of the public schools; (2) professional 
training either in a normal school or in some equivalent way for all new teachers; 
(3) partial State participation in the support of all the public schools. Other rec- 
ommendations are on truancy, more satisfactory definition of high schools, system 
of sabbatical years and summer scholarship for the refreshment and inspiration of 
normal school teachers, and additional general expert service. 
    BOSTON SCHOOL REPORT. 
Report for 1893-94, Edwin P. Seaver, superintendent of public schools. 
The tables show that the number of pupils belonging to the day schools have 
increased to 65,588, an average increase for the last five years of more than 1,000. 
‘Yhe report, outside of the usual statistics, is occupied mainly with a discussion, 
extended, elaborate, and very acute, on secondary school studies, founded upon the 
“Report of the committee on secondary school studies appointed at a meeting of the 
National Educational Association, July 9, 1892, with the reports of the conferences 
arranged by this committee and held December 28-30, 1892.” 
Regarding this report Superintendent Seaver says: 
“Public high schools in particular have been distracted, and their courses of study 
have been wrecked by their striving to fulfill two separate purposes at the same time, 
namely, to give preparatory training for college, and to crown elementary education 
with a brief finishing course for practical life. The committee of ten have made 
recommendations which, if generally adopted, will unite these divergent purposes 
into one, and so give to the work of secondary schools throughout the country a 
desirable unity now wanting as well as enhanced strength and virtue. The deplor-. 
able gap which has long existed between the public high schools and colleges, in so 
far at least as the great majority of high-school pupils is concerned, will be closed up.” 
The report, arguing that mental habits may begin to be formed anterior to 14 years, 
contend that elements of various studies heretofore reserved for high schools may 
well begin in lower. 
ED 97 82  
-P-A-G-E-170
  1298 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
The committee, with becoming reserve, do not ask assent to their entire report, 
recognizing that several of its findings may well be considered debatable. Yet it is 
with much confidence that a change of relative duration in the high schools and 
those below is recommended. The rule in Boston is that 9 of the years from 6 to 18 
be given to primary and grammar schools, and the remaining three to the high 
schools. What is recommended is that the former be reduced to eight years an.i the 
latter raised to four. This change would not apply to the two public Latin schools 
whose courses extend already to 6 years. Into these schools, moreover, none are 
admitted except those with declared intention of getting a pinch of college education. 
Yet for many children such intentions can not be formed so early, and it isa hardship 
upon others in whom has not been developed fitness for the college course until after 
long stay in the high school. To remedy both these evils it is needful to open not 
only a direct road from the high school to the college, and in the words of the secre- 
tary, ‘‘not one road only, but two, three or four roads.” It is regarded a highly 
. important step toward the end sought by the committee of ten when Harvard College 
decided to accept substitutes for Greek among the requisites for admission. 
The four courses recommended by the committee are the classical, the Latin-scien- 
tific, the modern language, and the English. How a fourth year can be added to the 
present three years’ course is discussed, and suggestions offered, as that Latin and 
German or French and concrete geometry be begun in the fifth year, that algebra 
be studied in the last year of the grammar-school course, that spelling be learned 
incidentally from any subject studied and not from a spelling book, and others. 
Uniformity, that leading idea of graded-school systems, is handled with much acute- 
ness, and shown, in some respects, to be unreasonable and hurtful. In order to 
make the changes practicable it will be necessary to make revision, recastings, and 
transfers in schools and classes, the importance of which the secretary admits, pro- 
vided satisfactory adjustment of other questions is had, a matter which to him does 
not seem very difficult. These would be dealt with by the board of supervisors, if 
the school committee should decide to adopt the changes proposed or any portion of 
them. Another important matter is the view that was taken by the leading prin- 
cipals of schools who for some time past have nad the subject under consideration. 
189495. 
Number of pupils belonging to the day schools, 67,487, an increase of about 2,000. 
The report deals mainly with the grammar schools, and discusses the questions 
how many more pupils take more and how much mere, and how many take less and 
how much less than the course, which theoretically is six years. Minute calculations 
are made and considerations are taken of absence, differences of dates of entrance, 
etc.; added to these varying conditions of health, mental and moral weakness, 
domestic circumstances, which affect all schools. Yet much of the delay, it is 
argued, comes from inefficient teaching and indiscreet management of promotions. 
Says the report: 
“To the unequal operation of one or the other or both of these causes may be 
attributed the very considerable differences observable among the schools. eke 
There must be great difference in the management of promotions when we find a full 
half of the pupils in some schools taking six and a half or more years of actual attend- 
ance to finish the course (asin several schools herein mentioned), while in others 
only five and one-half years or less time was required by a majority of the pupils to 
jinish the same course.” 
‘The report contends that in some cases certain tendencies of all graded schools have 
greater influence upon teachers than is just, such as excessive drillings and reviewings 
in order to bring classes to a satisfactory average, a habit which tends to concentrate 
attention upon pupils of medium capacity and industry, to the neglect both of those 
that are particularly bright, who can dispense with it, and those who are so dull or 
indocile whose timely elevation is hopeless. It is recommended, and it is contended 
to be practicable, to make several divisions even of the same grade. Such divisions, 
instead of being delayed to the end of a session or of a term, should be made in their 
midst whenever found to be desirable, even when change of room is not to be had. 
Some teachers who are especially judicious do this now, as thereis no inhibition against 
a teacher beginning the next year’s work before the end of this, whenever the pupils 
are prepared for the rise. The report also recommends that the time spent on the 
grammar-school course could be shortened to the four years’ course, which, though 
containing the same matters, are divided into four grades instead of six. This offers 
opportunities for shortening the course in the grammar schools both in the beginning, 
and in the beginning of the second half; and, it is argued, the same methods of 
advancement ought to be practiced in primary schools, which are in greater need of 
increased effectiveness of teaching than the grammar schools. These are over- 
crowded, the old quota of 49 having been raised to 56, and this, the report contends, 
trom motives of economy erroneous and hurtfu..
-P-A-G-E-171
  MASSACHUSETTS—MICHIGAN. 1299 
An exhibit of the number of divisions in each grade shows the tendency to organ- 
ize with the smaller divisions in the upper and the larger ones in the lower grades, 
an unreasonable inequality it is believed. 
A considerable space is devoted to what is styled ‘‘enrichment” of the grammar- 
school course by the introduction therein of Latin, French, algebra, geometry, and 
physics, according to recomendations of the superintendent, and good results are 
confidently expected from what, it is hoped, will be voluntary action in its behalf on 
the part of masters. In this connection further remarks are made against strict 
uniformity, and the necessity of greater individuality in work according to varying 
degrees of heaith and mental ability. ni 
Praise is bestowed upon the working of the evening high school, attendance ‘in 
which during the last year was 73.5 per cent, a little less in the Charlestown and 
East Boston branches. 
For the normal school an annex of a “practice school” is warmly pressed, a mat- 
ter easily done in a city numbering 55 grammar schools. Considerable space is 
given to discussion of the parental school under the control of the school committee, 
and against certain ideas concerning which, being a penal institution, remonstrance 
is solemnly urged, the intent herein being not punishment for crimes but reformation 
of the wayward by inculcating intelligent self-control. 
The report is supplemented by other reports from the several supervisors. 
1895—96. 
Number of day pupils, 69,315. 
Excellent work has been done in manual training, including kindergartens and 
the primary schools, and recommendation is offered for courses in clay modeling for 
both the grammar grades and for high schools. Remarks are made upon the exten- 
sion of mechanical drawing, wood working, and while paste-board construction 
within moderate limits is commended, it is complained that in some schools it has 
been earried to needless excess, Some space is devoted to work done in the mechanic 
arts high school, the free evening drawing schools, and to the cooking now taught 
in fifteen public school kitchens. 
In accordance with the recommendations of the committee of ten, the course of 
study of some of the grammar schools has been “enriched,” and itis debated whether 
or not foreign languages and other high-school subjects should be introduced into the 
schools below. The matter is made voluntary with grammar-school masters, who 
will be guided by their own judgments as to its practicability in individual cases. 
This will need some modifications of existing courses. 
‘The superintendent recommends changes in the suburban high schools by which 
also students, both boys and girls, could be prepared for college. 
Regarding the introduction of advanced industrial instruction in existing Lizh 
schools for girls, as many persons advocate, the report, apprehending this to be 
inexpedient, suggests creation of another institution specially for that purpose.

OF JAMES BURRILL ANGELL, LL. D., JUNE 24, 1896,     
Regent Cocker’s Address. 
While the university is greatly indebted to the State for its generous aid and sup- 
port, the State is indebted to the university for its direct and wholesome influence 
on tho educational system of the State, and for the able men it has trained to pro- 
mote the varied interests of the Commonwealth and to honor its name in State and 
national affairs, It is, therefore, fitting, on this the twenty-fifth anniversary of Dr. 
Angell’s inauguration as president, that grateful acknowledgment should be made in 
behalf of the State of its indebtedness to the distinguished teacher who for so many 
years has devoted himself to its educational interests. 
It is greatly to the credit of the early settlers of Michigan that they took care 
that ‘good learning should not perish among us.” They were brave enough to face 
every danger and wise enough to found a university. While Michigan was still a 
Territory, and its population numbered only 6,000 or 7,000 persons, an act was 
passed creating a university. Our first lawgivers were not willing that knowledgo 
should be dependent on the chance charity of generous men of wealth. They estab- 
lished for all time, as far as this State is concerned, the great principle that ‘the 
education of the people is a public duty,” and that the appropriation of public 
money for this end is a legitimate public expenditure. They did not propose that 
learning should be buried in the graves of their forefathers.

  1300 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
The relation between the State and the university is so close, and tho influence of 
the university on the general welfare of the State is so great, that to shape and give 
proper direction to the work of the university is a grave responsibility. Few can 
appreciate the difficulties that the president of a State university has tomeet. There 
are so many and so conflicting views as to the relation of the State to higher educa- 
tion, so many changes in the governing board, so many local prejudices, and so much 
urcertainty regarding State appropriations, that an institution like our own encoun- 
ters greater dangers and requires greater wisdom in administration than do other 
institutions of learning whose policy is largely fixed by tradition, and whose inter- 
ests are conserved by a rich and powerful body of alumni. To place the university 
in the front rank of the great schools of learning with their rich endowments, to 
make the State known and respected abroad through its university, and in spite of 
opposing influences to make it the crowning glory of the State, require the highest 
wisdom and the rarest skill. All friends of the university gratefully recognize the 
indebtedness of this institution of learning to the distinguished scholar and teacher 
who now presides so ably over its interests. 
Not alone as a college president has Dr. Angell won distinction. He is a recognized 
authority on international law, and his writings and public addresses on the impor- 
tant questions of the hour have justly commanded general attention. The National 
Government, recognizing his exceptional fitness, sent him as minister plenipotentiary 
to China to negotiate a revision of an important treaty, and twice he has been 
selected by the Government of the United States to serve on important commissions. 
Whether as a representative of the university or of the State or of the National 
Government, he has worthily performed the duties intrusted to his care. The uni- 
versity rejoices in his well-earned distinctions and the State is justly proud of his 
achievements. 
Some one has said that ‘the worth of a college, whether Eastern or Western, of 
the Old World or the New, consists not in its history or its material equipment, but in 
the men who compose its teaching force.” This is especially true of this university. 
Its buildings are unpretentious, its endowments meager, its gifts few in number, and 
its life free from imposing ceremonies or impressive distinctions. From humble 
beginnings and without the associations of a venerable past it has rapidly grown 
and developed. Men of broad views and rich scholarship have served in its faculties 
and given breadth and character to learning. The university has been richly 
endowed with great teachers, if not with ample revenues. Its presidents have been 
gifted and scholarly men, who with rare skill have shaped its policy. During the 
twenty-five years of Dr. Angell’s administration the university has grown wonder- 
fully in the number of its students and in the breadth and character of its work. 
While it has carefully preserved what is of value in the methods and traditions 
of the older schools of learning, it has kept pace with the pressing demands of 
modern life. The fact has been duly recognized that a systematic and thorough 
training in the practical problems of the times in which we live is the prime func- 
tion of a university. The idea has been rapidly gaining ground that the universities 
throughout the land should be the great centers for the solution of the increasing 
number of economic questions that are crowding upon the attention of the people. 
Unless proper direction is given to the discussion of these perplexing questions 
there is danger of rash and hasty conclusions that may involve the country in need- 
less embarrassments or in hopeless confusion. While the study of the classics will 
always be sought for special lines of work and for the broad and generous culture 
which they bring, it is becoming more and more apparent that the student must also 
be made familiar with those practical problems that enter into the general life and 
future welfare of the nation. Modern research has revealed so many new and unex- 
pected sources of knowledge and suggested so many different lines of investigation 
that the character and whole plan oF college training has been undergoing a change. 
President Elliot in a recent address eloquently said that universities are no longer 
“merely students of the past, meditative observers of the present, or critics at a safe 
distance of the actual struggles and strifes of the working world; they are active 
participants in all the fundamental, progressive work of modern society.” 
But it is not for me to describe the changes that have taken place in the courses 
of study or to enumerate the additions that have been made to the departments of 
the university during the administration of Dr. Angell. His associates in the uni- 
versity senate will fittingly refer to these. 
To me, Dr. Angell, has been given the pleasant duty of offering the congratula- 
tions of the board of regents to you, its presiding officer, and of bearing willing 
testimony to the respect and esteem in which you are held by the several members 
of the board. Of your loyal affection for the university and of your zeal in pro- 
moting its varied interests we have had repeated and abundant proofs. To you the 
university is largely indebted for its present efficiency and for the honorable posi- 
tion it now maintains among the great schools of learning. I know of no greater 
distinction than wisely to have shaped the destinies of a young and vigorous insti- 
 
-P-A-G-E-173

tution of learning, and of no greater honor than worthily to have earned the con- 
fidence of a great body of students. I can wish nothing better for ihe university 
than that you, its honored president, may long be spared to direct its affairs and to 
honor the State with your public services. 
Address of the university senate. 
Mr. PresipENT: The senate of the university brings to you on this auspicious 
day, which commemorates the completion of your quarter centennial of service, its 
tribute of grateful recognition and personal esteem. 
We congratulate you and the university on the brilliant record of the past, and 
express to you our heartiest and best wishes for the future. As we turn back to the 
day of your inauguration we recall with deep emotion the glowing words of wel- 
come spoken to you by Dr. Frieze when you were inducted into the presidency. ‘To 
this work of high promise,” said he, ‘‘we have called you; leader in this grand 
educational enterprise we have made you. We sought one to take the helm who 
possessed at once the vigor and enthusiasm of youth and the calm prudence and 
patient waiting of riper years. We sought one of kindly heart and resolute will, 
of disciplined mind and cultured taste, equally at home in the seclusion of the study 
and in the public assembly, familiar with the institutions of foreign lands as well 
as our own, holding loyally to all that is good in the past, yet generously accepting 
all that is good in the present, and crowning all these gifts and attainments with 
the faith and the life of an earnest Christian. We pledge you our fraternal sym- 
pathy, our devoted friendship, and our unwavering support.” 
Looking back over the years that have since intervened, we mark these words as a 
prophecy of what we believe has been proved true, and we rejoice to-day at the ful- 
fillment of these bright hopes. 
You came to the university at a critical time, when she stood at the parting of the 
ways. The days of her infancy were ended. The plans of her great founder, Pres- 
ident Tappan, were waiting for more complete development. President Haven and 
President Frieze had guarded well the traditions already established, and sought to 
incorporate new ideas with her life. But the true university ideal was still but little 
more than an ideal, toward the realization of which we haye been working all these 
years under your wise and inspiring leadership. 
During this period of twenty-five years the growth of the university has been truly 
remarkable. Its resources have been trebled; its students have increased from 1,200 
to 3,000; its staff of instruction has grown more than four times as large, while the 
scope of its work has been extended by the addition of four new departments— 
the schools of dentistry, of pharmacy, of homeopathy, and of engineering. Within 
the department of literature, science, and the arts have been created several impor- 
tant chairs, while numerous facilities in the way of laboratories and seminaries and 
lectureships and apparatus have given added strength and value to all courses of 
instruction. But, as you have often taken occasion to remark, Mr. President, bigness 
is not greatness, and we find the most satisfactory and convincing proofs of the suc- 
cess of your administration in those less palpable but more valuable improvements 
and advances that are more spiritual than material, and that constitute most clearly 
the essential elements of a true university. As such elements we would name, first, 
the closer articulation of the university with the organic system of State education, 
of which itis the head. Under your fostering care this relation, which was instituted 
just before you came to us, has been made more vital, and has become increasingly 
fruitful of good both to secondary education and to the university. 
Another element of university progress is the development of the elective system, 
and the opportunity it affords for advanced work and scientific investigation. Of 
the beneficial results of this system, in the way of promoting scholarship and of 
giving to the life of the university a more mature and earnest spirit, there can be 
no doubt. 
This catholicity of purpose, this breaking down of the traditional class distine- 
tions, and this wide Lehrfreiheit have not been purchased at the price of solidity 
and discipline; and this happy result we owe in no small degree to your wise con- 
servatism and broad outlook over the whole field of education. Closely related to 
this movement for wider choice of studies and greater independence of a routine 
curriculum is the effort to foster graduate study, and to build up that higher side of 
the university that in the end must measure its real character and influence. 
Twenty-five years ago no graduate work, properly so called, was attempted. At 
present we have graduate courses of study in all departments of the university. 
To no one subject have your reports called more urgent attention than to the impor- 
tance of building up the most distinctive part of a true university. 
Closely allied to this forward movement is the constant advance made by our pro- 
fessional schools in their methods and standards of instruction. In looking over 
the record of these past years the conviction is gained that the university has in no  
-P-A-G-E-174
  1302 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
other direction made greater strides than in this. Twenty-five years ago there was 
no examination for admission to any one of our professional schools; to-day prelim- 
inary training that covers the equivalent of a good high-school course is required 
by all our professional departments. 
Then the term of both the law and the medical schools was six months for two 
years, and the instruction was given chiefly by lectures. Now our medical schools 
require a registration of four terms of nine months each, and set a standard for 
graduation that is as high as that of any medical school in this country, while tho 
law school has lengthened its course to three years of nine months each, and has 
signally raised its standard of graduation. In all these departments the.old style 
of instruction has been materially modified. or superseded by modern methods, in 
which laboratory practice and scientific research hold the most prominent place. 
The year before your induction into the presidency the doors of the university 
were first thrown open -to the admission of women. What was for a time a bold 
experiment has become an established success, and hundreds of young women who 
have worthily enjoyed the full privileges and advantages of the university on abso- 
lutely equal terms with young men are glad to bring you their tribute of gratitude 
for your just and wise administration, by which the interests of women in this uni- 
versity have been made secure. 
The entire life and spirit of the university during this period which we pass in 
review have been marked by a steady growth in good order and decorum, in friendly 
relations between pupils and teachers, and in all that makes for a wholesome intel- 
Jectual and moral atmosphere. 
That amid much and necessary diversity of interest there has been so much har- 
mony and unity in our councils as a senate and in the different faculties is due in no 
* small measure to your impartial conduct of affairs, your broad and generous views, 
your charitable spirit, and your gracious courtesy. That the university has safely 
passed through many crises, has gained respect and influence throughout our State 
and the entire land, is to be attributed in large degree to your skillful management, 
your experience in educational work, and to your high character as a citizen and as 
aman, 
We congratulate the university, Mr. President, upon the reputation you have justly 
earned for her—a reputation not bounded by the seas, but cherished also in the fair 
Orient and in the centers of European learning as well as at home, We recall with 
feelings of highest pride how our own National Government has thrice summoned 
you to high service in diplomacy and council. We are glad also to remember that 
in the discussion of the great educational problems of our day your words are ever 
welcomed as those of one who has authority to speak. , 
But most of all, we who have been associated with you these many years admire 
and esteem you for what you have been to us and to this beloved university. Tho 
cheerful and serene temper in which you have borne the heavy burden of your 
duties, the kind and gracious manner in which you have helped us to fulfill our 
tasks, the spirit of hopefulness for the future of this institution with which you 
have inspired us, the numberless tokens of personal kindness you have shown to us 
all—it is these daily ministrations of your life—if you will pardon what Plato would 
call too much downrightness of speech—that endear you to us all, Our memories 
thrill to-day with sacred recollections of the past, and we fancy we hear mingling 
with our words of greeting voices from the silent land of those beloved colleagues 
who twenty-five years ago stood here to bid you welcome to this post of honor, but 
who are with us now only in memory and in spirit, to join with us in these expres- 
sions of our esteem and praise. 
In closing these congratulations, Mr. President, the members of the senate are 
cheered by the hope that the same bond which has united us all these many years 
in common work and interest may be cemented still more firmly by future years of 
companionship in the great work in which we are engaged. May that divine Provi- 
dence that has blessed you so abundantly in tho past still attend you and prolong 
your days of fruitful service to this university, to which so much of your life has 
been given, and may the blessing of heaven be vouchsafed to her who during all 
this time has devoutly stood at yourside to aid you, and who by her deeds of kindness 
and helpfulness has made herself the friend of all our university community. 
Whatever be the future of this university, your work in its behalf shall be an 
abiding possession of good influence and power, and shall constitute one of the chief 
elements of its greatness and renown for all time. 
Resolutions of the State Teachers’ Association. 
Whereas this year completes the twenty-fifth anniversary of President Angell’s 
connection with the University of Michigan; 
Whereas during that time the growth of tho university has been marked not 
only by a large increase in the number of its students, but by the wisdom and 
enlightenment of a most liberal educational policy ;
-P-A-G-E-175
MICHIGAN. 1303 
Whereas the high schools of the State, and through them the common schools, 
have felt the inspiration and uplift of a close connection with the university, 
hundreds of young men and women of but moderate means having thus been led to 
set their faces ambitiously in the direction of university life and eulture; and 
Whereas in this respect no university in the country can be said to have exerted 
so widespread and salutary an influence upon popular education—an influence due 
in no small degree to the ripe scholar and able exeeutive who has the management 
of the university in charge: 
Resolved, That we, the teachers of Michigan, do hereby most gratefully express 
our appreciation of his eminent services to the cause of popular cducation in our 
Commonwealth ; 
Resolved, That while we congratulate him upon the distinguished success of his 
administration in the past, we do also express the hope that his genial presence may 
be spared to the State yet many s year to carry forward the interests so dear to 
is heart. 
President Angell’s response. 
Gentlemen of the Board of Regents, of the University Senate, and of the State 
Teachers’ Association: I beg to return my sincere thanks to you for the kind words 
with which you greet me on this the twenty-fifth anniversary of my inauguration. 
But my gratitude is mingled with a sense of humility as I consider how far, in 
my opinion, your estimate of the value of my services exceeds their real worth. ‘The 
partiality.of your friendship has ascribed to me merit far beyond my deserts. But 
the friendship is most dear to me, and this touching manifestation of it from those 
with whom it has been my rare good fortune to labor for so many years almost 
obliterates from my memory for the moment my failures and shortcomings and 
disappointments, which have sometimes oppressed me in my work. Your words 
embolden me to believe that those who know me best are persuaded that however E 
may have fallen below their ideals and below my own, yet with devotion to the 
interests of the university and of the State, and with the consecration of whatever 
powers God has bestowed on me, I have striven to do my whole duty. No higher 
reward could I hope or wish in return for my years of toil, with all their fatigues 
and anxieties, than the assurance from you, who best of all men know the difficulties 
that have been encountered and the results that have been aecomplished, that my 
work has not been altogether fruitless. 
But I should fail to do justice a& ones to the truth and to my own feelings if I 
did not hasten to say that all my efforts would have been in vain if I had not been 
counseled and assisted by so true and faithful men on the board of regents and in the 
faculties. The fidelity with which regents who had large business interests or 
engrossing professional duties have given time and thought and labor to the uni- 
versity has been an indispensablo element in its success. I know of no university 
which has been better cared for by its official guardians. I am glad of this oppor- 
tunity to thank the present members of the board and their predecessors for their 
unvarying kindness and helpfulness to me, J remember with tender interest that 
nine who have served on the board with me have died. 
What university has had a more choice collection of men in its faculties during 
the last quarter of a century than this? It is they who preeminently have made the 
university what it is. In my service and companionship with them is found one of 
the dearest memories of my life. Alas! that in so many eases the companionship has 
already been severed by death. Ont of the one hundred and seventy teachers now 
here, only seven were here when I came. You have quoted from the hearty greeting 
which my old teacher and life-long friend, Dr. Frieze, gave me on the day of my 
inauguration. Howvaluable were his counsels; how dear was his friendship to me to 
the day of his death; how in our long walks we used to dream dreams of the coming 
greatness and power and beneficence of this university. Many of these dreams, 
thanks in large part to his labors and influence, have already been realized in fact. 
Besides him death has snatched away how many noble and distinguished men, who 
had long served the university: Williams—good old Dr. Williams, as we always 
love to call him—Douglas, Sager, Cocker, Morris, Olney, Winchell, Campbell, Walker, 
Wells, Watson, Palmer, Crosby, Lyster, Ford, Dunster, the brothers Cheever, Elisha 
Jones, and, last of all, the venerable Feleh. One has only to call this roll of illus- 
trious names to understand why students from all parts of the Union and from the 
nations beyond the seas have flocked to these halls. They have been drawn hither 
to sit at the feet of these great teachers, and of others like them, who, thank God, 
are still spared to us, 
I can claim no merit save that of having heartily cooperated with these learned 
and wise instructors. Large asis our body of teachers, we have habitually followed 
one rule, which, in my opinion, has been of inestimable service, both in promoting 
the proverbial harmony and friendliness among us and in securing wise legislation 
   
-P-A-G-E-176
  1304 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
and successful administration. That rule is, never to make any important innovatioy 
on the vote of a bare majority, but to wait until we are substantially agreed on the 
wisdom of a change before introducing it. So we have wrought together with one 
heart and one mind, and in the enjoyment of the most delightful social relations. 
If I have accomplished anything here, it is mainly because my colleagues, from the 
oldest to the youngest, have so heartily stood by me, have been so patient withmy 
shortcomings, have so promptly responded to every request, nay, to every suggestion, 
which Ihave made. Never was a president surrounded by more helpful and loyal 
associates. _My heart runs out with gratitude to them for the innumerable acts by 
which they have lightened my burdens and made my tasks a pleasure. 
Nor would I forget to-day how helpful have been the relations which the students 
have chosen to maintain with me. Several thousand have come and gone during 
these twenty-five years. My heart is bound by the tenderest ties to the great com- 
pany of students whom I have seen going from these halls year after year. Nothing 
gives me keener joy or more pride in the university than to see them worthily occu- 
pying positions of influence and usefulness. No more pleasant experience comes to 
me than to receive their cordial greetings wherever I go. Their affection for their 
alma mater is an endowment more precious than untold treasures of silver and gold. 
Because we are sure of their devotion to her, we are full of hope for the future. 
I beg to assure my friends of the State Teachers’ Association that I appreciate 
most highly their words of welcome to-day. Nothing have I had more at heart 
during all these years than the cultivation of the closest relations between the uni- 
versity and the schools. Nothing has been more helpful to the university than the 
cordiality with which the schools have responded to our approaches to them. I 
believe that thus the schools and the university have been able to render most valu- 
able aid to each other, and so to make the Michigan system of public education 
worthy of the high commendation which it has so often elicited from competent 
observers. Nothing could give me higher satisfaction than to know that my sincere 
efforts to cooperate with the teachers in this valuable work have in their opinion 
been of any service. 
May I express my great gratification that you have invited representatives from 
our sister universities to be present with us to-day, and that so many of them have 
been kind enough to honor us with their presence. I have only fulfilled your desire 
in seeking by every means in my power to cultivate the most cordial relations with 
other colleges and universities. You have often heard me announce my belief that 
no good college or university hurts another good one. It is only the unworthy insti- 
tution that cherishes envy of another. We have always tried to learn all that was 
profitable to us from every other university. We hope that by some wise and brave 
experiments we too have thrown light, which other institutions have been glad to 
gain, on certain problems of higher education. There is work enough for us all to 
do. Great has been the revolution in college methods and administration within 
my recollection. We gladly send our salutations to all the sisterhood of colleges 
and universities, and express our ardent desire to cooperate with them in all efforts 
to enhance the value of the higher education for this and the coming-generations. 
And now, my friends, I hope it is not inappropriate for me to return my thanks to 
all who have evinced an interest, so unexpected to me, in the celebration of this day ; 
to my two friends whose lofty verse and stately music are so happily married in the 
ode we are about to hear; to this concourse of my neighbors from this city, my beloved 
home; to the many citizens gathered here from all parts of this State; to the alumni 
from all sections of the country; to numerous college presidents who have sent me 
kindly messages; to the public press of many cities and towns. I willingly believe 
that the interest in the celebration is mainly interest in the university. I greatly 
prefer that it should be so, but for the many gracious words and acts that [ am com- 
pelled to interpret as words and acts of personal kindness to me I am most humbly 
and profoundly grateful. 
Iam deeply touched by the delicate but positive recognition in the address of the 
services of my wife to the university; for aid in unnumbered ways through all the 
vicissitudes of these years, especially in the social responsibilities which fall here 
upon the president’s house, she is entitled to share with me to the full whatever 
honor this day can bring to me, In her name and in my own I beg to thank you. 
In the course of nature the day is not remote when some other man must take the 
ofticial responsibility which has for a quarter of a century rested on me and which 
has so greatly increased since I assumed it. I pray that ho may be a stronger and 
wiser man than I have been. I am sure that the kind consideration which regents 
and faculties and students and the public have shown to me make a strong and wise 
man more willing than he might otherwise be to accept the high and sacred trust. 
- If such shall prove to be the fact, the celebration of this day will have amply justi- 
fied itself. Meanwhile, for myself, allow me to make my closing like my opening 
words—thanks, thanks, my heartiest thanks.

DETROIT SCHOOL REPORT. 
Report for 1896, William E. Robinson, superintendent of schools. 
The report suggests that the doings of the board, except the appointment of 
teachers and such other business as should be conducted in executive session, should 
be more often and clearly before the sight of the people in general, and that less use 
of committees be made in matters which might be and should be determined in full 
meeting of the board, sessions of which should be weekly instead of bimonthly, as 
heretofore. It suggests that no matter involving expenditure of money (except when 
of inconsiderable amounts) should be determined at the session into which it is 
introduced. 
The report admits some want of carefulness in the selection of sites for school 
buildings. It offers felicitations on the approach of completion of the new firmly 
equipped high school, yet it suggests that there is danger of overestimating educa- 
tion as at present conducted there, and that it should be made more practical. The 
following are some of the words upon the subject: 
“Why not establish a course eliminating the classics and polite languages, and in 
its stead supply shorthand, typewriting, commercial bookkeeping, banking, and 
matters of everyday business. Out of the 30,000 children at present in our schools, 
our experience has shown us that less than 2,000 will ever enter the high school 
and less than 150 ever graduate; and it seems to me that even before the high school 
is reached this matter of practical everyday education should be attempted.” 
Other changes are suggested in other schools, as for introduction of bookkeeping 
into the eighth grade of the grammar schools. A school for the deaf and dumb has 
lately been created, but as yet there is no report. 
The report apprehends that moral suasion in school discipline is being carried to 
excess. The following will be more or less interesting according to readers’ views 
upon the subject: 
“Ts it not possible that the increasing number of incorrigibles may bear some 
relation to this sentimentality? I know that I am terribly heterodox in even sug- 
gesting that a good sound thrashing occasionally would be of more benefit to a 
capricious, spunky youngster than all the goody-goody talks so correctly advocated. 
We are getting too many mama’s pets and Lord Fauntleroys, and I fear our system 
has a tendency to perpetuate it. Give us more good, healthy, moral discipline; more 
Sanfords and Mertons and Tom Browns.” Some other very plain things are said 
upon the unreasonableness and injustice of exacting of teachers, by use solely of 
suasion, to reform and refine boys upon whom discipline at home has had no such 
influence. 
The superintendent appeals earnestly for such added appropriations as will sup- 
ply the great want of sufficient school accommodations for pupils, whose annual 
increase in numbers is 2,500. The high schools are specially lacking in this respect. 
The report admits that the expenses in running the night schools have been fol- 
lowed by only meager results, and it recommends that ‘‘a few schools judiciously 
located, with a course of study involving some of the features of a higher education, 
be opened for the coming year.” = 
The report contends that a kindergarten department should be attached to every 
school, arguing that in that-case the great length of time justly complained of being 
spent at school would be materially shortened. é 
Enrollment of pupils for-1895-96 was 34,756; an increase from last year of 1,919. 
MINNESOTA. 
Report for 1895-96, Hon. W. W. Pendergast, State superintendent. 
The teachers’ reading circles have increased to the degree that they are now in 
nearly every county in the State, reaching even to several far outlying districts. 
The system of issuing certificates for work done therein has served to stimulate 
emulation. 
The growth of school libraries has been notable, the volumes of 185,400 in 1894 
having increased in 1896 to 336,806. This increase, though most striking in wealthy 
communities, has yet been going on constantly in almost every county, and efforts 
are made to extend it to remotest and least favored sections. 
The free text-book system has increased greatly in favor and production of good 
results. : 
“Within two years after the passage of. the law nearly one-half the district 
throughout the State have fallen into line, while at the present time not Jess than 60 
per cent of all districts are loaning text-books to pupils free of charge, and always 
with the most marked satisfaction. In fact, it appears to be a matter of only a short 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
   306 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97.     time when all of our districts will have abandoned the custom of selling at cost and 
be enjoying the benefits that follow the adoption of the free text-book plan.” 
Under the system of local option it seems impracticable to establish uniformity of 
these text-books, as is so earnestly desired by superintendents generally. 
Teachers’ institutes, after having accomplished much good, have been gradually 
giving way during the last three years to those more energetic institutions—the 
summer schools. The latter tend far to supplement the normal schools, whose accom- 
modations are for numbers far below those in need of them. They bring to every 
county competent educators, who give judicious courses of study that are adapted to 
the various individual and sectional conditions. 
‘These schools have become of so serious importance, that many superintendents 
have seen fit to limit to 16 years the age of attendants. Despite several inequalities 
attending the operations thus far, the judgment in their favor has become general 
with county superintendents, boards of education, boards of trustees, and teachers. 
The rural schools are reported to have made much progress during the two years 
last past. The report says: 
“The stronger educational spirit pervading the rural portions of the State is 
another unmistakable evidence of progress. This appears in better buildings, greater 
attention to sanitary conditions, tree planting and otherwise beautifying the school 
grounds, improved appliances, free libraries and text-books, appreciation of and 
demand for professional teachers.” 
A notable increase in libraries also has gone on within this period and in books. 
These now average 60 volumes in 1,853 libraries. 
The report suggests that the labors of the county superintendent in many cases are 
disproportionately onerous. In some counties they have over seventy schools, visi- 
tations to which require much time and considerable sacrifice. 
Benefits are already manifest in the operation of the law empowering the high- 
school board to extend aid, under prescribed conditions, to village and town graded 
schools below that rank. 
The prevalence of many small schools, it is suggested, can be remedied only by 
adoption of the township system. As the legislature does not yet decide for this, it 
is recommended to ‘‘stop dividing districts which have no more pupils than can be 
advantageously taught in one school, and to unite very small contiguous ones where 
it can be done without great inconvenience to the most distant pupils. It is fre- 
quently the case that those who live farthest off can be conveyed to and from school 
in the winter at much less expense than that of maintaining a separate school.” 
Regarding the charge made by some that the high schools under the present system 
are mere stepping stones to the university, it is suggested that a change in their 
curricula be made and they do different work from that specially designed to fit for 
the university. 
Work in the normal schools constantly grows more important. Their enrollment 
has greatly increased, and they are counted upon to do far more than any other class 
of institutions to lift the primary schools to a proper plane. They are counseled, 
however, not to make their instruction conform to that of the high school, the aims 
of both being entirely different. Normal schools, when rightly conducted, enablo 
teachers to make effective the drill which will fit pupils for the high sehools. An act 
of the legislature of 1895 providing for normal instruction in high schools has been 
disappointing to its advocates, only five having adopted it. It is claimed, however, 
that in these results have been satisfactory. There seems to be some defects for 
which the report suggests a number of changes, as that those who intend to teach 
without going through the university shall devote the third and fourth years of the 
high schools to more training in common branches than that given in the grammar 
schools and that a year’s work in teaching take tho place of one of the preparatory 
high schools. 
The university grows with noted rapidity, numbering 2,467 students, with 241 
professors. 
Notwithstanding the praise bestowed by the report on the continually improving 
condition of free education it disavows entire satisfaction, admitting that in many 
respects there is essential need of amendment, as in a more proper preparation of 
teachers, in improved methods of school supervision, in so ordering that teachers 
who are found to be competent in all points are so treated and paid that their 
services can be longer retained. Thoughtful suggestions are made upon meetings of 
teachers and superintendents. 
ST. PAUL SCHOOL REPORT, 
Report for 1894-95, C. B. Gilbert, superintendent to the board of school inspectors. 
It is unfortunate that, owing to the reduction in the budget by the city council, 
teachers’ salaries had to be somewhat lowered. Notwithstanding this, however, it 
is claimed for them that their work has been done with undiminished earnestness 
and efficiency. 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
MINNESOTA. 1307 - 
At some length is argued the necessity that teachers should be continually looked after and instructed in the art of teaching. 
The superintendent contends it is a mistake that school finances are not entirely controlled by the board of inspectors, but are liable to supervision and revision of another board who are elected for another purpose and are not acquainted with educational systems. 
‘The report has some observations upon correlation, in which, admitting its impor- tance to a degree, it stops short of the extent to which it is carried by some of the disciples of Herbart. It also discusses the two tendencies in kindergartens—one toward formalism and the other toward freedom—and warns against too close 
adherence to unimportant details. 
In the schools here, as in several other States and cities, a very decided trend toward vertical penmanship is noticeable. 
The work of the Mechanic Arts High School and the Teachers’ Training School is much commended, but serious remonstrance is made against too many subjects being studied daily in the high schools, which leave little time to students for use ‘of library or counseling with teachers. Much regret is expressed for the fact that financial conditions hinder furnishing free text-books. 
The following extract tells of a plan devised during emergency: 
“The plan that was authorized by this board, and carried out for a short time 
during the last year, of allowing the children to make a fixed contribution of money to be spent for books, which books belong to the school, was an excellent one. In some schools it worked marvelous changes. The enthusiasm of the children over the abundance of new reading matter was great. In one building, where the chil- 
dren had heretofore been starved upon a single reader, the various classes read dif- 
ferent books, varying from 6 to 15 innumber. No better commentary is possible. The complaints were few, and came mainly from those people who never buy any 
books and from certain publishers whose books were not bought as much as hereto- 
fore.” 
This plan, however, the board thought best to do away with, and another is now 
being considered. 
Some additions have been made to existing school buildings, and one new one has 
been erected. The supply, however, is far below pressing neods, which, under 
present laws regulating appropriations, have little promise of being fully met. 
‘The number of pupils enrolled is 21,276, who are taught by 502 teachers. 
Besides tables of statistics in the work of the whole system, the report contains a 
copy of the act abolishing the board of education and creating the board of school 
inspectors. - 
1895-96. 
The report to July 1, 1896, is from the same superintendent, C. B. Gilbert, esq. 
‘The report makes complaint of the great lack of material. These are some of its 
words: 
“We greatly need more material for our work. Our course of study is broad, and, 
if properly administered by good teachers, means such an education for children as 
shall fit them for complete living, but in order that the greatest benefit may be 
derived from it a considerable amount of material of various sorts must be supplied. 
We especially need more books; good literature for children. This need isimperative. 
Wo get a little each year from the State, butit is not enough.” 
The board have decided to promise free text-books, in trust that necessary funds 
will be supplied. Another decision is regarding supervision. It is that in buildings 
with not more than nine reoms principals be relieved of supervision, for which a 
separate supervisor is appointed. 
Manual training is doing so well that it is recommended for the primary grades, 
We copy the following extract under the head ‘High schools:” 
“Tho most noteworthy features of the high-school department of our system this 
year have been the development of the minor schools and the creation and growth 
of the Mechanic Arts School. The Cleveland and Humboldt have each completed 
the junior year and in 1897 will graduate their first classes. . . . The Mechanic Arts 
School has had a fine year and graduated its first class in June.” 
Work in elementary English needs modification, better preparation being desirable 
for their entrance into high schools. Some enlargement of plan has taken place in 
the Teachers’ Training School, in the matters of more practical surroundings and 
more systematic child study. Graduates have no difficulty in finding employment, 
such is the constant demand for them. 
While the lack of sufficient school accommodations has been partially relieved, 
there is still much more needed. ¥ 
The number of teachers grew to 528, and of pupils enrolled in day schools to 22,329,

  1308 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
MINNEAPOLIS SCHOOL REPORT. 
The report for the year 1895 is from Charles M. Jordan, superintendent of schools, 
and it is preceded by an address to the board of education by M. Falk Gjertsen, its 
president. . 
In the latter claim is made that the system of high schools is better and their 
enrollment greater than those in any other city in the Union of similar size, the 
four now existing containing over 2,200 pupils. 
For want of adequate funds for new buildings the schools have been crowded to 
a degree that is regarded a municipal calamity. Whatever was possible to be done 
for the overflow of pupils was accomplished by building annexes, and also by 
renting. The board were unable to obtain but 3 mills for the 4 mills tax to which 
it claims to have been entitled, and in vain sought issuance of bonds with which 
to meet emergencies. 
The president refers with becoming pride to the enhanced care and adornment of 
late bestowed upon school grounds, the excellent orderly discipline by which prin- 
cipals control and. conduct their classes, even in the evening schools. 
The superintendent, after giving a statement of the various shifts made for obtain- 
ment of adequate room, by additions, etce., makes an urgent appeal for greater 
accommodations. He says: 
“During the latter part of the year just closed at least 1,100 pupils were unable 
to attend school more than half of each day, om account of the lack of accommo- 
dations. Some pupils, to iny personal knowledge, have not had a full day at school 
since they first entered in September, 1893. Others have spent all their school days 
thus far in annexes. There are some basement rooms yet remaining which will be 
suitable for school purposes. While they were not intended for schoolrooms, and 
are not in all respects fitted for the purpose, they are nevertheless much better than ~ 
the ordinary annex which the board is now using. One thing is evident, that new 
school buildings are imperatively needed, and that they must be had in some way if 
the best work is done in the schools.” 
The pupils in day schools for the year numbered 29,623, an increase of 1,537. The 
increase of attendance was gratifying, being 97 per cent. 
Cordial satisfaction is expressed at the operation of the rule abolishing written 
examinations as the sole tests for promotion. As cordial is that for the change 
requiring the teaching of vertical penmanship, which, it is confidently claimed, has 
been shown to be the best. 
Much good has resulted from the Teachers’ Library, toward whose support in the 
last year $300 was contributed. The superintendent earnestly recommends that 
steps be early taken to furnish to all of the schools reference libraries. The fund 
for the support of high schools has indeed been such as to allow diversion of a por- 
tion in that way, but it has not been possible to do the like for the graded schools. 
Evening schools have been kept during sixty-seven weeks, with an enrollment of 
1,326. 3 
  1896. 
The report for 1896 is from the same officials as last year. 
The report of the president offers felicitations on the universally popular interest 
in the schools. We give the following extract: 
“There are few if any cities outside of Minneapolis that can show au enrollment 
of 37,340 children in the schools to a population of 200,000, and it is a noticeable and 
encouraging fact that the business stringency, with its hardships for laboring classes, 
has in no way diminished their interest in the schools.” 
Most marked advancement has been in the industrial branches, The sloyd system 
has been advanced until it is now employed in the eighth grade, so that there is a 
continual course from the fourth through to the high school. 
While several new buildings have been constructed, there is yet a deplorable lack 
of sufficient accommodations in the south and southwest, where large num- 
bers of children are put in basements on double sessions, while the schools are much 
overcrowded. 
In the report of the superintendent, this crowded condition, increasing constantly 
on account of increase of pupils, is dwelt upon at length and in detail. This increase 
for the last year has been confined to the second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, and 
eighth grades, whereas decrease has been in the first and fifth grades and in the high 
school. Notwithstanding the unusual prevalence of sickness among children, attend- 
ance has been $7 per cent, the same as last year. 
Sewing is now taught in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades, and there is a continu- 
ous course from the fourth to the eighth grades, inclusive, for girls ia domestic econ- 
omy, and in the seventh and eighth for cooking, for which last there are three schools 
attached—the Adams, Blaine, and Winthrop.  
-P-A-G-E-181
MINNESOTA—MISSOURI. 1309 
Appeal is made for larger libraries for schools. The Teachers’ Library, with over 
6,000 volumes, is doing much good. 
Time serves to strengthen the favor with which free text-books are regarded, 
For trial of the two systems of penmanship, the vertical and the slanting, six 
schools were assigned to the former and the remainder to the latter. The decisionis 
heartily in favor of the vertical. 
Evening schools are increasing in favor and attendance, as from year to year they 
are coming to reach children of school age, a very decided preponderance of attend- 
ance heretofore being of those over 21 years of age. 
MISSOURI. 
Report for 1895, Hon. John R. Kirk, superintendent of public schools. 
It opens with an urgent appeal for more care in the construction of schoolhouses 
and laying off school grounds with a view to sanitation, convenience, and taste. 
Already city schools have recognized the importance of employing skilled archi- 
tects to plan and oversee such work, and, besides the construction of new buildings, 
have gotten their services in the remodeling of such of the old as were susceptible 
of it. The case is unfortunately different in rural schoolhouses, which have been 
constructed mainly by cheap rural carpenters who have never even seen such a 
building that was constructed after modern methods. The superintendent visited 
as many as two hundred of these houses widely scattered, from the borders of Iowa 
to those of Arkansas, and he thus writes of them: 
“With these evidences of existing conditions the conclusion is unavoidable that 
the children of the State are suffering enormous loss as to bodily health, strength, 
and vigor because of the unsanitary condition of our rural schoolhouses.” 
It is no comfort, the report argues, that the condition in Missouri in that respect 
is no worse than in many other States or that it is better than in some of them. 
This is not due to parsimoniousness in the people, but to want of intelligence in the 
investment of the liberal appropriations granted for the purpose. Any well-built 
schoolhouse can be sufficiently ventilated at a small cost, and only carefulness and 
some knowledge of the means are needed to make it so. 
It is a matter of congratulation that the prominence taken by education in the 
mind of the public has wrought vast good, and in this special respect, that it is 
impossible for any one or more leaders of opinion to spring a system upon the people 
with expectation of its being adopted until they, who are to be responsible for it 
and affected by it, have had time and leisure to consider it. The report points with 
pride to the State University, the State normal school, to county teachers’ institutes, 
to the multiplication of private schools and colleges, and the already 400 towns in 
the State that are aiming to establish high schools. ‘‘How,” says the report, “to 
correlate, unify, and strengthen these institutions is a problem vast enough.” 
The first suggestion as to needed legislation made by the report is a system of 
more careful inspection and supervision of all rural schools. The superintendent, 
after making himself acquainted thoroughly with the conditions and methods of 
many of these, particularly in the southwestern section of the State, cites one county 
especially in order to show how schools could be bettered by the use of proper care. 
This county is Jasper, the condition of whose schools is incomparably superior to 
that of those in the adjacent counties, and this is the cause of the difference: 
“There is in that county an enthusiasm, a professional spirit, a standard of scholar- 
ship, an effectiveness of work done with which the schools of adjoining counties 
can not compare. But Jasper County has a man in the field every year. For two 
years or more she has done this. The county superintendents have been energetic, 
enthusiastic, professional teachers, ambitious young men who got out of town and 
worked. The schools of Jasper County are a monument to the intelligence of her 
superintendents and teachers, and to the progressive spirit of the people.” 
The report urges action on the part of the legislature for the efficient care of the 
feeble-minded children of the State, whose number is calculated to be about 3,000. 
The report highly praises the efforts of the university to secure “articulation” 
with the secondary schools. Last year the legislature appropriated $4,000 for the 
University Summer School of Science, and great good has resulted in the importa- 
tion of instruction to the high-school teachers. This instruction is given both by 
the university professors and by skilled specialists in high-school work. Harm has 
been done, the report says, by confused conception of high-school work as distinct 
from the work of colleges, and it is contended that there are sixty or seventy insti- 
tutions in the State called colleges whose names ought to be those of academies or 
private high schools. 
While admitting that the work in the normal schools has been of great benefit, 
there are some things yet the report considers needed. It says, ‘‘Every normal 
   
-P-A-G-E-182
     EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
sehvol should have a pedagogical laboratory. By this is meant a laboratory in the 
form of a model graded school of fifteen or twenty children in each grade, begin- 
ning, of course, with the kindergarten.” 
1896. - 
The report for the year 1896 is from the same superintendent. It begins with an 
earnest, thoughtful argument in favor of industrial education, answering the objec- 
tions of those who are wont to style schools for that purpose as ‘shop schools,” 
“trade schools,” and ‘cooking schools.” It cites the fact that prejudices have been 
so far overcome that work on a liberal scale has already been begun in the State 
University, and in Kansas City and other places. 
“Manual training has the indorsement of our State University, as shown by pro- 
visions for certain classes of its students; the second largest city of the State puts 
about $200,000 into a manual training high school. ‘The manual training school of 
Washington University has long been well and favorably known; the indastrial 
department of Lincoln University has cordial and general indorsement.” 
Attention is directed to the greater progress in “form of such education that has 
been made in several other States when it has been established in institutions below 
high schools, beginning with the kindergarten. It is admitted that in rural schools 
such training has neither the same purpose nor the same necessity, yet there are things 
in which it would be found of much importance to tho children of farmers, such as 
elementary principles that relate.to the source, character, and reproduction of soils, 
and rotation of crops. They might easily have what ought to be known of the plant- 
ing of trees, vegetables and flowers, the grafting of fruit trees, the care needed in 
their raising, the habits of noxious insectsand the means of arresting their incursions. 
Then it is recommended that more instruction be given in the geography, fauna, and 
flora, not only of the State, but of other States and foreign countries. These would 
have, besides the valuable knowledge obtained, much greater influence than many 
suppose on mental development.. An interesting report is given of the Kansas City 
Manual Training School. In that oceur the following words, taken from a recent 
United. States. Government report, by Dr. C. M. Woodward: 
“Manual training as an educational factor owes its existenee to a widespread con- 
vietion that the education of the school has been dealing too exclusively with the 
abstract and remote, and not enough with the conerete and present,” and there is 
given this statement regarding the aim of that institution, which is declared to be 
“to prepare students of both sexes for the practical duties of life; tofarnish a train- 
ing of head and hand, useful alike to all classes, regardless of future occupation, and 
fit for entrance into modern courses of the best universities. Itisnotatradeschool.” 
~ The report deals with much plainness of the vastly unsatisfactory condition of 
rural schools. ‘The following are some of the statements-in this behalf: 
“ Missouri has over 9,000 one-room sehoolhouses, each one under control of three 
directors—more than. 9,000 separate independent school districts with more than 
27,000 schcol directors, and these. directors too often elected without regard to 
the fitness for position.” 
It may well be supposed that the argument against such a state of things is to the 
point. 
On tho subject of county institutes, the report declares that they are becoming 
slowly more useful as their importance becomes as slowly studied and appreciated. 
After setting down what are and what are not their purposes, it emphasizes the fact 
that these are wholly pedagogical, and until this truth becomes settled in men’s 
opinions not very much of benefit is to. be expected from the work done at their 
sessions. 
The report is equally plain in discussing colleges so styled, and urgently asks that 
those which have much of the work of the mere academy should work for separation 
fromit. In its opinion no college can. exist, except in name, which is dependent 
upon tuition fees alone, and which has not an income-produecing endowment of at 
least $100,000. 
The report, however, speaks with pride of the five State institutions which are 
well organized and well equipped. ‘The State University, the three State normal 
schools, and the Lineoln Institute for colored people. ‘The first, during the last five 
years particularly, has. been growing with great rapidity. The creation of the office 
of high-school examiners. is. looked upon as of much importance, promising to con- 
tribute to bring the high schools into more definite relation with the university and 
with others above them. Gratifying accounts come from Lincoln Institute and the 
three normal schools. Of that at Warrensburg the report says: 
“The board of regents last June established a chair of pedagogy. . . . This will 
enable us to concentrate the work of the course under one management, instead of 
farming it out among the teachers of other departments.”

KANSAS CITY SCHOOL REPORT. 
The report for the year 1896 opened with an address to the people of the district 
by R. L. Yeager, president of the board of education, followed by a report from 
J. Ee cee arrons superintendent, to which is appended returns of subordinate 
officials. 
The address says that the amount raised by taxation for school purposes has not 
been adequate for the rapidly increasing needs of accommodations. During the year 
as many as forty-six additional rooms have been employed, and at the time of sub- 
mitting the superintendent’s report the schoolrooms were yet as crowded as ever. 
+ It is earnestly desired to begin with manual training ; the ground has been secured 
for the purpose, and it is hoped that the buildings will be ready for occupation by 
the end of 1897. The same is the case with the coming library building. 
The following extract is from the observations concerning politics on school 
boards : 
“Tt is a fact that in many places movements are being made toward non, or 
bipartisan and nonsectarian boards of education, while in quite a number of places 
such school boards have already been organized. ‘This is as it should be, as by no 
other methods can school work be so well performed. The death knell has been 
sounded, we believe, to political boards.” 
The first movement toward kindergartens was not a success ; yet the feeling in its 
favor has become so general that the board has decided to make another trial, which 
if successful will lead to general establishment of such schools throughout the city. 
‘The Central High School, with its 1,800 pupils, is greatly overcrowded, but some 
relief is expected from the opening of the manual training school next year. 
Much praise is bestowed upon the Lincoln High School for colored people. It was 
hampered for several years by the difficulty of obtaining competent colored teachers. 
This has at last been overcome, and the instruction is rapidly advancing in satisfac- 
tory, benign work. 
The report indulges at much length in observations on many subjects, as the school 
and citizenship, the principal and the teacher, suggestions to principals on.manage- 
ment, etc. It admits that more rapid improvement is needed in many schools. The 
following paragraph concerning enrollment, attendance, etc., we give: 
“The total enrollment for the year is 20,008, a gain of 819 over last year’s total 
enrollment. Tho average number belonging is 15,286, also a gain of 667 over last 
year, and the average daily attendance is 14,535, a gain of 770 over last year, while 
the teaching force remained practically the same.” 
School children are allowed very generous privileges in the public library. What 
is called a children’s room has been set apart for several years for advanced pupils. 
These facilities are to be larger in the coming new library, and that special depart- 
ment is to be presided over by a librarian who has become thoroughly acquainted 
with all varieties of child literature. ; 
ST. LOUIS SCHOOL REPORT. 
Tho report ending in June, 1895, is made by F. W. Brockman, president of the 
school board organization, followed by one from F. Louis Soldan, superintendent. 
Very large expenditures of school funds were made during the year, owing to 
peculiar circumstances. ‘There has been anotable shifting of population toward the 
west, northwest, and southwest, so rapid as to be quite in advance of the means 
accruing for the provision of school facilities. As current revenues were not at all 
sufficient, it was decided to sell a part of what is known as the permanent fund 
property, rather than submis the citizens to additional tax during a period of unusual 
financial exigency. - 
Enrollment of school children in day schools during the year was 70,428, with 
average of attendance of 51,014 and seating capacity of 59,668 seats. As many as 
eight night schools were held from October to March, two of which were for colored 
pupils, whose attendance was over 2,000. The showing for kindergartens is good, 
being connected with fifty-four of the schools. We subjoin the following under the 
head “ Teachers’ relief fund:” 
“At the biennial session of the legislature of this State, held this year, the act 
creating the fund for the relief of the sick and superannuated teachers was passed. 
. . . The Teachers’ Aid Association has labored many years in this noble work, and 
by the act of the legislature its hopes have been erowned with success... . It is 
to be regretted that the law could not be made so as to require aspecific tax for the 
purpose, but under the circumstances all was done that could possibly be accom- 
lished.” 
e Notable attention is given to sanitation in the schools of St. Louis, the regulations 
as to which require much circumspection on the part of teachers both in school 
time and during the hours of recreation.

  312 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Regarding promotions of teachers, a change has been made from the old system, 
by which ranking positions are filled in the schools wherein the vacancy occurs and 
not by transfer to others. These take place, twice a year, in October and February. 
There are also two examinations a year for principals, or those applying for positions 
in the high school, the latter of which has the threefold end of finishing the educa- 
tion begun in the primary schools, fitting for entrance into college, though the num- 
ber is but a small fraction of the whole, and giving professional training to women 
intending to teach. At present the normal school is embodied in the high school, 
and will so remain until 1897, when the last class will have graduated. 
Considerable space is given to courses of study and discipline in all the schools, to 
the school for the deaf, and the colored schools, notably the Sumner High School 
and manual training. 
A new course of study has been introduced, the features of which, in the words 
of the superintendent’s report, are: 
“Conversational lessons on conduct and general ethical subjects, the selection of 
specific topics for instruction in natural science, the reference by book and page to 
supplementary reading in geography, and the selection of ‘memory gems’ for each 
quarter and grade.” 
MONTANA. 
Report for 1805-96, Hon. E. A. Steore, State superintendent. 
The report remarks upon the excellent results of the new school law, on which 
cheerful hopes had been set by those who prepared it. Some teachers, it is true, 
have dropped off, but they were such as were expected and desired to do so from 
inability to cope with the new requirements for certificates. The advances in many 
respects have been constant. 
Yet the fact still remains, to the regret of all, that there is a large number of 
children in the State who do not attend schools of any sort. ‘The report is pronounced 
in its recommendation of means to lessen this misfortune, Itsays, among many other 
things: 
fg eaclouely recommend that a law be created to prevent any child under 14 years 
of age from being employed in any mill, factory, business house, messenger, or in any 
business whatever that would employ them during school. In fact, I would like to 
see children under 14 prevented from being employed as messengers at any time. 
This business necessarily leads them into all resorts of vice and thus makes them 
familiar with crime at an early age. . . . Just so Jong as we allow child labor, we 
shall have an uneducated class, and thus unprincipled men and women.” 
Other earnest pointed things on the subject are in the report. 
Appeal for free text-books is again earnestly put forth. It has been hindered thus 
far by consideration of expense; but it is contended that after the first outlay this 
would be reduced within limits easy to be borne. 
‘The normal school has not yet been completed. Itis to be a very imposing building 
and the report trusts thatit will be provided with funds adequate forits various needs. 
In the lack of such an institution, teachers’ institutes have been doing what they could 
in the matter of assisting young teachers in preparation for their work in schools. 
But the short time during which they are held and the great number of subjects dis- 
cussed keep such assistance from being of very considerable value. Slight as has 
been the change in the new law—raising the sessions from three days to five—even 
that has been attended with manifestly enhanced benefit, The principal lack here- 
tofore has been of capable instructors. County superintendents, generally without 
much experience, rely upon the State superintendent, with whom it is not always 
possible to spend five days at everyone of these gatherings, twenty-three in number. 
It is recommended that all county superintendents, wherever it is possible, be 
required to hold institutes or summer normal schools of two weeks in the summer 
vacation, and it is suggested that several others be held at notable places, beginning 
with the university, which has already taken steps toward that end. 
A favorable account is given of the State School of Mines. 
The University of Montana was opened in September, 1895. Attendance, 135 for the 
first year, made satisfactory increase in 1896, Excellent results, it is claimed, have 
followed the action of the State board of education last year in establisting several 
accredited high schools. 
NEBRASKA. 
Report for 1895-96, Hon, H. R. Corbett, State superintendent. 
High praise is bestowed upon the law passed since the last report, providing for 
free attendance at public high schools, completing the system of free education in 
the common and high schools and the university. Pupils may attend high schools
-P-A-G-E-185
  NEBRASKA. 1313 
in a county not their own when more convenient, the tuition of 50 cents a week to 
be paid by the latter. 
The ambition of some principals and school boards unfortunately leads to the 
undertaking of more high-school work than their districts could afford. The new 
law discourages such action, by fixing within definite limits the high-school work for 
every school; a plan which was approved by the university authorities. ‘The law 
provided by special examination for entrance into high schools of those without 
certificates from lower institutions. The consequence of all has been a largely 
increased attendance. The general operation will be made more easy by the forth- 
coming course of study for*’country and village schools by the State superintendent 
with help of a committee of county superintendents named by the teachers” 
* association. 
The report claims that Nebraska has two laws which are in no other State. One 
providing for ‘district ownership of text-books” and the “free attendance of non- 
resident pupils at public high schools.” Specification of the former particularly are 
given in sufficient detail. Both laws were submitted by the superintendent in cir- 
culars to the people resident in the several districts,and the answers are that a 
decided majority favor them. The report recognizes that the new law will serve to 
‘bridge the last gap” in the school system, by securing to children in rural districts 
the same facilities of education in high schools as are enjoyed by those in cities and 
towns. 
The report appeals strongly for the increase of salaries in the teaching force. 
Economy in this should be put behind that in almost every other department of the 
public service. Liberality serves not only to secure competent officials, but renders 
their work both more efficient and more cheerful, by imparting consciousness of 
receiving reasonable compensation for faithful service and rendering the occupation 
more nearly permanent. 
Comment is made upon the teachers’ institutes. Their financial condition is good, 
from the liberal allowances in their favor, yet there seem to be serious defects, grow- 
ing out of the manner in which their prominent officials are appointed. The county 
superintendent acts as conductor, selects the instructors, and undertakes the whole 
management. Hereim are occasionally, fortunately not often, to be seen evidences 
of action ‘determined by personal friendship and political obligation.” Then his 
acquaintance among teachers, except in his own county, is often very limited, a 
matter which disqualifies for intelligent selection. It is recommended that institute 
instructors should obtain certificates from a State board of examiners. 
Summer schools have increased greatly in favor and attendance. Confidence im 
their value has served to bring on establishment of several by private initiative. A 
large list is appended. In particular, that of the university is highly praised, both 
on account of the efficiency of the work done and of the fact that, no provision hay- 
ing been made for expenses, such work is done with little or no compensation. 
The superintendent, with much seriousness, urges again, under the head ‘‘Normak 
training,” the crying need of greater competency among teachers, which can be 
gotten, if not only, at least mainly, in training institutions. Of the 8,843 teachers 
attending institutes in 1895 only 2,051 had attended normal schools of some kind, 
while what training was received by the others was gotten at institutes. The State 
Normal School has advanced at all points. The unfortunate dissensions some time 
back, which grew mainly out of political complications, have been healed to a degree 
through the influence of the State board of education acting in harmony with the 
governor. The faculty work more in harmony, and attendance is constantly 
increased. In this bettered condition it will become incumbent upon the legislature 
to make necessary appropriation. 
Mention is made of State examinations and certificates, State and normal diplomas, 
county superintendents’ meetings (for whose time and expenses compensation should 
be made), meetings by districts, the common-school course of study, temperance 
instruction, the free high-school attendance law, and the high-school system, in 
which, within the last two years, has been developed a more systematic relation 
among those constituting it to the State department and to the university, all this 
“being due to the new school law of 1895. The report maintains that the number of 
high schools which prepare fully for the university should be small, but that those 
students who have completed the course in smaller schools should have free access: 
to them when desirous of preparing themselves for the university. If it be allowed 
to graded high schools to give such preparation, the university must suffer from 
doing much of high-school work, and the communities in which they are situate 
be overburdened by the support of a school course unnecessarily prolonged. 
         
OMAHA SCHOOL REPORT. 
The report for the year 1896 begins with an address before the board of education 
by Ira O. Rhoades, its president, followed by the report of Carroll G. Pearse, super-_ 
intendent of instruction, to which is appended those from lower officials. 
ED 97. 83   
 
-P-A-G-E-186
   314 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
In the president’s address allusion is made to the large increase in enrollment and 
attendance and the large decrease in resources. In the year 1891-92 the average of 
attendance of pupils was 10,370 and the resources of the board were $459,598.62, of 
which $249,000 was derived from saloon licenses. These figures have been changing 
during the period until now, when the average attendance of pupils is 12,630 and the 
revenues $355,945.55, of which $195,000 came from saloon licenses. The complaint 
made by some that too high salaries are paid to teachers is flatly denied by the pres- 
ident. Cheap salaries obtain inefficient teachers; yet these are lower here than the 
average in other cities. It says: 
‘““Without quoting statistics which are a matter of record, I need only refer you 
to the salaries paid in cities of our size which proves that we are not only paying 
lower salaries, but that we are even far below the average. Especially is this so 
with regard to the salaries paid for supervision. Cities like Kansas City are paying 
principals of sixteen-room buildings $1,800 per year, while we pay but $1,400.” 
The normal training school is reported to be doing great good, but it seems hard 
that its graduates “ under the rules,” as expressed in the address, get smaller salaries 
than are paid to teachers employed from other cities. 
, The report recommends that arrangements should be made for daily visits by 
superintendents to the manual training department. Even as it is it has been doing 
excellently well. 
The kindergartens have met considerable opposition. Says the report: 
“They have been called fads, nurseries, etc., and the school board accused of sup- 
plying amusements for babies under school age. The kindergarten system is no 
Jonger an experiment, and it never was a fad. No children are admitted until they 
have reached the school age. If kindergartens were not provided for them, we would 
be obliged to open new first grades, employing higher paid teachers, fitting rooms 
with desks, ete., all of which would make an additional cost over the kindergarten.” 
Yet the address thinks that it was a mistake to open so large a number in the 
beginning. Hereafter care should be taken that the work in them be such that will 
assist the pupil in the work of the lowest grades, and be made part of them instead 
of kept separate as in this city. 
The address recommends adoption by the board of civil-service rules regarding 
teachers who have had satisfactory experience, instead of having them subjected as 
now to the chances of re-election every year. 
In view of increase of pupils and diminution of incomes, an earnest appeal is made 
to the city council to raise the levy of taxation in order to provide for this ever- 
growing need of greater resources. As it is, kindergartens and the lowest school 
grades do not enjoy full day sessions. It is admitted, however, that a mistake in 
economy was made in erecting so many small schoolhouses instead of a few large 
ones in the beginning. Some natural pride is indulged by an action of the board in 
1894 whereby an insurance fund was created whose income has been invested in 
interest-paying warrants, 
Experiment with vertical penmanship seems to have proven its decisive superiority. 
  NEVADA. 
Report for 1895 and 1896, Hon. H. C. Cutting, superintendent of public instruction. 
It proceeds in the beginning with announcement of the general inefliciency of the 
laws regulating the State educational system: 
“The laws governing our schools are very defective, unintelligible, and weak. 
There are many good points in them, as every legislature since the first has amended 
them, but there is no system to our school laws and none to ourschools. Many of 
our laws are unconstitutional, others are obsolete, and there is hardly one on the 
statute book that can be enforced.” 
The present superintendent prepared a system of laws upon the subject to be sub- 
mitted to the legislature of 1897. At a teachers’ institute held at Elko in December 
last the law, with certain changes substituted by the members, was agreed to be 
submitted, and good hopes were indulged of its passage. This law provides that 
the four district superintendents be added to the State board of education, making 
that board consist of seven members. It provides for two grades of educational 
and life diplomas, grammar and high school. 
The most important article in the proposed enactment is that regarding district 
superintendents, who now are the same persons with the district attorneys, the 
businesses in the twofold offices being wholly incompatible with each other. The 
plan is to divide the State into four educational districts coextensive with the 
judicial districts, and, after allowing good salaries, to exact faithful work of the 
superintendents. Such a change, the report contends, would systematize school  
-P-A-G-E-187

work greatly and serve to overcome the frequent meddleing with school affairs to 
the great hindrance of their efficient conduct. The report says: 
“There are many districts in this State where a teacher with fifteen or twenty 
pupils is compelled to have from thirty-five to forty classes, as they do not dare to 
grade the school properly for fear of losing their position by offending some of the 
parents. 
: The present method of apportionment of funds on the number of children between 
6 and 18 is characterized as an “‘absolute bid for dishonesty” and has given occasion 
to much dissatisfaction and strife, whereas apportionment according to school 
attendance would place a bounty om punctuality in that respect. 
Regarding care of schovl property the report says: “No care whatever is taken 
of school property, especially in county districts, and the destruction and waste is 
something appalling. . .. Destruction of property is bad enough, but the careless 
and slovenly habit which such negligence fosters and breeds is ten times worse.” 
As in the preceding, earnest appeal is made in behalf of teachers’ institutes. 
By act of the last legislature every county in the State was allowed to erect a 
high school, to be maintained at its own expense. Elko is the one county availing 
itself of this provision. 
Some remarks are made and recommendation: offered on the subject of cheaper 
text-books. The report concludes with commendation of the progress of the State 
University, education for the deaf, dumb, blind, and feeble-minded. 
Noteworthy is the diminishing number of school children. From 10,592 in 1880, 
the year in which it was greatest, it descended in 1896 to 9,089. 
NEW JERSEY. 
THE SESQUICENTENNIAL OF PRINCETON. 
One of the most important events of the year in scholastic circles was the celebra- 
tion by Princeton University of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the 
signing of the original charter issued in the name of the College of New Jersey 
(October 22,1746). The special significance of the anniversary which occupied three 
days, October 20-22 inclusive, lies in the.fact that it was the chosen time for the for- 
mal assumption of the title of university, a name fitly expressing what had beeome 
the actual scope of the work even before Dr. McCosh resigned the presidency of the 
college. The committee of arrangements! which had been for two years elaborating 
their plans kept two points in view, namely, the exposition of past achievements an 
the presentation of the distinctive lines of university life for which the college had 
prepared the way. These conditions were set forth in the addresses of the president 
and members of the faculty, which thus formed the central feature of the three 
days’ celebration.? The accompanying exercises of music, the interchange of greet- 
ings with other universities, the honors to invited delegates, etc., added greatly to 
the interest and impressiveness of the occasion. 
As a preliminary to the sesquicentennial exercises and a recognition of the inter- 
national unity of scholastic pursuits, the week preceding the ceremony was made 
the occasion for several series of lectures by foreign specialists. 
With the exception of the course on the French Revolution and English litera- 
ture, by Prof. Edward Dowden, of Trinity College, Dublin, these lectures were

addressed to specialists, and brought together a bedy of men distinguished in the 
respective lines.! 
The sesquicentennial exercises were held in Alexander Hall, a beautiful building 
in the French Romanesque style, one of the most impressive of the new buildings, 
which illustrate on the material side the recent university ideal. 
The body of the hall was reserved for invited delegates, including the presidents 
of the leading sister universities in our own country and the distinguished repre- 
sentatives of foreign universities. The delegates, numbering from 500 to 700, wore 
their academic robes, which gave a brilliant effect to the scene. 
The principal exercises, in addition to the addresses by President Patton and 
Prof. Woodrow Wilson, here given in full, were the reception to delegates on the 
afternoon of the first day and the exercises attending the formal announcement of 
the university title on the morning of the third day. 
On the former of these occasions Dr. Howard Duffield, of New York City, a son 
of Princeton, welcomed the delegates in an eloquent address. Responses were made 
by President Eliot, of Harvard University, on behalf of American universities and 
learned societies, and by Prof. Joseph John Thompson, of Cambridge University, 
England, on behalf of European universities and learned societies. 
On the morning of October 22, exactly one hundred and fifty years from the date of 
the original charter of the College of New Jersey, Dr. Patton announced that the 
college “shall be known hereafter and forever more as Princeton University.” This 
announcement, which elicited an outburst of applause, was followed by a statement 
as to the endowments that had been secured in anticipation of thisevent. The com- 
pleted list was not ready, so that full details were impossible at the moment, but a 
total of $1,353,291 was reported, with the work of the committce still in continuance, 
When the enthusiasm excited by this showing had subsided the university pro- 
ceeded with its first official act, which was the conferring of the doctor’s degree upon 
a number of men eminent in letters, arts, and science.”

RELIGION AND THE UNIVERSITY. 
A sermon preached in Alexander Hall on the occasion of the sesquicentennial cele- 
bration, October 20, 1896, by Francis L. Patton, president of the College of New 
Jersey. 
(1 Corinthians 1m, 11. For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.) 
The first charter of the College of New Jersey was signed by John Hamilton, 
president of His Majesty’s council, on the 22d day of October, 1746. A second char- 
ter, still more liberal in its provisions, was obtained from Governor Belcher in 1748, 
It was surely the day of small things when a little company of Presbyterians in 
the city of New York and its vicinity interested themselves in establishing a seat 
of learning in the Province of New Jersey as a means of providing a libera i educa- 
tion for young men intending to enter the ministry. The ineffectual efforts which 
they had previously made and their ultimate success bear striking testimony to the 
religious intolerance of the times, the more enlightened policy of President Hamilton 
and Governor Belcher, and the liberal spirit of the founders of the new institution, 
who, though Presbyterians by conviction and actuated in the main by zeal for the 
religious necessities of their own church, accepted without scruple a charter which 
gave no advantage to any denomination, and beyond a scheme for liberal culture 
made no specific provisions for the needs of any profession. 
The spirit of the founders has been kept alive in their successors. The interests 
of the college have always been in the hands of religious men, and of men, I may 
say, belonging as a rule toa particular branch of Protestant Christendom. but it 
has never been under ecclesiastical control. It has served the church and it has 
served the state without in any sense being under the authority of either. The 
founders of the College of New Jersey did not establish a theological school with a 
perparatory department in arts; they established a faculty of arts with an embryonic 
department of theology. There is a great difference between the two methods, and 
this difference has determined the course of Princeton’s subsequent development. 
‘The establishment at a later date in Princeton of a theological school under ecclesi- 
astical control made it unnecessary and unwise to continue theological instruction 
in the college, and trom that time until now the teaching force of the College of 
New Jersey has consisted of a single university faculty of arts. Thanks to the lib- 
eral policy of her founders, thanks also to the wise Christian spirit of those who 
have guided her course, Princeton College, though ever hospitable to new ideas and 
ever ready to recognize ‘new truth, has, throughout her history, been true to the 
spirit of those who founded her, ‘and has never had reason to feel that in any 
instance she has violated her charter, or been unfaithful to the moral obligatious 
imposed by the labors and benefactions of the Christian men who have been inter- 
ested in her welfare. 
Considered in respect to nations and periods that are characterized by immobility, 
the lapse of a hundred and fifty years is not a matter that need call for special com- 
memoration. But in this country the beginning of such a period antedates the 
national life. Princeton shares with her older sisters, Harvard and Yale, the dis- 
tinction of a life coeval with our national independence, and she claims for herself 
a distinction, shared in equal degree by no other institution, of being a large factor 
in the making of the nation. Of the part that Princeton played in the revolutionary 
- struggle; of President Witherspoon, who signed the Declaration of Independence; 
of the Princeton men, and particularly of Madison and Patterson and Oliver Ells- 
worth, who helped to make the Constitution of* the United States; of the meeting 
of the Continental Congress in this place and under the roof of Nassau Hall, you 
will in all probability be told by another speaker on a later occasion. It is enough 
for me, having mentioned these names in connection with the political history of 
the country, to add to them the names of Henry and Guyot in science; of Jonathan 
Edwards and James McCosh in philosophy; of the Alexanders and Hodges in theol- 
ogy, and then to ask if Iam making an empty boast when I say that Princeton has 
won for herself a conspicuous place in the intellectual history of Amer’ 
It has been the aim of those who have governed this institution to make and keep 
it a Christian college. The men who have contributed to its endowment :.nd admin- 
istered its affairs and taught in its class rooms have been Christian men. They 
have been men of deep conviction regarding God and his government, and they have    
     
-P-A-G-E-190
  1318 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
had high ideas respecting their responsibility for the use of time and money. There 
is in the history of the college, in what she has done and in what she has been saved 
from doing, in what she has achieved and in what she has escaped, abundant reason 
for profound gratitude. Filled, then, with these thoughts of the past, and standing 
upon the threshold of a new period in the history of this institution, let us give 
thanks to God for the good that has been done in His name by the men who have 
served it and the men who have gone out from it; and let us pray that to us upon 
whom devolves the responsibility of opening a new era in the educational policy of 
Princeton there may be granted that wisdom which shall save us from mistakes, and 
that grace which shall enable us to use for God’s glory the power and influence that 
are given to us by reason of our place in the organic life of a great institution. 
Our history, as I can not help believing, is also a prophecy. There has been 
ample time in that history for the line of tendency along which we are likely to 
develop to reveal itself, for there is an analogy between the history of an institu- 
tion and the growth of an organism, and growth is recalcitrant to interference from 
witheut. You may shape your block of marble as you will, but you must be con- 
tent to see the process of self-realization go on in the organism according to the 
logic of its inner life. There are universities that are made in obedience to the wills 
of their founders and with no tradition to conserve. They are free to shape their 
policy in unhampered independence of the past. But it is not so with us. We have 
come to be what we are through the slow growth of a hundred and fifty years. 
We have our own ideas of education, which aro in part the result of our experience 
and in part perhaps an expression of our conservatism. We give large place in our 
curriculum to contemporaneous knowledge, but we are unwilling to part with our 
heritage of Hellenic culture. We believe in specialization, but we also believe that 
the student makes a mistake when in his haste to win his spurs in some narrow field 
of inquiry he foregoes the advantage of a broad general education. Intellectual disci- 
pline is good, but it is not so important as high manhood; and eager though we may 
be to turn out from year to year a few men of high intellectual attainment, we deem 
it far more important that the great body of our graduates should be men of moral 
courage and religious convictions, public spirited, patriotic, and possessed of clear, 
balanced, and discriminating judgment in regard to public questions, 
Princeton has a great work to do in science, philosophy, and literature. I have no 
doubt that she will doit well. I hope she will continue to do it in Christian rubrics 
without any loss of moral initiative or religious faith. 
I confess that I am not without my anxieties when I think of the future of our 
American institutions in relation to their religion. I see no reason why I should 
not feel anxiety in regard to Princeton, for we can not hope to escape altogether 
from the operation of the forces that are potent elsewhere. 
I feel inclined to-day, speaking not to Princeton men alone, nor in regard to 
Princeton specifically, to employ the time allotted to me in considering the relation 
of religion to the university. Ido not know of any subject that could more prop- 
erly be considered in a sermon addressed to an academic audience, nor do I know 
of a time when this theme could be more seasonably treated than that whicb is 
given me in connection with these religious services with which we begin our sesqui- 
centennial celebration that is designed 'to commemorate the history of the College of 
New Jersey and to inaugurate Princeton University. 
a 
I cannot better begin what I have to say on this subject than by remindirg you 
of the fact that religion, and by that I mean, of course, the Christian religion, is the 
genetic antecedent of the university. It is true that we cannot impute a distinctively 
religious origin to the universities of Salerno and Bologna, and if we are looking for 
an explanation that will apply equally to all the medieval universities, we must 
pay for our comprehensiveness by being correspondingly vague; and then we can do 
no better than say with Mr. Rashdall that the rise of the university is due to the 
spirit of association that spread over Europe during the middle ages, and that the 
universities were simply guilds of learning. Even then, however, it might be worth 
while to ask whether these guilds as illustrating the fellowship of kindred minds, 
did not receive a new impetus from Christianity, which itself was an expansion of 
the idea of higher kinship as expounded by the Saviour when he said, “Whosoever 
doeth the will of my Father in Heaven, the same is my mother and sister and brother.” 
But whatever be the origin of the Southern universities, those of the North (and 
they are the prototypes of our American colleges and universities) were undoubtedly 
the outgrowth of Christianity. The religion of Christ gave man new ideals. It 
turned them from the quest of pleasure and the love of plunder to a life of contem- 
plation and the pursuit of knowledge. It made them thoughtful, serious and 
reverent. Thinking is also religion, I believe Hegel somewhere says, and whether 
he is right or not, it is certain that the man who takes a serious view of life and has 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
  NEW JERSEY. 1319 
learned to appreciate the deep mystery of being is not far from the place of com- 
munion with God. Christianity popularized philosophy. For the Christian’s creed 
was a metaphysic; and the man who had been taught to believe in creation, the Inear- 
nation, the Trinity, sin and atonement, was obliged in the nature of the case to have 
a very considerable theory of the universe. Many of us, I dare say, remember that 
we took our first lessons in philesophy in the pew, and that we got our first impulse 
to think through the sermon. I believe it is Stevenson who says that there is ‘‘a 
hum of metaphysical divinity about the cradle of every Scot.” There can be little 
doubt, I think, that the religious training of the Scottish people has had much to do 
in making them the metaphysieal people that they are. Christianity has done for 
the world what a particular type of it has done in a more marked way for Scotland. 
It has forced men to think. It has made learning a necessity for all who wish to be 
intelligently informed in regard to religion, and a particular necessity for those who 
were the official expounders of Christianity. The mediwval universities were, for 
the most part, in the hands of the clergy, because they had most need of them and 
could make best use of them; for it must never be forgotten that if to-day there are 
other professions that require quite as much learning as the clerical, there was a time 
when it was the only profession that required any. If now, in addition to what has 
been said, it be remembered that Christianity inculeated philanthropy and high ideas 
~ respecting the duties of citizenship, we shall see how largely, even when it is not con- 
fessed to be such, it enters as a constitutive clement in the making of the modern 
university. The stages of university history can be roughly indicated, though we 
must not press the idea of chronological sequence too far. First came the democratic 
guild of scholars and masters devoting themselves to the study of law as in Bologna, 
or to scholastic divinity as in Paris, and living without endowments or even fixed 
places of abode. Then came the period of endowed foundations—and perhapsit would 
be as well to take William of Wyckeham as a typical example of the great patrons of 
learning, for he, says Mr. Rushdall, ‘‘may be allowed the credit of having been the 
first college founder who required his scholars to say their prayers morning and 
evening and go to chapel daily.” 
Then, in the New World, came the colleges like those in New England, like Prince- 
ton, like Lafayette, like a multitude besides in the Middle and Western States, which 
were the direct outgrowth of Christian philanthropy, and which were established with 
the avowed purpose of giving a liberal education from the Christian point of view. 
Then came the State universities, and, last of all, the triumph of Christian philan- 
thropy in the lavish use of wealth onthe part of men like John C. Green, Johns Hop- 
kins, Ezra Cornell, and John D. Rockefeller for the more complete equipment of 
existing institutions or the establishment of new universities. Now, though the 
circumstances attending the establishment of colleges and universities aro different 
in different cases, and though the religious motive in the establishment of some of 
the more recent universities by private beneficence, and particularly in the estab- 
lishment of universities under control of the State, is not so manifest as in the estab- 
lishment of those which are more directly identified with the religious interests of a 
particular denomination of Christians, I am disposed to give Christianity credit for 
themall. Ihave not yet known of a State university where the profession of atheism 
was regarded as a desirable quality in a professor, and I happen to know of more 
than one State university where a sympathetic attitude toward revealed religion is 
regarded as an essential qualification for a teacher of philosophy. Iam glad to have 
Princeton in that goodly fellowship of American colleges that have been established 
by Christian men and have been built upon Christian foundations. I believe that 
these colleges have done and are still doing a work of priceless value for the Chureh 
and for the State. And yet I sometimes wonder whether more use might not be 
wisely made of the State universities; whether a wise economy of resources, as in 
the newer States, might not suggest such an afliliation of varicus educational inter- 
ests as would serve to throw around young men a distinctly Christian influence and 
at the same time open to them the opportunities of a wide range of study which 
only a large institution can afford to offer. I recognize very distinctly the fact that 
the ranks of the ministry have been recruited very largely from the smaller denom- 
inational colleges, and I must not for a moment be understood as in any sense detract- 
ing from the immense services which those colleges have rendered and have yet to 
render, or as implying that they deserve any but the most liberal support of the 
denominations to which they naturally appeal, when I say that at the present day 
it is a matter of some importance that a very considerable number of those who enter 
the sacred calling should be very intelligently informed in respect to the questions 
now involved in science and philosophy before they enter upon the professional study 
of theology; and that it would be a misfortune if the time should ever come when 
it would be the strong men of the weak colleges and the weak men of the strong 
colleges upon whom we should mainly rely to fill up the rank of the Christian ministry. 
I do not wish, however, to ignore the fact that true though it may be that the uni- 
versities are in a general way the offspring of Christianity, there are universities    
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  1320 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
(and Princeton is one of them) that may be regarded as distinctly Christian mstitu- 
tions, yet they are Christian rather in the conditions of their origin than in the 
contents of their. curricula. Their object is not so much to teach religion as to 
teach science in a religious spirit. It is more in the way they teach than in what 
they teach that they deserve to be called Christian schools. Hence a Christian col- 
lege is not to be judged by the amount of religion that it teaches, or the place it 
assigns to the Scriptures in itscurriculum. In the colleges and universities of which 
I speak, Christianity underlies, informs, unifies, and is the unexpressed postulate of 
all instruction. And this Christian spirit that practically affects teaching without 
<announcing itself, which presupposes Christianity without any irritating self- 
assertion, is on the whole the most effective. Not that itis to be expected that a 
Christian university should be reticent in regard to the truths of religion. Indeed, 
as I shall at present be at pains to show, it can not be. And so it has come to pass 
that the university has had its share of religious controversy. Very naturally; for 
when religion plants a seat of learning and installs the faculty it clearly says that 
religion is ready to be tried by rational tests. The child of the Christian conscious- 
ness, the university by and by becomes its critic. Born of Christianity, the time 
comes when it attains its majority and refuses to remain in ecclesiastical leading 
strings. ‘This may seem ungrateful, but it can not be helped. The necessary con-_ 
sequence of the alliance between religion and the university is the rationalizing of 
religion. It is easy to see that the extremes of tendency are superstition on the one 
hand and infidelity on the other. Ecclesiasticism pure and simple may easily run to 
the one extreme; intellectualism pure and simple may as easily run to the other. 
How to be saved from either may be difficult; but we may be sure that the religion 
which in the last analysis will not bear examination must go down. ‘Credo quia 
impossibile” is not the basis of a sound apologetic, and whether it be Tertullian or 
Mr. Kidd who would have us think so, it can never be rational to believe in an 
irrational religion. 
The rationalizing process may go wrong, but that is no reason why men should 
stop thinking; and a university is a very dead place if the men in it do not think. 
When, therefore, the masters of the University of Paris told the Pope that on a cer- 
tain matter of dogmatic theology they were more competent to speak than he was, 
they were doing exactly what they might have been expected to do, and in doing 
this were the precursors of that movement which put so many of the universities 
of northern Europe on the side of Protestanism and made them the embodiments of 
the spirit of religious independence. When I say that the criticism of religion in 
the university is inevitable, Iam not saying that it is the essence of the university 
that its teachings should be absolutely free. I have nothing to say here by way of 
objection to those universities where absolute freedom teaching is the rule. 
There are universities I know where that absolute freedom would not be allowed. 
So far as Princeton is concerned, I find myself in very agreeable harmony with what 
one of my younger colleagues has said in a recent periodical. ‘‘ Princeton,” says 
Professor Daniels, ‘is definitely and irrevocably committed to Christian ideals. It 
has therefore, with reference to certain primary problems, already taken a definite 
position. It stands for a theistic metaphysic. Nor does it claim or desire any repu- 
tation for impartiality or open-mindedness which is to be purchased by a sacrifice of 
this, its traditional philosophic attitude.” Princeton then, as we are told, “stands 
for a theistic metaphysic.” The critic might say, if he were so disposed, that with 
equal reason it might be made to stand for something less; or might be made 
to stand for something more; and that there is something arbitrary about the 
boundary line that separates the kingdom of fixed belief from that of free discus- 
sion. Now, I venture to say that the weight of the sentence that I have thought 
sufficiently significant to quote lies not so much in what Princeton is said to stand 
for asin the fact that she is said to stand for something; and I can easily believe 
that the exact quantum of belief’ for which Princeton stands may be something 
about which individuals may now differ and may vary from age to age. What 
Princeton stands for really depends upon those who govern her. No matter what 
our origin was; what was believed 150 years ago; what Christian symbol or legend 
we put on the university seal; what moral obligations are imposed by gifts of gen- 
erous benefactors, the exact amount of religious belief that this university will 
stand for can be determined only by the amount of belief that the trustees have 
the moral courage to enunciate in the form of a resolution. That will depend upon 
the state of public opinion; the degree of sensitiveness to public opinion on the 
part of men who hold the places of responsibility, and the amount of strong 
conviction ready for expression at any given time by the governing body. 
This only shows how solemn the responsibility is which rests upon the twenty- 
seven men who control Princeton University. They have power to vote in the 
election of their colleagues, but no power to direct their votes after they take office. 
We have received this institution from a past generation and we hold it with abso- 
lute power of tradition to the next. We can not bind our successors, We may

install them with due solemnity of precatory phrase, but we can not predict or con- 
trol their action. The sacred interests of Princeton are in our keeping. We have 
but a simple duty respecting their transfer to the next generation. St. Paul has 
expressed that duty in his own words to Timothy: ‘‘The things which thou hast 
he: ot me, the same commit thou to the faithful men, who shall be able to teach 
   
ae 
There is another phase of the subject with which we are dealing. It concerns the 
inquiry as to the extent to which religion, and particularly the Christian religion, 
should enter into the curriculum of the university. There are two extreme positions . 
sometimes taken by those who express themselves upon this question. There are 
some who seem to suppose that it is proper and possible to exclude all reference to 
religion and confine the work of university instruction to strictly secular themes. 
Others, again, seem not to realize the changed conditions of university life and sup- 
pose that it is easy to carry on through the entire undergraduate curriculum ascheme 
of enforced religious instruction based upon an accepted type of thought in respect 
to the Bible and revealed religion. I am confident that a more careful study will 
show that both of these positions are wrong, and that nothing requires more wisdom, 
tact, and knowledge of the actual conditions of thought in the learned world than 
the problem of religion in the university. It is a very large subject, and I ques- 
tion whether it can be adequately.dealt with by anyone who is not in actual 
contact with undergraduate life, and who is not aware of the ins and outs of 
thought in it, and who, moreover, is not by reason of professional study brought 
into close zelations with the religious problems of the present day. For myself, 
I believe that in the early years of undergraduate life a course of elementary 
biblical instruction adapted to the needs of young men who are no longer school- 
boys, on the one hand, and are not yet students of philosophy, on the other, is a 
most important part of the curriculum; but I would not carry biblical instruction 
into the upper years of the curriculum, unless in point of scientific thoroughness it 
could compare favorably with the work done in other departments; and then, of 
course, I would not make it compulsory, though I firmly believe that advanced 
students in philosophy and literature should have the opportunity of seeing how the 
problems of literature and philosophy bear upon the Bible and Christianity. For 
if secular themes are to be discussed in a Christian university in a religious spirit 
and under Christian conceptions, it is no less true that religious themes must be 
discussed in a scientific spirit and acccording to scientific principles. It is impos- 
sible for a university to discharge its functions without declaring itself upon the 
great question of religion. The subject no longer lies within the easy possibilities  - 
of definition which existed half a century ago. Then the student of Reid or Dugald 
Stewart debated the question of mediate or immediate perception, or accepted the 
easy account of the mental powers as they were mapped out for him in the psychology 
of introspection, and seldom went any deeper. His religious faith was buttressed by 
a course of lectures on the evidences which treated as postulates what have since 
become some of the most serious problems of our times. There were religious 
difficulties to be dealt with, but they lay for the most part in a remote corner of 
the field of inquiry, and concerned questions like the days of Genesis and the 
extent of the Deluge. It is otherwise now, for the doctrine of evolution has 
made a great change in regard to the place of religion in the studies of the 
universities. Every subject is considered from the historical point of view and 
according to the genetic method. And whether we approve it or not, the relig- 
ious problem is forced into prominence. A man can not study genetic psychology 
and metaphysics and the theory of knowledge at the present day without facing 
the problem of aseparate and enduring selfhood and without asking whether the 
world is to be construed according to a theistic or a pantheistic metaphysic. It is 
idle for the theologians to attempt, as the Ritschlians do, to exclude metaphysics 
from theology; but it is just as idle for the philosopher to talk of excluding theology 
from metaphysics; theology is philosophy and philosophy is theology, so far as the 
question of the relation of God to the world is concerned. AIl problems in philos- 
ophy go back to two questions: whether God exists separate from the world and 
whether we exist separate from God. The fate of religion lies in the answer to these 
questions. When, therefore, the student is wrestling with the problems of meta- 
physics, he is putting his religious faith on trial. It is easy then to see the vital 
relations which the chair of philosophy sustains to practical Christianity, and the 
responsibility that one assumes when he undertakes to be guide, philosopher, and 
friend to the young man who finds himself obliged to seek for himself a fresh orien- 
tation in reference to his religious belief. Now, if one-half of our religion, or what 
is commonly called natural religion, is necessarily involved in the study of philos- 
ophy, the other half, or what is known as revealed religion, is as necessarily involved 
in the study of history. We should hardly think of excluding the history of civil-

ization from the studies of the university, yet it would be difficult, I imagine, to 
treat the history of institutions without reference to Christianity, or trace the his- 
tory of ethical ideas without mentioning the New Testament, or the history of 
opinion in respect to social morality without regard to the Sermon on the Mount ana 
the Pauline literature. These writings may doubtless be referred to without raising 
the question of their authority; but that question must be raised sooner or later, 
because the question respecting authority is involved in that of origin, and the ques- 
tion respecting the origin of the sacred books is involved in the question respecting 
the place of Christianity in the history of the world, and this again is part of the 
broader question respecting the meaning and the history of religion. Any theory 
that undertakes to explain human history must be adequate to give a rational expla- 
nation of religion. It is not merely because of its practical importance, but also 
because of its persistent universality that it has become the object of so much 
interest to the philosopher. Hence it happens that the most earnest students of the 
phenomena of religion are not always religious men, but men often who are anxious 
to show that their theories which destroy the value of religion are abundantly ade- 
quate to expiain it. Now, when one enters upon the study of the history of religion, 
I-do not see how ho can content himself with the simple recognition of Christianity 
as one of the forms in which the religious consciousness has been manifested, or how 
he can avoid assuming some attitude in respect to exceptional claims that Chris- 
tianity makes in its own behalf. He knows what attitude some of the philosophers 
are taking. They are becoming constructive theologians. They are lecturing on 
Jesus and St. Paul, and expounding the ethics and metaphysics of the New Testa- 
ment in the interests of naturalism. What shall we do? Shall the agnostic be free 
to deny the claims of Christianity, and we be hindered from defending it? Now, I 
venture to say that the philosophical construction of the facts of Christianity’ is 
forced upon us by the conditions of thought under which we live and that there is 
no subject wider in its sweep, more imperative in its claim, and more momentous in 
the issues with which it deals, than the philosophy of religion. Into the making of 
it go one’s psychology, one’s ethic, one’s metaphysic, one’s history, one’s literary 
criticism; and on it depends in greater or less degree one’s social science, one’s poli- 
tics, one’s jurisprudence, one’s theology, one’s religion. The day has passed when 
religion was regarded as something very important but not very interesting. There 
are too many, I fear, who do not regard it as important; but among philosophers it 
is generally conceded to be interesting. No well- appointed univ. ersity ean refrain 
from dealing with its problems. For us there can be but one of two positions: We 
must be silent and hand over the discussion to the skeptic, or we must show our- 
selves worthy of the high place we have already won in the department of religious 
philosophy and take a strong position on the side of historic Christianity. There is 
little doubt among us, I think, respecting the attitude that Princeton should ever 
hold. Leaving to the theological schools and to the appropriate ecclesiastical tri- 
bunals the discussion of questions in divinity on which the churches are divided, 
and standing aloof from sectarian controversy, it is our duty to hold ourselves ready 
for the defense of these fundamental truths in philosophy and in religion in the 
maintenance of which Christians of every name have a common interest. I hope 
that Princeton will always stand for belief in the living God, the immortal self, an 
imperative morality, and the Divine Christ. On this broad platform all the true 
friends of Princeton can meet, and here we must stand if we would be true to the 
spirit of our history and continue to deserve the confidence of Christian men. 
  Il. 
I trust that I have made it clear that I fully recognize the fact that however true 
it may be that Christian ideas have been the moving causes in the endowment of 
universities, and particularly of this, and however much it may be proper and even 
inevitable that the great fundamental truths of Christianity should have place in 
university teaching, the particular end for which the university exists is not pri- 
marily the promotion of religion. The university should not be expected to do the 
work of the church. It has ends of its own, and these are not distinctively religious. 
And yet we can not keep religion altogether out of our minds when we consider 
these ends. Religion is indeed, as a little reflection will show, necessary to the full 
and satisfactory realization of the ends for which the university exists, and it is in 
this light that I now wish to regard it. 
It is not necessary to lay stress upon the medieval distinction between the uni- 
versity of masters and the university of scholars for the purpose of settling ques- 
tions of precedence or of determiming the relations they sustain to each other. 
It would hardly be denied on the one hand that the professor’s business is to teach, 
and it would be pretty generally conceded on the other that more is expected of 
him than the discharge of his pedagogic functions. But the distinction 1 have 
referred to will serve a 1 good purpose if it reminds us that the professors of a uni- 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
  NEW JERSEY. 1323 
versity sustain a relation to the gencral public apart from the relation they sustain 
to the students who listen to their instruction. They constitute the priesthood of 
learning and are set apart for the service of Truth. Besides training young men for 
the active duties of life, it may be fairly expected of them that they should enlarge 
the borders of knowledge and contribute substantially to the formation of a sound 
public opinion. These, indeed, I take it, are the three great functions of the uni- 
versity. The institution that is not doing something in each of these directions is 
not accomplishing the work it was intended to do; and for the successful accom- 
plishment of this work a reverent attitude toward religion and a certain amount of 
religious faith would seem to be a logical necessity. 
I lay stress upon that side of the professor’s life which relates him to the general 
public, for the nonacademie consciousness does not always properly apprehend it. 
The professor would not think that his calling were possessed of so much inherent 
dignity if he regarded himself simply as the means of imparting to a body of 
mediocre and often very idle young men the modest amount of knowledge that they 
acquire during @ college course, and he would particularly resent the crude Philis- 
tinism that regards him simply in the light of an employee. The dignity of the 
professor's calling can be maintained only by regarding the incumbent of this office 
as holding a commission as an independent seeker after truth. There is something 
fascinating in such a life. In its fine scope of material things, in its dignified and 
independent simplicity, there is surely something to admire. We can not help feeling, 
it is true, that intellectual labor is sometimes wasted on very unimportant matters 
and that much of what was never known before is not worth knowing, and that 
original research so often means only infinite pains for the gathering of facts that 
involve no theory and help no generalization and apparently serve no other purpose 
than to verify the statement that of making many books there is no end and that 
much study is a weariness of the flesh. ‘Then, too, we find it hard sometimes to hear 
the great man’s arrogance and conceit, and it disappoints us to see him enter the 
world’s market and sell his rash judgments and crude novelties for such poor price 
of place or fame as the world will give. But, after all, the marvel is that the appetite 
for learning and the zest with which men engage in intellectual toil should be so 
enduring. I particularly wonder at the intellectual earnestness of men who have 
discarded all religious belief. They seem to be so inconsisteut and illogical; they 
especially impress me so when they employ their energies in seeking to destroy 
the world’s faith in God; for they seem to be undermining their own career and 
leaving it without a reason. For on the supposition that the world is a system of 
thought relations, there is something natural in man’s persistent effort to explain his 
habitat and give an account of himself. For whether God be our unreached goal of 
endeavor, the ideal Good, the infinite Knower in front of us, above, and beyond; or 
whether it be that the inspiration of the Almighty gives man understanding, so that 
he is the lightof all our seeing, in either case there is a religious element in allinquiry ; 
there is something that partakes almost of a religious act in every serious effort to 
understand the world; there is something almost sacramental in the apprehension 
of a great idea which at the same moment interprets the world and brings the mind 
into fellowship with God. I believe that the indwelling spirit of God is the source 
of our curiosity; that our restless seeking after the right understanding of the 
world is one of the ways in which God reveals himself; that the religious nature of 
man is the key to his intellectual activity and the basis of even his irreligious zeal; 
that if there were no God and no fellowship between God and man, if all that is 
were explicable in the terms of matter and motion, there could be no ideals and no 
intellectual ambition; that if man should lose his faith in God he would lose his 
love of truth, and that the death of religion would be the death of intellectual 
endeavor. 
There is another work which the university ought to perform. It should con- 
tribute toward the forming of a sound public opinion. In a broad and far-reaching 
sense, it should teach patriotism. There is, I grant, a great deal to justify the con- 
fidence with which we rest in the sober second thought of the nation, and the opti- 
mism which makes us feel that the common sense of the American people is equal to 
any emergency. The essential morality of the people of our land, as it finds expres- 
sion in the pulpit and the press, is a great source of comfort in a time of national 
peril. And yet when fundamental morality is assailed; when revolutionary views 
of government are publicly expounded; when socialistic theories find plausible 
advocates, it will not do to rely altogether upon popular sentiment or the naive 
common sense of the American people. We must do something to keep this common 
sense from being corrupted, and this must consist of something more than popular 
harangue and the florid iteration of the commonplaces of morality. There must be 
deep plutosophical discussion of great public questions by men of acknowledged 
authority in political, social, and economic science. This work can be done better 
in the universities than anywhere else. This is what I mean when I say that the 
university should be a school of patriotism. Of a certain type of patriotism there

  1324 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
isnolack. We may trust the instincts of our people, without any help from aca- 
demic sources, to resist foreign interference and defend national honor. We under- 
stand, without being reminded of it, that this land is our heritage and this Western 
civilization is our problem. But the day is past when national pride and patriotic 
devotion can show itself only by awakening the memories of international antago- 
nism. We are in no danger of invasion. Our foes are those of our own household. 
Our difficulties are those which we share with other nations. They are evils incident 
to the struggle for the democratization of government, or that are consequent in its 
rapid development; that follow as a consequence of the congested life of great 
cities, or grow out of the complicated machinery of industrialism. We who believe 
in the stability of government as an ordinance of God should stand by each other 
in all civilized lands on account of the dangers common to all. I believe that the 
universities have something to do toward helping on the cause of good feeling 
between the nations, and particularly between those two nations that are so closely 
bound to each other by the ties of blood, the bonds of a common speech, a common 
law, and a.common religion. Part of the history that we commemorate, and of 
which we are proud, is the place that Princeton took in the struggle for independ- 
ence against the motherland. And now I trust that Princeton, as she enters upon 
a new era in her history, will do her part toward the formation of a public sentiment 
that shail make it impossible for the clash of arms ever to be heard again between 
the great nations of the English-speaking world. I hope that she will do something 
to stimulate the development of the international conscience, to widen the range of 
international law, and to hasten the day when international disputes shall be settled 
by arbitration. International law rests on a basis of morality. It is essentially a 
university study, and I should like to see Princeton take a high place in connection 
with its development. 
But, as I have already implied, the questions which give us most cause for anxiety 
are national and not international. The question with us is whether the popular 
will is still on the side of constitutional government; whether the public conscience 
will stand by the financial integrity of the nation; whether great cities can have 
good government; and whether the ten commandments shall continue to regulate 
social behavior. It is true that a campaign of education is needed. But it is an 
education beyond that which the statistician and the collector of facts can give us. 
It is an education beyond that which appeals to our selfish greed. It must be an 
education which goes to the roots of our moral life. For purposes of convenience 
you may intrust the science of ethics to one man, and of politics to another, and of 
jurisprudence to a third. The economist may study the laws of industrial activity, 
and the student of social science deal with the pathological conditions of society— 
the poverty, the moral pollution, the crime; but when we come to ask whether the 
remedy is to be found in laissez faire, or the interference of the State, or in moral 
measures, we shall find that no department is isolated and distinct; that our meta- 
physics, our ethics, our jurisprudence, our economics, our politics, our social science 
all overlap each other; that all are comprehended in the one idea that all end in a 
moral universe. I do not like the phrase Christian socialism, and I certainly do not 
agree with the opinion entertained by those who use it most. But if Christianity 
is true we can not afford to ignore what it has to say, and there can be no sound 
public opinion upon these great ethical problems which does not make acknowledg- 
ment of the binding obligations of the laws of the Kingdom of God. 
But there is another work which the university is expected to do, and this, though 
it does not so completely fit the imagination of the ambitious professor who dreams 
of fame, is nevertheless the greatest work which it can do. It is the province of the 
university to train men, by means of a liberal education, for the active duties of life. 
It is given only to a few toadd to the world’s stock of knowledge. It isonly at rare 
intervals that we shall succeed in turning out a great thinker who will make his 
mark upon his age. But our colleges and universities are contributing every year 
to the moral and intellectual forces of the world a body of young men whose aggre- 
gate influence is enormous. It would be a mistake if we should ever come to under- 
value this work in Princeton, or assign it a second place. There may easily be too 
many men engaged in the special work of the scholar; there are only limited oppor- 
tunities for a career in science, but there is an unlimited demand for men who can 
bring to the discharge of the ordinary duties of citizenship the advantages of liberal 
education. The best work of Princeton is represented to-day in her 3,916 living 
graduates. They are our lettersof commendation. It is, of course, not to be expected 
of the average graduate that he should be a technical scholar. But we have done 
something if we have opened the eyes of his understanding that he may know what 
the world of thought and learning means. We have done something if we haye 
helped him so to widen the area of his selfhood and adjust it to the world he lives 
in that he can enter into appreciative relationship with the true, the beautiful, and 
good. We have done something if we have so impressed his moral nature that he is 
able to have worthy ideals in regard to his own life and a comprehensive sense of the   
        
  
   
-P-A-G-E-197
NEW JERSEY. 1325 
duties of citizenship. We have rendered no small service to the world if, as the result 
of our werk, the men who go out from our halls are so appreciative of whatsoever 
things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever 
things are pure, whatsoever things are of good report, that they may think on these 
things. It needs no argument to show that the complete man is he whose culture 
culminates in religion. The utilitarian view of education, which regards it as a 
means to an end, is not to be despised. Ishould not be so unpractical as to overlook 
the fact that education helps a man to make a place in the world; to win fortune, 
fame, and power. But a large place must be given to religion in the profit and loss 
account of life, for what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his 
own soul? University men are in an ever-increasing degree to be the influential 
men in this nation. These are the men to whom we must look to be the standard- 
bearers of a high morality; to set an example of unselfish living for worthy ends; 
and that their influence may be good in the ratio that it is great, it is necessary that 
their moral and religious natures shall be trained as well as their intellectual powers. 
We might well feel discouraged if the educated men of this land should cease to be 
religious. And if the graduates of our universities should turn their backs upon the 
religion of their fathers we might well exclaim, “If the light that is in thee be dark- 
ness, how great is that darkness.” 
Iv. 
This leads me to say, in a closing word, that the religious thought of the univer- 
sity must inevitably affect the popular religion. University men set the intellectual 
ion of the day in religion, as in other things. I do not mean by this, of course, 
that religion will hold its own by the grace of university authorities any more than 
I believe that God depends on the good will of the philo ophers for the popular 
recognition of His authority. Believing as I do in revealed religion, I do not believe 
that it will be destroyed by the labors of a few professors of historical and literary 
criticism. But there may be, as there have been, times of religious declension and 
relative loss of faith. And it is a matter of great moment to religion whether the 
intellectual atmosphere in the universixy is favorable to serious religious thought. 
I should like to see a less absorbing interest in sport and a more serious intellectual 
tone. I would not cut off social pleasure from university life, but I would not have 
a university career degenerate into a period of indolent enjoyment. I would not 
take life too seriously, but I would not make it a jest. ‘There is reason to fear that 
men may become skeptics, but there is more reason to fear that they will lapse into 
indifference. There is a one-sided culture that may prove itself the enemy of all 
that is deepest and best in our nature. There is a type of Hellenism that ends in a 
Pagan rehabilitation of the flesh, where the sensuous love of beauty slides easily 
into sensual disregard of morals. There is a scientific devotion to material facts 
which may end in the atrophy of the finer elements of our spiritual nature, which 
involve our poetry, our sentiment, our hope, our trust in the Father in heaven. 
There ere tendencies in university life that awaken anxiety in thoughtful minds. 
And yet Ido not think that the religious influence of the university is only or 
even chiefly negative. From the time of Wickliffe, in Oxford, and Huss, in Prague, 
until the present day, the universitives have been centers of religious movements. 
We have had Puritanism and Rationalism and Sac: entarianism. Christianity 
has been attacked and it has been defended by university men. There have been 
periods of negative theology and periods of apologetic. And with the thought of 
the day on all questions centering in and involving religious problems, one can not 
help believing that the university will soon be the center of another religious move- 
ment. It will not be patristic, and it will not be Puritan in form, but if must be 
constructive. It will attempt the synthesis of modern thought in history, philoso- 
phy, and criticism in reference to the problem of Christianity. The process may 
not go on as we could wish, and there may not go into it all that we could desire, 
but the work will proceed upon the basis of the written Word and the Word made 
flesh. The Logos will be the key to our metaphysic, our history, our social philoso- 
phy, our theory of life. The men who engage in this work will rebuild the edifice 
of faith upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself 
being the chief corner stone. 
I do not know what part Princeton will have in this religions movement, and 
which—dare I prophesy it—may open the twentieth century. It would be strange 
if she should have none, The fathers of this institution have laid the foundations 
deep and strong. It is ours to build thereon. Let us take heed how we build there- 
upon. Let us especially be careful not to undo the work already done, for other 
foundation can no man lay than that that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. But what- 
ever be our place in the sphere of religious ecclesiasticism, let us hope and pray that 
in the sphere of practical religious life Princeton may keep the place she has always 
held.

No part of our work is more important than that which addresses itself to the 
devotional side of our nature and that centers in our chapel services. 
There have been in past days great seasons of religious awakening in this college. 
I pray -God that times of refreshing may come again. There has always been here a 
body of earnest, spiritually minded men. There were never more than there are 
to-day. Christianity, as we understand it, is more than a series of precepts. It is 
a way of salvation. We preach Christ Jesus and Him crucified. We believe that 
He is the propitiation for our sins and that we have redemption through His blood. 
Through all the hundred and fifty years of the history of the college of New Jer- 
sey this message has been faithfully proclaimed in her pulpit, and it is the earnest 
prayer of all who love her best and have served her most that the day may never 
come when it can be said of those who hold high place in Princeton University that 
; they are ashamed of the gospel of Christ. 
PRINCETON IN THE NATION’S SERVICE. 
Oration by Prof. Wooprow Wizson. 
Princeton was founded upon the very eve of the stirring changes which put the 
Revolutionary drama on the stage—not to breed politicians, but to give young men 
such training as, it might be hoped, would fit them handsomely for the pulpit and 
for the grave duties of citizens and neighbors. A small group of Presbyterian min- 
isters took the initiative inits foundation. They acted without ecclesiastical author- 
ity, as if under obligation to society rather than to the church. They had no more 
vision of what was to come upon the country than their fellow-colonists had; they 
knew only that the pulpits of the middle and southern colonies lacked properly 
equipped men and all the youth in those parts ready means of access to the higher 
sort of schooling. They thought the discipline at Yale a little less than liberal, and 
the training offered as a substitute in some quarters a good deal less than thorough. 
They wanted a ‘‘seminary of true religion and good literature,” which should be 
after their own model and among their own people. z 
It was not a sectarian school they wished. They were acting as citizens, not as 
clergymen, and the charter they obtained said never a word about creed or doctrine; 
but they gave religion the first place in their programme, which belonged to it of 
right, and confided the formation of their college to the Rey. Jonathan Dickinson, 
one of their own number, and a man of such mastery as they could trust. 
It was by that time the year 1768; Mr. Dickinson had drawn that little group of 
students about him under the first charter only twenty-one years ago; the college had 
been firmly seated in Princeton only those twelve years in which it had seen Burr 
and Edwards and Davies and Finley die, and had found it not a little hard to live so 
long in the face of its losses and the uneasy movements of the time. It had been 
brought to Princeton in the very midst of the French and Indian war, when the 
country was in doubt who should possess the continent. The deep excitement of 
the stamp act had come, with allits sinister threats of embroilment and disaffection, 
while yet it was in its infancy and first effort to live. It was impossible it should 
obtain proper endowment or right and equitable development in such a season. It 
ought by every ordinary rule of life to have been quite snuffed out in the thick and 
troubled air of the time. New Jersey did not, like Virginia and Massachusetts, 
easily form her purpose in that day of anxious doubt. She was mixed of many war- 
ring elements, as New York also was, and suffered a turbulence of spirit that did not 
very kindly breed true religion and good literature. 
But your thorough Presbyterian is not subject to the ordinary laws of life, is of 
too stubborn a fiber, too unrelaxing a purpose, to suffer mere inconvenience to bring 
defeat. Difficulty bred effort, rather, and Dr. Witherspoon found an institution 
ready to his hand that had come already in that quickening time to a sort of crude 
maturity. It was no small proof of its self-possession and self-knowledge that those 
who watched over it had chosen that very time of crisis to put a man like John 
Witherspoon at the head of its administration, a man so compounded of statesman 
and scholar, Calvinist Scotsman and orator, that it must ever be a sore puzzle where 
to place or rank him, whether among great divines, great teachers, or great states- 
men. He seems to be all these, and to defy classification, so big is he, so various, so 
prodigal of gifts. His vitality entered like a tonic into the college, kept it alive in 
that time of peril—made it as individual and inextiuguishable a force as he himself 
was, alike in scholarship and in public affairs. 
It has never been natural, it has seldom been possible, in this country for learning 
to seek a place apart and hold aloof from affairs. It is only when society is old, long 
settled to its ways, confident in habit, and without self-questionings upon any vital 
point of conduct, that study can effect seclusion and despise the passing interests of 
the day. America has never yet had a season of leisure quiet in which students 
   
-P-A-G-E-199
  NEW JERSEY. 1327 
could seek a life apart without sharp rigors of conscience, or college instractors 
easily forget that they were training citizens as well as drilling pupils; and Prince- 
ton is not likely to forget that sharp schooling of her youth, when she first learned 
the lesson of public service. She shall not easily get John Witherspoon out of her 
constitution. 
It was apiece of providential good fortune that brought such a man to Princcton 
at such a time. He was a man of the sort other men follow and take counsel of 
gladly, and as if they found in him the full expression of what is best in themselves— 
not because he was always wise, but because he showed always so fine an ardor for 
whatever was worth while and of the better part of man’s spirit; because he uttered 
his thought with an inevitable glow of eloquence; because of his irresistible charm 
and individual power. The lively wit of the man, besides, struck always upon the 
matter of his thought like a ray of light, compelling men te receive what he said or 
else seem themselves opaque and laughable. A certain straightforward vigor in 
his way of saying things gave his style an almost irresistible power of entering into 
men’s conyictions. A hearty honesty showed itself in all that he did and won men’s 
allegiance upon the instant. They loyed him even when they had the hardihood to 
disagree with him. 
He came to the college in 1768, and ruled it till he died, in 1794, In the very mid- 
dle of his term, as head of the college, the Revolution came, to draw men’s minds 
imperatively off from everything but war and politics, and he turned with all the 
force and frankness of his nature to the public tasks of the great struggle, assisted 
in the making of a new constitution for the State, became her spokesman in the Con- 
tinental Congress; would have pressed her on, if he could, to utter a declaration of 
independence of her own before the Congress had acted; voted for and signed the 
great Declaration with hearty good will whenit came; acted forthe country in mat- 
ters alike of war and of finance; stood forth in the sight of all the people a great 
adyocate and orator, deeming himself forward in the service of God when most 
engaged in the service of men and of liberty. There were unbroken sessions of the 
collegemeanwhile. Each army in its turn drove out the little group of students who 
clung to the place. The college building became now a military hospital and again 
a barracks for the troops; for a little while, upon a memorable day in 1777, a sort of 
stronghold. New Jersey’s open counties became for a time the Revolutionary battle- 
ground and field of maneuver. Swept through from end to end by the rush of armies, 
the State seemed the chief seat of the war, and Princeton a central point of strategy. 
The dramatic winter of 1776-77 no Princeton man can ever forget, lived he never so 
long—that winter which saw a year of despair turned suddenly into a year of hope. 
In July there had beer bonfires and boisterous rejoicings in the college yard and the 
village street at the news of the Declaration of Independence—for, though the rest 
of the country might doubt and stand timid for a little while to see the bold thing 
done, Dr. Witherspoon’s pupils were in spirits to know the fight was to be fought to 
a finish. Then suddenly the end had seemed to come, Before the year was out 
Washington was in the place, beaten and in full retreat, only three thousand men at 
his back, abandoned by his generals, deserted by his troops, hardly daring to stop 
till he had put the unbridged Delaware between himself and hisenemy. The British 
came close at his heels, and the town was theirs until Washington came back again, 
the third day of the new year, carly in the morning, and gave his view halloo yonder 
upon the hill, as if he were in the hunting field again. Then there was fighting in 
the very streets, and cannon planted against the walls of Old North herself. ’T'was 
not likely any Princeton man would forget those days, when the whole face of the 
war was changed and New Jersey was shaken of the burden of the fighting. There 
was almost always something doing at the place when the soldiers were out, for the 
strenuous Scotsman who had the college at his heart never left it for long at a time, 
for all he was so intent upon the public business. It was haphazard and piecemeal 
work, no doubt, but there was the spirit and the resolution of the Revolution itself 
in what was done—the spirit of Witherspoon. It was not as if someone else had 
been master. Dr, Witherspoon eould have pupils at will. He was so much else 
besides schoolmaster and preceptor, was so great a figure in the people’s eye, went 
about so like an accepted leader, generously lending a great character to a great 
cause, that he could bid men act and know that they would heed him. 
The time, as well as his own genius, enabled him to put a distinctive stamp upon 
his pupils. There was close contact between master and pupils in that day of begin- 
nings. He lectured upon taste and style, as well as upon abstract questions of phi- 
losophy, and upon politics as a science of government, and of public duty as little 
to be forgotten as religion itself in any well-considered plan of life. He had found 
the college ready to serve such purpose when he came, because of the stamp Burr 
and Davies and Finley had putuponit. They had, one and all, consciously set them- 
selves to make the college a place where young men’s minds should be rendered fit 
for affairs, for the public ministry of the bench and senate, as well as of the pulpit. . 
It was in Finley’s day, but just now gone by, that the college had sent out such men 
     
-P-A-G-E-200

as William Paterson, Luther Martin, and Oliver Ellsworth. Witherspoon but gave 
quickened life to the old spirit and method of the place where there had been drill 
from the first in public speech and public spirit. . 
And the Revolution, when it came, seemed but an object lesson in his scheme of 
life. It was not simply fighting that was done at Princeton. The little town became 
for a season the center of politics, too; once and again the legislature of the State 
sat in the college hall, and its Revolutionary Council of Safety. Soldiers and public 
men whose names the war was making known to every man frequented the quiet 
little place, and racy talk ran high in the jolly little tavern where hung the sign of 
Hudibras. Finally the Federal Congress itself sought the place and filled the college 
hall with a new scene, sitting a whole season there to do its business—its President 
a trustee of the college. A commencement day came which saw both Washington 
and Witherspoon on the platform together—the two men, it was said, who could not 
be matched for striking presence in all the country—and the young salutatorian 
turned to the country’s leader to say what it was in the hearts of all to utter. The 
sum of the town’s excitement was made up when, upon that notable last day of Octo- 
ber in the year 1783, news of peace came to that secluded hall to add a crowning 
touch of gladness to the gay and brilliant company met to receive with formal wel- 
come the minister plenipotentiary but just come from the Netherlands, Washington 
moving among them the hero whom the news enthroned. 
It was no single stamp or character that the college gave its pupils. James 
Madison, Philip Freneau, Aaron Burr, and Harry Lee had come from it almost at a 
single birth, between 1771 and 1773—James Madison, the philosophical statesman, 
subtly compounded of learning and practical sagacity; Philip Freneau, the careless 
poet and reckless pamphleteer of a party; Aaron Burr, with genius enough to have 
made him immortal and unschooled passion enough to have made him infamous; 
“Lighthorse Harry” Lee, a Rupert in battle, a boy in counsel, highstrung, audacious, 
willful, lovable, a figure for romance. These men were types of the spirit of which 
the college was full—the spirit of free individual development which found its perfect 
expression in the President himself. 
Princeton sent upon the public stage an extraordinary number of men of notable 
quality in those days; became herself for a time in some visible sort the academic 
center of the Revolution; fitted, among the rest, the man in whom the country was 
one day to recognize the chief author of the Federal Constitution. Princetonians 
are never tired of telling how many public men graduated from Princeton in With- 
spoon’s time—20 Senators, 23 Representatives, 13 Governors, 3 judges of the Supreme 
Court of theUnion, 1 Vice President, anda President; all within aspaceof twenty years, 
and from a college which seldom had more than 100 students. Nine Princeton men 
sat in the Constitutional Convention of 1787; and, though but 6 of them were With- 
erspoon’s pupils, there was no other college that had there so many as 6, and the 
redoubtable doctor might have claimed all 9 as hisin spirit and capacity. Madison 
guided the convention through the critical stages of its anxious work with a tact, 
a gentle quietness, an art of leading without insisting, ruling without commanding, 
an authority, not of tone or emphasis, but of apt suggestion—suc Dr. Witherspeon 
could never have exercised. Princeton men fathered both the Virginia plan, which 
was adopted, and the New Jersey plan, which was rejected; and Princeton men 
advocated the compromises without which no plan could have won acceptance. The 
strenuous Scotsman’s earnest desire and prayer to God to see a government set over 
the nation that should last was realized as even he might not have been bold enough 
to hope. Noman had ever better right to rejoice in his pupils. 
It would be absurd to pretend that we can distinguish Princeton’s touch and method 
in the Revolution or her distinctive handiwork in the Constitution of the Union. We 
can show nothing more of historical fact than that her own president took a great 
place of leadership in that time of change and became one of the first figures of the 
age; that the college which he led and to which he gave his spirit contributed more 
than her share of public men to the making of the nation, outranked her elder rivals 
in the roll-call of the Constitutional Convention, and seemed for a little a seminary 
of statesmen rather than a quiet seat of academic learning. What takes our admi- 
ration and engages our fancy in looking back to that time is the generous union then 
established in the college between the life of philosophy and the life of the State. 
It moves her sons very deeply to find Princeton to have been from the first what 
they know her to have been in their own day—a school of duty. The Revolutionary 
days are gone, and you shall not find upon her rolls another group of names given 
to public life that can equal her muster in the days of the Revolution and the forma- 
tion of the Government. But her rolls read since the old days, if you know but a 
little of the quiet life of scattered neighborhoods, like a roster of trustees, a list of 
the silent men who carry the honorable burdens of business and of social obligation, 
of such names as keep credit and confidence in heart. They suggest a soil full of 
the old seed, and ready, should the air of the time move shrewdly npon it as in the 
old days, to spring once more into the old harvest. The various, boisterous strength     
   
-P-A-G-E-201
NEW JERSEY. 1329 
of the young men of affairs who went out with Witherspoon’s touch upon them is 
obviously not of the average breed of any place, but the special fruitage of an excep- 
tional time. Later generations inevitably reverted to the elder type of Paterson and 
Ellsworth, the type of sound learning and stout character, without bold impulse 
added or any uneasy hope to change the world. It has been Princeton’s work, in all 
ordinary seasons, not to change but to strengthen society, to give, not yeast, but 
bread for the raising. 
No one who looks into the life of the institution shall find it easy to say what gave 
itits spirit and kept it in its character the generations through, but some things lie 
obvious to the view in Princeton’s case. She had always been a school of religion, 
and no one of her sons, who has really lived her life, has escaped that steadying 
touch which has made her a school of duty. Religion, conceive it but liberally 
enough, is the true salt wherewith to keep both duty and learning sweet against the 
taint of time and change, and it is a noble thing to have conceived it thus liberally, 
as Princeton’s founders did. Duty with them was a practical thing, concerned with 
righteousness in this world, as well as with salvation in the next. , There is nothing 
that gives such pith to public service as religion. A God of truth isno mean prompter 
to the enlightened service of mankind; and character formed, as if in His eye, has 
always a fiber and sanction such as you shall not obtain for the ordinary man from 
the mild promptings of philosophy. 
It is noteworthy how often God-fearing men have been forward in those revolutions 
which have vindicated rights, and how seldom in those which have wrought a work 
of destruction. There was a spirit of practical piety in the revolutionary doctrines 
which Dr. Witherspoon taught. No man, particularly a young man, who heard him 
could doubt a cause, a righteous cause, or deem religion aught but a prompter in it. 
Revolution was not to be distinguished from duty in Princeton. Duty becomes the 
more noble when thus conceived the “stern daughter of the voice of God,” and that 
voice must ever seem near and in the midst of life if it be made to sound dominant 
from the first in all thought of men in the world. It has not been by accident, there- 
tore, that Princeton men have been inclined to public life. A strong sense of duty 
is a fretful thing in confinement, and will not easily consent to be kept at home 
clapped up within a narrow round. The university in our day is no longer inclined 
to stand aloof from the practical world, and, surely, it ought never to have had the 
disposition to do so. It is the business of a university to impart to the rank and file 
of the men whom it trains the right thought of the world, the thought which it has 
tested and established, the principles which have stood through the seasons and 
become at length a part of the immemorial wisdom of the race. The object of educa- 
tion is not merely to draw out the powers of the individual minds; it is rather its 
object to draw all minds to a proper adjustment to the physical and social world in 
which they are to have their life and their development; to enlighten, strengthen, 
and make fit. The business of the world is not individual success, but its own bet- 
terment, strengthening, and growth in spiritual insight. ‘So teach us to number 
our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom” is the right prayer and 
aspiration, 
it was not a work of destruction which Princeton helped forward even in that day 
of storm which came at the Revolution, but work of preservation. The American 
Revolution wrought a radical change in the world; it created a new nation and a 
new polity; but it was a work of conservation after all, as fundamentally conserva- 
tive as the revolution of 1688 or the extortion of Magna Charta. A change of alle- 
giance and the erection of a new nation in the West were its inevitable results but 
not its objects. Its object was the preservation of the body of liberties, to keep the 
natural course of English development in America clear of impediment. It was 
meant, not in rebellion, but in self-defense. If it brought change, it was the change 
of maturity, the fulfillment of destiny, the appropriate fruitage of wholesale and 
steady growth. It was part of English liberty that America should be free. The 
thought of our Revolution was as quick and vital in the minds of Chatham and of — 
Burke as in the minds of Otis and Henry and Washington. ‘There is nothing so con- 
servative of life as growth; when that stops, decay sets in and the end comes on 
apace. Progress is life, for the body politic as for the body natural. To stand still 
is to court death. 
Here, then, if you will but look, you have the law of conservatism disclosed; it is 
alaw of progress. But not all change is progress, not all growth is the manifesta- 
tion of life. Let one part of the body be in haste to outgrow the rest and you have 
malignant disease, the threat of death. The growth that is a manifestation of life 
is equitable, draws its springs gently out of the old fountains of strength, builds 
upon old tissue, covets the old airs that have blown upon it time out of mind in the 
past. Colleges ought surely to be the best nurseries of such life, the best schools of 
the progress which conserves, Unschooled men have only their habits to remind 
them of the past, only their desires and their instinctive judgments of what is right 
to guide them into the future; the college should serve the State as its organ of 
ED 97. 84.   
 
-P-A-G-E-202

recollection, its seat of vital memory. It should give the country men who know 
the probabilities of failure and success, who can separate the tendencies which are 
permanent from the tendencies which are of the moment merely, who can distin- 
guish promises from threats, knowing the life men have lived, the hopes they have 
tested, and the principles they have proved. 
This college gave the country at least a handful of such men in its infancy, and-its 
president for leader. The blood of John Knox ran in Witherspoon’s veins. The 
great drift and movement of English liberty, from Magna Charta down, was in all 
his teachings; his pupils knew as well as Burke did that to argue the Americans out 
of their liberties would be to falsify their pedigree. ‘In order to prove that the 
Americans have no right to their liberties,” Burke eried, ‘‘we are every day endeay- 
oring to subvert the maxims which preserve the whole spirit of our own;” the very 
antiquarians of the law stood ready with their proof that the colonies could not be 
taxed by Parliament. This Revolution, at any rate, was a keeping of faith with the 
past. To stand for it was to be like Hampden, a champion of law though he with- 
stood the king. It was to emulate the example of the very men who had founded 
the Government, then for a little while grown so tyrannous and forgetful of its great 
traditions. This was the compulsion of life, not of passion, and college halls were a 
better school of revolution than colonial assemblies. 
Provided, of course, they were guided by such a spirit as Witherspoon’s, nothing 
is easier than to falsify the past; lifeless instruction will do it. If you rob it of 
vitality, stiffen it with pedantry, sophisticate it with argument, chill it with unsym- 
pathetic comment, you render it as dead as any academic exercise. The safest way 
in all ordinary seasons is to let it speak for itself; resort to its records, listen to its 
poets and to its masters in the humbler art of prose. Your real and proper object, 
after all, is not to expound, but to realize it, consort with it, and make your spirit 
kin with it, so that you may never shake the sense of obligation off. In short, I 
believe that the catholic study of the world’s literature as arecord spirit is the right 
preparation for leadership in the world’s affairs, if you undertake it like a man and 
not like a pedant. 
Age is marked in the case of every people, just as it is marked in the case of every 
work of art, into which enters the example of the masters, the taste of long genera- 
tions of men, the thought that has matured, the achievement that has come with 
assurance. The child’s crude drawing shares the primitive youth of the first hiero- 
glyphics; but a little reading, a few lessons from some modern master, 2 little time 
in the old world’s galleries set the lad forward a thousand years and more, make his 
drawing as old as artitself. The art of thinking is as old, and it is the wniversity’s 
functions to impartit in allits length; the stiff and diffieult stuffs of fact and expe- 
rience of prejudice and affection, in which the hard art is to work its will, and the 
long and tedious combinations of cause and effect out of which it is to build up its 
results, How else will you avoid a ceaseless round of error? The world’s memory 
must be kept alive, or we shall never see an end of its old mistakes. We are in dan- 
ger to lose our identity and become infantile in every generation. That is the real 
menace under which we cower everywhere in this age of change. The old world 
trembles to see its proletariat in the saddle; we stand dismayed to find ourselves 
growing no older, always as young as the information of our most numerous voters. 
‘The danger docs not lie in the fact that the masses whom we have enfranchised seek 
to work any iniquity upon us, for their aim, take it in the large, is to make a right- 
eous polity. The peril lies in this, that the past is discredited among them, because 
they played no choosing part init. It was their enemy, they say, and they will not 
learn of it. They wish to break with itforever; its lessons are tainted to their taste. 
In America, especially, we run perpetually this risk of newness. Righteously 
enough, it isin part a consequence of boasting. To enhance our credit for origi- 
nality we boasted for long that our institutions were one and all our own inventions, 
and the pleasing error was so got into the air by persistent discharges of oratory 
that every man’s atmosphere became surcharged with it, and it seems now quite too 
late to dislodge it. Three thousand miles of sea, moreover, roll between us and the 
elder past of the world. Weare isolated here. We can not see other nations in 
detail, and looked at in the large they do not seem like ourselves. Our problems, 
wesay, are our own, and we will take our own way of solving them. Nothing seems 
audacious among us, for our case seems to us to stand singular and without parallel. 
We run in a free field, without recollection of failure, without heed of example. 
It is plain that it is the duty of an institution of learning set in the midst of a 
free population and amidst signs of social change, not merely to implant a sense of 
duty, but to illuminate duty by every lesson that can be drawn out of the past. Itis 
not a dogmatic process. I know of no book in which the lessons of the past are set 
down. I donot know of any man whom the world could trust to write such a book. 
But it somebow comes about that the man who has traveled in the realms of thought 
brings lessons home with him which make him grave and wise beyond his fellows, 
and thoughtful with the thoughtfulness of a true man of the world.

This, it seems to me, is the real, the prevalent argument for holding every man we 
can to the intimate study of the ancient classics, All literature that has lasted has 
this claim upon us; that it is not dead; but we can not be quite so sure of any as we 
are of the ancient literature that still lives, because none has lived so long. It holds 
a sort of leadership in the aristocracy of natural selection. 
Read it, moreover, and you will find another proof of vitality in it, more signifi- 
cant still. You shall recognize its thoughts, and even its fancies, as your long-time 
familiars—shall recognize them as the thoughts that have begotten a vast deal of 
your own literature. It is the general air of the world a man gets when he reads 
the classics, the thinking which depends upon no time, but only upon human nature, 
which seoms full of the voices of the human spirit, quick with the power which 
moves ever upon the face of affairs. ‘What Plato has thought he may think; what 
a saint has felt he may feel; what at any time has befallen any man he can under- 
stand.” 
I believe, of course, that there is another way of preparing young men to be wise. 
I need not tell you that I believe in the full, explicit instruction in history and in 
politics, in the experiences of peoples and the fortunes of governments, in the whole 
story of what men have attempted and what they have accomplished through all 
the changes, both of form and purpose, in their organization of their common life. 
Many minds will receive and heed this systematic instruction which have no ears 
for the voice that is the printed page of literature. 
It used to be taken for granted—did it not?’—that colleges would be found always 
on the conservative side of politics (except on the question of free trade), but in 
this latter day a great deal has taken place which goes far toward discrediting 
the presumption. The college in our day lives very near indeed to the affairs of the 
world. It isa place of the latest experiments; its laboratories are brisk with the 
spirit of discovery; its lecture rooms resound with the discussion of new theories of 
life and novel programmes of reform. There is no radical like the learned radical, 
bred in the schools, and thoughts of revolution have in our time been harbored in 
universities as naturally as they were once nourished among the encyclopedists. It 
is tho scientific spirit of the age that has wrought the change. I stand with my hat 
off at every mention of the great men who haye made our age an age of knowledge. 
No man more heartily admires, more gladly welcomes, more approvingly reckons the 
gain and the enlightenment that have come to the world through the extraordinary 
advances in physical science which this age has witnessed. He would be a bar- 
barian and a lover of darkness who should grudge that great study any part of its 
triumph. But Lama student of society and should deem myself unworthy of the 
comradeship of great men of science should I not speak the plain truth with regard 
to what I see happening under my own eyes. I have no laboratory but the world of 
books and men in which I live; but [am much mistaken if the scientific spirit of 
the age is not doing us a certain great disservice, working in us a certain great 
degeneracy. Science has bred in us a Spirit of experiment and a contempt for the 
past. It has made us credulous of quick improvement, hopeful of discovering pan- 
aceas, confident of success in every new thing. 
Let me say this is not the fault of the scientist. He has done his work with an 
intelligence and success which can not be too much admired. It is the work ef the 
noxious, intoxicating gas which has somehow got into the lungs of the rest of us 
from out the crevices of his workshop—a gas, it would seem, which forms only in 
the outer air, ard where men do not know the right use of their lungs. I should 
tremble to sce social reform led by men who had breathed it; I should fear nothing 
better than utter destruction from a revolution conceived and led in a scientific 
spirit. 
Do you wonder, then, that I ask for the old drill, the old memory of times gone 
by, the old schooling in precedent and tradition, the old keeping of faith with the 
past, as a preparation for leadership in the days of social change? We have not 
given science too big a place in our education; but we have made a perilous mistake 
in giving it too great a preponderance in method and in every other branch of study. 
We must make the humanities human again; must recall what manner of men we 
are, must turn back once more to the region of practical ideals, 
Of course, when allis said, it is not learning but the spirit of service that will give 
a college place in the public annals of the nation. It is indispensable, it seems to me, 
if it is to do its right service, that the air of affairs should be admitted to all its class 
rooms. I do not mean the air of party politics, but the aiz of the world’s transaction, 
the consciousness of solidarity of the race, the sense of the duty of man toward man, 
of the presence of men in every problem, of the significance of truth, for guidance 
as well as for knowledge, of the potency of ideas, of the promise and the hope that 
shine in the face of all knowledge. There is laid upon us the compulsion of the 
national life. We dare not keep aloof and closet ourselves while a naticn comes to 
its maturity. The days of wide expansion are gone, our life grows tense and diffi- 
cult; our resources for the future lie in careful thought, providence, and a wise

economy; and the school must be of the nation. I haye had sight of the perfect 
place of learning in my thought; a free place, and a various, where no man could be 
and not know with how great a destiny knowledge had come into the world—itself 
a little world; but not perplexed, living with a singleness of aim not known without; 
the home of sagacious men, hardheaded and with a will to know, debaters of the 
world’s questions every day and used to the rough ways of democracy; and yet a 
place removed—calm, silence seated there, recluse, ascetic, like a nun, not knowing 
that the world passes, not caring if the truth but come in answer to her prayer; and 
literature, walking within her open doors in quiet chambers with men of olden time, 
storied walls about her, and calm voices infinitely sweet; here ‘magic casements, 
opening on the foam of perilous seas, in fairy lands forlorn,” to which you may 
withdraw and use your youth for pleasure; there windows open straight upon the 
street, where many stand and talk, intent upon the world of men and business. A 
place where ideals are kept in heart in an atmosphere that they can breathe; but no 
fool’s paradise. <A place to hear the truth about the past and hold debate about the 
affairs of the present, with knowledge and without passion; like the world in hay- 
ing all men’s life at heart; a place for men and all that concerns them; but unlike 
the world in its self-possession, its thorough way of talk, its care to know more than 
the moment it brings to light; slow to take excitement, its air pure and wholesome 
with a breath of faith; every eye within it bright in the clear day and quick to look 
toward heaven for the confirmation of its hope, Who shall show us the way to this 
lace?   
PRESIDENT CLEVELAND’S SPEECH ON THE SESQUICENTENNIAL DAY. 
Mr. PRESIDENT AND LADIES AND G 'LEMEN: As those in different occupations 
and with different training each see most plainly in the same landscape view those 
features which are the most nearly related to their several habitual environments, 
so, in our contemplation of an event or an occasion, each individual especially 
observes and appreciates, in the light his mode of thought supplies, such of its 
features and incidents as are mostin harmony with his mental situation. 
‘To-day, while all of us warmly share the general enthusiasm and felicitation 
which pervade this assemblage, I am sure its various suggestions and meanings 
assume a prominence in our respective fields of mental vision, dependent upon their 
relation to our experience and condition. Those charged with the management and 
direction of the educational advantages of this noble institution most plainly see, 
with well-earned satisfaction, proofs of its growth and usefulness and its enhanced 
opportunities for doing good. The graduate of Princeton sees first the evidence of a 
greater glory and prestige than have come to his alma mater, and the added honor 
thence reflected upon himself, while those still within her student halls see most 
prominently the promise of an increased dignity which awaits their graduation from 
Princeton University. 
But there are others here, not of the family of Princeton, who see, with an inter- 
est not to be outdone, the signs of her triumph on the fields of higher education, and 
the part she has taken during her long and glorious career in the elevation and bet- 
terment of a great people. 
Among these I take an humble place, and as I yield to the influences of this occa- 
sion, I can not resist the train of thought which especially reminds me of the promise 
of national safety and the guaranty of the permanence of our free institutions, which 
may and ought to radiate from the universities and colleges scattered throughout 
our land. 
Obviously a government resting upon the will and universal suffrage of the people 
has no anchorage except in the people’s intelligence. While the advantages of a 
collegiate education are by no means necessary to good citizenship, yet the college 
graduate, found everywhere, can not smother his opportunities to teach his fellow- 
countrymen, and influence them for good, nor hide his talents in a napkin, without 
recreancy to a trust. 
In a nation like ours, charged with the care of numerous and widely varied inter- 
ests, a spirit of conservatism and toleration is absolutely essenti A collegiate 
training, the study of principles unvexed by distracting and misleading influences, 
and a correct apprehension of the theories upon which our Republic is established, 
ought to constitute the college graduate a constant monitor, warning against popu- 
Jar rashness and excess. 
The character of our institutions and our national self-interest require that a feel- 
ing of sincere brotherhood and a disposition to unite in mutual endeavor should per- 
vade our people. Our scheme of government in its beginning was based upon this 
sentiment, and its interruption has never failed and can never fail to grievously 
menace our national health. Who can better caution against passion and bitterness 
than those who know by thought and study their baneful consequences, and who 
are themselves within the noble brotherhood of higher education?     
 
-P-A-G-E-205
NEW JERSEY. 1333 
There are natural laws and economic truths which command implicit obedience, 
and which should unalterably fix the bounds of wholesome popular discussion, and 
the limits of political strife. The,knowledge gained in our universities and colleges 
would be sadly deficient if its beneficiaries wore unable to recognize and point out 
to their fellow-citizens these truths and natural laws, and to teach the mischievous 
futility of their nonobservance or attempted violation. 
The activity of our people and their restless desire to gather to themselves especial 
benefits and advantages lead to the growth of an unconfessed tendency to regard 
their Government as the giver of private gifts, and to look upon the agencies for its 
administration as the distributors of official places and preferment. ‘Those who in 
university or college have had an opportunity to study the mission of our institu- 
tions, and who, in the light of history, have learned the danger to a people of their 
neglect of the patriotic care they owe the national life intrusted to their keeping, 
should be well fitted to constantly admonish their fellow citizens that the usefulness 
and beneficence of their plan of government can only be preserved through their 
unselfish and loving support, and their contented willingness to accept in full return 
the peace, protection, and opportunity which it impartially bestows 
Not more surely do the rules of honesty and good faith fix the standard of indi- 
vidual character in a community than do these same rules determine the character 
and standing of a nation in the world of civilization. Neither the glitter of its 
power, nor the tinsel of its commercial prosperity, nor the gaudy show of its people’s 
wealth, can conceal the cankering rust of national dishonesty, and cover the mean- 
ness of national bad faith. A constant stream of thoughtful, educated men shouid 
come from our universities and colleges preaching national honor and integrity, and 
teaching that a belief in the necessity of national obedience to the laws of God is 
not born of superstition. 
I do not forget the practical necessity of political parties, nor do I deny their 
desirability. I recognize wholesome differences of opinion touching legitimate 
governmental policies, and would by no means control or limit the utmost freedom 
in their discussion. I have only attempted to suggest the important patriotic serv- 
ice which our institutions of higher education and their graduates are fitted to 
render to our people, in the enforcement of those immutable truths and fundamental 
principles which are related to our national condition, but should never be dragged 
nto the field of political strife nor impressed into the service of partisan contention, 
When the excitement of party warfare presses dangerously near our national safe- 
guards, I would have the intelligent conservatism of our universities and colleges 
warn the contestants in impressive tones against the perils of a breach impossible to 
repair. 
When popular discontent and passion are stimulated by the arts of designing par- 
tisans to a pitch perilously near to class hatred or sectional anger, I would have our 
universities and colleges sound the alarm in the name of American brotherhood and 
fraternal dependence. 
When the attempt is made to delude the people into the belief that their suffrages 
can change the operation of natural laws, I would have our universities and colleges 
proclaim that those laws are inexorable and far removed from political control. 
When selfish interest seeks undue private benefit through governmental aid and 
public places are claimed as rewards of party service, I wonld have our universities 
and colleges persuade the people to a relinquishment of the demand for party spoils 
and exhort them to a disinterested and patriotic love of their Government for its 
own sake, and because in its true adjustment and unperverted operation it secures 
to every citizen his just share of the safety and prosperity it holds in store for all. 
When a design is apparent to lure the people from their honest thoughts and to 
blind their eyes to the sad plight of national dishonor and bad faith, I would have 
Princeton University, panoplied in her patriotic traditions and glorious memories, 
and, joined by all the other universities and colleges of our land, cry out against the 
infliction of this treacherous and fatal wound. 
I would have the influence of these institutions on the side of religion and moral- 
ity. I would have those they send out among the people not ashamed to acknowledge 
God and to proclaim His interposition in the affairs of men, enjoining such cbe- 
dience to His laws as makes manifest the path of national perpetuity and prosperity. 
I hasten to concede the good already accomplished by our educated men in puri- 
fying and steadying political sentiment; but I hope I may be allowed to intimate 
my belief that their work in these directions would be easier and more useful if it 
were less spasmodic and occasional. The disposition of our people is such that while 
they may be inclined to distrust those who only on rare occasions come among them 
from an exclusiveness savoring of assumed superiority, they readily listen to those 
who exhibit a real fellowship and a friendly and habitual interest in all that con- 
cerns the common welfare. Such a condition of intimacy would, I believe, not only 
improve the general political atmosphere, but would vastly increase the influence of 
our universities and colleges in their efforts to prevent popular delusions, or correct 
them before they reach an acute and dangerous stage.   
   
-P-A-G-E-206
  1384 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
I am certain, therefore, that a more constant and active participation in political 
affairs on the part of our men of education would be of the greatest possible value 
to our country. . ; 
It is exceedingly unfortunate that politics should be regarded in any quarter as an 
unclean thing, to be avoided by those claiming to be educated or respectable. It 
would be strange indeed if anything related to the administration of our Goyern- 
ment or the welfare of our nation should be essentially degrading. I believe itis 
not a superstitious sentiment that leads.to the conviction that God has watched over 
our national life from its beginning. Who will say that the things worthy of God’s 
regard and fostering care are unworthy of the touch of the wisest and best of men? 
I would have those sent out by our universities and colleges not only the counsel- 
lors of their fellow-countrymen, but the tribunes of the people—fully appreciating 
every condition that presses upon their daily life, sympathetic in every untoward 
situation, quick and earnest in every effort to advance their happiness and welfare, 
and prompt and sturdy in the defense of all their rights. 
Lhave but imperfectly expressed the thoughts to which I have not been able to 
deny utterance on any occasion so full of glad significance and so pervaded by the 
atmosphere of patriotic aspiration. Born of these surroundings, the hope can not 
be vain that the time is at hand when all our cointrymen will more deeply appreciate 
the blessings of American citizenship, when their disinterested love of their Govern- 
ment will be quickened, when fanaticism and passion shall be banished from the 
field of polities, and when all our people, discarding every difference of condition or 
opportunity, will be seen under the banner of American brotherhood, marching 
steadily and unfalteringly on toward the bright heights of our national destiny,     
NEW JERSEY SCHOOL REPORT. 
Report for 1895, Hon. A. B. Poland, State superintendent. 
Tho adoption of the township system reduced the number of school districts from 
1,403 in 1894 to 374 in 1895. ‘The weaker districts have in many instances been joined 
to stronger, by which the greater part of the inequality of taxation and population 
has disappeared. 
The report is outspoken upon the beneficial results of the laws adopted by the 
legislature in 1894 and 1895. Among proofs of great progress are mentioned the fol- 
lowing: Larger expenditures than ever before for new buildings; larger expenditures 
for repairs and permanent improvements of all kinds; free supply of text-books; 
increased salaries of teachers; greater demand for trained and successful teachers; 
unusual progress in grading schools; appointment of supervising principals in town- 
ships; better attended and more enthusiastic school meetings in nearly every district 
in the State. 
Some fears had been indulged that the strong districts would be crippled by con- 
solidation with the weak, but experience has proved that these fears were without 
good foundation. The whole have been strengthened by being placed under the 
same supervision and management. So also were the apprehensions that the village 
schools might be to a degree handicapped by the rural. 
Improvement in school buildings has been more notable than in any previous year, 
as many as 95 new ones having been erected and nearly as many more enlarged, refur- 
nished, and remodeled, the amount of money in that behalf expended being near by 
three-quarters of a million. 
The legislature of 1894, unwisely, it is thought, allowed small boroughs of only a 
few hundred of population to constitute separate school districts. The legislature 
limited tho privilege to those containing 400 andover. Even as it is, however, some 
of the evils of the old district system must remain, the calculation being that a 
school district, to be capable of being properly graded and taught, must contain a 
number of 500 to 1,000 school children. : 
Noteworthy, says the report, is the constant decrease of men teachers. These are 
paid as well as ever; but other avocations have become more attractive to men of 
requisite competency, and those without this can no longer give employment under 
late advanced methods. To some degree this falling off is to be regretted, as tending 
to disturb what is believed to be desired and even needed—a just equilibrium between 
the sexes. The report, among other things on this head, says: 
“Women, as a rule, possess more sympathy, delicacy, and tact, hence for small 
children are better adapted than men; but the sterner, the more vigorous, and force- 
ful qualities of a man are needed to develop fully the character of pupils and engage 
successfully in the struggle of life.” 
The report argues the necessity of employing (as in cities) superintendents to 
townships comprising several schools, though widely scattered, the additional cost 
being made up by appointing a leading teacher to the office. Then cooperative 
supervision, as in the State of Massachusetts, might be agreed upon by two or more   
-P-A-G-E-207

districts. Regret is expressed that the State is so notably far behind many others 
in the matter of high schools, and earnest appeal is made for their increase, as well 
as for the establishment of other normal schools: The counties of Essex, Passaic, 
and Hudson are centers of population even greater than Mercer, where is situate the 
one overcrowded institution of the kind. It seems a hardship that in several popu- 
lous centers, resort for want of normal has to be had to special training schools. 
In view of the fact that the public schools are required to be open during at least 
nine months in the year (a longer term than in any other State), every facility pos- 
sible should be afforded toward compliance, practical and efficient. 
1896. 
Improvements, according to the State report of 1896, have been made all along the 
line of education. The new rule requiring a uniform course of study for the 
respective counties is cordially indorsed. Among other things said in its favor are 
the following: 
“Under its provisions the old go-as-you-please methods of the rural schools will 
become a thing of the past. The teacher will feel the stimulus of specific require- 
ments within definite periods of time, and systematic and substantial progress will 
result. Another certain effect of this measure will be to place the rural schools in 
the same line of progress as the well-graded schools of our larger towns and cities 
and contribute to the advantage of both.” 
Another rule is much approved, which provides for county pedagogical libraries. 
This has been met with much favor everywhere, and it is predicted that it will be 
one of the most benign provisions ever made in behalf of free education. The 
report also praises the rule authorizing the issuance of county diplomas to pupils 
who shall successfully complete the prescribed course of study, and to those teachers 
who shall intelligently complete the course of professional reading adapted to their 
respective grades and further the granting of special certificates. The conditions 
on which these may be obtained must be getting not less than 80 on any one branch 
and a general average not less than 90 proofs of exceptional skill in organization 
and management of a school. 
The tables show large increase in amounts expended in teachers’ salaries, in build- 
ings, in text-books, and apparatus, improvement in the grading of schools, steadily 
increasing demand for trained teachers, more intelligent interest on the part of local 
school boards, increase in number of teachers with high-grade certificates, and 
revival of interest in teachers’ institutes. In the new buildings attention is shown, 
not only to general comfort and fitness, but to tasteful ornamentation. 
Manual training, comparatively new in the State, is receiving enhanced attention, 
and recommendation is offered that the annual appropriation, thus far limited to 
$25,000, may be increased. 
The report earnestly urges increase in kindergarten instruction. Some of its lan- 
guage we quote: 
“This not only prepares the way for manual training, but also lays the best foun- 
dation for all subsequent school work. It has met the supreme test of experience, 
and proved itself worthy of introduction in some modified form into every public 
school. : +: Inthe majority of our large towns and cities the crying need of our 
schools is more seating capacity, more room. This should be speedily remedied, the 
legal school age reduced'to 4 years, and all of this age included in the apportionment 
of school moneys. The practical value of the kindergarten as an educational value 
force having become established, it should receive from the State such recognition 
and encouragement as is due. The State department is improving every opportunity 
to emphasize the value and importance of this form of instruction and to give ita 
larger place in public interest.” 
The report makes an equally urgent appeal for increase of seeondary (high) schools. 
“Anyone,” itsays, ‘‘interested in educational affairs can not have failed to observe 
that in every town or village where a high school has been established it has resulted 
in the betterment of its entire school system. In employing a competent teacher for 
such a school they also secured supervision that systemized and improved all the 
lower grades. ++: The tendency of the college is toward the rounding out and 
elevation of the high school, and that of the high school toward the betterment of 
all the grades below it; thus, in the educational as in the material world, light 
comes from above.” 
Again an urgent appeal is made for additional normal schools, the need of which 
is so great that the superintendent confidently predicts their inevitable speedy estab- 
lishment. Notwithstanding this pressing want, the number of inexperienced teachers 
is ounally, decreasing, that for the last year being only 20 in an accession of 236 to 
the list.

EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
NEWARK SCHOOL REPORT. 
Report for 1895, William N, Barringer, city superintendent. 
The report makes extended observations of the pressing needs of greater school 
accommodations, needs which naturally increase from year to year because of the 
constant growth of population. 
The three kindergarten schools already established have been doing satisfactory 
work, and there are numbers of first-year classes doing the work introductory to the 
primary. 
The high school gains continually in favor, and urgent appeal is made for erecting 
a building suited to all its important ends, about the location of which care in selec- _ 
tion is recommended. 
Complaint is made of insufficiency in the number of normal schools in the State. 
In this behalf the report says: 
“We can not, in any satisfactory degree, supply the schools of the State with pro- 
fessionally trained teachers with our present normal resources. We should have at 
least three of those institutions in the State—one in the southern part of the State, 
another in the northern—to cooperate with our excellent central normal school at 
Trenton.” 
It is claimed that Newark yet stands practically alone in the creation of summer 
schools. During the ten years of their existence the benefits resulting have been 
eminently satisfactory. 
Work in the evening schools has been far from satisfactory. They seem to be not 
well understood by the public, many of whom severely criticise it. Then the session 
(one hour and forty-five minutes), the report argues, is too short. Another difficulty 
is the employment of inexperienced teachers. This last is, perhaps, the most seri- 
ous among the hindrances that obstruct their success. This year their management 
was placed in control of the evening school committee, whose first action was decid- 
ing to employ none as teachers who have not had some experience. The result is 
that conditions have become.much more satisfactory. The evening high school 
does good work, but this is embarrassed by slight attendance from the same causes 
as in the district schools. ‘ 
The truant department is claimed to be doing better than ever before, because of 
increased cooperation of parents and others. There was decrease in number of cases 
reported. Greater vigilance is claimed also on the part of looking after the health 
of children in all the schools, the number of deaths being 62 in an enrollment of 
30,000. 
Manual training has not yet been introduced, but the report recommends its intro- 
duction, placing it under control of the committee on text-books, course of study, 
and examination. ; 
The report makes several considerate observations on class-room work. 
It concludes with a review of the work done by the board of education within the 
last nineteen years, from 1877 to 1896. Among the improvements made were devising 
of means for obtaining more and more competent teachers through professional train- 
ing, as by the daily normal school; another, reduction of classes, which used to range 
from 60 to 120; in providing better methods for ventilation; sanitation is another; 
diminishing the number of formal examinations; another, establishment of summer 
schools; and others, as methods of honorary promotion and graduation, establishment 
of evening schools, kindergartens, etc. 
Total enrollment of pupils was 33,505; average enrollment, 23,363; average attend- 
auce, 20,727.1. 
NEW MEXICO. 
Report for 1896, Amado Chaves, Territorial superintendent. 
Congratulation is made for the recent completion of the fine normal school build- 
ing at Silver City, for the notable improvement in school buildings in many of the 
towns, and for the high average in ability and faithfulness in the teaching force. 
Howe institutions are turning out graduates who, it is claimed, are the full equals of 
those who come with diplomas from the States, and the report warmly urges their 
more frequent relations to positions in the educational system. 
The report, considering the well-nigh impossibility of collecting the poll tax, 
argues that it be abolished altogether, and its collection, as all other taxes are, be 
devolved upon the county collector. It complains also that school superintendents 
are hampered by the limits set by the law upon their powers, which operate 
neither upon teachers nor directors whese abuses the superintendents are without 
any authority to suppress. It is contended that provision should be made whereby 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  NEW MEXICO—NEW YORK. 1337 
no contract shall be valid without approval by the superintendents, whose only 
power, as the law now stands, is to sign warrants for teachers’ salaries, whereag 
directors employ teachers, fix their salaries, and buy all supplies. Required by law 
to visit school districts annually, much of the superintendent’s salary is thus 
expended. 
‘The report recommends that some limit be fixed to the duration of teachers’ cer- 
tificates. 
Attention is again called to the inequable apportionment among the districts, and 
the claims of the Spanish language among those children whose vernacular it is. 
Some of the language in this appeal is even pathetic, and it certainly makes clear 
that in some of the districts acquaintance with that tongue is absolutely essential 
to teachers. 
The university, having abolished the subpreparatory classes, is doing reasonably 
well considering the lack of increase in its appropriations. So with the College of 
Agricultural and Mechanical Arts, the School of Mines, and the Institute for the 
Deaf, Dumb, and Blind. 
  NEW YORK. 
Report for 1895, Hon. Charles R. Skinner, State superintendent. 
While claiming steady advance in public education, the report admits that school 
supervision is lacking much in completeness and efficiency. The variously extensive 
functions of the commissioners render it difficult among so vast a number of appli- 
cants to avoid occasional mistakes in selecting. A bill was prepared and submitted 
to the present legislature providing for additional qualifications in candidates for 
commissioners, and increasing their salary; but the opposition of the commissioners 
themselves kept it in the senate committee. The report, with much earnestness, 
commends the subject to the next legislature, and will recommend that at least the 
standard of their education be raised and that experience alone, however long, be 
not regarded sufficient; and it recommended further that salaries of commissioners 
be not increased, without such rise in qualification being made obligatory. 
The report calls attention to the large number of weak rural districts, and the 
pressing need of consolidation. The following extract gives some noteworthy facts: 
“There are 2,751 school districts in the State where the total resident population 
of school age is less than 20, and there are 502 districts in the State where the total 
resident school population is less than 10. There were 7,529 school districts in this 
State where the average attendance upon instruction in the public schools during 
the last school year varied from 1 +o 20 pupils, while there were 2,893 where the 
average daily attendance was less than 10... . In 1860, the school population of 
the State, outside ofits cities, was 894,432. Atthe close of the school year of 1895 the 
school population of the State, outside of its cities and villages, containing upward 
of 10,000 people, was 609,146—a decrease of 285,286, or upward of 31 per cent, while 
the number of school districts in 1860 was 11,358. While the number-of school 
children has decreased during that time nearly one-third, there has been substan- 
tially no decrease in the number of rural districts, et 
Then the report proceeds to argue that the township, or some unit larger than the 
present, is indispensable. Meanwhile, these small districts should be consolidated 
with larger, and transportation furnished to those pupils residing at inconvenient 
distance from the schoolhouses. 
Several changes are recommended for a more effective operation of the compulsory 
school law, among them that attendance officers be appointed by town boards, and 
their jurisdiction extend ever all the school districts in the town not provided with 
such officers, and the compensation be a town charge, and that any persons commit- 
ting «a truant have power, when seeming advisable, to parole him 
The report argues that it is as important that examinations and licenses of teach- 
ers for ¢ity public schools be under State supervision as those in rural districts. 
While there is no general law fixing a standard of qualification, the evident need of 
it has led to its voluntary adoption in quite a number of the cities. The report 
maintains that out of the nearly $13,000,000 paid annually to teachers, not a dollar 
should be paid to one who does ‘‘not hold a certificate of some form, issued under 
the regulations of the State department of publicinstruction;” and itadds: ‘‘ Dur- 
ing the school year ending July 31, 1895, 12, 530 teachers were employed some portion 
of the school year in the public schools of the cities of this State, and the State had 
nothing to say in determining the qualifications of 10,966 of these teachers.” 
Much benefit is claimed to have resuited from the uniform system of examination 
of teachers, but some modifications in the issuance of licenses are suggested as 
advisable, as well as that uniformity should be in the time of expiration of certificates. 
An important movement was in the establishment of a School of Pedagogy in con- 
nection with Cornell University.

  1338 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
A large number of decisions in appeal cases is subjoined and elaborate reports of 
operations in all departments. 
1896. 
The report for 1896 is from the same superintendent, Hon. Charles R. Skinner. 
It speaks in high praise of last year’s operations, claiming that ‘the outlook for 
the future was never brighter.” Yet there has been inevitable and expected decline 
in rural schools owing to continuance of influences hereinbefore mentioned. The dis- 
trict system has been condemned about unanimously by superintendents for many 
years, and in several other States it has given away to the township. The average of 
attendance in. more than 3,500 of these districts is not over 10 pupils. The law pro- 
vides for the consolidation of many of these, but is hindered by local sentiment, 
which is satisfied to cling to the past with all of its clumsiness, This sentiment 
seems almost obdurate in such a case as the following: - 
“One of the officials of this department reports visiting a conntry school in com- 
pany with the school commissoner of the district, and finding there a teacher at 
work on a piece of embroidery, but with no pupils in attendance. Inquiry elicited 
the information that the school had been insession three weeks without any pupils, 
and that there were only two children of school age in the entire district, both of 
whom were expected to attend the school later on.” 
The normal schools are represented as doing finely, between 9,000 and 10,000 being 
enrolled in all departments. So the training schools. The report says that with 
existing abundant facilities for training teachers, there is no present demand for 
additional normals. 
With the growing sentiment that commissioners should have teaching experience, 
a large majority of those elected in the preceding November were thus qualified. 
Among the most efficient in this force are several women whose work has been done 
with entire satisfaction. There is a growing general demand that the salaries of 
these officials be raised to a degree that will attract attention from those whose 
qualifications are well known to be entirely adequate. 
By a law of 1895 the minimum course of study in the high schools has been made 
three years, and the report makes suggestion of several matters that should be put 
in the minimum of requirement for entrance, Thesame legislature put the minimum 
of age among teachers at 18 years, 
There are a few of what are called “exempt districts,” wherein local authorities 
claim the right to examine and license teachers. These districts, fifteen in number, 
have given considerable annoyance to the department of superintendence which 
insists that the power of licensing should be uniform and be vested in the State 
department of public instruction. It is plainly said that the weakest feature in the 
school system is the different standards employed in different cities. Out of the 
thirty-four cities in the State as many as twenty-four have adopted uniformity 
voluntarily. 
The compulsory-education law is said to be productive of much good, and some 
suggestions are made of matters wherein it 1s in need of additional enactments. 
Libraries, under generous appropriations, are growing with much rapidity and 
dispensing great benefits.      
  BROOKLYN SCHOOL REPORT. 
Report for 1895, William H. Maxwell, superintendent. 
The number of pupils instructed was 145,998, a gain of 9,497. Per cent of attend- 
ance rose to 71.1, while the average number of pupils toa teacher is yet exorbitantly 
high (being 70 in the lowest primary grade), yet it is considerably lower than a year 
ago, when in that grade it was 77. 
ihe following is sufficiently plain language about the glut in a certain class of 
officials: 
“ Within the schools there is now a supervisor-principal, or head of department, 
who is not responsible for the work of a class, to about every ten class teachers, 
As Ihave separately pointed out, this system is extremely expensive. Supervision 
within the schools now costs more in Brooklyn than in any other city in the country, 
with the exception, perhaps, of New York. The expense of this system, however, 18 
oniy one of the arguments against it. The multiplication of supervisors has with- 
drawn many of our best class teachers from the active work of teaching to the great 
detriment of our schools, and without adequate compensatory benefit. Further- 
more, it has been the fruitful parent of unseemly wire-pulling for place, bickering, 
and jealousies that interfere seriously with the work of many schools. There would 
be decided gain in efficiency, and a decided saving in cost, if one-half of the heads 
of departments were set to work teaching classes.”

  NEW YORK. 1339 
It is regarded a salutary law of 1895 that the course of study in the Girls’ High 
School shall be approved by the State superintendent, so as to make their graduate3 
able to enter the training school for teachers. This has served to raise to four 
years the course heretofore limited to three. Girls are now admitted to the manual 
training high school which the report believes should have been coeducational 
from the beginning. 
Earnest appeal is made for additional high schools, the superintendent contending 
that ao should be at least six for the support of which provision is entirely prac- 
ticable. 
There are some interesting things in the report about principals’ certificates, in 
the various grades. Congratulation is indulged in for increased school attendance, 
which is due partly to increased school accommodations and partly to the enforce- 
ment of the compulsory law. ‘The truant school, under careful management, is 
proving a blessing. 
The report argues for manual training in elementary schools, and concludes thus: 
“The tasks that lie immediately before us comprise the building of new school- 
houses, to the end that every child of school age in this city, may, with proper sur- 
roundings, and under proper conditions, have the opportunities for education that 
modern life demands, the establishment of kindergartens for children between 5 
and 6 years of age; the extension of our high-school system, the provision for manual 
training—sewing and cooking for girls and sloyd work for boys—in the grammar 
schools, and the weeding out of inefficient teachers.”   
BUFFALO SCHOOL REPORT, 
Report for 1895, Henry P. Emerson, superintendent of education. 
The registry of children in the public schools shows 46,665, a gain over last year of 
1,952. The frequent assertion that there are as many as from 10,000 to 20,000 children 
in the city who do not attend schools of any sort, the superintendent denies, arguing 
that many children are not sent to school until 7 years old and past. “It may be 
stated with confidence,” he says, “that there are not more than 1,000 within the 
meaning of the compulsory law.” Regarding this law the superintendent contends 
that great caution should be used in its enforcement. Unexceptional vigor some- 
times puts a hardship upon families for whose support the werk of its children are 
indispensable. He contends that the city ought to create and maintain a distinct 
institution for detention of incorrigible truants and their reformation. It is believed 
that such an institution would prevent the incipiency of truancy in very many 
cases, as boys, foreseeing imprisonment therein, would avoid it by resorting to the 
schools as a choice of evils. 
In the interest of economy, the grades have been reduced from ten to nine, some 
unnecessary positions in schools abolished, and other such work been done. It has 
been necessary, however, to construct eight new buildings and put annexes to sey- 
eral others; five other new buildings have been ordered, yet there is need of more 
because of the continual rapid increase of school population. 
Free text-books, within the two years of operation, have proved a great benefit, 
shown in increased attendance, more speedy organization, holding pupils longer in 
schools, and preventing dwindling in the upper grades. Besides, books are better 
preserved and their cost greatly diminished. 
Under a law of the last legislature, all applicants for teachers’ positions after Jan- 
uary 1, 1897, must have had at least three years’ successful experience in teaching, 
or have graduated from a high school, academy, or other equally ranking institu- 
tion, and had at least one year of professional training. The act also provides for 
the maintenance in cities of one or more classes for such professional instruction. 
The superintendent intends to ask also for the establishment of a teachers’ training 
class in connection with the high school, the sessions, if appearing necessary, to be 
held in afternoons. He contends that it is in the high school chiefly that “the 
young,” to use his own words, ‘become imbued with that civic pride, that public 
spirit, so essential in the preparation of city teachers.” 
‘The report makes an earnest appeal for the creation of a teachers’ retirement fund, © 
not only in behalf of humanity, but for the sake of more easily obtained relief from 
continuance in the profession of teachers who have become superannuated, and who, 
with the infirmity of mind common in far advanced age, are unconscious of decay 
and regard it a hardship when asked or forced to retir 
  The report speaks of the defects inherent in the graded system, of promotions 
which necessarily take insufficient note of the numerous inequalities in pupils’ 
understandings and development, and gives some changes which it was believed 
important to make in the matter. 
Doubts concerning the value of manual training in schools have heretofore hin- 
dered any general demand for it. Yet, a small beginning was made during the year,

the results of which thus far are too indefinite to be noted in the report. Yetitis 
believed important to introduce sewing into the schools, and steps to that end are 
being taken. 
Night schools show that registration and attendance are uniformly greatest dur- 
ing the first term. For this reason the opening is now postponed to October. 
Appended are full reports of school examiners, directors, subordinate superintend- 
ents, etc., and elaborate tables of statistics. 
NEW YORK CITY SCHOOL REPORT. 
Report for 1895, Sohn Jasper, city superintendent. 
The whole number of pupils taught during the year was 355,623. This is ascer- 
tained by counting the admissions to the several schools, every pupil counted as 
often as admitted. The average attendance was 188,575, an increase over the last 
year of 5,907, decrease being only in the evening and corporate schools. Besides the 
4,989 regular teachers, including principals, 129 were employed for the special teach- 
ing of drawing, music, German, French, sewing, cooking, physical exercise, and 
phonography. 
For several years past principals, except in very small schools, have been exempt 
from teaching and do only supervisory work. ‘They are made responsible for all 
matters in pedagogy and administration, the subordinate teachers being guided by 
them exclusively. Violations of duty on the part of the teachers are reported to 
the committee on instruction. No unfavorable action is taken on such reports with- 
out giving a hearing to the teacher accused. The rule allows also the city super- 
intendent on his own motion to report any case of dereliction coming within his 
personal observation. 
The law forbids corporal punishment in every form in the public schools, substi- 
tuting suspension in cases incorrigible by mor@l suasion. Every principal has the 
right to suspend a pupil, and must give immediate notice of such action to the 
parent or guardian, reporting to the city superintendent and the chairman of 
the board of trustees of the ward. A right of appeal to those trustees within ten 
days is allowed, and their decision is reported to the city superintendent, whose duty, 
in case of no appeal or its dismissal, it is to notify the principal of every other 
school for the same sex, of the name of the pupil thus suspended. Readmission is 
allowed upon proof of amendment satisfactory to,the superintendent. 
We quote the following under the head ‘School accommodations” : 
“For a number‘of years the steady development of business in certain localities, 
the demolition of dwellings, and the consequent transfer of the residents to other 
parts of the city enable the school authorities to judge with accuracy the probable 
necessity for the erection of additional school buildings. Of late years the varied 
immigration, combined with a decided tendency to ‘colonize’ a special part of the 
city, has led to the removal of old dwelling houses and the erection of large tenements 
intended to house many more persons. As a result some of the lower wards had 
shown an abnormal increase in the school population—schools which, but five years 
ago, were fully adequate to the wants of the neighborhood have been filled to their 
utmost capacity and have refused many applicants for admission. In this connection 
it is important to note the fact that, although but 35 per cent of the attendance is 
in the schools below Fourteenth street, more than 47 per cent of the nonadmissions 
through lack of room were found in those schools. The whole number of such non- 
admissions in the city during the year 1895 was 24,000, of which more than 11,000 
were in the down-town wards.” The growth has been great, especially in the 
Eleventh, Twelfth, Seventh, Tenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-second, and Twenty-third 
wards. 
During the year manual training was established in two additional schools. It is 
pursued now in eighteen grammar schools and twenty-five primary schools. Sewing 
is taught in all the female departments of the manual training schools, and to the 
girls in the first, second, and third primary grades in all primary schools for at least 
one hour in the week. Praise is bestowed upon the results of the introduction of 
cookery. The superintendent recommends the introdiction of new appliances and 
of charts showing the cuts of meats and specimens of the several food products. 
Three additional kindergartens were established within the past year, the whole 
number now being ten. 
The register of pupils in the evening schools was 25,922, average attendance at 
which was 35 per cent. Formerly the evening high schools were under the control of 
the committee on evening schools, but during the last year they were put under the 
city superintendent. Under his direction several changes in regulations have been 
made and the standard of scholarship elevated. The number of students registered 
was 6,977, average attendance 2,571. The evening is divided into two sessions, each 
an hour long. Each pupil has one, but may not have over two studies which he 
elects. :

  NEW YORK. 1341 
Generous provisions have been made for teachers placed upon the retired list. On 
a recommendation of the city superintendent, and a two-thirds vote of the board, 
those women who have taught thirty years, and those men who have taught thirty- 
five, receive an annuity of half their salaries, provided they do not exceed $1,000. 
They are empowered, however, when appearing proper, to reduce the annuities, the 
reduction being required to be at the same rate per annum. 
A considerable number of institutions styled corporate schools, as they participate 
in the school revenues, are under the general superintendence of the board of educa- 
tion. The report says of these: 
“The instruction and the discipline in the schools of these institutions and societies 
were, as arule, quite satisfactory, and the State law prohibiting sectarian instruc- 
tion and the use of sectarian text-books appeared to have been complied with.” 
Among the recommendations in the report is that on completion of the highest 
primary schools fitness of pupils for the grammar schools should be determined by 
the principals of the former; first, because such mode of promotion is that used from 
grade to grade in any department, and because it would prevent competitive exami- 
nations for schools which have insufficient accommodations. Another recommenda- 
tion is for semiannual examinations in the grammar schools, from the fact that every 
grade, except the first grammar, is completed at the end of each half year. 
ROCHESTER SCHOOL REPORT. 
Report for 1896, Milton Noyes, superintendent of instruction. 
It claims a larger number of school organizations than ever before, and increased 
daily attendance of pupils. 
A noteworthy fact it is that during the year, in the intermediate grades, pupils 
have been encouraged to submit to the superintendent short stories written by them- 
selves upon subjects presented to them.» The development of originality by such 
exercises has been very apparent. An additional fact of importance is the habit of 
taking pupils in the ninth grade to visit industrial and manufacturing establish- 
ments in the city. 
While the report does not undervalue industrial training—sewing, stenography, 
and the like—yet it doubts the necessity of introducing them into the public schools, 
particularly as the Mechanics Institute is in every way adapted for instructing in 
them. The following extract is from the remarks made by the report on the relative 
increase of pupils and teachers: 
“During the time that the number of pupils has increased 100 per cent, the num- , 
ber of teachers has increased 300 per cent. ‘The average number of pupils to teachers 
istoosmall. From a financial standpoint the increase is extravagant. ... There 
is a correct average in these matters, which may be arrived at by reducing the whole 
of the teaching force, and asking all instructors to complete correcting work and 
necessary reviews after the dismissal of grades.” The report insists that, admitting 
the fact that in small classes instruction may be better than in large, yet in this case 
the average could be enlarged without subtracting from the efficiency of instruction. 
It is a noteworthy fact that of the graduates of the university with honors 40 per 
cent were free academy students. 
The enrollment of registered pupils for the year showed 22,518, an increase of 
about 800 over the year previous. This does not include 1,705 enrolled in the 
evening schools. 
The school for truants was efficiently maintained, the pupils being constantly 
under the supervision of a male teacher and an attendant. None were received who 
had been convicted of any crime, great or small. A good exhibit of the work was 
made at the end of the year. Besides usual text-books pupils were furnished with 
reading matter and manual training imparted. Children between 7 and 16 years who 
are habitual truants may be sent either to a truant school or an orphans’ home under 
charge of those having the same religious faith as their parents, 
Four evening schools were maintained, but complaint is made of great irregularity 
of attendance. Out of 1,705 enrolled the average attendance being only 133. 
An additional kindergarten was started, being the eleventh.   
    
SYRACUSE SCHOOL REPORT. 
Report for 1995, A.B, Blodgett, superintendent. 
The suggestion of the preceding report regarding the taking of a more accurate 
census of school population was complied with, but in a very unsatisfactory way. 
Efforts are being made to introduce an efficient system of manual training, and a 
line of work has been begun supplemental to at least the work done in the High 
School. Attention is again called to the continual unsatisfactory condition of the 
High School building.
-P-A-G-E-214
  1342 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Evening schools come in again for high praise, in which the work done is equal to 
the best done elsewhere in the city. It is earnestly hoped that a larger number will 
seek the advantages of an institution in which so much good is being imparted. 
Kindergartens are growing apace, the Porter School, the Solve ay Circle, and 
another newly started, phaving been adopted by the board of education. 
In the matter of compulsory education not much has been done thus far. Says 
the report: 
“A truant officer has been named, and in some measure has succeeded in awaken- 
ing the truants and the people to tho fact that the law is present, and that another 
year will see it properly and fully enforced. A. truant school, without which all 
effort will fail, will be provided, and then, but not till then, will this city see the 
value of this long desired legislation.” 
The report regrets the long continued delay in the matter of new furniture for 
the schools which has been clearly shown to be solely needed. 
The whole number of registered pupils is 16,657, an increase of 581; average daily 
attendance, 12,578. 
NORTH CAROLINA. 
Report for 1895 and 1896, Hon. John C. Scarborough, State superintendent. 
The report begins with a candid appeal for greater State aid for the public schools. 
“T recommend,” says the superintendent, ‘‘as large increase of school taxes direct 
by the legislature for the support of free schools as the legislature may find it pos- 
sible to levy, and leave a sufficient margin for the necessary expenses of the State 
and county governments.” 
Referring again to the fact that the constitution actually commands that one or 
more public schools in every school district shall be maintained at least four months 
in the year, and the further fact that they are maintained less than thirteen weeks. 
He shows by figures that 9} cents on $100 in addition to the present rate of 18 cents 
asat present existing, making 27; cents is indispensable for making practicable 
compliance with the requirements of the constitution. 
“Therefore,” it is said plainly, “every odd and end not necessary for State and 
county purposes with economical management ought to be ext off and placed to the 
free public school fund in order that good public schools may be placed in easy reach 
of every citizen’s home and means. We ought not to play any longer with this 
_question of schools for our people.” 
And then the following is added: 
“After this shall be done—and it must be done if we aro to discharge our duty 
under the constitution—and every dollar possible turned into the school fund by 
school tax levied directly by the legislature, we will still need more money for the 
public schools—‘the neighborhood schools’—in reach of every citizen, Then a sys- 
tem of local taxes from schools must be made effective if we would lead onr people 
to more interest in the education of the children for citizenship.” 
To this end it is recommended that certain sections under the*laws of 1889, which 
included only particular localities, should be made applicable | to all the counties, and 
elections ordered to be held in what are termed “off years,” so as to remove them 
from the influence of the partisanism and general excitement of political. campaigns. 
It is a subject of much regret that not more interest is taken by the people at large 
toward making school terms longer and the work dene in them more efficient. Eyen 
private schools are ‘‘crippled,” sometimes destroyed altogether by poor public 
schools. Parents send their children what little time the schoolhouses are open and 
then content themselves with the thought that they are getting all that is to be had. 
These private s: hools, haying only about 7 per cent of school children, are frequently 
closing for lack of adequate support, and the only safeguard against the present 
young ¢ “generation growing up in ignorance is in the publie schools, sadly in want as 
they are of more generons legislative aid. The spirit of the people has at length 
grown to be insympathy with the public schools, and would hail with gratitic ation 
whatever would tend to make them more efficient. 
The legislature of 1895 abolished the county superintendency and the separate 
county boards of education. The superintendent considers this a mistake, and 
recommends their reestablishment as well as some sort of provision for more effec- 
tive and practical system of county teachers’ institutes. 
County commissioners, with no executive officer at their head, can not possibly 
manage all the multiform affairs in the system. Instead of the good results antici- 
pated by those through whose agencies these county boards and county superin- 
tendents and teachers’ institutes were abolished the report says: 
“On the other hand, the school interest has languished, the teachers have failed to 
make progress, the school districts, left to themselves, have multiplied.neighborhood 
disputes, communities have been hopelessly div: ided, and confusion reigns in many

places for the want of k wise executive officer to settle matters and to urge forward 
educational sentiment and work, and to put teachers on lines of study and improve- 
ment of their responsible work.” 
Tho report suggests that the State superintendent be directed to divide the State 
into sixteen institute districts, with six counties to each district, with a conductor 
at the head of each district, charged to hold once in the year one institute of a 
week’s length in each of the counties, conducted during the six consecutive weeks 
of the period, attendance on which institute should be made obligatory upon all 
teachers. It is estimated that the whole cost of such institutes would not exceed 
$3,000 or $3,500. 
Regarding the normal schools for colored teachers, the report suggests that instead 
of all the seven existing being consolidated into one they remain separate as they 
are. On this head it says: 
“These schools have been of immeasurable benefit to the village and country 
public schools for negro children by supplying those schools with teachers reason- 
ably well prepared for such work and in touch with the people whose children they 
are to teach. There are seven of these schools now, receiving annually the aggregate 
sum of $10,000. I recommend that these seven schools be given $2,000 each.” 
As it is, these schools have a pupilage of 1,000. If consolidated into one, this 
would reach hardly above 200. 
Usual reports are submitted by the board of directors, and the president of the 
Normal and Industrial School at Greensboro. Attendance of pupils keeps on the 
inerease, ninety-three of the counties being represented. Many applicants are 
denied admission for lack of accommodation. 
NORTH DAKOTA. 
Report for 1895 and 1896, Emma F. Bates, State superintendent of public instruction. 
Since Dakota became a State the number of school children has increased from 
40,000 to 67,000. The only institution of higher learning there was the State Uni- 
versity. Besides this there are now two normal schools, the Agricultural College, 
and the Deaf and Dumb School. 
It is considered a mistake was made in changing the time for election of county 
superintendents, which, together with that of other school officials, theretofore was 
in the month of June. The change was made to the date of election of the general 
county officers, which takes place in the fall of the year. Objection is stated in 
these words: 
“This has been universally regretted as a move backward for education, since it 
makes the county superintendent thus much more a part of partisan political 
machinery, and makes it less likely that a person of educational merit is chosen, and 
more impossible to separate educational matters from the influence of baser peliti- 
cians who desire to use the educational offices for partisan purposes.” It is added: 
“A few counties have too large territory and too many teachers to make personal 
supervision by the superintendent either possible or efficient. These should be 
divided into superintendents’ districts and have another superintendent, for the 
most effective work is in the personal inspection and supervision by a capable county 
superintendent.” 
In view of the great number of teachers in the State who from lack of training 
are inefficient for their work, the legislature at its session of 1895 passed a law in 
accordance with which the high school board formulated a system and a course of 
study. Of this board the State superintendent is a member, and she states that with 
only two exceptions the advanced schools are employing it in endeavors to elevate 
their rank as high as possible. The value to the State from the uniformity destined 
to result from such action is twofold— 
“First, because the schools themselves are better; second, because, since many 
district school teachers have only a high-school preparation, the better the high school 
the better will be this class of teachers.” 
Liberal appropriations, however, will be necessary to make the system satisfactorily 
efficient. 
The normal schools thus far have been crowded with grammar-grade students for 
academical preparation, instead of (what would be far better) with high-school gradu- 
ates and others holding second and third rate certificates, who resort there only for 
the purpose of being trained in the art of teaching. This latter would redound far 
better to the benefit of the rural schools which, it is claimed, should be the principal 
aim of the normal schools. 
While there has been marked improvement in rural schoolhouses newly constructed, 
yet the superintendent, like her predecessor, urges greater attention to sanitary con- 
ditions and cleanliness. A )ill drafted by herself on this subject was passed by the 
legislature of 1895, known as the health and decency law. The following language 
is pointed and earnest: 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  1344 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
“The operative effects of this law have been highly gratifying. Where a few dis- 
tricts fail to comply with its requirements the failure is due to the laxity on the part 
of county superintendents. It is simple and easily enforced. This isa fieldin which 
women are needed as self-appointed committees and as school directors to see that 
this law which touches the morals of their children is enforced. Directors may 
build according to law, but someone else must see to its enforcement as to the clear, 
chaste, and wholesome part... .” 
Then she quotes these words of Horace Mann: 
“A want of decency enforced upon boys and girls will become physical and moral 
turpitude in men and women.” 
Another means of promoting the well-being of children in this behalf was devised 
by the superintendent in 1895. The following, after some preliminary argument of 
the matter, is what she says: 
“The coming together of parents, children, officers, and teachers in the schools on 
a given day, which shall be devoted to exercises in honor and praise of the home 
and family, and the inculcation of personal virtues, seems to me eminently fitting. 
With these thoughts in mind, I designated June 26 as Parents’ Day in the public 
schools of North Dakota for 1896. This day was well observed, with gratifying 
results.” 
Complaint is made, under the head of ‘Scientific temperance,” that the law touch- 
ing alcohol and narcotics, is not very often complied with except in the letter, while 
the spirit of it is not fulfilled. i 
Regret is expressed for comparative futility of effort to secure the passage of a free 
and uniform text-book bill. A modified bill was passed, though compliance with it 
was left optional with the several districts. A few adopted it and results have been 
so evidently beneficial that it is hoped that in time it may become universal. 
Recommendation is made in the report that a law be enacted providing that a board 
of examiners be hereafter appointed by the department of public instruction, and 
another to make office of commissioner of university and school lands a position of 
trust in the department of State, and the occupant an elegtive official. 
OHIO. 
HISTORY OF PUBLIC EDUCATION IN OHIO FOR FIFTY YEARS.! 
BY EMERSON E. WHITE, LL.D. 
Té is said that the sketch of a man’s life should begin with his grandfather. 
Whatever may be true in biography, the history of an epoch necessarily includes 
the movements that led to it. 
For nearly a score of years after the admission of Ohio into the Union, the people 
were under the impression that the revenues to be derived from the immense area of 
school lands would be ample to support not only common schools but also needed 
higher institutions; or, to use the expression of the time, to ‘disseminate instruc- 
tion.” But unanticipated difficulties were experienced in leasing school lands, and 
so in 1821 the first law providing for a school tax in Ohio was passed. This pioneer 
school law also provided for the division of the townships into school districts, 
when approved by a vote ef the electors, and the election of a committee of three 
by the householders in each district. This district committee was authorized, on 
agreement of two-thirds of the householders, to cause the building of a school- 
house, to employ a teacher (the committee being judge of his qualifications) and to 
make assessments for expenses, The option given by the law to the electors largely 
defeated its purpose. i : 
‘This pioneer law unfortunately recognized the school district, and not the town- 
ship, as the unit of school organization and control, and it took near seventy years 
to eliminate this serious defect from the school laws of Ohio. 
The law enacted in 1825, usually referred to as ‘‘ the first school law of Ohio, 
was mandatory in its provisions. It made it the duty of the trustees of ev 
organized township to lay off the same into school districts, as a condition of receiv- 
ing any portion of the county tax provided for in the law, and this mandatory 
provision was reenacted five times in thirteen years. The act of 1825 also provided 
for the annual election of three school directors in each district; and made it their 
duty to build a schoolhouse, to employ a teacher, to manage and superintend the 
school, to make needed assessments, and to receive and expend allfunds. A pen- 
alty was affixed for a failure to employ a teacher. The law provided for county 
examiners to determine the qualifications of teachers. The school law of 1825 was 
prepared by Nathan Guilford, of Cincinnati, and, though much amended, it remained 
in force thirteen years. ”

In 1837 the general assembly enacted a law creating the office of superintendent 
of common Raraois of Ohio, and four days later, with equally rare wisdom, elected 
Samuel Lewis, of Cincinnati, to the office thus created. It is an interesting coinci- 
dence that three months after Mr. Lewis’s election, Horace Mann was appointed 
secretary of the State board of education of Massachusetts. The impulse and 
direction which Mr. Mann gave to popular education in Massachusetts, Mr. Lewis 
paralleled for a time in Ohio, and with equal self-sacrifice and devotion. 
Though his salary was only $500 a year (not sufficient to pay traveling expenses), 
Mr. Lewis entered at once upon a field campaign. He traveled the first year over 
1,500 miles, most of the distance on horseback, visited 300 schools, and 40 county 
seats, organizing associations of teachers, and everywhere awakening an increased 
popular interest in good schools. 
In the first year of his administration, he prepared and secured the enactment of 
the law of 1838, the most advanced school law then enacted in any State. It contin- 
ued the office of State superintendent of common schools, increasing the term of 
office to five years and the annual salary to $1,200. It made the township clerk 
superintendent of the schools of his township, with the duty of visiting each 
school at least once a year and examining all matters “ touching the situation, dis- 
cipline, mode of teaching, and improvement thereof ;” also with the duty of making 
annually the estimates necessary for providing ‘at least six months of good school- 
ing.” The law also made the county auditor superintendent of schools with 
important duties. It not only provided for a more effective organization of the 
schools in the townships, with statistical reports, but it also provided for the 
organization of the schools in incorporated cities and towns not under special 
charters. ‘ 
Mr. Lewis’s three annual reports to the general assembly are remarkable docu- 
ments, advocating with intelligence and force most of the plans for the improve- 
ment of schools since adopted. He edited for one year the Common School Director, 
a monthly journal published at the expense of the State. 
‘The same year in which Mr. Lewis entered upon his duties as State superintendent 
of schools Prof. Calvin E. Stowe, of Lane Seminary, presented to the general 
assembly his noted report on Elementary Education in Europe, special attention 
being given to methods of instruction in the elementary schools of Germany. A 
copy of this epoch-making report was sent to every school district in Ohio, and it 
was also republished and circulated by the legislatures of other States. Professor 
Stowe’s report and the three annual reports of Superintendent Lewis were fruitful 
seed in a virgin soil, and, as will be shown later, the next decade garnered rich 
haryests of fruitage. Scores of school officers and teachers were thereby imbued 
with the spirit of progress and fired with zeal in their work. 
At the close of his third year Superintendent Lewis felt constrained to resigu his 
office. The reactionists in school affairs were, unfortunately, in control of the general 
assembly, and an unwise effort was made to abolish the office. As a compromise 
measure the duties of the office were imposed upon the secretary of state. ‘This 
backward step greatly discouraged the friends of free schools, and the next five 
years witnessed a marked decline in popular interest in school progress, though 
each succeeding secretary of state advocated one or more important measures of 
school reform. 
But the cities and more important towns were fully enlisted in the improvement 
of their schools. Cincinnati, acting under a special law, divided its schools into 
two grades or departments as early as 1836, and in 1840 a graded course of study 
with five grades was adopted—one of the first elementary courses of study in the 
United States. Cleveland, acting under a special law, divided its schools into two 
departments (‘‘ primary” and ‘‘senior”) in 1840 and in 1846 established a high 
school, with Andrew Freese principal—the first public high school in Ohio. The 
same year the schools were divided into five grades, designated as primary, second- 
ary, intermediate, grammar, and high. Dayton obtained a special charter in 1841 
and under its provisions the schools were divided into four grades, designated as 
primary, secondary, junior, and senior. No high school was established until 1850. 
Columbus was made a separate district by a special law in 1845, and three school- 
houses were built the next year. Early in 1847 the board of education created the 
office of superintendent of public schools and, with commendable wisdom, elected 
Dr. A. D. Lord to the position. Dr. Lord entered upon his duties in May, 1847, 
being the first city superintendent of schools in Ohio and one of the first in the 
country. Portsmouth obtained a special law in 1839 and in 1840 its schools were 
divided into three departments, with A. L. Child principal. In_ 1844 the schools 
were divided into four grades, with Andrew J. Rickoff principal. Sandusky, Massil- 
Jon, Norwalk, and other enterprising towns early obtained special laws and began 
earnestly the work of school improvement. 
In 1847 the citizens of Akron obtained a special law “‘for the support and better 
regulation of common schools in the town,” and the next year the general assembly 
ED 97. 85

gave the council of any city er town authority to adopt tho Akron law on the peti- 
tion of two-thirds of its voters. In 1849 the general assembly passed “A general law 
for the schools in cities and towns.” This advanced act, drawn by Hon. 8. T. 
Worcester, of Norwalk, gave boards of education power to establish high schools 
peel as lower grades and to determine the branches of study to be taught in the 
schools. 
The “Akron law” and the “law of 1849” gave a strong impetus to the movement 
for the better organization of public schools in cities and towns. The year 1850 
found over sixty cities and towns organized under their provisions, the schools graded 
(usually into five grades) and fairly classified. The schools in nearly a score of dis- 
tricts were under the direction of a superintendent. Dr. A. D. Lord was in Colum- 
bus and M. D. Leggett in Akron in 1847; Lorin Andrews in Massillon and M. F. 
Cowdery in Sandusky in 1848; John 8. Whitwill in Lancaster in 1849, and D. F. 
DeWolf in Norwalk and Nathan Guilford in Cincinnati in 1850. Andrew J. Rickoff 
was principal of the public schools of Portsmouth from 1844 to 1849, with the title 
of superintendent as early certainly as 1847. 
Two other important factors contributed to the great awakening in education 
which introduced the half century of progress now under view. 
In 1844 @ man of untiring activity and intense enthusiasm was elected secretary of 
state. This man for the hour was Samuel Galloway, of Columbus. Mr. Galloway 
recognized clearly the need of an educational revival, and to accomplish this result 
he utilized fully his position as ex officio State superintendent of schools. He was 
ably seconded by Dr. A. D. Lord, then principal of the Western Reserve Teachers’ 
Seminary at Kirtland, one of the first normal schools in the country, and by other 
influential men in different parts of the State, whose enthusiasm had been kindled by 
the secretary’s fiery zeal. 
In the first year ef Mr. Galloway’s great rally (1845) a teachers’ institute was held 
in Sandusky !—the first teachers’ institute held in the west and one of the first in the 
United States, and in October of the same year a second institute was held in 
Chardon. In 1846 nine teachers’ institutes were held in seven counties and the next 
year institutes were held in twelve counties. The number of institutes increased 
from year to year, and they did much to awaken popular interest in school improve- 
ment. Educational conventions and local teachers’ meetings were also held in 
different parts of the State. 
The question of organizing a State association of teachers was frequently dis- 
cussed in these gatherings of teachers, and the movement was earnestly supported 
by Mr. Galloway and also by the Ohio School Journal, edited by Dr. A.D. Lord. At 
tho teachers’ institutes held in Akron, Ashland, and Chardon in 1847 a committee, 
with M. F. Cowdery chairman, was appointed to consider the propriety of forming 
a State teachers’ association. A majority of this committee met and issued a call for 
a convention to be held in Akron December 30 and 31, 1847. The convention met 
and the Ohio Teachers’ Association was organized in a burst of enthusiasm, with 
Samuel Galloway as president and Thomas W. Harvey as secretary. Mr. Galloway 
was reelected and served as president for three successive years. 
It falls to Dr. Findley to tell the history of the association in these opening years. 
It must suffice for me to say that the association held two meetings annually and 
that the tide of enthusiasm rose from year to year, reaching high tide in 1851. This 
was 2 memorable year in the history of the association. The belief that the first 
eneral assembly under the new constitution would enact an efficient school law 
Intensified the zeal of its leading members, At the semiannual meeting in June 
Lorin Andrews, who had resigned his position in Massillon to become a “ common 
school missionary,” was unanimously pledged the support of the association, and for 
three years he was kept in the field as State agent, his salary being made good by 
members of the association—an action without precedent in the history of educational 
associations. 
At the annual meeting in December Mr. Lorin Andrews presented a report recom- 
mending the publication of a monthly educational journal. The report was adopted, 
and for eight years the association published the Ohio Journal of Education, the 
predecessor of the Ohio Educational Monthly. 
In 1854 Mr. Lorin Andrews submitted a report recommending the establishment of 
a normal school under the auspices of the association, and at the annual meeting in 
December Mr. Cyrus MeNeely offered to transfer to the association the building and 
grounds of his school at Hopedale, valued at $10,000, for the purposes of a normal 
school. The gift was accepted at the semiannual meeting in June, 1855, and a vig- 
orous effort made to raise an endowment fund. Under the inspiring leadership 
of such enthusiastic leaders as Lorin Andrews, M. F. Cowdery, I. W. Andrews, 
  
1 The first institute at Sandusky was conducted by Hon. Salem Town, of Ithaca, N. Y., assisted by 
Dr. A. D. Lord and M. F. Cowdery. The second institute was conducted by Dr. A. D. Lord, M. F. 
Cowdery, and M. D, Leggett. 
 
-P-A-G-E-219

A. D. Lord, and M. D. Leggett the association would have undertaken almost any 
enterprise. 
The financial enterprises undertaken by the association with so much confidence 
and enthusiasm. proved a heavy burden, and at the annual meeting in 1859 both 
the Journal of Education. and the McNeely Normal School were wisely transferred to 
private control. The indebtedness of the association was not fully paid until 1862. 
Tho great educational awakening which began in 1845 and in its progress organ- 
ized the State Teachers’ Association, put Lorin Andrews. in the field as a common 
school missionary, started the Ohio Journal of Education, and founded the McNeely 
Normal School, culminated in the enactment of the general school law of 1853. The 
law embodied several of the important measures which Mr, Andrews, Mr. Galloway, 
and others had advocated, and there was much rejoicing over its enactment. 
It. is thus.seen that the decade of 1845 to 1855 was a period of great importance in 
the history of public education in Ohio. No decade beforo or sinco has been charac- 
terized by such enthusiastic movement in the interest of public schools. It wasa 
decade of zeal and action. 
The next decade (1855-1865) opened. with the inauguration of the new school law. 
Every progressive feature was opposed in the general assembly, and it looked for a 
time as if the great measure would be destroyed by ill-considered amendments. The 
school directors.in the subdistriets (formerly separate districts) did not take kindly 
to thesharing of the management of the schools with the new township board of edu- 
cation. It kept the first commissioner's. pen. busy in answering the questions arising 
under the provisions of the law relating to townships, and he soon found it necessary 
to publish from month to month a series of “ official opinions”—a practice continued 
for years. The law was fortunately protected from. serious changes, the repeal of 
the school library section in 1860 excepted. The opening of the civil war, with the 
sudden prostration of business, invited harmful legislation, but the most unfayor- 
able amendment was the reduction of the State school tax to 1.3 mills. 
The several amendments to the school law in 1864, all prepared by the school com- 
missioner, were designed to lessen friction in the administration of the law and 
otherwise increase its efficiency. The three new provisions which were added have 
exerted a wide and salutary influence upon the schools. Tho first of these provided. 
a fund for the support of teachers’ institutes, the second created a State board of 
examiners, and the third added.a knowledge of the theory and practice of teaching 
to the requiremonts for a teacher's certificate. The fact that these several pro- 
visions, with slight modifications, are still in force is evidence of their practical 
value. No other agency prior to 1855 did as:much for the professional advancement 
of Ohio teachers as. the teachers’ institute, and. no other agency did more to awaken: 
and direct popular interest in.school progress.. The two teachers’ institutes held in 
1845 multiplied from year to year until 1855, when forty-one institutes were held, 
with an attendance of some 4,000 teachers. Until 1864 the expenses of the insti- 
tutes held were, asa rule, paid by those in attendance. Since 1864 the county 
institute fund has been sufficient to permit the holding of an annual institute, with 
competent instructors, in four-fifths of the counties, and in the other counties only 
a small additional tuition fee is required. It seems unnecessary to refer more at 
Jength to what the other two provisions have done for the improvement of teachers, 
The school legislation of 1864 was a long step forward in school progress. 
The next year the general assembly. opened the way for the adoption of an adequate 
system of normal training for the teachers of the State, but owing to divided coun- 
sels. in tho: profession in 1866 the long-coveted opportunity was permitted to pass 
unimproved and it has never returned. The establishment of a normal department 
in the Ohio University at Athens,and recently in the Ohio State University at Co- 
lumbus, is a. somewhat hopeful indication that the preparation of teachers for their 
great work may yet receive long-needed legislative action. The leading cities of 
the State have all established normal or training schools: for the fitting of their 
teachers, more especially for the elementary grades, but the teachers in the country 
schools are. still left to the professional crumbs afforded by the teachers’ institute 
and the inadequate normal advantages provided by private enterprise. Ohio is still 
a good way from the full recognition of the fact. that teaching is a pursuit that 
should be entered through the door of special training. 
The only important scheol legislation secured in the next decade (1865-1875) was 
ithe complete codification of school law in 1873. While this law did not contain 
lvery important new provisions it simplified the law of.1853, with its numerous 
amendments, and thus: rendered the administration of school affairs more certain 
land effective. The divorcement of boards of education in cities of the first class 
from the municipal legislation of such cities was an important measure. The giy- 
ling of all boards of education, including township boards, permissive power to 
lemploy a superintendent of scheols was an important amendment, but the town- 
ships, with very few exceptions, permitted it to remain a dead letter. 
During this decade repeated and earnest efforts were made to secure county super-

vision of schools and the adoption of the township system. But a strong opposition 
to these measures appeared in each general assembly, and the bills prepared by the 
successive commissioners and introduced were defeated. The commissioners in turn 
advocated the establishment of normal sciiools, but no well-digested bill was pre- 
pared or introduced into the general assembly, and no earnest effort was made to 
secure needed legislation. 
The centennial year found Ohio without a State normal school, without a system 
of supervision of the schools outside of its cities, and still blindly clinging to its 
complicated, inefficient township-subdistrict organization in allits counties. Instead 
of taking its place in the front rank of the States noted for progressive school legis- 
lation, where its early history had placed it, the educators of Ohio were humiliated 
by the fact that in such legislation their State was near the rear. The educational 
honor of the State was saved only by the splendid showing of the schools in its 
cities and towns. 
The next decade (1875-1885) brought a renewal of earnest efforts to secure ad- 
vanced school legislation, but without success. The most important amendments 
to the school law related to teachers’ certificates. Section 4066 was so amended in 
1881 as to give the State board of examiners power to issue professional certificates 
of a second grade, valid for ten years—a provision of doubtful utility, which was 
soon repealed. By the same act section 4081 was so amended as to give boards of 
examiners in cities power to grant certificates for one, two, three, five, and ten years, 
those issued for five and ten years being renewable without reexamination, at the 
discretion of the board of examiners, a certificate of higher professional g de than 
the nonrenewable ten-year certificate issued by the State board of examiners. 
The only general school legislation of special significance in the first five years 
of the next decade (1885- 1895) was the so-called “temperance law” of 1888, a law 
enjoining instruction on the nature and effects of alcoholic drinks and narcotics in 
all grades of schools. 
The most important amendment to the school law enacted in these five years related 
to teachers’ certificates. Commissioner Tappan secured, in 1888, a fuller recognition 
of teaching as a profession by placing a professional certilicate within the easy reach 
of every well-qualified teacher in the State. The State board of examiners were 
authorized to issue three grades of life certificates (the authority to issue ten-year 
certificates being revoked), and all other boards of examiners (county and city) were 
authorized to issue, under specified conditions, certificates valid for five years, renew- 
able without reexamination at the discretion of the examiners. Thus provision was 
made for two classes of professional certificates—one valid for life, issued by the 
State board, and the other for five years, renewable without reexamination, issued 
by county and city boards. This five-year renewable certificate was intended to be 
a professional certificate, and it is to be regretted that it is not so designated in the 
law. Every teacher holding this certificate should be recognized as a teacher of 
professional standing, and should be honored as such. There ought to be a score or 
more of such teachers in every county. 
It is feared that many county and city examiners have not used wisely either the 
power or the discretion conferred by this law. There seems to be a suspicion in the 
minds of too many examiners, if not a belief, that the only way to secure progress 
among teachers is to humiliate them by repeated examinations in the elementary 
branches, The only sure way to awaken and sustain a professional spirit among 
teachers is to honor it both by law and in practice. The history of legislation in 
Ohio regulating the examination and certification of teachers is a dreary history, 
evidently ‘‘to be continued.” 
The beneficent laws so far enacted in this closing decade of the nineteenth cen- 
tury mark a greater advance in school legislation than the entire third of a century 
that preceded it. Among these important acts relating to schools enacted in and 
since 1890 are (1) the so-called “ Workman law,” which makes the township, like the 
city and town, the unit in school administration—the most fruitful school legislation 
since 1853; (2) the “ Boxwell law,” providing for the graduation of the pupils in 
rural schools and their admission to near city or town high schools; (3) the law ‘to 
compel the elementary education of children” as strengthened and perfected in, 1893 ; 
(4) the law of 1894 giving women the right to vote and be voted for at election of 
school officers; and (5) the schoolbook law, with its option of free text-books. 
These several laws are too recent to be treated intelligently as history. No one 
of them has met with such persistent and unreasonable opposition as the “‘ Work- 
man Jaw.” In each of the two general assemblies succeeding its enactment a vigor- 
ous effort was made to abolish the township system and restore the township-sub- 
district complication which had been the special weakness of the school system since 
1853; but the failure of these efforts is an assurance that the new township system 
may be mitted to work out its beneficent results. Its repeal would be little less 
shan a ¢ er to rural school improvement. 
Two cases of special legislation for cities in this last decade deserve mention. In 
          
        
-P-A-G-E-221
OHIO. 1349 
1887 the general assembly gave the superintendent of schools of Cincinnati the power 
to appoint all teachers by and with the consent of the board of education; the power 
to dismiss teachers without the board’s action; and made the superintendent’s 
approval necessary to the adoption of text-books. It also enacted that the members 
of the board should not as individuals or as local committees exercise supervisory 
authority over the schools. This was an unprecedented recognition of the authority 
and function of supervision. 
In the reorganization of the public schools of Cleveland in 1892, the superintendent 
was authorized to appoint or remove teachers, and to exercise complete supervisory 
authority in all matters pertaining to instruction and discipline, the selection of 
text-books excepted. Many of the duties usually intrusted to the board of educa- 
tion, including the appointment of the superintendent, were devolved upon a school 
director, elected by the people. 
The limits of this paper forbid any attempt to review the progress made in school 
administration, instruction, and discipline in the fifty years since this association 
was organized. On the introduction of graded schools into the cities and towns the 
perfection of the system as a mechanism largely absorbed attention. The “system” 
assumed often the importance of an end, and it was too often administered on the 
theory that the pupils existed for the system, not the system for the pupils. The 
absorbing fascination was uniformity —nniformity of studies, uniformity of progress, 
uniformity of results. Two resulting errors in the direction of mechanism possessed 
the schools. One of these was the fixed year interval between classes and the other 
the stated written examination to determine the promotion of pupils at the close of 
the year. These two features necessitated uniformity of progress not only by the 
individual pupils in every class, but by all the classes in each grade. This required 
uniform progress assumed that the several classes in a grade in city schools possess 
equal ability and are taught by teachers of equal skill—conditions that exist in no 
graded schools. It occurred often that classes that could have completed the course 
of study for the grade as early as April were kept ‘(marking time” until the annual 
promotion in June. 
For years the year interval between classes and the stated promotion examinations 
held the graded schools of cities in their grasp. ‘They narrowed and grooved the 
instruction, encoureged and rewarded mechanical and memoriter methods, and 
emphasized all the lumber of the text-books. This antagonism between the mechan- 
ism of the graded system and rational methods of teaching was early felt by intelli- 
gent and progressive teachers, and for twenty years past praiseworthy efforts have 
been made to free the schools from this procrustean bondage. The reforms of the 
past twelve years are a promise that this sacrifice of the opportunity of pupils on 
tho altar of uniformity and system will soon find a practical remedy. 
The first hundred years of Ohio’s history as a State will be but three years short 
when the nineteenth century closes. Is this century of marvelous progress to close 
with no State normal school in Ohio, and with the great majority of its rural schools 
without supervision? The two imperative needs he reral school are professional 
training for its teachers and intelligent and efficient supervision. Is it not possible 
to sce these two great measures of school improvement happily inaugurated before 
the State celebrates its first centennial? 
    OHIO SCHOOL REPORT. 
Report for 1895, Hon. Oscar T. Corson, State commissioner. 
    The county schools on their new career of better organization and management 
are improving. I1t is admitted that there are many very poor schools in the sub- 
districts. Yet the increased public interest, evinced by investigation of the question 
of supervision promises betterment. Notwithstanding the opposition of many to the 
Workman law before referred to, among opponents are quite a number who favor 
supervision. Yet it is argued that this can be made practicable only by making the 
township the educational unit, and thus centering responsibility in the management 
of the system in one board of education. The existence of two such boards hereto- 
fore was always embarrassing from want of harmony and from divided responsi- 
bility. It is absolutey essential that both superintendent and teacher be elected by 
the same board. 
The argument, still persisted in, that the Workman law has reduced salaries is 
again answered and confuted by statistics. While the commissioner writes that in 
some localities demagogues use for selfish ends their single power bestowed under 
the law, he contends that such things may exist under any laws, and that they 
certainly did exist under the old law, and that the remedy is to be found neither in 
enactments nor repeals of laws as much as in enhanced development of educational 
sentiment among the people. It is already felt in the greater stability and uni- 
formity in the requirements made by the colleges upon the public schools, which   
-P-A-G-E-222

serve to overcrowd them more and more with studies that do not properly belong to 
them. Many of the small towns and villages have one high school and one teacher 
to do its work. Such as this can not fail of being ineffective, and the commission 
recommends that either their four years’ course should be diminished or additional 
force assigned to the work. College authorities are those who can do most for 
remedy of such a state of things. 
The effects of the law of compulsory education have been of great benefit to many 
hundreds of children of both sexes. 
Very high praise is bestowed upon the Boys’ Industrial School (correctional, though 
not penal, as well as educational) which it is evident has been managed with much 
judiciousness. Great good has been done during the forty years of its existence. 
This would have been far greater but for the insufficiency of appropriations. The 
following from the last report of the board of trustees is interesting; indeed, 
somewhat touching: 
“We should like our schools as nearly uniform as possible with the public schools 
of the State, in order that pupils sent here for truancy might be continued in their 
regular classes, or that boys released from this school may enter the public schools 
in their regular classes. To do this properly would require the expenditure of 
money for the erection of a union school building and a large increase in the pay 
roll to enable us to employ experienced teachers. With a full knowledge of the 
State’s financial condition, we can not hope to secure the necessary appropriations 
this year, but in order that a start may be made in the right direction, we have 
asked that our appropriation for salaries be increased, so that a good superintendent 
of schools and other necessary officers be employed, with the view of making the 
best use of our present opportunities.” 
In default of legislative action upon the subject the State board of examiners 
drew up a plan for a course in pedagogy, history of education, and science of edu- 
cation for the purpose of improving the quality of teachers, which, in its main 
features, has been adopted by a large number of the colleges, normal schools, and 
universities, and a course of pedagogy has been determined upon for the Ohio State 
University by its board of trustees. 
Ohio has no State system of normal schools; yet in a very large number of cities 
and towns training of teachers forms a part of the higher schools’ curricula. 
Much henefit has resulted from the new text-books law, which, it is claimed, is as 
near perfect as could be made. 
What appears to bethe greatest need to education isan enhanced sentiment among 
the people at large in its favor. This would lead to more rapid improvement of 
teachers. Good teachers would be encouraged and be multiplied but for so much 
apparent indifference regarding discrimination between them and those far their 
inferior. Then such enhancement would lead to greater concern in the matter of 
school buildings, many of which, even in cities and towns, are without adequate 
accommodations, while in many of the subdistricts they are lamentably deficient in 
heating, lighting, ventilation, and other matters important to be well regulated. 
1896. 
The report for 1896 is also by Hon. Oscar T. Corson. 
Attention is called to several amendments in the school law made by the last session 
of the legislature. First, that in addition to the branches in which teachers were 
required to be examined for certificates, history of the United States, including civil 
government, shall be included. It is not meant to require teaching of civil govern- 
ment in the common schools, except in connection with the history of the United 
States. A special committee, after bestowing much study upon the subject, submitted 
a report containing an ‘outline of civics.” ‘This carefully elaborated paper is copied 
into the commissioner’s report. Another enactment requires all boards of education 
in the Stateto have displayed the national flag upon all schoolhouses under their con- 
trol during all day sessions in fair weather, and on the inside on all days. This 
law, while regarded by some as needlessly expensive, has generally been accepted 
with cordiality. 
Another change is the “eight-year certificate” allowed to be granted to appli- 
cants who, in addition to required qualifications, have held a certificate of five years, 
and been for three years next preceding their application engaged in teaching, with 
eighteen months’ experience in one place, and undergone examination in botany, | 
algebra, national philosophy, and English literature. 
The Boxwell law has been so amended as to authorize each board of county exam- 
iners to determine the time and place of holding the examination and county com- 
mencement. This change will make still more effective this excellent law which is 
doing so much to encourage the proper organization of the country schools. In 
counties where the schools close early in the year, the examinations can be held at 
an earlier date, while those counties which are so fortunate as to have nine or ten 
months of school can be accommodated with examinations held at a later date.

| “T+ will be an advantage to have the selection of the place for holding the county 
commencement left to the county examiners. In some counties the county seat 
is not a suitable place to hold the commencement, and under the law as it now exists 
such a place can be selected as will accommodate the greatest number of persons 
interested, and at the same time bring about the best results in educating public 
sentiment for good schools.” 
The following summary of statistics shows the work accomplished by the law 
since it went into effect in 1892:

  Attention is again drawn to the bad management of funds by school boards. “In 
some instances the plainest provisions of the law have been violated, while in others 
contracts involving the expenditure of money have been entered into without any 
authority whatever.” One of the results of such criminally loose management must 
be either reductions in the salaries of teachers or shortening of school terms. 
Tho last legislature passed an act intended to prevent the evils here complained of. 
The county school problem becomes more and more important and difficult of solu- 
tion. In districts sparsely populated many schools have been disbanded and children 
carried from their homes to the leading center school at the expense of the State. 
Thus far this plan has proved quite practicable. Regarding one school of this sort 
particularly, that at Kingsville, in the county of Ashtabula, the report says: ‘‘The 
expense of schooling the children has thus been reduced nearly one-half, the daily 
attendance has been very largely increased, and the quality of the work greatly 
improved.”   
  PENNSYLVANIA. 
Report for 1896, Hon. Nathan C. Schaeffer, State superintendent. 
Quite an elaborate report is that for the year 1896, in which, besides usual official 
returns, are discussions upon several matters appertaining to education and its vari- 
ous accidents. The superintendent speaks with pride of the continual munificent 
appropriations made by the State, that for last year being $5,500,000. 
Under the head of “‘Compulsory education” the superintendent shows that very 
much good has been done by legislation for the relief of children from the injurious 
influences of too early and too burdensome work done in factories and mines. It 
was not until the year 1870 that under the census was ascertained the number thus 
employedin manufactures, This was 114,628, including both sexes, representing 5.58 
per cent of allemployees. This per cent decreased until 1890, wher it became 2.57, 
the decrease being due mainly to legislative enactments. 
The superintendent represents the occasional apparent clash of the law requiring 
compulsory attendance with that requiring production of certificates of vaccination. 
There are cases where parents are opposed to vaccination and others where physi- 
cians decide that (in particular instances) it is not only not necessary but liable to 
hurtful effects upon general health. Upon the child this conflict necessarily operates 
harmfully, whether in failing to secure him against an evil disease or obstructing 
his education. Directors of schools are sometimes embarrassed by the question, Shall 
they prosecute for nonattendance in cases where the law itself forbids attendance? 
Another question arises, Shall vaccination be made compulsory? On the whole, 
while the consensus of the most thoughtful opinion is in favor of the efficacy of it, 
et it is also against having recourse to it when heads of families for any reason with- 
old their consent. 
Some very apt observations are made upon the importance of cultivating taste, 
not only in the construction and decoration of schoolhouses, but in beautifying the 
‘ounds. 
pautder the head of ‘Extravagance” the superintendent says much that is both 
thoughtful and piquant. It has been found that the immense sums appropriated by 
the legislature for school purposes, like those in other business enterprises, indi- 
vidual and corporate, have not only to be economized, but jealously watched and 
guarded. Quite instructing are the following words: 
“No sooner was our general school appropriation raised to five millions than the 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
  1352 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. - 
sharks began to scent prey from afar, First came the agent with charts for teach- 
ing physiology, which were sold at high figures, so as to permit, when necessary, the 
payment of large commissions to subagents and liberal fees to directors’ sons for 
delivering the same in schoolhouses in the districts. Sometimes careless directors 
were enveigled into signing contracts which made them individually liable for the 
purchase if they failed to ratify the sale at the next meeting of the board or to lift 
the charge at the express office. Next came the block man, selling lumber at fancy 
prices in the shape of geometrical forms, which the skillful teacher constructs out 
of paper in so far as she needs them in the elementary school. Finally came the 
map man, selling relief maps at $100 a set. The consequences were soon visible. 
When school boards in rural districts invest from $30 to $100 per schoolhouse for 
maps and other apparatus, it means lower wages, inferior teachers, stinting of text- 
books and school supplies, and sometimes shortening of the school term.” 
The superintendent notes with approbation the increased attention given to the 
study of civil government, particularly that of the State. Careful training of 
pupils in the art of governing themselves has served to expel the rod from most 
of the schools. A unique government, perhaps the only one of its kind in the whole 
country or elsewhere, is that in aschool attached to the University of Pennsylvania, 
named Houston Hall, after its founder, H. H. Houston. 
“Its purposes, briefly stated, are to provide for the students of the various 
departments a place where all may meet on common grounds and to furnish them 
with every available facility for passing their leisure hours in harmless recreation 
and amusement. The entire management has been left in the hands of a student 
organization which elects the officers and committees by which the hall is managed. 
It has a membership of 2,500, and is used by a daily average of over 1,200 students. 
The experiment has, beyond question, met the most ardent expectations of its most 
sanguine friends, and bids fair to solve some of the vexed questions of university 
discipline.” 
ALLEGHENY SCHOOL REPORT. 
Report for 1895, John Morrow, superintendent. 
Enrollment of day school was 14,793, an increase of 708 over the last year. 
‘The report of the superintendent expresses entire satisfaction as to the progress of 
work in the day schools, but far otherwise regarding night schools, which are 
deteriorating instead of advancing. Upon this subject his views are expressed with 
unusual plainness. He says: $ 
“At best their continuance from year to year under existing regulations has been a 
question of doubtful propriety. There ought to be mu¢h more encouraging returns 
than we now get for the expenditure of money and effort put upon them. I think Iam 
not far from the truth when I say that abont 30 per cent of those who attend night 
school go with the avowed intention of trying to break it up, and they always meet 
with considerable success, because they discourage and drive out those who go with 
ood intentions. After the decent portion of school has been banished they then 
rop out themselves. I have always been of the opinion that six schools, centrally 
located, under proper regulations, would do more good than the fifteen or more 
scattered all over the city as heretofore. They could be far better graded, with 
fewer pupils to a teacher, thus insuring more individual instruction. The mob ele- 
ment could be more easily kept out, all at a greatly reduced expenditure. ... 
Already this term it has been necessary in several of the wards to call on the police 
to suppress the disorderly conduct of half-grown boys disturbing the night schools. 
It would not be a difficult thing to formulate rules that would bring these turbulent 
spirits to time.” 
The rgport praises the continual rapid advance of the high school. Answering 
the charge among some that this is only a rich man’s school, the occupations of the - 
pupils’ parents are given to disprove it. 
PHILADELPHIA SCHOOL REPORT, 
The report for the year 1896 is to the board of public education by Simon 
Graty, its president, and is accompanied by others from heads of the several depart- 
ments. 
The report indulges in hearty congratulations on the great improvements in the 
work of the system that has taken place-within a very few years. The measures 
referred to adopted within that time: 
The establishment of manual training schools; the introduction of sewing as a 
regular study in the schools for girls; the establishment of kindergartens; the 
adoption of supervising principalships; the establishment of the school of indus- 
trial arts; the establishment of schools in which pupils of the girls’ grammar 
schools are taught cookery; the establishment of a new normal school for girls, 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
  PENNSYLVANIA. 1353, 
and of a separate high school for girls, the latter having distinct general, classical, 
and commercial courses of study; the adoption of a higher endecal of qualifica- 
tion for teachers in the public kindergartens. 
The report recommends that hereafter applicants for teachers must have had at 
least a high-school] education or its equivalent. Already a large majority of the 
young women teachers have gone through both high aud the normal school. This is 
claimed to be far better than the system of public examinations. The standard in 
the girls’ high school has been raised by an addition of another year to the course. 
Yet many of these higher institutions, notably the Central High School and the 
Central Manual Training School, are much cramped in buildings and general accom- 
modations which, in the words of the former principal, ‘destroys the unity of 
school life.” A large number of buildings are rented; otherwise very many children 
would be debarred from all education. The report says: 
“How long this deplorable condition is to exist appears very uncertain. The 
councils of our city are fully informed on the subject, and admit the great need of 
the board for a large sum of money, running into millions, either to provide new 
buildings to keep pace with the growth of population or to replace such as are unfit 
for occupancy; but the financial problem stands ever in the way of the realization 
of our hopes. The comparatively small appropriations that councils are able to 
make from time to time for the purchase of ground and the erection of new buildings 
do little beyond making provision for the constant accessions to the ranks of cur 
school population.” 
The report admits that little was done in attempts to enforce the school-compulsion 
act during the year. This was because of inability to obtain satisfactory data. 
These, it is hoped, will be gotten through the division lately appointed for that pur- 
pose. Yet the already existing lack of adequate school accommodations, the liberty 
of parents to elect the schools for the children, and the difficulties growing out of 
the fact that there is no compulsory vaccination law, must tend to make compliance 
to a degree inefficient. Complaint is made that the number of scholarships owned 
by the city in the University of Pennsylvania is much too small, and reasons are 
given for the need of increase. es small annual appropriation would suffice for this 
evident pressing need. 
The report speaks earnestly in ‘Wehalf of means for the maintenance of superan- 
nuated and other teachers worn in the service. Legal and financial conditions being 
thus far in the way of public help, a Teachers’ Annuity and Aid Association has 
been formed, which would be a great blessing except for the paucity of its members. 
Tt is suggested that the sectional boards hereafter require every new elect teacher to 
join the association. 
Quite a number of reports are submitted by principals. Particularly noteworthy 
is that concerning the night schools, of which there are 79, with an enrollment of 
25,549, ranging from childhood beyond middle age. Of these 75 per cent are native 
born, and 35 per cent foreign, an increase of 2 per cent among the latter over those 
of last year. 
The whole number of pupils in all the grades is 138,545. 
  PITTSBURG SCHOOL REPORT. 
Report for 1896, George J. Lucky, superintendent. 
The school system of Pittsburg is peculiar. The 38 subschool districts have each 
its own board of directors, which elects a member of the central board of education. 
This latter, in the language of the report— 
“Is authorized to do certain specific things, viz, adopt and furnish text-books; 
build and maintain a high school and anormal school; fix salaries and apportion 
teachers to the several districts; make a course of study; determine the amount of 
money to be appropriated for the high and normal schools and for teachers’ salaries; 
elect teachers for the high and normal schools and teachers of special subjects for 
the district schools.” 
Regarding the powers of the district boards, which the report claims to be an 
illustration of the doctrine of State rights, it says: 
“All other powers are reserved and exercised by the subdistrict boards, viz, the 
locating, erecting, and furnishing of school buildings; the election and dismissal of 
teachers; the election of janitors; the levying of taxes in subdistricts for subordi- 
nate purposes, such as building, repairing, fuel, interest on subdistrict debts, pay- 
ment of debts, etc. “The district boards have power to borrow money under certain 
restrictions. . . . The power and patronage being thus divided, positions on either 
of the boards are not generally sought by those whose only object is to profit by 
holding office; hence cases of malfeasance in office are not numerous. On the other 
hand, schools differ more widely in efficiency than they do in other cities.” 
The report admits that under the system uniformity is impossible. Inequality of 
enrollment in some districts is striking, ranging from 50 to over 2,000. It is charged 
   
-P-A-G-E-226
  1354 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
that this is owing to the fact that subdistrict and ward boundaries coincide, the 
latter of which are made for purely political purposes. 
Besides the supervision of the thirty-eight principals and the principal of tho high 
school, the central board of education assigns a teacher to each subdistrict for forty 
pupils each of average attendance, one-fourth of this number being classed as gram- 
mar teachers. 
There are nine kindergarten schools, which, with some assistance of the board of 
education, are managed and maintained by a company known as the Kindergarten 
Association. 
The board supports three school kitchens, and furnishes Sloyd schools to such 
subdistricts as ask for them. 
School age is from 6 to 21 years, the courses of study occupying seven and a half 
ears. 
Z The central board furnish free text-books, while maps, charts, etc., are supplied 
by the subdistrict boards. 
In many of the schools corporal punishment is prohibited and gradually falling into 
disuse in the others. The report avows the opinion that it ought to cease entirely. 
The feeling is growing that too long time is spent in the primary and_grammar 
schools, that much of arithmetic, grammar, geography, and history might be put 
out. The report suggests that the subject of modifying the course be referred to a 
committee of the best known educators to report a plan. 
The tables show that there are 41,497 pupils, taught by 838 teachers, in 72 
buildings. 
RHODE ISLAND. 
18°96. 
One good result from the business exigencies of the year has been increased attend- 
ance, owing to the want of other occupation of many within school age. Very 
marked changes have been wanting, beyond the fact that the city, town, and village 
schools have been growing, while those in the rural localities have become smaller 
and poorer. Notwithstanding the increasing favor of the town over the district 
system, many of the rural communities persist in adhering to the old, and are thus 
not only kept from improvement, but fallen into continual decay. Says the report: 
“These two features, better teachers and a systematic and progressive course of 
study, can only be had and maintained by means of organization which confers 
definite powers with corresponding liabilities.” 
The slow progress in industrial education makes more marked the necessity of the 
town system, and more clearly defined control of the State over the qualification 
and appointment of teachers. 
The evening schools, now numbering 62, are reported to be doing not as well as 
they ought. One difficulty is the allowing entrance to children who are too young. 
These come in freely at the opening, but soon dropping out begins and comparatively 
few remain. The development of the evening high school, however, has been quite 
satisfactory, particularly in the cities of Providence and Pawtucket. 
Appeal is made for better facilities both in ascertaining the number of feeble- 
minded children in the State and providing for the education possible to them. 
Some of these have been provided for at Waverly and Baldwinville, Mass., and 
Elwyn, Pa. 5 
Some increase has been in enrollment in the College of Agriculture and Mechanic 
Arts, but itis yet too small. It is suggested that this be increased by the State’s 
creating a number of scholarships. 
Praise is bestowed upon the growing utility of the State Home and School for 
Homeless and Abandoned Children, and appeal is made for greater facilities for 
their visitation and inspection. 
In the report of the commissioner it is shown that graded schools have continued 
to develop and ungraded to decline. 
Of the 82 new teachors added during the year 69 were women. Two high schools 
have been added, the number now being i8, containing 5 per cent of the total 
enrollment.   
SOUTH CAROLINA. 
Report for 1895, W. D. Mayfield, State superintendent. 
Complaint is made that the State and county authorities find it difficult to get 
accurate information concerning the special school districts. This lack of informa- 
tion makes it appear, what is not a fact, that enrollment of pupils has fallen off. 
So it is regarding accurate estimate of the average of length in school sessions. On 
this head the report uses this language: 
“Under the rule for ascertaining the average time the schools of a county have 
been in session during the year, the long-term schools, which are in the cities, and
-P-A-G-E-227
  SOUTH CAROLINA. 1355 
towns, and special districts, are placed with the short-termed country schools, and 
the general average for the county does not do justice to the long-term schools, while 
it indicates to the casual thinker that the short-term schools ran longer than they 
really did. It would be well for those schools te be reported in separate classes, and 
the law should be so amended for this purpose. The special schools should be put 
under the school authorities at least to the extent of accounting for the public money 
received and expended, and reporting such ether matters as will enable the school 
authorities to make complete reports of the condition of the schools of the State.” 
The report speaks heartily of general improvement in the teaching force. Summer 
schools and teachers’ institutes, both white and colored, were held in several 
counties in the State, with gratifying results. 
It is contended that the moneys appropriated for public education are not suffi- 
cient. School sessions are necessarily made shorter than they ought to be. Thoso 
in cities, towns, and special districts levying a special tax are of reasonable length. 
In these the general school fund is supplemented by an extra tax of from 2 to 5 
mills, a burden which a majority of the school districts could not endure. It is sug- 
‘ested in view of this want to increase the levy on the property of the counties. It 
is recommended that “the county levy for school purposes be raised from 2 mills as 
a minimum to 3 mills as a maximum, and all male persons between 21 and 60 years of 
age who are able to perform ordinary manual labor be declared taxable polls. This 
fund shall remain a county school fund.” 
  1s96. 
The report for 1896 is from the same superintendent, W. D, Mayfield, and rendered 
to the governor. It announces general satisfactory improvement in the condition 
of education. Gratifying increase in enrollment, greater than during any previous 
year, is shown by the tables. With whites it has been 5,430; with colored, 3,886. 
This was unexpected, particularly for the fact that the scholastic year was only 
eight months, caused by the change in reekoning from July to June instead of the 
former period, from November to October. The change is cordially commended by 
the report, as it makes the collegiate and graded schools coterminal with the sche- 
lastic year, thus presenting divisions of their sessions. Although the average ses- 
sion was less than that of the previous year (being 3.95 months for white and 3.25 
for colored) this is accounted for by the change aforementioned. 
Much pains have been taken to put all the expenditures of the schools on a cash 
basis. The effort has been partially suceessful. In some eounties conditions are 
such that it has thus far seemed impracticable to employ any fixed compulsory law 
in the premises. It is suggested that some amendment of the school law be made 
giving wider discretion to school officials. The counties on a cash basis used only 
the tax formerly levied, namely,.a poll tax and a 2-mill tax. In some of the counties 
not on such a basis it was the same, and nowhere was the 3-mill tax used. 
The report quotes in full the educational sections in the State constitution of 
1895, and complains of the varying constructions to which it is liable, particularly 
the provisions regarding the State dispensary. Adopting the prevailing interpreta- 
tion, which gives to the general expense account of the State the net profits upon 
liquors until those profits reach the sum of $193,816.57, it will not be until June, 
1898, when anything will be realized by the schools from this source. 
A goodly number of schoolhouses: were erected during the year for white and 
colored. 
Feeling has been roused in some minds by the character of some of the scheol 
histories; but this regards private and graded schools over which the superintendent 
has no control. The State board of 1895 adopted its own series, action outside of 
which in the schools under their control is without authority of law. 
It augurs well for the general educational spirit among the people that in a large 
number of public schools the State funds for their support are supplemented by 
subscriptions of private individuals. This is the case with nearly all in some coun- 
ties. Of academies and high schools in operation there were 85. Attendance at 
these and the State colleges, male and female, was. excellent. 
Denominational and other colleges not under State control complain of the free 
tuition in the others. Dependent toa great extent. upon tuition fees, it seems to 
them unjust that a discrimination should be mado which hurts if it does not 
endanger their security. It is recommended that a uniform law upon the subject 
be enacted, without intrenching upon special scholarships already created for nor- 
mal and other purposes. 
    ERSKINE COLLE 
  (Quarter-centennial of Dr. Grier’s presidency.) 
This year (1897) marked the quarter-centennial of William Moffatt Grier as the 
resident of Erskine College, an event of which advantage was taken to signify to 
(im the high regard in which he is held in that State, both as a man and as an edu-
-P-A-G-E-228

cator. The event was celebrated at the college commencement on the 15th of June. 
The State superintendent of education and representatives from the various colleges 
and educational institutions of the State were present and bore loving tribute to the 
worth and high character of Dr. Grier, whose life was declared to be a blessing to 
the State. The alumni of the college, present in large numbers, testified to the high 
appreciation and affectionate regard, each business or profession being represented 
by a spokesman who appeared in its behalf, as ‘Erskine and her lawyers,” ‘‘ Erskine 
and her editors,” ‘‘Erskine and her preachers.” Homage was also rendered by the 
faculty and student body of the college. 
SOUTH DAKOTA. 
Report for 1895 and 1896, Hon. Frank Crane, superintendent. 
The report opens with a historical sketch of the educational system of the State 
since its foundation in 1864. It claims that gradation in the rural schools has served 
to bring into service a large number of trained teachers. Following are some of the 
observations under this head: = 
“The graded country school is in itself a detective agency that ferrets out and 
exposes the incompetent or indolent teacher. The teachers’ reports inaugurated by 
this very excellent system compels the. teacher to make a complete exhibit of his 
work and display it to patrons and superior officers.” 
Further on it said: ‘Our system needs revision. . . . Much of the labor, therefore, 
has been the voluntary patriotic efforts of educators who have received no compen- 
sation other than pride in the success attending their efforts. The work of grading 
our rural schools to the high schools and the high schools to the State University is 
yet to be done.” 
The report declares that the work in the State department needs a much larger 
force for its effective performance. 
The law providing for text-books omitted to make provision for continuing the 
board of education with whom was the authority to adopt and purchase. That law, 
therefore, became inoperative in July, 1896. The books adopted five years back 
are still used in most of the counties. The report says on the subject of uniformity 
in this item: 
“County uniformity of text-books has been tried and proved satisfactory in South 
Dakota and many other States, while township and State uniformity has been 
abandoned in many States because the former unit was too small and. the latter unit 
was too large.” 
The superintendent has no supervision over the normal department, although 
close and friendly relations obtain. 
At the State University the course in philosophy has been discontinued, the 
remaining academic courses required through the sophomore year, and art and violin 
departments added. ‘The plan alluded to in the foregoing report of accrediting cer- 
tain schools has not proven as sutisfactory as was expected; yet within two years 
those of Arlington and Vermilion have been added to the list, Uniformity in fitting 
students is hindered by the frequent changes in the teaching force of the lower insti- 
tutions. The president says: ~ 
“The conditions are further complicated by the necessity of adopting high-school 
courses for the majority who will not go to college, with the omission of some sub- 
jects required for entrance to college, to make room for others in a very elementary 
form which are properly college studies.” 
Reports of county superintendents are given in due order. These are in general 
of a cheerful kind and interesting. Physiology is taught in many. The following 
is from Hamlin County: 
“The subject of physiology is being successfully taught, and the evil effects of 
tobacco and alcohol are so instilled in the young minds that nearly every pupil is 
ready to give a temperance lecture at a moment’s warning.” 
Here follow reports of the city schools. 
The report contains a number of original articles by the superintendent, some of 
considerable length, and showing much study and reflection on various subjects, 
as changes occurring in educational practice, kindergartens, literature in the 
grades, nature study in the common schools, brains in teaching, and relative value 
of common-school studies.    
TEXAS. 
Report for 1895 and 1896, Hon. James M. Carlisle, State superintendent. 
After an extended discussion of the system and importance of public schools in 
eneral, the report pays a very high compliment to Governor Culberson for his 
inflnence in the disembarrassing of conditions into which the system in the State had 
been cast by the confused nature and management of the school revenues, A falling

off in receipts of interest on school-land notes and school-land leases wrought a deficit 
* which increased from year to year, until in 1895 a reduction in the per capita of 
school population occurred notwithstanding which that deficit at the end of the year 
was made $600,000. In this emergency the governor earnestly urged the raising of the 
school tax to 20 cents, the constitutional maximum. A bill to that effect passed the 
house almost unanimously, but, meeting with some opposition in the senate, by a 
compromise the tax was fixed at 18 cents. This being inadequate, further relief 
was granted at the session next ensuing. 
Pressing as is the question of financial supplies—as much so as is that of their 
disbursements—the condition of these in the State is told with much plainness: 
“The State raises the greater part of the school funds, but no provision has been 
made by which any State authority is empowered to take necessary steps to prevent 
the funds from being diverted from their legitimate use. The funds are simply sent 
out to county and city school treasurers to be expended by county and district and 
city authorities, and the State reserves no right tc see that the $3,000,000 of school 
funds raised by the State for school purposes are devoted to school purposes.” 
Here follows an account of the clumsy way in which reports are made and the 
circuits through which they are passed along the line of 225 organized counties and 
the 200 independent city and town districts. 
“There is no subject,” it is said, “of greater perplexity at the present moment 
than the simple inquiry, For what purposes may school funds be legally expended?” 
After giving summaries of school expenditures during the period of 1891-92 and 
that of 1895-96, the report says: 
“ From the summaries it may be seen that the expenditures for all purposes other 
than teaching and supervision, excluding, however, amounts transferred, was for 
1895-96 $166,175.58 less than for 1891-92, while the expenditures for teaching were 
$314,345.47 greater.” 
The reportspeaks of the glaring disregard of the commands of the constitution requir- 
ing six months of schooling, when county schools get a little over four, while city ~ 
schools getnine, and it calls for a law forbidding county trustees and superintendents 
from employing any teacher for less than six and providing that the State school fund 
be entirely relieved of payment of salaries to trustees and superintendents. In existing 
conditions very many heads of families are actually forced from the country into the 
towns for the sake of obtaining what can not be had at their homes—the educational 
advantages to which they are entitled—a misfertune and a wrong which earnestly 
elaim consideration and redress. 
Regret is expressed for the necessary suspension of the department of pedagogy 
in the State University and that this institution, so full of excellent promise, should 
haye to depend upon appropriations at each biennial session of the legislature for 
its support. The report appeals also for other normal schools for supplementing the 
incalculably great good now being done by Sam Houston Institute; also for enlarge- 
ment and increase of endowment for the Prairie View Normal, which has proved 
such a blessing to the colored race. The question of free text-books is again urgently 
advocated. 
  UTAH. 
Report for 1894 and 1895, Hon. John R. Park, superintendent of public instruction. 
Attention is called to the general good and constantly improving condition of the 
schools, particularly in the cities, claiming that they compare favorably with those 
in any of the older States, notably in Salt Lake City and Ogden. Those in rural 
districts also would rank with the majority elsewhere. Just attention has been given 
to school buildings that have been constructed after improved methods regarding 
ventilation, health, comfort, and taste. Even several of the poorer counties, such 
as Tooele, Sevier, Juab, and others, in these respects and in the grading of schools 
have done notably well. 
Further legislation is needed in order to prescribe a course of study for the whole 
educational system. 
Improvement is shown particularly in the increased percentage of attendance 
and diminution of that of truancy. 
The report recommends the creation of a board of examiners for the State, whose 
examinations for teachers shall be uniform, superintendents without exception to 
adopt their examination questions. After successfully passing such examinations; 
teachers having had five years’ experience should be allowed to receive from 
the board of examiners life certificates. It is further recommended that the law 
regarding certificates of normal graduates should be so changed as to relieve the 
latter from subjection to further examination, and that the law authorizing coanty 
superintendents to issue warrants to the county treasurer be made more definite on 
account of the disregard in some instances paid to them. 
While recommendation is made for the creation of a general fund for all school 
* purposes, the report abstains from advocating increase of taxes which, if properly

handled, would: be sufficient. Several suggestions on this head are offered and 
reasons given for their adoption. Among these is one requiring in exhibits rendered 
by this office separate items regarding statistics of “Mormon” and ‘‘non-Mormon.” 
The superintendent says: 
“I suggest that blank forms used for the purpose of obtaining information 
regarding: schools:and educational factors be so changed as: to remove the above- 
quoted obnoxious: words.” 
At the period beginning July 1, 1894, the number of non-Mormon: children was 
7,589; of Mormon, %, 338. Of alk ‘Gliese, 46,495. attended the public schools, 2,224 
private, and 6,188 no schools-of any sort. 
Extended tables:are appended, giving detailed statements of all: items pertaining 
to the school system in its operations in the several counties. 
According te this report, education in: the State, taking into consideration the 
peculiarly embarrassing condition in which society was found upon its admission 
into the Union, and tho prudent, delicate care with which these required to be 
managed in order to: conform to conditions elsewhere, has: advanced with notable 
rapidity. 
1s96, 
The first annual report, being. that for the year ending June 30, 1896, is from the 
same superintendent, Hon. John R. Park. 
Quite an extended discussion is made upon the subject of the law regarding the 
school fund, taxes for whose support are threefold: “A State tax, which is levied at 
a uniform rate upon all the taxable property in the State; a county tax, similarly 
levied upon the taxable property of the county, and a district tax, levied upon the 
taxable property in each district.” 
The report contends that the law is not sufficiently explicit regarding State and. 
county funds; consequently there has been. much confusion, in. some instances pro- 
ducing direst violations of law and inflicting injury upon the districts. where they 
have occurred in one and another item of educational interests. Under this obscure 
system afew of the counties. receive from State and county funds more money than 
. they paid to teachers, yet such misappropriation is not always ascertainable, because 
. some districts pay mainly from the fund raised by local taxation, while others levy 
no such tax, or one inadequate for school needs.. If the State and county fund were 
used legitimately and. with uniformity, all the schools in the State, the aoe 
contends, could be maintained for ten months, paying our average salary of § 
Much is said also on the subject of the law regarding supervision, which it is cous 
tended is alike indefinite, both in the State superintendent and those of counties, 
who have little of control that has much of certitude. Trustees also, in many cases, 
knowing little of the law, which they have never taken pains to study, pay high 
salaries to incompetent and low salaries-to competent teachers, and expend money in 
the purchase of apparatus and other things needlessly expensive. To avoid this in 
part the report recommends that all the districts of a county be consolidated into 
one board and be composed of persons competent in culture and experience to regu- 
late all matters appertaining tothe system. This substitution of county for district 
organization is argued at considerable length and with much earnestness. 
The following is s taken from the pages devoted to the teaching force in the State: 
“Of 1,047 teachers employed in the public schools of twenty-four counties and 
four cities during the school year 1895-96, 300 are normal-school graduates, 38 are 
graduates of colleges, 145 are graduates of high schools, and 564 have not been grad- 
uated from any school giving instruction higher than that offered in the grades. 
The average monthly salary paid to teachers in the public schools, outside of 
cities of the first and second class, is $44.78, and the average number of months the 
teacher is employed during the year is less than six—that is, the average yearly 
income is $224. These figures speak for themselves. It must be evident that such a 
pittance is not enough to induce men and women of superior ability to remain in 
the profession of teaching... . Yet it often happens that there are more applicants 
than there are-places, and often the successful candidate is not selected on account 
of his fitness, but because he is a resident of the district, town, or county in which 
he is employed. In many places the most intense feeling exists against employing 
foreigners, as those who come from a distance, even in the States, are styled. In 
view of these things and the frequent incapacity of trustees to make proper selec- 
tions, it is recommended to abolish all the small districts and place all the schools 
of each county under the supervision of one board of education. 
The Normal School is a part of the State University and has a large number of 
students, for whom there is constant, urgent demand as teachers. Connected with 
the university there is also a course of normal instruction in the collegiate classes. 
While the kindergarten is mucl. desired, the report considers that for the present 
it would not be advisable to make legislative provision for them as for common 
schools, as, however important in towns of as many as 10,000 inhabitants, they are 
not needed in rural districts, where already the burden of maintaining even com- . 
mon schools presses heavily.

VERMONT. 1359 
VERMONT. 
Report for 1895 and 1896, Hon. Mason §. Stone, State superintendent. 
The report notes a great awakening of the people to school interests within the 
last few years. In 1894 the law of free text-books came into being, and aloag with 
them ‘free academic advantages to pupils resident in towns in which secondary 
schools are situated, recognition of college and secondary school grad 
exempting such from examination for teachers’ certificates under certain conditions; 
State aid to summer schools for teachers.” Only one more enactment seems to be 
needed, namely, “close expert supervision of the common schools.” 
Decrease in property valuation, a result of that in rural population, made burden- 
some school taxation, for the relief of which a5 per cent tax law was enacted, the 
revenue of which was apportioned to the various towns to the number of legal 
schools maintained. It is claimed that in no other State can be found more prudent 
and benignant legislation toward maintaining the rural schools. The town system 
has become a fact, and is believed to secure comparative equality. The report says: 
“What the town system has done in Vermont in the solution of the rural school 
problem through the equalization of school advantages may be inferred in part by 
the discussion of transportation, small schools, schoolhouses, repairs, supplies, teach- 
ers, and free text-books.” , 
The question of transportation is not yet in satisfactory solution on account of 
hesitancy in some communities in adopting it. It is suggested that the law, in that 
case, should be made mandatory. 
Some diminution in the number of small schools has taken place, not as great.as 
it should. have been. Itis contended that the State can. better afford transportation 
in rural districts than allow such schools.to be maintained. The three things that 
contribute to keep them small are such. that increase is hardly probable. ‘These are 
“the concentrating tendency of the people, diminution in the size of the New Eng- 
Jand family, and the completion of the common-scheol course at an earlier age than 
formerly.” 
The free text-book law has come into almost universal favor.. Change in text-books 
every tive years, a custom which has obtained during the last twenty-five years, has” 
been followed by far Iess than the expense formerly incurred by it. Competition 
among publishers has enabled officials. to. purchase at. satisfactory prices, and to 
obtain books as satisfactorily gotten up. 
It is admitted that there is great need of a larger number of trained teachers, but 
this need is constantly diminishing. The report says: 
“Teaching to-day is.in a transition period, and is seeking asound basis through a 
larger and better conception of educational principles. The change exhibits itself 
in. the improyed methods which have been. readily accepted and applied.” 
It is noteworthy that the number of teachers. who remain longer than one term of 
school continues to show much increase. 
An earnest appeal is made for a law creating expert schoolsupervision. This, it is 
claimed, is the only thing needed. to render the educational system all that its most 
thoughtful friends wish it to be. 
Further arguments are adduced from eminent sources in other States. Tho system 
was tried as far back as 1888, but. was soon afterwards repealed. It did not meet 
with popular favor, partly because of partial failure on account of extent of terri- 
tory and partly because the expense was considered too great for the amount of 
benefit accomplished. Yet it is contended that this benefit was far greater than was 
generally believed, and the restoration of the law, which the present. system would 
render entirely practicable, is earnestly recommended. The subject is discussed at 
considerable length and in forcible terms. 
In the average wages of teachers it is claimed that the State compares favorably 
with the others in New England. The manufacturing States, Massachusetts, Rhodo 
Island, and Connecticut, are considerably higher, owing to greater expense in living 
and density of population. Wages of women have increased, while those of men 
have remained about the same. On this head the report says: 
“This is due not to a change in the school administration of the State, nor to the 
superior system of examination established, but rather to the multitude of oceupa- 
tions open to women to-day offering greater compensation with less responsibility 
and unkind criticism. They have become the competitors of men in many of the 
trades and professions.” 
The State makes advance in the means of preparing teachers better for the several 
branches of school work; but it is urged that this could be made much greater by 
additional legislative action. At present are the teachers’ meetings, reading 
circles, secondary schools, normal schools, institutes, and summer schools. Teach- 
ers’ mectings in some communities where the superintendents are thoroughly compe-

tent, do well, in others not. About four hundred teachers attended reading circles 
in 1895. In the matter of secondary schools, several of the high schools and acade- 
mies availed themselves of opportunities extended by the law of 1895, whereby 
raduates of approved secondary schools who had received as many as thirty weeks’ 
instruction in teaching may receive certificate of teaching without examination. 
Very much good has come forth in the operation of this law. 
Reports are made of the three normal schools, at Castleton, Randolph, and John- 
son. We quote from the extended observations made concerning them the 
following: 
“As nearly 90 per cent of the schools of Vermont are ungraded schools, the true 
function of the normal school is to train and equip teachers for the country 
ungraded schools. But the normal schools fail in the attainment of the object for 
which they were established unless they send out graduates better equipped than 
the graduates of the secondary schools. The chief aim should be to teach teachers 
how to teach rather than to teach subject matter to teachers—the one makes them 
professional schools, the other makes them common schools. The normal schools 
can never reach their highest degree of influence, power, and popularity until the 
State assumes absolute cor trol and support. The schools can not well exist unless 
there be adequate State aid; and if the State furnishes the revenue of support, then 
ought it to have unrestricted management of the schools.” - 
WASHINGTON. 
Report for 1993 and 1894, Hon. C. W. Bean, superintendent of public instruction. 
The report consists in great part of recommendations of changes in the school 
law, and of elaborate, thoughtful argumentation in their behalf. Among these is 
one for dispensing with the board of county examiners having less than 30 school 
districts and that the work done by them be assigned to county superintendents. 
Others are regarding teachers’ examinations for certificates, record books for school 
districts, the empowering school district boards to employ teachers for terms of two 
years, and devoting a portion of the school fund to the purchase of free text-books, 
for reference and general school libraries, for a specified minimum per capita of 
school fund, for arrangement of courses of study in all schools from the primary to 
the university, etc. 
The State University is represented to be advancing with great rapidity. The 
legislature two years back removed charges for tuition, since when enrollment has 
risen from 140 to 468. The Agricultural College and School of Science also is doing 
well. The General Government endowed the former with 90,000 acres of land, and 
the latter with 100,000, the value of which, although less than half has been 
selected and approved, is rated at over a million dollars. 
‘The report regards normal schools as the most important item in the whole educa- 
tional machinery, and the question is argued at much length, and appeal made for 
the speedy creation of at least three of such institutions, and the abolishment of the 
normal appendage to the university, where, it is contended, it has no rightful 
place. The school at Vancouver for defective youth is in good hands and doing 
much of the good that was expected from it. The records show that there are not 
far below 200 in the State, about 100 of whom are in this institution. It is recom- 
mended, for several reasons given, that it be entirely separate from that for the deaf 
and blind. Good account isrendered of the State Reform School under the direction 
of Professor Westerndorf. 
The three sources from which school revenues are derived are the permanent State 
school fund, taxes levied by county commissioners, and those special, levied by 
boards of school districts. The apportionment of these funds is a subject of fre- 
quent discussions among the people generally. These are given in the report, which 
contends that it should be based upon average daily attendance, which in that case 
would be greatly increased. 
1895-96. 
The report for 1895 and 1896 is from the same superintendent, C. W. Bean, esq. 
The number of school children in average daily attendance increased about 5,000, 
number of schoolhouses being now over 1,800, though there has been some decrease 
in the value of school property. 
Among the recommendations and changes in the school law are to make the dis- 
trict the unit for taxation, to make a prescribed minimum rate in district taxation, 
to levy a tax to reduce district inequalities, to require every district by local taxation 
to provide its own school buildings, and purchase its own text-books out of the list 
chosen by the board of education, who contend with publishers about uniform 
prices; requiring higher educational qualifications in superintendents, abolish

county examining boards in counties with less than thirty teachers, and prohibit 
creation of new districts containing less than some specified number of pupils. 
There has been some increase in average school duration and a slight decrease in 
teachers’ wages. Upon the whole, during the last two years as much retrenchment 
was made as was possible in avoiding infliction of too great injury, although the 
report considers the reduction of teachers as a misfortune. 
it is claimed that the State University is being brought in touch with the various 
preparatory schools. To the State Agricultural College have been added a school of 
pharmacy, one of dairying, and one of farming. Extremely popular is the winter 
course for farmers and fruit growers, when lectures are attended by more than 200. 
The two normal schools at ENensburg and Cheney are earnestly recommended for 
more liberal support by the State. 
As far as practicable, a course of study for ungraded schools has obtained. 
An extended, earnest argument in favor of free text-books is made by the super- 
intendent, citing many States that have adopted it and found ita great benefit; 
another yet more elaborate on the many various means that have been devised for 
the raising of school revenues. The subject is admitted to have many difficulties in 
its striving toward accurate, satisfactory solution. 
      
WEST VIRGINIA. 
Report for 1895 and 1896, Hon. Virgil A. Lewis, State superintendent. 
It is claimed that in providing for free schools the greater portion of the State’s 
revenue is devoted to thisend. After a minute tabulation of statistics of the two 
years, showing increases and decreases in the various items, attention is called to 
what are termed “units of school administration,” of which there are two “minor,” 
that is, ‘two units of school government, and upon the administration in these 
depends almost entirely the success of the State’s educational work.” The first is 
the ‘‘magisterial district.” Says the report: 
“Tn it the administration of all school law is in the hands of a board of educa- 
tion elected by the people, and a board of trustees in each subdistrict, appointed 
by the board of education. Tho powers and duties of each are defined by the gen- 
eral school law of the State. These magisterial districts owe their existence to the 
provisions of the general State luw. By the provisions of section 1 of Article VII 
of the first constitution it was deelared ‘every county shall be divided into not less 
than three nor more than ten townships, laid off compactly as practicable with ref-    
    erence to natural boundaries.’ In compliance with this constitutional provision 
the 1 lature passed an act on the 31st day of July, 1863, containing a schedule in 
which were named prominent men in each county whose duty it was made to divide 
the several counties as required by the constitution. By an act of the legislature 
December 10, 1863, these townships were declared to be school districts,” etc. 
This provision was incorporated into the present constitution founded in 1872. 
The superintendent urges that the schools under this provision be made graded by 
the board of education. 
The second unit is named ‘‘The independent school district ;” these, not being 
under the provision of general law, are under those of special statutes, and are con- 
trolled by a board of education, who act also as trustees. The superintendent 
insists that in each of these independent school districts should be established a 
high or graded school with a complete course of study, and claim that when these 
recommendations are adopted the foundation of the State’s educational work will 
be complete. 
This is followed by an extended account of State certificates and the State board 
of education, a circular of information for school officials, publishers of schoolbooks 
and their prices, and general reports of free schools with various programmes of 
daily exercises. 
Attention is called to the resolutions of the West Virginia Educational Associa- 
tion in favor of a ‘uniform course of instruction for the first two years of all high 
schools throughout the State subject to extension by the several boards of educa- 
tion.” The preamble reads thus: 
“Whereas there is need of unifying the educational forces of the State so as to 
bring about harmony between the courses of study of the common schools, the 
graded schools, the high schools, the normal schools, and admission to the academic 
courses of the university: Therefore, resolved,” ete., and hope is expressed that the 
legislature will pass a bill in pursuance of these ideas. 
Cordial acknowledgments are rendered for the aid received from the Peabody 
fund, which was expended in compliance with the terms of bestowment, which were 
limited to the training of teachers; that is, to the normal schools and teachers’ 
institutes.

  1362 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
WISCONSIN. 
Report for 1895 and 1896, Hon. J. Q. Emery, Stato superintendent. 
The considerable increase in the amount paid to teachers is claimed to indicate | 
better instructors and longer terms of schools. On the whole, this superintendent 
insists that these havo improved every way within the last ten or fifteen years in 
teaching force, in building, and other items in the system. Very few are without 
teachers who have had advantages above district ungraded schools. Very great 
good has resulted from the increase of teachers’ institutes. Improvement is claimed 
also for ungraded schools, because of the advanced sentiments in general growing 
out of such institutes and other associations, and more intelligent, vigilant super- 
vision of county superintendents, leading to better-systemized instruction. 
The following is a summary of the superintendent’s observations on this head: 
“To summarize, these are a few lines along which we may mark the progress which 
is being made, viz: The attendance of pupils, the interest of patrons and citizens in 
the material equipment of public schcols, demand for more thoroughly trained 
teachers, the increase of a more intelligent use of a course of study, and the growing 
appreciation of the value of good books for general reading as an adjunct of the 
school in promoting general intelligence and good citizenship.” 
The report has some very interesting observations regarding urban and country 
schools. The former, although with well-trained and experienced teachers, are 
trammeled partly by the too early leaving school on the part of considerable num- 
bers, and partly by the greater indulgences allowed to children in villages than in 
rural districts. Yet the superiority of these schools works injury to the rural by the 
frequent drafts upon their classes, and greatly diminishing tho number of their 
pupils. The report makes several recommendations tending to better the condition 
of things in these country schools. One is the consolidation of small and sparsely 
populated school districts and the transportation of pupils to and from the school- 
houses when they live too far to walk the distance; another is to provide for better 
inspection; another is a different method in distributing school funds, with view of 
bringing about as great equalization of cost as possible. The report also opposes 
the district as the only or the principal unit of taxation because of its smallness, 
variableness, and liability to be controlled by narrow, selfish considerations. It 
recommends also greater encouragement of kindergartens. 
Other changes are commended, What now is particularly needed is that teachers 
make themselves familiar with the books in the library, so as to help pupils in 
making selections. . 
Much praise is bestowed upon the marked advance of the free high schools, of 
which there are now 197, as many as 8 being added within the last two years. Most 
of these are in towns and villag Towns, as such, have thus far taken little 
advantage of the law. 
The following is taken from observations under the head, ‘ Manual-training 
departments :” 
“By chapter 358, laws of 1895, the legislature authorized any board of education 
in the State having charge of a high school to establish and maintain a department 
of manual training in connection with the schools under its control and management, 
and further enacted that the expense of maintaining such department be provided 
for in the same manner as expenses for maintaining high schools are provided for.” 
The superintendent is to advise and assist in the organization, and the work has 
mado substantial progress. 
‘The State has been liberal in care of the deaf, with whom both the sign and oral 
mothods are employed. At the beginning of the year 1895 there were four of these 
schools. At the time when this report was made there were nine. 
A long space is devoted to physical training in normal schools. It includes 
photographs of pupils at various stages of development, and is in all respects highly 
interesting. The seventh of these normal schools was established in 1895. 
The State University continues to make great strides, Students have gone from 
443 in 1885-86 to 1,598 in 1895-96. The largest number is in the College of Letters | 
and Science, which includes also the schools of economics, political science, and his- 
tory. In this (the College of Letters and Science) there has been a great increase of 
women students, greater, indeed, than that of men, The proportion of the former to_ 
the latter in 1886-87 was 116 to 221; in 1896-97 it was 327 to 491. 
The following extract showssome facts that are highly interesting and significant: 
“Tt can not be said that the problem of coeducation presents many difficulties. 
The old query as to whether the health of young women would bear the strain ofa 
university course has been swept away by the energetic hand of experience; so, also, 
has the doubt as to whether scholarship would not suffer from the presence of 
women in the classes. It is settled, not only hero but elsewhere, that the general 
health of young women is better the time of graduation than at the time of 
entrance, and that the average scholarship of young women is higher than that of 
young men.” . 
    
          
    
-P-A-G-E-235
  WISCONSIN-—-WYOMING. 1863 
Thero are somo difficulties, however, the report admits, one being the “tendency 
to excessive recreation.” It is suggested that an official be appointed to be styled . 
“dean of the woman’s department.” At present the university has no control over 
the deportment of the large majority, who live in clubs and boarding houses. Yet 
the superintendent says, ‘‘It is a pleasure to add that in general none is needed.”     
     
WYOMING. 
Report for 1605 and 1896, Miss Estelle Reel, superintendent of public instruction. 
Complaint is made of the lack of sufficient facilities for obtaining correct and 
reliable statements of school statistics, subordinate officials being slow and often 
inexpert in rendering accounts to county superintendents. The difficulty lies partly 
in objections to the provisions which district treasurers and clerks are required to 
observe, which to some of them seem needlessly exacting and onerous. The law 
requires these officials to report to the voters of the district at the annual district 
meeting on tho first Monday in May, and afterwards on the first Monday of Sep- 
tember to report to the county superintendent. This added burden is much com- 
plained of, and delay and laxity are the consequences. 
Yet increments aro reported in several lines. The number of schools in 1894, 379, 
increased to 425 in 1896, of teachers from 407 to 465, and of pupils 1,272. Attendance 
of children is better than ever before. School buildings have gone from 257 to 306. 
But the average of wages has decreased; also the cost of tuition to some extent. 
Under operation of the act of 1895 for reduction in the number of school districts, 
they have been brought down to 1 Notwithstanding reduction in the salaries of 
county superintendents, high praise is bestowed upon their diligence and efficiency. 
‘The report argues strongly for the adoption of a uniform course of study for the 
oie State. Ié has already been adopted in several of the counties with signal 
enefit. 
Much praise is bestowed upon the county institutes. The good results from regu- 
lar reading of educational magazines and like publications lead the superintendent 
to urge every teacher in the State to subscribe for them. 
The superintendent is earnest, like her predecessor, in the matter of free text-books, 
and commends the following arguments made by the latter in one of his reports. 
After carefully studying the question, noting the experiences in other States where 
the system prevails, the following summary of benefits is given: 
“First. A gain of from 25 to 40 per cent on first cost. 
“Second. A gain of at least 33 per cent in the time the book will be in proper 
condition to use. 
“Third. Considering first cost and time of use, there isa gain of about 50 per 
cent in cost to the community. 
“Fourth. The classes are uniformly supplied at the proper time and with the 
proper text-books. 
“Fifth. The very unpleasant distinction between rich and poor is avoided. 
«Sixth. Increased attendance. 
enth. Schools are more successfully graded. 
ghth, A State or county system is more easily carried ont. 
“Ninth. A very great and unnecessary expense to teachers is avoided ” 
Inasmuch as adoption of the system in general will be, in all probability, delayed 
by consideration of the great expense which the first outlay must necessarily incur, 
the report recommends for the present that the matter be left to the voluntary 
action of the several districts. 
Attention is called to the extremely onerous duties of the State superintendent’s 
department. This official, in addition to being school superintendent, is ex officio a 
member of the board of trustees of the State University, secretary of the State 
board of charities and reform, and secretary and register of the State board of 
land commissioners. Without seriously complaining, the superintendent uses the 
following sufiiciently pertinent language: 
“The law authorizes a contingent which allows the heads of other departments 
to appoint such clerks for their office as they deem advisable, and it is not easy to 
discern the wisdom of the restrictions placed upon the clerical assistance afforded 
to this department.” : 
The university is reported to be advancing. The trustees this year did away with 
what was styled the ‘‘subpreparatory class.” The standard has been considerably 
raised, and some valuable accessions have been made to the faculty. 
Much benefit is claimed to have come already from the State Teachers’ Association, 
which was formed in the year 1891. 
Quite a liberal grant of land was lately made to tho State Agricultural College. 
To guard against the hindrances probably attaching to judicious disposal of land 
in large quantities, it was provided that selections be made of tracts not less than 
160 acres, nor more than 640.

INTRODUCTION. 
The authors of ‘‘ Minerva, Jahrbuch der Universitiiten der Welt,” which is the 
chief source of information offered in the following six lists, say that they have 
submitted their work at various stages of completion to different professors of the 
countries mentioned, so that they are assured that their decision as to which of 
the learned institutions of the world should be regarded as universities is upheld 
by the most trustworthy authority. They call their Jahrbuch a collection of 
names of teaching bodies, of universities, or similar institutions of the world. In 
the first edition the authors admitted that, despite the most rigorous search, a 
few of the smaller institutions of the Western Hemisphere escaped their notice. 
In subsequent editions these omissions have been corrected, and libraries, societies, 
and museums added, so that the fifth edition, that of 1895-96, is a remarkably 
valuable source of information. Since this Report of the Bureau of Education 
contains direct information concerning the higher institutions of learning in the 
United States, they have been omitted from the following lists, which are devoted 
exclusively to foreign institutions.

1380 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
I. InrRopUCTION: SCOPE AND CHARACTER OF THE WORK. 
North Carolina was the first of the Southern States to work out a good system 
of common schools. 
The Rev. A. D, Mayo, in his chapter on the ‘‘ Early common schools in the 
Southern States,” in the Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1895-96 
(p. 282), says: 
“As it was during the half century now under consideration—1790-1840—this 
State did make an educational record, if not in some respects so brilliant as Vir- 
ginia, yet beyond the Old Dominion, more decided at first, more steady in the 
upbuilding of the secondary education, and, at the close, 1835-1840, was able to 
lace on the ground, beyond dispute, the best system of public instruction in the 
Portteon Southern States east of the Mississippi previous to the outbreak of the 
civil war.” 
  The purpose of this paper is to trace the development and growth of this form 
of education in North Carolina; to present a summary of all the efforts made by 
the government to aid the work of primary and secondary schools, ranging in 
character from a mere act of incorporation to an actual grant from the school 
fund. In a word, to present, so far as the meager materials at command will 
allow, a history of the schools devoted to primary and secondary education whose 
existence has been brought about by the State. This scheme will leave out of 
view a number of academies in the middle and western counties in colonial and 
Revolutionary times, which represented the sole educational resources of their sec- 
tions. These furnished all the grades of education from the primary school to 
the college and theological seminary, but were purely private institutions. They 
neither asked nor received aid or recognition from the State, and consequently 
can not be brought within range of the present inquiry. On the other hand, some 
schools of this very class were chartered by the State and given special privileges. 
These have been treated. Further, there is less need to consider the purely private 
schools and academies of the eighteenth century for the reason that they and 
their influence and the influence of the Presbyterians and of the College of New 
Jersey, to which their organization is due, were but recently studied in part by 
Dr. Charles Lee Smith in his History of Education in North Carolina (Washing- 
ton, 1888, 8°, pp. 180), and more recently and with more detail by Prof. Charles Lee 
Raper, of Greensboro, N.C., in his work on the Private Schools of North Carolina 
(in the College Message, Greensboro, N. C., September, 1897, to May, 1898). 
The purely private school, with no charter and no recognition from the State, 
was largely an eighteenth century product. As schools increased they found it 
more and more to their interest to secure charters and the privileges which were 
thus conferred. All schools chartered prior to 1825, when the literary board was 
created and the State’s share in education began to be more apparent, have been 
mentioned by name, with date of incorporation. 
The great leader in the development of North Carolina common schools—pri- 
mary and secondary schools organized and supported by the State—was Calvin 
Henderson Wiley (1819-1887), their first and only superintendent before the war. 
Hence this chapter in the history of Southern education has taken, to a certain 
extent, the form of a biography. 
Il. Tue First Errorts ror PopuLtar EpvucaTion, 1695-1728. 
The development along educational lines in North Carolina was very slow and 
was due mainly to the slow growth of population. The reasons for this are to be 
found in the bad government and neglect of the proprietors, who devoted them- 
selves to building up the colony on Ashley River and allowed that of Albemarle 
(from which grew the colony of North Carolina) to get along the best it could; 
to the persistent hostility of the Crown and its agents and of the British merchants
-P-A-G-E-253

to the proprietary government, for the Carolinas were ‘‘private property that the 
British Crown had heedlessly parted with and was constantly seeking to regain 
possession of by purchase, quo warranto or otherwise;” to the difficulty of access 
because of the lack of good harbors, the dangers of the coast, and the consequent 
loss of trade; to the lack of mills and other manufactures, and to the persistent 
hostility and jealousy of Virginia.' On the other hand, the mildness of the climate, 
the fertility of the soil, the abundance of game, the presence of slaves, and the 
comparative peaceableness of the Indians all invited to a country life, while the 
lack of harbors, then as now, caused many products to be sent out of the colony 
to markets with better facilities, and thus took support from the home towns. 
All of these things worked directly against the development of the intellectual 
life. Further, the English idea of the seventeenth century was that the great 
. body of the people were to obey and not to govern, and that the social status of 
unborn generations was already fixed. Hence the need of education was not felt 
by the leaders. Moreover, there were no professional teachers; and had there been, 
there were not enough children within an accessible radius to support a school. 
There were antagonisms of race and religion, and dissensions, caused largely by 
religious differences, weakened the colony. But as early as 1695 we find an effort 
to foster education, In that year, when William Pead, an orphan boy, was bound 
to the governor to serve him until he was 21 years of age, a requirement was made 
by the general court that he be taught toread.? In 1698 we havea similar instance; 
Elizabeth Gardner appeared before the precinct court of Perquimans and bound 
her son William to the governor, he or his heirs, ‘‘Ingagen to Learn him to Reed.” 
With the eighteenth century there cameimprovement. The established church, 
despite the ecclesiastical evils that followed in its train, was a great help to the 
intellectual life. Its missionaries brought with them the first parish or public 
libraries and its lay readers were the first teachers. Perhaps ‘the first profes- 
sional teacher in North Carolina was Charles Griffin, who came from some part 
of the West Indies about 1705 and settled in Pasquotank County. He was appointed 
reader by the vestry, and opened a school. By his “diligent and devout example” 
he so far improved the people of Pasquotank ‘beyond their neighbors” that Mis- 
sionary Gordon “was surprised to see with what order, decency, and seriousness 
they performed the public worship;” by his ‘‘ discreet behavior” he ‘‘ gained such 
a good character and esteem that the Quakers themselves send their children to 
his school.”* Griffin taught in Pasquotank about three years; but in 1708 Rev. 
James Adams was directed by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel to 
settle in that precinct,’ and the school was transferred to him. Griffin, on the 
recommendation of Gordon, was elected reader and clerk of the vestry of Chowan 
at £20 per annum,’and he, ‘“ notwithstanding the large offers they made him if he 
would continue,” consented to goto Chowan.® He opened school in that precinct, 
and Gordon ‘‘ gave some books for the use of scholars,” 
In 1712 there was a school kept at Sarum, ‘‘on the frontiers of Virginia, between 
the two governments,” by a Mr. Mashburn. Rev. Giles Rainsford wrote that his 
work was highly deserving of encouragement and that he should be allowed a 
salary by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. ‘*‘ What children he has 
under his care can both write and read very distinctly, and gave before me such

surprised me to hear it,”! 
There were also a number of parish libraries in the province during this period, 
sent over by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel for the use of its mis- 
sionaries. The first of these had been sent as early as 1700 at the instance of the 
Rey. Dr, Thomas Bray, who had come out as commissary of the Bishop of London 
in Maryland. It was established at Bath, and was worth £100. The law of 1715 
made for the protection of this library is one of the earliest specimens of library 
legislation within the limits of the present United States.’ 
Other missionaries, Adams, Urmstone, and Rainsford, had libraries, and these 
served, no doubt, as a nucleus around which was gathered the literary and edu- 
eational life of the colony, for we have already seen that these missionaries served 
also as school-teachers. 
A notable effort to encourage popular education was made by Edward Moseley 
in 1723. Ini720 hesent a letter to the secretary of the Society for the Propagation 
of the Gospel, with £10 for buying religious books to be loaned to the parishioners 
of Chowan County. In 1723 he sent to the secretary ‘‘a catalogue of such booksas 
he had purchased, desiring the honorable society would be pleased to accept them 
toward a provincial library for the government of North Carolina, to be kept at 
Edenton.” This catalogue has been preserved. It mentions 26 folio, 12 quarto, 
and 38 octavo volumes. The books were largely theological and scholastic in 
character and mostly in Latin and Greek. They had probably been gathered 
together in America and seem to have come from some of the parish libraries that 
were scattered from time to time. There is, unfortunately, no evidence that the 
library was accepted by the society, or that it was ever opened in Edenton. But 
the size of the library and the value of its books indicate that Moseley was a broad- 
minded and liberal man. 
This is all the information we have regarding schools and libraries under the 
proprietors. This side of colonial life was shamefully neglected by them. They 
eared neither for the spiritual nor the intellectual man. They reckoned the lives 
of the colonists only in quitrents and taxes. With the neglect of education went 
the higher intellectual elements depending upon it.’ 
      Ill, Tur Roya GOVERNMENT AND Epvucation, 1729-1776. 
There was little change in matters of education during the first twenty years of 
royal rule. In his address to the legislature in 1735 Governor Johnston urged the 
establishment of schools. That body made a fair reply, but nothing was done. 
The colony did not at that time have either a printing press or a printed revisal of 
its laws.’ 
In 1745 some progress was made in school legislation. On April 15, Mr. Craven 
brought in a bill ‘to Impower the Commissioners for the town of Edenton to keep 
in repair the Town fence, & to erect and build a Pound Bridges Public Wherf and 
to erect and build a school house in the said Town and other purposes”® This 
bill became a law. As this is the first law on the statute book of North Carolina 
relating to pence: that section may be anges in full:

“VI. And be it further Enacted, by the authority aforesaid, That the Commis- 
sioners of Edenton may receive Donations and Subscriptions, towards defraying 
the Expenses of building the School-house in the said Town and apply the same 
accordingly; and may, in their Names, or in the Names of the Commissioners for 
the time being, commence Suits or Actions for the Recovery of any Sums given 
or subscribed to be paid, for the Purpose aforesaid by any Person or Persons who- 
soever, 
It will be noticed that this act is merely permissive. Donations are leisurely 
made and more leisurely collected, even when threatened with the law as in this 
case. There is no evidence, and no probability, that this schoolhouse ever got 
further than the statute book. * 
In 1749 a bill ‘‘ for an act for founding, erecting, governing, ordering, and visiting 
a free school at — for the inhabitants of this province,” was reported to the 
assembly, but it failed to pass. 
The question was again agitated in 1752, and a bill was introduced ‘‘for the 
better establishing the church, for erecting of schools,” etc., but it met the usual 
fate of such matters. * 
In 1754 a liberal proposition came from George Vaughan, a London merchant 
trading to Lisbon, looking to the foundation of a school in North Carolina. 
Vaughan wrote Governor Dobbs that his purpose was to donate ‘‘one thousand 
pounds yearly forever” to the propagation of the Gospel among the Indians in and 
near North Carolina. Of this the governor, council, and assembly were to be 
perpetual trustees. The fund was to begin after the death of John Sampson, the 
nephew of Vaughan. This offer was met by a counter proposition from the 
assembly, that if the gift ‘‘was not confined to the Indians only, but made to 
extend as an academy or seminary for religion and learning to all His Majesty's 
subjects in North Carolina” they would enlarge the donation ‘by a reasonable 
tax on each negro” in the province. 
Deeds were accordingly drawn by Vaughan to that effect, but their execution 
was suspended until the proper law had been enacted by the legisiature.® A law 
making an appropriation for the schools had been made already. This had been 
done in the spring of 1754, and stands as section 12 of an act granting an aid to 
the King.® This act, made, however, subject to approval by the King, appropri- 
ated £6,000, to be issued in bills,’ for the endowment of a public school for the 
province. After the passage of the bill the committee on propositions and griev- 
ances formally resolved: 
“That under a sense oi the many advantages that will arise to the province 
from giving our youth a liberal education (whether considered in a moral, relig- 
ious, or political light) a public school or seminary of learning be erected and 
properly endowed. And that for effecting the same the sum of £6,000 already 
appropriated for that purpose be properly applied.’”® 
But after the school had been legally established it was found necessary to use 
the funds for the French and Indian war,° and when the borrowed fund had been 
returned from taxes it was used again for similar purposes. In 1759 it went to 
support troops in the Cherokee campaign.’ In 1761 it went to pay the judges and

even by title.

for war purposes.! In 1762 it went to garrison Fort Johnston and Fort Granville.’ 
As a result the Vaughan bequest came to naught. 
The question of education was frequently recommended to the attention of the 
legislature by Governor Dobbs during the next ten years. In 1759 and again in 
1764, Dobbs asked the Board of Trade to allow the money originally intended for 
schools to be reissued for that purpose, but the right to issue bills was refused at 
the instance of British merchants.* In 1763 the assembly, through their agent, 
asked that a part of the fund coming to North Carolina as reimbursement for war 
expenses be devoted to education, and this was refused.* 
Discussion of the subject continued, however, and in December, 1762, Rev. 
James Reed, of Newbern, preached before the assembly a sermon, ‘‘ Recommend- 
ing the establishing public schools for the education of youth.” This serrmon was 
printed at the public expense, and this was, perhaps, the first actual appropriation 
for education.> In 1763 Rey. Alexander Stewart reports a manual-labor school, 
established by the society of Dr. Bray’s associates, for Indians and negroes in Hyde 
County.® 
The one successful school of the period seems to have come from private initia- 
tive. In December, 1763, Thomas Tomlinson, an English teacher who had had a 
school in Cumberland, arrived in Newbern, ‘‘ well recommended with regard to his 
abilities, sobriety and good conduct.” He opened aschool January 1, 1764; got 
all the pupils he could teach and sent home for an assistant.’’ A subscription was 
started for a schoolhouse and Rey. James Reed writesin June that he had secured. 
notes for that purpose for more than £200 (£110 sterling). ‘‘ During my eleven 
years’ residence in this province I have not found any man so well qualified for 
the care of a school as Mr. Tomlinson. He is not only a good scholar but a man of 
good conduct, has given great satisfaction to the parents of such children as are 
under his care and will be of infiniteservice to the rising generation.”* The building 
of the schoolhouse proposed by Reed was authorized by an act passed at the February- 
March session, 1764,° and in the following May the leading citizens of Newbern 
addressed a letter to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, through Goy- 
ernor Tryon, in which they asked that Tomlinson be given a regular salary as a 
representative of the society, pleading, besides his good qualities, ‘‘ that there has 
never been in their province any regular settled schoolmaster.” The petition was 
indorsed by Tryon, who says that Tomlinson was ‘‘the only person of repute of 
that profession in the country,” '! and met a favorable response, for the society 
granted him “an additional salary,” amount unknown.” In July, 1765, Mr. Reed 
writes that the building of the schoolhouse went on but slowly for the lack 
of funds. Tomlinson was expecting an assistant daily and then had 30 pupils 
at 20s., proclamation, by the quarter, which amounted to £60 sterling per year." 
The schoolhouse was still unfinished in 1766, when the matter was taken up by 
an act ‘for establishing a schoolhouse in the town of Newbern.” The act, after 
reciting that ‘‘a number of well-disposed persons, taking into consideration the 
great necessity of having a proper school or public seminary of learning estab-

lished, whereby the rising generation may be brought up and instructed in the 
principles of the Christian religion and fitted for the several offices and purposes of 
life, have at great expense erected and built in the town of Newbern a convenient 
house for the purpose aforesaid; and being desirous that the same may be estab- 
lished by law on a permanent footing, so as to answer the good purposes by the 
said persons intended,” enacted that the contributors to the schoolhouse fund 
should choose out of their own number eleven persons to be trustees, who were by 
this act chartered as the Incor: porated Society for Promoting and Establishing the 
Public School in Newbern, and given the powers usual to such bodies. No person 
was to be admitted master of the school who was not of the Church of England 
and licensed by the governor. The trustees were to take the oaths to the Govern- 
ment, subscribe the test, and then take a special oath ‘‘to execute and discharge 
the several powers and authorities” conferred by the act. Elaborate previsions 
were made for the control and direction of the trustees, and as the contributors 
were ‘desirous that the benefits arising from said school may be as extensive as 
possible, and that the poor who may be unable to educate their children there 
may enjoy the benefits thereof,” a duty of 1 penny per gallon was to be levied on 
all rum and other spirituous liquors imported into Neuse River for seven years. 
This was to be used in educating ten poor children. The master was to havea 
salary of £20 per year ‘‘ toward enabling him to keep an assistant.”! 
This law has been given in detail, because it is practically the first law passed in 
the province for the encouragement of public education. 
A further effort was made to aid the school by the legislature of 1768, which 
passed an act ‘‘for declaring certain lots in the town of Newbern, taken up by 
the trustees for promoting the public school in the said town, saved and improved. 
according to law; and to empower the said trustees to collect the subscriptions 
due to the said school.” This act was repealed by the King in council in 1770, on 
the ground that the act set aside the statute of limitations.’ 
But it appears that those interested in the school were not at all disposed to let 
the English Government thwart them by repealing this legislation on the school, 
for in 1778 the legislature passed a supplementary act in which it was provided 
that the four lots contiguous to the lot on which the school society had erected “a 
large and convenient building for the use and accommodation of the master and 
scholars of said school” should be deemed as saved and improved lots, according 
to the terms of the act in force. 
In 1767 and 1768 efforts were made to establish by legislative authority a similar 
school in Edenton. These bills failed because the assembly refused to require 
that the teachers should be members of the Church of England, in accord with the 
instructions to the governor and the terms of the schism act.® 
The opponents of the church schools idea yielded finally, however, and the Eden- 
ton Academy was chartered in 1770-71, under an act ‘‘ for vesting the schoolhouse 
in Edenton in trustees.” The terms of its charter and the objects of the school 
were in all essentials like those for the Newbern Academy. The trustees had 
power to receive voluntary subscriptions, and ‘‘no person shall be admitted to be 
master of the said school but who is of the Established Church of England.”® 
As we have aay seen, the master and teachers of the public school in New-

pern were also required to be of the Church of England, in accordance with the 
provisions of the schism act, which was enforced in North Carolina from 1780 to 
1778, so far as the Government was able.!_ Under this act no one, under penalty of 
three months’ imprisonment, could keep either a public or a private school, nor 
could act as tutor or usher, unless he had obtained a license from the Bishop of 
London, had engaged to conform to the Anglican liturgy, and had received the 
sacrament in some Anglican church within the year. To prevent occasional con- 
formity it was provided that a teacher so qualified who attended any other form 
of worship was to suffer the full term of imprisonment and to be forever incapaci- 
tated from acting as tutor or schoolmaster. This requirement handicapped the 
dissenters by throttling their schools, and consequently did great harm to learn- 
ing. The power of the Established Church was felt mainly in the eastern half of 
the colony. The result was that there were few private schools at the time of the 
Revolution. 
IV. Private INCORPORATED ACADEMIES, 1760-1825. 
The western part of the Province of North Carolina—the western half of the 
present State—was occupied, speaking very broadly, by races differing from those 
of the eastern counties. The latter were-settled mostly by immigrants from the 
old country and from Virginia who moved farther to the south in search of better 
lands. These immigrants were mostly of English extraction, and this was the 
general character of the population until the end of the proprietary government 
in 1728. 
About 1786 the Scotch and Scotch-Irish immigrations began. One stream came 
in by way of Charleston, 8. C., another by way of Cape Fear River, while a third 
came southward from Pennsylvania. These streams met and commingled in the 
Piedmont region of the present State. They clung more closely together than 
earlier settlers had done, and “almost invariably as soonas a neighborhood was 
settled preparations were made for the preaching of the gospel by a regular stated 
pastor, and wherever a pastor was located, in that congregation there was aclassical 
school, as in Sugar Creek, Poplar Tent, Center, Bethany, Buffalo, Thyatira, Grove, 
Wilmington, and the churches occupied by Pattillo in Granville and Orange.” 
Another class of settlers who contributed no little to the intellectual advance- 
ment of middle and western North Carolina were the Germans, who came over- 
land from Pennsylvania, and in religion were divided into Moravian, Lutheran, 
and Reformed bodies, but there was harmony between these parts, and in matters 
of education they were one. In this migration, which began as early as 1745, the 
Moravians were among the leaders. They appeared in 1753. The ensuing south- 
ward movement lasted for a generation, and in 1785 there were 15,000 Pennsyl- 
vania Germans in North Carolin: These immigrants were careful to set up 
churches and schools on arrival, and if there were no teachers among them they 
sent to Germany for such. A number of these schools were taught in the Ger- 
man language. It is safe to say that during the second half of the eighteenth 
century no class of the population of North Carolina was more intelligent than 
this German element.+* 
Still another class which added no little to the strength of the province in 
morals and otherwise were the Quakers. They began coming to central North 
Carolina, principally from Pennsylvania, as early as 1743, and kept it up until 
the close of the Revolution, but in educational matters they do not occupy as 
high a place as the German churches or the Presbyterians.*

COMMON SCHOOLS OF NORTH CAROLINA. 1387 
As early as 1744 the Presbyterian synods of New York and Pennsylvania began 
sending missionaries to North Carolina. The earliest of these missionaries was 
Rey. John Thompson, who came out trom Virginia in 1744 and labored in the 
Iredell section of the State until his death in 1753. The next missionary was Rey. 
Hugh McAden, a graduate of Princeton in 1753, who came to North Carolina in 
1755 and became one of the principal founders of the Presbyterian Church in the 
South. 
Samuel Davies Alexander, in his Princeton College during the Highteenth Cen- 
tury, has gathered the names of the Princeton men who cast their lot in North 
Carolina. This list has been summarized and commented on by Dr. Smith in his 
istory of Education in North Carolina. It included, among others, Alexander 
Martin, class of 1756, afterwards governor; Rev. Alexander McWhorter, class of 
1757; Samuel Spencer, class of 1759, a native of North Carolina and a superior 
court judge; Joseph Alexander, class of 1760, teacher; Rev. David Caldwell, class 
of 1761, teacher; Waightstill Avery, lawyer, and Rev. Hezekiah James Balch, 
class of 1766; Isaac Alexander, president of Liberty Hall Academy, and Samuel 
Eusebius McCorkle, teacher and preacher, 1772; John Ewing Calhoun, lawyer and 
United States Senator from South Carolina, 1774; Rev. Thomas B. Craighead, 
1775, a native of North Carolina and an educational leader in Tennessee; Spruce 
McCoy, member of Congress and superior court judge, 1775; Nathaniel Alexander 
and William Richardson Davie, both members of the class of 1776, and both gov- 
ernors of the State; David Stone, governor and United States Senator, 1788; 
Thomas Pitt Irving, teacher, and Robert H. Chapman, second president of the 
University of North Carolina, 1789; Joseph Caldwell, first president of the Univer- 
sity of North Carolina, 1791; Charles W. Harris, an early professor in the University 
of North Carolina, 1792; William Gaston, member of Congress and justice of the 
supreme court, 1796, and Frederick Nash, chief justice of North Carolina, 1799. 
Some of these were natives who went to Princeton for their training, but a 
majority of them came from other States and cast their fortunes among the 
people of North Carolina. It is to them that the State is largely indebted for 
her first classical academies, the clause in her constitution providing for the uni- 
versity and the common schools, and the organization and development of the 
university for the first two generations of its life. 
The Rey. James Tate, a Presbyterian minister from Ireland, organized Tate’s 
Academy, in Wilmington, about 1760. Crowfield Academy, in Mecklenburg 
County, was organized about the same time, and from this, in connection with 
Poplar Tent Academy, organized in Cabarrus County about 1778 by Rev. Robert 
Archibald (Princeton, i772), came the germ of the modern Davidson College. 
The academy of Rev. David Caldwell, located about 3 miles from Greensboro, 
was organized about 1767, and for many years ‘‘served for North Carolina as an 
academy, a college, and a theological seminary.” The average attendance was 
fifty to sixty, and was large for the time and country. It was not interrupted by 
the Revolutionary war until the British army appeared in this section in 1781. 
The greater part of his students had already joined the American Army; his prop- 
erty was plundered by the British; his library and all his literary accumulations 
burned; he was himself treated with indignity, and had to spend many nights in 
the woods to escape capture. The school was revived as soon as circumstances 
would ailow, and Dr. Caldwell continued in active service until about 1822, when 
age and infirmities compelled him to retire. He died in 1824, aged 99. His appa- 
ratus and materials for teaching seem to have been very limited, especially after 
the invasion of the British in 1781, and the course of study does not seem to have 
been an extended one, but of its thoroughness the success of many of his pupils 
gives ample testimony.!

  1388 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Clio’s Nursery and the Academy of the Sciences was another of these private 
Presbyterian schools which did so much for the intellectual upbuilding of the 
State. It was located on Snow Creek, Iredell County, and was opened about the 
beginning of the Revolutionary war. It was in charge of Rev. James Hall 
(1744-1826), who was graduated from Princeton in 1774 and declined a tutorship 
there to do missionary work in North Carolina, where he became a pastor and 
teacher. ‘In addition to his duties in Clio’s Nursery, he opened at his residence 
an “academy of the sciences,” which was supplied by him with some apparatus 
and of which he was sole professor. This seems to have served as a scientific 
course for the academy, the first of its kind in the State. After the Revolution, 
Hall founded a circulating library within the bounds of his charge, and to advance 
the cause of education organized a Saturday class of young people to take lessons 
in grammar. The great need of the day was text-books, and to remedy the diffi- 
culty he prepared a grammar and had manuscript copies made, which were 
circulated among the class. Later it was printed and was used extensively.! 
But these schools were private institutions, and although representing all that 
there was of educational facilities for their respective sections, did not come within 
the limits of Government charter or aid. They lived in spite of instructions to 
the royal governor, for their very existence was contrary to the principles of the 
schism act. 
Queen’s College, Charlotte, was another.Presbyterian school which attained dis- 
tinction, but had, perhaps, the hardest struggle of all for existence. Its begin- 
nings are traced to the classical school established at Sugar Creek, near Charloite, 
in 1767, by the Rev. Joseph Alexander. It was chartered as Queen’s College in 
1770-71 by the assembly. This charter brought up the question of the schism act. 
This was not the first time that that question had come up, but it had-never before 
been seen as clearly. The promoters of the school had yielded so far as to provide 
that the president of the institution should be of the established church and be 
licensed by the governor, but the fellows, trustees, and tutors would be, for the 
most part, Presbyterians. On this question the Board of Trade, to whom the 
matter was referred in England, write the King that ‘‘ from the prevalency of the 
Presbyterian persuasion within the county of Mecklenburg we may venture to 
conclude that this college . . . will, in effect, operate as a seminary for the edu- 
cation and instruction of youth in the principles of the Presbyterian Church, 
Sensible as we are of the wisdom of that tolerating spirit which generally pre- 
vails throughout your Majesty’s dominions . . . still we think it our duty to sub- 
mit to your Majesty whether it may be advisable for your Majesty to add encour- 
agement to toleration by giving the royal assent to an establishment which in its 
consequences promises with great and permanent advantages to a sect of dis- 
senters from the established church who have already extended themselves over 
that province in very considerable numbers.”? 
The charter of Queen’s Museum was accordingly repealed by proclamation in 
1778; but the institution flourished without a charter and became the rallying 
point of the literary societies and debating clubs that preceded the Revolution, 
The name was changed from Queen’s College to Liberty Hall Academy about 
1775, and on May 9, 1777, the coveted charter was secured from the assembly of 
the newborn State. The trustees were all Presbyterians and the school was under 
the supervision of Orange Presbytery, which at that time covered all the State. 
The course of study in the institution was nearly the same as that pointed out 
afterwards by the trustees of the University of North Carolina. No degrees were 
given, but diplomas and certificates of study instead. Dr. Alexander McWhorter,

who had been sent by Congress to preach up liberty and independence in the 
Southern States, was induced to become its president, but the school was suspended 
about February 15, 1780, and was never resumed. The cause for this suspension 
of activity was due, no doubt, to the war and to the presence of British troops in 
that locality. By an act of the assembly in October, 1784, Liberty Hall Academy 
was said to have fallen ‘‘in an entire state of decay” and was transferred from 
Charlotte to Salisbury and the name changed to Salisbury Academy, but this 
change should be considered as a removal and revival, not as a new institution, 
for seven out of fifteen of the old trustees were included in the new board.’ After 
the closing of Liberty Hall Academy, the Rev. 8. C. Hall maintained for many 
years a classical school of high grade at Sugar Creek, near Charlotte, where young 
men were prepared for college. After the close of the Revolution Dr. Thomas 
Henderson conducted a high school in Charlotte for a number of years. 
Education and the constitution of 1776.—The English institution known as 
Queen’s College, but better known by its American name, Liberty Hall Acad- 
emy, was the connecting link between the old régime and the new, between the 
British system and the system of the new Republic. It was the last to seek a 
charter from the Crown. It was the first to receive it from the independent Com- 
monwealth. In fact, a new impetus was given to education in the constitution 
of 1776. This constitution, adopted by assembled delegates at Halifax, N. C., 
December 18, 1776, says in its forty-first article: 
‘That a school or schools shall be established by the legislature for the conven- 
ient instruction of youth, with such salaries to the masters, paid by the public, 
as may enable them to instruct at low prices; and all useful learning shall be 
duly encouraged and promoted in one or more universities.” 
This clause is a literal copy of the forty-fourth section of the constitution of 
Pennsylvania, which had been adopted on the 28th of the preceding September, 
except that the phrase ‘‘in each county” after the word “established” was left 
out of the North Carolina constitution. These two States, Pennsylvania and North 
Carolina, were the first in the Union to put into their free constitutions a pro- 
vision for the erection of schools. 
Science Hail, Hillsboro, was the next institution to secure incorporation under ~ 
the new constitution. William Hooper, the signer; Governor Alexander Martin; 
Governor Thomas Burke; Thomas Hart, the grandfather of Thomas Hart Benton; 
and Nathaniel Rochester, the founder of Rochester, N, Y., were among the incor- 
porators. {twas given the same privileges as Liberty Hall Academy. This act 
was amended in 1784 when the old Episcopal church was vested in commissioners 
and devoted to general religious uses on Sundays and to the uses of the school 
on week days. The school could confer no degrees, but was allowed to raise 
money by a lottery.2. This is probably the first instance in the history of the free 
State in which the aid of the government to schools extended beyond the mere 
formal granting of charters. 
Granville Hall, in Granville County, seems to have been in more than the usual 
sense a child of the State. It was chartered in 1779, and we find Richard Caswell, 
governor; Abner Nash, speaker of the senate; and Thomas Benbury, speaker of the 
house of commons, as the leading trustees. They were instructed to purchase 500 
acres of land and erect suitable buildings, The act recited that large sums had 
been subscribed for support of the school. After 1780 Rev. Henry Pattillo (1726- 
1801), a Scotchman who had emigrated to America in early manhood and had 
studied privately under Rev. Samuel Davies, became principal of this academy. 
He had already taught in Virginia and in Orange County, N.C., and is said to have

spent some twelve years in teaching. The success of his pupils indicates that 
Pattillo was a faithful teacher, but we have few facts concerning his schools. He 
had been a member of and chaplain to the provincial congress of North Carolina, 
and chairman of its committee of the whole. He wasa man of literary tastes, and, 
although narrow circumstances and a large family were drawbacks in his career, 
was an author of considerable pretensions. ; 
He published in 1796 a geographical catechism.! As this seems to have been 
the first text-book printed by a citizen of the State, and was intended for the 
schools as well as family use, it deserves more than a passing notice. 
Jt was intended ‘‘to assist those who have neither maps nor gazetteers to read 
newspapers, history, or travels.” It contained ‘as much of the science of astron- 
omy and the doctrine of the a dged sufficient for the farmer and for 
the student who either had or did not have an opportunity to pursue these studies 
further. It is dedicated to General Davie, and the ‘‘ fourth inducement for pub- 
lishing,” the author says, was that ‘‘I did, and still do, hope my book may bring 
me in a few dollars, which will be welcome guests when they arrive.” He begins 
with a description of the earth’s surface. From this he turns to the zodiac, 
explains this, and passes on toa general description of the planets. He feels it 
mecessary to argue in favor of the heliocentric theory of the universe, and the 
whole has an intensely religious tone. His account of Uranus is interesting: 
“The seventh and most exterior of all the planets was discovered a few years ago 
by Dr. Herchell [sic], which, in honor of the British King, he called the Georgian 
Planet.” On comets he says: 
     
     
     
    are mere conjecture. Some judge them the seats of punishment 
uffer the extremes of heat and cold, Mr. Whiston says a comet 
           approaching the sun brushed the earth with its tail and caused the deluge, and 
er will cause the conflagratio: 
  rvey of the planets he returns to geography and begins with Europe, 
but most improved quarter of the world.” Of Spain he say 
“Spain claims as much territory in North America as thrice the United States; 
extending from the isthmus of Darien to the polar circle; and from the Pacific 
Ocean on the west to Canada, Mississippi, and the gulph of Florida, on the east. 
* Insuch a vast extent of coast they have many ports and harbors, the chief of 
which are New Orleans, on the Mississippi: Vera Cruz, Campechy, Honduras, St. 
Jago and Porto Bello, on the gulph of Florida; and Aquopuicho and Panama on 
the Pacific. These dominions contain Mexico, New Spain, and many other prov- 
Bee Spain owns in South America from the Carribean Sea to the Straits of 
Magellan.” “the smalle 
       
   
Of Turkey he says it ‘‘is about 1,000 miles in length from Chotzim, near the 
border of Poland, to the southern point of the Morea; and from Oczakow, on 
the Nieper, to Dalmatia on the Adriatic, nearly as wide. This empire contains 
the ancient Peleponesus, now Morea, Achaia, Greece, Macedon, Illyricum, Bul- 
garia, Wallachia, Moldavia, and parts of Tartary. The capital of the whole empire 
is Constantinople.” All of which goes to prove that geography, like history, 
needs to be constantly rewritten. 
When America is reached the author is carried away with his subject. He thus 
describes the beginnings of the Revolution: 
    «Britain backed her claims with a fleet and army, and the devoted town of Boston 
felt the first vengeance of offended royalty. O my dear country! never forget 
your then situation. Without an army; without a general bred in the school of 
war; without great or small arms fit to oppose the unconquered forces of Britain; 
without a treasury; without an ally; without a single frigate to oppose the first 
naval power on earth—a power deemed our mother, among whom we had a million 
of relations, friends, and correspondents—to oppose the King whom we honored 
to idolatry! At this awful period Congress met, under a load of public cares, 
inconceivable by all but patriots. It seized the helm; it became a center of union

and of motion to the scattered colonists, and made a common cause with Boston. 
The continent, as by an electrical shock, caught the noble and enthusiastic spirit, 
of liberty and resentment. Heaven pointed out George Washington as the instru- 
ment by whom it would save his country.” - 
He then reviews the States, and coming to North Carolina, speaks of the infant 
university as follows: 
“A university is established by act of assembly, in Orange County, with liberal 
appointments by the State, and numerous benefactions. It is yet in its infancy; 
has about sixty students, and if under the government of good and learned men, 
must prove an extensive blessing as well as an honor to the State. What can more 
loudly call for the prayers of all good people than that God's blessing may reside 
on our principal seat of learning, from which fountain are to flow those streams 
that must poison or purify our country. Its short progress has been rapid; may 
its success be glorious!” 
Smith Academy.—In 1782 Smith Academy was chartered in Edenton. This 
academy was the gift of Robert Smith, a lawyer and merchant of that town, who 
died in 1782. Among its trustees were Judge Iredell, Governor Samuel Johnston, 
and Dr. Hugh Williamson. Their annual income was not to exceed 3,000 Spanish 
milled dollars per year; they were to “appoint their public visitation of the acad- 
emy once every six months, when they shall examine what progress is made by the 
several students, at which visitations they may, for the encouragement of learn- 
ing, give certificates to any students concerning the progress they have made in 
any species of learning,” but they were not to grant ‘‘ degrees or titles, such as the 
degrees of bachelor or master of arts or doctor in any faculty.”! 
Innes Academy.—In 1783 the legislature chartered Innes Academy in Wilming- 
ton. This school was based on the gift made in 1759 by Col. James Innes, who 
bequeathed his plantation, Point Pleasant, near Wilmington, a considerable per- 
sonal estate, including slaves, all his books, and £100 sterling for the use of a free 
school for the benefit of the youth of North Carolina, The charter provided that 
the rector, professors, and tutors of this academy, and of ‘‘all other academies and 
public schools ” established by law in the State, should be free from military duty 
so long as they held their respective offices. Pupils, also, who entered any of 
these schools at the age of 15 or under were exempt from military duties so long 
as they remained in the schools. Of the history of Innes Academy we know, 
unfortunately, very little. A building was commenced after the incorporation, 
but before it was finished a theatrical company was organized in Wilmington and 
the lower floor was fitted up for use as a theater. This arrangement was consum- 
mated by a perpetual lease to the Thalian Association. In 1803 an act ‘‘for the 
“relief of Innes Academy” recites that most of the old trustees were dead, had 
refused to act, or had removed to distant parts of the country. A new board was 
appointed and was given authority to reorganize. The land bequeathed by Innes 
was then still in the hands of the trustees,” 
Martin Academy.—The Innes Academy represented the extreme east. The 
same legislature, April, 1783, incorporated Martin Academy in what is now Wash- 
ington County, Tenn. This was the first literary institution in the Mississippi 
Valley. John Causon was the president of its board of trustees, and it was 
granted the same powers as Liberty Hall Academy in Charlotte. In 1795 it 
became Washington College. Samuel Doak was its president from its organiza- 
tion in 1783 until 1818. 
Davidson Academy, located at Nashville, was another Tennessee institution 
which received its charter from North Carolina in 1785. Rev. Thomas B. Craig- 
head, Hugh Williamson, Gen. Daniel Smith, Col. William Polk, Anthony Bledsoe, 
and Gen. James Robertson were among the incorporators. The school was

years or more—in the week on intellectual, Sundays on spiritual things. The 
academy received 240 acres of land from North Carolina; from which it realized 
about $20,000. September 11, 1806, the academy was rechartered as Cumberland 
College; it was rechartered November 27, 1826, as the University of Nashville, 
and under the administration of Philip Lindsley had an extended career of use- 
fulness. Then came a period of reverses. Under an act approved March 24, 1875, 
a connection was made with the trustees of the Peabody fund, and through this 
union the Peabody Normal School has absorbed and taken the place of the older 
institution and the academy, intended for the training of youth in Davidson 
County, has grown into a great school for the training of teachers for the whole 
South.! 
The movement thus begun was soon to extend from one end of the State to the 
other. The act which chartered Martin Academy, in Washington County, Tenn., 
also chartered Morgan Academy, in Burke County, N.C. Davidson Academy 
was to serve, as we have seen, for the district of middle Tennessee; Martin Acad- 
emy for eastern Tennessee; Morgan Academy for western North Carolina.” 
There seems to have been a fear that the State was in some way responsible for 
these academies, so it was provided that neither of them should be considered 
‘‘one of those seminaries mentioned in the constitution, to oblige this State to 
support any president, professors, or tutors of either of the said academies, or 
other charge or expense thereof whatsoever.” 
Zion Parnassus was another Presbyterian school which exerted a wide influ- 
ence. It was not chartered and had no connection with the State, But its dis- 
tinct normal department, the first in North Carolina and probably the first in 
America, but of which I have been able to find nothing more than a mere state- 
ment that it existed, and Dr, McCorkle’s connection with the University of North 
Carolina, demand that its work be recognized at least. Rev. Samuel Eusebius 
McCorkle (1746-1811) was a native of Pennsylvania, a graduate of Princeton, and 
a Presbyterian missionary. He established his school at Thyatira, on the road 
between Salisbury and Statesville, in Rowan County, in 1785. In this school 
worthy but needy young men were given tuition and furnished with books. The 
school continued ten or twelve years. The course of study was modeled on Prince- 
ton, and six of the seven students forming the first graduating class of the Univer- 
sity of North Carolina had been prepared there; forty-five of his students became 
ministers. He was offered in 1795, but declined, the professorship of mental and 
moral philosophy in the infant University of North Carolina, This professorship 
would have made him virtually president of the institution. He had a consid- 
erable library and was quite prolific as an author. 
OTHER ACADEMIES, 
Besides the academies already mentioned a many others whose history 
has come down to us in most cases only in the acts of incorporation. The general 
character of these acts is the same. A number of persons, sometimes including 
representative men of the State as well as those o! 
corporate powers and absolute control over the m: 
school, and were usually made codptative. The 
grant certificates, but the right to grant degrees local prominence, were given 
ear ra and direction of the 
chools generally had power to 
was specifically denied. These 
acts also gave power to the trustees to sue for and recover by action of debt or 
otherwise the sums of money which had been su 
which payment had been refused. In some casi

distinction at any time in the future. The trustees usually chose the teachers. 
There was sometimes exemption from taxation. In the earlier charters special 
provision was made that such were not to be considered as any of the academies. 
for which provision had been directed in the constitution. 
Academies chartered in 1785 : 
Dobbs Academy, at Kinston, Dobbs (now Lenoir) County. 
Grove Academy, in Duplin County. This school seems to have been successful. 
“The Greek and Latin languages will be taught, and also the sciences.”? 
Chartered in 1786: 
Franklin Academy, Louisburg, Franklin County. 
Pittsboro Academy, Chatham County; in 1797 it was allowed to raise $700 by 
lottery. * 
Pitt Academy, located at Greenville, which had been recently called Martinboro, 
in Pitt County. Among the incorporators were Governor Caswell, Hugh William- 
son, and William Blount. 
Warrenton Academy, in Warren County; among the trustees were Rev. Henry 
Pattillo, Gen. William R. Davie, Governor Benjamin Hawkins, Nathaniel Macon, 
Gen. Thomas Person, and Willie Jones. By a later act they were authorized to 
raise $3,000 by lottery. Further, a surplus of £250, then in the hands of the com- 
missioners of the town, was directed by the legislature to be paid over to the 
school in accord with the wishes of the town. This seems to have been the first: 
instance in the history of the State of local taxation for schools. In 1795 this 
academy was under the charge of Professor George, a graduate of Trinity College, 
Dublin.

Bladen Academy, Elizabethtown, Bladen County. In 1808 the trustees were 
empowered ‘‘to rent out the fishery on Cape Fear River in the commons of the 
said town” for three years, and the money arising from the same was to be applied. 
to the academy, but this act was repealed in 1809.

empowered to raise $10,000 by lottery. 
Chartered in 1799: 
Fayetteville Seminary, Cumberland County. 
Peasley Academy, ‘‘at or near the dwelling of Rey. William Peasley,” Moore 
County. 
The Williamsboro Franklin Library Society, Granville County. Its object was 
“the improvement of useful knowledge,” and seems to have included a school as 
well as the work of a library proper. 
Chartered in 1800: 
Sneedsboro Academy, Sneedsboro, Anson County, 
Edenton Academy, Edenton, Chowan County. This academy was empowered 
to raise $3,000 by lottery.. Samuel Johnston was the president of its board of trus- 
tees, and the academy hada long and honorable history. Among its teachers who 
acquired wide celebrity in the State was the Rev. Jonathan Otis Freeman. By 
chapter 63, laws of 1807, the commissioners of the town were instructed to convey 
to the academy 6 acres of town property. 
The first act which seems to have had in mind the instruction in regard to public 
schools in the constitution of 1776 was that for ‘‘a public school in the county of 
New Hanover.” This act, passed in 1800, provided for trustees and their govern- 
ment, as the other charters had done, and empowered them to hold property 
received “by gift, grant, subscription, or otherwise.” Beyond this and the fact 
that it is called a ‘‘public school” there is no hint that it was to have public 
support. 
Chartered in 1801: 
Union Meeting House Academy, Duplin County. 
Clio Montana Seminary, in Rockingham County. This seminary had been in 
operation prior to the time of its charter. 
In 180i the trustees of the Newbern Academy, which had been in existence years 
before this time, were empowered to raise $3,000 by lottery ‘‘for the purpose of 
building an academy on the schoolhouse lots in the town of Newbern.” In 1812 
the power of cooptation was taken from the trustees and placed in the town. All 
freemen who were possessed of a freehold or were masters of families had the right 
to vote, and, further, this privilege was conferred on all ‘‘ who within one year 
immediately preceding the said election shall have made a donation to the said 
academy of the value of $5, or within four years immediately preceding of $20.” 
Raleigh Academy, Wake County. The legislature granted to this academy the 
public square in the town, known as ‘Burk square,” for the site of a building. 
They received in the charter no public aid beyond this. Amendments in 1809 gave 
the trustees power to increase their number and a grant of certain quarries for 
five years, inasmuch as ‘‘the quarries of rock in the public land adjacent to the 
city of Raleigh, though of no benefit to the State, might yield a small emolument 
to the trustees of the academy.” 
Chartered in 1802: 
Franklin Academy, in Franklin County. 
Wadesboro Academy, in Anson County. 
Caswell Academy, in Yanceyville, Caswell County.

they had given $25. Any white man who had given $5 was eligible as a trustee. 
In 1819 it was allowed to raise $2,000 by lottery. ‘‘And the trustees of the said 
academy shall be jointly and severally liable in their proper person to fortunate 
adventurers in any lottery authorized by this act for the amount drawn to their 
respective numbers in an action on the case brought to recover the same.” 
Union Hill Academy, Buncombe County. This school was founded on a gift of 
8 acres of land in Buncombe County, given by William Forster, jr., ‘‘for the pur- 
pose of a place of residence for a preacher of the gospel and teacher of an English 
and Latin school,” or either, as the majority of trustees should deem most advis- 
able. In 1809 the trustees were allowed to raise $5,000 by a lottery ‘‘for the pur- 
pose of completing the necessary buildings” and also ‘‘for establishing a female 
academy in the town of Asheville,” under direction of the same board of trustees,

tion since that date, but did not receive a charter from the State until 1866. One of the Moravian 
teachers who attained reputation as a scholar, especially through his knowledge of Hebrew, 
was John Jacob Fries. He came to North Carolina from Denmark in 1754 and taught from time * 
to time until his death in 1793.

present in this act, but beyond this it does not differ from similar acts of incor-

Clio Academy, Iredell County. This academy had been in existence for many 
years. Its founder and organizer was Rev. James Hall. In 1815 the name was 
changed to Statesville Academy. 
At this time the educational movement took a new turn in the incorporation of 
“Thalean associations,” ‘‘for the purpose of aiding an institution of learning, and 
the general promotion of literature.” With such objects, an association by this 
name was organized in Fayetteville in 1814 and another in Wilmington. 
Chartered in 1815: 
A change becomes manifest about 1815, when the terms of incorporation begin 
to vary from the set phrase which had come down from the Revolution, In 1815 
the Fayetteville School Association Company was chartered, with $10,000 capital. 
Commissioners were appointed to open books for subscriptions for shares at $25 
each. As soon as $1,000 had been subscribed, the school was to be put into opera- 
tion. The trustees were to be elected by the stockholders, stock was to be trans- 
ferable, and the association was allowed to hold property up to $20,000. 
Library societies were another phase of educational activity which began about 
this time. ‘‘The Person Library Company” was chartered in 1815; was empow- 
ered to organize a library and hold $2,000 in property. The Raleigh Library 
Company was chartered in 1816, and was allowed to hold property up to £2,000. 
Center Library Society, of Iredell County, was chartered in 1817. The Buffalo 
Library Society, of Iredell, and the Fayetteville Library Company, of Fayette-

western counties in this State are distant from Chapel Hill, which renders it incon-

an excellent board of trustees, was given the power to confer degrees, and was 
exempted from taxation—and there it stopped. But from this germ came a little 
later Davidson College.

There are several features which characterize these acts of incorporation. They 
were chartered on private initiative and were backed by private enterprise. In 
some. cases, like that of the Bingham School, charters were obtained for institu- 
tions that had been long in existence. The terms of the various charters, with the 
mere change of name, are almost identical. The State limited its fostering care to 
allowing the town in which the school was located to present to it the town com- 
mons, or to allowing it to raise a certain sum by lottery, generally taking care to 
make the incorporators personally responsible to the drawers of prizes. It some- 
times exempted the property from taxation.and, in tho earlier period, the pupils 
and teachers from military service. But, with these exceptions, the legislation 
was merely permissive. 
V. THE AGITATION FOR THE CoMMON SCHOOLS, 1815-182. 
We have seen the provision in the constitution of 1776 providing for primary 
education. The University of North Carolina was chartered in 1789; it was opened 
in 1795. There was no further effort made by the State for years to aid any phase 
of education. 
Governor James Turner, in his message to the legislature, November 21, 1804, 
took up the demand for public instruction, saying: 
“Knowledge is one of the firmest pillars of national strength; and believing 
that nothing would tend more to the advancement of the character and respect-

ability of this State than a general diffusion of learning, I am desirous of seeing a 
een of education introduced which shall extend itself into every corner of the 
Governor Nathaniel Alexander, November 19, 1806, indorsed the recommenda- 
tion of Governor Turner and added a ringing demand of his own. 
Governor William Hawkins, in his message to the general assembly, November 
20, 1811, said: 
“Too much attention can not be paid to the all-important subject of education. 
In despotic governments, where the supreme power is in possession of a tyrant or 
divided amongst an hereditary aristocracy (generally corrupt and wicked), the 
ignorance of the people is a security to their rulers; but in a free government, 
where the offices and honor of the State are open to all, the superiority of their 
political privileges should be infused in every citizen from his earliest infancy, so 
as to produce an enthusiastic attachment to their own country, and insure a jeal- 
ous support of their own constitution, laws, and government, to the total exclusion 
of all foreign influence or partiality. A certain degree of education should be 
placed within the reach of every child in the State.” 
On November 22, 1815,Goyv. William Miller, who had been reared in Warren 
County and who was the first student of the University of North Carolina to 
attain the governorship, called the attention of the assembly to the need of public 
schools in his address to that body. He said: 
“To cherish this spirit of inquiry and produce men who shall not only under- 
stand their rights, but have the spirit to assert and maintain them at every hazard, 
nothing is better calculated than an extensive diffusion of information. ... The 
progress which has been made of late in the establishment of seminaries for the 
education of youth evinces a spirit and genius in the people of this State for 
literary acquirements. But so long as these establishments are left to depend 
for support upon individual exertion their beneficial effects must necessarily be 
partial. It is under the fostering hand of legislative patronage alone that the 
temple of science can be thrown open to all.” 
The message was referred to a committee, but no further action was taken. 
Governor Miller was not discouraged. In his message to the legislature on Novem- 
ber 20, 1816, he said: 
“The subject of education has always been one of primary importance with 
all governments established for the benefit of the great body of the people. ... 
If the wealthy alone be admitted to the temple of science, the most dangerous 
species of aristocracy may be apprehended, . . . 
“The various seminaries which have arisen in the State within a few years, 
from individual exertion alone, marks the progress of literary taste and points to 
the present as the time for legislative patronage. Permit the favorable juncture 
to pass and this growing taste may sicken and require ages to revive. To avail 
himself of public sentiment in support of any measure denotes the judicious 
statesman.”! 
This part of the governor’s message was referred to the committee on education. 
It seems that there were two reports from this committee. The first report is 
dated December 17, 1816, and is signed by John M. Walker.? The other was made 
December 19, 1816, and was signed by Archibald D. Murphey, of Orange, as 
chairman. It seems that the report of Walker—the first, as far as known, ever 
made on education in the State of North Carolina—has hitherto escaped attention. 
Itis of interest because of the striking reason advanced for the necessity of educa- 
tion in North Carolina—a reason which the later experience of the State amply 
justified—and-because of the curious method of supplying teachers which is sug-

?The House Journal gives john W. Walker as member of the house of commons from War- 
ren County for that year. There was no other Walker in that legislature. The report is said to 
be from “‘a member of the committee to whom was referred so much of his exceliency’s mes- 
sage,” etc., but there isno mention of this report in the journals of the legislature for that year.

gested. The report is summarized from a unique copy in the library of the pres- 
ent writer (8 vo., pp. 8). z 
Mr. Walker says: 
oY . Inviewing the subject brought thus near us, we have great cause to 
felicitate ourselves that our fellow-citizens are beginning duly to appreciate its 
importance; and that North Carolina may rival any State in the Union in the 
number and respectability of its academies. ... However important educa- 
tion has been to our country, it is becoming increasingly so to the Atlantic States. 
If we cast our eyes from the East around the North to the South, we find vast 
tracts of fertile land springing into Territories, and these growing into States, en- 
joying great advantages in fertility of soil, in salubrity of climate, and above all, 
enjoying the same inestimable blessings of a free government with ourselves. 
“These great advantages are already beginning to dissolve the attachment to 
the spot of nativity and the kindred tie of acquaintance, by inviting thither the 
stream of migration. Let butthe advantage of facility in education be added, and 
the vinculum which binds man to his birthplace and family will no longer restrain 
its current. 
“Such is the demand for education in our country and such the scarceness of 
teachers that the competition between the parents for teachers has raised the price 
of ordinary education to $15 and $20thescholar. The majority of indigent parents, 
having from three to four children capable of receiving education, are unable to 
pay such a price. Your committee therefore propose to lessen the price of tuition 
y increasing the number of teachers. ... They are emboldened to recommend— 
‘First. That three classes of 186 young men, between the ages of 15 and 20 
years, be annually and successively taught and prepared to teach reading, writ- 
ing, arithmetic, English grammar, and moral philosophy at the public expense, 
they first giving bond to the governor of the State for the time being in the prob- 
able amount of the cost of their education, conditioned to teach in some county 
in this State three years, at the moderate price of $5 per scholar, with liberty to 
enter into any other pursuit after receiving their education by cancelling their 
bond, or so much as remains due, in proportion to the time they wish to avoid 
teaching. The first class to commence in 1817, or as soon thereafter as convenient; 
the second class twelve months after the first, and the third class twelve months 
thereafter. ... 
“Third. That the first court of pleas and quarter sessions held in 1817, in each 
county, appoint not less than five nor more than twelve prudent, intelligent men 
in their respective counties, who shall constitute a board of literature to continue 
in office five years, and who shall have power to fill vacancies occasioned by resig- 
nation, death, or removal, and whose duty it shall be to invite and recommend 
indigent young men of their respective counties to enter into the above class. . . . 
“Fifth. That a school for the reception of this class be established in each 
judicial district of this State, apportioning to each school a proportionate number 
of scholars according to the population of each district; and the steward’s depart- 
ments be furnished and supplied out of the public treasury. Supposing it will 
require three years to prepare each class to teach, and by thus establishing the 
schools for their tuition, the cost of the State is not expected to exceed $50 a 
scholar the first year, $40 the second, $30 the third and succeeding years. Upon 
this supposition, the subjoined table will show the amount of cost and the extent 
of operation of this plan.

  1402 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
«Your committee beg leave to make a few remarks on the foregoing table and 
plan of education. First: On the economy of the plan. ... Second: Its facil- 
ity in operation. ... Third: Its diffusable operation. ... Fourth: Its capacity 
for extension. . . .” 
The chairman of the committee, and the author of the report which is summar- 
ized a little farther on, was Archibald D. Murphey. The work of Murphey was 
so important in advancing the interests of the common schools that he won for 
himself the title of ‘‘ father of the common schools.” He deserves more thana 
passing notice, for he was not only the father of the North Carolina common 
schools, but of the first geological work done under governmental auspices in 
America, and was the first native historian of North Carolina. 
Archibald De Bow Murphey was the son of Col. Archibald Murphey, and was 
born in Caswell County, N. C.,in 1777. He was prepared for college in the famous 
academy of Rev. David Caldwell, in Guilford County (see p. 1387) and entered the 
University of North Carolina in 1796. He was graduated with the highest dis- 
tinction in 1799; was immediately chosen professor of ancient languages in that 
institution and served in that capacity for three years, In the meantime he 
studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1802. His skillfulness in the exami- 
nation of witnesses and the argument of causes before juries made him a reputa- 
tion, while his Quaker-like plainness of aspect, his scrupulous cleanliness and 
neatness of attire, his habitual politeness and a subdued simplicity of manner won 
his way to the hearts of juries. His style of address was that of earnest and 
emphatic conversation, and he delighted in equity practice. He was elected a 
judge of the superior court by the legislature in 1818; he served for two years and 
was once given a special commission as judge of the supreme court. He pub- 
lished three volumes of reports, embracing the decision of cases from 1804 to 1819. 
Judge Murphey was a member of the State senate continuously from 1812 to 
1818, and it was in this capacity that his greatest usefulness to his State appears. 
No other man of his generation showed the same broad grasp and philosophic 
insight as to what should be the proper public policy of the State. Governor 
Graham says: 
“ Judging from the public documents which he has left behind him in advocacy 
of this policy, no man has eyer brought into our legislative halls a more ardent 
spirit of patriotism, amore thorough survey and comprehension of her situation and 
wants, or proposed bolder or more intelligent measures for her relief. Whether 
these measures failed from error in their conception or timidity in his contempo- 
raries to meet and boldly sustain them, the historian must pronounce that his 
reports and other writings in regard to them are the noblest monuments of 
philosophic statesmanship to be found in our public archives since the days 
of the Revolution.”    
His scheme for the advancement and upbuilding of the State may be divided 
into three general divisions. The first was to improve her means of transporta- 
tion by deepening the inlets from the ocean, opening the rivers for navigation, 
connecting them by canals and turnpike or macadam roads, and thus concentrat- 
ing her trade at two or three points within her own limits. This concentration 
would build up commercial cities of her own, bring about the economic independ- 
ence of the State from other States, and thus secure a better regulation of her cur- 
rency andexchanges. The second scheme dealt with the education of the masses, 
and will be treated later in detail. 
From 1815 to 1823 Judge Murphey was either chairman of the legislative com- 
mittee or of the board of internal improvements, and as such prepared annual 
reports on the public policy of the State, which were much commended by high 
authority. In 1819 he published a memoir on the internal improvements and 
the resources and finances of the State. Asa result of his labors, Hamilton Ful- 
ton, an English engineer, was invited, by authority of the legislature, to come out 
to North Carolina at a salary of $6,000 in gold. Fulton arrived about the middle
-P-A-G-E-275
  COMMON SCHOOLS OF NORTH CAROLINA. 1403 
of July, 1819. He brought with him Robert H. Brazier, as surveyor, at a salary of 
$1,500, and the two made surveys of harbors and rivers and of many routes for 
roads in various parts of the State. The plan of Judge Murphey, for which he 
obtained the approbation of Fulton, was to improve the inlets at Nags Head (if 
possible), which has since been closed, Ocracoke, Beaufort, Swansboro, and Wil- 
mington. He was then to open for flatboat navigation the Roanoke, Tar, Neuse, 
Cape Fear, Yadkin, Catawba, and Broad rivers, and sundry of their tributaries. 
He was to join the Roanoke, Tar or Pamlico, and Neuse rivers by canals, in order 
to ship the productions of the valleys watered by each from the town of Beaufort. 
In the same way he proposed to unite the Cape Fear with Lumber River and at a 
more northerly point with the Yadkin and the Yadkin with the Catawba. In 
this way he hoped to bring to the mouth of the Cape Fear the commerce of the 
whole watershed trending from the Blue Ridge, except that of Broad River, which 
drained into South Carolina. In this way it was expected to make commercial 
marts of Fayetteville and Wilmington. Places remote from water routes were to 
be supplied with an-improved system of roads. 
This plan proposed to supply the State with the most approved means of trans- 
portation then known, for this was before the dawn of the railroad era. The 
comprehensiveness and boldness of the scheme is evident, but it is probable that 
this very comprehensiveness was the cause of failure. To conciliate favor, inade- 
quate appropriations for various parts of the work in all sections of the State were 
madeatonce. Work was commenced under incompetent supervision, and resulted 
in failure. After a few years of trial the whole was abandoned and the engineer 
was discharged. The expenditures for the work from the treasury of the State, 
including the salary of the principal engineer and assistants, was repaid tenfold 
in the topographical and statistical knowledge obtained.! The series of reports 
made to the board of internal improvements between 1818 and 1827 are of much 
value in themselves, and stand as the beginning of geological work in America.? 
Judge Murphey’s devotion to the history of the State was not less than that to 
her internal development. He “studied her interests by every light of political 
economy and every record of the past within his reach, was personally acquainted 
with nearly every citizen of intelligence, and his talents, public spirit, and engag- 
ing manners rendered him a favorite among the surviving officers and soldiers of 
the Revolution.” He gathered materials for her history from many sources, pub- 
lic and private. At his instance’the legislature had the office of the Board of 
Trade examined, and prepared a preliminary list of documents relating to North 
Carolina.’ Literary men,in other States like Jefferson and Madison aided his 
efforts, family archives were thrown open to his inspection, and some of the Revo- 
lutionary leaders then surviving furnished reminiscences. Under date of Decem- 
ber 5, 1825, Judge Murphey submitted to the legislature the plan on which he 
proposed writing the history of the State. His outline was an admirable one. 
He divides his work into seven parts: (1) An account of the discovery of America; 
(2) the aboriginal history of North Carolina; (3) the colonial history of North 
Carolina; (4) history of North Carolina from the time of her becoming a sovereign 
  
1The expenditures for internal improvements from December, 1827, to November 1, 1840, _ 
amounted to $653,626.86. From the beginning in 1817 to November 1, 1840, the expenses wero 
$968,773.84, 
2Fulton’s engagement with the State ended with the end of 1825. The next year he was in 
the employ of the State of Georgia at a salary of $5,000. Alanson Nash, who had been recom- 
mended by De Witt Clinton, was employed by North Carolina in 1827. His engagement closed 
with the end of 1828. In 1838 Charles B. Shaw, who had done similar work for Virginia, was 
employed. 
Ss Laws of 1826-27. This list was printed in 1843, and this effort of Judge Murphey bore fruit 
sixty years later in the magnificent series of Colonial and State Records of North Carolina, 
whose publication was begun in 1886. It now extends to fifteen quarto volumes, and has not yet 
been finished.

State in 1776; (5) physical geozraphy, soil, climate, and meteorology of North 
Carolina; (6) geology and mineralogy of North Carolina; (7) botany of North 
Carolina, the sylva, flora, and fungi of the State. Under (3) and (4) the social 
history of the State was fully developed. 
He asked the State for assistance toward the publication of this great work. 
This aid was never granted. Sick in body and broken in fortune, Judge Murphey 
sank to his grave February 3, 1832, and his historical work, beyond a few chap- 
ters on the Indians, was never finished. The State, with characteristic prodi- 
gality, allowed his great collection of historical materials to be scattered, and the 
labors of the first native historian of North Carolina were seemingly in vain. 
As we have seen, Judge Murphey was chairman of the committee in the legis- 
lature of 1816 to which was referred that part of the governor's message concern- 
ing education He brought in a report, in part as follows: 
“That after forty years of successful experiment, the most skeptical can not 
doubt the excellence of the system of government which we have adopted. 
““A republic is bottomed upon the virtue and intelligence of her citizens; and that 
virtue consists in the faithful discharge of moral and social duties and in obedience 
to the laws. But it is knowledge only that lights up the path of duty, unfolds the 
reasons of obedience, and points out to man the purposes of his existence. In a 
government, therefore, which rests upon the public virtue, no efforts should be 
spared to diffuse public instruction. ... 
“To effect this benevolent purpose, a judicious system of public education must 
be established. Few subjects present more serious difficulties; none is of more 
vital importance. . . 
“Your committee feel proud to look back and review the efforts which have 
been made in North Carolina to diffuse public instruction. Few States have 
afforded such examples of private munificence for this purpose, and the legis- 
lature has lent its fostering care, by establishing a university and endowing it 
with funds. But your committee regret that success has not attended these benev- 
olent efforts of their fellow-citizens as they seem to have merited, and they enter- 
tain the fear that no better success will hereafter attend them until a general 
system of public education shall be established and enforced by the legislature. 
This general system must include a gradation of schools, regularly supporting 
each other, from the one in which the first rudiments of education are taught to 
that in which the highest-branches of the sciences are cultivated. Itis to the first 
schools in this gradation that your committee beg leave to draw the attention of the 
legislature at this time, because in them will be taught the learning indispensable to 
all—reading, writing, and arithmetic. These schools must be scattered over every 
section of the State, for in them education must be commenced and in them it 
will terminate as to more than one-half of the community. These schools will be 
the most difficult in their organization and the most expensive to the State; but 
they will be the most useful, inasmuch as all the citizens of the State will be 
taught in them, and many of these children are destined never to be taught in 
any other. Here their education will begin and end. With the learning which 
they here acquire, they will pass into active life and take rank with their fellow- 
citizens. It is important, therefore, that in these schools the principles of moral- 
ity and religion should be inculcated and habits of subordination and obedience 
formed. ... Thousands of unfortunate children are growing up in perfect igno- 
rance of their moral and religious duties. Their parents, equally unfortunate, know 
not how to instruct them, and have not the opportunity or ability of placing them 
under the care of those who could give them instruction. The State, in the 
warmth of her affection and solicitude for their welfare, must take charge of 
those children, and place them in schools where their minds can be enlightened 
and their hearts trained to virtue. There is another class of unfortunate-children 
who are objects of anxious solicitude. These are the children of the poor, whose 
parents, bereft of the comforts of life, are rendered doubly wretched by seeing 
their children bereft of the opportunities of education. How often among these 
children do we discover the most promising genius? And how often has not this 
genius been seen to burst the fetters which enchained it to the bed of poverty, and 
towered its way to wealth and honors? Genius delights to toil with difficulties; 
they discipline its powers and animate its courage. Hence it has happened that 
many whose elevation has been preeminent and whose virtues have adorned 
humanity have been born in the iap of poverty. The State must take into her 
bosom the poor children and feed and clothe and educate them at the public 
expense. Such of them as give proofs of genius and hopes of future usefulness

should be transferred to schools of higher grade, and eventually brought forward 
into active life under the public patronage. . . 
** From these youths teachers may be selected for the schools in which they are 
qualified to teach; and as they have been educated at public expense because they 
were poor, they must, in return, teach gratuitously the poor children placed under 
their care; and to stimulate them to honest and active exertions, let those who 
shall faithfully discharge their duty in teaching, for the time required of them, be 
rewarded for their fidelity by being advanced into higher schools and instructed 
in the sciences at the public expense. 
«Discreet persons must be appointed in each county to superintend and manage 
the concerns of the sectional schools which shall be established, and to designate 
the children who shall be educated in part or in the whole at the public expense. 
The application of the funds which shall be consecrated to the purposes of these 
schools shall be made by them. 
‘«There yet remains one class of unfortunate human beings who have peculiar 
claims upon our humanity and who must not be overlooked in a plan of public 
instruction. These are the deaf and the dumb. 
“To carry into effect any general system of public instruction much expense 
must be incurred. But your committee rejoice that the state of our finances will 
shortly put it in the power of the legislature to appropriate nearly half a million 
of dollars for this purpose and not yet withhold the appropriation which shall be 
necessary to complete the system of internal improvements now under consid- 
eration. 
“Your committee recommend to the two houses to adopt the following resolu- 
tion: 
“* Resolved, That the speakers of the two houses of the general assembly appoint 
three persons to digest a system of public instruction, founded upon the general 
principles of the foregoing report, and to submit the same to the consideration of 
the next general assembly." ! 
The House concurred t swith. 
Judge Murphey was accordingly made the chairman of a committeeto continue 
the investigation of the subject and to make a further report at the next session of 
the assembly. In the meantime he made a careful study of the school system of 
New England and visited Europe to examine the continentalsystems. The results 
of these studies are embraced in the report made to the assembly on November 
27,1817. That report marked the beginning of a new educational era in North 
Carolina, and was the basis of the common-school system of the State until the 
end of the civil war. It has long been out of print and is reproduced here in full, 
“The Committee to whom were referred the so much of the Message of his 
Excellency the Governor, as relates to public instruction, Report In Part;? 
“That we have much reason to thank Providence for the arrival of a period, 
when our country enjoying peace with foreign nations, and free from domestic 
nae nde turns her attention to improving her physical resources, and the moral 
intellectual condition of her citizens. The war of party spirit which for 
twenty years has disturbed her tranquility and perverted her ambition, has 
terminated; and political strife has yielded its place to an honorable zeal for the 
public welfare, Enlightened statesmen will avail themselves of this auspicious 
period to place the fortunes of the state upon a basis not to be shaken; to found 
and cherish institutions which shall guarantee to the people the permanence of 
their government, and enable them to appreciate its excellence. The legislature 
of North Carolina, giving to their ambition an honorable direction, have resolved 
to improve this period for the best interests of the State; to adopt and carry into 
effect liberal plans of internal improvements; to give encouragement to literature, 
and to diffuse the lights of knowledge among all classes of the community. Let 
us foster the spirit which has gone abroad; it will lead to the happiest results. If 
we ourselves should not live to witness them, we shall at least have the satisfac- 
tion of having contributed to produce them, and of seeing our children receive 
from our hands acountry growing rich in physical resources, and advancing in 
moral and intellectual excellence. This is the true way of giving strength and 
permanence to the government; of giving to it root in the hearts of the people,

and nurturing it with their affections. What people will not love a government 
whose constant solicitude is for their happiness, and whose ambition is to elevate 
their character in the scale of intelligent beings. Having commenced this great 
work of Humanity, let us persevere in it with a patience that shall not tire, and 
with a zeal that shall not abate; praying to the Father of all good, that he will 
enlighten and direct our course and finally crown our labors with success. 
“Your committee have entered upon the duties assigned to them with a full 
conviction of their importance, and of the difficulties which attend their discharge. 
But believing that let the subject be taken up when it may, those difficulties will 
exist, and availing themselves of the light thrown upon the subject by the wis- 
dom of others, they have prepared a system of public instruction for North Caro- 
lina, which with much deference they beg leave to submit to the consideration of 
the General Assembly. In digesting this system, they have adhered to the gen- 
eral principles of the report on this subject, submitted by a committee to the last 
Legislature, and have embraced a provision for the poor as well as rich, and a 
gradation of schools from the lowest to the highest. 
“To give effect to any general plan of public education, it is essentially neces- 
sary that ample funds be provided, and that these funds, and also the execution 
of the general plan, be committed to the care and direction of a board composed 
of intelligent and efficient men. Your committee reserve for a more special report 
their views with respect to the creation of a fund for public instruction. This 
subject requires a minuteness of detail, which would only embarrass the general 
views which it is their object now to present to the consideration of the General 
Assembly. 
“‘ Your committee have considered the subject referred to them under the fol- 
lowing divisions: 
“ist, The creation of a fund for Public Instruction. 
“2d. The constitution of a board to manage the fund and to carry into execu- 
tion the plan of public instruction. 
“3d, The organization of schools. 
“4th, The course of studies to be prescribed for each. 
“Sth. The modes of instruction. 5 
“6th, The discipline and government of the schools. 
“7th. The education of poor children at the public expense. 
“8th, An Assylum for the deaf and dumb. 
“Having reserved for a more special report the creation of a fund for public 
instruction, your committee will first submit their views with respect to the con- 
stitution of a board for the management of this fund, and the execution and 
superintendence of the general plan of education which they recommend. 
‘6 THE BOARD OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
“As the whole community will be interested in the plan of education, the mem- 
bers of the board should be selected from different parts of the State. They have 
charge of all our literary institutions; and to give more weight and respectability 
to their deliberations and resolves, the governor of the State should be placed at 
their head. It will be their province to manage and apply the fund committed to 
their care, to carry into execution from time to time as it shall be found practica- 
ble, the different parts of the plan of public education; to superintend the same 
when in full operation; to prescribe general rules and regulations for the discipline 
and government of the schools; to make annual reports to the legislature of their 
proceedings and of the state of the schools under their charge. Your committee 
do therefore recommend, 
“1st, That there shall be elected by joint ballot of the two houses of the Gen- 
eral Assembly, six directors, who shall be styled ‘The board of public instruction;’ 
that three of the directors shall reside at or to the eastward of the city of Raleigh, 
and three shall reside at or to the westward thereof. 
“2d, That the governor for the time being, shall be ‘ex officio’ president of the 
board; but the board may appoint a vice president who shall preside in the absence 
of the governor. 
‘°3d. The board shall appoint a secretary and such other officers as may be nec- 
essary for conducting their business, who shall receive a reasonable compensation 
for their services. 
“4th, Until otherwise ordered, the members of the board shall receive the same 
compensation for their traveling to and from the place of their meeting; and the 
same ‘per diem’ during their attendance on the board, as is now allowed by law 
to members of the General Assembly. They shall hold an annual meeting in the 
city of Raleigh at or near the time of the meeting of the General Assembly. The

president of the board may at his own pleasure, or shall at the request of any two 
directors thereof, convene extra meetings of the board for the transaction of any 
extraordinary business. A majority of the whole number of directors-shall be 
necessary to constitute a board for the transaction of business, but the president 
or any single director may adjourn from day to day until a board be formed. 
“5th. The board may at any time enact, alter or amend such rules as to them 
may seem proper for the purpose of regulating the order of their proceedings; 
they may adjourn for any period or meet at any place, where they may think the 
public interest shall require. They shall have power, subject to the limitations to 
be provided by law, to establish and locate the several academies directed by law, 
to be established; to determine the number and titles of the professorships therein; 
to examine, appoint and regulate the compensation of the several professors and 
teachers; to appoint in the first instance the trustees of the several academies; to 
prescribe the course of instruction and discipline of the several academies and 
primary schools, according to such general rules as shall be established by law; to 
provide some just and particular mode of advancing from the primary schools to 
the academies, and from academies to the university, as many of the most meri- 
torious children educated at the public expense, as the proceeds of the fund for 
public instruction may suffice to educate and maintain, after the whole system of 
public instruction hereby recommended, shall have been put in operation; to 
manage the fund for public instruction, and apply its proceeds in carrying into 
execution and supporting the plan of education committed to their care; and in 
giving effect to this plan, the board shall regard the primary schools at its foun- 
dation, and care shall be taken that the proceeds of the fund for public instruc- 
tion, shall not be applied to the establishment of any academy, so long it is prob- 
able that such an application may leave any primary schools unprovided for. And 
the board shall have power to enact, alter or amend such bye-laws rules and regu- 
lations relative to the various subjects committed to their trust, as to them may 
seem expedient: Provided the same be not inconsistent with the laws of the State; 
and they shall recommend to the General Assembly from time to time, such gen- 
eral laws in relation to public instruction, as may in their opinion, be calculated 
to promote the intellectual and moral improvement of the State. 
“6th. The directors of the board of public instruction for the time being shall, 
ex officio, be trustees of the university of this State. 
“7th, The treasurer of the State shall have charge of the fund for public 
instruction, and the proceeds thereof shall be paid upon warrants drawn by the 
president of the board; and all expenses incurred in carrying into effect the system 
of public instruction and supporting the same, shall be charged upon this fund 
and paid out of the proceeds thereof. 
“8th. The board of public instruction shall annually submit to the General 
Assembly at or near the commencement of their session, a view of the state of 
public education within the State, embracing a history of the progress or declen- 
sion of the University in the year next preceding, and illustrating its actual con- 
dition and future prospects; and also setting forth the condition of the fund 
committed to their trust for public instruction. 
“9th, The board of public instruction shall be a body politic in law; shall have 
a common seal and perpetual succession; shall by the name and style of ‘The 
Board of Public Instruction,’ be capable of suing and being sued, pleading and 
being impleaded; and shall have and enjoy all the rights and privileges of a ecr- 
poration. 
“THE ORGANIZATION OIF SCHOOLS. 
“Tn arranging the system of schools, your committee have endeavored to make 
the progress of education natural and regular; beginning with primary schools, in 
which the first rudiments of learning are taught, and proceeding to Academies, 
in which youth are to be instructed in languages, ancient and modern history, 
mathematics and other branches of science, preparatory to entering into the Uni- 
versity, in which instruction is to be given in all the higher branches of the 
sciences and the principles of the useful arts. 
“Tn making this arrangement the greatest difficulties have occurred in organiz- 
ing the primaryschools. These difficulties arise from the condition of the country 
and the State of its population; it being found impossible to divide the State into 
small sections of territory, each containing an adequate population for the support 
of aschool. Any attempt to divide the territory of the State into such small sec- 
tions, with a view of locating a school in each, would prove unavailing; and how- 
ever desirable it may be, that a school should be established convenient to ever: 
family, the time has not arrived when it can be done. But so far as it is practi- 
cable to extend the convenience it should be done. The primary schools are of the

first importance in any general plan of public education; every citizen has an 
interest in them, as the learning indispensable to all, of reading, writing and 
arithmetic, is here to be taught. By judicious management and a proper selection 
of books for children while they are learning to read, much instruction in their 
moral and religious duties may be given to them in these schools. Your commit- 
tee have diligentiy examined the different plans of public instruction which have 
been submitted to the general assembly of our sister State, Virginia, and also those 
which have been carried into effect in some of the New England States; they have 
also examined the plan which was drawn up and adopted by the national conven- 
tion of France, and which now forms the basis of public instruction in all the 
communes of that empire; and deriving much aid from this examination upon 
every part of the subject referred to them, they have suggested a system which 
they hope may be found to suit the conditions of North Carolina. In designating 
the schools of different grades, they have adopted the names in common use,— 
Your committee do therefore recommend that as to 
‘*THE PRIMARY SCHOOLS. 
“1. Hach county in this State be divided into two or more townships; and that 
one or more primary schools be established in each township, provided a lot of 
ground not less than four acres and a sufficient house erected thereon, be provided 
and vested in the board of public instruction. And that every incorporated town 
in the State containing more than one hundred families, shall be divided into 
wards. Such town containing less than one hundred families shall be considered 
as forming only one ward. Each ward upon conveying to the board of public 
instruction a lot of ground of the value of two hundred dollars or upwards, and 
erecting thereon a house of the value of two hundred and fifty dollars, shall be 
entitled to the privileges and benefits of a primary school. 
«2. The court of Pleas and Quarter sessions shall annually elect for each town- 
ship in their respective counties, five persons as trustees of the primary schools to 
be established in such township, who shall have power to fix the scites of the pri- 
mary schools to be established thereon, superintend and manage the same, make 
rules for their government, appoint trustees, appoint teachers, and remove them 
at pleasure. They shall select such children residing within their township, whose 
parents are unable to pay for their schooling, who shall be taught at the said 
schools for three years, without charge. They shall report to the board of public 
instruction, the rules which they may adopt for the government of said schools, 
and shall annuaily report to the said board the state of the schools, the number 
and conduct of the pupils, and their progress in learning; the conduct of the 
teacher, and also every thing connected with the schools of any importance. 
°3. In addition to the pupils who are to be taught free from charge, the teacher 
of any primary school may receive as many other scholars, and at the rates, which 
the trustees of the school may establish; and the trustees may purchase for the 
use of the pupils educated at the public expense, such books, stationery and other 
implements for learning, as may be necessary. 
«4th, The teacher of each primary school shall receive a salary of one hundred 
dollars, to be paid out of the fund for public instruction. 
‘This plan for establishing primary schools is simple, and can easily be carried 
into execution. It divides the expenses of these schools between the public and 
‘those individuals for whose immediate benefit they are established; it securesa 
regular stipend to the teachers, and yet holds out inducements to them to be 
active and faithful in their calling; and it enables every neighborhood, whether 
the number of its inhabitants be few or many, to have a primary school, at the 
chcap price of a small lot of ground, and a house erected thereon, sufficient for 
the purposes of the CGO Ware these schools in full operation in every section 
of ae State, even in the present state of our population, more than fifteen thou- 
sand children would be annually taught in them, These schools would be to the 
rich a convenience, and to the poor, a blessing. 
“ ACADEMIES. 
‘After children shali have gone through the course of studies prescribed for 
the primary schools, those of them who are to be further advanced in education, 
will be placed in the Academies, where they will be instructed in languages, 
ancient and modern history, mathematics and other branches of science prepara- 
tory to their entering into the University. The Academies shall be located in 
different districts of the State for the convenience of the people, and the expenses 
of purchasing suitable sites and erecting thereon the necessary buildings, shall be

divided between the public at large and the several districts. Private liberality 
has of late erected many small Academies in the State, which deserve the consid-. 
eration and patronage of the Legislature. From the benefits which have accrued 
to the public from these small Academies, we may form an opinion of the good. 
which would fiow from larger institutions which would flow from larger institu- 
tions of the same sort, if regularly located throughout the State, and aided with 
suitable funds. The state of learning among us will never become respectable 
until we have such regular Academical institutions—Your committee do therefore 
recommend, : 
‘ist. That the board of public instruction shall divide the State into ten Aca- 
demical districts, containing each, one or more counties, and as near as practicable, 
an equal number of white population, and number the districts from one upwards. 
‘2d. When in any of the districts there is an Academy already established, the 
trustees thereof may submit to the board of public instruction, a report on the 
actual condition of their institution, its relative position to the boundaries of the 
district, t e number and dimensions of the buildings, their value and state of 
repair, the extent of ground on which they are erected; the number and denomi- 
nation of the professors and teachers employed therein, and of the pupils educated. 
thereat. If the board should think the Academy properly situated for the benefit. 
of the district, and that its buildings and grounds will answer their intended pur- 
poses, notice thereof shall be given to the trustees; and upon conveyance being 
made of the said ground and houses to the board of public instruction, the acad- 
emy shall be entitled to the same benefits which may be extended to any acaflemy 
that may be erected, and shall be subject to the same rules and regulations in 
relation to the government thereof, which the board of public instruction or the 
general assembly may provide for the general government of the academies of 
the State. But the trustees of such academies may continue to hold their offices. 
and to supply vacancies occurring in their body. 
“3d, In case the buildings of any academy already established and so accepted 
by the board of public instruction, require repair or any enlargement or altera- 
tion, the board shall appropriate a sum sufficient to repair, alter or enlarge the 
said buildings, provided the sum so appropriated shall not exceed one-third part: 
of the entire value of such buildings, when so altered, repaired or enlarged. The 
alterations or enlargement of the buildings shall be planned by the board of pub- 
lic instruction and executed according to their order. 
“4th. In any academical district where there is no academy now established, or 
none which the board of public instruction shall think will answer their intended 
purpose, the board may accept a lot of ground, of sufficient extent in their estima- 
tio nd conveniently situated for the erection of an academy for the district; 
provided that two-third parts of the sum required for the erection of suitable 
buildings for the said academy be previously subscribed by one or more persons, 
and the payment thereof assured to the board of public instruction. 
5th. When any conveyance of the lot of ground on which the buildings 
are erected, shall be accepted of by the board, they shall appoint eleven persons 
res ding within the district, trustees of the academy, who shall be deemed a body 
corporate by such title as the board of public instruction shall prescribe; shall 
have and enjoy all the rights and privileges of a corporation; shall have power to. 
elect a president from their own body, and to fill all vacancies which shall occur 
therein. They may make, alter or amend, such bye-laws, rules and regulations, 
as they shall deem necessary or expedient, for the government of their own 
body, and of the professors, teachers and pupils of the academy of which they 
have charge: provided they be not inconsistent with such general regulations as: 
the board of public instruction may provide for the general government of the 
academies of the State. 
“6th. The trustees shall provide by contract for the erection of the necessary 
buildings for their academy, and appoint a treasurer who shall have authority to 
collect the several sums subscribed thereto, and shall be entitled to receive in 
virtue of their order upon the board of public instruction, signed by their presi- 
dent, such sums of money as the board may, from time to time, appropriate for 
the erection of the buildings, their repairs or alterations, salaries of professors: 
and teachers, and other purposes of the academy. 
‘““7th. As soon as any academy is ready for the admission of pupils, the trustees 
may recommend to the board of public instruction, any person to be a professor 
or teacher therein, who, if approved after examination in some mode to be pre- 
scribed by the board, shall be regarded as a professor or teacher of such academy, 
but subject to removal at the pleasure of the trustees or of the board. Where 
vacancies shall occur among the professors or teachers during the recess of the 
ED 97. 89

board, the trustees may make temporary appointments, to be confirmed or dis- 
approved by the board at their next session. 
“8th. The trustees of any academy may fix the salaries of their respective 
teachers, subject to the control of the board of public instruction: One-third part 
of the salaries shall be paid by the board at such times and in such way as they 
shall prescribe. 
“Oth. The professors and teachers in any academy shall be bound to instruct, 
free of charge for tuition, the pupils whom the board of public instruction may 
designate'to be taught in said academy at the public expense. 
“Your committee have perhaps gone into unnecessary details respecting the 
academies. Their plan simply is, to divide the State into ten academical districts, 
and that one academy be erected in each; that the State shall advance one-third 
of the sum required for the erection of necessary buildings, and one-third of the 
sum to be paid in salaries to professors and teachers—making it their duty to 
teach poor children free of charge. 
“THE UNIVERSITY, 
“This institution has been in operation for twenty years, and has been emi- 
nently useful to the State. It has contributed, perhaps, more than any other 
cause, to diffuse a taste for reading among the people, and excite a spirit of liberal 
improyement; it has contributed to change our manners and elevate our character; 
it has given to society many useful members, not only in the liberal professions, 
but in the walks of private life; and the number of its pupils who are honored 
with seats in this legislature is a proof of the estimation in which they are held by 
their fellow-citizens. When this institution was first founded, it was fondly hoped 
that it would be cherished with pride by the legislature. But unfortunately the 
nature of the funds with which it was endowed, in a short time rendered it odious 
to some, and cooled the ardor of others. The torrent of prejudice could not be 
stemmed; the fostering protection of the legislature was withheld, and the insti- 
tution left dependent upon private munificence. 
‘Individuals contributed not only to relieve its necessities, but to rear up its 
edifices and establish a permanentfund foritssupport. At the head of these indi- 
viduals, stood the late Governor Smith, Charles Gerard and Gen. Thomas Person. 
The first two made valuable donations in lands, and the last, in a sum of money 
with which one of the halls of the university has been erected. To enable them 
to complete the main edifice, the trustees have been compelled to sell most of the 
lands devised to them by Mr. Gerard, and as the lands conveyed to them by Goy- 
ernor Smith lie within the Indian boundary, the trustees have not been able as yet 
to turn them to a productive account. With the aid thus derived from individ- 
uals, together with occasional funds derived from escheats, the institution has 
progressed thus far. The Legislature, after exhausting its patience in endeavor- 
ing to collect the arrearages of debts due to the State, transferred to the trustees 
of the University those arrearages, with the hope that they would be able to enforce 
payment. Butno better fortune has attended their efforts than those of the State, 
and this transfer has proved of no ayail to the institution. The surplus remaining 
in tho hands of administrators where the next of kin have made no claim within 
seven years, have also been transferred to the trustees; but this has as yet yielded 
a very small fund, and probably never will yield much. The legislature have 
enlarged the rights of inheritance, and in this way have nearly deprived the insti- 
tution of the revenue from escheats. Amidst all these embarrassments, the trus- 
tees have never lost sight of the necessity of accumulating a fund in bank stock, 
the annual proceeds of which would enable them to continue the operations of the 
institution; and they have succeeded so far as to be able to support two professor- 
ships, and employ two or three tutors. But there is little prospect of adding to 
this fund, until the lands given by Governor Smith can be sold; and if that period 
be waited for, the institution must necessarily languish and sink in respectability. 
It is at this moment almost destitute of a Library, and entirely destitute of the 
Aparatus necessary for instructing youth in the mathematical and physical sci- 
ences. Add to this, that one half of the necessary buildings have not been erected, 
“In this state of things, and at a moment when former prejudices have died 
away, when liberal ideas begin to prevail, when the pride of this State is awaken- 
ing and an honorable ambition is cherished for her glory, an appeal is made to the 
patriotism and the generous feelings of the legislature in favor of an institution, 
which in all civilized nations, has been regarded as the nursery of moral greatness, 
and the palladium of civil liberty. That people who cultivate the sciences and 
the arts with most success, acquirea most enviable superiority over others. Learned

men by their discoveries and works give a lasting splendor to national character; 
and such is the enthusiasm of man, that there is not an individual, however hum- 
ble in life his lot may be, who does not feel proud to belong to a country honored 
with great men and magnificent institutions. It is due to North Carolina, it is 
due to the great man,' who first proposed the foundation of the University, to fos- 
ter it with the parental fondness and to give to it an importance commensurate 
with the high destinies of the State. Your committee deem this subject of so 
much interest, that they beg leave in a future report to submit to the two houses 
a plan for increasing the funds of the University. 
«This institution has uniformly labored under the double disadvantages of a 
want of funds, and the want of subsidiary institutions, in which youth could be 
instructed preparatory to their entering upon a course of the higher branches of 
science in the University. This latter disadvantage has been so great, that the 
trustees have been compelled to convert the University, in part into a grammar 
school. This disadvantage has been of late removed in part, by the establishment 
of academies in different parts of the State; but it will continue to be much felt, 
until regular academical institutions shall be made and the course of instruction 
prescribed for them. 
«Another serious disadvantage and a consequence of tho one last mentioned, is 
the necessity which the peculiar state of academical learning has imposed upon 
the trustees, of conferring the honorary degrees of an University upon young men 
who have not made that progress in the sciences, of which their diploma purports 
to be a testimonial. This is an evil that is found in almost all the Universities of 
the Union. A young man enters into an University with only slight acquire- 
ments in classical education, and after remaining four years, during which time 
he is instructed in only the outlines of the general principles of science, he receives 
a degree: the consequence is that he leaves the University with his mind trained 
only to general and loose habits of thinking: and if he enters into professional 
life, he has to begin his education anew. The great object of education is to dis- 
cipline the mind, to give to it habits of activity, of close investigation: in fine, to 
teach men to think, And it is a reproach upon almost all the literary institutions 
of our country, that the course of studies pursued in them teach most young men 
only how to become literary triflers. Their multifarious. occupations dissipate 
their time and attention: They acquire much superficial knowledge; but they 
remain ignorant of the profounder and more abstract truths of philosophy. 
Indeed the road to the profound sciences is of late so infested with pleasant ele- 
mentary books, compilations, abridgments, summaries and encyclopedias, that 
few, very few, in our country ever travel it. 
*‘To remove this reproach upon the state of learning among us, a new plan of 
instruction in our university must be organized; a plan which shall give to the 
different classes in the institution, an arrangement founded upon a philosophical 
division of the present improved state of knowledge; and which in its execution 
shall train the mind both to liberal views and minute investigation. 
“Your committee have been thus particular in submitting to the two houses an 
exposition of the actual condition of the university, with a view of recalling their 
consideration to the solemn injunction of the constitution as to every part of the 
subject referred to them; ‘that a school or schools shall be established by the 
legislature for the convenient instruction of youth, with such salaries to the mas- 
ters, paid by the public, as may enable them to instruct at low prices; and all 
useful learning shall be duly encouraged and promoted in one or more universi- 
ties.’ Our university is the only institution which the legislature has yet founded 
and endowed in compliance with this injunction; but even as to this institution 
the spirit of the constitution is far from being complied with. We have not 
buildings for the accommodation of youth, nor books, nor apparatus for their 
instruction—your committee do therefore recommend, 
“1st, That three additional buildings be erected at the university; two for the 
accommodation of students, and one for the library and apparatus. This last 
building to contain suitable rooms for the delivery of lectures by the different 
professors. 
“2d. That a library and suitable apparatus for instructing youth in the mathe- 
matical and physical sciences, be procured for the use of the said institution. 
“3d, That funds be assigned for endowing to [two] professorships, and sup- 
porting six additional teachers. 
“These are the present wants of the university; as our population encreases, 
the number of buildings must be encreased, and more funds be provided for sup- 
porting teachers. In a subsequent part of this report your committee have rec- 
  
1Gen. William R. Davie.
-P-A-G-E-284
1412 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
ommended that there be four classes in the university with a professor at the 
head of each, who shall be assisted with such adjunct professors or teachers, as 
the state of the institution may require. 
““THE COURSE OF STUDIES. 
“1st. In the primary schools should be taught reading, writing and arithmetic. 
A judicious selection of books should from time to time be made by the board of 
public instruction for the use of small children: Books which will excite their 
curiosity and improve their moral dispositions. And the board should be empow- 
ered to compile and haye printed for the use of primary schools, such books as 
they may think will best subserve the purposes of intellectual and moral instruc- 
tion. In these books should be contained many of the historical parts of the old 
and new testament, that children may early be made acquainted with the book 
which contains the word of truth, and the doctrines of eternal life. 
«2d, In the academies should be taught the Latin, Greek, French and English 
languages. the higher rules of arithmetic, the six first books of Huclid’s elements, 
Algebra, Geography, the elements of Astronomy, taught with the use of the Globes, 
ancient and modera history. The basis of a good education is classical and mathe- 
matical knowledge; and no young man ought to be admitted into the university 
without such knowledge. 
“3d, In the university the course of education should occupy four years; and 
there should be four classes, to be designated. 
“1st. The class of languages—In this class should be studied, ist. the more 
difficult Latin, Greek and French classes: 2d. Ancient and modern history: 3d. 
Belles letters: 4th. Rhetoric, 
2d, The class of mathematics—In this class should be studied, Ist. Pure mathe- 
matics: 2d. Their application to the purposes of physical science. 
‘*3d. The class of physical sciences.—In this classsshould be taught, 1st. Physics: 
2d. Chemistry: 3d. The philosophy of natural history: 4th. Mineralogy: 5th. Bot- 
any: 6th. Zoology. : 
“4th. The class of moral and political science.—In this class should be taught. 
ist. The philosophy of the human mind: 2d. morals: 3d. The law of nature and of 
nations: 4th. Government and legislation: 5th, Political economy. 
‘““THE MODES OF INSTRUCTION, 
«The great object of education is intellectual and moral improvement; and that 
the mode of instruction is to be preferred which best serves to effect this object. 
That mode is to be found only in a correct knowledge of the human mind, its 
habits, passions, and manner of operation. The philosophy of the mind, which in 
ages preceding had been cultivated only in its detached branches, has of late years 
received form and system in the schools of Scotland. This new science promises 
the happiest results. It has sapped the foundation of scepticism by establishing 
the authority of those primitive truths and intuitive principles, which form the 
basis of all demonstration; it has taught to man the extent of his intellectual 
powers, and marking the line which separates truth from hypothetical conjecture, 
has pointed out to his view the boundaries which Providence has prescribed to 
his enquiries. It has determined the laws of the various faculties of the mind, 
and furnished a system of philosophic logic for conducting our enquiries in every 
branch of knowledge. 
«This new science has given birth to new methods of instruction; methods, which 
being founded upon a correct knowledge of the faculties of the mind, have emi- 
nently facilitated their development. Pestalozzi in Switzerland and Joseph Lan- 
caster in England, seem to have been most successful in the application of new 
methods to the instruction of children. Their methods are different, but each is 
founded upon a profound knowledge of the human mind. The basis of each 
method is, the eacitement of the curiosity of children; thereby awakening their 
minds and preparing them to receive instruction. The success which has attended 
the application of their methods, particularly that of Lancaster, has been aston- 
ishing. Although but few years have elapsed since Lancastrian schoels were 
first established, they have spread over the British empire, extended into the con- 
tinent of Europe, the Island of St. Domingo, and the United States. Various 
improvements in the details of his plan have been suggested by experience and 
adopted; and it is probable that in time, his wil! become the universal mode of 
instruction for children. The Lancastrian plan is equally distinguished by its 
simplicity, its facility of application, the rapid intellectual improvement which it 
gives, and the exact discipline which it enforces. The moral effects of the plan
-P-A-G-E-285
COMMON SCHOOLS OF NORTH CAROLINA. 1413 
are also astonishing; exact and correct habits are the surest safeguards of morals; 
and it has been often remarked, that out of the immense number of children and 
grown persons instructed in Lancaster’s schools, few, very few, have ever been 
prosecuted in a court of justice for any offence. Your committee do therefore 
recommend that whenever it be practicable, the Lancastrian mode of instruction 
be introduced into the primary schools. The general principles of this method 
may be successfully Epiedaueedl into the academies and university: And your 
comunittee indulge the hope, that the board of public instruction, and the profes- 
sors and teachers in these respective institutions, will use their best endeavors to 
. adopt and enforce the best methods of instruction which the present state of 
knowledge will enable them to devise. 
‘THE DISCIPLINE AND GOVERNMENT OF THE SCHOOLS. 
“In a republic, the first duty of a citizen is obedience to the law. We acknowl- 
edge no sovereign but the law, and from infancy to manhood our children should 
be taught to bow with reverence to its majesty. In childhood, parental authority 
enforces the first lessons of obedience; in youth, this authority is aided by the 
municipal law which in manhood wields the entire supremacy. As the political 
power and the social happiness of a state depend upon the obedience of its citi- 
zens, it becomes an object of the first importance to teach youth to reverence the 
law, and cherish habits of implicit obedience to its authority. Such obedience 
not only contributes to the strength and tranquility of the state, but also consti- 
tutes the basis of good manners, of deference and respect in social intercourse. 
But in our country, youth generally become acquainted with the freedom of our 
political institutions, much sooner than with the principles upon which that 
freedom is bottomed, and by which it is to be preserved; and few learn, until 
experience teaches them in the school of practical life, that true liberty consists 
not in doing what they please, but in doing that which the law permits. The 
consequence has been, that riot and disorder have dishonored almost all the col- 
leges and Universities of the Union. 
‘The temples of science have been converted into theatres for acting disgraceful 
scenes of licentiousness and rebellion. How often has the generous patriot shed 
tears of regret for such criminal follies of youth?. Follies which cast reproach 
upon learning, and bring scandal upon the state. This evil can only be corrected 
by the moral effects of early education; by instilling into children upon the first 
dawnings of reason, the principles of duty, and by nurturing those principles as 
reason advances, unti! obedience to authority shall become a habit of their nature. 
When this course shall be found ineffectual the arm of the civil power must be 
stretched forth to its aid. 
“The discipline of a University may be much aided by the arrangement of the 
buildings, and the location of the different classes. Each class should live together 
in separate buildings, and each be under the special care of its own professors and 
teachers. A regular system of subordination may in this way be established; each 
class would have its own character to maintain, and the Esprit de Corps of the 
classes would influence all their actions. Similar arrangements may, in part, be 
made in the several academies, and the like good effect expected from them. 
“The amusements of youth may also be made auxiliary to the exactness of dis- 
cipline. The late president of the United States, Mr. Jefferson, has recommended 
upon this part of the subject, that through the whole course of instruction at a 
college or university, at the hours of recreation on certain days, all the students 
should be taught the manual exercise, military evolutions and manoeuvers, should 
be under a standing organization as a military corps, and with proper officers to 
train and command them. There can be no doubt that much may be done in this 
way towards enforcing habits of subordination and strict discipline—ii will be 
the province of the board of public instruction, who have the general superintend- 
ing care of all the literary institutions of the state, to devise for them systems of 
discipline and government; and your committee hope they will discharge their 
duty with fidelity. 
‘““THE EDUCATION OF POOR CHILDREN AT THE PUBLIC EXPENSE. 
“One of the strongest reasons which we can have for establishing a general 
plan of public instruction, is the condition of the poor children of our country. 
Such always has been, and probably always will be the allotments of human life, 
that the poor will form a large portion of every community; and it is the duty of

1414 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
“* Providence, in the impartial distribution of its favors, whilst it has denied to the 
poor many of the comforts of life, has generally bestowed upon them the blessing 
of intelligent children. Poverty is the school of genius; it is aschool in which the 
active powers of man are developed and disciplined, and in which that moral 
courage is acquired, which enables him to toil with difficulties, privations and 
want, From this school generally come forth those men who act the principal 
parts upon the theatre of life; men who impress a character upon the age in which 
theylive. Butitis aschool which if left to itself runs wild; vice in all its depraved 
forms grows upinit. The State should take this school under her special care, and 
nurturing the genius which there grows in rich luxuriance, give to it an honorable 
and profitable direction. Poor children are the peculiar property of the State, and 
by proper cultivation they will constitute a fund of intellectual and moral worth, 
which will greatly subserve the public interest. Your committee have therefore 
endeavored to provide for the education of all poor children in the primary schools; 
they have also provided for the advancement into the academies and university, of 
such of those children as are most distinguished for genius and give the best assur- 
ance of future usefulness. For three years they are to be educated in the primary 
schools free of charge; the portion of them who shall be selected for further 
advancement, shall, during the whole course of their future education, be clothed, 
fed and taught at the publicexpense. Thenumber of children who are to be thus 
adyanced, will depend upon the state of the fund set apart for public instruction, 
and your committee think it will be most advisable to leave the number to the 
discretion of the board, who shall have charge of the fund; and also toleave tothem 
the providing of some just and particular mode of advancing this number from 
the primary schools to the academies, and from the academies to the university. 
“AN ASYLUM FOR THE DEAF AND DUMB. 
“If there be any of our species who are entitled to the public consideration of 
the government, it is surely the deaf and dumb. Since the method of instructing 
them in language and science has been discovered, numerous asylums in different 
countries have been established for their instruction. While we are engaged in 
making provision for others, humanity demands that we should make a suitable 
provision for them. Your committee do therefore recommend that as soon as the 
state of the fund for public instruction will admit, the board who have charge of 
that fund, be directed to establish at some suitable place in the State, an asylum for 
the instruction of the deaf and dumb. 
“Your committee have now submitted to the two houses their general views 
upon the subject referred to them. They have proposed the creation of a fund for 
public instruction, the appointment of a board to manage this fund, and to carry 
into effect the plan of education which they have recommended. This plan 
embraces a gradation of schools from the lowest to the highest, and contains a 
provision for the education of poor children—and of the deaf and dumb. 
«““When this or some other more judicious plan of public education, when light 
and knowledge shall be shed upon all, may we not indulge the hope, that men will 
be convinced that wisdom’s ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are 
paths of peace; and be induced by such conviction to regulate their conduct by 
the rule of christian morality, of doing unto others as they wish they would do 
unto them; and that they will learn to do justly, to love mercy and to walk hum- 
bly before their God. 
_ Your committee will forthwith report bills to carry into effect the several 
measures recommended in this report. 
“Respectfully submitted, 
“A, D. MURPHEY, Chairman.” 
This elaborate report was ordered to be printed, and a bill was prepared by the 
committee to carry into effect the several measures recommended. The bill even 
passed its first reading in both houses.! It would have heen difficult at that day 
to prepare a better, more compact, or more connected scheme for the organization 
of a State system, but it undertook too much; it proposed not only to educate, but 
also to maintain the children of the poor. This was quite beyond the power of the 
State to perform, for it was but sparsely settled and was still burdened with the 
debt of recent wars. The friends of the measure declined to eliminate this espe-

cially impracticable feature of the bill. They desired its passage as a whole; sup- 
port fell from it and it failed. 
There was some desultory discussion on the question of public schools during 
the next eight years. Governor Holmes mentions agricultural education in 1822 
and complains of the ‘crowds of drones that hang upon the rear of the learned 
professions.” In 1824 a committee was appointed “‘to digest and report to the 
present session a plan of primary schools,” and a bill was introduced for the edu- 
cation of the poor. Governor Burton renewed the question in 1825.   
VI. Tur Litmrary BoarpD anp ITs Work, 1825-1840. 
With the act for the creation of a literary fund ends what may be called the 
period of the private schools. From this time the common schools begin to come 
to the front, although it was more than a quarter of a century before this move- 
ment became important. Now for the first time did the State begin to provide 
for the ‘‘ school or schools” which the constitution of 1776 had instructed her to 
establish. The report of Judge Murphey had been presented to the general 
assembly in 1817. The initial act relating to schools came in 1825, when the State 
began to accumulate a fund for the public schools, the theory being that it would 
not be well to depend on current taxation for two reasons then prevalent. One 
was that taxes were to be levied only for the support of the machinery of govern- 
ment, of which the common schools were nota part; the second was because these 
schools were looked on as of the nature of a public benevolence or charity. 
The sources of the literary fund were fixed by chapter 1 of the laws of 1825. 
This act was drawn by Bartlett Yancey,' then speaker of the senate, who had been 
in earlier years a law student in Murphey’s office and was now his able and faith- 
ful coadjutor in the cause of the common schools. The fund was vested ina cor- 
porate body known legally as ‘‘the president and directors of the literary fund,” 
putin popular parlance as ‘the literary board.” It consisted of the governor of 
the State, the chief justice of the supreme court, the speaker of the senate, the 
speaker of the house of commons, and the treasurer, for the time being, and their 
successors in office. They were given corporate powers and invested with control 
of the literary fund. This fund, ‘‘the parings of the treasury,” as Yancey him- 
self styled it, was to be ‘‘ applied to the instruction of such children as it may 
hereafter be deemed expedient by the legislature to instruct in the common prin- 
ciples of reading, writing, and arithmetic,” and was defined by the same act as 
consisting of— 
«The dividends arising from the stock now held and which may hereafter be 
acquired by the State in the banks of Newbern and Cape Fear, and which have 
not heretofore been pledged and set apart for internal improvement; the dividends 
arising from stock which is owned by the State in the Cape Fear Navigation Com- 
pany, the Roanoke Navigation Company, and the Clubfoot and Harlow Creek 
Canal Company; the tax imposed by law on licenses to the retailers of spirituous 
liquors and auctioneers; the unexpended balance of the agricultural fund, which, 
by the act of the legislature, is directed to be paid into the public treasury; all 
moneys paid to the State for entries of vacant lands (excepting the Cherokee 
lands); the sum of $21,090, whith was paid by this, State to certain Cherokee 
Indians for reservations to land secured to them by treaty, when the said sum 
shall be received from the United States by this State, and of all the vacant and 
unappropriated swamp lands in this State, together with such sums of money as 
tho legislature may hereafter find it convenient to appropriate from time to time.” 
JOSEPH CALDWELL AND HIS MONITORIAL SYSTEM. 
After the creation of the literary fund there was another pause of seven years. 
Then came the Letters on Popular Education, by Rev. Joseph Caldwell, president 
  
1See article on his work, probably by Wiley, in North Carolina Reader, revised edition, pp. 
269-272.   
 
-P-A-G-E-288
1416 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
of the university. These letters were eleven in number and grew out of the 
work of a standing committee appointed by the legislature from the community 
at large to report on the subject of general education.' The committee never 
met. A report was prepared by the chairman, accepted by the other members, 
and sent in, but it called for the creation of funds so vast as to preclude its prac- 
ticality. Dr. Caldwell was a member of this committee. The substance of the 
letters brought together in pamphlet form in 1832? had been commenced more 
than two years before in the Raleigh Register, under the signature of “Cleveland.” 
The central idea in these letters was to encourage the organization of the moni- 
torial system in the State. Dr, Caldwell begins his argument by noticing some 
of the obstructions in the way to the advance of education. He says: 
“Another obstruction meets us in our aversion to taxation beyond the bare neces- 
sities of government and the public tranquillity. ... A still further difficulty is 
felt in the indifference unhappily prevalent in many of our people on the subject 
of education. ... I might mention further, as one of the greatest obstructions 
the scattered condition of our population A most serious impediment is 
felt in our want of commercial opportunities by which, though we may possess 
ample means of subsistence to our families, money is difficult of attainment to 
build schooihouses and support teachers. . . .”    
As to the relative significance of these various obstructions, he says: 
“ With respect to the difficulty arising from our aversion to taxation, I am ready 
to admit—nay, conclusively to affirm—that it must and will be fatal to every 
scheme of popular education to which it is made necessary. As to a spirit of hos- 
tility against knowledge and a determination upon principle to sustain the cause 
of ignorance and to exclude all education asa foe to human happiness and to true 
republicanism, the portion of our people who hold such opinions is too small to 
contend with the great body of our citizens, who for the honor of our State, it is 
verily believed, are of entirely different sentiments. ... Ourresources doubtless 
fail for want of commercial privileges. But this obstacle, too, ceases if some plan 
for the diffusion of education can be effected by means already at our command. 
It will be forever vain to meditate plans of legislative action if we persist in 
looking to means which the people have given prescriptive evidence that they will 
never adopt. Why continue to press schemes from year to year, involving the 
necessity of taxation? ... Thousands of parents are ready to second any practi- 
cable system by which education may be accessible to their children. . . .” 
He then discusses the methods that were ordinarily followed to provide for pop- 
ular education. One was voluntary, where the matter is left entirely to the 
people; a second was by the intervention of the legislature; a third was a combi- 
nation of the other two. The first had been followed in North Carolina. This 
had disadvantages: 
“The evil which is really the greatest of all is the want of qualified masters. [t 
may be difficult to obtain a teacher at all, but it is pretty certain in the present 
state of the country not one is properly fitted for the occupation. Do we think 
that of all the professions in the world that of a schoolmaster requires the least 
preparatory formation? If we do, there can not be a more egregious mistake. 
For if any man arrived at years of maturity, who can read, write, and cipher, 
were taken up to be trained to the true methods of instructing and managing an 
elementary school by a master teacher who understood them well, he could scarcely 
comprehend them and establish them in his habits in less than two years. .. . 
‘In the present condition of society and of public opinion the occupation of a 
schoolmaster, in comparison with others, is regarded with contempt. It would 
be wonderful were it otherwise, when we look at the manner in which it is very 
often, if not most usually filled. Is aman constitutionally and habitually indo- 
lent a burden upon all from whom he can extract a support? Then there is one

and Joseph Caldwell. The date of its appointment is uncertain.

way of shaking him off; let us make him a schoolmaster. To teach a school is, in 
the opinion of many, little else than sitting still and doing nothing. Has any man 
wasted .all his property or ended in debt by indiscretion and misconduct? The 
business of school keeping stands wide open for his reception, and here he sinks to 
the bottom for want of capacity to support himself. Has any one ruined himself 
and done all he could to corrupt others by dissipation, drinking, seduction, and a 
course of irregularities? Nay, has he returned from a prison after an ignominious 
atonement for some violation of the laws? He is destitute of character and can 
not be trusted, but presently he opens a school and the children are seen flocking 
into it, for, if he is willing to act in that capacity, we shall all admit that, as he 
can read and write and cipher to the square root, he will make an excellent school- 
master. In short, it is no matter what the man is, or what his manners or prin- 
ciples, if he has escaped with life from the penal code, we have the satisfaction to 
think that he can still have credit as a schoolmaster. . . .” 
He then reviews the public-school methods of Connecticut and New York and 
enters into a computation to show what would be the cost of supplying the coun- 
ties of North Carolina with a given number of schools. There were 64 counties 
in the State. If these counties were given one school each, at a cost of $50 each 
per year, there would be an expenditure of $3,200, representing, if capitalized at 
6 per cent, a fund of $53,338. If 16 schools were allowed to the county, which 
it was estimated would place a school in each 8 square miles of territory, the 
principal needed would be $853,333. If these schools cost $100 per year, instead of 
$50, the principal would be $1,706,666. 
‘*To raise a fund of a million and a half of dollars, we must be taxed to the 
amount of a hundred thousand dollars annually for fifteen years. Is this within 
thelimits of probability? 1tis presumed that no one will pronounce that itis. ... 
Our habits are at variance with taxation for any purpose beyond the bare neces- 
sities of governmental subsistence. .. . It is nowsubmitted to the dispassionate 
consideration of those who look to New York or Connecticut for plans of popular 
education, whether the proposal and discussion of them is likely to be attended 
with any other consequences than apprehension in the general mind that the 
whole subject of education is hopeless. . . . 
“JT have mentioned some difficulties in the way of making provision for general 
education, most of which it is probably in our power to supersede. But one there 
is of which in our present situation this is not to be said, and until itis removed 
it would prove alike fata] to all that could be proposed. Itis the want of teachers 
qualified for the business of instruction, whatever be the mode of instituting and 
maintaining schools. . . . It will be seen in the course of these letters that an 
institution for preparing schoolmasters for their profession is regarded asa neces- 
sary and in the first instance at least as a competent provision in our own State 
for general education. .. . 
““¥t is well known to have been an object for many years past in British India 
to discover and put in practice the most effectual methods of diffusing Christan 
civilization among the population of that country. It was in the prosecution of 
this object that Bell instituted his system of mutual instruction. It was soon con- 
sidered as the most successful plan of instruction in elementary schools. Its pecul- 
iarities were so various, and so much depended upon familiar acquaintance in the 
teacher with these peculiarities, that few could adopt them from description, and 
none could fully understand and apply them in practice without witnessing the 
processes through which the pupils were passed in the whole course of their edu- 
cation. It was on this account deemed expedient to establish institutions called 
‘central schools,’ whose purpose was to train up teachers qualified to take charge 
of schools as they might be formed in every place and conduct them with the 
necessary skill. The reason why they were denominated central schools obviously 
occurs. They were points of emanation, fountains of light, from which knowl- 
edge was to be propagated in every direction till it should reach the extremities 
of the empire... . 
“Tt is in our power without delay to commence an efficient plan of popular edu- 
cation, by providing such a corps of instructors and offering them to the people 
upon terms to which few or none could think beyond their ability. We havea 
literary fund to the amount of $80,000 or $100,000. Let it forthwith be profitably 
invested. Let its annual interest be applied for the erection of a central school; 
that is, an institution for preparing schoolmasters upon the most improved methods 
of instruction. Let a head teacher be selected, with time and opportunity for 
inquiry, from the whole field of the United States, and asalary be atlowed him, to
-P-A-G-E-290
  1418 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
take charge of the institution, and in the central school let him train men sent to 
it from all the counties of the State... .” 
Dr. Caldwell then discusses the organization and the form the administration 
of the central school should take: 
“The literary fund of North Carolina amounts, if I mistake not, to $100,000. 
This is SDI sufficient for the creation and support of the institution of which 
we speak... . 
«Whether grounds should be annexed for manual labor and to aid in the sub- 
sistence of the candidates is an inquiry worthy of consideration. Z 
“The school commissioners being appointed, they are to govern themselves by 
the rules prescribed by the legislature. For a limited time, previously published, 
they will receive the names of such applicants for education to the profession of 
teachers as shall choose tooffer. From these they will select as many as the county 
will consent to support at the central school at $100 each per year through the time 
required for completing an education. If more than $100 be necessary, let it be 
added by themselves or their friends, 
“The candidates, before admission, may be required to enter into bond with 
competent security to the county commissioners, that should they afterwards 
desert the profession for which they are thus educated at the public expense, they 
shall replace the sum expended by the county upon their education. 
«The central school should always have one or more primary schools of children 
and young persons connected with it, for exemplification to the candidates of the 
instruction in such schools. These being conducted under the direction of the 
principal who receives a salary, should afford tuition gratuitously to the pupils. 
“It is evident that when the masters educated in the central school return to 
their counties, their services are supposed to be for the benefit of such neighbor- 
hoods as will erect schoolhouses, and proffer the sum requisite by law for the 
tuition of their children.” 
THE GROWTH OF THE LITERARY FUND. 
After the letters of Dr. Caldwell, the next movement was the act of 1836-37, “‘to 
drain the swamp lands of this State and to create a fund for common schools” 
* (chap. 23), and the act “to provide for the draining of Mattamuskeet Lake” 
(chap. 25). The first of these made some change in the composition of the literary 
board, providing that it should consist of the governor and of three other members 
appointed by him with the advice of his council; enumerated the property that 
was to be turned over to the literary board; appropriated $200,000 for its use in 
draining the swamp lands and authorized them to employ an engineer for the 
work. For the draining of Mattamuskeet Lake, $8,000 was appropriated. The 
same legislature instructed the board to digest and report on a system of public 
schools. This was made in 1888, and is summarized further on (see p. 1420). The 
legislature of 1838 passed an act under which organization of the schools began. 
This was superseded in 1840 by a better act. In the meantime it may be interest- 
ing to trace the growth of the literary fund from its beginning November 1, 1825, 
until 1840. 
The literary board was organized January 16, 1827, under the law of 1825. It 
consisted of Hutchins G. Burton, governor, as president; John Louis Taylor, chief 
justice; Bartlett Yancey, speaker of the senate; James Iredell, speaker of the house 
of commons, and John Haywood, treasurer. The receipts, income, of the fund on 
February 1, 1827, amounted to $12,724,954, and on November 1, 1828, the fund 
itself amounted to $77,811.624, mostly*in bank stock. In 1829 there were no dis- 
bursements, and the income arising from receipts, interest, etc., for the year was 
$16,308.18, In 1830 it was $30,152,884; in 1831, including special gift from the 
legislature, $74,476.484; in 1832, $88,156.614, with no expenditures. In his message 
to the legislature on November 18, 1833, Governor Swain said that the aggregate 
amount of the literary fund was as yet ‘‘too small to justify our entering upon 
any general system of education. Indeed, were this fund much larger, it may be 
well doubted whether the period has yet arrived when it can be judiciously 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
  COMMON SCHOOLS OF NORTH CAROLINA. 1419 
expended.” The sparseness of population was the great trouble. The governor 
felt that inlets must be opened, roads improved, canals dug, railroads built, and 
agriculture improved before much could come to the schools. The report of the 
literary board for 1833 shows $117,024.814, with no expenditures. The board had 
declined to invest in the United States Bank and so the entirefund wasidle. This 
report discussed in detail the draining of the swamp lands, especially Mattamus- 
keet Lake. The literary board worked in full sympathy with the board of internal 
improvements. Both made a strong appeal for more attention to the methods of 
communication. It was said that the departure of so many young men from the 
State was due to this fact alone, for lands had ceased to have value when measured 
in produce, and farmers were land sellers that they might emigrate and none were 
land buyers. 
In 1834 the fund amounted to $139,403.994, which was invested in 1,200 shares of 
stock in the Bank of the State of North Carolina. There were other investments 
in 1835. As yet nothing had been done for the schools. The literary board, in fact, 
seemed to look on itself as little more than an agent for the investment of funds, 
and its reports are almost entirely financial in character. Further, the State, cor- 
porations, and individuals looked on the fund as a reserve on which they could 
draw in time of need. Asaresult, there were none to urge the cause of the schools, 
Governor Spaight reported on November 22, 1836, that the estimated value of the 
fund was then $242,045.09. 
About this time the Federal Government passed the act to distribute the surplus 
revenue. TheState of North Carolina received from this distribution $1,433,757.40. 
The legislature provided that $300,000 of this fund should go to the redemption of 
the public debt; $300,000 was appropriated for stock in the Bank of Cape Fear, 
and $200,000 for draining the swamp lands of the State. Both of the latter invest- 
ments were for the benefit of the literary fund.' The amount received for the two 
years ending November 1, 1838, the sessions of the legislature having been made 
piennial instead of annual, and the reports of the State officers being changed to 
agree with it, was $682,984.62, - This included the $500,000 received from the Fed- 
eral Treasury. 
The whole of the-literary fund, as reported to the legislature of 1838, including 
stock, swamp lands, and other sources, was $1,732,485. 
The special report to the legislature of 1838 reviews the permanent property as 
follows: 
‘<A million of acres of swamp lands of uncertain value; 5,000 shares of stock in 
the Bank of the State, and 5,207 shares in the Bank of Cape Fear, subscribed at 
$100 per share; 500 shares of stock in the Roanoke Navigation Company, subscribed 
for at $100 per share, and probably worth half the sum; 650 shares in the Cape Fear 
Navigation Company (500 subscribed for at $50 and 100 at $100 per share), subject 
toalike depreciation; the dividends on 6,000 shares of stock in the Wilmington 
and Raleigh Railroad Company, subscribed for at $100 per share; and 175 shares 
in the Clubfoot and Harlow Creek Canal Company, subscribed for at $100 per 
share, the latter of no marketable value.” 
The permanent fund from other sources of revenue were to be added: 
The tax imposed by law upon the retailers of spirituous liquors, the tax on auc- 
tioneers, all moneys paid into the Treasury on entries of vacant lands (except 
Cherokee lands), and all profits accruing to the State for subscriptions to works 
ce Eycrnal improvement and from loans made from the internal improvement 
und.? 
The estimated annual income from all sources, the bank stock being above par 
and the navigation below, was $111,000.

  THE REPORT OF 1838, 
The literary board, under date of December 4, 1838, made a full report to the 
legislature. In this report the chairman says: = 
“The board have given to this subject attentive and anxious consideration, and 
taken pains to procure all the information within their reach which seemed 
essential to enlightened legislation. . . 
«They regret to be compelled to state in connection with this topic that their 
efforts to procure still more important information with respect to the actual 
state of education in North Carolina have been much less successful, and that no 
means at their command will enable them to obtain such facts as are indispen- 
sable to the proper discharge of the duty required at their hands. 
“The reports to the senate in 1816 and 18i7, by the late Judge Murphey, the 
letter of Charles R. Kinney, esq., communicated to the general assembly by Goy- 
ernor Owen in 1828, and the letters of the late President Caldwell, originally pub- 
lished in the newspapers and republished in pamphlet form in 1832, have been 
procured not without difficulty. They contain many valuable suggestions, and 
will well reward the labor of the most careful examination; but they are all emi- 
nently wanting in that which individual effort is incompetent to supply—the 
precise and minute statement of facts by which alone the accuracy of their 
theories can be tested. 
“The memoir on the subject of internal improvements and on the resources and 
finances of the State, published by Judge Murphey in 1819, is the first and only 
essay that has been made toward the compilation of a system of statistics almost 
as indispensable to intelligent legislation on the leading interests of the State as a 
well-arranged account book to the proper management of individual affairs. . . .” 
The report, after considering the size of North Carolina, her diversity of popu- 
lation, and the probable amount of illiteracy, reviews the permanent property and 
other sources of revenue that was committed to the board for school purposes, and 
continues: 
“To devise a system, then, which shall secure instruction in reading, writing, 
and arithmetic for 150,000 children dispersed through the State in the ratio of 
three to every square mile, with the resources stated, would seem to be the pre- 
ciso duty required of the board by the last general assembly. . . . Our condition 
is not unfayvorabie to the establishment of common schools. We have the neces- 
sary resources, and need nothing but the will to apply them liberally and the 
intelligence to apply them with discretion. . . . 
The board then unfolds its scheme for the organization of the schools of the 
State and considers the difficulties in the way of the same. 
“The districts having been designated and the requisite schoolhouses erected, the 
difficult question returns upon us, How are instructors to be provided? No one 
capable of forming correct opinions upon the subjeci and conversant with the 
state of things around us can suppose for a moment that we can find 1,250 prop- 
erly qualified instructors in North Carolina or any considerable proportion of this 
number. They can not be had from the North, if it were desirable to employ 
others than those reared in our State, for the difficulty of obtaining them is much

1832, and which indeed constituted his only plan and hope for the improvement of 
our common schools. We must establish normal schools for the education of our 
own teachers, and we need entertain no hope of accomplishing the favorite object 
of the State in any other way... . 
“Tf a system of common schools of this or similar extent should find favor with 
the general assembly, it will next become necessary to inquire more particularly 
into the amount of expenditure it will involve and the manner in which the 
requisite funds can be provided. 
“The net annual revenue of the literary fund, as at present constituted, can 
not, as before remarked, be less than $100,000, and will robably exceed that sum. 
The act of 1825, creating the fund, provides that it chaltine distributed among the 
several counties in proportion to their white population. No illustration can be 
necessary to show that this sum, unassisted from other sources, is wholly inade- 
quate to the maintenance of any general system of education. The distribution 
of the fund set apart for this purpose, however, should not be made until the citi- 
zens of each county shall have decided in favor of the scheme ait the ballot box 
and the justices of the county court shall have levied and coliected twice the 
amount that the county shall be entitled to receive from the State. . . . 
“To superintend, direct, and control the whole of this complicated but not 
inharmonious machinery, a superintendent of common schools must be selected, 
Perhaps there is no office in the State so difficult to fill well, as there is certainly 
none of such incalculable importance. For such a station no character is too 
exalted, no amount of learning too varied and extensive, no talents too command- 
ing, no benevolence too active or expansive. He must direct the normal schools, 
visit and examine every section of the State, devise the principle on which it shall 
be districted, furnish the model of the schoolhouses, devise the mode for examin- 
- ing and licensing teachers, select the series of text-books and see that they are 
invariably used in every school, devise forms of reports, to be required annually 
from each instructor, that shall contain all that is necessary to be known with 
respect to the condition, government, and police of the school, and Drepare a SyS- 
tematic digest of the whole, to be submitted to the general assembly. . 
As a result of this report the legislature, by a resolution relative to common 
schools, adopted January 7, 1839, directed the secretary of state to have printed 
the Report on Elementary Public Instruction in Europe, by Prof. C. E. Stowe, 
which had been made to the general assembly of Ohio on December 19, 1837. 
This report dealt mainly with the schools of Russia, of Prussia, and of some of 
the other German states. Tothe North Carolina reprint various other documents 
were attached.! 
The concrete result of the effort made at the session of 1888-1839 for common 
schvuols was ‘‘An act to divide the counties into school districts and for other pur- 
poses.” This act provided that the matter be submitted to vote. In counties which 
voted for schools the justices of the county courts were to elect not less than five 
nor more than ten persons as superintendents of common schools. These superin- 
tendents were to divide the county into common-school districts of not more than 
6 miles square, and were to appoint for each school district not less than three 
nor more than six school committeemen, whose duty was to assist the superin- 
tendents in matters pertaining to the schools in their respective districts. It was 
provided that the county courts of the counties which voted for schools should 
levy a tax to the amount of $20 for each district in the county. This levy was to 
be supplemented by double that sum, or $40, to each of these districts from the 
State. Provision was made also for a school census.” 
Under the provisions of this law the literary fund contributed during the years 
1839-40 to Tyrrell County $520 for 13 school districts, $640 to Cherokee County

These are the first actual payments to schools from State funds of which I am 
aware. 
VII.—Tar EXPERIMENTAL PERIOD, 1840-1852. 
The preceding is a summary of what was done prior to 1840, when a new law, 
entitled ‘“‘An act for the establishment and better regulation of common schools,” 
was passed, under which the system was reorganized. 
This act! provides that the net annual income of the literary fund was to be 
divided between the counties in profortion to Federal population. The courts of 
such counties as voted for schools in 1838 were to appoint not less than five nor 
more than ten ‘“‘superintendents of common schools,” who were to hold office for 
one year; these superintendents were to elect their own chairman and he was to 
give bond. The funds for each county were made due on September 1 and were 
payable to the chairman. The county court was “authorized and empowered” 
to lay a tax for school purposes ‘‘ which shall not exceed one-half of the estimated 
amount to be received by said county for that year from the literary fund.” The 
tax was to be collected and paid over to the county chairman. The board of 
county superintendents were to lay off the county into school districts. The free 
white electors of each school district were to choose by ballot three men as a 
“school committee ” to serve for one year. These school committees were incor- 
porated and put in charge of the schools. They were to provide houses, make a 
census (between 5 and 21), and employ teachers. ‘Any branch of English educa- 
tion ” might be taught; all white children under 21 were allowed to attend and 
the committee was to visit the schools. The board of superintendents was to fix 
the number of teachers and the funds that were to go to each district, and its chair- 
man was to report all essential facts and statistics to the literary board, having 
received these in turn from the school committees. Those counties which had 
rejected the schools under the act of 1888 were given an opportunity to vote on 
the question again, and those voting for schocls were to be admitted to all rights 
and privileges. The literary board was directed as soon as it was ascertained 
what counties had voted against schools to invest for their future benefit ‘‘so 
much of said fund as said counties would have been entitled to receive under the 
ratio provided for in the first section of this act.” This board was to prepare and 
distribute the forms necessary to carry outthe provisions of the act, and a penalty 
of $50 was provided for refusal or neglect on the part of a county officer ‘to per- 
form the duties required of him by law.” Teachers were exempted ‘from per- 
forming military duty, working on the road, or serving on the jury whilst 
engaged in teaching.” 
Little was done, as we have seen, toward the organization of the schools prior 
to 1840. Having reached this period, it may be well to view the situation as it 
then appeared. 
The condition of the educational interests of the State in 1840, according to the 
census, was as follows: 
Number of colleges and universities 
Number of academies and grammar schools- 
Number of primary and common schools 
    
The total population in 1840 was 753,419. 
  
1 Chapter 7, Laws of 1810-41, ratified January 11, 1841. 
2 This act may be considered the real beginning of the system in North Carolina. It was 
reported to the legislature by Jonathan Worth, afterwards governor, from the joint committee 
on education, of which Senator Mangum was the chairman for the senate and W. N. H. Smith, 
afterwards chief justice, chairman for the house.

    The total number of whites 20 years old and over was 209,685; the number of 
these who could not read and write was 56,609. This means that 27 per cent of 
the adult population of the State could neither read nor write. ? 
The condition of affairs in 1840 can hardly be put into more graphic language 
than that used by Dr. Wiley in his History of the Common Schools of North 
Carolina, published in the North Carolina Educational Journal in 1881. He says: 
“According to the census of 1840, one-third of our adult whites, by their own 
statements to the enumerators, were unable to read and write. This is one fact. 
By the side of this was the fact that our sisters had nearly outgrown us in popu- 
lation and improvements, and yet it was well known to some, and is now a matter 
of common information, that no part of the world enjoyed greater natural advan- 
tages. Our resources from soil and climate, from minerals and timber, fisheries, 
and water power were varied and immense; our colonial and Revolutionary his- 
tory and traditions were honorable; from the establishment of American inde- 
pendence there was no purer government on earth than that of our own State 
and municipal system, and society was moral, peaceful, and secure. 
«We always had an educated class, numbering men and women of the highest 
type for virtue, intelligence, patriotism, and public spirit, and our biographical 
annals, faithfully written, would embellish any history. 
“But development everywhere around us was more rapid than here, and thus, 
comparatively, our course was downward. We labored under one disadvantage, 
and that was the want of streams navigable into the interior; but in other places 
railroads were superseding rivers as commercial highways. The exuberant soil 
and cheap lands of the West allured immigrants, and rapidly covered that vast 
region with industrious people; but there was no such exodus from other States 
as from ours, and some of our Northern sisters, with sterile lands and harsh 
climate, were in the van of improvement, while States south of us, under scorch- 
ing suns and enveloped in a malarial atmosphere, were not only outstripping us, 
but constantly draining us of our capital and enterprise. 
‘*We had sons who would honor any people, but we had no State pride and no 
State system; our people were straining their eyes to the desirable features of all 
other countries but their own, and plants from our human nurseries were shed- 
ding bloom and bearing fruit to beautify and enrich many regions, while their 
native and goodly land was desolate and poor. Our great leaders wrote and spoke 
of North Carolina, but their sketches never reached the masses; and in the hands 
of her common people were common-school histories and popular nursery songs 
of nearly all lands but their own. God has so created nature here that develop- 
ment was preeminently dependent on an intelligent and spirited yeomanry, know- 
ing the resources of their country and attached to their homes; and this was the

one thing needed in North Carolina, the great want for which all her advantages 
offered no compensation. And there were the materials for such a people, a 
working population unexcelled in sobriety, morality, and sturdiness of character, 
industrious, frugal, and conservative. But the masses, generally, were born 
homeless; the better part grew up to move, and for long years the situation was 
not comprehended even by the most sagacious of our leaders. At last the truth 
began to dawn dimly on various classes, and to some it came as an intuition.” 
Again Dr. Wiley very pertinently remarks on the introduction of the school 
ystem: 
“This population was proverbially tenacious of old habits, conservative to the 
point of stubbornness, with no neighboring precedents or examples, and no per- 
sons trained under such systems. The experiment was an absolute novelty in 
this region, the cause occupied little of the thoughts of Southern statesmen, and 
it began among a people inured to light taxes and the less inclined to be taxed 
for education from the fact that there was a large school fund. The accumula- 
tion of the fund was a practical and strong teaching against current taxation, 
and since its inception the principle of distribution was changed from the basis of 
at of Federal population, and thus an element of sectional jealousy and 
added to other inherent trials. The idea of a charity system was con- 
nected with it, rendering it obnoxious to many interested in it, and there were no 
appliances for the instruction and training of the vast number of managers and 
teachers immediately needed, while many of the ‘oid field’ instructors, as the 
teachers of primary subscription schools were called, received it with jealousy, 
prepared to make war upon it.”

Such was the course of the first period of actual trialof the school system. The 
school fund was in good condition and a steady revenue was received from it. 
But the evils of the system were perhaps larger than the good results. In the first 
place, there was no efficient supervision, and under the system in vogue there 
could be none. 
Until 1853 the literary board was the chief executive head of the system. This 
was an awkward arrangement, and the board urged on the legislature the more 
simple and efficient plan of a single executive chief or superintendent. The bien- 
nial reports of the board were mostly confined to this one object, and hence for 
twelve years friends of the schools labored in darkness. As it was, the system 
could not be managed as a whole, and was left largely to local officers and to a public 
wholly unused to such cares. Whatever there was of error was allowed to grow 
unheeded, and there was no published record of progress. 
“Some of the legislative provisions were wise—remarkably so, considering the 
circumstances—and they laid a broad and good foundation, but they could not be 
prudently added to from time to time, and it was impossible for any man to sur- 
vey the whole system in its details, in its wants, and in its results.” 
Returns from the counties could not be enforced, and the result was that hardly 
half made regular reports to the board. No special report by the State authori- 
ties was provided for; consequently there was no general information on the sub- 
ject. The first forms, which were necessarily imperfect, were not improved, and 
were often clumsily filled or entirely neglected. Diverse habits sprang up in 
different counties, and the best county systems, made so by the exertions of dis- 
creet and zealous local friends, naturally felt least interest in State action and in 
the system as a whole, and it was not until 1849 that the various acts relating to 
the common schools were collected and published. The character of much of this 
legislation was permissive. Thus the act of 1846 provided that the board of county 
superintendents might appoint a committee of five to examine “into the qualifi- 
cations, mental and moral,” of applicants for teachers’ positions. Where there 
were such committees persons could not teach without their certificate, but this, 
when given, was little more than a testimonial of moral character. Another rea- 
son for the small success of the schools during the first decade of their existence 
is summarized by Dr. Wiley, in his special report, as follows: 
“Under the constitutional provision of 1776 the schools were not to be charity 
schools. They were to be subsidized by the State, but every man was expected to 
ED 97 90  
-P-A-G-E-298
  1426 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
pay something toward the instruction of his children, but the idea of charity was 
attached to the common schools and the name itself helped to raise a barrier 
between the upper and lower classes of society. It seemed as if these schools were 
to erect a fence between the two. It prevented many from sending their children 
to these schools, and kept the more intelligent part from taking any active part in 
the management of the schools,” 
Further, the common schools were a novelty to the people; they were imported 
from the outside aud did not grow in the soil; hence it took more time for the 
people to understand and appreciate them. They were at first considered asa 
sort of labor-saving machine and expected to work themselves, 
Then came the imperfections of the system itself. The plan adopted in 1840 
was dominated by the ideas in the plan submitted by Judge Murphey in 1817. His 
idea as to a literary board was framed into a law: 
“Tt was enacted that there should be a ‘Board of Literature in this State,’ to be 
called ‘The President and Directors of the Literary Fund of North Carolina;’ so 
called because there was then only a fund and no public schools, This board 
became mere trustees of the fund—they have been useful as such, and as such only 
havo tried to be useful, it being impossible, in the nature of things, that they 
could, without immense cost to the State, officially discharge the duties of the 
head of the public schools, as originally intended by Judge Murphey. Neverthe- 
less, when we established our system of public schools, this literary board was 
made the nominal head—and thus, as I stated, we were still under the influence 
of the erroneous conclusions of one active intellect which thought for us twenty 
years before. This board, however, was but a nominal head, divested of all the 
powers necessary to make it useful as such; and so we launched our experiment, 
so new to our people, so complicated, so liable to difficulty, and cut ourselves off 
from all direct communication with it.” 
Tho radical defects of the system were soon seen and changes were repeatedly 
urged on the assembly. At the end of the first year it was not known how many 
schools had been established; it was not known thirteen years later, for there 
were no means by which the system could observe and note its own deficiencies, 
ascertain its own progress, and record its own experience. 
Another vital defect was the permissive character of the legislation. The lawsof 
1838 and 1840 left it to the counties to say whether they would have the system at 
all. They took their time. In 1840 Governor Dudley said in his message: ‘‘ Most 
of the counties have adopted the common-school system, and a few have received 
the State’s quota of money to aid them.” It was not until 1846 that the school 
system had been adopted in all. The law of 1840 simply ‘‘ authorized and empow- 
ered,” but did not require the counties to levy a local tax, and the effect of this 
laxness was soon felt. In 1844 the literary board says: ‘‘In some counties the 
justices fail to lay any tax whatever for common schools, alleging that the law 
does not impose it as a peremptory duty on them to do so, but leaves it to their 
discretion.” 
In 1848 Governor Graham asked if the counties should not be required to 
raise by local taxation at least one-half as much as they received from the State 
before being paid anything from the State quota. The board said on the same 
subject: 
‘‘Tt seems, however, to be expedient to require of each county imperatively to 
raise by local taxation, annually, a sum equal to at least one-half of that received 
from the State, to the end that schools may be maintained a sufficient portion of 
each year in the several districts, and to withhold from any county her share in 
the State’s distribution until her chairman shall make the report now required of 
him by law.”? 
  
1The census of 1850 gives the total annual income of the public schools from taxation as 
$42,936. The income from all sources, endowment, taxation, public funds and other sources is 
put down as $158,564. The total income of the academies and other schools was $187,648.
-P-A-G-E-299
COMMON SCHOOLS OF NORTH CAROLINA. 1427 
But this requirement was not then made, and not until August 10, 1897, was the 
question of local taxation for schools submitted to the State as a whole. 
One of the most difficult problems which the new system had to solve was how 
the local academies, encouraged to some extent by lotteries granted by the legis- 
lature, were to be brought into relations with it. 
The “‘old field schools,” which this new system supplanted, ‘‘so called,” says Dr. 
Wiley, ‘‘ because generally located on or near worn-out and unfenced fields grown 
over with sedge and scrub pines, and on which were the playgrounds, did not 
number 1,200 in all the State, and were taught by persons widely variant in char- 
acter and qualifications. Some of these were seminaries of learning of a high 
order, conducted by men of mark in their day, and whose labors have exerted a 
wide and lasting influence for good, not only in this but in many other States; 
but the large majority of teachers instructed only in the elementary branches of 
spelling, reading, writing, and arithmetic. English grammar was not taught, 
perhaps, in a majority of the schools, and geography as a general thing was an 
unknown science. The text-books in every branch were few, unattractive, and 
often very defective; but one good result of the want of readers was the general 
use of the Holy Scriptures, and especially of the New Testament. The teacher, 
in most cases a law to himself and a neighborhood oracle, knew little of the 
methods of his brethren in other places, and never regarded himself as an element 
of a general system; and his progress was only in the mechanical art of writing, 
and from years of practice many became masters in penmanship and naturally 
looked with contempt on their brethren of a new generation whose qualifications 
were mental and who had not spent a lifetime in learning to make graceful 
curvatures and flourishes with the quill.” 
On these schools Dr. Wiley says, in his special report in 1855 (yp. 17-20): 
“From the first the facilities for improvement furnished to the masses were very 
indifferent; and down to a period within the memory of the middle aged, and even 
of the younger portion of our citizens, our voluntary subscription system of old 
field schools was, to say the least, utterly inadequate to the necessities of the times, 
giving no promise of ever effecting, within any reasonable period, the object of 
those who framed the clause of the constitution before alluded to. 
«The schoolhouses were few and far between, located in the more thickly settled 
neighborhoods, and bad as are our common schoolhouses, not at all equal to them as 
a general thing in comfort and convenience of arrangement,! while there was not 
a house of any kind expressly dedicated to the purposes of teaching for every 10 
miles square of territory in the State. 
‘‘ The teachers as a class were indifferent scholars; and I say this with high respect 
for a race among whom there were some useful and devoted public servants and 
benefactors. But much as we complain now, salaries then were a good deal lower 
than what they now are; and even had they been equal or larger, the advantage 
in this respect would still belong to the modern cash incomes, promptly paid, over 
the uncertain earnings, which were often long delayed and partof which was very 
frequently paid in barter. There were a great multitude of little collections to 
make, and men of active business habits were not eager to engage in a calling whose 
small profits were as hard to collect as they were to make. The lazy, the lame, 
the eccentric, the crippled, were but too often the ‘old field teachers;’ and while 
many of them could not write their own ‘articles’ (as agreements between teach- 
ers and parents were called), a collection of those written by the masters would 
form a literary curiosity as unique in style, spelling, and chirography as any 
contribution of the kind that could now be made by any class of teachers. 
“The studies pursued were spelling, reading, writing, and arithmetic; and if 
those who applied themselves to them in the old schools succeeded better as men 
and women than those who now study in our common schools, it is another illus- 
tration of the advantages of early hardships, while the praise is due mainly to the 
energy, industry, and perseverance of the pupils and not to the schools.

built of sticks and dirt. Fuel was supplied by brush, which the children were sent out every 
few hours to gather, and about the fire there was a perpetual scramble for the inside position, 
while the young men and women and older children ciphered out of doors in the sun, forming 
very social but not studious little parties on the sunny side of all the surrounding trees.

schools, and many of our middle-age people who now read. the newspapers teeming 
with news from the four corners of the earth, all knit together with railroads and 
telegraphs, feel and complain of their ignorance of the latter study, and would 
give much to be able to trace upon the map the connections and bearings of coun- 
tries formerly seldom heard of and now mixed up with their nearest political and 
religious interests and affecting the prices even of their produce and labor. 
“The method of teaching was extremely primitive; to look on the book and 
make a decent droning noise of any kind, not out of the common key, would insure 
immunity from the all-potent rod, while this habit of noise, pleasant as it is as a 
reminiscence, because it was the music of our early years, was anything else than 
an advantage to those who really wished to bend their minds to study. Hence 
all these, and all who claimed to be such, were allowed to pursue their studies out 
of doors; and among the white heads with which the sunny landscape would 
blossom, perhaps one in every ten would be following out some useful train of 
thought or diving into the mysteries of Dilworth and Pike. He would ‘work out 
the sums’ for all the others, and, as blackboards were unknown, the scholar had 
but torunin, hold up his slate to the teacher, get an approving nod, and return to his 
amusements. There were no lectures, few explanations, no oral instruction; to 
get through the book was the great end, and to whip well the paramount means. 
Few and indifferent as these schools were, they were not generally kept for a longer 
term than the great majority of common schools now are, and the attendance was 
equally uncertainandirregular. Theschools were generally limited to a quarter of 
three months during the coldest part of the winter, and as families with two to six 
children would subscribe half a scholar, the house would often be jammed with 
sixty students and as often hold fifteen or twenty. 
“Half a scholar! Why,can’t we remember when five children would biennially 
get the benefit of the teaching due half a scholar for three months; that is, when 
one and a half months’ schooling every year, or every two years, would be divided 
among three to five children, making six to ten days or more apiece? The good old 
times, which, divested of all romance, of all the tender fancies which naturally 
cluster around the recollections of all childhood, were times which tried the souls 
of those who wished to gain a good education and which throw their still lingering 
shadows upon the present age.” 
VIII. REORGANIZATION AND GROWTH, 1852-1861. 
The common-school system had begun in 1888 with considerable means, and the 
small impression that it created on the thinking people of the State and on the public 
generally proves that it was not considered a part of the governmental machinery, 
but as a local interest with which local authorities could deal largely at their 
discretion. 
The law of 1825 had provided that the distribution of the literary fund should 
be on the basis of the free white population, but the act of 1840 changed the basis 
from white to Federal population. Governor Manly, in his message to the legis 
lature of 1850-51, claimed that the rule adopted in 1840 carried ‘‘ on its face a vio. 
lation of the spirit and object of the injunction of the constitution; is a breach of 
the public faith given by the legislature of 1825; is at variance with the rule in 
other Southern States; divides the fund not according to the public necessity, but 
the wealth of the people, and is in itself unequal and unjust.” The advocates of 
the existing system defended their side with equal vigor, and thus were sown the 
seeds of dissention and jealousy with which Dr. Wiley had to deal during the whole 
of his administration. 
“The system, as then organized, was not only deficient in its organization but 
in accountability, uniformity, and its general management. For a period of ten 
years about $90,000 have been placed annually in the hands of the various school 
committees of the State, a sum larger than the whole amount of the State’s reve- 
nue paid into the public treasury during that period. This large sum, forming 
an aggregate of nearly a million of dollars, has within this brief period been 
spent, and yet no adequate provision has been made, much less enforced, for even 
   
-P-A-G-E-301
  
  COMMON SCHOOLS OF NORTH CAROLINA. 1429 
informing the people or their representatives of what has become of it or how it 
has been spent.” ! 
Governor Manly substantiates his charges by saying further that he had pub- 
lished in 1849 an edition (6,000 copies) of the laws of the assembly relating to the 
public schools (the first of the kind), and had distributed the same, together with 
an appendix of precedents and appropriate forms of returns. These laws required 
that the chairman of the board of county superintendents of each county should, 
within fifteen days of the 1st of November, report in writing to the literary board 
his school accounts, credited by the proper county authorities, together with the 
number of children in the county, the number in the schools for the previous 
year, and the length of time the schools had been kept-open. But this duty was 
performed by only seven superintendents throughout the whole State within the 
specified time. Several came in later, so that at the time of the report to the 
legislature forty-one had been received. This was a little more than one-half. 
It was found that there was still in the hands of the chairmen an aggregate of 
school funds amounting to $90,000. Estimating a like amount in the hands of 
those who had made no returns, it might be said that $180,000 lay unemployed 
and not used for school purposes, besides an indefinite amount in the hands of 
former chairmen and not used for school purposes, 
Governor Manly continues his message in the following strain: 
“Those [chairmen] who choose to do so submit them [their accounts] to the 
committees of finance or county court clerks, while those who fail to do so escape 
forfeiture or censure. It may be safely stated that thousands of dollars remain 
from year to year in the hands of superintendents, and if a rigid settlement were 
enforced the public would be astounded at the aggregate sum thus withheld from 
its legitimate destination. The whole fund annually distributed, although large, 
is yet inadequate to the public exigency. 
“According to the provisions of the existing law, the several county courts may, 
in their discretion, levy a tax as other taxes are levied for county purposes not less 
than one-half of the amount annually received from thé literaryfund. ... Some 
of the counties, with commendable spirit, levy a fair tax, others levy a very small 
one, while very many of the counties levy no tax at all. Hence it results that in 
those counties dependent solely on the literary fund, the sum they receive, when 
subdivided among a large number of districts, is so small for each that many of 
the districts have no schools at all and derive no benefit from the provision. . . . 
Our people do not take hold of the subject with that energy and spirit essential to 
success. A general listlessness prevails. Those that can afford it send their chil- 
dren elsewhere to school, while the poorer classes keep theirs at home to work. 
Throughout the State you see everywhere on the highways schoolhouses deserted, 
the doors broken from their hinges, and the grass growing in the yard. Why is 
this? Besides those already alluded to, one prominent cause, doubtless, is the 
difficulty of procuring proper teachers, qualified by education and good morals 
to direct the young. ... In some of the counties, I am happy to be able to 
say, their schools are well managed, and are accomplishing with marked effect

shown by the following figures: ¢

the beneficent results aimed at by the law, and it is to be hoped that such is the 
case in others. But there is no official information on the subject, and what I 
design to say is that the very want of this information demonstrates the absolute 
necessity of some radical amendment. This necessity suggests the expediency of 
creating a new office in government to take general charge of the whole busi- 
ness, in accordance with the practice in other States and with the earnest and 
repeated recommendation of my predecessors. ... Having been a member of 
the literary board from its organization and having bestowed some attention upon 
the subject, I feel in conclusion fully warranted in recommending as the most 
effectual means of attaining the ends referred to, the appointment of a general 
superintendent of common schools for the State.”! 
Under such pressure as this from the governor, the literary board, and other 
officials, progress was made toward reform. When it is remembered that the 
annual income of the literary fund was more than the income of the State, and 
that this amount was spent and subjected to no general supervision, the import- 
ance of such supervision may be easily seen. 
The legislature of 1848-49 had considered bills for the appointment of a general 
superintendent, but while rejecting them had authorized county superintendents 
at asalary of $250 each. In the legislature of 1850-51, Dr. Wiley, who was then 
a member of the house of commons from Guilford County, introduced a bill for 
the appointment of a State superintendent. The bill had able and enlightened 
friends in both houses; it received favorable consideration and a large vote, but 
failed to pass. 
Dr. Wiley was also a member of the assembly of 1852-58, and through his influ- 
ence a bill for a superintendent was introduced by Mr. Cherry, of Bertie. An- 
other bill to divide the funds among the counties in the ratio of their white popu- 
lation and one to provide for the education of teachers at Normal, Davidson, and 
Wake Forest colleges were also introduced, but these failed to pass. 
Tho “Act to provide for the appointment of a superintendent of common schools, 
and for other. purposes,” stands as chapter 18 in the Public Acts of 1852. Itis 
the corner stone on which was built up the best system of common schools in the 
South before the war, and in brief is as follows: 
It provided for a superintendent of common schools for the State, to be chosen 
by the legislature and to hold office for two years. County chairmen were to 
make their reports to the superintendent on or before the third Monday in Novem- 
ber, and to include, among other items, the number of certificates granted to 
teachers, male and female. In each county there was to be ‘‘a committee of 
examination,” consisting of not more than five members, ‘‘ whose duty it shall be 
to examine into the qualifications, both mental and moral, of all such persons as 
may apply for employment as teachers in any of the common schools.” Certifi- 
cates issued to teachers were good for one year and only in the county where 
issued, and in absence of such certificate payment might be refused. The State 
superintendent was to collect information concerning the condition and operation 
of the common schools in the counties and to report the same to the governor for 
the benefit of the legislature. He was to superintend the operation of the schools, 
' see that the laws were enforced, and look after escheated property. The State 
treasurer was to furnish him an annual statement of the sums disbursed to the 
counties, and he was to issue annually to the examining committees ‘‘a circular 
letter of instructions and suggestions as to the qualifications of teachers.” He 
was to prepare and furnish blanks for the use of county officers and to compile 
and arrange the laws on the subject, together with such other instructions as 
were necessary. He was to make an annual report to the governor, reviewing 
the work of the schools and including statistics, of which ‘‘the governor shall 
cause 150 copies to be printed in cheap pamphlet form, 50 copies for his own use, 
1 This message emphasizes and summarizes the report which Governor Manly had made to the 
same legislature as chairman of the literary board.

and 100 copies for the use of the said general superintendent,” who was ‘as often 
as possible” to deliver public lectures on the subject of education. His salary was 
$1,500.

After securing a new and improved act for the schools and providing for asuper- 
intendent of common schools came the still more difficult task of finding the 
proper man to fill the office. Dr. Wiley was then a member of the legislature from 
Guilford County. He was a Whig in politics and a lawyer by profession, while 
the legislature was Democratic. But the activity displayed by him in advancing 
the interests of the schools pointed him out as the man for the place. He was 
elected, without the slightest solicitation on his part and by a large majority, in 
December, 1852, and entered upon his duties January 1, 1853. 
In the estimation of all others, as well as himself, the superintendent was ‘all 
things to the schools, and had to be, for a time at least, a guide to them, to public 
sentiment, and to the legislature, with no guide or support for himself in the 
community or in the neighboring States.” Dr. Wiley was already well and favor- 
ably known to the people of the State. 
Calvin Henderson Wiley was born near Greensboro, Guilford County, N. C., 
February 3, 1819, and was the son of David L. and Anne Woodburn Wiley. His 
father’s family was of Scotch-Irish stock; William Wiley, his great-grandfather, 
removed from Pennsylvania in 1754, and bought lands from Lord Granville in the 
Alamance section of Guilford; his grandfather, David Wiley, was a Regulator in 
1771, and later a soldier in the Revolution. While still a boy he showed a taste for 
books and reading, and was sent to Caldwell Institute in Greensboro and was 
there prepared for the University of North Carolina, He was graduated from 
that institution in 1840 and already numbered among his friends some of the polit- 
ical leaders of the State. He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1841, and 
located in Oxford. In addition to his practice of law he edited the Oxford     
 
-P-A-G-E-304
1432 ; EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Mercury, 1841-48, Not content with these two activities, he entered the field of 
romance and published in 1847 his first novel, called Alamance, or the Great and 
Final Experiment, which was redolent of the soil of his native section. A second 
novel, Roanoke, or where is Utopia? appeared in Sartain’s Magazine in 1849. In 
1851 he was invited and urged to go to Charlotte -to edit a Whig paper, but 
declined. During that year, however, he associated himself with W. D. Cooke in 
editing the Southern Weekly Post, in Raleigh. The first number appeared Decem- 
ber 6, 1851, and was ‘‘ edited chiefly” by Wiley. Cooke was the publisher. It 
was devoted to the general upbuilding of North Carolina. The announcement of 
this paper, evidently the work of Wiley, strikes the keynote of the policy which 
his paper, and he in all his subsequent work, was to pursue: 
“Tt is a fact worthy of being universally known that North Carolina is con- 
sidered by bookmakers the best mart in the world for uncurrent and trashy pro- 
ductions, and the very refuse of literary quackery is sent out here and circulated 
among our people. For most of the works of this sort Northern publishers have 
agencies all over North Carolina, and thus while there are none to circulate our 
own books, and the people are kept in ignorance of their own history and of the 
character and resources of their State, they are drugged with foreign narcotics 
and heavily taxed for the benefit of fabrics that will not sell and can not be sold 
where they are manufactured.” 
It was with the hope of doing away with or improving on this state of affairs 
that Dr. Wiley entered politics in 1850 as a Whig ‘member of the house of com- 
mons from Guilford County, and began efforts for that series of educational 
reforms which have put him among the leading educational statesmen of the 
South. He assumed his duties as superintendent of common schools January 1, 
1853. During the whole period of his incumbency much of the superintendent’s 
time was taken up with the routine and clerical duties of the office, for he was 
allowed no clerk, His correspondence with local school officers was heavy and 
much of it trivial, He prepared digests of the school laws, gave directions and 
made suggestions to teachers and to committees, made many speeches in all parts 
of the State, and published many articles in the papers. He was forced, moreover, 
to meet many attacks on himself and on the system as a whole from its enemies, 
open and concealed. It was said that he wasted his time or used it for his private 
interests, while he complained that the newspapers failed to devote a proper atten- 
tion to educational affairs, since few were apparently interested, and that there 
were none to stir up a community on education against the coming of the superin- 
tendent, while there were plenty to arouse enthusiasm when a politician was to 
speak, But in the midst of criticism and abuse Dr. Wiley steadily refused to fol- 
low the policy which would keep his own name most prominently before the pub- 
lic. He chose rather to do the humbler work, which was no less necessary, but 
which brought him little personal credit. He was willing to work for the future. 
His first official duty was to prepare a new digest of the State laws relating to the 
schools then in force. These laws went no further back than the act of 1844-45. 
To the collection of acts was added a statement of the forms in which the princi- 
pal of the literary fund was invested (see p. 1431); specimens of the forms to be 
used by the county chairmen in their reports to the State superintendent, and by 
the school committees to the county chairmen, regulations, a circular to the 
chairmen, and an address by the general superintendent ‘‘to the officers of the 
common schools and to the friends of education in North Carolina,” were included 
in his first official publication. 
In the spring of 1853 Dr. Wiley began the active prosecution of his duties. He 
made a tour in his buggy from the middle part of the State to Currituck Court- 
House, in the extreme east, and delivered addresses, according to previous arrange- 
ments, at each county seat. In the summer and fall he traveled in the same way 
to Murphey, in Cherokee County, in the extreme southwest. It is evident that 
trips of this kind would require a large amount of time, but they were made dur-

ing the whole period of his incumbency, and during the earlier part were necessa- 
rily by private conveyance. But as the means of travel became better, public 
methods were used more and less time was spent on the road. But these early 
tours by private conveyance, while they were paid for by the superintendent out 
of his own pocket and cost for the first year nearly half of his salary, were of 
great service; the disabilities and conveniences of different localities were 
observed; visits were made to districts distinguished by special or good features 
and to some schools laboring under peculiar disadvantages. The history and 
progress of the schools in the counties visited was inquired into, the friends of the 
system, teachers, and school officers were interviewed and the system discussed. 
Further, the superintendent made use of the public press at every opportunity. 
There were many misconceptions of the work. These had to be corrected and its 
true mission and spirit made known. Uniformity had to be fostered and a healthy 
public spirit created. The friends of the schools had to be discovered, supplied 
with arguments, and every effort made to keep the movement clear from sectional, 
partisan, and sectarian prejudices. Special efforts were made to show to acade- 
mies, high schools, and colleges their interest in the common schools and to 
enlist the sympathy and cooperation of ministers of all denominations. 
“At that day all of these points, some of which now seem elementary, had to be 
fixed, and some of them after a hard struggle, and the whole system had to be 
purged of the fatal taint of charity once adhering to it, and especially, and after a 
protracted effort, lifted from the position of a beneficence to a class to that of a 
fundamental interest of all the State.” 
These earnest efforts met with great success. The higher schools were brought 
to see their interest and duties in the superintendent’s labors, and denomination- 
alism was kept out of the work. It was the same in the matter of politics. Dr. 
Wiley, a Whig, was elected by a Democratic legislature; he retained and voted on 
his political convictions, but from. the day he went into office had no stronger 
friends than W. W. Holden, of the Standard, and W. J. Yates, of the Charlotte 
Democrat, who were the leaders of the Democratic press.! In the same way all 
the governors from 1853 until the close of the war were Democrats, as were most 
of the other State officers, but they were the friends of Dr. Wiley, and held up his 
hands to the fullest extent. It is safe to say that he won his position through 
merit and retained it largely through a self-respecting neglect of his political 
interests, for on one occasion the Democrats in the legislature moved his reelec- 
tion early in the session to anticipate the rise of party feeling and to lessen the 
chances for a Democratic opponent. 
The first annual report of Dr. Wiley was made to Governor David 8. Reid, and 
is dated January 24, 1854. It is mainly a review of the situation, pointing out the 
weaknesses and difficulties of the schools and the character of the work needed 
for the future, while the survey of what had already been done occupies a subor- 
dinate place. It may be well to summarize the situation as it then appeared. 
He gives the extent and character of his travels from one end of the State to 
the other, for the most part by private conveyance, for only in ten or twelve coun- 
ties could access be had to the county seat in any other way. In his future travels 
he was to be governed to some extent by the character of the reports received, his 
object being to visit the counties that sent in the least satisfactory reports, to 
find out the difficulties in their way, to give them advice and information. 
‘Every citizen of the State ought to be spoken to. . . . I hope in due time to 
reach every man... . There is, also, now a source, however imperfect, of infor- 
mation, and a tribunal to decide or give opinions; and almost daily applications 
to me demonstrate to me the injuries and discouragements heretofore resulting 
from doubts never solved, difficulties never settled, and inquiries never answered.” 
  
1 But neither of these papers, so faras I know, nor the Raleigh Register, the Whig organ, inter- 
ested themselves to any great extent in the agitation which brought about the appointment of 
asuperintendent. This honor was left to the Raleigh Star.

  14384 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
To promote the efficiency and uniformity of the system, he prepared a form of 
certificate to be given to the teacher by the committee of examination. ‘The 
grades are from No. 1, the highest, to No. 5, the lowest, on the studies of spelling, 
reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, and grammar.” Under the law the 
chairman of the county superintendents was authorized to refuse payment to a 
teacher who held no certificate. These certificates were good only in the county 
where issued, and were to be renewed annually. From these it was hoped that 
the happiest results would follow. 
“A crying evil in the State was the multiplicity and frequent change of text- 
books, by which expenses are accumulated on parents and guardians, the prog- 
ress of the school retarded, and teachers greatly embarrassed by having large 
schools with nearly every child in a class by itself. I have often been called on 
to interfere in this matter, and have felt it my duty to use such exertions as the 
Jaw would authorize. The object of my efforts was, first, to drive from our 
schools bad books; second, to prevent frequent and injurious changes—injurious 
alike to parents and to pupils—and third, to secare the use of a uniform series, 
whereby expense would be avoided and teachers would be enabled to arrange their 
pupils in classes.” ! 
His efforts were directed largely to securing the best books for the schools. 
“ Not willing to recommend for the use of the schools of the State books which 
do it injustice, I notified publishers that 1 would not approve of any geography 
unless I was allowed to alter and correct the text so far as relates to North Caro- 
lina. The publishers of different works consented, and having selected Mitchell’s 
Intermediate Geography as best suited under all the circumstances for our com- 
mon schools, I prepared an appendix, which, in a new edition of the work, with 
a full and new map of North Carolina, is now coming out. . . . The new edition 
will be worthy of the patronage of all our schools and will contain, besides the 
new map, several engravings illustrating the description of our State... . The 
time is coming when very material changes will be effected in the routes of com- 
merce. All things considered, the finest agricultural country in the world is the 
valley of the Mississippi and its tributaries. . . . Between thenearer Atlantic and 
this vast granary of the West and Southwest stands the interposing barrier of 
the Allegheny Mountains, long thought to be an impassable wall, and a limit tothe 
iron track of commerce. But modern science has overcome greater difficulties 
to secure that modern desideratum, the shortest passage, and the gallant States 
of Virginia and Georgia are already storming these heights with every prospect 
of success. South Carolina will follow in the assault, and none of these have so 
great inducements to undertake the enterprise as the people of North Carolina. 
Nearly midway of the Atlantic coast, in a temperate and healthy climate, is the 
unchangeable, safe, and capacious harbor of Beaufort; and from hence through 
our fertile upland slopes and the gorges of our own beautiful mountains, lies the 
shortest route to the great Southwest. To foreshadow the grand commercial 
destiny we might attain on the youthful mind of the State and prepare it to grasp 
and realize the magnificent consummation, I took much pains to have all the 
proposed railroads over the mountains and their bearings and connections made 
familiar to the publishers of the geography in question. . . . The State already 
occupies in the work the largest space of any other, with its railroad routes noticed, 
and Beaufort handsomely described.” 
In the matter of school readers Dr. Wiley did not make a recommendation, for 
reasons as follows: 
“Tt is well known that a few years ago I undertook to make a series of North 
Carolina Readers, and published the most important number, for advanced schools, 
containing a familiar history and description of the State, with compositions in 
prose and verse by distinguished North Carolinians. Its object was obvious; and 
to all acquainted with our peculiar position, our desponding and erroneous esti- 
mate of our resources, and the history of that singular and remarkable exodus or 
emigration which for years has retarded our progress in every species of improyve- 
ment, the uses of such a work, well compiled, were fully apparent.” 
For these and other reasons, Dr. Wiley had it at heart to make a good series of 
  
1 As early as 1853 there was a proposition from Pasquotank County to furnish books to the 
pupils at government expense. The proposition was renewed from time to time from other 
quarters.

home readers. Hisown book had been recommended by all the colleges and many 
academies before his appointment as superintendent, but he knew its defects, and 
also determined to make no profit out of any school book used during his term of 
office. He thereupon began negotiations to induce some publisher to take the 
reader at the original cost, on condition that he would employ Professor Hub- 
bard, of the university, ‘‘ or some other person, of equal taste and ability, to alter 
my work and complete the series.” 
Dr. Wiley proposed also under an arrangement which he termed ‘model 
schools” to give the few individuals in a community who were accustomed to 
spend money for education in private schools at a distance a large control in the 
public schools of their district, thus securing a better school for the home district, 
arousing interest in the home school, and saving money. 
The prospects and necessity of normal schools were also considered. Teachers 
were already being educated in the Normal College in Randolph County in return 
for a loan made by the State. ‘Let it be universally understood,” he adds, ‘‘ that 
colleges, academies, and common schools are all bound up in one common interest 
and that the common schools are to the academies and colleges what the back 
country is to commercial cities.” 
The subject of escheats was discussed. These had been transferred to the 
university after the State had exhausted its resources in trying to enforce payment. 
Later they were retransferred to the literary fund, and a suit was brought in the 
Supreme Court of the United States to test the legality of the act. Agents were 
appointed to hunt up this species of property and prosecute the claims of the liter- 
ary fund.! He combats vigorously the strange and foolish idea that a free school 
was a place— 
“where entire freedom of action is to be guaranteed to the pupil; and, entertain- 
ing these erroneous notions, parents not unfrequently prevent the improvement 
of their children by refusing to permit them to be corrected or submit to discipline 
neeseary to chasten and restrain the wayward disposition and the prurient passions 
of youth. 
“Efforts to promote the love of home in the plastic nature of childhood are 
peculiarly becoming in North Carolina, a State where the want of this attachment 
and its ruinous effects are eloquently recorded in deserted farms, in wide wastes 
of guttered sedge fields, in neglected resources, in the absence of improvements, 
and in the hardships, sacrifices, and sorrows of constant emigration. Our State 
has long been regarded by its own citizens as a mere nursery to grow up in, and, 
from my earliest youth, I have witnessed the sad effects of this in the families of 
my acquaintance, many of such being scattered from the homes of their nativity 
over the wide Southwest.” 
He adds statistics of the progress of the schools since 1840. In 1850 the schools 
had been in operation about nine years, and the increase of the white population 
had been about 12 per cent. In 1840 there were 19,483 pupils in schools of all 
grades; in 1850 there were 100,591, or an increase of 500 percent. In 1840 there 
were 632 schools; in 1850 there were 2,131 schools in 70 counties, and perhaps 2,500 
in all; increase in thirteen years, 400 per cent. In 1840 the pupils in the common 
schools were 14,937; in 1853 there were 83,873 in 70 counties, which would indicate 
95,000 for the whole State, or an increase of 600 per cent. During the same period 
the colleges and academies increased in attendance by 150 to 200 per cent. The 
value of the apparatus was three times as much, the number of grammars and 
geographies sold five times as many, and the number of good scholars three times 
asmany. It was not claimed that all the common schools were as good as the 
subscription schools broken down, but it was claimed for every one thus broken 
down there were two just as good in its place, besides three or four other schools 
not so good. The average time during which the schools were kept open was, for 
the whole State, about four months. From the progress made in these ten years 
1Jn 1855 escheats had been restored to the uriversity._Manly to Wiley, February 16, 1855.

Dr. Wiley estimated that the next generation would have 50 per cent less of igno- 
rance than the one then on the stage of action. 
‘«I feel bound to say that money is not our greatest want, and that the places 
where the highest salaries are paid are not generally those which have succeeded 
best. We want more efficient management, a constant embodiment and expres- 
sion of public opinion, a watchful supervision, a liberal course of legislation, good 
officers, and patience and energy in all having an official position in the system.” 
Again, he says in his special report on the same subject: 
“T admit that a considerable number of those who attend school go but a few days 
in the year and learn but little; but it must be borne in mind as a very important 
consideration that many of these are the children of those who never went a day 
to school themselves. Into a mind wholly ignorant it is hard for the light to pene- 
trate, and a man who does not know the alphabet is not sufficiently enlightened 
to feel his ignorance or to appreciate a higher state of improvement. Heisnot upon 
the ladder of knowledge at all, and can, therefore, see no one above him, but as 
soon as he makes a start he can begin to understand his relative position. Hence 
the children of ignorant parents, who get a little smattering of knowledge at our 
common schools, will feel their wants when they take their positions in life, and 
their children, if the same facilities remain, will be much better educated. This 
is a conclusion that can not be gainsaid, and as a large majority of the children of 
that large part of of our population who can not read at all are learning a little at 
our common schools, we may boldly assert that in the second generation that dark 
belt that covers the sixth of our moral surface will nearly wholly disappear, leay- 
ing only a dim outline to indicate its former existence.” (Pp. 28, 29.) 
With the founding of the common schools came two great problems to their 
managers: 
“First. How were eight hundred to a thousand old-field school-teachers to be 
utilized in a system of one genius, one law, and one end, when to each his own 
school had long been the educaticnal world, of which he was the center and soy- 
ereign? These teachers were our only capital, of the kind with which to begin, 
and we all know that it is easier to prepare a new generation of employees in any 
business than to break in old ones long accustomed to their own diverse ways.” 
But the managers of the common schools could not wait and they had no means 
of training, besides it would have been unjust and impolitic to set aside the old- 
field veterans as a class, while their opposition to the new system would have 
insured its failure. ‘And yet to work them into a homogeneous and progressive 
system under a general law, to subject them to annual examinations and licen- 
sure, and to grade their attainments was a task requiring the greatest patience, 
tact, and powers of organization.” The next question was how to find the 1,500 
or 2,000 more teachers that were needed at once, for the position was considered 
humble and the salary was small. The situation was delicate and the superin- 
tendent was aware of its character. The conclusion was reached that the com- 
mon schools must both multiply and improve the teachers whom they needed, 
There was no other practicable method. 
The first step was the establishing of examining boards in all the counties. 
This was no easy task, for there was no salary and no influence attached, and its 
objects seemed to aim at individual freedom and made it unpopular, but after 
a while these examining boards were paid and their value increased. The certifi- 
cates issued allowed the party to teach for one year and in one county only. It 
was found that perpetual permission to teach caused retrogression on the part of 
the party holding such a certificate, and confining the license to one county was 
necessary to give such counties as desired it an opportunity to raise the standard 
of their own schools. Few young people dependent on their own resources cared 
to go into the schools, but the superintendent used all available means to bring to 
the attention of such people a realization of the avenue of advancement open to 
them through the schools. To carry out these plans it was necessary to begin 
with low grades. His rule was to authorize the issue of certificates to persons 
who could teach only spelling, reading, writing, and arithmetic, and who received
-P-A-G-E-309
COMMON SCHOOLS OF NORTH CAROLINA. 1437 
low grades on those subjects, but none were to be relicensed with such a grade, 
and all with grades below the first were expected to improve with each new exam- 
ination, Under such an arrangement it was possible to make the requirements 
for No. 1 exacting. Of the successes of this system Dr. Wiley says: 
“Progress could be more easily marked when there were so many grades, even 
the least advancement could be graded, and advancement became the order of the 
day. Some of the very best teachers and most useful members of society grew 
from the lowest grades, young persons, shut in by poverty and thirsting for knowl- 
edge, would follow my advice and teach on low certificates, studying as they 
taught, and as they acquired means, would attend higher schools, and then go on 
step by step to the most respectable positions in life.” 
There were at this time few women in the schools. In some counties there were 
none. He urged repeatedly that they be encouraged to teach. In his second 
annual letter to county superintendents he says: 
“Encourage as much as possible the very poor, and especially poor females, to 
become teachers. .. . 
“There is, however, a class, a numerous class, who are hired out to field labor, 
and many of these, if properly awakened, could become excellent teachers, and 
make more than twice as much as by their present occupations. . . 
**But a helpless female, who can not push her fortune in the world, and yet is 
born dependent on the labor of her own hands, when started on such a career, 
fairly electrifies surrounding ignorance and prejudice and is a standing miracle 
performed by means of our common schools. Imagine a girl—you can see them 
in your own neighborhood—a girl with natural sensibilities and capabilities—for 
heart and mind are inherited by all ranks and classes—but from her very infancy 
pushed into rude contact with the world, it being necessary for her own existence 
or that of her parents that she be hired out to wages. Whatis the hope before 
her? In the factories she may make $4 to $6 per month, and may preserve her 
character, ehoneh inhaling a noisome atmosphere. In the fields she may earn $3 
per month, . Orsucha one may, for board and coarse clothes, go into domes- 
tic service... . 
“‘There is another road open to such a one leading from want and social inferi- 
ority to independence, to respect, and to usefulness and happiness, and it lies 
through our common schools. . . . 
“And females, for certain classes, make the best teachers. They are more 
patient, more easily win the affections of the young, and are more likely to mold 
to virtuous and refined sentiments the plastic nature of childhood.” 
The schools needed all the help and encouragement that could be drawn from 
the enthusiasm of their superintendent, for his correspondence shows that the 
complaints were neither few in number nor insignificant in character. Many dis- 
tricts were careless. In some cases the money was not appropriated and no schools 
were held for several years. Many of the teachers were incompetent. The com- 
mittees had to take as teachers persons who had never studied English grammar 
or geography. It was necessary to employ those who could only spell and read 
and who had only a moderate knowledge of arithmetic, for these were the only 
kind to be had, while in some districts no children were far enough advanced to 
study grammar. Many school committees refused toserve. Some, if not actually 
dishonest, were careless, and there had been no machinery by which they could be 
brought to a strict account. In some counties, prior to 1853, there had been no 
chairman for two years and in some sections the common schools were patronized 
only by those who were too poor to do better, and from one county it was reported 
that some districts had had no schools in four or five years. There was sometimes 
trouble with the county chairmen, who either failed or refused to report, and ina 
few cases it was found necessary to fine them for their neglect. In some cases, so 
imperfectly was the common-school idea recognized, people moved into the school- 
house and had to be dispossessed by process of law. In some places there was 
trouble over the age limit. Persons over 21 years of age would attend the schools 
and thus crowd out the younger pupils. Trouble also arose from the passing of 
pupils from one school district to another. One case was reported where the
-P-A-G-E-310
1438 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. & Z 
teacher was required to receive pupils coming from another district, but to charge 
them tuition, which the committee undertook to appropriate for their own benefit! 
Some counties would now and then refuse to levy any tax at all for the schools, 
and the amount due from the literary fund was too small to be of any practical 
value. The schools were usually held in the fall, since this was the season when 
pupils could be most easily spared from the work of the farm; they were then 
crowded with the larger boys and girls, who monopolized the teacher and cut out 
the smaller pupils. It was proposed to obviate this difficulty by holding two ses- 
sions instead, one in the fall and one in the spring for young pupils especially. 
The latter were to be taught by women, who were cheaper than men. The ques- 
tion of the teaching of free negroes in the common schools also came up, and there 
was at least one case where a committeeman insisted that they attend. There 
was also more or less discussion as to whether ‘‘silent” schools were superior to 
“noisy” schools, or vice versa. New committees on coming into office would 
sometimes expel the teacher employed by the former committee and put in a new 
one, or they would notify him to quit and refuse to pay his salary. 
These were some of the many questions that came to the superintendent for 
adjudication and settlement. There was also talk of repealing the law. This 
had, of course, a depressing effect on the superintendent and shows itself in his 
report. Dr. Wiley discusses in his second report the leading features of the 
schools as follows: 
A stricter and more uniform and patient attention to the execution of the law. 
Annual reports from the counties should be insisted on, together with a certifi- 
cate as to the correctness of the accounts from the committee of finance, authen- 
ticated by the clerk of the county court. This requirement would compel more 
accurate accounts to be kept, for while the greater part of the money had passed 
through honest hands, ‘‘doubtless a sum sufficient to pay a superintendent for 
twenty years has been carelessly handled, to say the least.” When the county 
chairmen found that strict accounts were not required of them, they in turn 
relaxed their requirements, and after twelve years there was ‘‘a universal com- 
plaint that committees will not make the proper returns.” 
The second subject demanding careful attention, wise oversight, and constant 
exertion by some systematic means was the improvement of teachers. There 
had been great complaint in regard to them; some were incompetent, some were 
unfaithful, and he emphasizes the fact that it is not always the want of money 
which makes indifferent teachers. The salaries paid were not large, but poor 
teachers were paid as much as good ones, and still better ones might be employed 
for the same money. 
“On the contrary, large salaries under the old regulations would often enhance 
the nuisance; it would be an inducement to imposters and adventurers to swarm 
among usin pursuit of the sums thrown out to attract the attention and excite 
the enterprise of such characters. Have it understood that $50 to $75 per month 
were to be paid to those who would fill in so many days in a schoolhouse, and 
that no evidence of moral character, and no certificate as to mental qualifications 
from those capable of judging, and no reports of the manner in which they had 
discharged their duties were to be required, and you will have not the merely 
indifferent teachers and respectable and moral persons now so much complained 
of, but every ignorant neighborhood, from the seaboard to the mountains, infested 
and overrun by plausible, worthless, and dangerous characters, setting on foot 
all sorts of intrigues, imposing on the credulity of the simple-minded, and even 
coneBir ine: with local speculators to obtain and divide with them the tempting 
spoils, 
Normal schools were needed, but they were rather the result than the cause of 
an advanced state of education. Teachers were to be examined yearly. This 
was found to be a hard rule to enforce, but the examining committees were 
steadily supported by the superintendent, and as refractory teachers saw that the
-P-A-G-E-311
COMMON SCHOOLS OF NORTH CAROLINA. 1439 
officers supported each other, they were glad to give in and pass the examinations. 
Further, the schools were beginning to command the sympathy and respect of 
other branches of education: 
“ Professors in colleges, male and female, reposing a confidence for which I am 
grateful, have tried to strengthen my hands, and I have felt proud of the fact that 
since my term of office began common schools have enlisted interest and received 
respect in every male college and nearly every female one in the State, and from 
the conventions of both political parties.” 
Another means of improvement recommended to teachers was the formation of 
teachers’ library associations. 
«Every trade and profession should be learning by experience; but how many 
teachers in North Carolina have read one single book giving an account of the 
experience and improvements in their profession in other places? . . . The legis- 
lature should pass a general act of incorporation, giving corporate existence and 
privileges on certain conditions to the chairman of the board of county superin- 
tendents, and the teachers of each county and committees of examination; and an 
appropriation of $1 or more for each school district . . . should be made fora 
foundation. Let the chairman be librarian, with a certain remuneration, and let 
each teacher pay 50 cents, more or less, annually, for the privilege of membership. 
The superintendent can furnish or recommend a list of books, in conjunction with 
the chairman; and each teacher who joins should have the fact stated on his cer- 
tificate. .. . These associations will increase in consequence; they will form 
meeting places for teachers to assemble and discuss the affairs of education, and 
furnish proper places for lectures by superintendents and others; besides, when 
the minds of teachers are thus brought in contact, the superior intellects will dif- 
fuse themselves and be reflected in the action of all the teachers in the association.” 
In an appendix to this report Dr. Wiley emphasizes still more the necessity of 
organizing, throughout the State, teachers’ library associations. 
“With such an organization the following effects may be confidently antici- 
pated: The first appropriation, small as it is, would buy a sufficient number of 
copies of Page’s work on teaching, Northend’s, or any other, for all the teachers in 
the county. Some four or five works on such subjects might be selected and 
enough of each purchased to have one book, at the least, for every member. And 
if only one-third of the common-school teachers of North Carolina could be 
“induced to read the most indifferent work on teaching, what a vast change would 
soon be perceptible! ... Scatter judiciously over the State good copies of any 
good work on teaching and it will create a revolution. Hitherto we have never 
seen or heard of any other plan than the old provincial one, with no blackboard, 
no oral instruction, no lectures, no inducement to study but the whip, no evidence 
of proficiency but the sum stated on the slate, without a word as to how it was 
arrived at, no admitted indications of industry but aloud babel of sounds, etc. 
Teachers have no fixed plans for their own improvement—none for the scholars. 
The only labor is to fill out the time; the only object to get the public money.” 
Other objects to be secured by the teachers’ library associations were the insuring 
anactive person as the head of the examining committee and insuring a committee. 
Further than this, a communion of feeling and ideas would be effected among the 
teachers: 
«“«They will have something to distinguish them as a class—a common bond of 
union, a place to meet and exchange thoughts. ... Teachers will feel themselves 
enhanced in public estimation, and they will have a body, a society, to defend, to 
promote, toimproye; and by all efforts to elevate their society and make it respected 
they will be individually benefited.” 
These library associations would also furnish vital mediums through which to 
effect the interest. and progress of common schools and enlist the aid of public- 
spirited and philanthropic citizens. The views of the superintendent on these and 
similar lines are reenforced by extracts from the reports of State superintendents 
and others. 
Another vital point demanding constant care and attention was the discipline in 
the schools. ‘‘How often do I hear the complaint that teachers consider that they 
have to fill out merely a certain number of days, and make it their greatest object
-P-A-G-E-312
  1440 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
to kill time instead of improving it.” It was charged that bad habits were not 
forgotten and no good ones acquired; parents were put to expense and children 
put back by a constant change of books, while no efforts were made to classify the 
children, ‘‘and a school of fifty scholars will have forty classes, each class thus 
having but a very few minutes to recite in and the teacher no time for lectures, 
explanations, or oral instructions. Seven hours are enough for school hours in 
the twenty-four; and ten recitations, fifteen atthe furthest, are as many as can be 
well made and heard in seven hours, except recitations by those learning their 
letters, Oral instruction is coming more and more in vogue.” Dr. Wiley then 
recounts his efforts to bring about a proper classification of the children: 
«“T determined, if possible, to make arrangements to have the children classified, 
and to get into use one uniform system of good books, to insure this end of classi- 
fying the pupils, to save cost, to have good sources of instruction in the schools, 
and to have the young mind of the State in its plastic condition learning about 
North Carolina and learning to love the State and to take an interest in its insti- 
tutions. This of itself would make a great revolution in time. How could we feel 
an abiding interest in the common schools, or in any other institution of the State, 
when under the old way of doing things we were educated to love and respect 
every other country and the affairs of every other country more than our own?” 
Of his own duties he says: 
“The head of the common-school system ought to study; like the leader of an 
army, he ought to have the whole field before him and to initiate every gen- 
eral movement with great care. He ought to study other systems as well as our 
own; he needs a previous preparation just as much as a lawyer, engineer, or 
physician. ... Knowing that States never do things as well or carefully as 
individuals or private companies, I have endeavored to prepare myself in the midst 
of the duties of the office. Ihave read and written on the road, and procured and 
studied all the lights I could, and, as I could catch time, endeavored to look over 
our whole system and examine it in its details and in its general bearings.” 
Of the need and importance of teachers’ institutes he says: 
«When traveling, to acquaint myself with the character of the State, I often 
undertook to deliver lectures, and I was of opinion that many who heard me began 
to feel a new interest in the cause. But many of our so-called intelligent people 
would not attend, looking on the whole common-school machinery as not intended 
for them; and they, whom they called the common people, had no excitement to 
draw them out, no example of interest set by others, while teachers, afraid, no 
doubt, of exposing themselves in some way, rarely ever attended. Hence, speech 
making in North Carolina was not calculated much to advance the cause.” 
Then, mindful of the criticisms which came pouring in on him and of the polit- 
ical sword suspended always above his head, he modestly says of his own work: 
“T was conscious that more was expected of me than could be accomplished by 
mortal man, in the time, with even more means at his disposal—that I was, in 
fact, expected to do in two short years, with none to help and all to criticise, what 
legislators and officers and people, by cheerful cooperation and patient effort, 
with full confidence in each other and every disposition to strengthen the hands 
of each other, ought to be proud to be able to accomplish in ten or twenty years, 
and what it had taken such efforts much longer time to effect in other places. I 
felt, too—not a pleasant reflection to a sensitive mind—that while I was spending 
freely in books, in postage, in travels, and neglecting more profitable sources of 
revenue, and not saving much of my salary, some were thinking I was growing 
rich on the public money and robbing the schools, which had lost many thou- 
sands for the want of a more efficient organization and which contributed to my 
salary about 50 cents each, or in the ratio of three-quarters of 1 cent to the child, 
while I was trying to save twenty times that amount to each on the single small 
item of books alone. ... I will be excused for saying, in conclusion, that the 
subject is the most important one which can possibly come before our legislature, 
and that in common schools the people are infinitely more interested than in all 
the other literary institutions of the country.” 
The year 1855 opened with a revisal and reenactment of the school law. There 
had been much opposition to the new system developed. There had been rumors 
that the law of 1852 was to be repealed and a return to the old decentralized,
-P-A-G-E-313
es SERS re ne a ee ee ae 
COMMON SCHOOLS OF NORTH CAROLINA. 1441 
do-nothing system inaugurated—a ‘‘system of nominal supervision and actual 
indifference.” But these fears were groundless. The return to the old system 
was not inaugurated, and Dr, Wiley was reelected to the place of superintendent 
without opposition and by political opponents. 
There is a vein of hope and encouragement in the third annual report for the 
year ending December 31, 1855. 
Before noticing the report it may be well to consider the new law: The act rati- 
fied February 10, 1855, defined the sources of revenue of the literary fund, directed 
the management of the swamp lands, and regulated the common schools. Under 
the act the distribution was to be on the basis of Federal population as it had been 
under the earlier law, the appointment of a general superintendent was renewed, 
and each county was to have not more than ten nor less than five local superin- 3 
tendents or committeemen. The chairman of these superintendents was to give 
bond, and his compensation was 23 per cent; the counties were to levy a tax not 
less in amount than one-half of the estimated amount to be received from the lit- 
erary fund. In addition to these, three school committeemen were to be chosen 
annually by popular vote. These two boards wereto have the controi of the schools 
and tomake reports to the State superintendent. The efforts of the superintendent 
were directed largely to introducing new ideas, to improving the quality of the 
teachers, and tosecuring punctuality and faithfulness in the disbursement of money. 
Only in two cases did the failure to report on the use of money indicate its 
misapplication, and one of these was taken into the courts more as a matter of 
warning to others than with the idea of prosecution. A more general knowledge 
of the school law and of its objects and a stricter attention to its requirements 
was needed. Dr. Wiley desired to secure good examining committees by provid- 
ing for the payment of their expenses, but in this he failed. He wished also to 
organize the teachers into associations. One of the matiers that attracted the 
attention of the superintendent continually and enlisted his best efforts was the 
desire to spread throughout the State a more general knowledge of its history and 
resources and correct false impressions. The common-school class ‘imbibed 
their first ideas from books, in which North Carolina, whenever it was necessary 
to mention the State, was represented in such a way as to make impressions any- 
thing else but pleasant to young imaginations.” On the misrepresentations and 
manifest injustice to the State Dr. Wiley rings the changes time and time again. 
It was against such ideas as these that he had prepared his reader and the North 
Carolina edition of Mitchell’s Geography, and so persistent and enthusiastic was 
he that before the war began his reader had been adopted in most of the schools 
of the State, and there was more knowledge of the State and a better appreciation. 
of its resources than at any previous time. He was also busily engaged during 
this year in superintending the making of the first and second numbers of his 
readers. 
“Tn a short time our whole school literature will be changed—a new spirit will 
breathe from the pages where our children get their first and most lasting impres- 
sions, and it is impossible not to foresee from this a great and thorough revolution 
in public sentiment and feeling, producing a more homogeneous and public- 
spirited population, inspiring respect for the common schools as a great hope of a 
growing and prosperous Commonwealth and reflected in fact in all our industrial, 
social, and educational characteristics.” 
He repeats his suggestions in favor of teachers’ library associations which he had 
previously made, and emphasizes their importance in fostering the growth of 
knowledge of methods of teaching and of the history of the schools of the State- 
That this knowledge was necessary is evident from the fact that while the Ameri- 
can Almanac, published in Boston, had some mention of common schools in North 
Carolina, there was none in either of the two leading almanacs published in the 
State.

But while there were defects and weaknesses, the report for the year as a whole’ 
was satisfactory. The reports from the counties, while not complete, were more 
complete than they had been in any previous year. There were then about 9,000 
pupils in academies and about 1,000 in colleges. The male colleges numbered 5, 
the female 9, the academies about 300, and the common schools about 3,500. The 
* whole number of counties was 85; the whole number of districts in 75 counties 
reporting was 2,995; the whole number of schools taught in 71 counties, 1,905; 
whole number of children in 70 counties, 189,562; whole number attending schools 
in 73 counties, 112,632, and those in counties not reporting would have probably 
swelled the number to 130,000. The number of teachers licensed in 57 counties 
was 1,369; the average length of the school term was about four months; the 
salaries ranged from $10 to $13 in Watauga County and $11 to $15 in Madison 
to from $25 to $40 in Carteret and New Hanover. According to the observations 
of the superintendent, ‘In all essential points the common-school system of North 
Carolina has undergone an entire and quiet revolution in the last three years.” 
Reports had improved, salaries had improved, and ‘our social condition more 
than that of apparently better favored regions has helped to foster this system 
of schools, and our masses, nearly all of them being of the middle class, are becom- 
ing molded into a homogeneous population, intelligent, eminently republican, 
sober, calculating, moral, and conservative.” 
The report of the superintendent for 1856, coming within less than a year after 
that for 1855, is more like a special report. In this report the chief matters dis- 
cussed are the publication of the school journal and the organization of a State 
Teachers’ Association. Thesesubjects are treated at length later (see p. 1447). In 
his annual letter to the county superintendents, whose duty it was to examire 
teachers, he notes the progress that had been made in the teachers in the last five 
years. Then there were perhaps two hundred teachers who held certificates of 
character and qualifications from examining committees,and these were for an 
indefinite period. In 1856 there were 2,000 such teachers, all under the spur of 
annual examinations— 
“and of these, a considerable proportion are continually improving, while some 
of the old incorrigible nuisances are each year cut off and their connection with 
our educational system severed forever. ‘These are great facts; they show that 
while we are getting rid of bad material we are supplying its place with that 
which is better, while of those who still continue to teach an important number 
are improving. ... It is right to be predisposed in favor of those who have 
stood high heretofore; but ever remember that while the teacher may depreciate 
in morals and in intelligence, and thus lose his relative position, he may also lose 
it by the increasing knowledge of the community. A high standard of qualifica- 
tion five years ago is not a high standard now; and, therefore, let me urge on you 
the importance of granting no certificates without actual examinations. These 
examinations are not a thorough test, but they are a spur to candidates, and cause 
pany. of them to be constantly endeavoring to improve, and that is the great 
point. 
Dr. Wiley urges repeatedly that mental qualifications should never be substi- 
tuted for ‘‘unimpeachable integrity and moral character.” 
The fifth annual report was for the year 1857-58, but was made to the assembly 
of 1858-59. It notes satisfactory progress throughout the whole of the State, but 
there were still many things that needed attention and improvement. The super- 
intendent notes that at that time the number of schools taught in any one year 
was not in itself an indication of increasing or failing energies in the system, for 
many districts preferred to have a long term once in two years than a short term 
each year. A considerable number of schoolhouses had been closed for temporary 
reasons—some for repairs, others to be rebuilt or removed to a more convenient 
location. ‘‘ Notwithstanding the hardness of the times, there is quite a spirit of 
improvement of this kind, and in some places the schools have been stopped that 
the districts may be laid off on a better plan.” The estimated value of school-

houses and lots was $350,000, The sum expended in the 76 counties reporting was 
$226,238.49; the sum expended in the whole State was probably $253,000. The 
sum left over in the hands of chairmen in 76 counties was $157,519.60, or perhaps 
$175,000 for the whole State. The number of certificates to teach granted and 
reported was 2,256, which included 214 women teachers or more. There were 
perhaps 2,500 teachers licensed in all. There were perhaps not fifty who taught 
without license, while a few years before not one in forty had been licensed. At 
least three-fourths of all the teachers taught grammar and geography. while, 
fifteen years before this time these subjects were not taught in one-fifth of the 
schools. Tho average length of the school was four months; the average attend- 
ance was 40 pupils, and the average salary about $24 per month, varying in 
different locations and at different seasons from $15 to $40. The average amount 
expended on each pupil was $1.66}, while the average cost to each parent for all 
tho expenditures of the common schools was about 663; cents per annum. The 
entire cost of administering the school fund, including expenses of every sort 
other than teachers’ salaries, was less than $13,000. This meant that about 95 per 
cent of the entire fund was paid to teachers. 
For the year ending with September, 1857, the whole number of districts 
reported was 3,190, of which 2,516 were taught. The number of male children in 
these counties between 5 and 21 was reported as 91,938, the females 81,134; the 
boys attending school were 55,477, the girls 42,167. 
The chairman of the board of county superintendents was now becoming of 
more importance and value than he had been in the past. He was now something 
more than an honest man and a good financier: 
“ These officers and the committees of examination manifest a much more enlight- 
ened sense of the spirit of their obligations, and very generally the regulations 
for the improvement of teachers and for enhancing the usefulness of chairmen 
are better understood and better appreciated. The capacity of the system for 
great and continued improvement is settled beyond dispute; the good already done 
is known and more properly estimated. Insufficient local officers are now much 
less likely to escape an awakened public attention, and a healthy and vigorous 
public opinion is bringing to light the defalcations and abuses of those who once 
freely speculated on the public funds. ... There are now, comparatively speak- 
ing, no frontiers, no colonies, no obscure territories in which such persons can take 
refuge and be a jaw unto themselves.” 
These sentences indicate practices which had grown up in many quarters. 
Chairmen were required to give bond for the moneys passing through their hands, 
but in many counties they were allowed to hold over from year to year without 
renewing their bonds, which not only produced vexatious law suits, but in some 
cases actual loss to the schools. The legislature finally declared that the bond of 
a chairman was good against him and his sureties as long as he continued in office 
under the bond and until he settled his accounts with his successor, or gave a new 
bond. They were also required to renew the bond annually. 
Dr. Wiley reviews the prospect of the future with hope and encouragement: 
“A united people, a healthy and vigorous public sentiment, a vast educational 
combination, animated with one impulse and guided by fixed, uniform, and gen- 
eral principles, and all operating to one end, the improvement of our common 
schools. ... Every unimproving and unimprovable teacher in the State will be 
cut off after one year’s trial; and none will be licensed for one year without prov- 
ing a good moral character and showing respectable mental attainments. The 
entire corps of teachers will be organized into disciplined bodies, the members 
losing their isolation and feeling themselves to be parts of a great system, learn- 
ing ideas from each other, zealous of the reputation of their order, and feeling that 
they are acting in the light of a public opinion from whose scrutiny they can not 
escape.” 
A plan for a series of district normal schools was proposed, which were to be 
inexpensive and were intended primarily for femate teachers.

1444 E EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
The success of the common-school system of North Carolina had been so marked 
that it was attracting general attention abroad: 
“Three of the most distinguished States of the South, and long considered our 
superiors in many things, are not ashamed to look to us for light and information 
on this important subject. Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia are disposed to 
copy our example; many leading citizens in each of these noble Commonwealths 
openly acknowledge our superiority in educational facilities and point to our 
course as worthy of imitation.... Perhaps no State in the South has so 
respectable an educational system as North Carolina; and surely this is saying 
much for a State which was once behind all her sisters.” 
It was estimated that the schools brought into the State not less than $250,000 
annually. This was due largely to the prominent position which the University 
of North Carolina then occupied among Southern colleges. During the year 
1858-59, out of 456 students in the institution 39 were from Tennessee; Louisiana 
had 28; Mississippi, 26; Alabama, 21; South Carolina, 15; Texas, 15; Georgia, 14; 
Virginia, 8; Kentucky, 4; Florida, 4; Arkansas, 2; Iowa, 1; New York, 1. 
A matter which gave the school authorities much trouble was the distribution 
of the schoolfund. It produced hardship in the large districts if the same amount 
was given to each and in the small ones if the division was made on the basis of 
numbers. The solution arrived at was that the districts should be so arranged 
that there should be only one school in each, and where it was necessary to have 
a very small district this was considered as having’an average number of children. 
Wherever this plan was adopted it gave satisfaction and put an end to disputes. 
Another matter that gave considerable d ssatisfaction, but which continued to be 
the plan of administration, was the distribution of the school fund on the basis of 
Federal rather than white population. 
The report for 1858 indicates that the progress of the schools as a whole was 
favorable. It opens, however, with the characteristic and necessary complaint 
that some of the counties were slow in making their returns, and that therefore 
the reports were necessarily imperfect. There was in this, as in earlier reports, a 
manifest and laborious effort to figureignorance out of existence. Still, the progress 
of the schools was very favorable. The sums reported as in the hands of chair- 
men of 71 counties (out of 85) during the year was $371,320.07; the disbursements 
were $221,132.50, leaving a balance on hand of $152,178.87, a part of which was to 
be paid out soon for schools still insession. The number of districts reported was 
8,237; number of schools taught, 2,602; boys reported, 82,642; in school, 57,700; 
girls reported, 74,582; in school, 44,587;' average length of school term, 3.7 
months; averagesalary, $23.62; teachers licensed, 1,994, of whom 205 were women. 
The hopeful manifestations of progress were an evidently increasing sense of 
responsibility on the part of subordinate officers; more energetic and enlightened 
action on the part of boards of county superintendents; the general, gradual, but 
certain elevation of the standard of teachers’ qualifications; obvious influences for 
good among all classes and in various places, caused by unceasing efforts to dis- 
seminate useful information and statistics; the successful formation of associa- 
tions intended to combine the exertions of the friends of all classes of general 
education; the general disappearance of prejudice and the difficulties arising from 
prejudice and ignorance, and an increasing animation and hopefulness on the 
part of friends in every part of the State (p. 18). 
Chairmen of boards of county superintendents took more pains as a general 
tule, and acted more on system, and there was less opportunity for malfeasance in 
office, and temptation to careless handling of money was cut off; maps of the 
counties and of the districts were prepared, and more visits were made to the 
schools. 
A new school register was printed and sent out in course of the year. ‘‘Its   
  
1 Corrected returns show that the whole number of boys and girls taught in 1858 was 115,855.

COMMON SCHOOLS OF NORTH CAROLINA. 1445 
advantages as a history of our schools are obvious, while it will be a material aid 
to the teacher in preserving order and in stimulating the industry of the pupils, 
who will not fail to remember that their actions and progress are being recorded.” 
The idea of school libraries was emphasized and a proposition made to erect 
teachers’ halls in each county. The want of convenient and comfortable places 
of meeting had been a drawback on the usefulness of the examining committees. 
‘These halls would in time be filled with libraries for the use of teachers and 
common-school officers, and they would furnish tempting inducements for the 
formation of teachers’ associations. They would furnish points of contact and 
intercommunication for the teachers of each county, thus tending to destroy that 
isolation and indifference to the opinion of others so much in the way of their 
improvement and so repressive of a proper public spirit and interest in their call- 
ing; and here also the friends of the cause could and would have opportunities of 
meeting the teachers and officers, and would, from time to time, have courses of 
lectures delivered for their especial benefit. These halls and their purposes would 
be standing appeals to the patriotic, the benevolent, and public-spirited—and 
natives of the county, prospering in business in distant States and countries, Mem- 
bers of Congress, and public bodies would make donations of books, documents, 
maps, reports, periodicals, and minerals. They would be external signs of the 
progress of a moral cause, improving the senses and exciting the patriotic pride 
and generous emulation—considerations not to be neglected by the friends of com- 
mon schools. The State would also doubtless contribute public documents, and 
these halls would in time become, next to the churches and court-houses, the most 
useful and indispensable public buildings of the several counties,”       
   
As to the schools in general, Dr. Wiley is very modest: 
“The common schools of the State make little show in the world. The houses 
are generally plain, the teachers modest and unpretending, and a vast majority of 
the officers are the hard-working and simple-minded yeomanry of the country. 
Even the chief executive head of the system has no office in the capitol, and there 
is not connected with any of the operations of the schools any of those pompous 
externals which command the respect and admiration of the valgar-minded. But 
like every great cause, this one is striking its roots into the hearts and minds of 
the masses of the common people, and the philosopher can easily see that here is 
the nursery of power and dominion.” 
The reports for 1859 and 1860 were both made to the assembly of 1860-61, although 
printed and published separately. They begin with the usual complaint at the 
vice of tardiness which had characterized the local school officers from the begin- 
ning; but notwithstanding such defects, the progress of the schools was satisfac- 
tory. Returns had been made by 81 of the counties, but many of them were 
defective in one respect or another. The labor of educating the local officials up 
to the knowledge of the importance of full, accurate, and early returns was great. 
In the leading facts the reports for 1859 and 1860 differed only in degree, not in 
kind, from those for other years. Several of the counties were redistricted by 
actual surveys and in some cases the schools had been closed temporarily. The 
disposition to build new and better houses was on the increase. The salaries 
reached the maximum of the ante-bellum period in 1859, being $28 on an average, 
but feli in 1860 to $26. The receipts of school money was $379,842.64} in 1859 and 
! the disbursements $235,410.574, against $408,566.32 received and $255,641.12 dis- 
pursed in 1860. As has been stated already, the sums reported as remaining in 
hand were liable to be paid out in part for schools in operation at the time of the 
report but not yet finished.. A new phase of the report appears in 1859 for the 
first time with the reports from the various counties of the amount of school taxes 
collected during the year. This was done in accord with an act passed in 1858-59. 
Imperfect reports for the year ending September, 1859, show that in 59 counties 
$73,160 had been collected. The largest amount collected in any one county was 
$3,905.04 in Guilford; Mecklenburg came next with $3,449.98, In 1860 the amount 
in 65 counties was $75,929.8, making an average of $1,168.02 to the county. This 
average would have made for the State taxes amounting to $100,449.72, The

districts as reported in 1859 were 3,373; in 1860, 3,488; schools taught, 1859, 2,758; 
in 1860, 2,854; boys reported in 1859, 93,494; in school, 61,496; boys reported in 1860, 
96,926; in school, 59,496; girls reported in 1859, 86,878; in school, 47,442; girls 
reported in 1860, 88,637; in school, 45,558; teachers licensed, 1859, 1,843; women, 
156; teachers licensed in 1860, 2,164; women, 315. There was in these, as in former 
reports, a strenuous effort to figure ignorance out of the State, with the same lack 
of success. It was always impossible to get Dr. Wiley’s actual figures up to his 
estimates. ' 
Nearly all of the teachers were compelled to undergo annual examinations, and 
these were becoming more rigid from year to year. The numberof women teach- 
ers was increasing, and there was not as much disparity betweeu their wages and 
those of men as in other States, 
“Nor should there be, for females make much the best teachers of primary schools, 
and it is sincerely to be hoped that the pecuniary inducements to engage them in 
the most honorable calling of teaching, as well as the great need of their services 
and the good to be accomplished by them, will soon enlist a much larger number 
in this cause. At present the proportion of female teachers is not greater than 
one in twelve of the whole number, and it ought to be at least one-half.” 
There is less emphasis in these later reports on the series of North Carolina 
readers and on the North Carolina edition of Mitchell’s Geography, the probable 
reason being that these had been introduced already and had secured a firm foot- 
hold. But the subject of a uniformity of text-books is discussed with consider- 
able fullness in the report for 1859. Dr. Wiley confessed that ‘the nuisance aris- 
ing from the diversity and bad character of text-books is yet far from being 
removed,” but still he argued against putting absolute power over this matter 
into the hands of the school authorities or in those of the superintendent. This 
subject makes him forget his true position and leads him off into a discussion of 
the great political topic of the day and its relations to the education of the ruling 
race, which is renewed in even more vigorous language in the report for 1860. 
In his eighth letter of suggestions and instructions the superintendent discusses 
tho growing need of a graded system, and in 1859 the educational association 
appointed a committee to investigate the matter. Tho disadvantage of the system 
in use lay in the fact that it was horizontal, furnishing but one grade of education 
for all, and thus meeting only the demand for an elementary education. 
“This first and chief necessity being overcome, we now want schools that will 
enable all classes to obtain such a practical-or business education as they may 
desire. . . . If we had remained without common schools, we never would have 
needed a general system of graded schools, all kinds of education remaining at a 
verylowpoint. But by furnishing the elements of knowledge to all, a great many 
naturally want more light; and therefore, if we would have graded schools to suit 
all, we must build on the common-school system, and never for a moment think 
of abolishing it. To abolish it is to take away all foundation for graded schools, 
or for any general system. It has now laid a broad and durable basis for graded 
schools; and let us build all our hopes of improvement on this. .. . The first and 
chief point, then, to which I would direct your attention in this letter is this, to 
wit: To keep before you the fact that graded schools are becoming more and more 
necessary to supply the primary educational wants of the community. . . . Until 
the popular mind is better prepared for such things it would be unprofitable and 
very troublesome to undertake, generally, to establish graded schools; and still 
there are increasing wants which point to such a system as a coming necessity.” 
He urges, therefore, that at least one thoroughly qualified teacher should be 
secured for each school, and that no certificate should be granted to “any other 
class, unless it be to females who will teach summer schools composed of the 
smaller children.” 
Of the general success of the system in 1860 he says: 
“The educational system of North Carolina is now attracting the favorable 
  
1According to the census of 1860 the total school tax of North Carolina for the year ending 
June 1, 1860, was $94,731 and the total school attendance, 116,567.

attention of the States south, west, and north of us... . All modern statistical 
publications give us a rank far in advance of the position which we occupied in 
such works a few years ago; and without referring to numerous other facts equally 
significant, our moral influence may be illustrated by the fact that the superin- 
tendent of common schools was pressingly invited to visit, free of expense, the 
legislature of the most powerfal State south of us [Georgia], to aid in preparing 
a system of public instruction similar to ours. © receives constant inquiries 
from abroad in regard to our plan; and beyond all doubt our schools, including 
those of all grades, are now the greatest temporal interest of the State... . North 
Carolina has the start of all her Southern sisters in educational matters... . 
If, then, she is true to herself, and justly comprehends the plain logic of the 
facts of her situation, she will now ... prudently and courageously advance in 
the direction which leads alike to safety, to peace, and to prosperity. ... Such 
action is not merely important as likely to lead to future greatness; it is also a 
defensive and imperative necessity of the present. If the Union remains, no one 
will deny the importance, to our peace as well as honor, of having a strong and 
prosperous State, able to command the respect of her confederates; if the Union 
is dissolved, then North Carolina is our only country for the present, and our 
present security and future hopes will depend on her power to stand alone or 
honorably to compete with rivals in a new confederacy.” 
In 1860-61 the assembly passed an act modifying the method of choosing district 
committeemen, by which, while the election was put into the hands of the county 
superintendents, the people were given the power by means of petition to dictate 
the parties to be elected. Provisions were renewed by which copies of the North 
Carolina Educational Journal were to be sent to all school officers and paid for 
out of the school fund. The State Teachers’ Association was chartered and given 
a small appropriation, and a plan for a teachers’ or normal school was unani- 
mously recommended by this association in November, 1860. The main features 
of this proposed plan were ‘‘that it springs as a natural, upward growth from the 
common-school system, and is not a foreign idea ingrafted on it; it will not bea 
burden to the State or literary fund; it allows the people of the several counties 
to act on their own discretion when ready to act; it does not require all the coun- 
ties to act together, but permits such as are ready for it to adopt the plan, others 
to follow when they choose.” 
This scheme had two defects. It was permissive, and it expected good schools 
at an insignificant outlay of money. It was bitterly attacked in the newspapers, 
and it was claimed that at each session of the legislature this or some similar 
scheme was gotten up to “ throw dust into the eyes of the members” and get the 
superintendent reelected. It was said that $10,000 had been wasted on one normal 
school already. The proposed scheme came to naught. This was not an unusual 
attack, for the success the system had attained under great difficulties had not 
saved it; but as an offset we may quote the reports from Granville County that 
the healthfulness of the system was being manifest in the building of new school- 
houses of brick and stone, and from Chowan County, where the system was mak- 
ing itself felt in more intelligent jurors. 
THE NORTH CAROLINA JOURNAL OF EDUCATION. 
There were during the period of ‘‘reorganization and growth” two auxiliary 
agencies in the work of the schools, which were of so much importance and value 
that they are, perhaps, worthy of a separate treatment. These agencies, which 
began before the close of the period to take on an official character, were the North 
Carolina Journal of Education and the Educational Association of North Carolina, 
As early as 1849 Nereus Mendenhall, a Quaker teacher of Guilford County, issued 
proposals for the publication of a small monthly, at 50 cents a year. It was to be 
issued from Greensboro, was to be devoted to education, and especially to the com- 
mon schools. We do not know of its success. It was probably never published, 
In his first efforts in this direction Dr. Wiley proposed to edit a monthly news- 
paper, give it an educational turn, and send it free to all school authorities. This 
scheme was a failure. 
 
-P-A-G-E-320
  1448 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
In the report for 1855 he outlines another plan for an educational journal. In 
fact, he may be looked on as playing a threefold part. In his chief réle he was 
State superintendent of public instruction. In subordinate capacities he was 
director of the Educational Association of North Carolina and editor of the North 
Carolina Journal of Education. 
In the plan outlined in 1855, Dr. Wiley says he had found that speeches, although 
delivered in every county, had little effect; the laws were read by few, even; of the 
school officers; no one newspaper reached the people generally, and it seemed to 
him that a periodical, sent free to the districts, would be the best means of accom- 
plishing this end, : 
““The periodical should contain, in standing type, the law in relation to the 
duties of district committees—forms for the reports they are required to make, 
explanations, and useful suggestions connected with these. In addition to this, 
there might be short editorials in a familiar style on the subject of education, 
sketches of common schools in other States and countries, facts and incidents 
in our own experience, correspondence of teachers and officers of the system 
and of the friends of education, instructions of the general superintendent, 
notices of schools, of the want of teachers in particular places, of teachers out of 
employment, ete., with a record of the current news, especially in its relation to 
education and improvements.” 
He reports that he will be able, ‘‘ without asking the aid of the State or taxing 
i idual liberality,” to publish such a journal monthly and circulate 3,500 copies 
among the school officers of the State. The plan thus outlined took shape with 
the issue of the North Carolina Common School Journal in September, 1856. It 
was published quarterly from Greensboro and Raleigh, 82 pages, octavo. The 
Journal follows the general outline laid down for it in the report. It is made up 
largely of extracts from that document, and nearly the whole was from the pen of 
Dr. Wiley. The expense of the publication was borne by the firms of G. & C. 
Merriam and A. S. Barnes & Co., whose books had been recommended for the 
North Carolina schools, and their advertisements alone appear in its pages. They 
declined to invest more money in it after the publication of the second number. 
Its publication was continued, however, for one year, when it was forced to sus- 
pend, after having entailed on the superintendent a loss of several hundred dollars 
besides the extra labor. 
But the project was not allowed to sleep. In the meantime the Educational 
Association of North Carolina had been organized, and found it necessary to have 
an organ of communication. At the first annual meeting of the association, held 
in Warrenton in July, 1857, the matter was discussed and referred to a committee, 
who reported to the association ‘‘that the president of the association appoint a 
committee of five, whose duty it shall be to take all necessary steps for the per- 
manent establishment of a monthly journal for the promotion of the general edu- 
cational interests of North Carolina. That as members of this association we will 
use every effort to secure the success of the enterprise, and recommend it to the 
favorable consideration of the friends of edueation throughout the State.” 
This report was adopted, and the committee appointed consisted of Dr. Wiley, 
as chairman, George W. Brooks, C. C. Cole, W. W. Holden, and William Robin- 
son, Under these auspices the first number of the North Carolina Journal of 
Education was issued in January, 1858, from the Times office, in Greensboro. The 
editor in chief was Dr. Wiley; the resident and managing editor was J. D. Camp- 
bell, and he alone received pay for his work. Wiley and Campbell were assisted 
by a board of fourteen others, who represented all sections of the State, including 
the college and private school interests. The volume for 1858 consisted of 390 
double-column octave pages. It seems to have been liberally supported by 
advertisers. 
“The general object of this and of all similar enterprises is the promotion of 
education among the people,” says Dr. Wiley in his editorial introduction. “‘Itis

to be the special object of the Journal to be an instrument of good to the common 
schools in North Carolina; and much of its matter, both of facts and statistics 
and also of discussion and suggestion, is intended to bear on this paramount sub- 
ject. The general character of the contents of the Journal may therefore be 
easily inferred. They are to be practical; they are to be plain; . . . they are tobe 
pointed, and to relate exclusively to the cause of education in ‘some one of its 
countless phases. Experience in the schoolroom, experience among trustees and 
committees, discussions as to methods of instruction and of discipline, and sug- 
- gestions as to improvements in the construction of houses and in the method of 
furnishing and warming them; books, amusements, and studies, plans for increas- 
ing the public interest in education and for the improvement of teachers, duties 
of teachers, parents, school officers, of the people and of their public servants, 
objects in legislation, facts, abuses, good examples, history, biography, moral 
instruction, etc., are all subjects which ought to be treated of in the Journal. 
The style should be plain—not inelegant, but simple; the illustrations, practical 
and to the point. There should be as little as possible of elaborate discussion of 
abstract principles, and nothing published merely to display ability or taste in 
composition.” 
The Journal is made up from the contributions of the various editors, from 
college professors, and other teachers throughout the State. There are many 
extracts from the report of the State superintendent; reports of the State Educational 
Association were made prominent, and everything possible was done to advance 
the cause of education, 
Dr, Wiley found it necessary to urge constantly in his reports the i importance of 
the Journal. This was due largely to the fact that while it commanded respect 
among similar journals in other parts of the Union, its list of subscribers was 
small. In the course of time the law was so altered that the counties might sub- 
scribe from the school fund for copies for the use of its school authorities, and in 
1860-61 the superintendent was authorized to subscribe for copies for each of the 
county school authorities and for each common-school district. The influence of 
this step on the tone of the teachers of the State was very great. It was continued 
through the year 1863, but the pressure from increased prices, the failure of sub- 
scribers, and the inability to get paper compelled the editor to cut down the size 
and to publish it bimonthly instead of monthly. The last number seen is that for 
March, 1864, 
It is remarkable that it had held out so long, for as early as 1862 it complained 
that at least one-half of its exchanges had been compelled to suspend publication, 
and time and again it was delayed by the impossibility of getting paper. The 
establishment of Campbell & Albright, who printed the Journal, was destroyed 
in March, 1868, and this loss, coupled with other difficulties, was probably one of 
the troubles from which it could'not recover. The managing editor did not long 
survive the Journal. Mr. Campbell died about September, 1865. There has been 
no educational journal in North Carolina since that time of equal value. 
THE EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF NORTH CAROLINA. 
An educational association was organized in Guilford County in 1849.1 Women 
  
1In 1822 the “Education Society of North Carolina” was organized in Hillsboro “to aid indi- 
gent and pious young men in acquiring an education for the gospel ministry.” The fee for 
membership was $10. Rev. Joseph Caldwell was president; Joseph B. Littlejohn, Martin Ross, 
Duncan Cameron, and Rey. J. M. Wilson were vice-presidents; Dr. James Webb, treasurer; 
§. K. Kollock, corresponding secretary, and Benjamin 8. King, recording secretary. The Pea- 
cock Library, of Greensboro, N. C., has two copies of its constitution, one of them as follows:

Another copy, with board of directors and address to people of North Carolina, was printed 
by Gales in Raleigh in 1822. [8vo., pp.8.] See also Barnard’s Journal, XVI, pp. 361-363, for men- 
tion of the ‘“ North Carolina Institute of Education,” organized by Dr. Joseph Caldwell in Jan- 
uary, 1831. A second meeting was held in January, 1832, at which papers were read by Alfred 
Moore, H. 8. Ellenwood, and Dr. William Hooper.

took part in its proceedings, and its object was to aid the common schools. No 
names are given in the report of this association consulted, but it was in Dr. 
Wiley’s county, and we may be sure that he had a hand in itsorganization. This 
was a local association. 
The Educational Association of North Carolina had its origin in a teachers’ 
convention held in Goldsboro May 7, 1856. The leading spirit on that occasion 
was Dr. Wiley, and the expressed object was ‘‘to bring together both common 
school and classical teachers and unite them in one body, whose interests are 
identical and whose aims should be the same.” A committee was appointed 
to make arrangements for a general convention and to invite proper persons to 
address that gathering on subjects relating to schools. Another committee on 
membership was appointed, and which, from its cosmopolitan character, extended 
from one end of the State to the other. Dr. Wiley by a special address aroused 
the interest and enthusiasm of those present to greater efforts in behalf of the 
schoo!s.! 
Dr. Wiley says of former efforts: 
“Byery attempt heretofore made to get together a respectable educational con- 
vention representing the different sections of the State and its various schools 
proved a total failure. . .. We have been a divided community. As every student 
of our past career and as everyone familiar with scenes in our legislative halls 
well knows, we have seldom been pervaded by one sentiment, sympathy, or sense 
of interest in our State affairs, and this divided and localized feeling has marred 
many schemes intended for the general good and retarded the progress of the 
State in useful improvements. One advantage of the common-school system was 
that it was one interest (unfortunately the only one) which pervaded every 
section.” 
But notwithstanding opposing obstacles a successful meeting was now held, the 
right elements attended, and all barriers to union were broken down. 
“The educational interests of North Carolina were placed in a position to speak 
hereafter with one voice and in all its departmentg, to strike with a thousand 
energetic arms nerved and animated with one heart, one mind, and one hope. 
Tho ultimate result of the course so successfully inaugurated no one can over- 
value; and already several counties are in the field with county affiliated associa- 
tions, whose influence will be exerted directly and most effectually on common- 
school teachers, Three counties have applied for constitutions; and I feel confi- 
dent that if the cause is pushed on vigorously on the plan Iam pursuing in one 
year half the counties in the State will have similar associations.” 
  This preliminary meeting was followed by another meeting at Salisbury on 
October 21, 1856, and the organization was completed at Warrenton July 1, 1857. 
The main features of this meeting were the complete organization of the associa- 
tion by the adoption of a constitution and election of officers; the discussion on 
the needs of and the ways and means for a journal of education, and the address 
of W. W. Holden, editor of the Raleigh Standard, on the history of the common 
schools in North Carolina.? This was the first time that this subject had ever been 
deemed worthy of consideration in a detailed and dignified way. 
Dr. Wiley’s success in organizing a State association was in sharp contrast 
with the efforts made to organize such an association a short while before he 
was elected superintendent. Tho matter was thoroughly advertised, “the day 
arrived, and one delegate attended.” But Wiley’s later success was the result of 
a continued and persistent agitation of the subject, as it had been in the case of 
the Common School Journal and of the North Carolina Journal of Education. He 
sent letters to most of the leading men in the State and asked them to aid in the 
movement for the educational association, and in some cases to prepare papers. 
The number of public men and lawyers who expressed their interest and sym-

pathy was large, while the aid and encouragement from other professional men 
was small. A majority of those who were invited to participate declined for one 
reason and another, but they all commended the idea. The trouble in this con- 
nection was that Wiley was obliged to appeal for support to other than profes- 
sional teachers. This class had not been evolved as yet, or if evolved commanded 
little respect, while those of other professions who were interested in education 
and commanded respect had little or no time to take from their own particular 
employment. 
Tho State Educational Association was tended and nursed in the same careful 
way as the educational journal. These two instruments were considered by Dr. 
Wiley his chief aids in developing and strengthening the common-school system 
of the State. He lost no opportunity to advance their interests or to encourage 
the teachers to become members of the one and to read the pages of the other. 
The association brought ‘‘into council representatives from all classes of our 
schools, from the university down, and including officers and teachers of the com- 
mon schools; and its direct and obvious tendency is to create and foster a more 
catholic spirit among educators, to unite the efforts of the friends of popular intel- 
ligence, to repress hostility between schools of different grades and sections, to 
elevate the standard of teaching, to enliven and widen the.popular interest in 
education.” 
At the annual meeting held in Statesville in 1858! it was found that the organi- 
zation of a central association had stimulated and encouraged the work of the 
local associations, for they were found to be increasing in numbers and improving 
in the character of their work. The principal work of the Statesville session was a 
discussion on the importance and need of normal schools, the claims of the Journal, 
and the need of assistance to the association from the State. It was proposed 
that such moneys as remained uncalled for in the public offices of the State should 
be paid to the association, to be used in preparing young persons as common- 
school teachers. Text-books and school apparatus were also submitted to and 
reported on by the association, 
The session of 1859 was held in Newbern. The chief subjects of discussion were 
normal schools, uniformity of text-books, a military and polytechnic school, coed- 
ucation of the sexes, female schools, the practicability of enlarging and elevating 
the course of study in the common schools, and graded schools. A committee 
was appointed on the last-named subject and directed to report at the next meet- 
ing, which was held in Wilmington November 13-15, 1860. The principal subjects 
for discussion at that meeting were text-books, female teachers, enlarging and 
elevating the school course, graded schools, and normal schools. A plan to divide 
the State into five districts and to establish a normal school in each was presented 
to the association. It was discussed and a committee was appointed to bring the 
matter before the coming session of the fegislature, but the plan proposed met 
with opposition in the association itself, was bitterly attacked through the press, 
and failed in the legislature. There was also a report on graded schools by Prof, 
C. W. Smythe, which does not seem to have attracted much attention, although 
there had been an educational meeting in Wilmington in April, 1860, to consider 
the establishment cf such schools in that city, and a committee, consisting of 
R. H. Cowan, Dr. William G. Thomas, A. Martin, G. Potter, A. J. De Rossett, E. 
Murray, and S. D. Wallace, had been appointed to make arrangements to calla 
town meeting to consider the same. 
The legislature of 1860-61 granted an act of incorporation to the association. It 
was allowed to hold property up to $20,000, and the superintendent of common 
schools was made a member of its executive committee. It was authorized to pub-

lish the North Carolina Journal of Education, which was to present from time to 
time such decisions of the superintendent as seemed proper, and once in two years 
tomake a digest of the school laws of the State. The association was further 
granted $600 per year from the State treasury for four years, beginning with 
1859. With this small appropriation it would have been possible for the associa- 
tion to enter upon a new career of prosperity had it not been for the war. 
The meeting for 1861 was held in Greensboro, November 19-21. The subjects 
of discussion were very much what they had been at earlier meetings—text- 
books, normal and graded schools, and female teachers. Naturally the supply 
and character of the text-books formed a large part of the discussions of the 
meeting, and there was a long address to the State convention, then in session, 
asking for their continued favor and support to the common schools. 
The session of the association for 1862 was held in Lincolnton, October 13, 
where the supply of Southern text-books was the main topic. I have been ablesto 
find no record of any meetings in 1863 or 1864. I find that the question of a meet- 
ing was discussed in the fall of 1865, but of its results I know nothing. 
  IX. Tan Civin W4r AND THE END oF THE OLD RitGimn. 
Having traced the history of the common schools in North Carolina from the 
earliest times down to the beginning of the civil war, we must now trace their 
struggle for bare existence through that momentous epoch. In the meantime it 
may be desirable to review their condition in 1860-61, in order to see the powers 
at their command to meet the strain that was now to be put upen them. This 
can not be done better than in the language of Dr. Wiley himself. 
“The first superintendent went into office in January, 1852 [1853], and nine 
years afterwards, to wit, in January, 1861, the system of common schools was an 
established interest, respected and cherished by all parties and classes. It had 
fought its way against strong antagonisms, it had cleared its path of formidable 
obstructions, and now its character and capabilities were understood and appre- 
ciated, and it had arrived at that point whence more rapid advancement and higher 
deveiopment were reasonable expectations. The machinery committed to subor- 
dinate officials was worked smoothly and efficiently by men trained to their duties. 
The number of local officers was over 10,000, and the great majority of these had 
become familiar with the management of the system, understood its laws, and 
were in sympathy with each other and with their head; public opinion had been 
enlightened by all possible means, and the whole educational force of the State 
had been welded together. The cause of education in all departments had made 
rapid progress, and North Carolina was acknowledged to be the banner State of 
the South, not only for her common schools, but in academic and collegiate prog- 
ress. ... 
‘Oar progress excited attention and interest in every part of the Union. The 
superintendent was applied to from various Southern States for copies of our com- 
mon-school laws, and for suggestions and plans, and was invited to visit the leg- 
islature of Georgia, with offers of expenses, and, being unable to go, was asked for 
an essay, which the chairman of one of the committees on education in that body 
incorporated into an elaborate report to it. The means for the regular and sys- 
tematic improvement of teachers had been carefully matured, and were werking 
their accomplishment; the body of teachers, asa whole, had been completely revo- 
lutionized, and the superintendent’s persistent efforts had infused into it a large 
element, constantly increasing, of refining and elevating female influence. 
“The State Educational Association, and the appliances for its usefulness, and 
especially its journal, had been firmly established at the cost of much exertion, 
and of considerable pecuniary outlay. ... 
“The continued efforts of the superintendent were also ripening into systematic 
efforts to save and make available that vast, long-neglected, and somewhat myth- 
ical resource of the literary board called the swamp lands; and through his means 
a beginning was made to ascertain the location, titles, and qualities of these, and 
to protect them from squatters and timber getters. In the meantime all legisla- 
tion on the subject of education of every kind and on the literary fund had be- 
come systematic. Through the influence of the superintendent the policy of 
making loans of the funds to individuals and to private institutions was discon-

tinued, and for important reasons, the speaker of the two houses of the legislature, 
without solicitation from the superintendent, had adopted the habit of consulting 
him about the committees on education,'! and these committees sat jointly, invit- 
ing the superintendent to attend as a consulting or corresponding member, and 
every bill relative to education in any of its branches, and to the school fund or 
school taxes, was subinitted to him. 
“The State Educational Association was ramifying into county societies, the 
superintendent was organizing, without public aid, teachers’ institutes, and under 
his influence county superintendents were visiting their districts, in some instances 
making resurveys of their counties, and were making out maps for their use and 
that of the superintendent. .. . 
‘“‘ Hitherto the system, in machinery, was horizontal, though often it cropped 
upward by voluntary effort into higher developments. The superintendent had 
pointed out its availabilities in this respect, and he had legislative provision made 
to enable parties wishing higher grades to secure them in a way just to all. One 
or several individuals, for instance, contributing means equal to or greater than 
the fund coming to the district, were authorized to make bargains with the school 
committee whereby these parties could select the teacher from among those regu- 
larly licensed, and manage the school, always in a way not to prejudice the rights 
of any of the children, This was in accordance with the genius of common 
schools—people whose children were to receive only an English education were 
not taxed to promote special studies useful only to a class, and those desiring to 
pursue such studies could do so economically and under the moral restraints of 
home, through the working of the common schools. Arrangements of this kind 
were becoming common,.there were a number of admirable schools of the kind in 
the State, and cases could be mentioned of ladies thus highly educated and of 
men afterwards distinguished who were thus prepared for college. 
‘But a different.machinery was needed in the cities and larger towns paying 
heavy sums of school taxes, and the beginning of the late war found the super- 
intendent just preparing to launch a carefully matured system of graded 
schools. . . . 
  To this review may be added the following statistics for 1840 and 1860, taken 
from Governor Ellis’s message to the general assembly of 1860-61 (p. 17):

The movement of North Carolina toward the cause of secession was slow and 
deliberate. The State legislature of 1860-61 had refused at first to consider the 
question; then provision was made for calling a convention. This was defeated by 
popular vote in February, 1861. Then all the surrounding States seceded, and 
President Lincoln made his call on her for troops. It was not until then that the 
secession sentiment became predominant. The State seceded May 20,1861. There 
was then danger that the people, having been slow and deliberate in making up 
their minds to enter the Confederacy, would now, with that fixed purpose before 
them, sacrifice all other interests to the war. It became obvious to a calm 
observer that there was danger of uprooting State institutions, and with them 
those ideas of local self-government and independence which are necessary for 
freedom, 
  
1Dr. Wiley virtually dictated these committees.

These new perils to the school system, just now coming to maturity, ‘filled the 
superintendent with unspeakable concern, and the anxiety lest the result of years 
of toil and prayer should be suddenly blasted in the very dawn of triumph will 
never be known on earth outside of his own mind and heart. But his duty was 
to stand by his trust, to continue at his post, and there to serve his Divine Master 
and his generation.” 
It was evident that efforts would be made to exploit the school fund for war 
purposes, and against this effort Dr. Wiley tried to fortify himself. On May 4, 
1861, he addressed a circular to the county superintendents, in which he recited 
the necessity the State was under to borrow money for war needs; that some per- 
sons, without due reflection, might propose to take the proceeds of the common- 
school fund. This action would create a panic and produce the impression that 
the people of the State were not patriotic enough to pay a moderate tax for war 
purposes. He was anxious to aid the State and at the same time to save the school 
fund. To do this he proposed that the unexpended balances of the school fund 
which remained oyer in the various counties from year to year should be invested 
in State bonds taken at par. This investment would amount to something like 
the interest on a loan of a million of dollars. 
«This would enhance our sense of our own resources, and would be a most useful 
and most gratifying achievement. . . . Of course the market value of State bonds 
is now below par, but if we secure our independence and the State does not 
repudiate, these bonds will soon be valuable, and can be converted into cash when 
needed. If we are subjected or the State repudiates her bonds we will be so 
hopelessly ruined that it will make little difference how our county funds are 
invested. By such aninvestment the counties will get interest on money not now 
needed, and they may save themselves from a much worse resort.” 
It does not appear that this suggestion was ever put into operation. In fact, it 
is not probable that it would have saved, under any circumstances, the fund from 
the attacks that were made on it. 
Tho firstlegislature to assemble after the beginning of the war had to make pro- 
visions necessary for carrying it on. It was then that Dr. Wiley feared an attack 
on the literary fund. Before the meeting of the legislature he 
“asked and received permission to attend the meeting of the governor's council, at 
which were matured the first executive recommendations for the impending crisis. 
The governor was in feeble health, wasting with consumption and the weight of 
public cares, and the meeting was at his residence. Tho superintendent was 
kindly received and patiently listened to on that memorable occasion, and then 
and there was fixed a policy which will ever be honorable to the State. It was 
suggested that the school fund of over $2,000,000 would seem large to some, and 
a ready means for the prosecution of the war and to save taxation, and that 
under these plausible pretexts the slumbering opposition to the schools would 
unite short-sighted friends, and by a temporary suspension aim to destroy them 
forever. And it was argued that though the fund was indeed a large one, in one 
sense, it was but an inconsiderable item in the expenses about to be incurred, and 
that if we were able to engage in hostilities at all we were able to do without it; that 
if it was desired to popularize the war it would be most injudicious to begin it by 
the suspension of a system which was the poor man’s life, and which would be so 
essential to the orphans of the soldiers called to surrender their lives for the com- 
mon good; and that now when it was aimed to vindicate Southern civilization 
before the world it would surely be an unwise step to begin by the voluntary 
destruction of an efficient system of popular instruction; that no people could 
or would be free who were unable or unwilling to educate their children. True 
independence must be based on moral character and on popular intelligence and 
industrial development, and thus in the momentous struggle about to begin it 
would impart confidence to the public mind to see the State enter the contest with 
the apparent assurance that her interior interests were not endangered by her 
course; that war under any circumstances was destructive for the time, and that 
the pending contest might be long and exhausting; and that it was the part of wis- 
dom and patriotism so to act that the end should find the fewest possible desolations 
to be repaired, and no permanent weakening of the elements of social elevation. 
These considerations prevailed, and the executive power of the State, represented

by the governor and his council, entered into an informal but solemn agreement 
with the superintendent of common schools to oppose, with him, all attempts to 
seize the fund for war purposes, or to suspend the schools; and the compact was 
faithfully observed by Governor Ellis and his three [two] successors during the 
war, and by their constitutional advisers.” 
The North Carolina Educational Association also added its pleadings for the 
integrity of the school fund, and in a memorial to the State convention in Novem- 
ber, 1861, asked that ‘‘by an amendment to the constitution the proceeds of the 
common-school fund be sacredly and permanently secured to their original pur- 
pose.” The memorial recites that while— 
“The proceeds of the school fund would be barely sufficient to equip and keep 
in the field for military operations about 100 men, as now applied they give 
life to some 4,000 schools and are furnishing an elementary education to over 
150,000 children. This much they now directly accomplish, and their certain 
tendency is to widen and deepen among the masses the spirit of education, and 
thus to sustain that vast superstructure of classical schools, seminaries, and col- 
leges which constitutes the present glory of North Carolina and the great hope of 
the future of the State.” 
It was well that Dr. Wiley and the educational association had thus prepared. 
themselves against the day of attack, for it came soon after the legislature met.1 The 
measure was introduced into the senate and was backed by parties of the highest 
standing. The superintendent in the meantime had sent circulars to the school 
boards of the counties, apprising them of and warning them against the effort. 
These local school officers were usually men of position and influence in their 
respective communities, and their answers were generally in favor of the school 
fund. Governor John M. Morehead was then a member of the State senate, and 
led the defense of the fund. The attempt was defeated, but it reappeared again 
and again in new forms and in both branches. It was protracted and strong, and 
closed only with the adjournment. With the end of this legislature the fight was 
practically won. Succeeding governors followed in the steps of Governor Ellis, 
and succeeding legislatures respected the action of the earlier body.” 
The distribution of funds to the schools during the war period was about as fol- 
lows: In May, 1861, the local school authorities were assured that there would be 
no permanent falling of in the school fund, but during this year only one-half of 
the dividend due was paid out, and this was not made payable until April 1, 1862. 
This delay was due to the great and inevitable pressure brought to bear upon the 
treasury at the outbreak of the war and under which the literary fund, like the 
school fund of 1754, was temporarily diverted. This pressure was finally relieved. 
In October, 1862, $100,000 was distributed. This was the largest semiannual diyi- 
dend ever paid, but it was intended to cover a dividend and a half formerly 
withheld. 
This irregularity brought down wrath upon the head of the system. Jonathan 
Worth, of Randolph County, one of the earliest and most steadfast friends of the 
schools, and afterwards governor, writes to Dr. Wiley under date of June 6, 1862: 
«It seems to be the pleasure of the literary board to assume legislative power 
over the literary fund and to disregard the will of the legislature and of the con- 
vention. Neither the board nor the treasurer, even with your assent, has any 
1 The first extra session of the assembly met May 1, 1861, and adjourned May 13 until June 25. 
In the meantime an ordinance of the State convention changed the date of reassembling. The 
second extra session began August 15, 1861, and adjourned September 23, 1861. On September 9 
Mr. Candler introduced a bill “to prevent the collection of tax for common-school purposes 
during the war.” (Senate J., 36,104.) This act became a law on September 21. (Laws of 1861, 
2d extra, ch. 31.) It repealed that section of the code which required the county courts to levy 
and collect a tax for school purposes, but provided that the act was not to apply ‘‘to those coun- 
ties where the justices, a majority being prosent, shall elect to lay such tax.”

Journal, 1881-1883. The Journals of the legislature of 1861 fail to mention this fight.

right to withhold or direct the fund as they have been doing. They had no right 
to declare a dividend last fall and postpone its payment till this spring. It wasa 
legislative usurpation, and I think a reprehensible usurpation, after the repeated 
refusals of the general assembly to allow any encroachment on this fund. I 
believe the convention also refused to interfere with it. If the board had previ- 
ously made illegitimate dividends, so that there was no money in the treasurer's 
hands, then they made dividends they ought not to have made and they were cul- 
pably negligent of the treasurer’s accounts. The uncertainty which their illegal 
action occasions is about as pernicious to the school system as would bea diversion 
of the income of the fund to the ordinary or war expenses of the State by an act 
of the general assembly.” 
From this time on, so far as I have been able to learn, this fund was paid regu- 
larly. But the counties were not always as faithful to their educational trust as 
was the State. As has been said, a law of 1861 released them from the require- 
ment to levy taxes to support the schools. Some counties, as Edgecombe in 1862, 
and Mecklenburg, voted to use the school money for war purposes. Others, as 
Granville, refused to levy taxes for the support of schools and said that they must 
stop until the war was over. Others seem to have let them fall into abeyance and 
die, They did not think their death even a matter of sufficient importance to be 
reported to the superintendent. But such cases were the exception, not the rule. 
In his ninth annual report, for 1861-62 (Doc. 9, sess. 1862-63), Dr. Wiley dis- 
cusses the situation as it then appeared. 
The legislature of 1860-61 (chap. 19) changed the school year to make it more 
convenient and uniform, The county chairmen, under the new law, were required 
to report on or before the third Monday in April, at the end of the school term 
instead of the middle. The labor of adjustment to the new requirements and to 
pressure of war made these reports more irregular than usual, but official reports 
were received from 65 counties. The receipts reported in 60 counties, including 
balances, was $220,312.99; disbursements, $117,924.50; on hand, $104, 6. The 
number of children reported in 46 counties was, boys, 57,157; girls, 54,890; sex not 
stated, 6,755; total, 118,802. The number of districts in 58 counties was 2,621; the 
children attending school in 59 counties, 52,018, or 29,122 boys, 22,838 girls, and 58 
sex not given; number of licenses granted and reported, 1,233—-962 to men, 271 to 
women; schools reported, 1,556; average length of schools, 2.8 months. 
The superintendent felt authorized to say that more children were taught in the 
counties officially heard from than were actually reported, that this discrepancy 
was due to the nature of the schools, and that as many as 60,000 children had been 
in school in the State.   
     
“Let it be borne in mind, in connection with these facts, that our common-school 
system had to encounter during the past year not only the difficulties naturally 
incident to revolution and war, but trials which, in times of peace, would greatly 
impair the energies of any enterprise. The novelty and the all-absorbing interest 
of the tremendous struggle in which our country is engaged necessarily distracted 
the minds of all classes of the community, and until we became used to revolu- 
tion in our political relations and to a state of war a great many would naturally 
feel indisposed to devote much attention to the usual avocations of life. There 
were also some who supposed that our contest for independence would be of brief 
duration, and that all the agencies of society could be suspended during the strug- 
gle without injury, and others, still more shortsighted, seemed to think that a 
war for political, commercial, social, and intellectual independence could be 
waged with better results by arresiing or destroying all those springs of life on 
which national wealth and greatness are founded.” 
Another difficulty was that of procuring text-books, This became so pro- 
nounced that the writing and publication of text-books grew into an important 
business interest in the Confederate States. 
«The cheerful radiance of letters has not been for a moment extinguished even 
during the deepest gloom and the most terrible throes of this great crisis; and in 
the midst of a shock with which the whole continent trembles, our public schools 
  «
-P-A-G-E-329

gave birth to an enterprise worth more to the independence and character of the 
South than all the money ever expended on them.” 
The method of procedure in the matter of schoolbooks was a question of some 
delicacy. Some thought that the publication of books ought to be encouraged by 
a bounty from the State; others that there should be a tribunal to decide on the 
manuscripts to be published; and nearly all that there should be a protective tariff 
in favor of local or State talent. The State Educational Association finally deter- 
mined that ‘‘ the whole educational influence of North Carolina could be pledged 
to sustain, when worthy, home publications in preference to any other, whatever 
might be the difference in price or mechanical execution.” 
The superintendent was embarrassed as to the proper action to be pursued by 
himself on the publication of a work. 
“But after careful consideration I adopted the plan of not recommending any 
home series of works for exclusive use, but of indorsing all that I deemed worthy 
of public confidence and patronage. ... My indorsement of a book as superin- 
tendent of common schools simply brings it to the notice of all our school authori- 
ties and warrants them in introducing it without fear into the common schools, 
while, the recommendation not being special and exclusive, is not in the way of 
rival claimants of public favor.” 
The report for 1863 resumes the review: 
“The present generation does not need to be told that it was hard to keep up a 
general educational system in any part of the Confederate States of America dur- 
ing the year 1863 . . . and it is, therefore, a subject of devout gratitude to me to 
be able to announce that our common schools still live and are still full of glorious 
promise. Through all this dark night of storm their cheerful radiance has been 
seen on every hill and in every valley of our dear old State; and while the whole 
continent reels with the shock of terrible and ruthless war, covering the face of 
nature with ruin and desolation, there are here scattered through the wilderness. 
hundreds of humming hives, where thousands of youthful minds are busily learn- 
ing those peaceful arts which, under the blessing of God, are to preserve our civ- 
ilization and to aid in perpetuating the liberty and independence for which this 
generation is manfully contending. This prospect more than repays all the toils, 
anxieties, and vigils of those to whose keeping is committed the great moral trust; 
and if the labors, denials, and responsibilities of those who nurse our educational 
system are unnoticed in this stirring and martial age, they havein their own hearts 
a consolation infinitely more valuable than any reward the world can confer.” 
Reports had been received during 1863 from about 60 counties, but these were 
inexact and ununiform. The whole number of districts as reported in 47 coun- 
ties was 2,149; the number of schools taught in 50 counties was 1,076; teachers 
licensed in 44 counties, 872, of whom 348 were women; children attending school in 
50 counties—boys, 18,977; girls, 16,518; total, 35,495; average length of school year, 
three months; average salary per month, $25; the receipts of money in 54 counties 
was $240,685.38; the disbursements $81,588,564, not including money then on hand 
for schools not finished. There had been an increasing difficulty in securing a 
supply of teachers; as the war went on the difficulty became greater, for school- 
teachers were not exempt from conscription in North Carolina (as they were in 
Georgia), but ‘the increasing number of female teachers not only gives promise 
of an ultimate supply of laborers for all our schools, but is a sure augury of their 
greater efficiency.” 
The depreciation of the currency had made it impossible to employ teachers in 
some districts with the funds due them; some waited until the funds accumulated; 
in others the schools were taught, but the drafts held back with the hope of 
obtaining funds of a higher market value. In some it was found impossible to 
get active committees, for the reason that ‘‘nearly every man of that useful class _ 
which is willing to assume, without remuneration, responsibilities in behalf of - 
popular education and improvement, is gone to the army.”

1458 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
It was estimated that during this year the schools were attended by 50,000 
children. Says Dr. Wiley: 
“The future historian of this stirring age will not fail to find evidences of the 
moral energy which this fact implies; for he will see that these schools had to 
be chiefly supplied with books written and printed in the State after the com- 
mencement of the revolution and in face of incredible difficulties, that they were 
all regularly visited by a State Journal of Education at atime when periodical lit- 
erature was at a low ebb, and that educational associations still held their meet- 
ings, and still discussed plans for popular improvement.” 
Dr. Wiley then proceeds to point out the weakness of the school system as it 
stood and to suggest a remedy. The great defect of the system was that it was 
‘ a horizontal one, ‘‘furnishing one kind of education for children of all ages and 
of every degree of advancement.” As the school system elevated the standard 
of popular intelligence, there was an increasing necessity for higher ones. In this 
report (1863) and in a circular letter addressed to the authorities and people of 
North Carolina this year it was proposed to organize a series of graded or high 
schools in connection with the common schools of the State, ‘‘ the first and immediate 
purpose being to furnish facilities for a thorough business education to young men 
disabled in the army and to the children of indigent soldiers, while a second and 
important object will be to promote the general interests of the people of the 
State.” The plan was now proposed that ‘‘in addition to the annual distribution 
from the literary fund for common-school purposes, an additional amount should be 
appropriated to such counties as should raise a like or greater sum by taxes—the 
amount to be employed in supporting graded or higher schools for the education 
of disabled soldiers and the indigent children of those who have entered the army 
for teachers and for other useful and honorable occupations.” To advance this 
purpose agents were appointed in each county to agitate for and advance the 
interests of these schools. As a reward these agents were to have exemption from 
service in the home guards, and they were to strive to secure donations for a county 
fund, to secure buildings in a convenient and healthy locality, and to enlist the 
sympathy and interest of the county authorities and of the public. 
The subject of graded schools had been discussed by the North Carolina Educa- 
tional Association in 1859, and a committee had been appointed on the matter. A 
pill for the creation of graded schools was introduced in the legislature of 1863, 
by William 8, Harris, of Cabarrus. It had been approved by the literary board 
and was warmly pressed by the governor. It passed the house, but not before 
being crippled by an amendment to the effect that 20 per cent of the fund be given 
to all the counties, and that the local authorities be left to decide the question of 
graded schools for themselves, this amendment being due to the false idea that 20 
per cent of the whole school fund was to be set aside and given to such counties 
as organized graded schools. The bill in its amended form passed the house and 
was sent to the senate. It was reported back favorably from the committee, but 
was tabled for lack of time. This was the end of the efforts in the session of 1863. 
An act to grade the common schools was passed December 23, 1864. It provided 
that the president and directors of the literary fund should not ‘for any purpose 
whatever, except the want of income, diminish the usual semiannual appropria- 
tions to what are now known as the common schools of the State, and these appro- 
priations, with the county taxes, levied under existing laws for school purposes, 
shall be applied as heretofore. But when the income of the literary fund shall 
exceed those appropriations, the president and directors of the fund shall apply 
such portion of the surplus as they deem proper to the use of graded schools, 
dividing the amount among all the counties in the same ratio with other distribu- 
tions.” It also provided that when any individual made a subscription to a school 
amounting to more than that derived from the public, he was to be allowed to 
appoint the teacher and fix the salary and the length of the school term. When the
-P-A-G-E-331
    
COMMON SCHOOLS OF NORTH CAROLINA. 1459 
funds allowed a school to be kept open more than six months, the surplus was to 
be put into school buildings, books, and apparatus. When funds would justify, 
the school was to be divided into the primary and high-school departments, and it 
was the duty of the superintendent to recommend a course of study for the higher 
department. 
The inherent defects in this law were enough to cause its failure had there been 
no other. 
The passage in the message of Governor Vance to this assembly which deals 
with education deserves being put on record not only for the sentiments expressed, 
but because of the fact that it is one of the last official expressions of North Caro- 
lina on the subject of education while a member of the Southern Confederacy. 
Governor Vance said (November 21, 1864): 
“The subject of our common schools is one which I beg you will not forget 
amid the great concerns of the war. The efforts making by the friends of educa- 
tion, with our zealous and indefatigable superintendent at their head, to prevent 
the public from losing sight of this great interest is worthy of our admiration. 
I earnestly recommend to your consideration the whole subject, and especially the 
system of graded schools advocated by the superintendent, for which memorials 
will be presented by the literary board and the Educational Association of North 
Carolina. I also suggest that regular teachers be exempted from State military 
duty whilst employed in teaching. Though fully aware of the importance of their 
vocation, I have not felt at liberty to excuse them under existing laws.! The 
common schools should surely be kept going at every cost; and if sufficient induce- 
ments can not be offered to disabled soldiers and educated women to take hold of 
them, the necessary males should be exempted. . . . It is with pride that I observe 
the publication in our State of various new school books, creditable alike to the 
authors and to the public which has demanded them. Our great system of com- 
mon schools is, after all, our only true and solid foundation for public education 
and demands your constant and fostering care.” 
The continued fall of Confederate currency was another cause of trouble. The 
funding bill which took effect April 1, 1864, put county chairmen in uncer- 
tainty whether the school funds in their hands should be thus scaled. They had 
only a choice between funding in Confederate bonds or further depreciation.* 
They asked Dr. Wiley for advice. He was himself brought into sore trouble 
over the depreciation. His salary was not enough “to board a horse,” and so he 
concluded in 1864 tolive withoutit. ‘‘ Throughout the war I have devoted myself 
to the schools, and have tried to live on a salary averaging hardly $200 in par 
funds for four years.” When the board came in the spring of 1865 to pay his 
$2,000 salary due for 1864, they offered it in State coupons and Confederate cur- 
rency, which at the then rate of depreciation made his salary for 1864 amount to 
$700 in the currency of 1864. 
But notwithstanding all of the storm and stress of the war period, the light of 
the common schools—now changed to public schools so as to include the primary 
and the graded schools—shone on. And Dr. Wiley stated in a speech before the 
State Educational Association in 1874 that he was receiving reports from school 
officers in different parts of the State at the time he heard of the surrender of 
Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, April 26, 1865. The schools were closed at the end of 
the war only because of the loss of their funds. The disposition had been mani- 
fested from time to time to change the form of these investments. It was the 
general policy to encourage Confederate securities, but it was a difficult matter to 
  
1 The extra session, June 30 to July 7, 1863, exempted “All persons engaged in editing or pub- 
lishing classical or common-school books and all persons actually engaged in printing or binding 
such books.” (House Journal, p. 44.) By chapter 18 of the laws of this session one editor for 
each newspaper, the necessary compositors, mail carriers, professors in colleges, and teachers 
in academies were exempted from service in the home guards. 
2On May 28, 1864, county chairmen who had invested in Confederate bonds were authorized by 
act to sell these bonds and distribute the proceeds among the districts.

1460 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
change an investment, especially one of a fiduciary character, anu as the principal 
of the literary fund was in what was then the best possible securities—bank and 
railroad stock—it seemed that there could be no reason for a change. 
Early in the war Dr. Wiley had recommended to the literary board that they 
agree to make no change in the investment. This policy was adopted and was 
followed to the end of the war. One of the results was that while the fund was 
not invested in Confederate securities, and was thus saved from destruction 
direct, it was retained as a part of the capital stock of the banks of the State and of 
Cape Fear, which invested in these securities, and perished in the wreck of the old 
banking system after the close of the war. But there still remained to the banks, 
according to Dr. Wiley, a considerable amount of assets. Further, some of the 
county chairmen had invested the county school funds in Confederate bonds, which 
were lost. Besides this, the war made the collection of interest, notes, etc., more 
difficult. In 1863 the literary board complained to the legislature of the carelessness 
with which the proofs of indebtedness, certificates of stock, etc., had been kept, and 
an act to define further the duties of the treasurer of the literary fund was passed 
December 14, 1863, to cover the necessities of the case. Dr. Wiley says also that 
the financial system of the schools had been conducted on such a simple and 
admirable basis that little loss or confusion was brought about by the collapse and 
surrender of the Southern armies and that $10,000 in good currency would have 
paid all outstanding debts to teachers, officers, and printers. But this sum was 
wanting, and a part of these debts fell on him in his personal capacity. 
Dr. Wiley remained in office after the close of hostilities and until the constitu- 
tional convention declared by ordinance on October 19, 1865, that all offices of 
the State in existence on April 26, 1865, should be vacated.’ His last report as 
superintendent accompanies the message of Governor Worth to the assembly of 
1865-66, is dated January 18, 1866, and forms pages 23-36 of Document 47, session 
of 1865-66. This report contains no statistics and no definite information on the 
condition of the schools in the last days of the war, but has some suggestions of 
value. He reviews the fortunes of the school fund in the war period; the need 
of money, of men, and of text-books: 
“To the lasting honor of North Carolina her public schools survived the terri- 
ble shock of cruel war, and the State of the South which furnished most material 
and the greatest number and the bravest troops to the war did more than all the 
others for the cause of popular education. The common schools lived and dis- 
charged their useful mission through all the gloom and trials of the conflict, and 
when the last gun was fired, and veteran armies once hostile were meeting and 
embracing in peace upon our soil, the doors were still open and they numbered. 
their pupils by the scores of thousands. . . . The feeling universal among the peo- ple is that the schools must not go down.” 
Dr. Wiley emphasized the necessity of making some arrangement by which the 
State would be relieved from the poverty then threatening. Many families had 
lost their support, many men were crippled for life, and many children were left 
orphans. The way of escape from pending dangers was thought to be through 
the school and the training of teachers. 
He suggested the use of the remaining principal of the literary fund for the 
needs of the hour. He proposed to make distribution to schools and not to coun- 
ties, so that it would all be used at once and none be allowed to lie idle. He said 
the board then owned in good stocks about $880,000. By his scheme $200,000 
could be expended per year for four years and there would still be left to the State 
from $150,000 to $500,000. 
In connection with the use of the principal of the literary fund he suggests two 
plans: (1) ‘‘ To issue certificates of indebtedness, in sums convenient for general 
circulation, bearing 1 per cent interest, receivable for all State dues, and to be 
  
1 Ordinances, pp. 25-26.
-P-A-G-E-333
COMMON SCHOOLS OF NORTH CAROLINA. 1461 
redeemed in four, five, or six years.” (2) ‘‘ Toconvert the stocks of the fund into 
national securities and establish a national bank under the management of the 
literary board.” But neither of these plans was adopted. The disposition of the 
renaining funds will be considered later. 
At another time he addressed a letter to the legislature developing another plan 
by which he hoped to save the schools from the impendingruin. He says: 
“Permit me to impress upon all a consideration which is sometimes overlooked 
in the discussion of the subject in hand; and that is, that the public schools are 
by constitutional provision, by law, and by established ideas, a part, and an essen- 
tial part, of our State machinery, and, indeed, of our civilization. They are, for 
instance, as much a fixed institution of the State as the university, the lunatic 
asylum, or the institution for the deaf and dumb and the blind; and for every one to 
be benefited by either of these latter there are five hundred interested in the former. 
... These schools, be it remembered, do not propose now to be a burden to the 
State. They ask only permission to use their own capital to the best advantage,a 
capital which the State has no more moral right to seize than it has to appropri- 
ate the property of the university. The assets of the school fund are small com- 
pared with what they have been; but they are still .of immense importance toa 
people who appreciate the blessings of education, and who haveaclear perception 
of the deplorable consequences that will follow the suspension of the public 
schools... . Let us look this straight in the face if we would appreciate the 
importance of our resources. To suspend the public schools is to destroy them; 
and to break them up at such a time is to risk utter demoralization, to add the 
most melancholy wreck of all to the ruins with which we are surrounded. ... 
Let it be added that the abandonment of the cause of education will be regarded 
in this enlightened age as a certain indication of hopeless bankruptcy or of infe- 
rior and retrograding civilization; and either of these conclusions will be fatal to 
our credit and blast a thousand hopes built on expectations of capital and enter- 
prise from abroad. I believe that there is not one of your body but would regret 
to see extinguished forever those thousands of lights which have shed a cheerful 
radiance over every hill and valley of our good old State from the ocean to the 
Smoky Mountains. ... Permit me to say with emphasis that, in my judgment, 
there is no such necessity, and that the people generally, poor as they know the 
State to be, do not believe this. To-day the common-school system is the most 
solvent institution of the State. It is both able to pay its own way and aid the 
State. Why doIsay so? It owes no debts, and it has assets that will soon and 
certainly be worth at least a million of dollars.” ... 
Dr. Wiley then proceeds to develop a plan by which the literary board was to 
be authorized by the State to issue $400,000 in ‘‘ certificates of indebtedness.” He 
says: 
“Tf payable in two years, our teachers will be glad to get them, and if not receiv- 
able for taxes, they would pass. They would in no sense be bills of credit forbid- 
den by the Constitution of the United States. They would be the notes of a cor- 
poration, like bank notes, but not taxable as such, and based on a fixed capital. 
If made receivable for taxes, they would be the best relief which the State could 
afford for the people. They would be put into circulation in every school district, 
and by this universal diffusion be of infinite service in relieving the monetary 
pressure. Two hundred thousand dollars thus diffused would be equal in its 
relief to half a million, or a million loaned by banks: and the State must do some- 
thing to furnish a circulating medium. Here is a plan, simple, practicable, con- 
stitutional, and operating impartially as the dews of Heaven, and while it furnishes 
means everywhere to pay taxes, it keeps in life the most important institution of 
the State, and enables the people to educate their children.” 
The plan was warmly indorsed by the governor, but nothing came of it. 
So deep was Dr. Wiley’s interest in the subject that he adds by way of postscript: 
“T feel bound to warn the friends of the schools against the insidious policy of 
suspension. Had this policy prevailed when it was urged the first year of the war, 
the fund would be now all gone; if it prevails now, the fund will never accumu- 
late, but be fritted away on other institutions. I hear there is a plan on foot to 
turn the poorer elasses over to county systems, to be supported by county taxes. 
This is to degrade a noble State system into a pauper establishment that has here- 
tofore miserably failed in a sister State, and which has been denounced by the 
best men in it. It would render poor white men worse off in educational facilities
-P-A-G-E-334
  1462 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
than the freedmen; and while the world is trying to elevate these latter in the 
social scale, we would be taking steps to degrade our working classes.” 
But the appeal was without effect. The schools went down in the general ruin 
that followed the beginning of reconstruction. 
It now only remains for me to trace briefly the subsequent fortune of the 
remainder of the literary fund anJ to give the leading facts in the private life of 
Dr. Wiley. 
On July 4, 1868, the State was again reorganized by turning out all of the old 
officers and putting in others who had been elected under the constitution of 1868. 
Under the new régime Rey. S. 8S. Ashley was made superintendent of public 
instruction. His first report was made to the general assembly for the session of 
1868-69, is dated November 10, 1868, and addressed to Provisional Governor 
Holden. The system was again reconstructed under the law of April 12, 1869, 
and Ashley continued in office until 1872. His report of November 10, 1868, con- 
tained asummary of the character and value of the literary fund which had escaped 
the wreck of war. The old literary fund was now known as the aducational fund 
and owned stock as follows: 
     
  Cape Fear Navigation Company, 650 shares, at $ $32, 500 
Bank of North Carolina, 5,027 shares, $100 .  §02, 700 
Bank of Cape Fear, 5,444 shares, at $100--_._- 544, 400

Wilmington and Weldon Railroad, 4,000 shares, at $100_.-...-..-.--.-- 400, 900 
Pia eete re ea Ree ea eee 1, 679, 600 
The bank stock, amounting to $1,047,100, was supposed to be nearly or quite 
worthless, and a thorough examination of the affairs of the banks was recom- 
mended. The affairs of the Wilmington and Manchester Railroad were under- 
going an investigation. The corporation was bankrupt and ‘“‘the prospect that 
this stock will be a source of income to the educational fund is not promising.” 
“The stock of the Wilmington and Weldon road will probably become again 
profitable to the holders.” The stock of the Cape Fear Navigation Company, of 
which the State owned 650 shares, was at that time “of no pecuniary benefit to 
the school fund. For twenty-nine years, ending with September, 1863, the annual 
dividends punctually paid to the State amounted to $1,300.” The swamp lands 
were at that time of no pecuniary benefit. The amount derived from the tax on 
auctioneers and from the entry of vacant lands was about $1,500; the tax from 
retailers from October, 1867, to October, 1868, was $6,762.50. Thefund also owned 
6 per cent coupon bonds, dated prior to May 20, 1861, and amounting January 1, 
1866, to $20,600. It had been increased by three 6 per cent certificates ae indebted- 
ness given by the State as follows: 
   
      Certificate dated June 1, 1867 -- $820, 070.50 
Certificate dated October 24, 1867 - 380, 278. 50 
Certificate dated January 16, 1868 _. 382, 701.00 
RGN re ee et ay ee ee eee at 383, 045. 00 
The total income of the school fund from all sources was $32,982.70. This repre- 
sents all, and more than all, that had been saved from the great fund which had 
been accumulated and devoted to the common schools.® 
1 Dr. Wiley had been one of the first to advocate the education of the negro. 
2 Other superintendents have been as follows: Alexander McIver, 1873-1875; Stephen D. Pool, 
1875-1877; John C. Scarborough, 1877-1885, 1893-1897; Sidney M. Finger, 1885-1893; Charles H. 
Mebane, 1897 to date. 
®In January, 1869, the board of education proposed to issue $500,000 in bonds with interest pay- 
able semiannually for,use of the school. The interest was to be secured by one-half of the tax 
for educational purposes and a sinking fund was to be created to meet the principal.
-P-A-G-E-335
  COMMON SCHOOLS OF NORTH CAROLINA. 1463 
During the next year (1869) all the railroad stock belonging to the fund was 
sold to W. T. Walters, of Baltimore. He paid for the 4,000 shares of Wilmington 
and Weldon Railroad $148,000, and for the 2,000 shares of the Wilmington and 
Manchester road $10,000. This money was invested in new State bonds, and the 
superintendent says: 
«The sale of these stocks will realize to the board a permanent paying capital of 
not less than $450,000. The original investment was $600,000. The loss, therefore, 
will not exceed $150,000. It is certainly cause for congratulation and encourage- 
ment that so large a sum has been rescued from a condition of utter unavailability 
and made to contribute yearly to the support of public schools.” 
May 1, 1869, the stock of the Cape Fear Navigation Company was also sold for 
$8,250, or at the rate of 10 cents on the dollar. 
There were, besides these funds, stocks amounting to $1,097,100, which were 
considered as worthless (Bank of North Carolina, $502,700; Bank of Cape Fear, 
$544,400, and Roanoke Navigation Company, $50,000). When the Bank of North 
Carolina went into bankruptcy, an effort was made to protect the interests of the 
educational fund, and : 
“by the advice of able legal counsel proceedings were instituted against the 
assignee in bankruptcy of the Bank of North Carolina to establish the right of 
the board of education to prove their stock in said bank as a debt against its assets 
in bankruptcy. The matter was argued before Chief Justice Chase at the late 
June term of the circuit court of the United States for this district, and the deci- 
sion of the Chief Justice was against the board. An appeal was taken to the 
Supreme Court of the United States, but in view of the uncertainty of gaining 
the case and of the great expense attending its prosecution, the appeal was with- 
drawn. The bank stock aforesaid owned by the board may therefore. be con- 
sidered worthless.” 
“The Roanoke Navigation stock should be valuable; accordingly the board 
hopes to turn it to account,” but it was then not available. After deducting these 
amounts it was found that the “net public-school fund” was ‘‘not less than 
$968,242.43 ” on November 1, 1869. 
In the report of Superintendent Ashley for 1870-71 the only source of revenue 
of the public schools mentioned are the State tax on polls, county tax on polls, 
special tax of one-twelfth of 1 per cent,and a tax on retailers of spirituous liquors. 
It was reported that the stock in the Bank of Cape Fear was worthless and could 
not be relied on for any ‘“‘ future pecuniary availability.” Efforts had been made 
to sell the Roanoke Navigation stock, but to no purpose. There was due to the 
board from the State as accrued and unpaid interest on coupon bonds and certifi- 
cates of indebtedness $60,291.75, besides $27,000 interest for one year on $450,000 
in special-tax bonds purchased by the board from the proceeds of the sale of rail- 
road stock. The total interest then due from the State was $87,291.75. I have 
been able to find no evidence that this sum was ever paid, unless it is included in 
the ‘‘ special appropriation,” made during the year 1870-71, of $92,976.04. 
The fortunes of the old literary fund may be summarized as follows: In 1860 this 
fund amounted to more than $2,000,000. The failure of the banks in whose stock 
a part of the principal was invested reduced this fund to less than $1,000,000 in 
1869. This consisted in depreciated railroad stock, which was sold at from 10 to 
87 cents on the dollar. The money thus realized was invested in North Carolina 
special-tax bonds, bought at a discount. These were repudiated by the State. 
From that time (1870) practically all the support of the public schools has been 
derived from the annual State, county, and municipal taxes.! 
1It seems that there was a slight effort made after this to accumulate an educational fund. 
The report for 1872-73 gives, under the head of ‘Permanent fund,” $23,307.26}, which had been 
derived from entries on vacant lands, fines, and a balance on hand from the previous year. Of 
this sum, $16,218.75 was invested in United States bonds. The receipts of the “income fund”

  1464 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Perhaps the last offical act of Dr. Wiley in the position which he had honored 
so much was writing a pamphlet on the swamp lands of the State, which was pub- 
lished in 1867. It now only remains for me to notice his work as a private citizen 
in other capacities. 
Dr. Wiley had felt himself called to preach at an early period in Hi educational 
career. He studied theology and was licensed by Orange Presbytery in 1855. He 
was ordained sine titulo in 1866 and never held a settled pastorate. He was one 
of the executive committee to found the North Carolina Presbyterian and a con- 
tributor to its columns. His work for the schools had brought him a knowledge 
of the undeveloped lands and other resources of the State and, when the develop- 
ment boom came after the war, was solicited to become a partner in many schemes 
looking to exploiting these resources. In 1867 he was elected corresponding sec- 
retary of the North Carolina Land Company, at a salary of $1,000 a year, and 
began work January 15, 1868. The company proposed to invest in and develop 
the swamp lands of the State, and Dr. Wiley’s business was to collect information 
for pamphlets which were to be circulated abroad. He also sought to make bet- 
ter known the resources of the State by calling a convention of the leading liter- 
ary men of the State in Raleigh in July, 1869. 
On June 1, 1869, he became the general agent for the American Bible Society 
for middle and eastern Tennessee, and took up his residence in Jonesboro, Tenn. 
In March, 1874, on the resignation of Rev. P. A. Strobel, he was transferred to a 
similar position in North Carolina, and removed to Winston, N.C. In 1876 South 
Carolina was added to his field. He remained in this work until his death. 
Dr. Wiley wou!d have been made the candidate of the Conservatives for super- 
intendent of public instruction in 1872 had he not been kept out by political dis- 
ability. Dr. Nereus Mendenhall became the candidate, but the party went down 
in defeat. In 1876 he was again proposed as a candidate on the Conservative 
ticket, and would, no doubt, have been nominated and elected but for his own 
sense of duty. He regretted that the public schools had been brought into politi- 
cal debate, but ‘‘in view of the situation and of what is expected of candidates 
nominated on party platforms, the arena where honorable and good men not of 
my vocation may lawfully strive is closed to me by my sense of the obligations 
of my sacred calling.”! During his later years he devoted himself as far as pos- 
sible to advancing local educational interests, helped to establish the graded school 
in Winston, N. C., and was the chairman of its school board from its organization 
until his death. 
He served the State as superintendent of common schools for thirteen years. 
He was a Whig in politics, and was twice elected by the Whigs and five times by 
the Democrats. He was a trustee of the University of North Carolina from 1875 
until his death, and, although he never held a regular charge, preached frequently 
to Presbyterian and other congregations. He received the degree of D. D. from 
the University of North Carolina in 1881, to whose interest he had been always 
devoted. He married Miss Mittie Towles in Raleigh, N. C., February 25, 1862. 
To this union seven children were born, of whom five still survive. Dr. Wiley 
Hoeeee i eereet on United States bonds” and “dividends Roanoke Navigation Company.” 
These are the only items in this report which indicate that they might have come from the old 
literary fund. 
For the year 1873-74 the navigation dividends and interest on United States bonds amounted 
to $1,748.25. There was also an investment of $19,404.29 in United States bonds. These interest 
items amounted in 1874-75 to $2,461.50. There was then a further investment of $13,682.50 in 
United States bonds. 
These bonds seem to have been carried from year to year as a part of the assets of the educa- 
tional fund until 1881, when they were sold under the direction of the legislature. They then 
amounted to $91,500 and were sold for $106,224.25. The fund also owned $99,200 in State bonds, 
which were offered for sale in 1882, but not sold.

died in Winston, N. C., January 11, 1887. According to a personal friend, who 
knew him intimately, he ‘‘ was very agreeable in social life. He was simple, 
gentle, unpretending, gracious, genial. He had a genuine fund of quiet humor, 
not anecdotical, but spontaneous and innocent. He was a guileless man—true, 
sincere, lovable.” 
X. BIBLIOGRAPHY oF CaLvin H. WILEY. 
Dr. Wiley was a prolific writer. He produced works in history, economics, the- 
ology, and fiction, as well asin education. It is not far from the truth to say that 
his writings represent the whole literature of the North Carolina common schools 
up to the close of the war. A list of his published writings, complete as it can be 
made with the sources at command, is added herewith:

This novel, begun in March, 1849, was attacked in some of the Southern papers as being 
too abolitionist in sentiment, and is defended by Wiley in the Greensboro Patriot, Novem- 
ber 3, 1819, where he denies the charge. It was republished in London in 1851 under the 
title “Adventures of Old Dan Tucker and his son Walter” (see that title), and is probably 
the same as Utopia: A Picture of Early Life at the South, published by Peterson in 1852 (see 
that title).

This Reader was first published in December, 1851 (copyrighted, 1851, and preface dated 
July 4, 1851), at Wiley’s expense. The first part contains a sketch of the State, its geo- 
graphical features, and its varied resources; the second gives the first popular school his- 
tory of the State ever written; the third includes reading lessons, which were mostly the 
~ composition of North Carolinians or related to the State. The book was enthusiastically 
received by the whole press of the State; was approved and adopted by all classes of teach- 
ers, and rapidly found its way to the masses. The first edition, in 1851, was 1,000 copies. 
‘The issues made in 1852 and 1853 raised the whole number of copies published to 6,000. 
The whole of Dr. Wiley’s interest was disposed of when he became superintendent of 
common schools, and there were efforts to make this a part of a series. For this purpose 
Prof. Fordyce M. Hubbard (1909-1888), of the University of North Carolina, was induced to 
undertake the preparation of the remaining volumes under the supervision of Dr. Wiley. 
The whole series was to be published by E. J. Hale & Son, of Fayetteville, but this scheme 
failed. The copyright, etc., was afterwards transferred to A. S. Barnes & Co., of New 
York. (See below.) 
The Reader became and remained a standard until the close of the war. It exerted a 
quiet but immense influence in creating and fostering a new spirit among the masses of the 
people. 
The following pages of the Reader may be ascribed to Dr. Wiley: General description 
of North Carolina, pp. 21-90 (except the poetry); Historical sketch of North Carolina, pp. 
91-223; Female education—woman’s mission, pp. 262-266 (reprinted in Our Living and Our 
Dead, I, pp. 273-276, November, 1874); The sand hills of North Carolina, extract from 
“Alamance,” pp. 266-267; The mission of Washington—Union among men, pp. 269-273, 
omitted in revised edition; Resources of North Carolina, pp. 338-339, omitted in revised 
edition.

Dr. Wiley refused to recommend any geography until allowed to correct the text in 
regard to North Carolina. He also helped to prepare a new map of the State with all rail- 
roads, plank roads, intended routes, etc., indicated. In October, 1865, E. H. Butler & Co., 
successors to Copperthwaite & Co., proposed that Wiley prepare a new edition of his 
appendix which they desired to put into their New Intermediate Geography. I do not 
know the results of the proposal.

Nos. 1 and 2 of this series of North Carolina Readers were the result, as we have 
seen, of a plan which had been evolved by Dr. Wiley before he became Superintendent. 
The transfer of Reader No. III to A. S. Barnes & Co. and the employment of Professor 
Hubbard was completed in the winter of 1853-54. In 1853 Messrs. Barnes proposed to E. J. 
Hale & Co., of Fayetteville, N.C., that Professor Hubbard should take Parker’s Readers 
Nos. 1, 2,3, and 4 and add some 10 per cent more matter of a North Carolina character. 
They were then to be ealled “ North Carolina Readers,” and these four were to be followed 
by Wiley’s No. IILas No. V. This was not done, but new books were compiled.

Dr. Wiley also edited the Oxford Mercury; along with W. D. Cooke, founded 
and edited the Southern Weekly Post, Raleigh; contributed to Sartain’s Union 
Magazine, to the Saturday Evening Post, and helped to found the North Carolina 
Presbyterian. 
Besides the foregoing which are known to be the work of Dr. Wiley I have 
found various references to other work which he had undertaken, but I am 
unable to say whether they were brought to a conclusion and published. In 1852 
a “College address” is mentioned and in 1854 Dr. Deems proposed to publish the 
address which he had delivered at the previous commencement of Greensboro 
Female College. In 1853-54 he proposed publishing a ‘‘Common School Alma- 
nac” and also a ‘‘Primer.” In 1852 W.D. Cooke, Samuel Pearce, and C. H. 
Wiley made a formal and legal agreement to publish a ‘‘Map of North Carolina 
together with a book of reference.” It was to be at their joint risk and each 
was to have an equal share in the copyright and profits. Wiley was to prepare 
the book of reference, ‘‘consisting of a statistical work to accompany the map,” 
on railroads, canals, plank roads, rivers, cities, schools, colleges, productions, and 
general topography. Cooke was to construct the map and prepare it for the 
engraver. He was also to act as secretary and central agent. Pearce was to 
solicit subscribers. Wiley did some work on his part of the undertaking, having 
been particularly interested in the botany of the State, but withdrew in 1854 and 
the undertaking was carried on by the remaining members. The map, known as 
Pearce’s map, was published about August, 1856. The Gazetteer, continued by 
Pearce, was about ready in November, 1860, but was killed by the war. The 
map was again issued in 1871, from New York, by H. H. Lloyd & Co. 
Dr. Wiley had a catechism in hand in 1855 which was about ready to be sent to 
press. It was to be pedagogical in character and to be used asa text-book. It 
was to contain ‘‘short lessons in questions and answers, as to the origin, his- 
tory, and progress [of] common schools generally; their history, character, and

He prepared and published a School Register, which was intended as ‘a daily 
and permanent record of the school,” and had ready in 1857 a ‘‘ Manual” or guide 
for the use of teachers, with extracts from the school laws, etc. He wrote a'soa 
monograph on botany called ‘Catalogue of vegetable productions.” It extended 
to 100 pages. In 1858 he was engaged on a work entitled ‘‘ The duties of Christian 
masters.” 
In 1872 he proposed to A. S, Barnes & Co. to prepare a book on the resources of 
North Carolina and to issue it in three editions, English, French, and German, of 
8,000 copies each. July 4, 1876, he delivered in Greensboro an address on the his- 
tory of Guilford County, in which he traced the sources of its population. He 
had also been engaged for many years in the preparation of a work on Revela- 
tions, which was left unfinished at his death.

    CHAPTER XXX. 
THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY IN CERTAIN FOREIGN 
COUNTRIES." 
REPORT TO THE COUNCIL OF THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY. 
By J. Scorr Keiti£, the Society’s Inspector of Geographical Education. 
A very remarkable thing in the matter of education is the rise in the importance 
which within the last twenty-five years has been given to geography; more 
remarkable still that since that enhanced importance has been made manifest, it 
did not occur sooner to college faculties and other educated thoughtful minds, 
The pamphlet mentioned at the head of this article appeared in the year 1885, 
and contains results of Mr. Keltie’s observations throughout Great Britain and 
several countries in Europe, which he was appointed to make for the Geograph- 
ical Society of London. The extent of those observations, the author’s judicious 
and painstaking use of the facilities everywhere accorded him, his candid admis- 
sion of the inferiority of geographical instruction in his own country as compared 
with several others, especially with the German Emp-re, all contribute to make 
his paper very interesting. A brief review with some extracts is given in this 
article. 
The following from the introduction shows the motive of Mr. Keltie’s appoint- 
ment and the scope of his duties: . 
The object of the council in appointing an inspector of geographical education 
is to obtain fuller information than they now possess regarding the position and 
methods of geographical education in this country and abroad. 
I. As regards the United Kingdom. 
A. The inspector will ascertain, by means of correspondence or by actual inspec- 
tion (1) the extent to which geography of any kind is taught in our universities 
and public schools, and what special rewards are offered for proficiency in it; (2) 
the actual subjects taught under that name and the comparative time allotted to 
them; (3) the methods and appliances used in teaching these subjects; (4) the 
attitude of teachers and professors with regard to geography generally; (5) the 
value allotted to geography in university examinations, and with what subjects 
it is united. 
B. The inspector will consult the reports of the examiners for the Royal Geo- 
graphical Society public-schoo!s medals. 
C. He will ascertain the comparative position of geography in the examinations 
for the English public services, and will acquaint himself with the experiences of 
the examiners. 
Il. As regards the Continent of Europe. 
The inspector will be expected to visit Germany, Austria, France, Switzerland, 
Italy, Belgium, Holland, and Sweden. In making his inquiries on the Continent 
the inspector should keep the following points in view: 
A. The position allotted to geography, especially in high schools and uniyersi- 
ties, as shown (1) by the extent to which it is taught, the maps and other appli- 
ances provided, and the rewards offered in it; (2) by the time allotted to it as com- 
pared with other subjects; (3) its comparative value in examinations; (4) by the

  1476 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
comparative number, status, and emoluments of professors of geography in uni- 
versities as compared with those of professors of other subjects; (5) by the 
attendance of students in the geographical classes. 
B, The extent of the field covered by geographical teaching in high schools and 
universities, and the standpoint from which geography is taught, whether (1) 
from that of physical science; (2) from that of history and politics; (3) from that 
of commerce. 
C. The methods of instruction adopted at various stages from the primary school 
upward. Whether the subject ever attains the position of a discipline, as distin- 
guished from a mere exercise of memory; whether it has been found possible to 
set habitually geographical problems for solution. Also the methods adopted in 
teaching pupils to read maps. 
Ili. As regards America. 
The inspector will ascertain, by correspondence with the proper authorities, the 
condition of geographical education in the United States of America. 
IV. In the prosecution of his inquiries both in the United Kingdom and abroad 
the inspector will collect specimens of the best text-books, maps, globes, diagrams, 
models, and other operations used in teaching the various branches of geography. 
These he will arrange and classify on the society’s premises for the information of 
the council. Where it is impracticable to obtain specimens, the inspector will 
report upon such contrivances as seem to him effective ends to geographical 
instruction, or in developing the geographical imagination. 
V. On the conclusion of his inquiry the inspector will prepare a report embody- 
ing (1) a summary statement of the work done by him; (2) the results of his 
inquiries in the various directions indicated above; (3) the steps which he would 
recommend the council to take in order to improve and extend geographical edu- 
cation in the United Kingdom. 
This commission is dated July 26, 1884. 
Mr. Keltie, in pursuance of these instructions, obtained extensive acquaintance 
with educational institutions at home and on the Continent, beginhing with those 
which had been invited to compete for the society’s medals. Many of these he 
visited in person and attended class examinations. About eighty in the United 
Kingdom were dealt with, some of which, being regarded as representative, were 
described in detail and subjoined in the appendix to his report. It was already 
known to the council that the attention given to geography in the public schools 
and even in the universities was far below being adequate to its importance, and 
the medals bestowed by them for proficiency in the study had been discontinued. 
Of all the institutions, Dulwich College and Liverpool College alone exhibited 
proficiency deserving such reward. 
The subject has grown in importance since primary instruction came under 
the charge of the State. The study was made compulsory, and much progress has 
been made under a system adopted from Germany, known there as Heimatskunde, 
notably in London and some of the other great cities. These schools are abun- 
dantly provided with maps, beginning with those of the district in which the schools 
are situated, the cities and their suburbs; besides these there are in some large wall 
maps, geographical pictures, sheet maps, atlases, relief maps, and accompanying 
those of outlying districts specimens of products, vegetable and mineral, belonging 
to them, 
In the appendix is a very interesting article on the Heimatskunde,' showing how 
minutely the Germans have studied the subject and provided for its instruction 
to the youngest pupils. 
The report of the inspector, when discussing the higher and middle class schools 
of the United Kingdom, grows less and less favorable as it ascends from the pri- 
mary. Inallof these geography is included and receives some degree of attention, 
in many cases nearly nominal and in none as much as it is entitled to, As a gen- 
eral rule it is compulsory to a certain degree; that is, to the lower half of the 
school included in the third and part of the fourth forms downward. Herein it 
received from one hour to two and a half hours a week, while eight to sixteen

TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY ABROAD. 1477 
hours were given to classics and four to eight to mathematics. Evenin that brief 
allotment those who taught were only the class masters, who, with very few excep- 
tions, had received only a classical education, and who therefore taught geography 
reluctantly and inefficiently. This was also only what is known as political 
geography, confined to learning names and situations of prominent features on 
the earth’s surface. ‘‘In one of our greatest public schools,” says Mr. Keltie, ‘it 
seemed to me that a boy might pass through the complete curriculum and never 
get a single lesson in geography, and at best the instruction he might get would 
be fragmentary and meager.” There area few noteworthy exceptions, as Dulwich 
College and Glasgow Academy. In very many it was shown by interviews with 
masters that few of them had just conceptions of what geography really is. It is 
clearly shown that in nearly all of the great schools of Great Britain geography 
receives only a beggarly share of attention compared with other studies, that it is 
confined to the lower classes, except where, in the higher, it is regarded ancillary 
to the study of history. This condition is accounted for in part by the inspector 
in the following paragraph taken from his report: 
On the whole, I am bound to admit that the unsatisfactory position allotted to 
geography in our public schools is not so much the fault of the teachers as of the 
conditions upon which they are compelled to regulate their programmes and their 
methods. A perusal of the statements in the appendix (E), in which many head 
masters have favored me with their views on the geographical situation, will give 
the conviction that the present condition of geography in our public schools is 
almost entirely due to the exigences of examinations. Geography, we are told in 
so many words, ‘does not pay.’ It is not recognized at the universities by either 
professorship or readership; it does not find a real place in any of their examina- 
tions; while in the army and navy examinations it is at a discount, and such 
geography as is given is of very partial character and is left mainly to crammers. 
The head master of one of our oldest public schools told me he deliberately warns 
his pupils to keep their eyes steadily fixed upon the examinations they have in 
view and the careers for which they are destined, and to neglect every subject, 
including geography, which in that view will not pay. 
This at least was the difficulty in the way of geography, the failure of the univer- 
sities to recognize the fullness of its value. The inspector relates that he was told 
by one of the most cultured and successful teachers of geography that the head 
master in the school wherein he taught, and even the assistant masters, used con- 
stant endeavors to make the pupils give up the study entirely. 
‘“‘ There is,” says the inspector, ‘‘no professor of geography in any university or 
university college in this country. The London University examiners profess to 
examine in geography for matriculation, but the questions are bracketed with the 
history paper, and, as an authority informs me, in 90 per cent or more cases are 
shirked or imperfectly answered.” Although there is at Oxford a lecturer on 
geography attached to the school of modern history, still he holds quite a subor- 
dinate place compared with the rest, who regard with derision the idea that any- 
thing scientific can be ascribed to that study, and who profess to be not able to 
see how it can ever be raised to a separate independent subject in the university. 
In Cambridge the subject is regarded as more respectable, and some efforts have 
been made to assign to it a distinct place on the programme. Ina report of the 
special board for biology and geology, dated February 6, 1883, among other sug- 
gestions was this: 
“University teachers should be eventually appointed in the following subjects: 
Agriculture, anthropology, geography, metallurgy, and mining.” The inspector 
ascribes the failures of the appointments recommended mainly to the want of 
funds. At the time of the report of Mr. Keltie the subject was receiving much 
consideration from many of the Cambridge men. Most earnest appeals have been 
made by thoughtful men outside. They are telling words of Professor Mosely, 
one of the society's members, which Mr, Keltie quotes: ‘The more I gain in expe- 
rience by an examination in physical geography, the more I am convinced of its

value as a subject of general education and the more I regret that it is not repre- 
sented in British as in German universities. It is almost useless to expect that 
schools will do it justice until it is recognized at the universities, and scholarships 
and other inducements are open to those proficient in it.” 
This portion of the report closes with some extended and very. apt observations 
upon geography in the public services. The following extract seems very striking. 
It is from an address of Sir Charles Wilson, R. E., at the Dublin meeting of the 
British Association. Speaking of the essential need of a knowledge of geography 
to a military man, he said: 
“A commander entering upon a military campaign without such knowledge 
may be likened toa man groping in the dark. With it he may act with a bold- 
ness and decision that will often insure success. It was this class of knowledge, 
possessed in the highest degree by all great commanders, that enabled Jomini to 
foretell the collision of the French and Prussian armies at Jena in 1807, and in 
later years enabled a Prussian officer, when told that McMahon had marched 
northward from Chalsus, to point unerringly to Sedan as the place where a deci- 
sive battle would be fought. Chief Justice Daly, in his address to the American 
Geographical Society, draws attention to the Franco-German war as a ‘war 
fought as much by maps as by weapons,’ and attributes the results to skillful 
mnilitary movements, performed by an army thoroughly acquainted with all the 
geographical features of the country over which it was moved.” And he adds, 
“Tt teaches that if the fate of a nation may depend upon a battle, a battle may 
depend on a knowledge of geography.” 
The report as to Great Britain ends with the following: 
Except. then, in our elementary schools, in the high schools for girls, and in iso- 
lated middle-class schools, Professor Mosely’s statement still holds good; geogra- 
phy in this country is almost entirely neglected as a matter of education. An edu- 
cational authority, in writing to me, puts the situation very tersely, thus: (1) In 
universities it is nil. (2) In public schools very nearly nil, as the society’s exam- 
inations for their medals have proved. And when it is attempted, it is given to 
the most incompetent master, and he has a wretched set of maps. (38) It is 
required for the public services and taught, I do not know how, by crammers. 
(4) The only places where geography is systematically taught in England are the 
training colleges, male and female, and the national board schools; within the 
last few years some few good high and middle class schools. 
« Even with the time now allotted to it in our higher grade schools,” adds the 
inspector, ‘‘much more could be made of tie subject if the teachers themselves had. 
any real knowledge of it; had some training in the best methods of teaching it, 
and worked on a common programme intelligently constructed, so as to cover the 
whole field systematically, and had at their disposal such text-books, maps, and 
other apparatus as are almost universal on the Continent.” 
The progress made in the improvement of geographical instruction since this 
report was offered has been slight and it still describes substantially the condition 
of that study in England. At theSixth International Geographical Congress held 
in London, August, 1895,' it was frequently reiterated ‘‘That the treatment of 
geography as an educational subject in England was not as advanced as in some 
other countries.” At the same time it was recognized that the British geographical 
societies were making great efforts to put it upon a better footing, and the appre- 
ciation of those efforts was voiced in the following resolution: 
The attention of this International Congress having been drawn by the British 
members to the educational efforts being made by the British geographical socie- 
ties, the Congress desires to express its hearty sympathy with such efforts, and to 
1 Aninteresting accompaniment of this Congress, which was held in the Imperial Institute, was 
the exhibit of geographical appliances. This was arranged under five heads as follows: (1) 
Pictures, photographs and lantern slides; (2) historical collection; (3) various instruments and 
apparatus; (4) exhibits from various countries; (5) commercial exhibits. The next Congress 
will convene at Berlin, 1899,

place on record its opinion that in every country provision should be made for 
higher education in geography, either in the universities or otherwise. 
Turning to the continent of Europe, Mr. Keltie notes a marked contrast with 
Great Britain. In all these countries, education being more or less under control 
of the state, geography has a distinct place upon the programmes of schools and 
higher institutions. At the head of the list, undoubtedly, is Germany, although 
even there the standard is not yet as high as leading geographers desire to see it 
raised. This standard Mr. Keltie admits to be far beyond any his native coun- 
try has ever had sight of. Yet even in Germany there are differences among 
the several provinces in the amount of independence given to the subject, some 
putting it along with history on one basis of time, while in others these are sepa- 
rate and have each its own period. The establishment of chairs in the universi- 
ties has contributed to bring about uniformity. The most thorough instruction 
is given in elementary schools and those denominated Biirgerschulen, where the 
teachers have been trained in normal schools. 
Eminenitly noteworthy are the Heimatskunde, wherein it is indeed surprising 
how extensive and varied knowledge may be imparted to even young children by 
judicious training of teachers who have been made thoroughly competent in 
every particular. The inspector gives some very instructing accounts of several 
recitations which he attended. He relates an interview held with Dr. Finger, 
the inventor of the system, wherein he found that among other modes of instruc- 
tion teachers often took the pupils on excursions to the districts around the school, 
and even sometimes, as on holidays, on extended tours. ‘‘With their maps in 
their hands, they identify the leading features, become personally acquainted 
with cities, rivers, mining districts, minerals, and manufactories. This plan of 
making excursions, sometimes to a considerable distance and lasting for days, is 
carried out in Germany and France, and even in Spain.” 
In the matter of map reading, German schools are extremely painstaking, 
pupils being required over and over again to explain maps given for their use and 
to draw them themselves, often in outlines drawn upon the floor, using sand to 
build up the prominent features of a district to which their studies are at any 
time particularly devoted. 
The following programme the inspector subjoins, being taken from one of the 
high schools in Leipsic, which, he says, may be regarded as a fair representative of 
that class in Germany. To those not acquainted with the immense progress made 
within a few years in teaching geography, this programme, extending throughout 
nine years, might seem astonishing.

1480 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
The inspector remarks at considerable length on the methods employed by geog- 
raphy teaching in quite a number of schools into which he was admitted, where 
he was impressed by the little use made of text-books, for which lectures were 
substituted by their teachers, supported by maps and materials for present con- 
struction of them by himself and the class. Some of these recitations might well 
be included in this article if there were sufficient space. In all the higher schools 
geography holds its position on an even line with other subjects, and the certifi- 
cate awarded to a pupil upon leaving has equal dignity with one in Greek and 
Latin prose. 
In the German universities geography was slow in being admitted to its just 
rank, Down to 1873 the only chair was in the University of Berlin, which was 
held by Ritter. At the time when this report was made (1885) there were twelve, 
and another (at Minster) was to be established in that year. Holders of these 
chairs have equal rank with other professors, and receive the same salary. As to 
the University of Gottingen, the inspector was assured by Prof. H. Wagner that 
in examination for the degree of doctor of philosophy, geography ‘‘ has the same 
position and value as all the other subjects in the philosophical branch—languages, 
history, archeology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, zoology, geology, and bot- 
any. If geography is the principal subject in which the candidate wishes to obtain 
his doctorate, he is obliged to write a Boientific dissertation, which is printed, and 
which must show the progress of the science.’ 
A special degree, named Facultas Docendi, is for those who are qualifying them- 
selves especially for teaching the subject. For this a more than usually extensive 
course is undergone by candidates. 
The inspector dwells at considerable length on the courses of Professors Rein, 
Wagner, Clausius, Richthofen, Kirchoff, Kiepert, Partsch, and others. 
Of the Austrian universities, chairs of geography are in Vienna, Czernowitz, 
Graz, Innspruck, Prag, Budapest, Klausenburg, and Krakau. 
The subject, though extensively treated, is not up to the standard of Germany, 
being limited almost entirely to Europe and particularly devoted to Austria 
itself. In the schools, however, of all grades the subject ranks in all respects 
equal with Germany, except that in some it is connected too closely with history. 
The country is particularly rich in text-books, school wall maps, and atlases. The 
following is quoted from the inspector’s report concerning the Vienna Commer- 
cial Academy: 
Vienna possesses what is probably the leading commercial academy in the 
world; attended by about 900 students, many of them from foreign countries. 
Under Professor Zehden, geography forms one of the most important branches of 
instruction in the school, the course extending over three years. As in all the 
best schools in Germany and Austria, there is a special room for geographical 
apparatus. Here I found about 150 maps, all of the best class, including special 
maps from foreign countries. There are two sets of Hélzel’s Charakterbilder, 
both geographical and historical; Kirchoff’s Rassenbilder, besides hundreds of 
photos and engravings of cities, seaports, etc., Pick’s Tellurium, and other spe- 
cialties. 
The report for this country closes with an account of a visit to the Austrian 
cadet schools and the department of the general staff, the maps produced by the 
latter being ‘‘ celebrated the world over.” 
The report on France ascribes the immense development in the study of geog- 
raphy in that country mainly to efforts in its behalf by Professors Levasseur and 
Kimley. As a translation of portions of an extended pamphlet by the former is to 
appear hereafter in this chapter, we pass on. 
In Italy the subject is undergoing changes for the better, ia emulation of Ger- 
many, although there, as in Great Britain and most other countries, the primary 
schools give more attention to it than the higher. In that country the wall maps 
and atlases, prepared under the direction of Prof. Cavaliere Guido Cora, of Turin,
-P-A-G-E-353
  TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY ABROAD. 1481 
Professor malfatti, of Florence, and others, are equal to those in Germany, and 
the relief maps are the best in the world. Especial mention is made of the Tech- 
nical School of Alessandria, the Naval and Technical School of Genoa, and the 
Military School of Turin. High praise is accorded the ministry of education for 
its liberality in the supply of needed apparatus of every kind. Professors of geog- 
raphy are on the same footing as others are in the universities at Rome, Naples, 
Florence, Genoa, Bologna, Milan, Padua, Palermo, Pavia, Pisa, Venice, and Turin. 
In Switzerland, inasmuch as the separate cantons have themselves control of 
education, there is a difference in the degree of advancement of geography. It 
has made greatest progress in Zurich, Berne, and Basel. With the exception of 
Zurich, there are no professors in the universities. As elsewhere, it isin the lower 
schools that geography has most attention. The example of Germany is being 
imitated by Swiss teachers, who are doing everything possible to advance the sub- 
ject up to the standard of its more and more generally admitted importance. The 
system of cartography in general is on a high plane. 
In Belgium, although geographers are hopeful from the increasing interest 
taken in the subject, there is yet no professorship in any of the universities, 
Education being under the control of the State, progress is being made rapidly in 
the schools of all grades. 
Since Mr. Keltie’s report was submitted the new University of Brussels has ~ 
been founded (1894) and a chair of geography established, with M. Blisée Reclus 
as the incumbent. 
In Holland there is no professorship for geography in any of the universities, 
In a letter from Professor Kan, of Amsterdam, to the inspector he says: ‘‘ Physi- 
cal geography is taught in the faculty of mathematics and physics by the pro- 
fessor of physics; political geography in the faculty of literature and philosophy 
by the professor of history. The comparative value of geography in examinations 
is very little. In the schools that are regulated by the Government, geography 
has special courses more extensive in the lower than the higher. Schools are 
generally well supplied with maps and other apparatus. Particular attention is 
bestowed upon economic geography. In the University of Leyden is a professor- 
ship of the geography and ethnology of the Dutch East Indies.” 
In Sweden no professorship of geography is in either university, Upsula or 
Lund, The elements of political geography are taught by the professor of politi- 
cal science. Within a few years past this professor has given special lectures on 
the subject. It is taught with much care in the schools of all grades, 
In Spain, thanks to the work done by M. Levasseur in France, a very strong 
impluse has been given to geography. 
The inspector concludes his report upon the teaching of geography in the 
countries of Europe in the following words: 
Thus it is evident that geography has a serious place in education of all grades 
on the Continent, and that in Germany, Austria, France, Italy and Holland 
there are professors of the subject at certain of the universities. The Govern- 
ment of every country I have visited insists that it should be so, Geographical 
specialists complain that it has not in the higher schools the time allotted to it 
which it ought to have, and that there is a lack of properly trained teachers. 
The time, in my opinion, could not be much more than it is at present, and if the 
carefully arranged programmes are thoroughly carried out by competent men, 
boys ought to leave the higher continental schools with a very solid knowledge of 
geography, indeed. As to teachers, well-trained men—men who have taken the 
course and passed the examination for the Facultas Docendi in geography—are 
becoming commoner every year under the influence of the universities. In short, 
we find generally puceent in the continental systems of geographical instruction 
all the elements of development and success.

    1482 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
GEOGRAPHY IN THE SCHOOLS OF FRANCE. 
M. E. Levasseur, professor at the College of France and at the Conservatory of 
Artsand Trades, read a very ab‘e and interesting paper before the Sixth Inter- 
national Congress of Geography, held in London, July, 1895. The paper was sub- 
sequently published as a pamphlet,' and, through the courtesy of the author, has 
been placed at the disposal of the Commissioner of Education. Copious extracts 
are here presented. In the preface M. Levasseur says: 
  The manner of teaching geography varies according to the institution where 
instruction is given. It is not the same in primary, in secondary, and in higher 
schools. There are three degrees which it behooves to study separately. They do 
not all admit either the same matters or the same development in common mat- 
ters, nor the same method of exposition. Moreover, each of these degrees admits 
manifold gradations according to the general development of the pupils in culture 
and the kind of preparation in the institution; one could not give precisely the 
same instruction in a small school of a village as in alarge city; ina school in 
Paraguay as in one in Saxony. 
Inasmuch as two reporters have been appointed by the committee of organiza- 
tion to treat the subject, I shall not undertake to consider it in all its phases, soas 
to avoid confusion and repetition by taking points which M. Lehman wiil not dis- 
cuss. I shall, indeed, respond with more precision to the desire of the committee 
who have asked that study of me, and I shall render a better service to my col- 
leagues by devoting myself specially to the teaching of geography in France, and 
presenting some of my personal views in that behalf. 
As for the works in which I have endeavored to make known my sentiments on 
primary and secondary instruction, I refer the reader to the note on the method 
of teaching geography proposed by M. Levasseur, which I communicated to the 
Fifth International Congress of Geographic Science, at Berne. 
THE PRIMARY SCHOOL, 
Geography necessarily should figure in the whole programme of primary edu- 
cation. For it is important for every person to have some knowledge of the sub- 
ject, and a large majority of the inhabitants of a country, receiving instruction 
only therein, would suffer loss if the primary school failed to impart it. 
I maintain that next to the three fundamental branches—reading, writing, and 
arithmetic—history and geography are those most important in that instruction. 
In a report made in America under the name of a special committee, Mr. W. T. 
Harris, Commissioner of Education of the United States, places geography before 
history in rank of importance, because it imparts to the child practical, real 
knowledge which will be useful inlife. I cite the argument as having a certain 
value, but 1 am content myself to ask for equality in these two studies. 
The Maternal School (L’école maternelle).—Before the primary school should we 
make a place for geography in the maternal school, otherwise called kindergarten? 
A question to be left, in my opinion, to every directress of a school of that sort. 
If the directress judges that her children have understandings sufficiently 
developed to comprehend (their eyes on the globe) that there are lands and seas, 
that their country and their districts are situate somewhere on that globe, to the 
degree that they can take some interest in looking at those figures representing 
men—white, yellow, and black—mountains and valleys—she may inspire in them, 
by amusing them, an incipient desire to know geography. 
But one must guard against general rules and impose nothing asa task. One 
does not gain time in undertaking to give notions of geography to children before 
the age of 6 or 7 years, which in general is that of entrance to the primary school, 
Geography, so named, has no place in the maternal school. 
TWO METHODS PROPOSED FOR BEGINNING INSTRUCTION IN GEOGRAPHY, 
Even in the primary school geography should not be admitted until the pupil 
has learned sufficiently to read and write. Instruction therein should be very 
simple, clear, methodical, and demonstrative, and, as far as possible, it also should 
be regulated by a method, uniform in all schools, of the same degree in the same 
country.

-P-A-G-E-355
TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY ABROAD. 1483 
Two methods present themselves to lead beginners into the first principles—the 
commune (or particular) and the earth (or general) methods. I much prefer the 
former, but I believe that it would be an error to adhere in a manner exclusive or 
too long to either. 
The first programme of special secondary instruction fell into that mistake when, 
under the title of ‘‘Summary study of France,” which should be made in the pre- 
paratory year, it was prescribed not only to begin with the department in which 
the school was located, but to continue with neighboring departments and proceed, 
successively, throughout all the departments of France. Such sequence is not 
one of order. It could not but make confusion in the memory of pupils, because 
particular features do not attach themselves to every general plan, If description 
of the locality interest the child, it is mainly because he knows it before the 
teacher has described it to him; but when it comes toregions that he has never seen, 
or which are in no wise connected with those which he has seen, it profits him lit- 
tle to speak about a place situated 50 or 500 kilometers distant. 
PLAN OF THE CLASS—STUDY OF THE COMMUNES AND DEFINITIONS, 
This is why I have never ceased during thirty years to advise that the first place 
should be given to the study of the commune, whose territory is familiar to the 
pupil, especially if it is rural, and even to begin before the commune with the 
class and the school. I have given an example of the method in a series of small 
departmental geographies, the first of which (Seine-et-Oise) I composed myself, 
and the others were prepared by different authors on the same plan and under my 
direction. The Germans, long before, employed a similar method. The Ameri- 
cans and other peoples use it often. 
It is easy to publish a departmental geography. It is not easy to find an editor 
who will undertake the publication of the geography of a commune unless it be of 
a large city, because the sale of the volume will be too small. We must therefore 
trust for that instruction almost entirely to the good will and the tact of the 
teacher, giving to him, however, some directions. 
Of what use is description of the school? Merely to make the new pupil learn 
how to draw a map of any place on paper or a blackboard, and recognize the right, 
the left, direction in general, and give to hirn a first idea of position. 
A child having well gotten that idea will be able promptly to read a map. 
Why the commune? To attain the same end and to impart to pupils, with help 
of experience, the idea of essential definitions. On the bank of a stream they can 
easily be made to understand the course of a river, the right bank, the left, and 
even the basin; on rising ground, they will perceive with their own eyes a water- 
shed, a ridge, a chain; the sight of things will keep up their attention and fix in 
memory the definition which, isolated, nad been arid to them and unintelligible. 
Without doubt such sight is not enough; there are names and definitions which 
they must learn by heart; but, as often as possible, they must be shown the thing 
itself in order to be assisted in retaining the name. Thus learned with help of 
their eyes, definitions will be fixed in the memory in a way more rational and 
more enduring. Soin this connection, with some modification, one might apply 
the proposition of Liebnitz, Nihil debet esse in memoria quod non prius fuerit in 
intellectu. 
In some of the geographical text-books assigned for primary instruction, princi- 
pally in the Elementary Atlas, | have employed that method, while essaying to join 
with it some general ideas of the earth and geographical definitions. Not being 
able to put before children examples from nature—that is, for the master alone, 
whose business it is—I at least keep from giving any definitions without accom- 
panying the text with an image, in order to set it before the eyes of the pupils, 
and I have advised teachers to complete such images with realities. This is what 
is done now by almost all writers of books of this kind everywhere. 
There is hardly any commune which has not a water course and some variations 
of ground which the teacher can cite in illustration of his images. If there are 
none, he can figure them with sand arranged in a large box. 
Thave often repeated that the smallest phenomenon in nature can furnish com- 
parisons which every intelligent teacher will know how to employ. For example, 
if a thunderstorm arises, the playground of the school is marked off with streams 
of water which form confluences, islands, deltas. It is by familiar examples of 
pe kind, by images, and oft-repeated questionings, that initiation into the study 
is begun, . : 
 
-P-A-G-E-356
  1484 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896 97. 
USE OF THE GLOBE FOR IMPARTING FIRST NOTIONS OF THE EARTH. 
One of the consequences of this method is employment of the globe in beginning 
lessons on the earth. A child of 8 years is incapable of understanding a plani- 
sphere—that is, to transform mentally in one sphere two circles or a quadrilateral 
drawn upon a plane surface. Even many adults hardly conceive the true form 
from that deformed image. With the terrestrial globe in his hand the teacher 
should say, ‘‘Here is the earth. Itisaball. See the place upon it that your coun- 
try occupies.” Then, with finger on this globe, he gives the first lessons on oceans 
and continents. When, after a time, the pupil’s eyes have become familiar with 
the rotundity of the earth, he can explain to him summarily how outlines are 
reproduced upon paper and place a map before his eyes. 
At what stage should the globe begin to be used? Opinions vary. My own is 
that the teacher will use it most advantageously as soon as his pupils have learned 
definitions by the study of the commune. 
That double study, the commune and the globe, suffices for the first course of 
instruction in geography, whose only object is to open the pupil’s intelligence to 
geographic ideas. Make one see in order to make him understand. 
THE MIDDLE COURSE.! 
With the middle course begins the study of geography, properly so called. It 
should be devoted particularly to one’s country. Every child has need to know 
his country and learn to love it. Tothat end, the master ina Frenchschoolshould 
go over definitions, taking care always to accompany with examples suitable for 
making them understood. In every lesson he will explain what the earth is and 
what Europe is on the earth just enough tomake them comprehend what in Europe 
is France. Then he willaddress himself to the study of France, giving the greater 
part of his time to physical geography and ending with the departments and a 
simple enumeration of colonial possessions. 
In many French primary schools each year is doubled; that is to say, the pupil, 
unless he has been found very intelligent, pursues for two successive years the same 
matters, and alarge majority of pupils learn twice the same course—a good method, 
because things should be repeated in order to be fixed in the memories of children. 
Moreover, each course should be in some sort a development from its preceding, 
with review of things already understood and addition of new. 
HIGHER COURSE, 
The higher course, which pupils follow also two years, comprises, besides a rapid 
revision of definitions and elementary notions of cosmography, a return to the 
geography of France, with some new details, afterwards the study, physical and 
political, of Europe, a very summary study of other parts of the world, witha 
little more of development, however, for very important nations, as the United 
States and the colonial possessions of France. It is important that a pupil get 
precise acquaintance—I do not mean detail—with those colonies which he will 
come before long to regard an important part of his own country. He will thus 
become more familiarized with that idea and be better disposed, if he should have 
a position, to go there without considering himself expatriated. 
Here follows an extended official programme of the primary schools. Then 
comes the method of instruction, in which the author refers to some of his own 
previous observations given before a conference of teachers at the Sorbonne? on 
the occasion of the World’s Exposition in Paris in 1878, in which he lays much 
stress upon the importance of utmost precision in instruction, yet with caution 
against unnecessary multiplication of details. Learn a title; learn that well, is 
with him a favorite maxim. 
REASON AND CONNECTION OF GEOGRAPHIC PHENOMENA. 
After several paragraphs discussing minutely but with much interest the value 
of atlases, wall maps, and blackboards with outlines of maps, M. Levasseur con- 
siders the means of imparting notions of the causes and relations of phenomena. 
  
1The primary school of France comprises three grades—elementary, middle, and higher.

    TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY ABROAD. 1485 
Alluding to an example in a note given by him regarding the importance ofa wall 
map in which the varying courses of the Rhone are depicted, he says: 
By this example it was seen that I endeavored to show, as far as possible, the 
reason for everything. It is of little importance that a child shall know all the 
windings of the Garonne, but when once he has understood how the Garonne 
flows at first toward the north by reason of the slope in the region of the Pyrenees, 
then turns to the northwest because of the obstacle of the central mass, he will 
have a notion of it reasoned out that he will never be able to efface from his mem- 
ory. The same with the Rhone and the bend it makes suddenly at Lyons before 
the Cevennes, the same of the Loire, and the bend it makes between Nevers and 
Blois. 
For understanding the movement of waters one must have, first, acquaintance 
with relief. For this reason I am not in favor of the method which consists in 
teaching geography by isolated basins. This can be done with profit in a higher 
course, but on conditions that pupils already have an idea of the ‘‘ensemble” of 
relief masses, This is why it is desirable to commence by the special study of the 
relief of the ground, and it is well to make that study with the aid of a hypso- 
metric chart. When, twenty years ago, I attempted to introduce that kind of 
chart in this instruction, it was objected that the children were not capable of 
understanding it. In reality they are, and it is not more difficult for them to dis- 
tinguish by colors, grounds—low, medium, and high—than to figure to themselves 
chains of mountains by hatchings. These hatchings, when they indicate nothing 
except a ridge, delude by giving the impression that the chains are like walls. If 
they assume to indicate everything on an elementary chart, as on a topographic, 
they become confusing. The very simple hypsometric tints, completed, as 
required, by touches at the bottom and on the side of the chart, have not that 
defect, and allow a durable impression of the general relief of the region. Hyp- 
sometry is as desirable for a wall chart as for the maps in an atlas. 
CHARTS IN RELIEF. 
It is for the purpose of giving to children the first ideas of the form of the ground 
that charts in relief are recommended. They were a part of my method, and 
from the beginning I included them in the works undertaken by me for practical 
application. To be of service it is not enough to have relief; the relief should be 
exact. 
I oppose globes in relief because, however large they are, any relief is such an 
exaggeration that it imparts a false idea of the relations of mountains with the 
general surface of the earth. On one of the two globes which I had had put up, 
the elementary globe, which is on a scale of 40,000,000 (1 meter in circumference), 
I marked with a small brass nail the relative altitude of Goarsankar, The nail 
did not project one-fourth of a millimeter. 
If charts in relief are local, serving for the study of the commune, it is very 
desirable that the geographer (in this case often the teacher himself) should use 
the same scale for heights and distances, so as not to alter the angles of the slope. 
But if the charts present an extensive region, as France, it is necessary to exag- 
gerate heights soas to make them sensible to theeye; still, the exaggeration should 
be as slight as possible. On my relief chart of France it sufficed to take a vertical 
scale, a quadruple of the horizontal, in order to show important variations in the 
ground. Besides, the appearance of relief slightly exaggerated does not deceive 
as much as one would suppose, because in reality we look at mountains from the 
bottom upward, while on the chart we regard them from tue summit downward. 
CLASS BOOKS. 
In primary schools they use manuals, atlases, and text-books. The manual, com- 
prising questions and answers, as composed by the Abbé Gautier, has the defect 
of relieving the teacher from personal effort, in relying too exclusively on the 
pupil’smemory. The text-atlas—that is to say, the book containing both text and 
map in juxtaposition, so that the pupil has not to turn the page (a process which 
detracts from its utility)—appears to me preferable, and is now generally preferred 
in France; those of M. Foncin are so especially. They have long been in use, but 
itis hardly more than twenty-five years since attempts have been made to get 
them up in a rational manner and with careful topography. 
The publications of M. A. Guyot, which have done much to change the study 
of geography in the United States, suggested my first text atlas twenty years 
ago...

  1486 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
In teaching geography in the primary school, material is of much importance, 
but the teacher of yet more importance. To apply the method I have recom- 
mended, as I have said elsewhere, ‘‘it is necessary for the teacher to perform his 
own part, drawing from himself some of his explanations, inventing means of 
demonstration, and being always ready to answer the pupil’s questions.” I 
ended the conference of 1878 in saying to the teachers that ‘* certainly they should 
prefer to make a lesson profitab!e rather than remain bound to nomenclature; that 
they should make the book serve them rather than become its servant.” This 
counsel it is well to repeat. To put it better in practice, teachers must not only 
be zealous but well prepared. It is in the normal school where geography has 
made such notable progress during twenty-five years that such preparation is the 
most surely obtained. 
M. Levasseur then proceeds to consider tne schools of secondary grade (lycées 
and communal colleges). Passing over the general description of these which 
has been given quite fully in previous reports of this Office,| we present here, 
first, the programmes of geography which obtained from 1865 to 1890, and follow- 
ing this tabular view the author’s discussion of particular topics and statement as 
to the professors in charge of the subject:

1488 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
The development of the subject from 1874 to 1880 was due to the work of a spe- 
cial commission appointed in 1871 by Jules Simon, minister of public instruction, 
of which commission M. Levasseur was the secretary. Of the revisions in the 
programme which have taken place since 1880 M. Levasseur says: ‘‘The text has 
been abridged for the purpose of simplifying the instruction, which is desirable. 
The distribution of the subjects has beenchanged, . . . but on the whole the spirit 
of the reform of 1872 has been maintained, and substantially the order of topics.” 
The programmes of special secondary instruction, now changed to modern sec- 
ondary, are also discussed in detail, and regret is expressed that since 1890 these 
have become, so far as regards geography, identical with those of the classical 
course, whereas formerly the subject was much more extended in this division of 
the lycée. 
THE GEOLOGICAL FORMATION OF LAND. 
The geological formation of lands, a study which until the reforms of 1872 had 
no place in geographic programmes, ought to be presented in a very summary 
way, simply to the degree necessary for assisting the pupil in ‘‘retaining more 
easily the impression of an orographic system of which he will have the secret.” 
The relief of the land studied, not as formerly in France by the enumeration of 
chains and mountains, but by description of the undulations of the country, cor- 
rugations, crests, table-lands, plains, valleys, in a manner to give a precise idea of 
the form of land, With more or less of details according to the case; the régime of 
waters, whose courses are explained by this relief of the soil, as the climate explains 
the formation and as geology by its help makes us comprehend absorption or con- 
tinuous flow; the sea and the shores; the climate, the study of which, as it seems 
to me, should be placed at the end of physical geography rather than the beginning, 
because, although it may be the principal cause of the régime of waters, it is due 
itself in great degree to the height of mountains, to the situation and geologic 
constitution of the soil, also to its degree of proximity to the great masses of 
waters. These are the four parts of physical geography in the programmes. Polit- 
ical geography comes next, comprising historical geography—that is, the formation 
of States; and administrative geography—that is, their principal boundaries (cir- 
cumscription), with some knowledge of their governments and the composition of 
their interior administration. Under the name of economic geography are com- 
prised population (territorial density, increase) ,studied principally in its relations 
to the soil; agriculture, with amount of principal products of such region and their 
relation with soil and climate; mineral productions, and their relation to geolog- 
ical constitution; manufactures, outlined by some essential particulars and con- 
sidered principally in their relation with agriculture; and mines, which contribute 
raw materials, and the population that use the products; ways of communication 
by water and land, whose outline is caused by the water systems, the relief of the 
soil, and the needs of the people; commerce, which, utilizing these ways, places the 
products of agriculture, mineral and manufacturing industry within reach of the 
people and creates currents of exchange between nations. 
These various parts of instruction constitute the three groups of geography— 
physical, political, and economic. Economic geography existed not in name nor 
in fact, so to speak, in the schools of France before 1865. I congratulate myself 
on having introduced it in fact in the programme of secondary special instruction 
in 1866 and in name as well as in fact in the programme of classical instruction 
in 1872. If it is of advantage anywhere, it seems to me to have a special value in 
the former of these two courses, and, as I have said before, ought to have more 
development therein than elsewhere. 
These different divisions of geography are only separate members of one and the 
same science. It is needful to bring together these members in order to give unity 
and life to the body, to find the links that bind all together in order to rise toa 
just conception of general harmony. 
The author appends in this place extracts from a paper upon the subject read 
before the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences in 1871. This is followed by 
elaborate lists of programmes of various classes during several years, and some 
very thoughtful observations upon the use of blackboards and outline maps. We 
translate what is said about the professors of geography.

  TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY ABROAD. 1489 
PROFESSORS OF GEOGRAPHY. 
In the secondary schools of France the teaching of geography is intrusted to a 
professor of history and geography. 
Some of the particular friends of geography have asked, and they yet ask, that 
geography be assigned to a special professor; that an examination (agrégation) 
in geography be established, and, at the superior normal school, a section of geog- 
raphy to prepare for this examination. In support of these claims they offer 
some arguments that are impressive, though not entirely conclusive. They urge, 
for example, that certain scientific or economic knowledge is necessary for the 
geographer but superfluous for the historian. Their views appear to have been 
regarded with little favor. Doubtless, in some large lycées, it might be advanta- 
geous to intrust classes in geography to one professor, but in small establishments 
this would be impracticable. 
On the other side, many teachers, like myself, think that in specializing too much 
the work of the teachers in secondary schools there is danger of narrowing their 
horizon and perhaps of pushing instruction into needless detail. In the primary 
school one teacher gives the whole of the instruction; in the chairs of higher 
instruction specialization becomes necessary; but secondary schools occupy an 
intermediary position. Now, between history and geography there are relations 
sufficiently close to prevent the one from being incompatible with the other. It 
is not more difficult to acquire the special knowledge which topography, drawing 
of charts, etc., require than that required for the understanding of chronology or 
the reading of ancient manuscripts. 
Professors of history and geography ought to be furnished with diplomas that 
attest their capacity. The first is a licentiate in history; the second, which is the 
definitive sanction of a professorship, is the ‘‘agrégation.” The licentiate is an 
examination which candidates already possessed of the bachelor degree undergo 
before the faculty of letters, before whom ordinarily they are not prepared to 
present themselves until after two years of special studies, The agrégation isa 
very difficult examination, which is held every year before a jury appointed by 
the minister. In order to be admitted to this the applicant must be a licentiate. 
The examination for the title of agrégé since 1895 has been modified and divided 
into two series of trials. The first, consisting of a thesis, explanation of a text, les- 
son, and discussion, is held before the professors of the faculty under whom the 
candidate has studied; the second, freed from these preliminaries, takes place 
before a special jury. 
Candidates for ‘‘licentiate” and “agrégation” prepare themselves—the former 
in the superior normal school, which they enter only by competitive examination; 
the latter in the faculties, where ‘‘ bourses” are bestowed on the most deserving. 
In the primary school it is well for teachers to follow strictly the official pro- 
gramme and conform themselves as muchas possible to the prescribed method. In 
the secondary it is desirable to leave more of initiative to professors, whilst requir- 
ing of them to cover their programme. We must not confine them by too minute 
rules, as I have said, in agreement with my friend M. Himly, in submitting to the 
minister the project of the programmes for 1872. According to the nature of his 
own mind and the degree of advancement of his pupils the teacher should be able 
to insist on such or such a portion, so as to make more prominent those which 
seem to him more likely to excite interest and to group them as he judges best. 
It is important that geography be known, and to that end it behooves that instruc- 
tion in it have variety and movement, so that both teachers and pupils can find it 
attractive. Now, it is in leaving to the teacher full liberty to exert himself within 
therequirements of a general plan and to manage details as he sees fit that instruc- 
tion becomes attractive. The only point on which the administration and inspec- 
tion should show themselves exacting is that of results. 
The pamphlet of M. Levasseur concludes with higher instruction, all of which, 
with the exception of programme and some of the notes, is given in full. 
HIGHER EDUCATION. 
In France higher education is divided between faculties and special establish- 
ments.

  1490 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
FACULTIES AND SPECIAL SCHOOLS OF FRANCE, 
The chairs of geography belong to the faculty of letters. At this time (1895) 
there is a chair at Bordeaux, at Lille, Lyons, and Nancy.! There is a course at 
Caen,a complementary course at Aix and at Grenoble, a teacher (master of confér- 
ences) at Montpellier and Toulouse, a chair of history and geography of modern 
times at Besancon, and a chair of history and geography, of antiquity and of the 
Middle Age at Clermont. At the higher school of Algiers a course is maintained 
in the geography of Africa. 
The faculty of letters at Paris comprises a chair of geography. founded in 1809, 
the first and only one that existed for a long time,’ and one-of colonial geogra- 
phy founded in 1892. 
From these chairs has resulted a sort of “‘seminary” or ‘‘laboratory,” founded 
in 1890, and reserved for students of the faculty who have a special vocation for 
geography. In the class rooms of geography they find facilities for their work and 
directions for their studies. Since 1895 a scientific bureau of colonial studies has 
been annexed, under the direction of a professor of colonial geography and his assist- 
ant, the secretary. The students who there prepare for the “agrégation,” if not by 
the regulations, at least by the tradition of teachers, must follow the course for at 
least four years, two for licentiate in historico-geography and two for the “‘ agré- 
gation.” 
There is, besides, a course of physical geography annexed to the faculty of sci- 
ences in Paris; at Lyons and at Nancy the professor of geography of the faculty 
of science makes a complementary course or a “conference” of physical geogra- 
hy. At Lyons a professor has special charge of a course in ethnology. At 
Nancy, for the young men who are preparing for ‘‘agrégation,” have been lately 
established four courses of geography in the faculty of sciences, besides special 
lessons by the professor of geography of the faculty of letters. 
The free faculty of Paris has a course of physical geography by M. de Lappar- 
ent, professor of geology. That of Tulle has one course, and the preparatory 
schools of Nantes and Rouen one each, 
Geography has close connections with the. sciences, hence professors of science 
may properly teach it. In the general report on the teaching of history and geog- 
raphy, which my colleague, M. Himly, and myself made to the minister of public 
instruction in 1871, we asked that a chair in geography should be added to the fac- 
ulties in the provinces, as it has been since 1809 in the faculty of letters in Paris 
(Ihave already said that at that time there were no others) ; that meanwhile the 
minister should favor the opening of annexed courses, municipal or free, and 
would endow faculties, whenever the professors would request it, with funds suf- 
ficient for geographic instruction. We were of the opinion also that some of the 
professors of sciences could undertake the new instruction. and that it would be 
desirable to induce the professors of history to make a place for geography in their 
courses. On that last point I think we were mistaken. In higher instruction only 
specialization, which does not mean narrowness in general knowledge and concep- 
tion, is fruitful. 
In explaining the production and the shape of land the geologists can open wide 
prospect to the science of geography, but geology does not cover all the secrets 
and all the riches of that science. Meteorology, botany, zoology, topography, 
hydrography, have much to impart, not counting mathematics. The master’s 
diversity of aptitudes makes for the advantage of science. Even in the faculty of 
letters I am far from regretting that geography is in the hands of the professors of 
history. I have said that I should not advise their separation, but in higher 
instruction I would rather distrust such association, because, while the professor 
himself might be a specialist in both kinds, time would be lacking for the teach- 
ing of both. One is probably sacrificed for the other, and generally that is geog- 
raphy. 
    
  1 The subj treated for several years by M. Auerbach, professor of the college of Nancy, 
are as follows: The Lorraine region, the central plateau, the Loire, French colonies in the nine 
teenth century, the ethnography of eastern Europe, the United States, Australia, the colonization 
in Oceanica. The pro! or also devotes a portion of his lessons toa general review of geogra- 
phy. This year he has established a small special class to prepare for the “ agrégation,” in which e has studied with his pupils the geographic distribution of the population of France, and the 
altitude, relief, and character of the soil. 
2 It should be noted, however, that M. Ouvré, professor of the Tenney, of letters at Aix, pre- 
sented a course of commercial geography at Marseilles at the expense of the Chamber of Com: 
merce, and at Nancy, M. Pingaud, professor at the lycée, a special course of geography at the 
faculty of letters.

TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY ABROAD. 1491 
The College of France has two chairs devoted, at least in part, to geography— 
the chair of geography, history, and economic statistics. and that of the historical 
geography of France. 
At the Practical School of Higher Studies, M. Longnon presents a course in the 
historical geography of France. At the Museum of Natural History several 
courses, without including geography by name, treat of matters connected with 
it and in such a manner that often and with great profit to the hearers they enter 
upon the very domain of geography. Moreover, the director of the museum has 
instituted, for the benefit of travelers and outside of the ordinary courses, special 
lectures bearing on geography exclusively. 
I mention only the principal special schools in which geography is taught. 
At the Superior Normal School, where the students, admitted through compe- 
tition, pass three years in preparing for a professorship and offer themselves for 
the ‘‘agrégation”’ at their graduation, proficiency in geography is required of those 
who are aiming for a fellowship in history and geography. It is in the second 
year that they begin specialization. which is complete at the beginning of the 
third. There are three ‘‘ conferences” in geography a week, each of an hour and 
akalf. Only one of these is common to students of the second and third year. 
The professor, in the round of two years, treats the principal subject of general 
geography and of method. Occasionally place is made there for a lesson by a 
student or for the examination of a thesis written on a subject assigned several 
months before. The two other ‘‘conferences” are only for students of the third 
year and are made up of exercises in common. 
One of the class, for twenty minutes or three-quarters of an hour, according 
to the nature of the question, discusses a subject that has been assigned to him 
several days beforehand. The professor briefly criticises the paper. The rest of 
the conference is spent in discussion or in the exchange of ideas on the subject. 
As the number of pupils is, on an average, not one-half dozen, all may take part. 
At the Normal School of Sévres, which prepares women teachers for secondary 
instruction, there are some special ‘‘ conferences” in geography. At the school of 
St. Cyr and the higher military school, pupils pursue the course of military geog- 
raphy and undergo examinations. The Free School of Political Sciences has a 
regular course of commercial and statistical geography,’ of geography azd 
ethnography, and some optional courses in geograpby and military organization, 
and of the geography of the extreme Orient. The colonial school has some courses 
relating to geography. The School of Oriental Languages has a course in the 
geography. history, and legislation of the extreme Orient. The school of advanced 
commercial studies has a course in economic geography, as have also the higher 
commercial schools. : 
At the National Agronomic Institute the course of comparative agriculture, 
founded by the professor on a thorough study of climatology and geology, has a 
pronounced character of economic geography. 
    
  CHARACTER OF HIGHER INSTRUCTIO: 
  Jn higher instruction it would not suit to have either a common programme or 
uniform method. Each professor has his own special mission. 
In the greater number of special schools, such as the superior normal school, for 
example, students are prepared for a set examination, and to that end they must

follow a certain programme, although in general not bound to study every matter 
contained in it. In the faculties they are more free to choose their subjects, 
although they must regulate the same according to the preparation for the licen- 
tiate or the “agrégation.” 
At the College of France the student is entirely free, and every year, with the 
approbation of all the professors, he makes his own choice of studies in the course. 
In 1894-95 M. Longnon, professor of historic geography of France, taught the 
description of the two Aquitaines and ‘‘Novempopulanie” at the decline of the 
Roman period. In my course on geography, history, and economic statistics I 
have treated of the economic development of the United States (agriculture and 
mines),! 
In the special schools there are none but students; in the faculties there are both 
students and hearers. At the College of France, whose courses do not have any 
examination, there are simply hearers (that is, those who attend the lectures). 
The value of a course of superior instruction depends entirely on the culture 
and the capacity of the teacher. Hence there is nothing to prescribe as to the 
manner of proceeding. To advance science, to extend the knowledge of it, and to 
create a taste for it, such is the end; to interest by instructing is what should 
be recommended; but it pertains to the teacher alone to find the means of success, 
and he must be left free in his action. 
As in secondary instruction, it is important that the professor have a good 
supply of wall maps and blackboards. 
If the professor has only hearers, it is by public lectures that he exercises his 
scientific influence, supplementing his lectures by special instructions for those 
who ask this help. If he has pupils, it is necessary not only to teach by lectures, 
but incite them to work themselves, and to direct their work, giving them now 
and then subjects to treat and showing them how to make researches, how to 
study a question, and how to explain it in oral and written terms. 
PUBLICATIONS, LIBRARIES, AND GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETIES, 
Scientific publications, journals, reviews, books, and geographical societies con- 
tribute to develop a taste for the study and popularize it; this is one way of 
instruction. 
To say nothing of political journals, some of which often contain interesting 
information, I will mention among those periodicals specially consecrated to geog- 
raphy in France, Annales de Géographie, a recent quarterly publication; La Revue 
de Géographie, a monthly which has been in existence nineteen years; L’Annuaire 
du club alpin, the Bulletins of the society of geography, and the Society of com- 
mercial geography of Paris, also those of the provinces; the Bulletin of the Com- 
mittee of French-Africa; Le Tour du Monde, Le Journal des Voyages. a very 
popular publication; Le Moniteur Officiel du Commerce, La Revue Maritime et 
Coloniale, La Revue Internationale de Géographie, La Topographie, etc. 
Among the societies are La Société de géographie at Paris, the oldest of its 
kind; La Société de géographie commerciale de Paris, Le Club Alpin, La Société 
Africaine, La Société des Etudes Coloniales, La Société de Topographie, La Société 
indochinoise, La Société géographie de Marseille, La Société de géographie com- 
merciale de Bordeaux, La Société de géographie de Lyon, La Société Normande

The committee of historical and scientific works in the ministry of public 
instruction, one of whose functions is to serve as a means of maintaining the 
union between Societies of Savants, comprises five sections, one of which is that 
of historical and descriptive geography. 
Several of the ministries contribute by their publications to the development of 
the geographic sciences—the ministry of public instruction through the commit- 
tee of historical and scientific works, the ministry of war through the geographic 
service of the army, which is charged with keeping up to date the military map 
of the French staff, which is on a scale of zyhy,5, and the whole cartographic work 
of the ministry; the ministry of marine through the depot of marine charts and 
plans; the ministry of the interior through the preparation of a map on a scale of 
zo0o00 Of a meter; the ministry of public works through the publication of its 
map (scale goj/gn7, unfinished), and a graphic album of statistics, ete. The min- 
istry of foreign affairs has some very valuable cartographic archives. The minis- 
try of the colonies has recently created a geographic service, the direction of 
which has been assigned to a fellow (agrégé) in history and geography. Inde- 
pendently of the cartographic riches possessed by general libraries, especially the 
national library, which has a very valuable department of geography, there are 
several libraries specially devoted to geography that, with more or less liberality, 
are open tothe public: The Library of the Society ot Geography, that of the Society 
of Commercial Geography, of the Depository of Marine Charts, of the Higher 
Military School, of the Superior Normal School, the library of the Sorbonne, etc. 
EFFORTS TO PROMOTE GEOGRAPHICAL STUDY iN AUSTRALIA. 
It is interesting to note in this connection efforts to promote geographical study 
in British colonies. The Royal Geographical Society of Australasia has been active 
in this respect. The Queensland branch of this society effected a relation with 
the Brisbane Technical College in 1894, by which a class in commercial geography 
was established at the Brisbane Technical College under the auspices of the society. 
The initiation and conduct of the movement was intrusted to Mr. J. P. Thomson, 
at the time the honorable secretary of the society, and subsequently elected to the 
presidency. Mr. Thomson has been indefatigable in the endeavor to promote 
interest in this subject. He has also greatly assisted by his researches, and pub- 
lished works to increase the actual knowledge of the geography of Australia. In 
common with other authorities cited in this chapter, he urges the special impor- 
tance of teaching children the geography of their native land. In his presidential 
address! delivered at the anniversary meeting of the Geographical Society in 1895, 
he said: 
It is not to our credit as a people that while our school children are crammed 
with what after all is only a superficial and inadequate knowledge of all other 
parts of the world, little attention is given to our own country, to our industries, 
or to our natural and artificial resources. To the credit, be it said, of a public- 
spirited journal, the subject of our national industries has recently received special 
treatment, and it is hoped the Courier, to which I particularly refer, will devote 
equal time and attention to other phases of our partially, or wholly, undeveloped 
resources. ‘

CHAPTER XXXI. 
CONSULAR REPORTS ON EDUCATIONAL TOPIC 
  [This Bureau is indebted to the State Department for documents on educational 
topics sent by United States consuls in various countries. Some of these docu- 
ments deserve publication in their entirety; others refer to educational measures 
in foreign countries as causes of conditions observed. Many of such references 
appear to be of importance; hence excerpts have been made and are here inserted. ] 
RECENT PROGRESS IN Rvssta,! 
Report of Mr. Tuomas Sarrrn, vice and acting consul at Moscow, Russia. 
During the last two years the columns of our papers and journals have been 
enlivened with discussions as to the requirements of our education. Sometimes 
they speak of the deficiency of our national and elementary schools, and sometimes 
of the necessity of reforming the gymnasium and realistic schools, and finally the 
universities. In the commencement of 1897 much was written concerning the 
necessity of reforming the universities; during the autumn the question was raised 
regarding the remuneration and salaries of professors, then the question of tech- 
nical schools and technical faculties. Everywhere and in everything is noticed a 
desire for progress, and a thirst for reform shows itself. The desire appears not 
only in Russian society, but, what is more, ithas taken hold of Government spheres. 
In nearly all departments the work is going on. Wherever the Government con- 
cernsitself with the problem of the education of the Russian people—the education 
of the lower, middle, and higher classes—permanant and temporary commissions 
are at work. The problem of education has become a problem of reform. 
But something unaccountable is putting on a drag in the matter of reform. 
They talk a great deal, but without arriving at any result. They begin to talk 
from a new point of view, and, as it were, of other things; and again, although 
the subject is always the same—i. e., the reform in education—nothing comes of 
it. The whole consists of only ideas and wise and good plans, but the matter 
remains immovable. There is a reason, it must appear, in every natural and 
general manifestation, though we do not see it; but the reason in this instance is 
avery ordinary one. In fact, we are told—and it is constantly repeated to us— 
that we have no money. Weall wish for reforms; we acknowledge their necessity 
and importance. We require both national education and reforms of the middle 
schools, and augmentation of the budgets of the university, and the extension of 
technical education; but we have no money. 
Here unwilling doubts ari On the one hand financial estimates with a large 
surplus, the brilliant exhibition in Nijni Novgorod, the exchange of paper cur- 
rency for gold and silver, and much more make one think that we are rich; on the 
other hand, it appears that we are poor, that almost nothing more can be under- 
taken for the spreading and perfection of education in Russia. Are we rich or 
poor?

1496 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
In deciding this question, society is at a loss; but, allowing that we are neither 
rich nor poor, but that the State, people, and society are possessed of fair means, 
what do we do? Outof the more than a billion budget, we spend 20,000,000 rubles 
($10,280,000) ,1 2 per cent, on national education. Admitting that other depart- 
ments in line with the ministry of national education expend on schools and edu- 
cation another 20,000,000 rubles (besides the budget of the ministry of national 
education), and that the State expends altogether nearly 4 per cent of its budget, 
is such a condition normal? We shall not compare these figures with the expen- 
ditures of other Governments; the comparison would be too unprofitable for 
Russia. Let us examine the matter as it is, in connection with the condition of 
-our Fatherland and of Russian society. We require a low medium instruction 
and higher education in a much larger measure and proportion than actually 
exist. Everyone agrees with this contention; but let us only verify this condition 
from a general point of view. The State spends on the needs of education about 
4 per cent of its budget; how much does society itself expend on it? 
Let us take the middle class of our population, a class of people possessing 
means, but not rich. The income of this class amounts to from 1,000 to 5,000 
rubles ($514 to $2,570) per annum. Of course the matter concerns the people with 
families, . . . where there are three or four children (the usual number in a middle- 
class family). The outlay on the-education of the children fluctuates between 300 
and 700 rubles ($154 and $359) per annum. It is beyond doubt that a Russian 
family spends on the education of its children (each one of us will find sufficient 
confirmation of this) from 10 to 20 per cent of its annual income. The State 
expends on education 4 per cent; a family 10 or 20 per cent of its budget. But up 
to the present, we have been speaking of the middle class of society. Ifwe hadin 
view the people and the lower classes, it would appear that with 4 per cent of 
their income, the peasant and artisan could not pay for the most elementary edu- 
cation of their children; consequently, the education of the people must be almost 
gratis. For this purpose, must be taken at least one-half of the 20,000,000 rubles 
($10,280,000) budget of the ministry of national education. Certainly, we have 
rich people who spend on the education of their children less than 10 per cent, 
and even less than 4 per cent of their incomes; but in Russia, there are so few of 
them, they are but units in the millions of population. In statistics of the expen- 
diture of society on the education of youths wey, can not be taken into considera- 
tion, being quite an exception. 
The result is therefore perfectly clear. Russian society, striving toward edu- 
cation, expends five or seven times more than the State. Is such a state of things 
correct? To secure an indispensable equality between the needs of society and 
expenditure out of the State budget, the Government should, by an augmented 
outlay for education, equalize its contribution to that of the public. When the 
State shall begin to spend on education the same percentage of its budget as is 
expended by a Russian family—say, about 10 per cent, or 100,000,000 rubles 
($51,400,000)—then, of course, we shall not have a deficiency in any kind of 
schools—in national or lower, or in middle and higher schools. Of course, it is 
impossible to attain such a condition at once; butif the Government annually and 
gradually increases the budget of the ministry of education by 5,000,000 rubles 
($2,570,000), which can not be burdensome, considering the immensity of overes- 
timated appointments, then in the course of four years the budget would be 
doubled, and we would almost have double the number of school establishments, 
and the existing ones would flourish perfectly.

CONSULAR REPORTS ON EDUCATIONAL TOPICS. 1497 
AMERICAN COMPETITION IN EUROPE. 
In an extensive report on this subject, Mr. Frank H. Mason, United States 
consul-general at Frankfort, Germany, says under date of December 31, 1897: 
“The year now drawing toa close will be remembered as an epoch in the indus- 
trial and commercial relations between the leading European countries and the 
United States. The remarkable fact of 1897 has been the enforced recognition of 
the truth that in several important lines of manufacture—notably that of iron 
and steel—the scepter of economical production, combined with payment of the 
highest wages to labor, has passed from the Old World to the New. 
“For years European economists have struggled against the conclusions which 
practical men are now forced to accept. It has been argued that, through what 
they regarded a false fiscal policy, and the exaggerated wages accorded to labor, 
high cost of living, and lack of general technical education, American manufac- 
tures, in which labor formed an important percentage of cost, could never seri- 
ously compete in the world’s markets with the low wages, frugal living, and 
patient twelve-hour toil of the Old World, where, in many places, communities 
have been trained for generations in specialized forms of industry. 
“But it has been demonstrated that, under intelligent, progressive management, 
highly paid labor, especially when employed to use complicated machinery, is, 
after all, the cheapest, and that in the race for supremacy, the inert, congested 
populations of the Old World have been in many cases left behind by the people 
who, more than any other, have reduced economy of labor to an exact science. .. . 
“Tt seems impossible to repeat too often or emphasize too strongly the futility 
of trying to reach the German market with circulars and catalogues printed in 
English, with weights and values in pounds and dollars, or the importance of 
_ showing and explaining goods to the dealers and consumers in foreign lands who 
may become purchasers. Neither is it any longer sufficient for machinery and 
other merchandise to be exhibited only at London or Paris. In order to reach the 
German irade, they must be shown, and, in case of a machine, set up and put to 
work at Berlin or some other large German city. Germany has now reached a 
stature that, it is felt, entitles this country to be treated as a national entity, and 
however much public opinion here may, upon abstract principle, deprecate the 
increased importation of manufactured products, those immediately interested in 
their sale or use are gratified by every liberal, well-sustained effort to attract and 
retain their patronage. . . . 
“The contest narrows down, ultimately, to one of comparative resources, econ- 
omy in manufacture, and skillful enterprise in selling; and in all these, except the 
last, our country has assuredly nothing to fear. With the most modern and 
effective machinery, the most efficient labor, ample capital, and an unequaled fac- 
tory system the Republic, in the closing years of the century, fixes new standards 
in cheapness of production and passes definitely from the réle of customer to that 
of competitor... . 
“From all that can be foreseen, it would appear that competition in Germany 
will sharpen and become more determined as processes are improved and the 
whole economy of production brought more and more nearly upon equal terms. 
The contest will be one between natural resources, the inventive capacity to econ- 
omize labor, reduce freights, save waste of material, and, above all, the ability to 
skillfully sell surplus products in foreign markets. In all these, except the last, 
Americans are acknowledged masters. When they learn and act unitedly upon 
the knowledge that foreign trade must be found, developed, and maintained by 
the same means that have been so effectively employed at home—by the persistent 
personal efforts of competent salesmen, showing the goods in presence of the cus-
-P-A-G-E-370

tomer and offering them to him in the weights, values, and measures, and upon 
terms of sale and payment that prevail in foreign markets—there need be no fear 
of the result.” 
Unirep Srares STUDENTS IN FRENCH SCHOOLS. 
Gen. Horace Porter, United States ambassador to France, writes from Paris 
under date of January 11, 1898, in answer to an inquiry in regard to the admission 
of a student from the United States into the School of Mines. WNo foreign student, 
he says, can enter any of the schools of France—medicine, pharmacy, dentistry, 
veterinary medicine, painting, design, architecture, music, declamation, engineer- 
ing, etc.—without the formal application of the diplomatic representative of his 
country. In most cases two letters suffice, one making application, the other 
expressing thanks when the request is granted. Sometimes more correspondence 
is necessary, for the reason that those proposing to enter any of the high-grade 
schools have to produce tertain certificates of studies or diplomas, which the 
authorities accept only when they come through the embassy. These rules, says 
General Porter, apply to all foreign students. No discrimination is made against 
Americans; on the contrary, the authorities extend all possible facilities to them. 
There is a large number of American students in Paris, and, as a rule, they are 
much liked by the teachers in French institutions. 
As for the School of Mines, he continues, foreigners can be admitted there either 
as foreign pupils, in which case they have to stand an examination, or as free 
auditors, in which case there is no examination. The courses, however, are not 
all open to that class of students, and no diploma is granted them. In both cases 
they have to pay 50 francs ($9.65) for matriculation. If the school is full, as occa- 
sionally happens, the application for admission is put off until the next year. 
CoMMERCIAL HicH ScHoon at LErpzie. 
According to statement of Mr. Thomas Ewing Moore, commercial agent at 
Weimar, under date of February 22, 1898, it has been decided to open a commer- 
cial high school in connection with the university the coming Easter at Leipzig. 
The conditions governing admission have now been made public. Candidates for 
matriculation must have pursued one of the courses, or have the qualifications 
hereunder specified: 
(1) Graduates of nine-grade secondary schools (Gymnasia, Real-Gymnasia, and 
Ober Realschule). 
(2) Graduates of a commercial secondary school, the course of which conforms 
with the aforementioned institutions. 
(3) Merchants who have received the certificate of the one-year volunteer mili- 
tary service and who have successfully completed their apprenticeship. 
(4) Graduates of German teachers’ seminaries who have passed the qualifying 
examination (‘‘second state examination ”). 
(5) Foreigners who establish proof of a corresponding education and who are 
over 20 years of age. 
The two last points were not definitely decided upon at the commercial high 
school conference at Hanover. Up to the present, entrance examinations have 
not been considered. Students of the University of Leipzig, merchants, teach- 
ers, etc., may attend certain lectures. As to the admission of students of the 
commercial high school to the university lectures, definite arrangements have 
been made with the authorities. 
A seminary for training teachers for the commercial high school will be estab- 
lished to which students of the University of Leipzig, as well as other educated 
candidates for commercial high-school teacherships (including teachers and mer- 
   
-P-A-G-E-371
CONSULAR REPORTS ON EDUCATIONAL TOPICS. 1499 
chants of at least six years’ experience, who have received a seminary education 
and who have the right to one-year volunteer military service), will be admitted, 
In view of the great need of commercial teachers, this plan meets with great 
approval.! 
THE WorLp’s Larcust LIBRARIES, 
United States Consul Eugene Germain, at Zurich, Switzerland, writes under 
date of August 31, 1897: 
The largest and best collection of books in the world is to be fotind in the 
National Library of France. This collection contains 2,600,000 bound volumes 
and about 1,300,000 copies of pamphlets; in other words, it contains about double 
the books at the British Museum. 
The building, which is now known as the “‘Bibliotéque Nationale,” was at one 
time the home of Cardinal Mazarin. To Charles V belongs the honor of having 
been its founder. 
The Imperial Library of Russia, established by Peter the Great in 1714, is the 
third among the world’s great libraries. It contains about 1,200,000 volumes and 
about 26,000 manuscripts. It attained a place in the front rank of European 
libraries by the acquisition of the celebrated Zalusky collection; Count Zalusky 
had collected about 260,000 volumes and 10,000 MSS. In the suppression of the 
Jesuit order in Russia the collection of books in their possession was taken in 
charge by Prince Italinsky, and among other libraries the prince transferred the 
Zalusky collection from the Jesuit college at Warsaw to St. Petersburg. The 
most important of the manuscripts in this library is the famous ‘“‘ Codex Sinaiti- 
cus” of the Greek Bible, brought from the convent of St. Catherine on Mount 
Sinai by Professor Tischendorf in 1859, 
The fourth largest library is the Royal Library of Berlin, with 850,000 volumes. 
It was started in 1661 by the great elector, Frederick William. The Royal 
Library of Munich contains 540,000 books and 400,000 pamphlets. This library is 
especially rich in incunabula, and occupies the finest library building in Europe. 
The fifth in rank is the United States Library, with 680,000 volumes; Strass- 
burg, with 645,000, is sixth; Boston, with 597,152 volumes, is seventh. The eighth 
is the Imperial Library in Vienna, containing 570,000 volumes and about 20,000 
MSS. The Royal Library at Copenhagen is the largest Scandinavian library, 
founded in the sixteenth century, and is particularly strong in Icelandic litera- 
ture. Among its most valuable MSS. is the collection of Tycho Brahe, the 
Danish astronomer. The most valuable library in Italy is in the Vatican, but the 
largest, containing 400,000 volumes, is in Florence. 
Chief among the collections open to the public in Belgium is the Royal Library, 
containing no less than 405,000 books and 30,000 MSS. 
THE UNIVERSITY OF Bonn. 
Report of Vice and Acting Consul W. H. MAppEN, of Cologne, Germany. 
The Frederick William University, at Bonn on the Rhine, is frequented by 
about 2,000 students. If Berlin, Munich, and Leipzig, with about 9,000, 4,000, and 
3,000 students, respectively, rank as the largest among German universities, Bonn 
is entitled to the first place among the smaller ones. 
It is a healthy town of 43,000 inhabitants, much in favor as a residence by 
learned men and artists, retired merchants and manufacturers. The neighbor- 
hood of the Seven Mountains offers opportunities for delightful excursions in sum- 
mer, it being possible to reach in one afternoon the beautiful spots, Godesberg,

  1500 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Koenigswinter, and Rolandseck. Well-to-do students can even reside in Godes- 
berg or Koenigswinter. 
The expenses of living are, according to American ideas, relatively small. A 
student engages a room or rooms for the half year, paying monthly. The price 
of one room is from 15 to 25 marks ($3.57 to $5.95) a month; for two, 25 to 40 
marks ($9.52), with attendance. Breakfast, dinner, and supper come to about 75 
marks. Thus for 100 marks ($23.80) board and lodging are obtainable, good 
enough to satisfy the demands of even fastidious young men. The average 
amount for board and lodging would not exceed 75 marks. 
The expenses of the university course are likewise moderate. The matricula- 
tion fees come to 18 marks ($4.28); those for private lectures four times a week to 
about 20 marks ($4.75). The fees for medical lectures are usually higher. Besides, 
each student pays 8 marks (¢1.90), Auditorengeld, and contributes 2 marks to an 
academical sick fund—an admirable institution, providing in case of illness, 
admission into a hospital, medical attendance and medicine gratis. 
German students are only allowed to matriculate on producing a certificate 
proving that they have passed the final examination of a public classical school 
(gymnasium) or a modern high school (realschule). This examination is for 
youths from 18 to 20 who have attended a high school for nine years. Young 
men, likewise, who possess only the certificate entitling them to one year’s military 
service, are admitted for four terms of six months each. They are from 15 to 17 
years of age, having attended a high school for six years and learned either French 
and English or Latin and Greek. As regards foreigners, the rule is that they can 
matriculate and be entered in any faculty, provided they prove that they possess 
an education equivalent to the above. Thus their admission is made easy anda 
cordial welcome extended to them. Should a young man desire, however, to go 
up for an examination he will do well to furnish himself with a certificate that he 
has attended a university in his own country. 
It is well known that to German students almost entire freedom is accorded 
both in their private life and in their studies, the university exercising only the 
mildest supervision over the latter. They do not, however, often abuse their lib- 
erty, having been trained for nine years to hard work both at home and at school. 
Nevertheless, during the first or even the second half year there is not generally 
much work done, a sort of tacit right to a year of freedom being conceded to 
them, and when grown accustomed to their independence they renew their former 
habits of diligence. 
The Bonn University consists of five faculties: Divinity, Protestant and Cath- 
olic; law, medicine, and philosophy. A Catholic theological faculty is found else- 
where only in Breslau and Tiibingen. The Episcopal authorities are permitted to 
exercise a certain influence in this faculty. 
The philosophical faculty embraces all subjects not comprehended in the first 
four faculties— history, philosophy, philology, classical romance and German, 
mathematics, chemistry, science, zoology, all being comprised. The increasing 
importance of the mathematical and natural science departments has led in other 
universities to a division into two sections—history and philology in the one, 
mathematics and natural science in the other. In two universities a complete 
separation has already taken place, there being a natural science faculty as well 
as a philological faculty. Bonn, however, still, outwardly, retains the old union. 
In the winter 1896-97 the number of students in the different faculties was as 
follows— 
Protestant theology - 
Catholic theology - - 
Law .. - 
Medicine - 
Philosophy -

and at the Agricultural College at Poppelsdorf, in connection with the university, 
there were 40 students. The teaching staff consisted at that time of 71 ordinary 
professors, 29 extraordinary, 43 private lecturers (privat-docenten), 4 tutors 
(lectoren), and at the Agricultural College above mentioned 11 ordinary and 13 
extraordinary professors. In order to comprehend the position of the different 
university teachers it is necessary to take a glance at the general constitutions of 
German universities. 
The University of Bonn, although only founded in 1818, has in the main the 
same constitution as all the other German universities, which in many points 
retain the medieval system. They were originally self-governing corporations 
possessed of considerable privileges. The teaching staff was recruited from the 
students, the ablest of the latter starting lectures on their own account and gath- 
ering audiences. The corporation granted the right to do this by bestowing 
academical degrees. The title of licentiate has survived only in the theological 
faculty, but that of doctor in all the faculties, it representing the sole direct 
advantage which the university has full power to confer. 
The value of the doctor's degree varies in the different universities and in the 
several faculties in proportion to the difficulty in obtaining it. The faculties in 
Bonn all require of the candidates a written dissertation involving scientific 
research, as well as a viva voce examination. 
In jurisprudence the highest proficiency is exacted and a degree only rarely con- 
ferred, while that in philosophy is but a little less difficult of attainment. The 
act of receiving the degree itself has become a mere ceremony, in which various 
ancient usages are retained. Even the final disputation, in which the candidate 
defends his theses, is devoid of any significance. The granting of a degree, which, 
by the way, is attended with considerable expense to the graduate, is a private 
affair of the university. The State respects the title and protects it from misuse, 
put recognizes no rights or claims upon itself on the part of its possessor. The 
sole privilege that it confers is the right of giving lectures in a university, never- 
theless it is indispensable to a learned career. 
The graduate commences his university career as private lecturer (privat-docent) , 
but receives no salary. He announces his lectures. As, however, attendance at 
any particular lecture is not compulsory, his success depends entirely upon his 
power of attracting students. Should he be successful, he is appointed extraor- 
dinary professor by the faculty or called in that capacity to ancther university, 
the minister of instruction and of ecclesiastical and medical affairs confirming the 
election. The salary of extraordinary professors is small and the position not one 
of much importance, the power and influence of the university being chiefly cen- 
tered in the ordinary professors. 
The “‘lectoren” are teachers of modern languages, and mostly foreigners, and can 
become professors should they devote themselves to philosophy and literature. 
The assistants, young men who haye taken their doctor’s degree and are mostly 
preparing for a university career, give their services to the medical staff in the 
clinical hospitals and to the directors of the various laboratories, 
There exists a good deal of rivalry between the different universities in their 
efforts to attract specially capable men by urging the ministers to offer higher 
salaries, and thus induce them to exchange one sphere of work for another. This 
rivalry is not confined to Prussian universities, all the German, also Austrian, 
Swiss, and even Russian universities taking part in it, the result of which is much 
going to and fro in the learned world, for it may happen that a professor is to be 
found at one time in Dorpat, shortly afterwards in Strassburg, and finally in 
Berlin. 
The ordinary professors of each faculty elect annually one of their number to 
be dean, and the whole body of these professors elect the rector, who likewise fills 
 
-P-A-G-E-374
       1502 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
his office for a year. The deans form the chief medium of communication between 
the undergraduates and the university. the rector representing the university. A 
committee of professors, the senate, assist him in council. It is evident that the 
Prussian universities possess a large measure of independence in internal affairs— 
freedom in teaching is jealously guarded. On tke other hand, the State has its 
own rights, viz, the whole administration of the finances, and by merely granting 
or refusing funds exerts great influence. Each university has a curator, who is 
the representative of the minister, and exercises the governmental control. The 
post is a difficult one, calling for much tact, and is filled by an ex-minister or an 
official of that department. The present curator in Bonn, von Rothenburg, was 
formerly under secretary. Efforts have been made to extend the influence of the 
State, but hitherto without much success. The professors can neither be removed 
nor made to retire except of their own free will. On the other hand, the State 
has in the course of time obtained entire control of the examinations, State exam- 
inations are held in each faculty, and it is these which open the door to an official 
career and to medical and legal practice. The State appoints in each province an 
examining body, which is annually renewed, consisting, indeed, as a rule, of the 
ordinary professors of the respective universities. But the whole institution is 
formally dissociated from the university, and.the goal of their studies is for the 
many the State examination, for the few the degree of doctor. In this way also 
the State wields a far greater influence upon university life than would appear on 
a superficial view, for a man naturally selecis the lectures of his future examiner. 
As regards the professors of to-day, the writer is unfortunately not in a position 
to give his individual opinion, except upon those of the philosophical faculty, and, 
as is well known, it is difficult to judge from the experience of others. But in 
general it may be said that, as a rule, only men of exceptional ability are called 
to Bonn, which is a rich place, and having great attractions is selected by many 
in preference to a larger university. Many eminent names figure in its history. 
We may mention that in Protestant theology the liberal as well as the orthodox 
school is represented, But when recently complaints were made by the orthodox 
the Government took measures to strengthen the positive element in the faculty. 
In physiology Pflueger ranks as one of the first authorities. Professor Schede, 
who succeeded Trendelnburg, the surgeon, now at Leipzig, is thought well of. 
Fritsch, the gynecologist, and Koester, the pathologist, were mentioned as distin- 
guished scientists. In the philosophical faculty the classics are brilliantly repre- 
sented. The names Boecheler, Usener, and Svescheke, the archeologist, are 
renowned far beyond Germany. The chief representative of the German lan- 
guage is Willmann, who, at the instance of the minister, Puttkammer, has intro- 
duced a reformed German orthography, which, however, does not yet find gen- 
eral acceptance. In other branches also the philosophical faculty is rich in learned 
men. Foerster, an authority in the philology of the romance languages, worthily 
fills the chair of Frederick Diez, the founder of that science. 
In the department of natural science we have to mourn the loss of Clausius, 
the first to propound the mechanical theory of heat; of Hertz, to whom we owe 
the theory of the undulating motion of electricity, and of whose famous experi- 
ments the whole world is still talking, and of Kekulé, the great chemist—all dead 
within a short time of each other. Whether their successors will be reckoned 
among the illustrious remains to be seen. In any case it is evident that in the 
choice of its professors Bonn upholds the best traditions. 
The academical year is divided into two terms, the summer term lasting nomi- 
nally from April 15 to August 15, and the winter term from October 15 to March 
15. In reality, owing to alate commencement and early close one must deduct 
at least one month, the academical year being thus reduced te eight months. 
The lectures are private and public. The private ones, for which fees are 
 
-P-A-G-E-375
O_O 
CONSULAR REPORTS ON EDUCATIONAL TOPICS. 1503 
charged, are mostly of a severely scientific character; the public ones are free and 
of a more popular character, thus attracting students from other faculties. The 
private lectures—collegium is the students’ expression—take up more time and 
are termed ‘‘lectures of four hours,” when given four times a week for one hour. 
The honorarium is fixed and received by the respective privat docent or private 
lecturer. A movement is now on foot, however, to abolish the fees, and the Goy- 
ernment is treating with the university respecting another method of regulating 
the emoluments of the professors. American onlookers should, above all, bear in 
mind that the official salaries are often small according to our ideas, but that 
this is partly compensated by pensions and provisions for widows and orphans. 
Besides the lectures in which only the professor speaks, there are in all depart- 
ments opportunities for practical training. In law, theology, and philosophy 
there are so-called seminaries where intercourse is freer between professor and 
student. They read together, and give and receive a stimulus to individual 
research. Nevertheless the seminaries are kept somewhat apart from the general 
life of the university, the number of members being limited, and it being consid- 
ered an advantage to be admitted. They are, in fact, institutions with special 
financial administration, special buildings, and usually possessing a valuable _ 
library. Of these seminaries there are in Bonn not fewer than ten. Correspond- 
ing to them in the natural science department there are institutes in the medical 
clinical hospitals. Of the former there are eleven, of the latter eight, mostof them 
located in fine new buildings and supplied with excellent museums. There are 
institutes for anatomy, physiology, hygiene, chemistry; clinical hospitals for dis- 
eases of the skin, the eye, the ear, the internal organs, for women, .and for mental 
cases. Of course, these are not all in one building, but are dispersed over the 
town, some being as far away as Poppelsdorf. 
We must not omit to mention the university library, one of the most important 
in the country; the botanical gardens, the observatory, and various museums, 
We thus see here in a small space, developed in the course of a century, an insti- 
tution which, were it to be suddenly called into existence, would require an 
outlay of millions, but whose organization can only be understood as an historical 
growth. 
Report ON PuBLic INSTRUCTION IN THE REPUBLIC OF URUGUAY. 
Report of Consul ALBERT W. Swaum, of Montevideo, Uruguay. 
The aunual report of public instruction for the Republic of Uruguay has been 
issued, and the figures presented by Don Urbano Chucarro show a very commend- 
able degree of progress and development. From the voluminous report I trans- 
late the material facts for the benefit of the American educational world. It 
should be borne in mind that Uruguay is one of the most progressive of South 
American States in educational matters, and from 1876, when education was first 
made a governmental matter in the way of support and official care, up to the 
present time there has been but one year in which there was no increase in public 
schools. (In a parenthetical way, it may be here stated that during the said 
period the country had to overcome the effects of three revolutions.) The total 
number of schools in the several departments, or counties, as they may be called, 
is 533, and they have an average term time of nine months. The cities and towns 
have 181 schools, the rural sections reporting 352, and the increase in recent years 
has been more largely in the latter class. The change is shown thus: In 1876, 68 
per cent were city schools and 32 per cent country schools. In 1896 the country 
schools had 67 per cent and the city list stood at 83 per cent. 
In grades they stands.as follows: First grade, 53; second grade, 124; third grade, 
4, and ungraded, 352. Classified by sex, there are 69 for boys (varones) exclu-  
-P-A-G-E-376

| sively, 47 for girls (nifias), and 417 mixed. These latter have proven very success- 
ful, notwithstanding that the idea clashed somewhat harshly with the old rule of 
absolute separation of the sexes in schools. 
The attendance at the schools averages nearly 9 per cent of the population, and 
while that figure may appear low, it is very considerably the highest reported in 
South American States. It is also a matter of gratification that the educationa] 
men of Uruguay are very earnest and very sincere in their efforts to bring about 
a greater attendance, in which the interest of parents gives most helpful aid. 
The number of teachers employed in 1896 was 1,990; of these, 1,041 were in the 
public schools and 949 in private schools, the teachers being all natives but 606. 
The male teachers numbered 601; the female 1,389. The number of children 
enrolled in the public schools was 51,312, and in the private schools 22,689. 
These public schools, church and secular, are largely located in the cities, there 
being 289 in town to 90 in the country, a total of 379 for the whole State. This 
gives a total of 912 schools, public and private. 
The total cost of the public schools per scholar was, for each scholar enrolled, 
$12.38; for each attendant the cost was $18.83, Uruguay money, the Uruguayan 
dollar being $1.0353, of the money of the United States. The department has 
paid out $727,827.82 for the period reported, but the sum will be exceeded by the 
year 1897. Of the school buildings, 156 are owned by the department and 533 are 
rented, and the rent account foots up to $130,256.56, and the superintendent very 
wisely regrets that the rent takes out so much good money from the fund, when 
there is such great need for all and much more in more direct educational work. 
The average pay for the teachers is, for males, $36.65; females, $33.25, or a mean 
average of $35.50. 
Among the improvements in the system may be named a normal school for 
teachers, for males only, there being in successful operation one for females 
already. In these schools the modern methods of fitting men and women for 
their work are used, so far as may be possible under the changed conditions, as 
understood in comparison between this country and the United States. ‘There is 
not such a thing asa high-school system as known in the United States, but there 
isa university, with public support and under governmental control. Dr, Alfredo 
Vazquez Acevedo is the rector or president of the board. The university has law, 
medical, engineering, and collegiate departments, and also a preparatory depart- 
ment in connection with the collegiate department. The attendance is very flat- 
tering, and the work done commends itself to the student of any nation for its 
thoroughness. 
The grading of the public schools is apparently on about the same level as the 
American grade for the first grade, but the second and third grades are more com- 
prehensive than the American grade of same number, and these should properly 
be classed as second to fifth, and fifth to eighth grades, American classification. 
The attendance in the public and private schools is reported as follows:

  In the city private schools there are 6,898 ungraded, 3,734 on collegiate studies, 
and 8,994 in church schools—or for these a total of 19,126 scholars. In the coun- 
try private schools, there are 2,459. ungraded, 405 on collegiate lines, and 699 in 
church care. The average general attendance was 74 per cent of the enrollment. 
This report and personal observation proves that the administrative powers of 
Uruguay are deeply interested in public and general education for the masses, and 
that, so far as their finances will permit, all possible aid will be given to the 
upbuilding of a system that shall be a model one in every respect. 
There has been gathered here, in connection with the National Museum, a very 
complete collection of pedagogical equipment, in which many appliances are seen 
and many have been adopted and are in daily use in the schools. But things dis- 
tinctively local merit the highest praise and show best of skill in manufacture 
and wisdom in application.

I._SEVERAL PROBLEMS IN GRADED-SCHOOL MANAGEMENT.' 
There is a growing conviction among the more intelligent observers of our 
graded system of schools, that there are serious defects either in the system itself 
or in its administration. This conviction is the strongest where the schools have 
reached the highest degree of system and uniformity—where, in other words, the 
system, as asystem, has attained the highest perfection. 
That we may better consider these defects, let us glance at the mechanical fea- 
tures of a system of graded schools—not a real system as actually administered 
anywhere, but a system ideally perfect as a mechanism. 
In the first place, it maps out and prescribes a definite and detailed course of 
study and instruction, the best that is practicable if not the best theoretically pos- 
sible. This course is subdivided, and the time for the mastery of each part, as 
well as the whole, is definitely fixed. The pupils are next divided into grades or 
classes, corresponding to the subdivisions of the course, and all the pupils of each 
grade or class are required to pursue the same studies, to the same extent, in the 
same order, and with the same rate of progress. In other words, the mechanism 
of the graded system demands absolute uniformity in each grade, and the more 
nearly this essential condition is realized the more nearly perfect is its mechanical 
operation. 
This view discloses the difficulties which attend the administration of the sys- 
tem. As a mechanism, it demands that pupils of the same grade attend school 
with regularity, and that they possess equal attainments, equal mental capacity, 
equal physical vigor, equal home assistance and opportunity, and that they be 
instructed by teachers possessing equal ability and skill. But this uniformity 
does not exist. Teachers possess unequal skill and power. Pupils do not enter 
school at the same age; some attend only a portion of each year; others attend 
irregularly, and the members of the same class possess unequal ability and have 
unequal assistance and opportunity. This want of uniformity in conditions 
makes the mechanical operation of the system imperfect, and hence its tendency 
is to force uniformity, thus sacrificing its true function as a means of education 
to its perfect action asa mechanism. Thisis the inherent tendency of the system 
when operated as a machine, and hence the great difficulty in administering it is 
to control this procrustean tendency and secure a necessary degree of uniformity 
without ignoring or forcibly reducing differences in pupils and teachers. 
The foregoing remarks prepare the way for an intelligent consideration of sev- 
eral problems in the management of graded schools.

I, How can pupils be taught in classes in a graded system without sacrificing 
their individual powers and wants? 
The pupils in graded schools, as we have seen, are divided into classes, and to 
secure necessary economy these classes are made as large as practicable. The 
fewer the number of pupils embraced in the system, the fewer must be the num- 
ber of classes, and as a consequence the greater must be the inequality in the 
attainments and capacity of the members of each class, and hence the greater the 
difficulty of the problem now under consideraticn. If the teacher of a class adapt 
his instruction and requirements to the maximum capacity of his pupils, the great 
majority are hurried over their studies and receive a superficial and imperfect 
training. If he adapt his class work to the minimum capacity of the class, the 
great majority are held back, and as a consequence not only sacrifice time and 
opportunity, but fall into careless and indolent habits of study. The remaining 
course is for the teacher to adapt his class work to the medium or average capac- 
ity of his pupils, with such special attention to the more and the less advanced 
pupils as may meet to some extent their wants. But here comes in the “per cent 
system,” with its demands. That the class, as a whole, may attain a high average 
per cent, it is necessary that the lowest members of it reach a good standard, and 
this results in the holding back of the bright and industrious pupils until by 
iteration and reiteration the dull and indolent may be brought to the required 
standard. The amount of time and talent thus wasted in some graded schools, is 
very great. This is not always evident to the teacher, since the brightest pupils, 
being chained to the dullest, soon learn to keep step, scarcely showing their abil- 
ity to advance more rapidly. This difficulty is greatly aggravated when classes 
are promoted en masse from grade to grade, the pupils being thus chained to each 
other year after year or throughout the course—an efficient process for reducing 
pupils to the level of mediocrity, 
The statement of these difficulties suggests their partial remedy. The brighter 
and more capable pupils in each class must have the opportunity to work away 
from the less capable and to step forward into a higher class when the difference 
between them and their lower classmates becomes too great for a profitable union 
in the same class. To this end there must be a proper interval between the suc- 
cessive classes, and the reclassification of pupils must be made with corresponding 
frequency. 
Experience alone can determine what this interval should be and the frequency 
with which pupils should be promoted. It is possible that both of these facts may 
depend somewhat upon the number of pupils included in a graded system, a much 
more complete classification being possible in large cities than in small towns. 
While this may be true, it is believed by many experienced superintendents and 
other intelligent observers that the universal experience of graded schools con- 
demns the prevalent practice of promoting pupils but once a year, with a year’s 
interval between the classes. This wide interval is a serious obstacle in the way 
of a needed reclassification of pupils. The more capable pupils can not be trans- 
ferred to a higher class, since this obliges them to go over the ground of two years 
in one—a task successfully performed by very few pupils—and the less advanced 
pupils can not be put back into a lower class without serious loss in time and 
ambition, if they are not withdrawn from school. It may be well for a few pupils 
inany system of graded schools to spend an entire year in reviewing the previous 
year’s work, but these exceptional cases are usually the result of an unwise 
attempt to hold pupils too long together. Large classes of young pupils can not 
be kept together even for one year without serious loss both to those who are held 
back and to those who are unduly hurried. What is needed is a system of classi- 
fication and promotion that shall provide for the breaking of classes at least twice 
a year, with a transfer of the more advanced pupils and their union with the less
-P-A-G-E-381
PROBLEMS IN GRADED SCHOOL MANAGEMENT. 1509 
advanced pupils of the next higher class, and also with special transfers of bright 
pupils from class to class as often as may be necessary, and special provision for 
pupils deficient in some branch of study. 
We are aware that the system of annual promotions has special advantages, It 
reduces the number of classes in the smaller cities and towns, and it saves labor 
and trouble, especially when classes are promoted in a body on a minimum stand- 
ard. It is undoubtedly true that a procrustean system which puts pupils in 
classes, reduces them to the same capacity, and moves them regularly and evenly 
forward requires little skill or trouble to run it, but this can not compensate for 
the serious losses involved. The highest good of pupils ought never to be sacri- 
ficed to secure a self-adjusting mechanism and uniformity of results. 
If, Another problem in the management of graded schools, to which attention 
is called, may be thus stated: How to subject the results of school instruction to 
examination tests and not narrow and groove such instruction. 
In a graded system of schools there must necessarily be some uniform basis of 
classification and promotion, since the object of classifying pupils is to bring those 
of like attainments into the same classes that they may advance together, and 
at the same time receive the greatest possible benefit from the instruction 
imparted. The promotion of pupils on the recommendation of teachers, or by 
classes without reference to relative attainments, is, as all experience shows, sub- 
versive of classification and thoroughness of instruction; and especially is this 
true in a system of schools comprising several departments or classes of the same 
grade. Teachers differ widely in skill and efficiency, and, as a general rule, the 
more superficial the teacher the higher his estimate of the attainments of his 
pupils. Hence the relative acquirements and standing of pupils must be deter- 
iiined by the application of some uniform test; and the more thorough and com- 
prehensive this test the more complete, other things being equal, will be the 
resulting classification. Moreover, teachers as a class need the check of test 
examinations to prevent a too rapid advancement of their pupils. I have seen 
graded schools in which all proper classification was destroyed by the strife 
between teachers to advance their pupils into higher books and studies. 
But whatever may be true of the necessity or value of test examinations, they 
are very generally employed in graded schools, and their character largely deter- 
mines the character of school instruction. If the examination tests are narrow 
and technical, the instruction will be narrow and technical; if the tests run to 
figures, the instruction will run to figures; if the tests demand details, they will 
“‘emphasize and make imperative all the lumber of the text-books;” if they cover 
only a part of the studies, the non-test studies will receive little attention. Indeed, 
it may be stated as a general fact that school instruction ’s never much wider or 
better than the tests by which it is measured. 
This narrowing and grooving tendency of test examinations is greatly increased 
when the results are used as a means of comparing the standing of schools and 
the success of teachers. The principal of the first grammar school in one of the 
largest cities in the East once said to the writer: ‘‘My success as a teacher is 
measured by the per cent of correct answers my pupils give to the series of ques- 
tions submitted in the examinations for promotion to the high school. Whatever 
qualifications these tests call for I must produce or fail. I can not stop to inquire 
whether my instruction is right or wrong. I must prepare my wares for the 
market.” Few teachers can resist the grooving influence of such a system, and, 
in spite of it, teach according to their better knowledge and judgment. I have 
seen blackboards covered with “‘ probable” questions, and classes, meeting before 
and after school to be crammed with set answers to them, as a preparation for a 
test examination. I have known classes to memorize the names of all the bones 
in the human body, hundreds of dates in American history, and scores of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-382
Oooo 
1510 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
mechanical processes of mensuration, because these things were known hobbies 
of the question maker. I have known the instruction of an entire corps of inter- 
mediate or grammar-school teachers to be largely concentrated on three or four 
test studies, to the great neglect of other branches of equal, if not greater, impor- 
tance. Principals have neglected the lower Classes in their schools and given their 
time and energies for weeks to the special drilling of their first class—the one to 
be subjected to the comparative test—and pupils have thus been fearfully over- 
tasked. 
The difficulties and errors thus pointed out suggest their remedies. We have 
only time for three or four specifications. The examination tests should be as 
wide as the approved course of instruction, covering every study and every impor- 
tant exercise. Since this can not be done when the examinations are conducted 
exclusively in writing, the written tests should be supplemented by oral ones, 
relating not only to the branches of study, but also to the discipline of the schools, 
their moral influence and life, the manners inculcated, and the general culture 
imparted. It is true that this will require time, but are not these things as 
important as the narrow and technical knowledge usually covered by the written 
tests? 
Again, the questions should be so framed as to test the pupil’s knowledge of the 
subjects taught—his comprehension of the leading facts and principles, rather 
than his familiarity with the details and verbiage of the text-book. They should 
place training before cramming and culture before technics. It is true that 
classes thus examined will not reach as high a per cent as they would were the 
tests confined strictly to the text-books—were every question to fall within the 
prescribed course of instruction. But the object of a test examination is not to 
assist pupils in reaching a high per cent, but to determine what they actually 
know and to indicate what they ought to know. When classes reach an average 
of £0 to 100 per cent in a test examination, the fact is of itself evidence that the 
tests were either grooved to a narrow course of instruction, or that the special 
drilling of the more backward pupils was attended with a great sacrifice of time 
and opportunity on the part of the other pupils. 
~Another remedy suggested is that the results of test examinations should not be 
used to compare schools and teachers. A careful observation of this practice for 
years has convinced me that such comparisons are generally unjust and mischie- 
yous. There is often a marked difference in the intelligence of the different dis- 
tricts in a city, in the number of pupils under instruction, andin other conditions 
for which the board of education and the public make no allowance. Moreover, 
these published tables of examination per cents often put a premium on special 
cramming and false teaching, and sometimes on downright dishonesty. The 
teacher who ignores higher motives and bends all his energies to secure a high 
per cent is rewarded, while the teacher who scorns to degrade his high calling to 
the preparation of ‘“‘wares for the market” is condemned. When the schools 
brought into comparison with each other are in the same building and under the 
same principal, these evils are more readily avoided. 
A final suggestion is that the pupil’s standing should be the result not of one 
but of several examinations. The holding of monthly examinations, a practice 
now quite common in Ohio and the West generally, I believe, is much better than 
the former practices of annual and term examinations. The reasons are too 
obvious to require their statement. I will only add that these monthly examina- 
tions are often a severe tax on both teachers and pupils. It is simply an outrage 
to require children to write from four to six hours a day under the severe strain 
of a test examination. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals 
should so extend the sphere of its humane efforts as to include some of our public 
schools on examination days.

  PROBLEMS IN GRADED SCHOOL MANAGEMENT. 1511 
HI, Another problem in graded school management touches the freedom of the 
teacher, and may thus be stated: How to subject a corps of teachers to efficient 
supervision and not reduce them to operatives. 
The adoption of a definite course of study with subdivisions corresponding to 
the number of classes, a'l following each other in natural order, necessitates the 
mastery of each of the successive portions as a preparation for the next higher. 
When the pupils in the lower grades or classes are sufficiently numerous to occupy 
several schoolrooms under different teachers, the progress and attainments of the 
several sections of each grade or class must be sufficiently uniform to enable them 
to come together in the upper grades or classes. This necessitates a degree of 
uniformity of instruction, and itis just here that the mechanism of the graded 
system touches its very life, as the experience of too many of the larger cities 
plainly shows. Tosecure this uniformity of instruction the course is mapped out 
in minute details, and the time to be devoted to each part, the order in which the 
steps are to be taken, and even the methods of teaching, are definitely and authori- 
tatively prescribed. a result the teacher is not free to teach according to his 
“conscience and power,” but his high office is degraded to the grinding of pre- 
scribed grists,in prescribed quantities, and with prescribed fineness—tothe turning 
of the crank of a revolving mechanism. 
The supervising principal of a public school in a large city once said to the 
speaker: “It is idle to ask my teachers to read professional works. They follow 
the prescribed course of study and look to me for their methods. Their ambition 
is to do their work precisely as I direct, and they dothis without inquiring whether 
my methods are correct or incorrect. It is enough that I prescribe them.” It is 
possible that this may be an extreme case, but it illustrates the tendency of the 
system when administered asa mechanism. It seems unnecessary to say that this 
prescribed uniformity in both the matter and method of instruction is subversive 
of all true teaching. Carpets may be woven, garments made, and stone carved 
by pattern, but the unfolding and informing of a human soul is not the work of 
operatives, following appointed forms and methods. The human soul is not 
touched by the revolving cogs of mechanical methods. True teaching requires 
the artist’s hand and the artist’s spirit. Fruitful methods may be evoked; they 
can never be imposed. They must bear the impress of the teacher's image, and 
pulsate with the life which he breathes into them. The vital element in every 
method of instruction is what the teacher puts into it, and hence the prime fact 
in every school is the teacher. It is not enough that graded schools go through’ 
with the forms of a philosophic course of instruction. The knowledge to be taught 
may be wisely selected and arranged, the successive steps may follow each other 
in natural order, and the entire mechanism may be so perfect that the revolving 
cogs touch each other with beautiful precision; and yet, if the whole be not vital- 
ized by true teaching, the system is a failure as a means of education. The one 
essential condition of success is the informing, vitalizing spirit of free, earnest 
teachers; and the more philosophical the system of instruction attempted, the 
more essential is this condition. A routine of mere book lessons may be con- 
ducted by a blind plodder who can turn the crank and tighten the screws, buta 
system of instruction, having for its grand end the right unfolding and training 
of the mind and heart, requires the insight, the invention, the skill, the inspira- 
tion of the true teacher. We are slow in learning that philosophic methods of 
teaching are practicable only to those who have some insight into their principles, 
The oral teaching in our schools is often as deadening as the old text-book drills. 
Some of the object-lesson teachers out-Herod Herod in mechanical teaching, and 
if I were obliged to choose between the text-book grinder and the crank turner of 
prescribed object lessons, I should unhesitatingly take the former, with the 
assurance that he would have something to grind.

1512 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
But how can this difficulty be avoided in a graded system of instruction? How 
can requisite uniformity be secured and, at the same time, the teacher have nec- 
essary professional freedom? I do not assume to be able fully to answer these 
questions. 
My first suggestion is that asharp discrimination must be made between results 
and methods. The essential thing in a graded system is that there be necessary 
uniformity in results at stated periods, and this can be attained without denying 
the teacher freedom in hismethods. This teacher will succeed best by one method 
and that teacher by another, and each should be left free to use his best power. 
Another suggestion may be important. A course of study may prescribe a 
minimum amount of work for each school term or year, or as a condition of pro- 
motion, but the stated order and time of the subdivisions should be merely sug- 
gestive. Uniformity should be required only so far as it may be important or 
necessary. The essential result in a graded system is that the several classes of 
the same grade come to the examination for promotion with like attainments. It 
is not important that the several teachers accomplish the same result day by day 
or week by week. Nothing is more ridiculous than the attempt to parcel out 
primary instruction and tie it up in daily or weekly prescriptions, like a doctor’s 
doses. This week the class is to take certain facts in geography; to count by twos 
to fifty (to sixty would be a fearful sin!); to draw the vertical lines of a cube; to 
learn to respect the aged, etc. - This also suggests the folly of restricting teachers 
to the work laid down in the course. One teacher can accomplish more than 
another in the same time, and, if forbidden to widen his instruction, to turn into 
new fields, the surplus time will be wasted in useless repetition. A scheme of 
study can only prescribe the minimum, the essential course. Parallel with this 
and diverging from it are lines of important knowledge, which the teachers should 
be free to explore. Moreover, it is in these very diversions from the beaten path 
that the most valuable instruction is often imparted. The teacher carries into 
them an unusual zeal and interest, and his pupils are thus quickened with a new 
inspiration. It is taken for granted in this suggestion that the schools are sup- 
plied with well qualified teachers, and this presupposes that they have received 
necessary professional preparation. We are beginning to recognize the fact that 
the essential condition of the highest success of American schools is the thorough 
normal training of our teachers. 
But the great remedy for the particular evil under consideration is intelligent, 
fiexible supervision. Supervision is of doubtful worth when it exhausts itself on 
the mere mechanism of a school system. It must, of course, secure uniformity 
and system, but these may be attained without grooving the teachers’ instruction 
or sacrificing their professional freedom and progress. An experienced superin- 
tendent once remarked that his chief business was to keep his teachers out of the 
ruts. To this end the superintendent must be qualified to instruct, inspire, and 
lead teachers in the work of professional improvement, and his supervision must 
be flexible enough to allow free investigation and experiment. It is true that a 
corps of teachers, imbued with such an earnest spirit of inquiry and progress, will 
run in noone’s groove, but what is thus lost in uniformity will be more than made 
up in vital teaching. 
IV. A fourth problem in graded-school management is the proper adaptation 
of the system to the needs of those pupils who can give only a part of their time 
to school duties. ‘‘The schools,” says a leading paper, ‘‘ allow no divided allegi- 
ance, If the boy goes to school, he must go steadily, and give it the heart of the 
working day. No provision is made for children who must devote a part of each 
day to labor.’ Hence young children are taken out of school to assist in household 
duties, to sell papers or do errands, or to render other assistance, really demand- 
ing but a portion of their time. Many pupils are withdrawn from school at a
-P-A-G-E-385

very early age to learn trades, They are too young to work more than the half of 
each day, and would make even more rapid progress in manual labor if they could 
spend the other half in school. But the doors of the public schools are closed 
against them. They must choose between the shop and the school, and the neces- 
sity of earning a living as early as possible scarcely permits, in many instances, a 
choice. 
The failure of the public schools to accommodate this class of pupils, the very 
class which, above all others, needs their advantages, has been too generally 
accepted as unavoidable. Whenever the necessities of the family have demanded 
any portion of the regular school hours, children have quietly dropped out of 
their classes and the schools have gone on apparently unconscious of their absence. 
But the proposition to enact laws compelling parents to send their children to 
school has raised the inquiry whether the schools are not responsible for some of 
the absenteeism to be thus corrected. Itis urged that the first step is to adapt 
the schools to the necessities of all classes. 
As a means to this end it has been suggested that the public schools should be 
organized on what is known as the half-time system—a system tried with 
encouraging results in Europe and also in the primary schools of several cities in 
this country. It is urged that the uniting of labor and schooling is the true idea, 
that children who devote their whole time for eight to ten years to schooling are 
not then likely to enter on manual labor with much enjoyment, and, besides, that 
labor and schooling, when united, assist each other. The half-time pupils prove, 
as a rule, as apt scholars as their full-time classmates, and, at the same time, more 
skilled workers than their unschooled workfellows. 
These considerations have certainly great weight, but I am not convinced that 
the adoption of the half-time system in the upper grades of our schools is neces- 
sary tosecure the desired end. A great many of the pupils in city schools would 
not engage in manual labor the half of each day were the half-time system 
adopted. If in school only half of the day, they would spend the other half in 
idleness or on the streets, and some in worse places. When no home study is 
required, the present system allows some six hours a day and every Saturday for 
labor and recreation. This is found to be time enough for many childrer to doall 
the work that is provided for them. It is possible that it would be better if all 
our youth had regular work the half of each day, but the public schools can not 
change the usages of society in this respect. They must conform to what is, rather 
than to what should be. 
It has also been suggested that half-time schools might be organized for work- 
ing children, and that the present system be continued for others. This involves 
not only a classification but a separation of children on the basis of manual labor, 
and we have already quite enough of this class principle in the organization of 
our schools. It is believed that the difficulty under consideration can be success- 
fully met without organizing separate schools for working children. 
What is needed is to make the course of study and requirements of our schools 
flexible enough to accommodate this class of pupils. Instead of half-time schools, 
I would suggest a half-time course of study in all grades above the primary. It 
is not necessary to require all the pupils in our public schools to take the same 
number of studies and advance with even step through the course. This pro- 
crustean device must be given up, if the public school system is to do its full 
legitimate work as an agency for the education of the whole people. Instead of 
excluding pupils who can not meet all the conditions of a complete and thorough 
course of elementary education, it must provide for such pupils the best education 
possible under the circumstances. This may involve some less in uniformity and 
system, but there will be a gain in usefulness—a result more important than 
mechanical perfection in classification.

  1514 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
The four great problems which we have thus imperfectly considered, are pre- 
eminently graded-school problems, having their origin, so to speak, in the element 
of gradation. Other educational problems, as the teacher problem, the study 
problem, the sex problem, etc., relate alike to both graded and ungraded schools. 
It is hoped that I am not understood to condemn the graded system, for the 
very aim of this paper is to assist in making the system more efficient and useful. 
It is also hoped that I am not understood to intimate that the defects pointed out 
exist in equal degree in all graded schools. I bear cheerful testimony to the fact 
that the gravity of these problems is appreciated by scores of superintendents in 
my acquaintance, and encouraging progress has been made in their practical 
solution. 
It may aiso be remarked, in conclusion, that I have aimed more to state guiding 
principles than to solve these problems in detail. The one principle I desire 
specially to impress is, that the solution of each of these four problems is found 
in the proper subordination of the demands of the graded system as a mechanism 
to its great purpose as an agency for the education of the people—for furnishing 
every child with the best possible education it is capable of receiving in the actual 
circumstances which surround it; in the proper subordination of uniformity and 
system, which are but means to the sublime end of unfolding, enriching, and 
beautifying the human soul—of touching human life in ail conditions with ele- 
vating and beneficent power. 
II.—-EDUCATION IN HAWAII FOR 1896. 
By Gen. JoHN EATON. 
The Hawaiian reports of education are biennial. A census is taken once in six 
years. These two reports coming the same year (1896) may well be considered 
together. They present an exceedingly interesting story of the education of the 
several races represented in these islands. Of the Archipelago known as the Sand- 
wich Islands, or Hawaii, only eight, Ha-wai-i, Mau-i, O-a-hu, Kau-ai, Mo-lo-kai. 
La-nai, Ka-hoo-la-we, and Nii-hau, of the principal islands extending over 300 miles 
at the eastern end of the group are inhabited. These have a total approximate 
area of 7,000 square miles, or 4,480,000 acres; and a total population, according to 
the last census, of 109,020, and distributed as to sex and nationality as follows: 
  
  Male. ous Total.

     French. Norwegian - Portuguese 
      
72,517 | 86,503 | 0,020 
    
The marked disparity between the sexes will be noted. The total number of 
males, 72,517, in the country is nearly double the total number of females (36,503). 
It will be observed that next to the total of native Hawaiians, 31,019, is the total of 
the Japanese population, 24,191. It appears that the Japanese have recently come 
in with great rapidity, as many as 2,000 arriving ina month. The Chinese (next 
in number to the Japanese) reached 21,616, making a total from Asia of 46,023, or 
nearly half (42 per cent) of the total, that is the Asiatics nearly equal in number 
all other nationalities.
-P-A-G-E-387
    EDUCATION IN HAWAII. 1515 
The total increase during the six years which elapsed since the previous census 
is 19,030, or 21.1 per cent. The diminution of the native Hawaiian populaticn, 
which has been long progressing, it appears, continues. In 1890 there were 34,433 
native Hawaiians; in 1896, 31,019, or a decrease of 9.9 per cent; from 1884 to 1890 
the loss was reported at 13.09 per cent. This reduction in the per cent of native 
Hawaiian loss is in. part accounted for by the greater care bestowed upon the 
younger generation, especially since the establishment of the Republic.

The number of pupils in the independent or private schools is 3,464, and the

schools, 62. 
During the two years covered by this report there were three Government 
schools, with a total of 59 pupils, taught in native Hawaiian. For the future it

appears that no schools will be taught in Hawaiian, and that all instruction at 
Government expense will be in English. © 
The school attendance in the islands in 1854 was 12,482; in 1878, it had run down 
to 6,252; as seen above, it has risen again to 12,616. In the last two years the 
increase has been specially rapid. : 
The attendance of pupils in Government schools is as follows:

The average for the whole group is 88.2 per cent. Honolulu has an average 
attendance of 88.6 per cent. The report adds the remark: ‘“‘New York has an 
average of 76 per cent; Columbus, Ohio, 80 per cent; San Francisco, 67 per cent; Los 
Angeles, which, because of its enrollment of 12,191, is practically the same as ours, 
has 78 per cent. If the comparison is made with the States instead of the cities 
the percentage of the Hawaiian group shows still more favorably. The State of 
New York has an average school attendance of 64 per cent, Ohio, of 72 per cent, 
and California 76 per cent. To enforce this attendance the board employs fifty 
truant officers, and it is very evident that the money spent in this direction has 
been well expended.” 
The need of increased school accommodations is emphasized. ‘In Honolulu 
every school is overflowing, and there are yet children who might be brought into 
school if we only had room for them.” 
The course of study resembles very much the courses in the several States of 
our Union. Sewing is taught the girls according to a carefully prepared plan 
of work. Nine establishments have been equipped for the manual training of 
boys. A young lady, native of the islands, educated at Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, 
N. Y., teaches drawing. More than half of the pupils are instructed in music. 
Under the inspiration of Mrs. 8. B. Cooper, of the Golden Gate Free Kindergarten 
Association, of San Francisco, a free kindergarten school was opened in Honolulu 
in March, 1894. Since then considerable progress has been made, A training 
tlass has been organized, and it is believed that the system is well grounded. 
Night-school work is favorably reported. 
A regular normal class has been attached to the high school. Of its members, 
8 are part Hawaiians, 8 Americans, 8 are British, 1 Hawaiian, and 1 Spanish.
-P-A-G-E-389
  EDUCATION IN HAWAIL 1517 
The report comments favorably on the quarterly meetings of the teachers held at 
various centers; also on the custom of visiting schools, It is affirmed that ‘“‘asa 
body the teachers of the Hawaiian Islands are a credit to the Republic. They 
have the future of the State under their control, and they are as a rule faithfully 
and conscientiously doing their work.” 
Teachers’ examinations are carefully conducted. First-class certificates are 
given for three years upon a minimum mark of 85 per cent; second-class certifi- 
cates are for two years, the minimum mark required being 75 per cent; and third- 
class certificates for one year with a minimum mark of 65 per cent. A life 
diploma has been granted to Mr. Armstrong Smith, who has spent over ten years 
of satisfactory and successful service in the public schools of the country. 
The report goes carefully into the details of the school work, public and private, 
in each island and each district. The attendance for the island of Oahu was 5,212, 
and in the city of Honolulu, the capital of the Republic, 4,305. Eight years ago 
there were in Honolulu only 2,329 pupils enrolled. Of the male teachers in the 
Government schools of that city, 6 are American and 4 are British; of the female 
teachers, 15 are part Hawaiians, 18 American, 10 British, 2 Scandinavian, 1 Portu- 
guese, and 1 Chinese. Of the special teachers, 1 is British and 1 is American. Of 
the entire number of teachers, 35 received their education, in whole or in part, in 
the Hawaiian schools. The Royal School is the largest of the Government English 
schools, with 469 pupils and 11 teachers. The largest independent school is St. 
Louis College, which enrolls 522 pupils. The high school is strongly commended. 
The most prominent of the independent schools is Oahu, ‘‘ which offers to its stu- 
dents a semiuniversity course.” The success of its pupils in the leading univer- 
sities of the United States speaks well of the training it gives. The Kamehameha 
classes grow in favor and do great credit to their munificent founders. <A girls’ 
department has been opened and has 59 pupils. Of the schools for girls, the largest 
is that kept by the Sisters of the Sacred Heart. It is a boarding and day school, 
and numbers 320 pupils. 
The Northern Pacific Missionary Institute has 8 Hawaiian students, 1 Portu- 
guese, and 1 Chinese. The regular course extends over three years; sometimes a 
fourth is added for a special study. Of the 36 pastors now serving the 55 evangel- 
ical churches, 25 are graduates of this institute. Six other graduates are engaged 
in the foreign missionary work in the Gilbert Islands. 
The expenditures of the board having charge of the schools for the twenty-one 
months ending December 31, 1895, are given as $270,856.08. A circular from the 
board calling attention to the clause of the constitution which declares that no 
public money shall be appropriated or public land conveyed to or for the support 
or benefit of any sectarian, denominational, or private school after a specified time, 
states that ‘‘ the board does not consider it consistent with the above principle to 
open the school every morning by repeating the Lord’s Prayer in unison,” calling 
attention to the declaration of the school law, which points out the object of the 
common schools supported by the Government, is to instruct the children of the 
Union in good morals; the report declares that ‘this includes honesty, truthful- 
ness, obedience to parents and teachers, respect for superiors in age and position, 
patriotism, kindness, benevolence, helpfulness to the weak and the unfortunate, 
humanity to animals, personal cleanliness, modesty, chastity, temperance, and 
other virtues which should be taught by precept, illustration, and example at all 
times. No profane or indecent language should be allowed in the school premises 
or on the way to or from school. Special instruction should also be given on the 
evils of the use of narcotics and of alcoholic drinks.” In all parts the system of 
schools exhibits the influence of American principles and methods, 
“The school law of June, 1896, revises the educational organization; there is no 
longer a separate cabinet officer for education. The secretary of foreign affairs is
-P-A-G-E-390
  1518 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
the head of the educational department and presides over its meetings and repre- 
sents it in the cabinet.” The administration of education is in the care of the 
above cabinet officer and six commissioners to be appointed by the President with 
the advice of the cabinet; ‘‘ ministers of religion are not eligible as commission- 
ers.” The commissioners elect one of their number as chairman to preside in the 
absence of the cabinet officer. They adopt all regulations and rules under the law 
for the employment of teachers and agents. They elect an inspector who devotes 
himself to the improvement of the schools and a secretary who keeps all records 
of the department. The organization is simple and aims to be effective in the 
administration of the remotest and smallest school. The law provides that pri- 
vate or independent schools must have a Government permit for their establish- 
ment, must conform to sanitary and hygienic requirements, must be opened to 
Government inspection, and that their teachers must have a Government certifi- 
cate as a guaranty of their good moral character and their qualification to teach’ 
The attendance of all children between 6 and 15 years of age, both inclusive, at 
either a public or private school is obligatory; except, first, when there is no 
school within 4 miles; second, when it is certified by a physician that the child 
is physically or mentally unable to attend; third, when the child is properly 
instructed at home by a tutor; fourth, when the child has passed required exam- 
inations. 
The English language shall be the medium and basis of instruction in all public 
and private schools, save where other languages are specially permitted by the 
department. Provision is made for teachers’ conventions and institutes. Text- 
books are furnished by law at cost price. The law requiring boys and girls to be 
taught separately is repealed. The revised school law is intended to put the 
utmost vigor into the administration and instruction of all grades of schools.

  Iii—THE INDIAN PROBLEM FROM AN INDIAN’S STANDPOINT. 
[The following is taken from an address delivered before the Fortnightly Club, 
of Chicago, by Dr. Carlos Montezuma, an Apache Indian from Arizona, and 
reputed to be a respected resident and successful practitioner in Chicago. His 
proposition for the solution of the Indian question, in view of his origin and pres- 
ent status, is entitled to consideration. ] 
The Indians of to-day are not the Indians of the past. They have been cut loose 
from the advantages of barbarism and thus far have net profited by civilization. 
This makes the Indians of the present more degraded than their forefathers ever 
were. 
Do you know that your whole effort has been and now is crowding them into 
depths of a state worse than barbarism? 
If you go on and hold down the latent power of the young Indian in the poison- 
ous tank of your present Indian system, the new picture will present a form that 
once glowed with health scarred by disease; the once open face and piercing eye 
will be filled with suspicion and fear; clear-cut feature is no longer there; the 
hands that pulled the bow are weakened by misuse and poisoned by vice. 
We Indians are struggling in the dark to find a way out. 
Ihave faced your civilized and uncivilized Indian in his own home, have inves- 
tigated the Indian school system on and off the reservations, and, above all, have I 
passed from the Apache grass hut through the different stages of development 
among enlightened people. 
Now I say more and more every year, I know that you are shortsighted in deal- 
ing with the Indian. Your mistakes have made him what he is to-day. 
My convictions come from intense interest, from personal observation. I have 
put all my thought into it. Most people have a wrong idea of the reservation; it 
is hot an earthly paradise nor a land of milk and honey, where the pipe of peace 
is continually smoked. It is a demoralized prison, a barrier against enlighten- 
ment, a promoter of idleness, beggary, gambling, pauperism, ruin, anddeath. It 
is a battlefield on which ignorance and superstition are massed against a thin 
skirmish line sent out from civilization. 
Five or ten Government employees at an agency or on a reservation can nevér 
elevateits thousands of Indians; on the contrary, you send teachers to elevate the 
Indians and in a few years these teachers become Indians in habits and thought. 
Would you isolate your children on a barren soil? 
» Would you surround them with ignorance and superstition? 
Would you put them among idlers, beggars, gamblers, paupers, and cowboys? 
Would you put around them the bowie knife, the revolver, and the bayonet? 
‘Would you deliberately place them away from any civilization whatever? 
If you did all this, would you expect them to be cultured, refined, intelligent, 
humane, and honest?
-P-A-G-E-393
  THE INDIAN PROBLEM. 1521 
Would you expect to make them industrious and self-supporting citizens? 
No; you would place them in the midst of the most refined, cultured, and edu- 
cated communities, among English-speaking people, where they could come face 
to face with all phases of civilized life, so that they might utilize and improve all 
their faculties. You would do this not merely for five years, but for all of their 
life time, and even then if they turned out well you would have a sense of relief. 
You are blinded and ignorant in the enjoyment of your civilized life. 
In the midst of your refinement and education you are without a trace of an 
idea of the real facts about the Indian question. You need to have the real con- 
ditions forcibly brought to you before you can realize your duty. 
Long-range education away from civilization is an utter failure. 
Five years of schooling is not education for the Indian boy any more than for 
the white boy. It is a mere whitewash education. The boy and girl go home 
and back to barbarism. 
To accomplish the elevation of the Indian, compulsory education will be neces- 
sary. This education should not be on reservations nor near them, but in your 
public schools. If the choice of my life had been left to my mother and father or 
myself, I would not be here. Ignorance and the very depths of barbarism would 
have been my fate. 
You are sympathetic and philanthropic; but your sympathy and philanthropy 
when exerted to the secluding of the Indians on the reservations are misplaced, 
It is unjust, it is inhuman; it is criminal to stun the Indian from his birth to his 
death. 
Would you give a child a few hundred @ollars a year to do with as it pleases? 
The Indians in their present state have become children. The intention of the 
people and the Government toward the Indian is good, but you can not cancel 
your obligation by giving him large money annuities. You feed able-bodied men 
and women; you take away the need of personal effort; you hold them in idleness; 
you encourage barbarism. Against these methods and this treatment I protest. 
You may care for the weak and helpless, but do not make strong men idle. 
Good people wish the Indians were like themselves, but think it cruel to change 
their relations and habits at once. 
There is a story that goes this way: 
There was a saint who had a dog; the dog had too long a tail. He concluded to 
cut the poor unfortunate’s tail off little by little so as not to hurt the dear dog too 
much. In much this way we are treating the Indians. Let us stop this destruc- 
tive policy. Let us cut the Gordian knot by the quickest way possible. Delay is 
ruin to my race. 
Does anyone say that this race is not endowed by nature with some great qual- 
ities which the Caucasian would do well to preserve? Yes, more, to imitate? 
Do I hear anyone say that the Indian has no fine qualities worth preserving? 
Do I hear this from anyone? If Ido, my words are not for him. 
Why do you not wipe out these dark reservations? Let the Indian earn his liv- 
ing in God’s appointed way, ‘‘by the sweat of his brow.” This is the only way 
to liberty, manhood, and citizenship. 
Some of these Indians, when brought into competition with white men, will die, 
you say. True; but that is what they are doing now. But, you say, they are 
wards of the nation, and we must deal honorably and justly with them. What 
you say is true, and you mean well, but to hear you speak of dealing honestly and 
justly with the Indian makes an Indian smile. 
You ask what shall be done with the reservations which the nation holds in 
trust for the Indian? I answer, sell them to bona fide settlers. What shall be 
done with the money? Use it, and more if necessary, for the education of every 
ED 97, 96

  1522 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Indian child or youth. Where and how would you educate them? Away with 
the reservation schools. Send all children to the most civilized communities, not 
in large masses, but scatter them in small classes over the United States, and 
place them in the public schools. Let them be brought up in and become citizens 
of the various States. But this would be cruel to take little children from their 
parents and natural protectors. True, I know about that, because it happened to 
me. But you ask, What right have we to take away a child from its Indian 
parents? I answer, It is done every day by the courts in the cases of white chil- 
dren whose parents are incapable of taking care of them. You can never civilize 
the Indian until you place him while yet young (and the younger the better) in 
direct relations with good civilization. When you do this with judgment, you 
will succeed and make him a useful citizen of the Republic. 
You have compromised and compromised with the Indians, fed and clothed 
them as children, and have kept them pent up away from civilization. You know 
the results. 
By leaving the education of the papooses to their ignorant and superstitious par- 
ents, you have encouraged the blind to lead the blind. The system is worse than 
afailure. And worst of all, you have done this carelessly and not without good 
motives. 
As an Indian, I thank God for helping hands that led me, step by step, perhaps 
not far, but at least to whereI am now. Had it not been for this, my fate would 
have been that of my people. The Indian children when transplanted must have 
friends who will give them advice, support, and encouragement. This will help 
them on over the difficulties. Small difficulties will seem to them like mountains. 
The reservation can never furnish the necessary conditions. The cure must 
come from association with enlightened Christian people. 
“Out of geographical barbarism into geographical civilization and citizenship” 
is the true war cry for the Indian of to-day. 
It is entirely practical to distribute all Indian children among your families, 
This has been done with great success. 
Four hundredand some odd thousand emigrants land upon your shores annually; 
in a few years they and their descendants are absorbed and lost sight of. This is 
because their children have the benefits of the public schools. 
Iwish that I could collect all the Indian children, load them in ships at San 
Francisco, circle them around Cape Horn, pass them through Castle Garden, put 
them under the same individual care that the children of foreign emigrants have 
in your public schools, and when they are matured and moderately educated, let 
them do what other men and women do—take care of themselves.

COEDUCATION. 
Coeducation, or the education of boys and girls in the same classes, is the general 
practice in the elementary schools of the United States. Exceptions to this rule 
are found in a few cities—less, apparently, than 6 per cent of the total number. 
In the majority of these cities the separation of boys and girls has arisen from the 
position or original arrangement of buildings, and is likely to be discontinued 
under more favorable conditions. Of the fifty principal cities enumerated by the 
census of 1890, four—namely, Philadelphia, Pa.; Newark, N. J.; Providence, R.1., 
and Atlanta, Ga.—report separation of the sexes in the high schools only; two cities 
of this class—San Francisco, Cal.,and Wilmington, Del.—reported, in 1892, separa- 
tion in all grades above theprimary. Insixcities—New Yorkand Brooklyn, N.Y.; 
Boston, Mass.; Baltimore, Md.; Washington, D.C., and Louisville, Ky.—both sepa- 
rate and mixed classes are found in all grades. Five cities of the second class 
having a population of 8,000 or more report separation of the sexes in the high 
schools, and ten cities of the same group separate classes in other grades. Of 
cities whose population is less than 8,000, nine report separate classes for boys and 
girls in some grades, 
Coeducation is the policy in about two-thirds of the total number of private 
schools reporting to this Bureau and in 65 per cent of the colleges and uniyer- 
sities. 
Foreign countries.—In England 65 per cent of the departments into which the 
elementary schools are divided have boys and girls in the same classes; in Scot- 
land, 97 per cent. Statistics for Ireland show that 51 per cent of the national 
schools have a mixed attendance of boys and girls. 
Separate education is the general policy in English schools of secondary grade, 
and where both sexes are admitted to the same school it is generally to separate 
departments. It is noticeable that the royal commission on secondary education 
advocate the extension of the coeducation policy. 
In the British colonies, with very few exceptions, both mixed and separate schools 
are found. In Ontario all the schools are mixed. In Quebec the schools for 
English children are, as a rule, mixed, but in those for the French the sexes are 
separated. In the Australasian colonies the tendency to separate departments for 
boys and girls is noticeable in cities. In Cape Colony, while nearly all schools are 
mixed, separate schools for girls are encouraged. 
In France custom and sentiment favor the separate education of boys and girls 
and the law requires every commune having above 500 inhabitants to establish a 
separate school for girls unless specially authorized to substitute therefor a mixed 
school. The attendance upon mixed schools slightly increased during the last 
decade, but not enough to indicate any decided change of sentiment in this respect. 
The mixed schools are seldom found in cities. 
1523 
   
-P-A-G-E-396
1524 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
The department of the Seine, which is occupied by Paris and its environs, 
reported in 1891-92 for public schools only 0.2 per cent of the pupils enrolled in 
mixed schools and for private schools 9.2 per cent. 
In secondary schools, public and private, separate education is the universal 
rule. 
Germany.—Separate education is the preferred policy in the German States, but 
is not practicable in the rural primary schools. According to statistics of 1891, 
in Prussia two-thirds of the children in the common schools were in mixed classes, 
but in the cities the proportion was only three-tenths. In Saxony only the two 
lowest classes are mixed, so that separation occurs generally at the tenth year of 
age—always by the twelfth. 
Other continental countries.— Similar conditions prevail in the remaining coun- 
tries of Europe, the tendency toward separation being most strongly marked in 
the Catholic countries. In Italy the law calls for separate schools for boys and 
girls, and if they attend at the same building it mast be in separate departments, 
each provided with its own entrance door. The lowest classes, however, may be, 
and often are, mixed. 
In Norway, and to a less extent in Denmark, girls are securing admission to sec- 
ondary schools formerly reserved for boys. 
The South American republics follow the precedent of the Latin States of Europe. 
Brazil, like Italy, requires separate schools for the two sexes. In 1888 the experiment 
of admitting boys and girls to the same class rooms was made in a few schools, 
but they were seated in different rooms outside of recitation hours. 
Coeducation in the universities of Europe.—The adverse vote of the senate of 
Cambridge University upon the proposition to admit women to the university 
degrees fixes for the present the status of women with respect to the two great 
English universities. The vote which was taken May 21, 1897, stood 1,707 against 
to 661 for the resolution. 
The university colleges established in England since 1868 are open to men and 
women. By the ‘universities act” of 1889 the Scotch universities were author- 
ized to open their doors to women. Edinburgh admits them to the classes with 
men. Glasgow has affiliated Queen Margaret College for women, and more 
recently (1895) opened all lectures in the faculty of artsto women. The University 
College of Dundee, affiliated to St. Andrews, is coeducational. 
In France women have never been legally deprived of university privileges, and 
since 1863, when the first woman was enrolled in the Paris faculties, the number 
of women matriculates has been gradually increasing. Women have recently 
been admitted to courses in the universities of Germany, Austria, and Hungary, 
special authorization being required in each individual case. 
The University of Athens was opened to women in 1890.

TEACHERS’ PENSIONS AND MUTUAL AID SOCIETIES. 
In all European countries in which the state supervises the school system and 
regulates the appointment of teachers, laws are in existence which provide for 
the teacher's support in old age and in cases of disability. The Annual Report of 
1894-95 gives detailed statements concerning amount of pension, time of service, 
age of beneficiary, etc., for European countries. (See Vol.1,pp. 1079-1108.) It is 
held there that teachers being officers of the state are, as such, entitled to pensions, 
especially since their salaries are, as a rule, smaller than in this country. But in 
no case in Europe does the state bear the whole burden of maintaining the pension 
fund, The teachers themselves have to pay a small percentage of their salaries 
toward maintaining the fund. It is estimated that on an average a teacher in 
Germany contributes himself about one-half of what he subsequently receives in 
form of pension. Besides pension funds the governments in Germany, Austria, 
and a few other countries maintain funds for the support of widows and orphans 
of teachers. Mutual aid societies which also pay annuities are established by the 
teachers themselves in many of the cities of central Europe. 
In the United States no teachers are pensioned from public funds. Voluntary 
beneficial associations have been formed in some cities, and in other localities 
specified below. State laws provide for similar ends in a similar way, the essen- 
tial difference being that in the latter case participation is enforced upon all teach- 
ers. The following paragraph shows the varieties of organization, etc.: 
Voluntary mutual benefit associations for temporary aid only exist in Baltimore, 
St. Louis, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago, Buffalo, San Francisco, St. 
Paul, and one interstate association. These call for $1 to $2 initiation fee; $1 to 
$5 annual dues. Special assessments of $1 are made in some cases. Benefits in 
sickness range from 50 cents a day to $10 a week; at death funeral expenses only 
are paid in some instances, and in others a sum equal to $1 from each member of 
the association. 
Associations for annuity, or retirement fund only, are in New York, Boston, and 
Baltimore, and there is an annuity guild in Massachusetts. The initiation fees 
reported are $3 to $5. The annual dues are 1 to 14 per cent of salary up to $18 or 
$20. The annuity is from 60 per cent of salary to $600 a year. Time of service 
required for retirement is from two to five years with disability, or from thirty- 
five to forty years without disability. 
Associations for both temporary aid and annuity exist in Hamilton County 
(Cincinnati), Philadelphia, Brooklyn, and District of Columbia. Initiation fees, 
$1 to $10; annual dues $5 to $40. Annuity, $5 per week to $600 per year, and $100 
for funeral expenses in case of death. Temporary aid, during illness, $5 or $6 
per week. Time of service required for retirement is two to five years with dis- 
ability, or thirty-five to forty years without disability. 
Pension or retirement funds are authorized by State legislatures for St. Louis, 
all cities in California, Brooklyn, New York City, Detroit, Chicago, all cities in 
New Jersey, Cincinnati, and Buffalo. Dues vary little; they are generally 1 per 
cent of salary. Annuity, $250 to one-half of salary; maximum, $1,200. Minimum 
length of service with disability, twenty to thirty years; without disability, 
twenty-five to thirty-five years.

1534 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
FOREIGNERS IN UNIVERSITIES OF CENTRAL EUROPE. 
_ The numbers given in the following summary are the latest available; they are 
for the scholastic year 1894-95, 
A glance at the totals shows that the number of foreigners studying in Ger- 
many is not inconsiderable. It must be borne in mind, however, that the num- 
bers given represent only those of matriculated students, for those are the only 
ones who can be considered in official reports. Tho number of those who visit 
German institutions as hearers for some length of time, and without being 
matriculated, attend clinics, work in laboratories, and listen to private lectures, 
is very large, but can not be stated with accuracy. It is estimated that that 
number exceeds those of matriculated foreigners. In the summer of 1895 the 
universities and other institutions of learning in Germany had upon their rolls 
the names of 8,362 foreigners. That is, in comparison to the total number of 
matriculated students, equal to 8.48 per cent. Of these 3,362 foreigners the uni- 
versities proper had 2,015 (7 per cent), the polytechnica 1,041 (13.1 per cent), the 
veterinary schools 15 (1.53 per cent), the agricultural academies 101 (9.37 per 
cent), the forestry academies 58 (18.6 per,cent), and the mining academies 132 
(82.4 per cent). Of the 3,362 foreigners there were 966 Russians, 514 Americans, 
467 Austrians and Hungarians, 346 Swiss, 180 Englishmen, 158 Hollanders, 142 
Bulgarians, 116 Swedes and Norwegians, 82 Roumanians, 69 Italians, 57 Asiatics, 
58 Frenchmen, 37 Servians, 36 Belgians, 36 Turks, 27 Greeks, 26 Danes, 22 Afri- 
cans, 14 Australians, 8 Spaniards, 4 Portuguese, and 2 Montenegrins. 
In the Austrian universities and other institutions there were matriculated 
1,106 foreigners in the summer of 1895 among a total of 18,031 students, or 6.14 
per cent. Of these 1,106 foreigners there were 987 (6.58 per cent) students of uni- 
versities, the polytechnica had 84 (3.1 per cent), the mining academies i6 (7 per 
cent), and the agricultural academy in Vienna had 19 (7.66 per cent). The 1,106 
foreigners consisted of 239 Germans, 236 Russians, 115 Servians, 111 Italians, 106 
Americans, 76 Roumanians, 71 Bulgarians, 83 Turks, 31 Englishmen, 25 Swiss, 11 
Greeks, 10 Frenchmen, 9 Hollanders, 9 Swedes and Norwegians, 8 Africans, 6 
Belgians, 6 Asiatics, 3 Spaniards, and 1 Montenegrin. 
The Swiss higher seats of learning matriculated no less than 1,667 foreigners 
among a total of 3,908 students. The percentage of foreigners here was 42.6, 
The universities alone enrolled 1,841, or 42.2 per cent, and the polytechnical school 
in Ziirich 326, or 43 per cent, of a total number of the matriculated students. Of 
the 1,667 foreigners Germany had sent 549, Russia 399, Austria-Hungary 143, 
Bulgaria 187, Roumania 86, Italy 68, America 65, France 63 3, Asia 26, Holland 25, 
Turkey 22. , England 20, Greece 19, Servia a Sweden and Nor way 15, Denmark 5, 
Belgium 3, Portugal 2, “Africa 2, Spain 1. 
From these summaries it is seen that as far as attendance of foreigners is con- 
cerned, Switzerland ranks first with 42.6 per cent of the total number; then follows 
Germany, with 8.48 per cent, and lastly Austria, with 6.14 percent. This doesnot, 
as has been said before, include the so-called free lances whovattend these higher 
seats of learning only for a time and who, being without proper preparation, can 
not matriculate, hence can not be counted as students by the officers of the insti- 
tutions. They have, as a matter of self-evidence, most of the privileges of the stu- 
dents by becoming the private students of renowned professors, and have access to 
the libraries, laboratories, experimental stations, and other accessories which are 
open to those who can pay the fees. In Germany itis the mining academies which 
are, comparatively, attended most frequently by foreigners (32.4 per cent), and 
the veterinary schools are attended least by foreigners (1.53 per cent). The pro- 
portion of foreigners in German universities has risen from 5,16 per cent in the 
year 1880 to 8.48 per cent in 1895, In Austria the school of agriculture in Vienna 
as the greatest proportion of foreigners, namely, 7.66 per cent, while the poly- 
technica have only 8.1 per cent. In Switzerland universities and the polytechnical 
school are attended by foreigners at about an equal ratio. 
In France efforts are being made to invite foreign students, especially from 
America, to attend the higher 1 institutions of learning of thatcountry. Admission 
tothese institutions has been made easier and the academic degrees which formerly 
were only given to French students have been made accessible. A communication 
of the United States ambassador to France, Gen. Horace Porter, to the State 
Department, dated January 11, 1898, in answer to an inquiry in regard to the 
admission of a student from the United States into the School of Mines, contains 
statements which are applicable to other higher seats of learning also, He says: 
“No foreign student can enter any of the schools of France—medicine, phar- 
macy, dentistry, veterinary, painting, design, architecture, music, declamation, 
engineering, etc.—without the formal application of the diplomatic representative 
of this country. In most cases two letters suffice, one making application, the

other expressing thanks when the request is granted. Sometimes more corres- 
pondence is necessary, for the reason that those proposing to enter any of the high- 
grade schools have to produce certain certificates of studies or diplomas, which the 
authorities accept only when they come through the embassy. These rules, says 
General Porter, apply to all foreign students, No discrimination is made against 
Americans; on the contrary, the authorities extend all possible facilities to them. 
There is a large number of American students in Paris, and, as a rule, they are 
much liked by the teachers in French institutions, 
«¢ As for the School of Mines,” he continues, ‘‘ foreigners can be admitted there 
either as foreign pupils, in which case they have to stand an examination, or as 
free auditors, in which case there is no examination. The courses, however, are 
not all open to that class of students, and no diploma is granted them. In both 
cases they have to pay 50 francs ($9.65) for matriculation, If the school is full, as 
occasionally happens, the application for admission is put off until the next year.” 
THE CONVEYANCE OF CHILDREN TO SCHOOL. 
The practice of discontinuing weak schools and of conveying the pupils at the 
public expense to stronger central schools continues to give favorable results 
and promise of further extension in the near future. 
The development of the electric trolley-car system, the bicycle, and the move- 
ment in favor of good roads are all working in the direction of furnishing suit-. 
able graded-school advantages to the children in the rural districts. 
“The money saved in a small town by reducing the number of teachersis often 
large enough to furnish better school accommodations to the children, better 
wages to better teachers for them, such transportation as consolidation requires, 
and longer schooling.” State Superintendent Hill, of Massachusetts, presents 
thus briefly the economical advantages of conveyance.! 
The following States have made legal provision for transporting children to 
school at the public expense: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, 
Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Iowa, and Nebraska. 
The State superintendents of Rhode Island and Wisconsin have declared that 
the existing provisions of the school laws of their respective States are sufficient 
to authorize the conveyance of pupils at the public expense. Certain counties 
of Ohio are authorized by special laws to establish central schools and convey 
pupils to and from them, and excellent results have followed the adoption of this 
policy. 
Some progress has also been made in this direction in Pennsylvania and South 
Dakota, and perhaps in other States, where there already exists, as in Penn- 
sylvania, ‘law enough to cover the case.”

results of experience, etc., see Reports of this office for 1894-95, Volume 2, pages

HIGHER COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 
The immense progress the natural sciences, technology, and transportation 
have made in recent years has given to the commercial profession an importance 
which could not be foreseen in former years. More than ever before has it become 
the merchant’s duty to act as middleman between producer and consumer. In 
ever widening circles he has to bring the products of agriculture and industry to 
their proper markets. By means of increased taxation to which commercial enter- 
prises are subject they support ever more strongly the State in the discharge of 
its civilizing efforts. Direct exchange between producer and consumer has almost

  1536 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
wholly ceased, and the percentage of the population devoted to commercial pur- 
suits has increased considerably in every civilized country. 
It seems worthy of mention that at present the Governments everywhere in 
Europe are urged strongly by commercial men to establish more higher commer- 
cial schools and support them exclusively from State funds. Itis argued that the 
State provides higher technological, industrial, agricultural, forestry, and mining 
academies for leaders in technical pursuits, agriculture, etc., while for the mer- 
cantile branch no State institution exists. The merchants feel that the education 
of their assistants is not of such a high order as that of the members of other 
callings, and they attribute it to the want of institutions of a high order. At 
present the commercial branch is entirely dependent for the best preparation of 
its members upon higher schools established by local authority or private enter- 
prise—institutions which charge high tuition fees, hence are attended by wealthy 
young men only. This opinion has found expression in legislatures and parlia- 
ments, where it was urged that much greater demands are made now than 
formerly, owing to freer commercial movement all over the civilized world, and it 
would therefore seem wise if the State authorities paid more attention to proper 
preparation of men who might become leaders in commerce, as the State prepares 
leaders in every other field of human exertion. 
Moved by these considerations, several European Governments have of late years 
bestowed much attention upon commercial training of young men, and the results 
thus far obtained give assurance that the further development of schools for that 
purpose will be commensurate with the demands of the times. 
In Germany particularly the commercial secondary schools have developed with 
the aid of provincial and State support, till at last a university has opened its 
doors for higher commerclal education. On February 22, 1898, the University of 
Leipzig received an addition to its various courses in the shape of a higher com- 
mercial course. The particulars may be found on page 1498 of this report. In 
connection with this it may be remarked that the cities of Magdeburg and Cologne 
are making earnest efforts to establish independent commercial universities. In 
Italy the State subsidizes the higher commercial school at Venice, reserving the 
privilege of having its consuls and consular agents prepared at that school. In 
Belgium the Government chooses its consuls from the graduates of the higher 
commercial school at Antwerp. 
GRADUATE WORK AT UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES. 
The number of students who remain at college pursuing advanced studies after 
having completed undergraduate courses leading toa bachelor’s degree is con- 
stantiy increasing. In the year 1876-77 the number of such students was 389; in 
1886-87 the number was 1,237, while in 1896-97 there were reported 4,919 graduate 
students in attendance at the various institutions of the country, 1/413 of whom 
were women. 
These numbers do not include the students who remain at college for the pur- 
pose of pursuing professional studies in law, medicine, theology, etc. The Hand- 
book of Graduate Courses, published by the Federation of Graduate Clubs, shows 
the popularity of the various studies among graduate students. It shows that of 
3,204 students in attendance at 24 of the leading institutions of the country 35.4 
per cent were pursuing language and literature studies, 20.6 per cent historical and 
social sciences, 18 per cent philosophical studies, 14.2 per cent natural sciences, 
and 11.1 per cent mathematical sciences. 
The following table shows the number of resident graduate students in the 
universities and colleges of the United States each year for 25 years:

CURRENT QUESTIONS. 1537 
CORPORAL PUNISHMENT. 
No principle of school government is now more constantly impressed upon 
teachers than that frequent whippings indicate a poor disciplinarian. Only the 
older men and women of this generation can realize what a change from the past 
this represents. 
In one entire State, New Jersey, the teacher is forbidden by law to inflict cor- 
poral punishment. No other State goes to this length, but Illinois, Kansas, Mis- 
sissippi, Montana, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Washington, and West Virginia 
specifically prescribe a penalty for excess amounting to cruelty. Legal punish- 
ment would be meted out toa brutal teacher in the other States just as surely as 
in these, but resort would be had to the common law and not to a statute. Only 
in Arizona is there formal statutory authority for corporal punishment; but whip- 
ping has been the common mode of discipline in school from time immemorial; 
custom legalizes it, and unless forbidden in express terms the teacher does not 
need the authority of a special permissive law. Judicial decisions to this effect 
have been made in Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Min- 
nesota, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and probably in other States. 
Local school boards have always the implied power to make regulations for the 
order and discipline of their respective schools, and three States, viz, Michigan, 
New York, and Pennsylvania, expressly grant them this power. Acting under 
this power, expressed or implied, several cities, notably, New York City, Chicago, 
and Albany, have prohibited absolutely the use of the rod. The same is true of 
Providence, R. I., except in the primary grades, and in them whipping must not 
be inflicted unless the written consent of the parent or guardian has been pre- 
viously filed with the city superintendent. 
Corporal punishment may be used as a last resort and under rigid regulations 
as to reports, etc., in a great many cities, among them being Baltimore, Detroit, 
Indianapolis, Louisville, Minneapolis, New Orleans, Pittsburg, Rochester, St. 
Louis, San Francisco, and Worcester. In some cities where there is no formal 
prohibition, such a strong sentiment has grown up against corporal punishment 
that it is rarely or never inflicted. Philadelphia is a conspicuous example of this. 
SALARIES OF TEACHERS. 
The expenditure for salaries in the public schools, teachers and superintendents 
both included, was $116,377,778 in 1896, or 63.1 per cent of the total expenditure 
for school purposes. 
Official reports present average salaries, or the data for their estimate, but these 
averages, although possessing a certain value, tend in a measure to obscure the 
facts. Few superintendents distinguish between urban and rural salaries, hence 
the averages, low as they may seem, impart an exaggerated idea of the latter and 
at the same time effectually conceal the advantages of the former. Only one- 
seventh of the teachers are in city schools, but cities pay about 86 per cent of the 
amount expended for teaching. The relative value of a low salary may, indeed, 
be greater than that of a higher. Many conditions must be weighed before any 
just comparisons can be established in this respect, either between States or 
between different nations. The complaint is general, both in the United States 
and in European countries, that salaries are too low. So far as averages show it, 
the present condition in the United States is as follows: For the entire country 
the average monthly salary of men teachers is $47.37; of women $40.24. The 
several geographical sections differ considerably in this respect, and the difference 
is emphasized when the individual States are considered. The highest average 
for men is in the North Atlantic section, $61.87, and here also is the greatest differ- 
ence between the average for men and the average for women, i.e., $16.37. The 
explanation is to be found in the concentrated population which supports large 
graded schools and numerous high schools. The consolidation of rural schools, 
involving the transportation of pupils at public expense to a central place, tends 
to the same result. Wherever employed it has raised salaries without increasing 
the total cost of the schools. The lowest average salaries and the least variance 
between the averages for men and women are found in the South Atlantic section. 
The averages are for men $33.15 and for women $30.66. 
The length of the school year must be considered in determining the annual salary. 
This period averages for the whole country 140.5 days, or about 7 months of 20 
days each, and ranges from 93 days in the South Central Division to 175.5 days in 
the North Atlantic. As to the movement of salaries it is, apparently, upward, but 
ED 97. 97

  1538 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
this is to be inferred rather from general statements than from any exact data 
attainable. 
It is evident that the relative increase or decrease in the average salaries of men 
and women from year to year signifies nothing, unless the estimates be based upon 
the same positions for the period considered. If a man resigns from a position a 
woman may be promoted at a lower salary. Interchanges like this are constantly 
taking place with the apparent effect of increasing the average salary for men and 
Suoiniehing that for women, or vice versa, when in fact no individual salary is 
affected. 
The kind of data necessary for a comparative estimate of the changing rates for 
men and women is illustrated in the Commissioner's Report for 1889-90 (Vol. 2, 
chap. 2). This is probably the first attempt at a systematic investigation of this 
particular and constitutes thus an original contribution to sociological science. 
It is scarcely possible with the present data at hand to attempt any comparison 
between the average salaries of teachers in our own and-other countries; but, 
keeping in mind the absence of a fixed or uniform standard of relation, it may be 
interesting to note that the average annual salary for men in the United States, 
counting seven months to the school year, is $331.50 and for women $281.68. The 
average annual salary for teachers in the Prussian elementary schools was esti- 
mated at $340 in 1887, including free residence. Dr. Schlee, of Altoona, observes 
that “in making a comparison it must be remembered that the advantage of 
permanency connected with positions in Germany does not exist in America. 
‘There are no pensions and stipends after death. Salaries are wages calculated and 
paid by the month, consisting of four school weeks; vacation months are not 
included. Salaries do not continue during interruption of duties by leave of 
absence or sickness. 
In France the Government guarantees a minimum salary toevery teacher. The 
teachers are graded in five classes and the minimum annual salary ranges from 
$200 to $400 for men and from $200 to $320 for women. In addition every teacher 
must be provided with a house or with a money equivalent for the same. The 
policy of an assured minimum salary is advocated to some extent in the United 
States; in New York a bill to this effect has been carried through the legislature 
and awaits the governor’s signature. 
TEXT-BOOKS—SELECTION AND SUPPLY. 
In a few States text-books do not form a specific subject of legislation, but local 
boards have control, under the general charge of the welfare of the schools. 
In most States legislation regulates the selection of text-books, 
In some States a guaranty is required from publishers to supply books, accord- 
ing to samples, at wholesale, retail, introduction, exchange, mail prices, part or 
all, for a term of years. 
In fewer States the school boards buy and sell the books on public account. In 
certain States boards continue to own the books used free by pupils. Indigent 
pupils are more frequently supplied at public expense. 
In most States special or general laws give cities the control of the details of 
their school administration, including text-books. 
Specific penalties are expressed in certain cases for using other than prescribed 
books, but in general such use would be only a violation of law to be dealt with 
as it occurred. 
Free text-books are furnished in Delaware, District of Columbia, Idaho, Maine, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, 
Rhode Island, and Vermont.

  THE LOCAL UNIT OF SCHOOL ORGANIZATION. 
The State exercises remote authority over all public schools in ‘its borders; the 
county, in most States, has a closer supervision of all schools in its limits, but has 
very little to do with schools in New England. In certain States it becomes the 
unit for the entire local administration of public schools. The town or township 
takes more or less of the local functions in other States, and the district becomes 
a local unit for variable functions in yet others, In 85 counties of Texas is a com- 
munity system. The summarized statement below shows the principal agency 
through which local support and control of schools is exercised, special laws 
excepted, under which cities, towns,and independent districts exist. Counties 
generally receive, hold, and disburse moneys for townships and districts formed 
by subdivision of counties; towns or townships generally hold the same relation 
to districts formed by division of-town or townships; in afew States districts have 
their own tax collectors and treasurers. 
County.—Alabama is all either town or township. Florida, with provision for 
districts of united power; Georgia, Louisiana, recognizing Congressional town- 
ships in accounts of 16th-section land funds; Maryland, Mississippi, with provision 
for separate districts; North Carolina, with districts capable of holding real estate ; 
Tennessee, with some local functions in districts, and only supervisory powers in 
subdistricts; Utah, with provision for division. 
Town or township.—Alabama, the Congressional township for administrative 
convenience, its officers appointed and its accounts kept by county officers ; Con- 
necticut, the town may abolish districts; Illinois, township based on Congressional 
township, or district optional; Indiana, New Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, each 
township, incorporated town or city (or borough in Pennsylvania), district corpo- 
ration for school purposes; Iowa, township based on Congressional township with

  CHAPTER XXXIV. 
THE GROWTH OF TORONTO CHILDREN. 
By Franz Boas. 
INTRODUCTION, 
In 1891, when active preparations for the World’s Columbian Exposition were 
being made, Prof. F. W. Putnam, curator of the Peabody Museum of American 
Archeology and Ethnography, and chief of the Department of Anthropology of 
the Exposition, placed me in charge of the section of Physical Anthropology. 
At an early time during the preparation of the exhibits we agreed upon a plan to 
represent as fully as possible the growth and the development of American chil- 
dren. Valuable material was available, but it seemed desirable to extend the inves- 
tigations over regions in which heretofore no observations had been collected. 
I submitted our plans to Mr. James Hughes, superintendent of public schools in 
Toronto, Ontario, and to Prof. Earl Barnes, of Leland Stanford Junior Univer- 
sity. Through the interest taken by these gentlemen I have been enabled to 
obtain series of measurements of the school children of Toronto and of Oakland, 
Cal. The former series was taken under the supervision of Dr. Alexander F. 
Chamberlain, the latter under the direction of Prof. Earl Barnes. In both of 
these series the same plan, excepting details, was followed. 
In the following pages I intend to present some of the results of our investiga- 
tions upon the children of Toronto, together with a few general statements which 
the treatment of the material and a study of the questions involved suggest. 
Since in previous investigations the influence of sex, of occupation of parents, 
and of descent had been studied, it seemed desirable to investigate the influence 
of other causes. I selected for this purpose the influence of the order of birth, 
i. e., the question whether first-born children have a development different from 
that of later-born children. 
The blank on which the observations were recorded was drawn up so as to 
cover not only this point, but also the influence of nationality and occupation 
of the parents—facts which it was necessary to note in order to determine their 
influence on the questions to be investigated. Blue blanks were used for females, 
white blanks for males. Here is a copy of both sides of the blank:

EXPLANATION OF MEASUREMENTS. 
1._ Height standing.—Let the person stand close to the wall in front of the measuring rod. His 
heels must be close together, touching the wall, and he must stand perfectly straight, looking 
straight ahead without raising or dropping the chin, the head touching the wall. Read off the 
height of the crown of the head by means of the triangle, pressing one side against the rod, the 
other against the crown of the head. 
2. Height sitting.—Put a low, level seat (for instance, a small wooden box) in front of the meas- 
uring rod. Let the person sit on it so that his knees are about 5 inches higher than the seat, 
which is accomplished by making the seat sufficiently low, or by using a footstool. Let the per- son sit far back, close to the wall, peopine his back erect against the wall. He must look straight 
ahead without raising or dropping the chin, the head touching the wall. Give the heights of 
the seat and of the crown of the head. 
3. Finger-reach.—Let the person touch a vertical post or wall with the second finger of one 
hand, and stretch along the measuring rod as far as he can reach. The rod must be held hori- 
zontally at right angles to the wall, in front of the body, along the median line of the arms. 
Let the person make the greatest possible efforts in stretching out his arms before you read off 
the figures. 
4, The weight is to be taken in ordinary indoor costume. 
The instrument used was a rod divided into 210 centimeters.! The index arm 
was a separate piece, consisting of a wooden angle, the sides of which were long 
enough to insure perfect contact with the measuring rod and with the crown of 
the head of the person being measured. The head measurements were taken by 
carefully trained observers; the others by the teachers. The personal data were 
given by the parents of the children. Owing to the peculiar social conditions 
prevailing in Toronto, certain groups of the population are represented by very 
few individuals. This is true particularly in regard to the French population, the 
greater part of whose children seem to attend the parochial schools. There are 
also very few children of the professional classes included in our material. 
The success of the collection of measurements is largely due to the assistance 
extended by Mr. James Hughes, and to the lively interest on the part of the teach- 
ers who undertook the arduous task of obtaining the necessary information from 
the parents, and who took many of themeasurements. To all of them my thanks 
are due. I have also to thank Dr, Alexander F. Chamberlain for the efficient 
management of the whole undertaking. 
THE METHODS OF TREATING STATISTICS OF GROWTH. 
The treatment of anthropometrical observations, particularly of growing chil- 
dren, offers peculiar difficulties. During the past years a vast number of observa- 
tions referring to the growth of children have been accumulated. The method of 
treating the results of such observations has largely been a comparison of averages 
and of the frequency of occurrence of measurements between certain limits; for 
instance, frequency of occurrence of statures from inch toinch or of weights from 
pound to pound. It is generally assumed that these figures express immediately 
the physiological facts relating to growth. 
In almost all cases the observations have been taken only once, and on a great 
number of individuals, not repeatedly through a long number of years on the 
same individuals. For this reason the series, when arranged according to years, 
will not be homogeneous. The younger groups contain many individuals who 
will not reach the adult stage, while the older classes contain only few individuals 
who will die before becoming adults. When we assume the whole series to be 
homogeneous, we imply that the value of the measurement under consideration 
has no relation to the liability to die at a certain age, which assumption seems to 
be very doubtful. Without considering details, it would seem very likely that 
individuals far remote from the average, who show either too small or too large 
measurements, approach the limits between pathological and physiological varia- 
tion, and are therefore more likely to die. This would imply a greater variability 
of the measurements of deceased individuals of a certain age than of living indi- 
viduals of thesameage. The series of living individuals of all ages can be equally 
constituted only when the measurements of the living and of the deceased show 
the same values. This fact has already been pointed out by H. Westergaard.? 
There are a few series of observations which seem to make the identity of the 
series of measurements of the living and of the deceased individuals of the same 
age veryimprobable. The most important among these is the peculiar decrease in 
the brain weight in males after the twentieth year. This can hardly be explained 
in any other way than by assuming an increased death-rate among men with very 
large brains at an age of about 20 years.

THE GROWTH OF TORONTO CHILDREN. 1543 
Bowditch and Roberts have shown that, on the average, children of well-to-do 
parents are taller and heavier than those of poorer parents. Carlier has shown 
the same phenomenon by proving that a number of children of a certain class, 
when brought under more favorable conditions—in his case into a military train- 
ing school—grow more rapidly than the rest, who were left in their former con- 
ditions. The mortality of children is greater among the poorer classes than 
among the well-to-do classes. Therefore among the young children a greater 
percentage of the individuals measured belongs to the poorer classes, whose chil- 
dren are at the same time shorter of stature than among the older children. This 
et eects undoubtedly the averages of measurements collected in our public 
schools, 
It does not seem unlikely that the correlation between measurements and mor- 
tality is more strongly emphasized at certain periods than at others. If, for 
instance, many individuals of retarded growth should die during the period of 
adolescence, this might give the real explanation of the curious overlapping of 
the curves of growth of boys and girls, the girls between about the twelfth and 
fourteenth years being heavier and taller than boys of thesameage. Iam strength- 
ened in this opinion by the observation, made by Dr. G. M. West, that the extent of 
this period and the amount of overlapping are the smaller the more favorable the 
conditions under which the individuals live. Itwould be interesting in this connec- 
tion to study the curves of growth of a people which has a very high death-rate 
among young children.! 
Social causes are apt to introduce other complications which restrict the com- 
parability of the results. The poorer classes do not send their children to school 
as long and as regularly as the well-to-do; consequently their proportionate num- 
peramong the school children decreases steadily, and this changing composition of 
the series must affect the results of the measurements. 
The state of health of the children also affects the series, particularly during 
the first and last years. Weak children will be sent to school later than strong 
children, and the teachers will be inclined not to promote them as rapidly as 
strong children, so that the oldest school children will include an undue propor- 
tion, not only of those who are dull, but also of those who have been of weak 
health during a portion of their life. 
For all these reasons, investigations based on single observations of children of 
various ages do not give us results which can be considered to indicate with the 
highest accuracy attainable the processes of human growth. The series for the 
various years differ in composition, and the physiological constants are therefore 
modified to a greater or less extent by a variety of disturbing factors. In order 
to obtain the physiological results with the greatest accuracy, the material. upon 
which we base our studies must be made homogeneous. This can be accomplished 
in two ways. A very large number of children may be measured once; and year 
after year those who die and those who on account of social reasons are removed 
from the field of observation must be eliminated from the list. When all have 
become adults, the remaining individuals and those who dropped out for various 
reasons must be treated separately. But the best way would be to take measure- 
ments of a large series of children at stated intervals, as in this manner the fullest 
information on the manner of growth will be given, and as these repeated meas- 
urements furnish all the necessary material for subdividing the series so that each 
division will be homogeneous. 
These limitations must be borne in mind in interpreting results of a single set 
of observations on children of various ages, or, to use Hertel’s term, in interpreting 
results obtained by the generalizing method. 
Besides this, certain corrections must be made which heretofore haye not received 
sufficient attention. The number of children of various ages who have been meas- 
uredis not equal. All the series begin with comparatively fewchildren. The num- 
ber increases from year to year until, beginning with the tenth or eleventh year, it 
decreases again. Thechange of numbers is not equal in the two sexes. It follows, 
from this fact, that among 6-year-old children, for instance, there are in the 
measured series more of the age of 6 yearsand 11 months than of 6 yearsexactly; and 
that, on the other hand, among the 15-year-old children there are more of the age of 
15 years exactly than of 15 yearsand 11 months. In treating the various series of 
observations, all children between 6 and? years,7 and 8 years, etc., or all the children 
between 6} and 74 years, etc., have been grouped together and the series is assumed 
to represent. the sizes for the average ages, i. e., 6.5 years, 7.5 years, ete., or, in 
the other case, 6, 7,8 years. On account of the varying frequency of the several 
months this is not quite correct. Among the young children the average will be

Similar deviations from the assumed average of period would be found in all 
the existing series if the material were arranged according to months instead of 
being grouped for the whole year. The error resulting from this source may be 
very easily corrected by adding to the average a correction proportional to the 
deviation of period. The following consideration will show this method to be 
correct. The material may be divided into periods so short that we may assume 
no growth worth considering to take place from beginning to end of each period, 
say, for instance, according to weeks. Then we may obtain the correct average 
for the whole year by taking the average of each period and adding to it a correc- 
tion corresponding to the time that has to elapse or has elapsed between the mid- 
dle of the year and the period. Let these averages for the periods 1,2,3.... be

In combining these, we must give each the weight corresponding to the number 
of cases, 7,, 72, 2, . ++ + , from which itis derived. Let be the total number of

As a,is the average of all the values of the period 1, we have a, =, where s,

The sum of all the s is evidently equal to the sum total of all the observations 
during the year, which we will call S. 
a=S 4 att tah tee. n n 
The last quotient in the equation is the average of all the periods, which is multi- 
plied by the annual increment d. We have therefore the average value for the 
year equal to the average of all the observations, plus a correction which is equal 
to the annual increment multiplied by the difference between the average period 
for all the observations and the full or half year, as the case may be. 
While the average may be corrected in this manner without much difficulty, 
the variability of the series for the whole year is affected in a much more complex 
manner. We will suppose that the variability did not change much in the course 
of one year, which at certain periods of life is, however, not the case. Since the 
values of the average increase from month to month, it is clear that the range of 
variation for the early periods must begin at a lower point than for the later 
periods, so that the variation for the total year covers a wider range than the 
variations at a given moment do. 
As an example I will give here the distribution of observations of 8-year-old 
girls, first in periods of three months, then for the whole year, with their averages 
and the means of the squares of deviations.

The average of the variability of the four aerate is -L5.34, while that for the 
total year is +.5.50, a very considerable difference, which will be the greater, 
the more rapid the growth or the more rapid the change of variability during the 
year. 
Previous investigations have shown that variability decreases very rapidly in 
the period of adolescence. During this time itis imperative to divide the series 
according to intervals shorter than years in order to obtain results that bring out 
the physiological relations clearly. 
We will call the variability at any given period ¢ of a certain year 4; the aver- 
age value of the measurement for the same period, Aj. The sum of the squares 
of all the deviations for this period, divided by the number of observations 7 for 
this period, will then be

It might seem that this correction could be better made by adding the propor- 
tionate amount of growth to the measurement of each individual, i. e., for those 
of 6 years 0 months, for instance, the amount of 6 months’ growth if the measure- 
ments are to be reduced to the period of 6 years 6 months. This, however, must 
not be done, as small children grow differently from tall children, and therefore 
the amount of growth to be added differs for the various values of the measure- 
ment. That this is the case has been proved by Dr. Henry G. Beyer.’ I collected 
some statistics on this subject in Worcester, Mass., the results of which are briefly 
given here. I am indebted to Dr. G. M. West for many of the measurements, 
while others were taken by myself. The first series was taken in May, 1891. The 
second series was repeated in May, 1892. I give first the series of annual increases _ 
which were obtained in Worcester.

That there must be en interdependence between the rate of growth and the 
actual size attained at a certain period can be shown to be a theoretical necessity. 
If the variability of a series at the age ¢ is u, and if the variability of the annual 
increment d is m, then, according to the theory of probabilities, the variability at 
the age ¢-++1 must be Yy?-+ m2 if the amount of annual growth does not depend 
upon the size attained at the period ¢. Observations show that m is small as com- 
pared to #._ Observations also show that / first increases quite rapidly from year 
to year, and that at the period of adolescence it suddenly decreases very rapidly. 
It is clear that these phenomena do not agree with the assumption made. We 
must conclude, therefore, that the amount of annual growth depends upon the 
size attained at a certain period. 
It is possible to give an approximate value of this relation. If the average of all 
measurements for the period ¢ is A, that for the period t, is A-+-d, where d is the 
average amount of growth for the period ¢,—¢. We will consider in what man- 
Ber ebvalae A-+d-+v in the series of the period t, develops from the series of the 
eriod t, 
2 We will suppose that the relation between the actual size of an individual and 
the average amount of his annual growth is expressed by the simple relation   
d,=d- ax, where a is a constant. 
Furthermore, we will assume that the variability of d,is the same for all values 
of x The annual growth of a single individual of the size A+. will be, accord- 
ing to these assumptions, d+ ax-+y, where y expresses the accidental variation 
of ee annual increment. The size of the individual at the pericd ¢, will there- 
‘ore be

  It follows from this equation that as long as , is considerably larger than py, a

years 4 increases with age, among young children the small ones are in a period 
of retarded growth, while the tall ones are in a period of accelerated growth, 
while among older children when « begins to decrease again the tall ones cease 
growing, whilo the smaller ones grow rapidly.

It must also be borne in mind that the formula 
Annual amount of growth =d + ax 
is a very rough approximation to actual conditions, and that, particularly during 
the period preceding puberty, the distribution of annual increase will differ con- 
siderably from this law. 
Dr. H. P. Bowditch, in a paper published in the Twenty-second Annual Report 
of the State Board of Health of Massachusetts, assumes that the growth of chil- 
dren is such that they always remain in the same percentile grade—that is to say, 
if the variability at the period tis , and at the period f, is z,, then the average child 
which has at the period ¢ the measurement A+ «=A -- ra will have at the pe- 
riod ¢, the measurement A, +h Its growth during the intervening period will 
therefore be

The assumption is therefore narrower than the one made above, as a, which we 
tried to determine by means of the various data, is here given the arbitrary value 
ae It will be noticed that for 
m=0 
a will assume the value Boe The data given on pages 1546 and 1547 show that 
m is so large that it can not be neglected, Therefore the assumption a—=/1—/“ 
can not be true, and we conclude that the average percentile grade of growing 
individuals is constantly changing. 
The average individual of the measurement A + «& at the period ¢ will be at the 
period ¢,

If the individual remained on the same percentile grade, his measurement would 
be 
A+td+ he (2) 
It will be seen that the deviation (1) is smaller than (2). It follows, therefore, 
that the average of all growing individuals who in one year have a certain per- 
centile grade will be nearer the general average the following year. This agrees 
with the results found by Dr. Henry G. Beyer.' 
These facts and considerations have an important bearing upon the theory of 
the statistics of growth.? When we consider children of a certain age, we find 
that they are not all in the same stage of development. Some have reached a 
point just corresponding to their age, while others are a little behind, and still 
others a little in advance, of their age. Consequently the values of their measure- 
ments will not exactly correspond to those of their age. We may assume that 
the difference between their stage of development and that belonging to their 
exact age is due to accidental causes, so that the number less developed than the 
average of a particular age will be the same as the number of those more devel- 
oped; or there will be as many children in a stage of development corresponding 
to that of their age plus a certain length of time as in a stage corresponding to 
that of their age minus a certain length of time. 
The number of children who have a certain amount of deviation may be assumed 
to be arranged according to the laws of probability, so that the average of all the 
children will be exactly in the stage of development belonging to their age. 
Observations have shown that growth during childhood is quite regular, and 
that it decreases rapidly during the period of adolescence. At this period, when 
the rate of growth is decreasing, those children whose growth is retarded will be 
more remote from the value belonging to their age than those whose growth is 
accelerated. As the numbers above and below the average are equal, those with 
retarded growth will have a greater influence upon the average than those whose 
growth is accelerated; therefore the average of all values of the measurement of 
all the children of a certain age will be too low when the rate of growth is decreas- 
ing and too high when it is increasing. 
These considerations may be expressed in mathematical form as follows: 
In the adult the relative frequency of the variation a from the average value of 
the measurement s will generally be expressed by the formula 
x 
neal ~ Bug? Est ae dx, (1) 
where /, is the measure of the variability of the series.

The value of the measurement belonging to the average of all those individuals 
who will finally reach the value s is, at any given period, a function of that period, 
and may be called s. The value of the measurement at the period ¢ of all those 
individuals who will finally reach the stature s+ is a function of sand a, and fe may be expressed by - (8:5 @). 
The individuals constituting the adult series will not develop quite regularly, 
but some will be in advance of others. We assume that at any given time these 
variations in period will be distributed according to the law of probabilities. The 
relative frequency of the variation y from the period under consideration, tf, will be

The probability, therefore, of finding an individual who will finally have the 
stature s-+a, standing at the period of development ¢-+ y, and whose measure- 
ment is therefore f (s.4,3 2) is equal to P,+.. Pr+y; or,

The individuals who will finally have the measurement s+, will have at a 
period ¢-+y, the same measurement that other individuals who will finally be

number of combinations of # and y, which will result in the same value s,-+ v. 
This will be the case whenever :

As an approximation, we may assume 
Pp (stv; ©) =s-+v+ ax + ba’, 
The distribution of probabilities about the type will then be asymmetrical. It is 
possible to compute from these data the typical values for each year, and at the 
place quoted above I have given a method of approximation. The latter is, how- 
ever, not sufficient. I have disregarded values of the order ab and _b’ in arriving 
at the results given. This is, however, not sufficient. By including terms of 
higher order it is possible to compute the series more accurately, but the calcula- 
tion is so exceedingly long and entails so much labor that I have given it up, 
particularly as it must be verified by actual observation. It seems more econom- 
ical to wait until a satisfactory series of measurements, taken at annual intervals, 
is available. 
Dr. H. P. Bowditch ! has called attention to the asymmetry of the curves, which 
he expressed by the difference between the probable and average values. His 
observations were corroborated by the study of material collected in St. Louis, 
Mo., by Dr. W. T. Porter,? who followed the method laid down by Dr. Bowditch. 
In order to gain a better insight into the character of the annual curves I have 
combined all the available American material. This computation was carried out 
for me by Dr. G. M. West, according to myinstructions. The computations were 
made under his immediate supervision, and he is responsible for the preliminary 
interpolation, while I made the final combination myself.

The method of procedure was the following. Observations are available from 
the following six cities: Boston, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Worcester, Toronto, Oak- 
land. These represent a variety of conditions. We may assume that the varia- 
tions represented by various cities are due to accidental causes, that is to say, that 
when the children in all the towns and cities of the country are measured we expect 
to find the results to vary around a certain average, according to the laws of prob- 
ability. The type of the total population would embrace statistics of all the indi- 
viduals of various ages. Theseare notavailable, and we must consider the cities in 
which the measurements were taken as representatives of the total population. In 
order to unite the material properly we ought to know how large a portion of the 
population is represented by each city. We can not obtain any satisfactory infor- 
mation on this point, and the only practicable way of uniting the material seems 
to be to add all the measured individuals, without regard to the varying numbers 
that were measured in each city. This has been done. It wasnecessary to reduce 
the observations that were recorded in inches to centimeters. Similar reductions 
were necessary in the tables of weights. This required a lengthy interpolation. 
The St. Louis measurements required an additional interpolation, as the age of 
the measured children was recorded at the nearest birthday, while all the other 
observers counted age from the last birthday. The results of this calculation are 
given on pages 1555 and 1556. 
It will be noticed that the distribution is rather unexpectedly irregular. I pre- 
sume this is due to the fact that observers developed a tendency to round their 
observations, so that full inches and the centimeters ending with 0 or 5 (110, 115, 
120, etc.) were given undue preference. It is likely that if this fact had been con- 
sidered, the resulting curves would have been smoother.

                      From the preceding facts and considerations we conclude that the averages and 
variabilities of growing children must not be considered more than indices of the 
typical conditions characteristic of a certain age. In order to determine these 
accurately, the asymmetry of the distributions must be taken into account. This, 
however, can not be done, except by the expenditure of a vast amount of labor, 
until a sufficient series of observations, taken according to the individualizing 
method, is available.   GROWTH AS DETERMINED BY THE TOTAL SERIES OF TORONTO CHILDREN. 
I give first of all a table of statures grouped in periods of quarter years. In this 
tabulation all those individuals who did not expressly state that their age was so

andso many years and no months were omitted, because there is a considerable prob- 
ability that in many cases of this sort the number of months was not recorded, 
For this reason the number of children corresponding to the full years and no 
months is too small. It might have been better to group the material as follows: 
11, 0, 1 months; 2, 3, 4 months; 5, 6, 7 months; 8, 9, 10 months; but I did not do 
so, in order to preserve the comparability with other series which extend over the 
whole year. The records of ages show that in order to obtain accurate results 
the question ought not to be simply for years and months, but we should ask for the 
age at the last birthday, age at the coming birthday, and the date of the birthday. 
When we simply ask for years and months, the person answering the question will 
often first give the age at the nearest birthday, particularly when the approaching 
birthday is not far distant, and then add the number of months passed since the 
last birthday, thus introducing an error of a whole year. This was noticed to 
occur in the Worcester measurements that were repeated after the lapse of a year, 
Accuracy can be attained only by the three questions given before. 
The following are the tables of statures:

  THE GROWTH OF TORONTO CHILDREN. 1569 
It appears from these tables that on the whole the Toronto children are not as 
favorably developed as are American children, their statures being slightly shorter. 
The variability of the Toronto series does not differ so much from the general 
series as might be expected. The causes that modify the growth of children ina 
single city appear to be so great that the decrease in general variability is very 
slight indeed. 
The variabilities given in the preceding tables are those for the whole year. 
When the variabilities for each year are calculated from the averages of the tri- 
monthly periods given on pages 1558-1564, a considerable reduction in the values 
takes place.

THE GROWTH OF FIRST-BORN CHILDREN. 
I have shown (Science, 1895, April 12) that the first-born children in Oakland, 
Cal., exceed in height later-born children. The data which were then available 
gave the following results. The columns headed ‘ Differences” contain the 
amount to be added to the average statures and weights in order to obtain the 
measurements of first-born and later-born children. The figures in parentheses 
designate the number of individuals measured.

  It appears, therefore, that the result is not quite certain, since the error is great 
as compared to the average difference. Since for later-born children the errors of 
the average are very great, I have not carried out the calculation. For first-born 
girls I obtain the following results:

This result is much more certain than that obtained by means of the measure- 
ments of boys. When we combine both we find that the difference of stature 
between the average of all the children and the average of the first-born chi!dren 
is in favor of the latter. The amount is 3.6 mm., with a mean error of 41.2 mm. 
It is therefore certain that first-born children are somewhat taller than later-born 
children, but the amount of the difference is not definitely known. 
It is of interest to investigate the constitution of families. I have done so by 
Becoraing for each age the number of children, eon to the order of their 
birt!

  From these data we can obtain an insight into the constitution of families in 
Toronto. The difference between the number of first and second born children 
shows the number of mothers having one child only; the difference between the 
second and third born children gives the number of mothers who have two chil-

Per cent of third-born children. 
Per cent of fourth-born children. 
Per cent of fifth and later born children 
    
It appears from this table that families in Toronto are much larger than those 
in Oakland, Cal. There are 26.4 per cent of first-born childrenin Oakland as com- 
pared to 22.6 per cent of first-born children in Toronto, while fifth and later born 
children form only 22 per cent of the total population in Oakland, and in Toronto 
they form 30 per cent. This indicates that the size of the families is considerably 
smaller in Oakland than in Toronto. It is difficult to judge what the social causes 
of this phenomenon may be. The general conditions of life and the nationalities 
composing the population certainly have a great influence upon the size of families. 
In order to investigate this question, I have tabulated the Toronto girls according 
to their order of birth and nationality. The results of this tabulation are given 
in the following table: a

When we group these results so as to equalize the number of cases approxi- 
mately, treating the three first-born children separately, forming the fourth group 
by combining the fourth and fifth born children, and including all the later-born 
children in one group, we find the following results:

Total... 30, 630 
  
That is to say, the percentage of Scotch, Irish, American, German, French, and 
miscellaneous grandparents remains the same for all the children, no matter what 
the order of their birth may be. There is, however, a fundamental difference in 
the distribution of English and Canadian children. Among the first-born chil- 
dren, 39 per cent of the grandparents are of English birth. Among the later-born 
children, 47 per cent are of English birth. This indicates that in families whose 
grandparents are of English birth we find a greater number of children than 
among the other nationalities. The reverse is the case among the Canadians. 
There is among the later-born children a decided decrease in the number of 
grandparents of Canadian birth. This indicates that the families of Canadian 
descent are small. It is very peculiar that these differences are found only among 
the English and Canadians, and that there are no differences in distribution among 
all the other nationalities. 
This table is of importance also as showing that the difference in stature between 
first-born children and later-born children can not be ascribed to the influence of 
differences in nationality. The change of proportion of English and Canadian 
blood in the grand total is so slight that we can not possibly assume that it will 
materially modify the average stature of the people. We may therefore safely 
say that the difference in stature between first-born and later-born children is not 
influenced by complications resulting from the influence of nationality.

  CHAPTER XXXV. 
REPORT ON EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BuREAU OF EDUCATION, ALASKA DIVISION, 
Washington, D. C., June 30, 1897. 
Str: I have the honor to submit the twelfth annual report of the United States 
general agent of education in Alaska for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1897. 
There is in Alaska a school population of from 8,000 to 10,000; of these, 1,895 
were enrolled in the twenty Government schools in operation during the fiscal 
year. 
Circle City.—Miss Anna Fulcomer, teacher; enrollment, 43; population, whites, 
half-breeds, and natives. The development of the gold mines along the tributa- 
ries of the Upper Yukon has within the past two or three years attracted hundreds. 
of miners, some of them with their families, into that region. Feeling the need 
for school facilities, on January 5, 1896, a mass meeting was held at Circle City, 
under the Arctic Circle, in the heart of the Birch Creek mining district, and the 
center of a population of several thousand, at which a petition for a trained pub- 
lic-school teacher was drawn up and subsequently forwarded to the Bureau of 
Education, and a volunteer lady teacher temporarily engaged. In their letter to 
the Bureau, the citizens guaranteed that they would erect a schoolhouse before 
the arrival of a professional teacher in September. To show that they were in 
earnest, over $1,100 was raised for school purposes and all the ladies in town were 
by the citizens constituted a school board. It was felt that such zeal should not 
be checked, and Miss Anna Fulcomer, who had previously done good service in 
the school at Unalaska, on the Aleutian Islands, was selected as teacher for Circle 
City. 
Miss Fulcomer thus describes her experiences: ‘‘I arrived here on August 17, 
1896, finding no school building ready for me, and not a vacant house in town in 
which I could open the school. Consequently, I was obliged to wait, impatiently, 
until October 1, when the building was under roof; then I opened my school, in 
spite of the fact that the windows were not in and the doors were not hung. The 
men worked off and on while I was teaching, but it was not until December 12 
that the work stopped. Since that time the schoolhouse has been as snug and 
comfortable as any place in town. During the winter nearly all the men in town 
left for the new gold diggings at Klondike, where they were more successful than 
they had been here. When the ice ran out of the Yukon the third week in May, 
these men came down the river, packed up their belongings, and moved to Klon- 
dike with their families. This is one reasoh for the sudden decrease in the school 
attendance during May. The other reason is that at last spring sunshine had come. 
‘sFor seven months it had been so cold and stormy that the children could have 
no out-of-doors play life. In May the weather moderated, the sun shone warm and 
bright, the snow began to melt, ducks, geese, and song birds slowly came, and the 
children were fairly wild to be out of doors. It seemed almost as much of a sin 
to keep them in the house as it does to keep our faithful farm animals shut in the 
dim, musty barn and feed them on dry hay, when they deserve to be out frisking 
and enjoying the bright sunshine and eating the tender, fresh grass. Many native 
children dropped out, and I did not blame them. However, I kept on with an 
attendance of eleven and twelve pupils. But it suddenly grew intensely hot; alk 
kinds of bugs and worms began to wake from their winter’s sleep and came crawl- 
ing out of the moss filling the chinks between the logs—bees, hornets, and our 
terrible pest, mosquitoes. Sometimes it was enough to make one’s flesh creep. 
With such visitors as these the children could not study, so before long we had 
to stop school.

  EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 1605 
“Teaching school in this far north land is altogether different from teaching in 
the States, and the teacher is at times compelled to change the usual order of 
things and use her own judgment, depending on the Depariment’s having faith 
enough in her to sanction such changes. For nearly three months during the 
winter the people want to hibernate. They can not help it, for there seems to be 
something in the air tending to that result. The days areso short that the people 
sink into a kind of stupor, not wanting to rouse up when daylight comes, even 
though that be delayed until 11 inthemorning. During these dark months I was 
always at the schoolhouse before half past 9, but was usually alone there until 
half past 10, when the children would straggle sleepily in, some without break- 
fast. By noon all would be there. 
**When the citizens wrote to the Bureau of Education a year ago for a teacher 
there was the greatest enthusiasm on the subject; but months before I arrived all 
the enthusiasm had died out, the women trustees were at sword’s points, nearly 
all the money raised had been paid out for the temporary teacher and firewood, 
and hardly anyone, even those who had children, were in favor of a school at all, 
but wanted the money that remained put into a hallfor town and dance purposes. 
However, the school has been a success. I like the children; the majority are 
bright, intelligent, and lovable.” 
Teller Reindeer Station.—T. L. Brevig, teacher; enrollment of pupils, 53; popu- 
lation, Eskimo. During the fiscal year school has been in session one hundred 
and sixty days. The attendance has been somewhat less than during the previous 
year, owing to the fact that the headquarters of the herd has been at Ageeopak, 
which was too far from the station to permit the regular attendance of the herd- 
ers. The progress made among those who attended regularly has been satisfac- 
tory. Ithas been noticed that the Eskimos who have been to the States one or 
more times are far ahead of the rest of the natives with regard to cleanliness, 
clothing, language, and good behavior. This is the natural result of contact with 
civilization. 
Cape Prince of Wales.—Thomas Hanna, teacher; enrollment of pupils, 132; pop- 
ulation, Eskimo. The school was not so well attended as in previous years. A 
feud between two of the principal families, brought about by drunkenness and 
the killing of two men and the scarcity of food were the chief causes of the 
decreased attendance. School work was so divided that both day and night ses- 
sions were held. The printing press donated by Mrs. W. T. Hatch, of Brooklyn, 
N. Y., has been very useful in enabling the teacher to prepare supplementary les- 
sons for the school. Some of the boys have assisted in setting type and in dis- 
tributing it. A kindergarten was established in May, conducted by Mrs. Lopp. 
St. Lawrence Island.—V.C. Gambell, teacher; enrollment of pupils, 66; popu- 
lation, Eskimo. The people, young and old, have shown untiring interest in the 
school. On stormy days the parents carry the smaller children to school. We let 
all the children come, no difference how young they are, but they are not enrolled 
if under 5; these learn English and songs from hearing the older ones. The girls 
attend regularly now, though they are yetvery bashful. The winds were unusu- 
ally favorable the past winter, allowing them to catch an abundance of seals; so 
that at no time was there suffering from lack of food. 
They have at last learned to manufacture whisky. A whaler brought a woman 
from Point Hope who taught them. They use about 5 quarts of molasses and 3 of 
flour to a 5-gallon coal oil can of water. This is allowed to ferment for from four 
to seven days, when it is heated, the vapor passing through an old gun barrel 
which is kept cool, thus condensing it. This yields about a quart of whisky. 
Several houses were making it all winter, and drunken men were not uncommon. 
The children are cleaner, and show a decided improvement in every way. We 
try to have all the people clean themselves up when the Bear comes, and a great 
many of them do in their way. We think we have gained their confidence, and 
look forward for greater improvements in the not distant future. 
Unalaska.—Miss M. E. Mellor, teacher, and Miss M. Salamatoff, assistant; 
enrollment, 48; population, Aleut. Miss Mellor reports as follows: ‘‘ The school 
opened September 1, 1896, with an enrollment of 39 children; 48 were on the roll 
at the close of school. This represents the number of regular attendants only. 
At intervals during the year we had an attendance of 56 for a week at a time— 
almost all the children in the village. When the Russian school closed for the 
holidays many of the boys came to our school regularly during that time. They 
seemed to prefer the ‘ American ’ school, as they called it, and when they came to 
ask permission to attend, if only for a short season, we had not the heart to refuse 
them, although we were overcrowded without them. For over a month we had 
two children from the distant island of Sannakh. Their mother brought them to 
me, and, through an interpreter, asked if I would take them into our school. The

childrén, as a whole, have worked weil at their studies, and their progress has been 
encouraging. In arithmetic the highest class has commenced work in fractions, 
and almost half of the pupils can do examples in multiplication and long division 
with a very fair degree of accuracy and rapidity. Much attention has been given 
to phonic drill and to the construction of English sentences. We have exercises 
in composition three times a week, some familiar object being taken; and after 
reading or talking about it the children would write on their slates what they 
could remember about it. These written exercises were read aloud in class and 
criticised, both as to subject-matter and the use of English. We have no text- 
books on United States history, but I read to the older pupils from a ‘Young 
Folks’ history and then talked about it. Marked progress has been made in read- 
ing; each class has had two lessons a day. It is gratifying to note an increasing 
love for the study. Elementary drawing, physiology, and geography have also 
had their proper place in school work, with gratifying results. The work of the 
year has been very pleasant and the outlook is most encouraging.” 
Unga.—O. R. McKinney, teacher; enrollment, 40; population, white and Aleut. 
Mr. McKinney submits the following report: ‘‘ During the summer, authority was 
granted by the Commissioner of Education for the building of an ex ion to the 
schoolhouse, to be used as a library room. Owing to the fact that we could not 
secure the services of a carpenter, I commenced school on August 24, in order to 
get in as much time as possible before the carpenter was ready. I continued 
school until the last of September. I then closed school and set to work with the 
carpenter at the building, so that it might be finished as soon as possible. About 
the last of October we had the work far enough along to enable us to have school 
again. During the holidays the carpenter completed the work, and from January 
10 our school continued until May 30 without interruption. My pupils are making 
rapid progress in their studies, and we seem to have the full sympathy and sup- 
port of all the patrons. On March 12 we had an exhibition, which was considered 
a grand success. The school is in better condition than ever before, the moral 
tone of our village has been much better during the year than ever, and there is 
nothing to discourage me inmy work. Our library is stillincreasing, and is doing 
a great deal of good among the readers. Books will be thankfully received. We 
are much in need of an organ or some musical instrument in our school.” 
Kadiak.—C. C. Solter, teacher; enrollment, 52; population, Russian Creoles. 
Mr. Solter writes: ‘‘ My larger pupils did excellent work in language and drawing. 
I am sometimes surprised to get such well-written sentences, when I consider that 
outside of the schoolroom scarcely a word of English is spoken. In drawing they 
excel, and make better progress than the average American children. In arith- 
metic they are not so apt, yet I have third-reader pupils who handle fractions 
very readily. They take much interest also in geography and history. If anyone 
doubts whether it pays for these children to attend school, the parents of the 
children certainly do not. They want their children to learn, and are proud to 
receive a letter from an absent son or daughter. 
“Many children wholive in settlements where there is no school would be sent 
here if we could board them. I have been asked several times by white men to 
take in their boy or girl, that he or she could have the benefit of an education. 
So far it has been impossible for us to accommodate anyone, though the parents 
were willing to pay board for their children. There is no place here where a 
child could be properly cared for; all the people have enough to do to take care 
of their own children. Our house istoosmall. If we did take them we would 
soon be overcrowded in our schoolroom, which is barely large enough to accom- 
modate the Kadiak children, There is no doubt that if a boarding school were 
started the children would flock in from all parts of this district. This would be 
the most satisfactory kind of a school. There would be regularity in attendance. 
Being in school constantly, they would soon learn to use the English language 
fluently, to the exclusion of the Russian and Aleut. They would thus exercise 
an influence for good over the other children and become thoroughly American- 
ized. Several families now live in Kadiak in order that their children may have 
the advantage of the school. The fathers are at work at distant stations. Many 
more would do the same thing if they could afford it. Every year I furnish a 
number of books to parents living at a distance, who begin the education of their 
children at home. I hope that Congress will increase our appropriations until in 
the near future every child in Alaska may have a chance for a common-school 
education. I can not close my report without urging again the necessity of com- 
pulsory attendance. The Russian schools are able to compel attendance by the 
authority of the church, but American teachers can only urge the advantages to 
be secured with indifferent success. Some resident of the village should be 
appointed with full authority to enforce the attendance of all recalcitrant young-

sters. The children were very much pleased with the garden seeds that were 
kindly sent me by the Bureau for distribution among their parents. At first I 
gave a package of seeds to one child in each family, thinking that would be suffi- 
cient, but the rest thought themselves slighted and wept so piteously that 1 had 
to give each child a package. They evidently made good use of them, as small 
gardens can be seen scattered all over town. Many of them had never planted 
seeds before.” 
Karluk.—R. B. Dunmire, teacher; enrollment, 28; population, whites and 
Aleuts. The school year has shown decided progress in the various branches of 
school work. The people are learning to discriminate between Americans and the 
fishermen and sailors who come to this great canning station during the summer 
months. Of course, the opposition of the Russian Church is as decided as ever. 
The children have been better clad than they were last winter, still some of them 
come to school in their bare feet even on cold days. The population is decreasing 
rapidly, owing largely to the poverty of the natives, coupled with their drunken- 
ness andimmorality. The fishermen are the chief cause of these two vices. Of the 
children born during the last two years, but one remains alive. The United States 
commissioner at Unalaska, 700 miles away, is the nearest representative of the 
authority of the United States. Here there is no means whatever of punishing 
the perpetrators of crime. Still there is hope for the children in that they are 
rapidly learning the English language and are beginning to learn how to take care 
eA themselves. It is yet possible to repair some of the wrong that has been done 
them. 
Haines.—W. W. Warne, teacher; enrollment, 68; population, Thlinget. Mr. 
Warne writes: ‘‘ This report closes the sixth year of my services as teacher of this 
school. The year has been our best. More real advancement has been made 
than in any previous year; the attendance has not been much larger, but it has 
been more regular and we have not had so many raw recruits. Most of the chil- 
dren around here have been to school more or less, so that instead of it being the 
exception to find a child that has attended school it is now the exception to find 
one who has not attended, at least for a short time. If we continue work a few 
years longer, we shall have reached almost all the children, and our work will be 
firmly established. In my experience with the parents I can not help but notice 
that they begin to regard it as a disgrace for a child to remain illiterate, and all 
show more or less eagerness to have their children attend school. The change in 
this respect during the past six years is very noticeable. I see a bright future for 
our work, although I can not deny that there is a dark side, but the progress cer- 
tainly has been encouraging, and I hope that the good work may be pushed even 
more rapidly in the future than it has been in the past.” 
Sitka, No 1.—Mrs. G. Knapp, teacher; enrollment, 39; population, white, Amer- 
ican, and Russian. The regularity of attendance at this school has been very sat- 
isfactory, largely owing to the fact that the teacher offered prizes for punctuality. 
Because of the many changes among the naval and civil officials stationed at 
Sitka there are changes in the school. Children from the States come and go 
with their parents, and it is possible to compare the work of the school with the 
work done in cities in the East. Mrs. Knapp states that children from the States 
enter classes with Sitka children of their own age. A circulating library is main- 
tained in connection with the school, and has proved a source of much enjoyment 
to the children. 
Sitka, No. 2.—Miss Cassia Patton, teacher, and Miss Flora Campbell, assistant; 
enrollment, 154; population, Thlinget. The following is Miss Patton’s report: 
“There being two teachers, we were able to give more individual instruction, 
which is especially helpful to these non-English speaking children. Our girls and 
small boys enjoyed knitting very much. In sewing, we found some of the girls 
quite apt in the use of the needle, and the boys were pleased to learn how to sew 
on buttons, especially when they were allowed to replace any lost from their gar- 
ments. Much of our work is developing their knowledge of English, which is not 
spoken in their homes. I havea small collection of objects by which they are sur- 
rounded at home, of which they soon learn the English names. About the ist of 
November the Russian parochial school opened and took from us some of the chil- 
dren who were faithful followers of the Russo-Greek Church, but many continued 
to go to both schools irregularly in order to be sure of two Christmas trees. One 
day the janitor of the Russian school came into our school and asked for all the 
‘Russian Indians,’ as followers of the Greek Church are called. I replied (Miss 
Campbell interpreting) that I did not distinguish between Russian Indians or any 
other kind, and that this was a Government public school, where all were on the 
same footing. He began picking them out; then I told him that they were all 
Americans and could come here if they pleased. Taking the flag, which we are in

the habit of saluting, I spoke to the children and told them that if their parents 
wished them to come to this school no one else had anything to say about it. I 
was only sorry that 1*could not say to the parents that according to the laws of 
the United States they must send their children to learn English, or American, as 
they term it. In January there was great feasting and dancing in the native 
village in honor of the visit of a hundred visitors from Hoonah, which interfered 
considerably with our attendance. Then came an epidemic of whooping cough 
and the usual spring exodus for fish eggs. Immediately after Christmas f offered 
prizes to be given on Washington’s Birthday to those whose attendance was good 
until that time; seven were worthy of dolls or mouth organs, and one, whose rec- 
ord was excellent, I deemed worthy of a suit of clothes, and a very happy boy he 
was, for I believe it was his first whole new suit. My next effort to increase the 
attendance and punctuality was to buy a number of toys which I allowed the chil- 
dren to play with before each session, 
«For the last three years I have distributed garden seeds during the last months 
of school, thus keeping the children in attendance and interesting the parents. 
Through the kindness of Dr. Jackson and the Agricultural Department, I was 
able to distribute a greater quantity this year. In this work I have been very 
much assisted by my father, who is a practical farmer, and has allowed me to 
bring my classes to his garden, where he showed them how to plant and weed. 
The great drawback to their gardening is that they have had the habit of planting 
on distant islands, only visiting them from time totime. A beginning has now 
been made in making gardens in the Sitka village. If they continue to do this, I 
believe it will tend to make them build their houses farther apart, which will be 
an improvement from a sanitary point of view and perhaps tend to break up the 
custom of several families living in the same house. Ihave yetafurtherinterestin 
this gardening. My father is experimenting in the raising of flax, which, I believe, 
is just the thing for this country. I have had a wooden loom built, which the 
natives, who are apt with tools, can copy, and I propose to teach the women to 
weave rag carpet. These carpets will make their homes more attractive; and if 
the flax is a success, the industries of gardening and weaving will be open to them. 
Of course this will be slow work, but as the fishing and hunting diminish we need 
to have industries in which they are interested ready for them.” 
Juneau, No, 1.—S. A. Keller, teacher; enrollment, 86; population, white. 
Juneau is the largest town in southeast Alaska, and the school is working on a 
course that will soon reach the high-school grade. However, with only one 
teacher it is difficult to plan the work so as to give each pupil the training neces- 
sary for individual intellectual growth. About 20 per cent of the children of 
school age are on the streets. A law for compulsory regular attendance at school 
would be a great benefit. 
Juneau, No, 2.—Miss Elizabeth Saxman, teacher; enrollment, 26; population, 
Thlinget. Miss Saxman writes: ‘‘ The spirit of emulation that prevailed among 
the children during the entire term was indeed encouraging. The boys and girls 
seemed more wide-awake and enthusiastic than ever before. More than a little 
rivalry was manifested. The lack of this used to annoy me considerably, as some 
of the largest pupils did not seem to care whether they made any progress or not. 
In many cases it is difficult to get the native parents to send their children to 
school. They give you faithful promises when you go to see them, and say that 
they will send their children ‘to-morrow’ or ‘next week ’—in fact, say anything 
to settle the question for the present. However, I feel that we shall surely reach 
them satisfactorily this winter, since Mr. Fred Moore (a native graduate of the 
Sitka school) has been appointed chief of the native police. He is doing a grand 
work among his people.” 
Jackson.—Miss C. Baker, teacher; enrollment, 84; population, Thlinget. Miss 
Baker reports as follows: ‘‘At the commencement of the term but few of the 
natives had returned from their summer hunting. After the village had filled up 
I went around and talked with each family of the importance of sending the chil- 
dren to school regularly. Asa result, every child in town that was large enough 
came to school. Iused every effort to increase their interest and keep them in 
school, and succeeded beyond my expectations, the irregularity in the cases in 
which it occurred being the fault of the parents and not of the children. We 
have kept the schoolroom well filled, well cleaned, and well ventilated throughout 
the term. The interest and progress have been commendable, arithmetic and 
writing being the favorite studies. The discouraging feature of the work is the 
continual coming and going of the natives from village to village, which greatly 
interferes with regularity of attendance. However, I think we have had an 
excellent school.” 
Fort Wrangel.—Miss Anna R. Kelsey, teacher; enrollment, 64; population,
-P-A-G-E-481
EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 1609 
Thlinget. This is the oldest of the schools in Alaska, having been established in 
1877. From that time until the present it has continued to be a means for the 
uplifting of the natives in this region. Here the native chief, Shakes, has been 
of considerable assistance in securing the attendance of the children. 
Saxman.—J. W. Young, teacher; Miss M. J. Young, assistant teacher; enroll- 
ment, 75; population, Thlinget. Mz, Young gives the following account of the 
year: ‘‘The year has made a great change in the size of the community, and if 
that is to be a test, we have succeeded very well.. When I arrived here in the fall 
of 1895 to build up a temperance, self-governing community there was no building 
here except the schoolhouse. Now we have a village of 24 houses, with a popu- 
lation of 120. As you know, the Thlingets do not remain in one place during the 
entire year, but go to their hunting and fishing grounds at the proper season. 
During the months of December, January, and February we had quite a good 
school, and the pupils made good progress in their studies, especially the younger 
ones. Some of them did not know a single letter when they came in the fall and 
now they are in the Second Reader. We find it difficult to get the older ones to 
attend with any degree of regularity, consequently their progress is slow. 
“We have had some encouragements in our work. The natives have been very 
kind and even generous to us, doing what they could to make it pleasant for us. 
But we have had some discouragements as well. Although we have succeeded in 
keeping intoxicating liquor out of the village, yet the effects of its use elsewhere 
have reached us. In February the natives became intoxicated at Ketchikan, and 
in a drunken fight a Cape Fox native struck a Tongas native on the head with a 
rifle, from the effects of which he died. The Tongas tribe demanded pay for the 
life of their tribesman and the Cape Fox people gave them 200 blankets. Then 
the Tongas men demanded the life of a Cape Fox chief, as the murdered man had 
been a chief. The Cape Fox tribe refused, and their warriors armed themselves 
to resist the threatened attack of the Tongas men. Someof the latter came down 
from Ketchikan in their war paint, with rifles and knives, bent on killing. The 
women and children crowded into the schoolhouse, in terror. However, when the 
attacking party found that our people were ready for them and determined to 
make a stout resistance, they returned without firing a shot. This trouble is very 
unfortunate for Saxman, as it has made hard feeling between the two tribes that 
we were gathering together, and I fear will keep a number of the Tongas people 
from coming to Saxman. 
“T found that there was great need for a store in our new settlements so I put 
up asuitable building and sent for my son, who laid in a stock of goods and is 
conducting a successful business. It is a great help to the community.”

    PRESBYTERIAN MISSIONS. 
The Sitka Industrial School.—This largest of all the industrial schools in Alaska 
was established in 1880 by the Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church, 
The buildings are admirably located on an elevation about 200 feet from high- 
water mark about midway between the town of Sitka and Indian River. An 
abundant supply of pure water is brought in pipes a distance of three-fourths of 
amile. The water is forced to a height of 80 feet into a large tank by means of a 
force pump, and from this source all the, buildings, including the hospital, are 
supplied. In connection with the school are eight ‘‘ model cottages” where the 
married couples from the school begin housekeeping in ‘* Boston style,” as the 
natives express it. Funds for the erection of some of the cottages were loaned 
(without interest) by the Indian Rights Association; others were erected with 
money furnished by benevolent individuals in sympathy with this rational method. 
of dealing with the Indian problem. The young people who occupy these cottages 
have a life lease of the ground, and are expected to pay for the cottages in install- 
ments. The average cost of a cottage is $350. We expect these model homes to 
be centers of purity, from which will radiate influences that will be far-reaching 
and lasting in their results. Here family life is established and family ties are 
held sacred; hereindustry, frugality, perseverance, and thrift are developed: here 
old heathen customs have no place—no Indian doctors, no witchcraft, no plural 
wives, no drinking, no gambling, no reckless living. In these homes the young 
husbands have a chance to develop into manly, self-respecting men and the young 
wives into tidy, industrious women. 
Hospital.—in 1889 it became evident that a place was needed for the care of the 
sick, and Mrs. Elliott F. Shepard, of New York, very liberally donated the money for 
the erection of a hospital for the girls. Later a boys’ hospital was erected near by. 
In 1892 it became evident that it was unwise to attempt to carry on two separate 
establishments, and the boys’ hospital was somewhat enlarged and the upper floor 
devoted to a ward for girls. This combined hospital was opened for patients 
November 22, 1894. Previous to 1894 the building had been opened only to patients 
from the school, but now the wards were opened to natives from any part of

Alaska. The following isasummary of the work during 1897: Number of patients 
treated, 206; aggregate number of days in hospital, 2,594; average number of days,

number of operations performed, in-patient, 38; total number of prescriptions 
made since Jtine, 1894, 10,581. 
Language.—The children speedily acquire an English-speaking vocabulary when 
strictly prohibited from using their native dialects. For five years English has 
been the exclusive language of the school. Experience has removed all doubt as to 
its expediency. The use of their vernaculars (Thlinget, Tsimpshean, Hydia) seri- 
ously retards their progress and does them no essential benefit. No schoolbooks 
have ever been printed in any of their native dialects. Hach distinct people hasa 
dialect of its own, local in character, and in course of time the vernacular dialects 
of the tribes of southeastern Alaska will become obsolete and English will every- 
where prevail. Asamatter of preservation the Society of Alaskan Natural History 
and Ethnology has lately commenced to reduce the Thlinget language to writing, 
pee we hope to accomplish through the instrumentality of Mrs, Paul and Miss 
illard. 
Culinary department.—This department is a place of great interest to the pupils, 
both boys and girls, small and large. All want to come into the kitchen to work 
and to learn to cook. The boys wish to know how to cook good meals and bake 
good bread, pies, and cakes. ‘They often ask if they can come into the kitchen to 
work, and this stirs up a spirit of emulation among the girls so that they beg to 
work in the kitchen; consequently, there is no lack of those who desire to work in 
these departments. 
In the bakery the work is too heavy for the girls, and is done entirely by the boys. 
During the past year they have averaged 140 pounds of flour baked daily, turning 
out from 90 to 100 loaves of delicious bread a day. When the girls serve in the 
kitchen, they bake the pies and cakes and the boys in their turn do the same, which 
is during the winter season, that being the hard period of work. Much attention 
has been given to the quality of food, and in the past few years it has been greatly 
improved. One great victory won in the battle of work in these departments is 
cleanliness. In this direction there has been a vast improvement made. It isa 
pleasure now to be with them and hear them say: ‘Oh, this must be very clean; I 
want it to be clean and nice.” Viewing these departments, they have made rapid 
progress in the last year. 
The kitchen is supplied with both hot and cold water. The greatest obstacle in 
the work of these departments is the annoyance of having green wood much of the 
time. 
The sewing room has been enlarged and nicely papered. The light is admitted 
from the east, so that they get the benefit of the morning sun. This department 
is well equipped, and the amount of work done each weekissurprising. ‘The girls 
over 7 years of age knit their own stockings. Inthe sewing department they learn 
quickly and accomplish much. Sewing machines are in daily use, and the girls 
soon learn to use them. Almost every graduate has a machine of her own. 
All the shoes are made by the boys, apprenticed under the direction of a master 
workman. Considerable custom work is also done. 
Gardening.—Mr. John Gamble, gardener.and general worker, has three medium- 
sized plats of arable land. One garden, which has been cultivated for several 
years, produces lettuce, beets, peas, and onions in abundance. Of the other gar- 
dens, which are new, one is planted in potatoes and the other sown in turnips. 
Cereals, for lack of warmth and sunshine, do not ripen. Currants, rhubarb, rasp- 
berries, cauliflower, and celery are easily grown. Fruits, such as apples, plums, 
and pears, have not been fully tested, but it is believed that they could be grown 
with success. 
Blacksmithing can hardly be classed among the trades by which a man canearn 
a living in Alaska, yet there is much work in this line, doing repairs about the 
mission, mending machinery, repairing stoves, making stovepipes and camp hooks, 
sharpening tools, and doing miscellaneous jobs for the citizens of the quaint little 
capital. Soldering and a little tin work are also done. The constant wear and 
tear in most of the work departments require much repairing, nearly all of which 
is done by the boys. 
Painting.—Two or three of the boys have received instruction in this useful 
branch of industry, and are kept busy painting, papering, glazing, and calci- 
mining. i 
Recreations and amusements.—The home life of the school is particularly pleas- 
ant. Their games and plays are such as white children enjoy, consisting of games
-P-A-G-E-491
  EDUCATION IN ALASKA, 1619 
of marbles, baseball, townball, playing soldier, flying kites, sailing ships, target 
practice with bow and arrow, authors, checkers, dominoes, rope jumping, hide- 
and-seek. Coasting and skating are indulged in by both sexes. Then there is an 
organ for the girls and another for the boys, and violins, guitars, fifes, bugles, and 
eho ee ple mouth organs are among the amusements and recreations of 
each day. 
A rational system of discipline is easily and well maintained. 
Those in charge aim to make the industrial training school just what its name 
implies. Manual occupations are in reach of the pupils as fast as they acquire 
sufficient knowledge of the English language to enable them to prosecute the learn- 
ing of a trade with success. To accomplish anything permanent and of material 
benefit in the way of mastering trades they must first acquire a fair, common- 
school education, before which they are not prepared to serve an intelligent 
apprenticeship. After certain initiatory advancement has been made, industrial 
training is then made coequal with schoolroom work. While the boys are taught 
trades, the girls are taught all branches of household industry. Indeed, the 
appointments and work of the school are such as to familiarize them with Ameri- 
can ways of living and to ingraft into their lives industrious habits, 
The steam laundry, with its labor-saving machinery, relieves the teachers and 
pupils of much hard drudging work incident to a school of this character, where 
water and soap must be used in such copious quantities. 
Carpentry department.—All of the buildings on the mission premises, twenty or 
more, have been built by boys apprenticed to this trade, under the supervision of a 
competent foreman. Shopwork consists in the making of furniture, bookcases, 
clothespresses, screens, chests, curtain poles, picture frames, hand sleds, bric-a-brac 
work, and undertaking. The outdoor work consists of joining, framing. contract- 
ing, and building. Sailmaking and boat building are among the useful industries 
of this department. Among our carpenter apprentices a number have shown spe- 
cial aptitude as artists and designers. The spirit of earnest industry is most praise- 
worthy, and the boys appreciate their opportunities. 
In the winter of 1887-88 the Society of Alaskan Natural History and Ethnology 
was organized and incorporated. The purpose is to collect and preserve in connec- 
tion with the Sitka Industrial and Training School specimens of the natural history 
and ethnology of Alaska. 
In addition to the Sitka Industrial School, the Presbyterian Board of Home Mis- 
sions maintains stations at Point Barrow, St. Lawrence Island, Haines, Hoonah, 
Juneau, Fort Wrangell, and Jackson. 
MORAVIAN MISSIONS, 
We are indebted to the Rev. J. Taylor Hamilton, secretary of the Moravian 
Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, for the following sketch of the progress 
of Moravian mission work in Alaska: 
Moravian missionary and educational work in Alaska began in 1884, at the sug- 
gestion of Dr. Sheldon Jackson. After a preliminary tour of exploration, the 
then practically unknown region of the Kuskoquim and Nushagak rivers was 
selected. To establish the work two ordained missionaries, the Revs. William 
Weinland and John Kilbuck, were sent out with their wives, together with a lay 
assistant, Mr. Hans Torgersen, who was to superintend the erection of the needful 
houses. Mr. Kilbuck is a full-blooded Indian, the descendant of a long line of 
distinguished Delaware Christians, and, like his colleague, was a graduate of the 
Moravian College and Theological Seminary at Bethlehem. Before one house had 
been erected Mr. Torgersen was accidentally drowned in the Kuskoquim River. 
Before any converts had been won Mr. Weinland and his family had to withdraw, 
owing to seriously impaired health, later to labor in California. For a while 
Kilbuck and his wife held out alone, contending with the severities of a climate 
which in winter sometimes reached 60° of cold below zero, and with the difficul- 
ties of the Eskimo language. But God blessed their zeal and fidelity. The first 
sign of any reward for their labor was given on Good Friday, 1887. In the best 
Eskimo at their command the missionaries had been striving to acquaint the peo- 
ple with the love of God, and now he was telling that the blood of Jesus Christ 
cleanseth from all sin, when.an old Eskimo interrupted him: ‘‘ Thanks. We, too, 
want our badness washed away.” : 
From the inception of the mission attention has been paid to education, and at 
the three main stations—Bethel and Ougavig, on the Kuskoquim, and Carmel, on 
the Nushagak—industrial schools have been steadily maintained, except when for 
brief intervals lack of provisions, after a season of failure in the catch of salmon, 
has compelled a temporary intermission. The schools at Bethel and at Carmel aro

boarding schools; that at Ougaviga day school. The two former during certain 
years in the past have been Government contract schools. Two boys were for_a 
period entered at the Government school at Carlisle, Pa., and are now serving as 
assistant missionaries. The pupils at Bethel average about 30, at Carmel 35, and 
at Ougavig 15. 
At present 15 missionaries are in this field. On the staff are a graduate of the 
Hahnemann Medical College, Philadelphia—Dr. Herman Romig—and two profes- 
sional nurses, Four hundred and seventy patients were cared for at Bethel during 
the last year, for which a report has been received. Three principal stations are 
occupied and seven outposts. Twenty-seven native assistants cooperate in the 
care of 625 converts, young and old. On January 30, 1897, the first fruits of home 
mission work among the Eskimos themselves were gathered in the baptism of a 
convert at a village 80 miles from Bethel, up to that time served by two native 
assistant missionaries. For several years the mission at Bethel has had a steam 
sawmill in operation, the natives bringing logs and receiving pianks in exchange. 
It is hoped that thus decent houses will gradually supplant the underground 
hovels of a former time. 
When the missionaries came they found the Eskimos filthy, degraded, cruel, the 
prey of the medicine men or shamans, given over to superstition, seeing evil spirits 
in everything, without knowledge of God and without hope for the future. Inthe 
reeking atmosphere of their underground kashimas, 16 to 24 feet square, three or 
four families, two to three dozen persons, might cower over the fatlamps. Privacy 
and decency were unknown. The standard of morality was utterly low. The 
aged and the sick were taken out and exposed to death by cold or starvation, lest 
a kashima should become haunted by death occurring within. The persons of 
the people swarmed with vermin. Now the decencies of family life and the pro- 
prieties of civilization are beginning to be prized. Heathen rites have practically 
ceased through a considerable stretch of country. 
That the Eskimo will ever become civilized in a mode patterned after that of the 
European or American is scarcely to be expected. Climatic conditionsand environ- 
ment are against this. But it is hoped he will imitate the culture and civilization 
of theLaplanders. The Moravian mission is, therefore, deeply interested in the suc- 
cess of the effort to distribute the domesticated reindeer throughout Alaska, the 
benevolent project with which Dr. Sheldon Jackson is so closely identified. This 
is desired, both as a civilizing medium and as likely to afford a more assured 
means of subsistence than the precarious products of the chase and the uncertain 
returns of toil on the waters. But it is also earnestly desired as likely to afford a 
more regular and frequent means of communication and transportation. At pres- 
ent an exchange of letters between the mission and its schools on the one Band 
and the church at home on the other can be counted upon with certainty only once 
a year. 
  CONGREGATIONAL MISSIONS, 
The Rey. C, J. Ryder, corresponding secretary of the American Missionary 
Association of the Congregational Church, has prepared the following statement 
with regard to the work of the society at Cape Prince of Wales: 
"This station is under the care of the American Missionary Association, the 
society of the Congregational churches. Work at this station was begun in 1890, 
Geographically.—Cape Prince of Wales is situated on the most western point of 
mainland in the United States, only a few miles from the Arctic Circle. The 
country is broken and mountainous running back from the shore of Bering Strait. 
Much driftwood is available here and is utilized by the missionaries in the erec- 
tion of their cottages. The station holds a good position strategically for reach- 
ing the Eskimo in the interior of Alaska. The Eskimo residents at Cape Prince 
of Wales are especially active and energetic for people of this race. They are 
counted among the great smugglers of the North. In former reports in this 
Bureau reference has been made to this fact. From Cape Prince of Wales the 
natives cross the straits and carry on trade in ‘‘ deer skins and sinew and wooden 
ware of Alaska,” which they exchange for walrus, ivory, skins of tame reindeer, 
and whale blubber of Siberia.” They also secure in this way ‘“ firearms and 
whisky,” neither of which prove very important factors in their Christian 
civilization, x 
Missionary force.—Messrs. W. T. Lopp and H. R. Thornton were the first mis- 
sionaries in this field. They opened the work at Cape Prince of Wales in 1890. 
Two frame buildings were erected. One of these was occupied as their home and 
the other was used for school and chapel purposes. These buildings are still’stand- 
ing. Mr. Thornton was murdered August 19, 1893. His murder was commitied 
by some native desperadoes who were soon after punished by the Eskimos them-

selves. His death did not indicate any opposition on the part of the natives gen- 
erally to the work. Mr. Lopp and his wife have continued work in the field until 
the present, and are still there. Mr. Lopp has proved very efficient in his admin- 
istration. He has been commissioned by the United States Government to con- 
duct important investigation along the coast to the north of Bering Strait. He 
has also had charge of the reindeer herd assigned by the Government to this sta- 
tion, and has been commissioned to go to the north upon an expedition to relieve 
the whalers that are locked in the ice. 
Present condition of the station.—From the last reports received by the Ameri- 
can Missionary Association we gather the following facts concerning the present 
condition of the work at Cape Prince of Wales. Mr. Lopp had been absent in the 
States for some months and was most cordially received by the natives upon his 
return. He entered immediately upon preparation for the winter. Driftwood 
for fuel and building purposes was rafted down the coast, which was a consider- 
Bole undertaking. Mr. Lopp reports to the American Missionary Association as 
‘ollows: 
A log house 22 by 24 was finished and divided into kitchen, two bedrooms, a 
storeroom, and hall. During the winter the house is buried in snowdrifts to the 
roof, making our side windows almost useless. Two sides and roof were sodded, 
a sod lean-to 20 by 12 was built onto the front in October, which is used as a vesti- 
bule, woodhouse, and carpenter shop. This temporary inclosure, or entrance as we 
call it, was lighted by sky-windows, made of clear blocks of ice. This house has 
proved decidedly the most comfortable and convenient house we have ever used in 
the Arctics. A house for herders was built near ours. It is the same style as ours 
and has been used as a home for them when in from the camp. It is hoped that 
these two buildings will prove object lessons which will not be lost to this settle- 
ment. A house which they can use both winter and summer, a compromise 
pelwreen their underground and the civilized house, is undoubtedly what they 
need. 
“*Mr. Thornton’s monument, which was purchased in San Francisco with funds 
contributed by Southport, Conn., friends, gave these natives a much needed object 
lesson in respecting the dead. ~ Before taking the monument up to the grave, we 
exhibited it at a Sunday service in the Storrs Chapel, explaining to the people its 
object. We also told them about visiting Mrs. Thornton and her little son and 
the kind words of greeting which she sent to them and the prayerful interest which 
she had in them all. 
“To think of Mr. Thornton lying in an Arctic grave recalled to us that he often 
expressed a sentiment so similar to that of the African missionary who is said to 
have compared pioneer mission work to building the foundation for a great bridge, 
and, God willing, was content to lie in an African grave as one of the unseen 
foundation stones. 
“A big Christmas box sent by Dr. Storrs’s missionary boys (may their tribe 
increase), containing knit caps, nuts, pocketknives, beads, dolls, etc.,a box of ship 
biscuit contributed by Mrs. Thornton, and dates and raisins from our own supplies 
on Christmas made it a memorable day—Christmas, 1896. 
“Since 1894 no prizes have been given for attendance at school. One serious 
objection to the prize (biscuit) system was that it educated them to think we were 
under obligation to them for attending school. 
“ The religious work.—Two sermons have been preached almost every Sunday. 
The Sunday school had an average attendance of more than 100 during the winter 
months. Having but four teachers, the classes were often large. We hope some 
of the advanced pupils will soon be able to take classes. It was very gratifying 
and sometimes amusing to see the interest taken in the collection boxes every 
Sunday. Lead, powder, caps, cartridges, spoons, matches, muskrat, ermine, and 
squirrel skins were contributed. We expect to use this collection to build a small 
mission house in the neighboring settlement where driftwood is plentiful. 
“* Reindeer herd.—The mission herd of reindeer has passed successfully through 
the three winters and now numbers about 360. It has been free from diseases 
which have afflicted seriously the Government herd at Port Clarence. To milk a 
cow they lasso her and throw her to the ground. The milk has no unfavorable or 
distasteful flavor and is highly prized by us who have had to depend upon the ‘ tin 
cow’so many years. The herders live in deerskin tents. Our herders consist of 
six Eskimos. With but $54 worth of goods and supplies, it required close manag- 
ing to feed and clothe nine people one year. These six herders should have been 
permitted to devote their entire time to herding, driving, and breaking, but the 
limited amount of supplies compelled us to use one or two in turns at the Cape to 
hunt and work. With our nets and rifles we got some white whale, seals, and 
fish, and in June walruses, which kept them fairly supplied. Each of them now

owns between 35 and 45 deer and we hope in ayear or two, when they can live 
independent of mission support, that the influence which they will exert as Chris- 
tian deermen will do much toward leading the natives along this coast ‘out! 
darkness into light.’ What a pleasure when visiting in camp to see them bow 
their heads and offer thanks to God before eating; to lead them in a little prayer 
meeting where every one joins and to sing with them ‘A tent or a cottage, why 
| should I care?’ Go-ten-um, who is about 21, is considered the best deerman. He 
. is of a mechanical turn of mind and made the wood cuts for the Eskimo Bulletin. 
A trip on reindeer sleds with Kiv-yearz-ruk through the mountains to Port Clar- 
ence was made in January. While there we had an opportunity to visit the Goy- 
ernment herd, talk with the Laplanders, and assist in two services on Sunday, 
which were well attended. Our people have not prospered as in previous winters. 
A threatened epidemic in the fall together with the ‘ hoodoos’ which followed, 
partly accounted for this. Distilling and drunkenness throughout the year often 
prevented many from making the most of a favorable wind. The walrus season 
has not been favorable, but at this writing they have al! well filled meat houses. 
We rejoice that the reindeer herd will give a livelihood to the people for the next 
few years, and thisinfluence may be far-reaching. In conclusion, we wish to thank 
our many friends for their kind letters and their prayerful interest in this work. 
We feel especially grateful to the few churches and persons who have shown by 
their gifts that they believed that these poor Eskimos were included in Matthew 
xxviii, 19. Surely none can be more in need of the gospel than these. With this 
burden upon our hearts, we pray God that in the future this mission may receive 
the support which we think its importance deserves.” 
BAPTIST MISSIONS. 
Mrs. James McWhinnie, superintendent of the Alaska Work of the Woman's 
American Baptist Home Mission Society, sends the following account of the soci- 
ety’s work on Wood Island: 
In 1884 it was decided that the Baptists should establish a mission in Alaska. 
From Mount St. Elias to the Shumagin Islands, with Kadiak as headquarters, was 
set aside as Baptist ground. 
September 22, 1886, marks the beginning of Baptist missions in Alaska. From 
that time until 1890 the work was done by teachers appointed and supported by 
the Government and commissioned by the American Baptist Home Mission Society. 
Mr. and Mrs. W. E. Roscoe, Mr. and Mrs. J. A. Wirth (supported in part by Dr. 
Jackson and friends in Seattle), and Mr. and Mrs. Faodorf were at different times 
Government teachers. These all advocated the establishment of an orphanage as 
the true way of doing missionary work in Alaska. 
This work was undertaken by the Woman’s American Baptist Home Mission 
Society of New England. The frame of a building was purchased and forwarded 
to Alaska in the summer of 1892, In March, 1893, Mr. W. E. Roscoe was sent by 
the society to the territory to select location and conduct the work. 
July 4, 1893, the first child was received into the orphanage. For two years Mr. 
Roscoe labored earnestly in the development of the work, during which time 24 
children received their care in the home. 
In the summer of 1893 Miss Carrie Currant was sent as teacher, but was com- 
peed to return in November on account of ill health. In September, 1894, Miss 
alu C. Goodchild arrived as reenforcement, and continued with the work until 
her marriage, July, 1897. Mr. Roscoe having resigned to return to the States, 
Mr. and Mrs. C. P. Coe were appointed to take charge, and arrived on the field 
June 5, 1895. In the foliowing September Miss Hattie B. Snow was added to the 
force of workers, but was compelled by. broken health to return to her home in 
August, 1897. 
a and Mrs. Coe found 18 children in the home. Since that time 14 have been 
led. 
These children have been received upon different conditions. Some have been 
apprenticed by their parents to the mission until they become of age; others— 
waifs—have been apprenticed by the United States commissioner; others still are 
received from parents who pay a nominal charge for their care. 
The boys are taught gardening, use of tools, care of stock, etc. They cut the 
trees for wood, saw and chop them up for use, carry water, fish and hunt. The 
par are taught to wash, iron, scrub, sew, bake, cook, mend, and care for the 
ouse. 
Religious services are held every day, and in these the children take great inter- 
ce and enjoyment. Theysing and recite Scripture, and make the services largely 
eir own.
-P-A-G-E-495
  EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 1623 
In the past year and a half several improvements that add much to the value 
and appearance of the premises have been added. First was built a woodshed 20 
by 3¢ feet, for storing and cutting wood, with rooms above for play rooms, shop, 
and storage—a very essential improvement when we consider the number of rainy 
days for which Alaska is noted. Next followed a cottage, situated at a distance 
of about two minutes’ walk from the orphanage. Last, but more important than 
the others, came the chapel. It contains one room 26 feet square, one 12 by 20 
feet, and a tower 8 feet square. The whole was completed at a cost of $600. The 
Woman’s American Baptist Home Mission Society p1id one half, the other half 
being raised on Wood Island, or sent by friends jor that purpose. The North 
American Commercial Company, which does business on this island, furnished 
the labor gratis. 
July 26, 1896, the Wood Island Baptist Church was organized with six mem- 
aoe Since that time one, the oldest girl of the orphanage, has been added by 
aptism. 
‘The day school is open to the children of the native villagers. Last year, not- 
withstanding the opposition of the priest, 21 of them were enrolled. For the past 
two winters night school also has been held for the benefit of young men and 
youths. The attendance was gratifying. 
Last year it was Mr. Coe’s privilege, during the summer, to preach to the peo- 
ple at Kadiak every other Sunday. The services were appreciated and would have 
been renewed this summer, but, being the only man on the place, demands on him 
for manual labor made it impossible to do so. The society has already voted to 
employ an industrial teacher, and after he is secured, there will be more time for 
outside missionary work. The cost of our present work is estimated at $4,500 
annually. 
METHODIST MISSIONS, 
The Jesse Lee Home, Unalaska,—In September the home was able to be removed 
from the rented building, which it had occupied for several years, into new and 
commodious quarters of its own. The building is the admiration of all residents. 
It is a large, two-and-a-half-story building, and with the exception of the Govern- 
ment schoolhouse is the most pretentious building in the place. It isin charge 
of two Methodist ladies, Miss Agnes L. Sowle, of Hagaman, N. Y., being princi- 
pal, and Miss Sarah J. Rinch, of Canada, being her assistant. Residing under the 
same roof and giving some assistance outside of school hours are the sisters 
Misses Elizabeth and Ada Mellor, who teach the Government school. 
There are at the present time 30 children in the home belonging to the Aleut 
race, During the last summer one of the girls in the home was taken at the 
expense of a wealthy citizen of Chicago to that city to be educated, and three or 
four others were sent to Captain Pratt’s celebrated school at Carlisle, Pa. 
The school is doing a large preparatory work for that people. If in the near 
future there shall be any native teachers in the Aleutian Islands, if there shall be 
any native Christian homes and native Christian parents, they are now in process 
of being created by that school—the Jesse Lee Memorial Home at Unalaska being 
the only evangelizing influence at work among the Aleuts of Alaska. 
‘When in November the revenue cutter Bear was ordered to the Arctic Ocean to 
try and land a relief party to go overland to the 400 whalers imprisoned in the ice 
and in danger of starvation, north of Point Barrow, Captain Tuttle announced 
through the newspapers of Seattle that he would be very glad to carry free of 
freight any Christmas presents that the citizens might wish to send to Unalaska 
for the destitute Aleut children and the children in the Methodist Home. The 
project was taken up with enthusiasm by the teachers in the public schools of 
that city, and the children in those schools made Christmas presents to the chil- 
dren in Unalaska. To the surprise of every one, about two tons of dolls drums, 
whistles, jumping jacks, games, picture books, candy, etc., were sent in, so that 
the friends of the mission had the satisfaction of knowing that Chrismas was to 
be a very happy day at that distant mission. 
Unalaska Harbor ‘being the natural stopping place for vessels passing from 
Seattle or San Francisco to the Yukon River, has grown into new importance 
through the gold discoveries, so much so that this present winter six iron steam- 
ers are being built in its harbor, employing some two or three hundred white 
workman, and there ought to be a Methodist minister stationed there that these 
men as well as the natives might have gospel privileges. 
The coming and going of so many sailors make it very important that a hos- 
pital should be established at that place, which could be very appropriately done 
in connection with the Methodist mission work,

THE SWEDISH MISSION COVENANT’S MISSIONS IN ALASKA. 
The Rey. D. Nyvall contributes the following account of the operations of the 
society at Yakutat, Unalakhk, and Golovin Bay: 
The mission work, now carried on in Alaska by the Swedish Mission Covenant 
of America, was begun by the Mission Covenant of Sweden. It was attheannual 
conference in Stockholm in 1886 that the Swedish Covenant decided to begin its 
mission among the heathen people in Alaska. They then sent out Mr. A. E. Karl- 
son and Mr. Adolph Lydeil to bezin missions among the Alaskans. 
On the 25th of June, 1887, Mr. Karlson arrived at St. Michaels, in northern 
Alaska, where, owing to the lack of necessary communications, he had to remain 
a whole year before he could return to the United States to procure the necessary 
supplies. In thesummer of 1888 he returned to San Francisco to procure materials 
for a house and other necessaries. 
Mr. Lydell stopped at Yakutat, south of Mount St. Elias. As soon as he had 
determined on the location of his station he went to San Francisco to secure sup- 
plies and provisions, returning to Yakutat in 1888, accompanied by Karl John 
Henrikson, whom he by a special providence of God had accidentally met in Ore- 
gon. Lydell, however, was taken sick immediately after his return to Yakutat. 
Having suffered from a severe pulmonary affection, he was not able to continue 
his missionary work in those cold regions. On the advice of physicians he went 
back to California, and in his stead Mr, Albin Johnson was sent out in 1889. As 
soon as Mr, Lydell’s health permitted he took up the work of a traveling mission- 
ary in the United States, in which work he has since engaged. His work consists 
in traveling among the mission friends to arouse an interest for the Alaska mis- 
sion and to solicit means for the same. In this he has succeeded well. The inter- 
est manifested in this country for this mission is to a great extent due to the work 
of Mr. Lydell. 
At first the missionaries met only with adversities and obstacles. It was notan 
easy task in this cold country to get a home to livein, They succeeded, however, 
in getting some boards, but not sufficient for a house; hence they were compelled 
to go into the woods, fell the trees, and split them with an ax into boards and 
shingles. This was hard work; but they succeeded. They arranged in the newly 
made home first a large room for public gatherings, and even before it was finished 
they assembled the natives in the kitchen and preached to them by means of an 
interpreter. 
From the United States money was plentifully contributed, with which the mis- 
sionaries built a children’s home in Yakutat. The building was a two-story house, 
containing room for the missionaries, room for the children, and a large school- 
room, which also served asa church. In this house twenty-four children were 
educated. In short, the skies of the future appeared almost cloudless. 
Suddenly there came an unexpected stroke as a thunderbolt from a clear sky. 
On the 8th of January, 1892, the home was suddenly burned down, and with it 
nearly all the property of the mission, together with that of the missionaries, was 
destroyed. 
At about the same time that this calamity took place a good step was taken 
toward success. A steam saw had been received the fall before. Henrikson had 
pought this saw with money subscribed for the purpose through the efforts of 
Mr. Lydell. The saw was not yet in working order, but everything was ready for 
its erection when the home burned.. When the home had burned and all the 
books and material for the school had been destroyed, the missionaries got time to 
devote themselves to the erection of the sawmill. This mill was built of logs cut 
in the woods and split with the ax into boards. As all of their blankets and 
clothing with which they paid the natives had burned, they resolved to do all the 
work without any assistance from them. This, however, they were not allowed 
todo. Said the natives, ‘Permit us to work; we will ask no pay. We will eat 
at home, and if you get anything in the future you can repay us.” With their aid 
the work made rapid progress, so the sawmill was in running order by the time 
the first boat arrived in the spring. 
The result of the work of the sawmill was that the entire village was rebuilt. 
It was converted from a number of poor shanties to neat and comfortable lumber 
houses, built along streets, as in our towns. This change took place within a 
couple of years. 
At present there is a congregation at Yakutat of 88 persons who have received 
the Christian baptism. This congregation isorganized in accordance with the same 
principles of our mission congregations in Sweden and America and hold their 
services in the same manner. There is even a Young People’s Society, organized 
with the purpose of joining the young in their work for their Master. This society
-P-A-G-E-497
  EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 1625 
has proved a great help to the young against the temptations to attend the dances 
and festivities of the heathen. 
Knowing what a powerful factor a Christian school is, it is encouraging to learn 
that from 60 to 100 children are educated in the mission school. Although the 
home has not been rebuilt, yet five children are reared and educated at the station. 
The property at this station is valued at $3,570. 
In the spring of 1891 Miss Hannan Sevenson, from Worcester, was sent out to 
superintend the children’s home at Unalaklik. Mr. David Johnson, of Harcourt, 
Iowa, who has been called as school teacher at Unalaklik, went out in her 
company. 
To the credit of the people it must be said that it has been very quiet and peace- 
ful in this community. Drinking parties and rows are seldom heard of. At 
Christmas time and during the week of prayer many were touched by the Holy 
Spirit. We had a full house every evening. The natives sang, prayed, and tes- 
tified. Evena young Shuman arose and said that he should not like to be left 
when the Lord would come, 
At the mission station six boys and three girls have been supported. They are 
all obedient, and live for God. 
In the spring of 1892, Mr. August Anderson, in company with one of the boys at 
the school, made a missionary tour along the western coast. They then came to 
Golovin Bay, where Anderson found many Eskimos in poverty and darkness. He 
asked the natives if they wished to have a school in which their children could 
learn about God. They all answered ‘‘ Yes.” 
Mr. Anderson returned home to Unalaklik and told his brethren what he had 
heard and seen, It was in the summer of this year that Mr. Karlson started on 
his tour through the United States and Sweden. Having reached the States, Mr. 
Karlson began to collect money for the mission at Golovin Bay, receiving at his 
first meeting, whick was held in San Francisco, a collection of $70 as a beginning. 
Arriving at Rockford, Ill., when the Covenant’s annual meeting was in session, he 
put forth his cause orally as well as in a written report. This exerted such an 
influence on the whole meeting that immediately, at the same session, about $1,500 
was raised for the Alaska mission among the delegates. Subscriptions continued 
at the general meetings until the sum was increased to $3,000. We all, who were 
present, remember what a missionary spirit prevailed at this blessed meeting. 
The following summer, when Karlson returned to Alaska, he had in his com- 
pany Mr, N. O, Hultberg and Miss Malvina Johnson. Golovin Bay was assigned 
to Brother Hultberg as his mission field, and he went there directly from St. 
Michaels on the boat which brought up Mr. Karlson. There he met his coworker, 
Mr. August Anderson. They now first had an earnest prayer meeting, after which 
they took up their work with zeal. They got along so well in building their house 
that they could assemble the people during the very same fall. They kept up 
their meetings during the winter. 
The following spring they had the joy of baptizing several natives. The follow- 
ing fall Brother Hultberg left Golovin Bay to assist in the work at Unalaklik, and 
so Mr. Anderson was left alone at Golovin Bay. In the spring Mr. Hultberg made 
his way down to St. Michaels to meet his betrothed. Their wedding took place at 
Unalaklik. The fourth day after their marriage the newly wedded couple went 
to Golovin Bay, where they since have labored. 
We have now in that place a mission house, dwelling house, and a schoolhouse, 
and, better than all, a congregation of Christians numbering 35 members. Forty 
children attend the school, and 4 are supported at the Children’s Home. The mis- 
sion property at this station is valued at $2,525. This sum does not include the 
value of the 160 acres of land, which, according to the laws of the United States, 
belong to the station. 
The members of the congregation at Unalaklik number 40. The school children 
number between 60 and 70. Four children are supported at the Children’s Home. 
The property is valued at $4,490. 
MISSIONS OF THE PROTESTANT EPISCOPAL CHURCH. 
In the Terrritory of Alaska this church has work among the whites at Juneau 
and Douglas and Sitka, and among the Indians of the Yukon region and the 
Eskimo of arctic Alaska, all under the supervision of Bishop P. T. Rowe. The 
following extract is taken from the annual report of the board of managers of the 
Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church: 
“The Rey. Mr. Prevost, whose station at Fort Adams is among the Indians, the 
bishop temporarily removed to Circle City, as it was the more important for the 
moment and a convenient center. In June last the Rev. Mr. Chapman, who, with
-P-A-G-E-498
  1626 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
his faithful wife and Miss Sabine, is stationed at Amvik, 600 miles from the mouth 
of the Yukon, wrote home that the mission school at that place, though unable to 
care for more than two or three boarding pupils, had a most prosperous year. In 
November, and again in December, Mr. Chapman visited the villages upon the 
Chageluk Slough, to the eastward from Anvik. He hopes to establish a school 
there with a native teacher. In April Mr. Chapman made a visit up the Kuskok- 
wim River as far as Vinisahle.” ) 
From Point Hope Dr. Driggs, under date of June 7, reports that on his return to 
duty from a visit to the States he received a joyful and hearty welcome from the 
natives on his arrival at Point Hope. The Doctor has erected a new home for 
himself at this place, in the building of which natives and a few white men assisted. 
The interest in the Sunday services has been very marked, the average attendance 
being 120 and 125. A widespread epidemic of influenza made its appearance dur- 
ing the summer. The outlook here is very encouraging, and Dr. Driggs says: ‘‘I 
doubt if there is a single city or village in the United States where the ratio to the 
population of those who attend worship on Sundays has been as large the past 
winter as it has been here at Point Hope.” 
The statistics last reported are as follows: Stations, Anvik (10 communicants) ; 
Circle City, Indian Mission; Fort Adams (3 communicants); Nowikowkat, Fort 
Yukon (5 communicants); Point Hope. Mr. Prevost reports large numbers of 
baptized Indians within his district. Number of missionaries, 8. 
TATEMENT WITH REGARD TO MR. DUNCAN’S WORK AMONG THE 
TSIMPSHEEAN INDIANS OF BRITISH AMERICA AND ALASKA. 
On the 1st of October, 1857, Mr. William Duncan, of England, arrived at Fort 
Simpson, British Columbia, to open a mission among the Tsimpsheeans. He 
found by actual count that they numbered 2,300. They were barbarians of the 
lowest type, and their history little less than a chapter of crime and misery. 
On the 28th of June, 1858, he had so far acquired a knowledge of the language 
that he was able to open his first school in the house of a chief, with an attendance 
of 26 children and 15 adults, 
In April, 1860, he made preaching tours to the various villages situated on the 
~ rivers which empty into the ocean near Fort Simpson, 
Having secured a few followers among the natives, he proposed to them that 
they remove from the native village, where they were more or less under the 
influence of their heathen neighbors, and establish a new village that should be 
under strict regulations. The removal was accomplished on the 27th of May, 
1860, the people arriving at their new location, 16 miles south of Fort Simpson, 
the next day at 2o’clock. There were 50 men, women, and children, that com- 
posed this first colony. On the 6th of June 290 additional natives joined them. 
very one desiring to settle in the new village was required to subscribe to the 
following agreement: 
1. To give up sorcery. 
2. To cease calling in sorcerers when sick. 
8. To cease gambling. 
4. To cease giving away their property for display. 
5. To cease painting their faces. 
6. To cease drinking intoxicating liquors. 
7. To observe the Sabbath, 
8. To attend religious instruction. 
9. To send their children to school. 
10. To be cleanly. 
11. To be industrious, 
12. To be peaceful. 
13. To be liberal and honest in trade. 
14, To build neat houses, 
15. To pay the village tax. 
The new village, notwithstanding the above stringent regulations, grew very 
rapidly until it had a population of 1,000 natives. They had erected for them- 
selves good, comfortable frame houses; had a steam sawmill, a salmon-canning 
establishment, and a village store owned largely by native shareholders. A num- 
ber of them had learned the carpentry trade, others furniture making, and still 
eure boat building and boot and shoe making and the various industries in 
villages, 
Their prosperity continued until about 1880, when the news of the remarkable 
success of the mission had circulated wherever the English language was known.

This had attracted a great deal of attention to the mission, so much so that the 
Church of England, whose missionary society had originally sent Mr. Duncan to 
the field, thought that the importance of the mission demanded a bishop and one 
was selected, ordained, and sent. The coming of the bishop to the station imme- 
diately started rivalries. If the bishop was to be at the head of the mission, Mr. 
Duncan, who had given his life to the work and had created the mission, would 
have to take a second place, which he could not very well afford todo. On the 
other hand, the bishop could not afford to allow Mr. Duncan to rule and he him- 
self take a second place. 
In the meantime the attention of the Canadian Pacific Railway authorities had 
been attracted to the increasing importance of Northern British Columbia and 
Alaska, and they had sent surveyors for a preliminary survey, with regard to run- 
ning a mail road to the coast at that point. When the people found that the rail- 
road surveyors were driving stakes over the lands that they and their fathers had 
occupied for generations, they protested. Finding that their protests were of no 
avail, they sent a committee to Ottawa to lay their grievances before the Canadian 
Parliament, Securing no redress there, the committee continued their journey to 
London, but were prevented from having a personal interview with the Queen, and 
returned home very much discouraged. Upon agitating the question of their 
personal rights, they found that they had no right whatever to the land that they 
had always supposed to be their own, and that there was no future for their chil- 
dren, under the regulations provided by the Parliament of British Columbia. 
This, in connection with the land difficulties and the difficulties of the church 
combined, made them very much dissatisfied; and finally, in the winter of 1886-87, 
they sent their leader, Mr. Duncan, to Washington, to confer with the President, 
Secretary of the Interior, and leading officials of cur Government, the result of 
which was that in the spring of 1887 they concluded to leave British Columbia and 
move in a body to the contiguous Territory of Alaska, in the United States. They 
supposed, of course, that they would be allowed to take down the houses which 
they owned, and transport their windows, doors, lumber, etc., over to their new 
home, which was about 60 miles north of the old place. They were, however, 
disappointed in this, as an official of the British Columbia Government forbade 
their taking anything. And this people, that had slowly come up from barbarians 
to civilization, were compelled to go out empty-handed, leaving behind them all 
the property which they had accumulated during those nearly thirty years that 
they had been emerging from barbarism to civilization. 
On the 7th of August, Mr. Duncan returned from Washington and landed at 
Port Chester, on Annette Island, the place that had been selected for their new 
home. It was a great gala day for the people. A United States flag, donated to 
them by the ladies of Philadelphia, in Independence Hall, was flung to the breeze 
with cheers and firing of guns. Addresses were made by Mr. Duncan and several 
tourists who were with him on thesteamer. A prayer for God’s blessing followed, 
and the public exercises were closed by the people singing with great ardor the 
doxology, ‘‘ Praise God from whom all blessings flow.” 
The timber was cleared off a number of acres for a village, which was duly 
surveyed and plotted and allotted to the inhabitants. A steam sawmill and a 
large store’ building were erected. Friends in Brooklyn, New York, and other 
cities sent several thousand dollars for public improvements. Since then a large 
schoolhouse, church, and salmon cannery have been erected. 
Congress, in section 15 of the act entitled ‘‘An act to repeal timber-culture laws, 
and for other purposes,” approved March 3, 1891 (26 Stats., 1095), has reserved 
Annette Island for the colony. Section 15 of the above-mentioned act reads as 
follows: 
“‘ Until otherwise provided by law, the body of lands known as Annette Island, 
situated in the Alexander Archipelago, in southeastern Alaska, on the north side 
of Dixon’s entrance, be, and the same is hereby, set apart as a reservation for the 
use of the Metlakahtla Indians and these people known as Metlakahtlans who 
have recently emigrated from British Columbia to Alaska and such other Alaskan 
natives as may join them, to be held and used by them in common, under such 
rules and regulations and subject to such restrictions as may [be] prescribed from 
time to time by the Secretary of the Interior.” 
In British Columbia they have formed a local government, which they trans- 
ferred with themselves to their settlement on Annette Island. This local govern- 
ment is officially known by them as ‘‘ The Town and Associated Community of 
Metlakahtla.” An annual election is held by the members of the ‘‘ community.” 
This council makes the laws, and is the governing power of the people. Every 
person desiring to unite with the community is required to make application to 
the “council” for membership. If the request is granted, the new member sub-

scribes to the following rules, which have superseded those in force when the 
colony was organized: 
We, the people of Metlakahtla, Alaska, in order to secure to ourselves and our 
posterity the blessings of a Christian home, do severally subscribe to the following

Already before migrating to Annette Island Mr. Duncan had introduced these 
elements of civilization. Many of his tribe were individual owners of the village

The island is about 40 miles long by 3 wide. The colony on Annette Island have 
cleared off the timber from their village site, erected from 150 to 200 good frame 
residences, established a cooperative store, salmon cannery, and steam sawmill, 
and built a large church; but, so far as known to this office, nothing has been 
actually done in mining, although it is known that projects in this direction have 
been under consideration by them. All the industries are carried on by the native 
people themselves, under the leadership of Mr. William Duncan.   
  
INTRODUCTION OF DOMESTIC REINDEER INTO ALASKA. 
The progress has been satisfactory and an advance has been made during the 
year. 
While no purchases have been made in Siberia, 466 deer have been added to the 
herds by birth, making a total on June 30, 1897, of 1,466. A new station has been 
established about 60 miles north of St. Michael, Norton Sound. This location is 
on the north shore of Unalaklik River, about 10 miles above its mouth, and com- 
bines a central position, with dry and abundant pasturage, good fishing, timber
-P-A-G-E-501
EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 1629 
for building and fuel, with easy access to the ocean. The new station is central for 
the distribution of the herds either northward to Kotzebue Sound, Point Hope, 
and Point Barrow; southward to the Roman Catholic and Moravian stations on 
the Lower Yukon, Kuskokwim, and Nushagak rivers, or eastward to the Epis- 
copal stations and mining settlements on the Upper Yukon Valley, being about 
the same distance from Bering Straits on the west, Point Barrow upon the north, 
the Middle Yukon Valley on the east, and the Kuskokwim Valley on the south. 
Located in the neighborhood of the leading mission stations among the native 
populations, it will be able to draw and educate as herders and teamsters a larger 
number of the native young men. 
At the Teller Reindeer Station no additional buildings have been erected or 
were needed during the year. Three sod houses 16 by 10 feet in size lined with 
lumber were erected at the winter quarters for 1896-97 on the Agheeopak River 
for shelter of herders and their families. Several smaller sod huts were erected 
at various places between the Teller Station and Agheeopak as a refuge for the 
herders while en route to and from the station. A few log dwellings and store 
houses will this winter be erected at the new station on the Unalaklik River. The 
buildings at the Teller Station, with furniture, boats, sleds, harness, nets, and 
other property of the Government, are in good repair. 
PERSONNEL. 
Mr. William A. Kjellmann, who resigned the position of superintendent in the 
fail of 1895, having expressed a willingness to again enter the service, was reap- 
pointed to his former position as superintendent. 
A. N. Kittilsen, M. D., of Stoughton, Wis., was likewise appointed assistant 
superintendent and physician, and the Rev. T. L. Brevig continued as teacher. 
Herders.—The Lapps continue to justify the wisdom of their importation from 
Lapland, embodying in their own training and skill the knowledge and methods 
learned by their people through centuries of experience and observation. Their 
services in Alaska are invaluable. 
In the introduction of reindeer into Alaska and the training of native men in 
their management and care it is important that that training should be in accord- 
ance with the latest and most improved methods of handling reindeer; that the 
Lapps possess these above all other nationalities is universally recognized. Their 
assistance has proved so valuable and is so essential to the immediate future that 
Mr, Kjellmann has gone with your consent to Lapland this winter to secure and 
bring over a permanent colony of them. The Lapps now in Alaska were brought 
over with the understanding that they would be returned at the end of three 
years; this was the best arrangement that could be made at the time. The limit 
of service being reached, Messrs. Rist, Somby, Kemi, and Hira. with their families, 
have returned to Lapland. Messrs. Tornensis, Nakkila, and Larsen have been 
prevailed upon toremain, with the expectation that they will become herd owners 
and permanent citizens. 
During the winter of 1896-97 Messrs. Rist and Nakkila were detailed to accom- 
pany the superintendent on his sledge journey to the Yukon and Kuskokwim val- 
leys. Mr. Aslak L. Somby remained in charge of the herds at Golovin Bay until 
March, when he returned to the Teller Station and was sent to the Cape Nome 
herd to relieve Mr. M. A. Eira, whose wife needed the medical attendance of the 
station physician. 
Mr. Frederick Larsen was detailed for a month’s service with the herd at Cape 
Prince of Wales. Messrs. Tornensis and Kemi had charge of the Teller Station 
herd, except as one or the other made short trips with the physician. 
Apprentices.—The school of apprentices consists of the same persons as last 
year—five married and two unmarried Eskimos. They have shown an alacrity in 
work, a faithful adherence to instructions, and an effort to understand all parts of 
the work that augurs well for their future success. 
Rations.—During the year a change has been made in the rations, decreasing 
the amount of American food (such as flour and meats brought from the outside) 
and increasing the amount of native food (such as fish, seal, and oil). 
School.—As the herders and apprentices have been with the herd 60 miles away 
from the station much of the time, the school has been mostly composed of Eskimo 
children, resident in the immediate vicinity of the station. Although debarred 
regular schooling, both the Lapps and apprentices are slowly acquiring the Eng- 
lish tongue. The superintendent recommends that some of the young people be 
given a few years at school in the States to learn English. 
        
ckness.—Dr. Kittilsen, the physician, has attended to 60 cases of sickness 
among the employees or their families and 250 cases among the outside Eskimos,   
 
-P-A-G-E-502

who have in some cases come 200 miles on a dog sled to secure medical attendance. 
There was but one fatal case at the station, being Mrs. Hira, who remained too 
long at Cape Nome before applying for help. She passed to her rest May 4, 1897. 
HERD. 
On the 1st of July, 1897, there were in Alaska 1,466 head of domestic reindeer. 
These are divided into four herds, and located as follows:

ear ee ee ee ee ee, eee 1, 466 
ane Government herd was wintered on the Agheepak River 20 miles from its 
mouth. 
In the spring it was driven to the south side of Eaton River as a more favorable 
place for fawning, and this summer has been kept on the south side of Port Clar- 
ence in the neighborhood of Cape Riley. 
Fawning.—There were born at the Teller Station 149 living fawns, at Cape 
Prince of Wales 124, at Golovin Bay 108, and at Cape Nome 85, making an increase 
for the year of 466, 
Sickness.—In the fall of 1895, and again in the fall of 1896, a disease broke out 
in the herd similar to foot-rot in sheep. With a change of the herd to drier 
ground the sickness gradually abated. 
Breaking.—Special attention has been given to the training of the reindeer both 
to harness and the pack saddle. During last winter 46 two and three year old 
deer were thus broken. This makes 73 well broken and trained sled deer in the 
Government herd. Inthe herd at Golovin Bay are 18 sled deer, and at Cape Prince 
of Wales 22. 
At the Teller Station the sled deer were kept in constant practice, both on their 
own account and also for the training of the Eskimo apprentices. Including the 
trip Re the Kuskokwim Valley the aggregate number of miles driven was over 
10,000. : 
This practice will be kept up, preparatory to their introduction into the mining 
camps for freighting and traveling. 
  REINDEER FREIGHTING. 
The first incentive to the introduction of domestic reindeer into Alaska came as 
an act of humanity to provide a new food supply for the Eskimos, who were sub- 
ject to periodical seasons of starvation, their old food supply of whale, walrus, and 
wild animals having been partially destroyed by the greed of white men. But 
since the discovery of goid mines in subarctic Alaska and the consequent influx of 
thousands of miners, it has been found that the reindeer is as essential to the 
white man as to the Eskimo. 
The first thought of the miner in central Alaska is to secure a good * claim ;” 
his next thought is the question of ‘food supply ”’—whether he can secure pro- 
visions that will enable him to work his claim continuously, or whether for the 
want of such provisions he will be compelled to leave his claim unworked a por- 
tion of the year while he goes where he can secure food—not only losing the profit 
that would accrue from the claim if worked, but also involving him in heavy 
traveling expenses in going to and fro. 
With the exception of fish, a little wild game, and a limited quantity of garden 
vegetables, there is no food in the country. All breadstuffs, vegetables, fruits, 
and the larger portion of the meat supply must be brought into the country from 
the outside. A small quantity of provisions is packed on sleds and on men’s 
shoulders and brought over the passes in the Chilkat country of southeast Alaska 
to the head waters of the Yukon; there barges or flatboats are built, and with their 
freight are floated down the Yukon River to the neighborhood of the mines. The 
great bulk of the food supply, however, is brought in on steamers plying on the 
Yukon River. These provisions are necessarily left in warehouses on the banks of 
the great river. But the miners, who are the consumers, need them at their 
claims, which are from 10 to 100 miles away from the river. Now, it should be 
remembered that there are no roads in Alaska as they exist in other sections of the 
United States; and, with thealmost illimitable area of bog and swamp and tundra
-P-A-G-E-503
EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 1631 
and frozen subsoil, it will be impossible to make and maintain roads, except ata 
cost that would be practically prohibitive. 
I summer the supplies are loaded intosmall boats, which are poled up the small 
streams or packed on men’s backs to the mines. In winter they are hauled on 
dog sleds. This costs heavily. From Circle City to the Birch Creek mines, a dis- 
tance of about 50 miles, the freight is 10 cents a pound ($200 a ton) in winter and 
40 cents in summer ($800 aton). From Dawson to the Klondike mines, a distance 
of 15 miles, the freight last winter was 8 cents a pound ($160 a ton),and this sum- 
mer 25 cents, or $500 a ton of freight 15 miles. In addition to the expense, the 
carrying capacity is too limited. A load is from 100 to 125 pounds on a sled per 
dog, a portion of which is food for the dogs, and if the route is a long one, with- 
out intervening sources of supply, they can not carry more food than is sufficient 
for themselves. So far they have failed in supplying the mines with a sufficient 
stock of provisions. 
Last winter the steamer Bella was caught in the ice and frozen up at Fort 
Yukon, 80 miles distant from CircleCity. An-effort was made to forward the pro- 
visions with dog teams on the ice, but it was a failure. The food could not be 
moved in sufficient quantities and with sufficient speed to supply the miners of the 
Upper Yukon, and by spring at Dawson City flour ran up to over $100 per barrel, 
$50 to $125 per 100 pounds. 
A few horses have been brought into the country, but in the absence of roads, 
scarcity of food, and rigor of winter climate they have not proved a success. At 
Dawson, although the wages of a man and team are $50 a day, yet even that does 
not pay, with hay at $125 to $150 per ton (and not.a pound to be had when I was 
there in July even at those figures), and the horses fed on bread made from flour 
ranging in price from $100 to $200 per barrel. 
The only solution of the question of reasonable land transportation and rapid 
communication and travel between mining centers hundreds of miles apart in 
subarctic Alaska is the introduction and utilizing of domestic reindeer. 
The reindeer is to the far north what the camel is to desert regions, the animal 
which God has provided and adapted for the peculiar, special conditions which 
exist. The greater the degree of cold, the better the reindeer thrives. Last winter 
a party of them hauling nine sleds made a day’s journey with the temperature at 
73° below zero, On along journey through an uninhabited country a dog team 
can not haul sufficient provisions to feed themselves. A deer, with 200 pounds on 
the sled, can travel up and down the mountains.and over the plains without a road 
or trail from one end of Alaska to the other, living on the moss found in the coun- 
try where hetravels. In the four months’ travel of 2,000 miles last winter the deer 
were turned out at night to find their own provisions, except upon a stretch of the 
Yukon Valley below Anvik, a distance of 40 miles, The great mining interests of 
central Alaska can not realize their fullest development until the domestic reindeer 
are introduced in sufficient numbers to do the work of supplying the miners with 
provisions and freight and giving the miner speedy communication with the out- 
side world. It now takes from fifty to sixty daysto carry the mail between Juneau 
and Circle City. With the establishment of relay stations.at suitable distances the 
reindeer teams will carry the same mail in four or five days. 
The reindeer is equally important to the prospector. Prospecting ata distance 
from the base of supplies is now impossible. The prospector can go only as far.as 
the 100 pounds of provisions, blankets, .and tools will last him, and then he must 
return. With ten head of reindeer, packing 100 pounds each, making half a ton 
of supplies, he can be gone for months, penetrating regions hundreds of miles dis- 
tant, his deer grazing wherever night finds him, The possibilities are so great, 
that in the days to come it will be a matter.of surprise that the utilization of the 
deer was not vigorously pushed at the start. 
SIBERIAN PURCHASE STATION. 
In 1892 the introduction of domestic reindeer into Alaska was undertaken to 
rovide a new food supply for the Eskimo. The new demand that has now arisen 
to assist the miners in the opening of the country emphasizes the imperative need 
some method of procuring the deer from Siberia in larger numbers. To assist in 
last winter permission was secured from the Russian Government at St. Peters- 
through the regular official channels, for the United States to locate an agent 
at some suitable point on the coast of Siberia for the continuous purchase of rein- 
deer through the year. Hitherto the work of purchasing has been confined to five 
or six weeks in summer. 
By extending the time for purchasing through the whole year it is hoped to be 
able to secure a large number and have them on the coast ready for transporta- 
         
-P-A-G-E-504
  1632 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
tion during the short summer, when Bering Sea and the adjacent arctic coast are 
free from ice. Mr. John W. Kelly, who has spent years in arctic Alaska and is 
familiar with the conditions of the country, was appointed agent. Associated 
with him are Conrad Siem and Mr. A. St. Leger, both of whom have had years of 
experience with the natives of the Arctic. 
A good opportunity offering, Conrad Siem took passage on the whaler Bonanza 
May 29. Mr. Kelly, with supplies and stock of barter goods, sailed from San 
Francisco June 9 on the schooner Volant, reaching St. Lawrence Bay, Siberia, on 
July 17, three days after the arrival of Mr. Siem. 
When the needs of the reindeer for domestication and transportation are met, 
early steps should be taken to stock the larger islands of Alaska, especially those 
in Bering Sea and along the Aleutian group. 
In Dr. G. Hartwig’s Polar World, page 89, it is stated that ‘In the year 1770 
thirteen reindeer were brought into Iceland from Norway. Ten died on the pas- 
sage, but the three which survived have multiplied so fast that large herds now 
(1869) roam over the uninhabited wastes. During the winter, when hunger drives 
them into the lower districts, they are frequently shot, but no attempts have been 
made to tame them.” 
A WINTER TRIP OF 2,000 MILES, 
Since the commencement of the herd in 1892 the obstacles that it was predicted 
would prevent the successful introduction of domestic reindeer into Alaska have 
either been proved to be groundless or have one by one been met and overcome. 
Having shown by actual experience that they could be bought, transported, and 
successfully propagated, it remained to give a practical demonstration of their 
ability to traverse any part of the country under the most unfavorable circum- 
stances and with a temperature at times lower than experienced by some of the 
Arctic expeditions. 
This was done last winter, in accordance with your directions. At 3p. m.on 
the 10th of December, 1896, with the temperature at 15° below zero, Mr. William 
A. Kjellmann, the superintendent, accompanied _ by the Lapps Per Aslaksen Rist 
and Mikkel J. Nakkila, started from the Teller Station with 9 sleds and 17 head 
of reindeer to demonstrate the capacity of the hardy and swift animal for winter 
travel in Alaska. Native trails and well-known sections of country were ignored, 
to show their ability to go anywhere. The course, while traveled by compass, 
was a zigzag one, in order to better learn the extent and abundance of moss pas- 
turage. Scaling high mountain ranges, shooting down precipitous declivities 
with tobogganing speed, plodding through valleys filled with deeply drifted snow, 
laboriously cutting a way through the man-high underbrush of the forest, or steer- 
ing across the trackless tundra, never before trodden by the foot of white man; 
gliding over the hard-crusted snow, or wading through slush 2 feet deep on imper- 
fectly frozen rivers unknown to geographers, were the experiences of the trip. 
The second day of the journey, with the temperature 43° below zero, and over 
a rough, broken, and pathless country, they made a distance of 60 miles. 
After celebrating Christmas with Rev. Mr. Hultberg and the Swedish mission- 
aries on Golovin Bay, December 30 found Mr. Kjellmann’s party crossing Norion 
Sound, an arm of Bering Sea, and getting into a crevasse filled with snow, from 
which they escaped without much damage. 
The next day, keeping on the ice along the coast, hummocks were found so 
steep that steps had to be cut up and over them to enable the deer to cross. 
On New Year’s day, coming to a flagstaff projecting from a huge snow bank, 
they found under it, completely buried in the snow, the comfortable home of the 
Rey. Mr. Karlsen and the Swedish missionaries at Unalaklik. On the afternoon 
of January 11 and morning of the 12th, 85 miles were made in twelve hours. The 
native guides at St. Michael being afraid to undertake a winter trip across the 
country to Ikogmute, the Russian mission on the Yukon River, and affirming 
that it could not be done, Mr, Kjellmann started on January 19 without them, 
traveling by compass. 
On the 23d, while crossing a barren mountain range, they were overtaken by 
that dread specter of arctic regions, a Russian poorga.' Neither man nor beast 
could stand against the blast. The reindeer were blown down and the loaded 
sleds overturned. The men, throwing themselves flat, clung to one another and 
to mother earth to keep from being blown away. Stones and pieces of crushed 
ice flew by, darkening the air. A lull coming toward evening, with great diffi- 
culty a little coffee was made, after which the storm broke with renewed fury 
during a night which to the travelers, clinging to the earth with desperation,

seemedendless. The following day a belt of timber was reached and rest and safety 
secured. January 25 and 26 found them cutting a way for the deer and sleds 
through a dense forest, from which they finally emerged to wade through snow 
and water 2 feet deep and the temperature at zero. On the 8ist they encountered 
a succession of driving, blinding snowstorms while crossing the tundra south of 
the Yukon delta, being reduced to such straits that they were compelled to cut 
the railing from their sleds for fuel. On February 5 the storm passed away, leay- 
ing the temperature at 73° below zero, causing even the reindeer to break loose 
from their tethers and tramp ceaselessly around the tents for warmth. 
Notwithstanding the severe cold the journey was continued, and at 2 o’clock in 
the afternoon they found shelter and a warm welcome from the Moravian mis- 
sionaries at Bethel. On the 10th of March, between the Kuskokwim and Yukon 
rivers, a lake 15 miles wide was crossed. 
The struggle for life commenced, however, on the 11th, when they reached the 
Yukon, and, contrary to information, found no moss for the deer. A push was 
made up the Yukon to reach, if possible, the Episcopal mission at Anvik. There 
being no food, the march was kept up all night, plowing their way through loose 
snow from 2 to 4 feet deep, and on through the 12th with snow falling fast. That 
afternoon two of the deer fell dead and were left with their sleds where they fell, 
while the journey continued uninterruptedly through the blinding snow the second 
night. On the 18th two more deer dropped dead and were abandoned, as the 
party with desperate energy pushed ahead day and night for food and life, On 
the 14th another deer fell in his traces. That evening a native hut was reached 
and the continuous march of four days and three nights without sleep or rest and 
without food for the deer was over. Trees were cut down by the Lapps that the 
deer might browse on the black moss that hung from them, while Mr. Kjellmann, 
suffering with a high fever, was put to bed by the medicine woman, and dosed 
with tea made from some medicinal bark. On the 17th one of the Lapps, who 
had been scouring the country, reported moss upon a mountain 60 miles away. 
The deer were unharnessed and driven to the distant pasturage, while Mr. Kjell- 
mann continued his journey to Anvik on skis. In the hospitable home of Rev. 
Mr. Chapman he was nursed back to health and strength. 
The return journey to the Teller Station was made without any special adven- 
ture, except, on the 16th of April, getting into a crack in the ice while crossing 
Norton Sound and soaking the load with salt water. On the 24th of April the 
Teller Station was safely reached after a trip of 2,000 miles, the longest ever 
recorded in any land as made by the same reindeer. 
The result of this trial trip has convinced missionaries, miners, traders, and 
others residing in northern and central Alaska that domestic reindeer can do for 
them what they have been doing forcenturies in Lapland. That when introduced 
in sufficient numbers they will supplant dogs, both for traveling and freighting, 
furnish a rapid means of communication between widely separated communities, 
foul render possible the full and profitable development of the rich mineral 
interests. ' 
A TRIP UP THE YUKON. 
During July and August, through the courtesy of the North American Trading 
and Transportation Company, I was able to take Mr. William A. Kjellmann and 
make a trip of 1,600. miles up the Yukon River. This trip was made to secure for 
you the information you sought with regard to the adaptation of the country for 
reindeer and the special conditions which will meet the introduction of reindeer 
freighting. The results of the trip were satisfactory, and I returned more than 
ever deeply impressed that the great pressing need of the hour is more reindeer 
and more Lapps. Z 
BRANDING, 
As year by year increasing numbers of reindeer are passing into the ownership 
of the apprentices and missions, and as others are looking forward to ownership in 
the near future, it is important that rules should be formulated for the regulation 
and registering of brands that mark such ownership. 
ITINERARY. 
Leaving Washington on the ist of June last, I embarked at Seattle on the steam- 
ship Portland, of the North American Transportation and Trading Company, on 
the 12th, reaching Unalaska, Dutch Harbor, on the 2ist. Two days were spent at. 
Unalaska visiting the school and attending to school matters.

At 5.80a.m. on the 23d our steamship sailed for St. Michael. On the 25th we 
reached the ice and all day skirted the ice floe, reaching St. Michael at 1 o’clock on 
the morning of the 27th. 
On the 28th the Yukon River steamer Portus B. Weare arrived, having on 
board a large number of miners with half a million dollars’ worth of gold dust 
from Klondike and the Yukon mines. It was the arrival of this steamer with its 
treasure on July 17, 1897, at Seattle that aroused the attention of the world. 
Tho 29th was signalized by the arrival of the cutter Bear, Capt. Francis Tuttle 
incommand. The Bear had on its upward trip called at St. Lawrence Island, St. 
Lawrence Bay, Cape Princeof Wales, and Teller Reindeer Station, bringing favor- 
able reportsfrom the several stations; italso brought toSt. Michael Mr. William A. 
Kjellman, superintendent of the Reindeer Station, whom I wished to accompany 
me on a trip upon the Yukon River Valley, that he might investigate the supply 
of reindeer moss and ascertain the conditions that must be met in the establish- 
ment of future reindeer freighting establishments from the provision warehouses 
on the river back to the interior mines. 
On the 8d of July I transferred from the ocean steamship Portland to the river 
steamer Portus B. Weare, and on the morning of the 5th we left the wharf at St. 
Michael for the mouth of the Yukon River. Owing to the great quantities of silt 
brought down in the waters of the Yukon, Bering Sea has so shoaled that ocean 
steamers at present are unable to reach nearer the mouth of the river than St. 
Michael, which is 60 miles north of the river, on the coast of Bering Sea. 
At 10 o’clock the steamer reached Pastolik, where a stop was made to take on 
firewood. Half an hour later we entered the north pass of the delta and at 11.30 
went aground on the bar, where we lay for twenty-four hours, until lifted off by 
the tide. Although there was a cold, drizzling rain, a number of the passengers 
went on shore to hunt geese and ducks, which are plentiful at that season of the 
iid At high tide, July 6, the steamer again floated, and, taking on wood near 
‘utlik, we started up the river. 
Tho Yukon is one of the great rivers of the world. Takingits rise in the moun- 
tains of the Northwest Territory of Canada, it flows across the entire width of 
Alaska from east to west, dividing that greatTerritory into two nearly equal parts. 
Its delta stretches for 20 miles along the sea and extends 100 miles inland, a dis- 
tance so great that, standing upon one shore of the delta, the table-lands bordering 
the other can not be seen. This great delta is comparable to that of the Mississippi 
River in the accumulated silt of years, which greatly extends the area of the land 
into the sea, shoaling the navigable waters of the sea to such an extent that ocean 
vessels bound for St. Michael are compelled, while passing the mouth of the river, 
to make a detour to the westward. Through its whole course the river, like the 
Missouri, carries a large amount of sediment in its waters, and the extent of its 
deposits upon its delta will not be wondered at after the observer has traversed its 
length and seen a thousand miles of banks undermined and ready to be swept away. 
Like the McKenzie River of Canada and the Lena of Siberia, which rise in the 
south and flow northward, the Yukon feels the influence of the warmer tempera- 
ture of spring first at its source. The ice brought down by the strong freshets of 
the Upper Yukon is piled upon the firm unbroken ice of the lower stream, with the 
result of accumulating great masses of ice and water until the weight of the ice 
and the increased pressure of the gathered waters force out a section of the bank. 
This process is repeated again and again lower down the river. The breaking up 
of the ice on the Yukon is one of the grand sights of earth, rivaling in interest the 
remarkable auroras of the winter monthsin thatnorthernlatitude. Uponsuchocca- 
sions, great masses of ice from 8 to 10 feet thick are hurled with Titanic force into 
the river banks, gouging out yards of soil and uprooting great trees before their 
momentum is checked, Thus unceasingly through the centuries this great stream 
goes on leveling down the hills of central Alaska, picking up the soil and carrying 
it in solution hundreds of miles to the coast, and it is deposited where the fresh 
water meets the salt of the sea. The trees thus carried out to sea are nature’s pro- 
vision for the Eskimos on the treeless coast of Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean, 
driftwood being their only fuel. This vast delta region of the Yukon is filled with 
marshes and lakes and is liable to overflows; it is also a breeding ground of innu- 
merable wild geese and other fowl. 
The river is navigable for light-draft steamers for 2,000 miles to Fort Selkirk 
and even beyond that point, with short portages around rapids, while its tributa- 
ries—the Anvik, Koyukuk, Tanana, Porcupine, White, Pelly, and other rivers— 
are navigable for from 100 to 600 miles. 
A middle-aged lady who was following her husband to live in this wilderness 
was so impressed with the continuous steaming ‘up this great river day and night, 
week after week for three weeks, without passing a single large town, and only

seeing small Indian settlements, or here and there a fishing camp or trader’s post, 
while the great yellow flood seemed to flow on with but little diminution in vol- 
ume, that she felt as if she had been on the river for ages, and broke out with the 
exclamation, ‘‘ Will it never come to an end; must I continue to go on and on for 
ever and ever?” and retiring to her stateroom found relief in a good cry. 
At5a.m.on July 7 the steamer reached the head of the delta, where another 
supply of firewood was taken on board. Indeed, during the whole trip the steamer 
seemed to stop about every six hours for wood. The river is lined with white 
pine, which is cut by the natives and piled up convenient for the steamers. This 
wood costs from $4 to $6 per cord, and the steamer uses from 25 to 30 cords a day. 
Leaving the head of the delta, low hills begin to appear along the north bank of the 
river. For 300 miles farther the river was so wide that in places, standing upon 
one bank, the other could not be seen. 
At 8.30 a. m. we reached Andreafski, 216 miles from St. Michael, where we 
stopped for wood, and also for mending our boiler pipes, which were leaking badly. 
At this village were several well-hewn log houses, back of which were a number 
of graves, the dead being deposited in boxes laid on top of the ground. All cen- 
tral and northern Alaska, including the Yukon Valley, has a frozen subsoil which 
never thaws out. This has been dug into 30 feet without getting below the frost, 
On the banks of some of the streams north of the Yukon a stratum of frozen soil 
has been found over 100 feet thick, Yet to look upon the acres of brilliant wild 
flowers and of grasses waist high, and miles upon miles of white pine, aspen, and 
willows, with the thermometer above 100° in the shade, it is very difficult to realize 
that one is under the Arctic Circle. 
Owing to the difficulty and almost impossibility of digging graves in the frozen 
ground with rude native implements, the custom universally prevails of deposit- 
ing ee dead in boxes either on the ground or on platforms above the reach of wild 
animals. 
At Andreafski we first met the birch-bark canoe, showing that this village was 
on the border land between the Eskimos of the coast and the Indians of the Inte- 
rior, the universal boat of the Eskimos being the skin-covered kiak and that of the 
Indian the birch-bark canoe. Andreafski has secured some prominence this season 
as the point to which provision supplies from St. Michael that could not be taken 
to the mines on the upper courses of the river were landed for winter use, and also 
to be accessible to the river steamers in the early spring, the ice in the Yukon 
River breaking sometimes a month in advance of the ice in Bering Sea. This 
permits the river steamers to load up in the spring and go to the head waters of 
the river and return down the stream to the coast by the time that ocean steamers 
can reach St. Michael through the ice of Bering Sea. 
The low shoals which were encountered at the ocean side of the delta gradually 
increase in size as the river is ascended until at the head of the delta they become 
islands, upon which poplars and willows are found 20 to 30 feet high. 
Soon after leaving Andreafski, scattered white pine began to appear. Leaving 
Andreafski and rounding a bold promontory, we passed the mouth of Andreafski 
River, a broad stream flowing from the north and passing through a gold-bearing 
country. Two miners were reported as having been seen on the stream some 
months working mines. 
At 9a.m.on July 8 we reached Ikogmute, or, as it is more popularly known, 
the Russian Mission. It has a population of 150 natives, and is 315 miles by way 
of the river from St. Michael. At this place Father Belkoff, the former priest of 
the Oriental Greek Church (now an invalid) built one of the best church build- 
ings belonging to that denomination in Alaska. Father Orloff, the present priest, 
has an excellent garden on the hill slope in the rear of the parsonage. Just above 
the village, bold and perpendicular rock cliffs save the village from being swept 
away by the great yellow floods which sweep along their base, or ice gorges which 
form each spring in its vicinity. Along the entire village front were racks cov- 
ered with salmon hung up to dry for the winter. The run of salmon this season 
has proved very large. A year ago the run of fish was correspondingly poor, and 
as aresult last winter there was great scarcity of food among the people. One 
woman and a boy actually starved to death. 
At 2 o’clock in the morning of July 9 the steamer reached Koserefski (410 miles). 
This is the location of the largest mission of the Roman Catholic Church on the 
Yukon River. A number of passengers remained up to visit the mission, but 
upon going to the buildings found everything securely locked, and the teachers so 
soundly asleep that they were unaware of the presence of the steamer. 
After breakfast the steamer reached Anvik (457 miles), where we remained 
three-quarters of an hour to get wood for the steamer. On shore, chained to 
posts, were from twelve to fifteen sled dogs belonging to the villagers. These dogs
-P-A-G-E-508
  1636 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
are found in every settlement and fishing camp in Alaska. They are a cross 
between the dog and the wolf, receiving but little attention from their owners. 
When not upon their journey they subsist chiefly by foraging and become adept 
thieves, so that everything eatable, even their own harness, has to be stored away 
on platforms above their reach. This has given rise to the custom everywhere pre- 
vailing along the Yukon River and in northern and central Alaska of erecting 
small log houses upon platforms elevated 10 or 12 feet above the ground. These 
houses are used for storing dried fish and other property that needs to be kept 
beyond the reach of the dogs. Among other things, these dogs are celebrated for 
their habit of howling at night. Upon the approach of a stranger some dog will 
set up a howl, upon which all the dogs within hearing will join in. There may 
not be over a dozen dogs in the neighborhood, but when they commence to howl 
a stranger would be sure that there were a hundred, if not a thousand, of them. 
These dogs are the common carriers of Alaska, dragging sleds in winter and car- 
rying packsin summer. The average load of a dog sled is 125 pounds. The great 
drawback to their use is the necessity of carrying food for them on long journeys. 
A team of dogs carrying freight requires a second team of dogs for hauling food 
for the two teams, and when a journey is required through an unsettled section 
of the country dogs become unavailable because of the impossibility of carrying 
sufficient food or procuring fresh supplies for the teams. This difficulty will be 
overcome when domestic reindeer are introduced into Alaska in sufficient num- 
bers to dispense with the use of dogs. The reindeer will haul heavier loads and 
cover greater distances than the dogs and require no transportation of food for 
its own maintenance. When the day’s work is done they can be turned out to 
graze, even in the severest weather of the winter. The reindeer is to the arctic 
and subarctic regions what the camel is to the oriental and tropical lands. 
Anvik is the first of a series of missions of the Protestant Episcopal Church. 
The missionaries at this point are the Rey. and Mrs. J. W. Chapman and Miss B. 
Sabine. Mr. Chapman has, under great difficulties, erected a neat little chapel, a 
comfortable residence, schoolrooms, and boarding house for the shelter of the 
Indian children taken into the home. A small sawmill has also been erected in 
connection with the mission. 
From the mouth of the river to its source, through all the vast Yukon Valley 
with its tributaries—indeed all over central and northern Alaska—mosquitoes 
abound in July and August in such numbers as to become a veritable plague. The 
hot sun of summer thawing the frozen ground for a few inches leaves water stand- 
ing, unable to soak away through the frozen subsoil beneath, converting the whole 
country into one immense swamp, from which are bred clouds of mosquitoes. 
They are so great an infliction that some of the teachers declare that the extreme 
cold of winter (77° below zero) is preferable to the mosquito time in summer, and 
strong, vigorous men accustomed to hardships have been known to sit down on the 
ground and cry like children under the torture of mosquitoes. While the river 
steamers are in motion the passengers are not much troubled with them, but when 
a landing is made for putting on freight or taking on wood the mosquitoes swarm 
aboard in quantities, compelling the use of netting for the protection of the head 
and face and of leather gloves for the hands. Wild animals sometimes die from 
the effects of their stings. 
On Saturday, July 10, while “ wooding up,” the passengers picked wild currants 
justturningred, They also found protruding from the bank of the river ice, which 
was brought on board. We were now at a point where in winter the natives are 
accustomed to portage across the country to Unalaklik and thence down the coast 
to St. Michael. From St. Michael by way of the river is 550 miles, across the 
portage about 150 miles, making a saving in distance of 400 miles, 
At midnight we reached Nulato (648 miles). This village is in the neighbor- 
hood of the most remote of the early Russian trading posts, which was established 
by Nalakoff in 1838, after which he and his party returned to St. Michael for the 
winter. During the winter the buildings were burned by the natives. 
In 1841 the post was reestablished and rebuilt by Deravin. In 1851 it was the 
scene of a massacre, among the victims being Lieutenant Barnard, of the British 
navy, and a member of Admiral Kollinson’s expedition in search of Sir John 
Franklin. Lieutenant Barnard had been detailed to ascend the Yukon River and 
ascertain whether the natives could give any tidings of Sir John Franklin’s party. 
Reaching Nulato, he dispatched one of the employees of the fur company and an 
Indian into the Koyukok Valley for information. The Russian, on his arrival at 
the native village, fell asleep on his sledge, and in the absence of his servant, who 
had gone to obtain water, was killed by the natives, the servant himself being 
afterwards killed. The murderers then gathered a force of about one hundred 
and started for the Russian post at Nulato, Reaching a settlement of the Nulato
-P-A-G-E-509

Indians, they heaped wood, broken canoes, paddles, and snowshoes in front of the 
entrance and smoke holes of the native houses, and then, setting them on fire, 
suffocated almost the entire population, only five or six escaping. The next morn- 
ing, swarming into the courtyard of the fort, they made an attack, killing the 
commander, also Lieutenant Barnard and others. No punishment was ever meted 
out to the murderers, and the reason of their wholesale butchery remains involved 
in mystery. 2 
This village is the site of a Roman Catholic mission, and Father Monroe, the 
priest, was at the landing to greet us. At Nulato the Yukon River, which has 
been running for 850 miles in a northern and eastern direction, turns directly 
eastward, Just above the village is the mouth of the Koyukuk River, a large 
tributary from the north. A small steamer has ascended this river some 600 miles, 
and gold has been found along its course in paying quantities. I gathered from 
the fur traders that have been in the country for many years, and also from the 
miners that have been longest in the country, their conviction that when the gold 
fields of the country are explored and more is known concerning them, the 
richest mines in all Alaska will be found along the course of this stream. Itisa 
noticeable fact that the tributaries of the Yukon flowing from the north are clear 
water, while those from the south are muddy like the main river. This is due to 
the fact that the streams from the south take their rise from the glaciers of 
southern Alaska, and also that some of them run through a region covered with 
volcanic ash, which is easily washed away and held in solution. In recent geo- 
logical times there has been an eruption of volcanic dust in southern Alaska which 
has ieorered an area of 20,000 square miles to a varying depth of from a few inches 
to 50 feet. 
On Monday, July 12, we passed, in the afternoon, the abandoned buildings of 
the old Tanana trading post, and a few miles farther on made a call at Fort 
Adams, the site of the St. James Episcopal mission. The missionaries in charge 
are Rey. and Mrs. J. L. Prevost. A pleasant call was had with the missionaries. 
Mrs. Prevost had the pleasure of having with her for a visit her mother from the 
East. ‘ 
The Tanana trading post having been removed 8 miles from its former position 
to a point on the north bank abreast of the mouth of the Tanana River, the St. 
James Episcopal mission is also to be removed to the same neighborhood, the 
waters of the Yukon having shoaled and made a landing difficult at the old sites. 
The mouth of the Tanana, 897 miles from St. Michael, bids fair to prove a central 
and permanent location in the affairs of the Yukon Valley, being midway between 
the mouth of the river on Bering Sea and the crossing of the international bound- 
ary line on the Upper Yukon. This point has been recommended to the United 
States Government by Captain Ray, U.S. A., as the best location for a military 
post. If the Territory shall be divided into two districts, this point will probably 
be the capital of thesecond. It will also probably be the northern terminus of a 
trunk line of a railway either from Cooks Inlet or Prince William Sound, the 
railroad ascending to the Sushitna River to the head waters of the Tanana and - 
down the Tanana to the Yukon. z 
On the ist of March a meteor fell near the Episcopal buildings. Though the 
night was dark, the whole heavens were lighted up with its brilliancy. Many of 
the natives were much frightened at the phenomenon. During the past winter 
Ivan, the great chief of the Tanana, died and was buried in the mission cemetery. 
His kingdom stretched from Camp Stevens to Novikakat, on the Yukon River; 
also for 500 miles up the Tanana Valley and across the portage, including the 
head waters of the Kuskokwim River. From his early manhood he had proven 
himself the friend of the Russians, and latterly of the Americans. Many years 
ago the wife of a Russian trader who had_a store in the Tanana Valley had 
incurred the enmity of some of the people, and one of their number was persuaded 
by the shamans to kill her, which he did by shooting her in her own house. 
Encouraged by the deed, arrangements were commenced for killing the trader 
also. At this juncture Ivan reached the scene and interposed to save the life of 
the trader. This so incensed the shamans that they threatened to kill him also. 
Drawing himself up to his full height of 6 feet, with flashing eyes he bade them 
defiance and saved the white man. 
The natives of this region are in transition from their own to the white man’s 
way. Old customs are losing their hold upon them, and it is doubtful whether 
any other leader will arise from among them. 
At Nuklukahyet (Mayo’s Place at the mouth of the Tanana) a miner was 
brought on board who had been found by the natives in a starving condition. He 
had been off prospecting by himself on the Koyukuk River. In running a rapid 
he lost his footing and all his provisions, saving only his gun and ax. His team
-P-A-G-E-510

of dogs were stung to death by mosquitoes. He struggled across the country for 
300 miles, his only food a moose which he had shot and on which he had lived 
eighteen days. When found he was naked, starving, and out of his mind. 
The Tanana is the largest of the tributaries of the Yukon. Taking its rise among 
the group of ice-covered mountains in southern Alaska, it flows northward, empty- 
ing into the Yukon. It is navigable for several hundred miles from its mouth. 
Gold has been found along its course. It has a-scattered native population of 
about 1,000, who are under the care of the St. James Episcopal mission. Thehead 
waters of the Tanana rise on the high table lands from which also flow the head 
waters of the Sushitna and Copper rivers into the Pacific Ocean; the Forty Mile 
Creek and White River into the Upper Yukon. While the steamer lay at the 
mouth of the Tanana, taking on wood and cleaning its boilers, we received a visit 
from the Rev. J. L. Prevost on his little steam launch, the Northern Light. This 
vessel, 40 by 25 feet in size, was built by the Union Iron Works of San Francisco, 
and equipped with a Roberts safety water tube. It is capable of carrying a wood 
supply sufficient for forty-eight hours continuous steaming, and is fitted up with 
a comfortable cabin for the missionaries. This little launch has proved of great 
service in visiting the small native settlements on the Yukon and Tanana river, 
with their smaller tributaries. Mr. Prevost has the honor of publishing the first 
newspaper ever printed in the Yukon Valley. His little paper, called the Yukon 
Press, is practically an annual, but one number being published during last year. 
This paper, with the Hskimo Bulletin, also an annual, published at Cape Prince 
of Wales, Bering Straits, by W. 'T. Lopp, the missionary, are the only papers up 
to this time that have been published in central or arctic Alaska. As the editors 
of these Alaskan papers have had but one mail a year, it is not to be expected that 
their papers should appear any oftener, 
On the afternoon of July 13 the steamer entered a section of the Yukon Valley 
known as ‘‘ Lower Rampart.” This was formed by the river in some former age 
having broken through a range of mountains. The scenery through the canyon 
was so grand and wild that but few of the passengers were willing to go to bed, 
but remained up nearly all night. 
Early in the morning of July 19 we reached the mouth of Munook Creek (1,075 
miles). At the mouth of this creek, on the south side of the Yukon River, a new 
town has been laid out and named ‘“ Rampart City.” At the time of our arrival 
the city consisted of a good log store building, two or three log huts, and half a 
dozen tents. Twenty-one men were reported at work in the mines along the creek, 
about 6 miles from the village. A mining district had been established, with Mr. 
O. C. Miller as recorder, and town lots were sold at $300 each. Nearly a month 
later I returned down the river. Lots had doubled in price, and the population 
had increased to about 200. A month later the population had increased to 1,000, 
and corner lots were selling at $200 and $300 in gold dust, and probably by this 
time it is the largest city in central Alaska. An acquaintance sank a shaft 4 feet 
square and 20 feet deep to bed rock, taking out $3,250 in gold nuggets. 
The course of the steamer after leaving Rampart City was through the canyon, 
the hills rising on both sides of the river from 500 to 2,000 feet, making interesting 
scenery. 
On July 15, at 2 o'clock a. m., we reached Fort Hamlin, a new trading post estab- 
lished by the Alaska Commercial Company; and soon after we passed out from the 
canyon into that portion of the river knownas the Yukon Flats, where it broadens 
out into a lake-like expanse 80 miles wide, filled with many islands, no hills being 
visible on either side. The flats continue for over 200 miles, at the upper end being 
situated the mining town of Circle City. In a former period, when the Rampart 
Mountains stood a barrier to the drainage westward, this great plain, comprising 
an area of 100,000 square miles, more or less, was covered with water, into which 
the Porcupine, the Pelly, the White, the Stewart, the Birch, and other streams 
poured their floods, washing down the mountains and the hills and covering the 
plain many feet deep with sediment. In places where the present streams have 
cut a channel through this sediment heaps of driftwood were found buried in 200 
feet of clay. Geological evidences show the bed of the Porcupine River 200 feet 
higher than now. [f it is true, as reported, that the bed of a great river exists 
among the mountain ravines of southern Alaska, it may be that it was the outlet 
of this inland sea. In time, through erosion or rending of the mountain barriers 
by earthquake or in some other way, an outlet was opened to the westward, and 
the released waters swept irresistibly to the sea, carrying with their angry flood 
sediment which extended the land hundreds of miles into the Bering Sea. After 
the subsidence of the waters this region became the home of the mastodon, the 
bones and tusks of which are found in large numbers. 
On July 16 we met and passed the steamer J. J. Healy on its way down the river.
-P-A-G-E-511
  EDUCATION IN ALASKA. 1639 
Among the passengers was Professor Ogilvie, of the Canadian geological survey. 
Being anxious to see the old historic Fort Yukon, of the Hudson Bay Fur Com- 
pany, and the mouth of the Porcupine River, in the neighborhood of which we 
were on the evening of the16th, I concluded to remain up allnight. At midnight 
(12.45 a. m.) I saw the sun rise in the north, like a great globe of bright, glowing, 
red-hot iron inafurnace. About 6a, m. we passed the fort, without stopping. 
A large number of natives lined the banks of the river. Besides numerous tents, 
there were several log houses, among them being a small one surmounted by a 
cross and belonging to the Episcopal mission. A mile and a half east of thestation 
we passed the site of the old Hudson Bay Fur Company’s post, now abandoned. 
Only a clear space and a few foundations mark the place once occupied by the 
post. A good-sized cemetery occupies a dry mound back of the ruins, and is a 
touching reminder of the days when this far-off wilderness spot under the Arctic 
Circle was the center of life and civilization, with its loves and hates, hopes and 
fears, strifes and ambitions. 
Here the all-powerful Hudson Bay Fur Company met and contended with the 
equally powerful Russian-American Fur Company, backed by their respective 
Governments. 
Plucking the brilliant flowers of the fire plant as a souvenir for a friend in New 
York City, who was born here when her father ruled as the chief factor of the 
company, I watched the receding spot until a turn in the river hid it from sight. 
As yesterday, the scenery continued through an expanse of river, widening out 
into a lake, filled with many islands, covered with white pine, aspen, and willows, 
and sand bars so recently out of the water as to be bare ofall vegetation. 
We had expected to be in Circle City during the night of July 18, but green fire- 
wood, swift current, low stage of water, and worn-out boiler flues all conspired 
to detain us, so that morning found us still 20 miles away. The morning dawned 
with a cold rain and great discomfort among the passengers. At 10 o’clock we 
stopped to take on wood. Mr. R. Wilson, who is in charge of the wood yard for 
steamers, at the same time provides fresh vegetables. As soon asa sufficient num- 
ber of trees are cut down to let the sunlight reach the ground, he loosens the soil 
between the stumps and roots with a pickax and sows turnips, rutabagas, and 
cabbage. Last season, on a quarter of an acre of that uncleared ground between 
stumps, he raised and sold 3,000 pounds of turnips at 15 cents per pound, besides 
large quantities of cabbages and rutabagas. The rutabaga seed sown the last of 
May, this season, now (in less than two months) have a spread of leaves 2 feet 
across. 
~ At 1p. m. we reached Circle City. Mr. Kjellman, who had preceded me by 
another boat, met me at the landing; he had been able to make an overland trip 
to the mines tributary to the city and had ascertained that the whole region was 
admirably adapted for the support of reindeer and for the successful running of 
reindeer expresses and freight lines. Circle City is the largest collection of well- 
built log cabins that I have seen; at leastin a great many years. Four large store 
and ware houses are made of corrugated galvanized iron, The opera and dance 
houses and two or three of the more pretentious residences are of hewn logs. Tho 
log residence of the North American Transportation and Trading Company is said 
to have cost $20,000, and that of Mr. Jack McQueston $15,000. The great majority 
of the buildings are small, one-story cabins built of logs, the spaces between the 
logs being filled with moss. The roofs are made with poles covered with moss, 
on which is placed a foot of dirt. A year ago the place had a population of 2,000; 
to-day there are about 50, and the majority of them are expecting to leave on our 
boat. ; 
Circle City was founded in the fall of 1894, and named because of its nearnessto 
the Arctic Circle. It is the distributing point for the rich gold placer mines of 
Birch Creek, which is a river 6 miles east of Circle City and runs a distance of 
between 200 and 300 miles in a general course parallel with the Yukon River. 
Among the interesting tributaries of Birch Creek is ‘‘ Preachers Creek,” so named 
because first explored by a missionary in search of fossils, which abound in some 
portions of the Yukon flats. Gold was first found on Birch Creek in 1898. Since 
then prospecting has been going on so vigorously that the creek, with its many 
tributaries, has been definitely proven to be very rich in mineral deposits. 
Although the rush this present season is to the more recently discovered mines on 
the Klondike River, yet 400 miners remain at work on Birch Creek, and doubtless 
in a year or two the now almost depopulated Circle City will be again peopled. 
During last winter a successful public school was kept at this place by Miss A. 
Fulcomer, but in the spring, when the miners left for the Klondike, they were 
accompanied by their families and children and the school was broken up. 
Leaving Circle City at 9 o’clock in the evening, we soon met the steamer Alice on
-P-A-G-E-512

her way down the river. Just above Circle City the river leaves the flats and is 
again bordered on both sides by abrupt hills of sand and limestone with veins of 
granite and crystalline gneiss, which add to the pleasure of the traveler. ~ 
During the night we passed a small Indian settlement known as ‘‘ Charley’s 
Village,” 22 miles from Circle City. This community has received the gospel from 
the English missionaries, who have been in this region since 1858. 
On the evening of July 19 the monotony of the trip was relieved by the discovery 
on the river bank of a moose doe and her fawn. At once arose the greatest excite- 
ment on the steamer—a score of men rushing for their rifles, and a fusilade of shots 
commenced, both animals being killed. Thesteamer was landed, and men, women, 
and children ran into the bushes to see the game, which was brought on board. 
In the afternoon of July 20 we passed the small stern-wheel steamer, the Koyu- 
kuk, bound for the Klondike mines. The next morning, in trying to get at some 
driftwood for fuel, the steamer ran aground, where we remained until about 6 
p. m., when we were again afloat. 
On July 22 the steamer stopped to ‘‘ wood up” opposite a remarkable headland, 
showing a beautiful geological formation of folded rock, Frequently during the 
day masses of loose rock came-rumbling down the face of the cliff into the water. 
At noon on the 234 we passed two remarkable rocks, known as ‘‘ The Oid Man” 
and ‘¢The Old Woman.” Upon the top of one of these shaft-like rocks one of the 
old fort traders has requested to be buried; an appropriate resting place for the 
sole pioneer white man in that region. At 6.30 p.m. we were startled by the cry 
of “A manoverboard.” The accident befell one of the deck hands, who had become 
insane, and the untrained crew were so long getting a boat into the water that the 
man drowned. The body was not recovered. At7 p.m. we passed the mouth of 
Coal Creek, and soon after sighted on the west shore the wrecked hull of the 
steamer Arctic. She was frozen up in the ice during the previous winter, and in 
order to loosen her in the ice this spring giant powder was used, with the result of 
blowing her bottom out. Boiler and engines were removed, to be placed inanother 
boat. Coal Creek enters the Yukon from the east about 7 miles from Forty Mile 
Creek and is navigable for a few miles. It flows through a limestone formation. 
Extensive beds of lignite coal are reported in the neighborhood. 
About 9 p.m. Fort Cudahy, at the mouth of Forty Mile Creek, was reached. 
Adjoining this is a trading post of the North American Transportation and Trad- 
ing Company. Near by is Fort Constantine, a stockade post occupied by the Cana- 
dian mounted police, Captain Constantine in charge. On the opposite, south side 
of the mouth of Forty Mile Creek is the village of Forty Mile, which has grown up 
around the’old trading station of Jack McQueston. Down Forty Mile Creek is 
Buxton, a Church of England mission station, which was established in 1887. 
We have now reached the western limit of the wonderful missions of the Church 
Missionary Society of England in northwest Canada. Commenced in 1822 by the 
Rev. John West, who settled at a Hudson Bay fur-trading station near Lake Win- 
nipeg, they have extended until now they embrace nearly all the Indian tribes 
extending from the north boundary of the United States to the Arctic Ocean and 
from Labrador to the Alaskan line. Through all this wide region the gospel of 
Christ has been preached in eleven different languages, and thousands upon thou- 
sands of Indians have felt the transforming power of His life in their works and 
lives. This region belongs to the diocese of Selkirk, and was created in 1890 by 
the division of the diocese of Mackenzie River. The Rev. Dr. W.C. Bompas, who 
entered the mission work in 1865 and was consecrated bishop of the diocese of 
Mackenzie River in 1874, in the division took the bishopric of Selkirk. The diocese 
of Selkirk has but three or four central stations, Rampart House, on the Porcu- 
pine River, being one of them. This station was established in 1882, but owing to 
the decrease of the fur trade and consequent removal of the trading store and fur- 
ther discovery of gold on the Yukon River, nearly all the natives have left, andit 
is probable that the station will be discontinued at an early day. Buxton, on the 
Yukon River at the mouth of Forty Mile Creek, was established in 1887. Being in 
the center of the newly discovered gold diggings, it is wel! located to reach the 
native population. Selkirk was located in 1892 and Dawson in 1897.

No more devoted, self-sacrificing men and women are to be found in the terri-

of Kane, Hays, Hall, Franklin, Kellett, Ross, Greely, Peary, Nansen, and many 
others, who in the cause of science spend one, two, and three years in the arctic 
regions; but few stop to think of and to honor the men and women who, for the 
sake of Christ and precious souls, are not merely traveling for a few months, but 
are toiling year after year amid the rigors and privations and loneliness and long 
months of continuous darkness of the arctic winters. Let the church be true to 
herself and honor such consecrated sons and daughters as Dr. and Mrs. Marsh at 
Point Barrow; Mr. and Mrs. Lopp at Bering Straits; Mr. and Mrs. Gambell at 
St. Lawrence Island; Mr. and Mrs. Brevig, of Port Clarence, the Swedish mis- 
sionaries at Unalaklik and Golovin Bay; Messrs. Chapman and Prevost and their 
devoted wives on the Yukon River, with Bishop Bompas and his assistants in the 
Northwest Territory. 
Forty Mile Creek is so named because it is 40 miles from the old Hudson Bay 
Fur Company’s trading post at Fort Reliance. It is about 250 miles long and has 
many tributaries, allof which carry free gold, the discovery of which has attracted 
the attention of the world to the upper Yukon region. The Forty Mile Creek 
drains the mountainous region between the valleys of the Yukon and Tanana. 
Near Forty Mile is Miller Creek, which has proven veryrich in gold. For two or 
three years Forty Mile and Fort Cudahy were typical mining towns, with saloons 
and gambling and dance halls in abundance. In 1894 rich discoveries were made 
on Birch Creek, and Forty Mile was deserted for Circle City, which after two and 
a half years of fevered existence has been in turn deserted for the new mines on 
the Klondike. While the mines tributary to Fort Cudahy and Forty Mile are on 
the American side, the villages themselves are on the Canadian side of the inter- 
national boundary line, 
Wishing to visit the Church of England missions at Buxton, on Saturday, July 
24, I made two attempts to cross Forty Mile Creek in a rowboat, but was unable 
to accomplish it, owing to the strong current. At Fort Cudahy I found in con- 
nection with the North American Transportation and Trading Company’s station 
an excellent garden, in which were growing peas, beans, lettuce, turnips, ruta- 
bagas, beets, potatoes, celery, and parsnips. 
About 5 p. m. the steamer swung out from her landing for Dawson, which 
place we reached the following morning, July 25, at 6 o’clock. Nearly the entire 
population seemed to be at the landing, either to greet friends or from curiosity 
to witness the landing of newcomers. Capt. John J. Healy, manager of the 
North American Trading and Transportation Company, was on hand to extend 
to me the hospitality of his home during my stay. Although it was Sunday, the 
two sawmills were running day and night; every kind of business, especially 
house building, was in full blast. Four thousand people were living in tents, and 
an arctic winter approaching. 
The temperature for January, 1896, was 474° below zero, during the winter the 
lowest point being 77° below zero. Dawson is 50 miles from Fort Cudahy, on the 
north of the Yukon and southwest bank of the Klondike River. It is 6 miles 
above the site of the old Hudson Bay Fur Company's post of Fort Reliance. The 
town is situated in an undrained swamp, and much sickness prevails among the 
population. The city is about eight months old and is regularly laid out in streets 
and squares. Lots fronting on the river are selling for $7,000 cash in gold; back 
of the stream, from $1,000 to $3,000. Lumber is $150 per thousand feet at the 
mill and $300 a thousand when it reaches the mines. Some of the early lumber 
sawed by hand cost the miners at the rate of $750 per thousand feet. Salmon and 
moose were $50 per pound; hay, $125 per ton, and none to be had; wages, $10 to 
$12 per day, with mechanics at $15; ice, $1 per pound; flour at $12 per hundred- 
weight; a team of horses and driver, $50 per day. The Canadian Government 
was erecting comfortable headquarters for the mounted police, and large log 
warehouses were in process of construction for the two commercial companies. 
The banks of the river were lined with scows and flatboats, in which the popula- 
tion had floated down the river; others of these boats had been covered with can- 
vas and turned into houses. At half past 2 in the afternoon Rey. Mr. Bowen, of 
the Church of England, held a service, which I missed, not having been able to 
ascertain the hour at which it was to be held. 
The mines are from 12 to 25 miles up the Klondike River from Dawson. The 
claims are 300 or 400 feet wide up and down the stream and across the flats. 
These claims were being held at $100,000 to $1,000,000 each. Quarter interests in 
these claims were selling at $50,000 each. The claims on the Klondike and its 
tributaries were all taken up long before my arrival, and weeks before the tidings 
of their value reached the distant world. Would-be miners, however, can find in 
the valleys of the Stewart, Pelly, and other streams of the Northwest Territory, 
in the valley of the Yukon and all its tributaries and their innumerable creeks

we 
and brooks gold fields of greater or less richness; indeed, the area of the gold field 
practically covers four-fifths of the entire area of Alaska, and will furnish claims 
for many years to come. The newcomer usually pitches a tent, and, when he 
secures employment or a claim, erects a small one-story log cabin for shelter. 
Moss is filled in between the logs, and in winter snow is piled up over the house, 
making it very comfortable. Ice is usually melted in winter for drinking water, 
or cakes of ice are drawn to the house and piled outside of the door to be brought 
in, as occasion demands, and melted into water. 
At 7 o’clock p. m., July 26, having bid adieu to friends and acquaintances at 
Dawson City, our steamer swung loose from the landing and was soon racing 
down the river with a swift current, reaching Fort Cudahy at 10 o’clock, having 
made in three hours down stream a distance that required fourteen hours to make 
on the way up. 
The following day we reached Circle City, having traveled in twenty-four hours 
what took us seven days to go up, but our hopes were soon to be blighted. Shortly 
after leaving Circle City our steamer was caught by the current and swung upon 
asand bar, where we lay nineteen days. 
On the 13th of August, about 1 p. m., the cry of “Steamboat!” was heard, and 
soon after the J. J. Healy was made out on her return down the river, and at 6 
p. m., after our detention of nineteen days, the passengers were transferred from 
the Weare to the Healy, upon which we continued our journey to St. Michael. 
On the evening of August 20 the steamer Hamilton was met coming up the river. 
Being the first steamer to carry a search-light, it created much interest and some 
consternation among the natives. The two steamers were tied up together for 
the night. On the incoming steamer was the first rush of miners that had been 
able to start from the outside after the tidings had reached them. It was crowded 
with gold seekers and adventurers, among them being ex-Governor McGraw, of 
the State of Washington; alsomany special correspondents of newspapers, includ- 
ing the New York World and Herald, the San Francisco Chronicle, Examiner, 
and Call; also the Post-Intelligencer and other Seattle papers. A supply of 
papers was secured and greatly appreciated after being over two months without 
any news from the outside world, 
On the 30th of August the revenue cutter Bear reached St. Michael, and through 
the courtesy of Captain Tuttle I was permitted to move my headquarters to that 
ship. On the 16th we sailed for a visit to Teller Reindeer Station, Cape Prince of 
Wales, and the new purchase station at St. Lawrence Bay, reaching Teller Rein- 
deer Station September 18. An inspection of the station was made. Four fami- 
lies of Lapp herders and teachers whose time had expired were taken on board 
the Bear for transportation to Puget Sound en route to their homes in Lapland. 
Five young Eskimo girls and one boy were also received on board for transporta- 
tion to Puget Sound on their way to the Indian school at Carlisle, Pa. On the 
morning of the 20th the ship sailed for St. Lawrence Bay, Siberia, reaching there 
on the morning of the 2ist. Mr. John W. Kelly, in charge of the station, and his 
assistants (Messrs. Siem and St. Leger) were found in good health. The new 
building was about completed, and 200 head of deer had already been secured 
toward the herd which is to be transported to Alaska next season. Sailing the 
same evening and making a short call at King Island, St. Michael was reached on 
the 23d. Changing my quarters from the cutter Bear to the cutter Corwin, I was 
given a passage by Captain Herring to San Francisco. On September 26 the 
Corwin made a landing at St. Lawrence Island, and the captain very kindly took 
on board the teachers, Mr. and Mrs. V. C. Gambell, Mrs. Gambell needing to 
return to the States on account of ill health. On the 30th we reached Dutch Har- 
bor, where a stay of two or three days was made for coaling ship. Sailing from 
Dutch Harbor October 3, we reached San Francisco on the 13th and Washington 
November 1, thus completing a trip of 21,736 miles. 
There are two general ways of reaching the mines in the Yukon and Klondike. 
The way involving the least hardship is by the ocean and from the Pacific coast to 
St. pions by ocean steamer, from thence up the Yukon River by river steamer 
to the mines,

The following stern-wheel steamers were running on the river this summer: 
Belonging to the North American Trading and Transportation Company were the 
P. B. Weare, J. J. Healy, and O. H. Hamilton; belonging to the Alaska Commer- 
cial Company were the Alice, Yukon, a barge Marguerite, the steam launch Beaver, 
and New Racket, owned by A. Harper; the Koukuk, by G. C. Bettles; the St. 
Michael, by the Roman Catholic mission; the Northern Light, by the American 
Episcopal mission, and the Explore, by the Russian Catholic mission. The fare 
from Seattle to Juneau during the summer ranges from $150 to $300 per passenger. 
The drawback to this route consists in the fact that the miner does not reach the 
mines until the short arctic summer is half gone. The harbor at St. Michael does 
not open until from the middle of June to the middle of July, and it is impossible 
for ocean vessels to reach St. Michael on account of the ice before the middle of 
June at the earliest, and from the ist of July to the 1st of August to the mines, 
according to the ice conditions on the coast. The more difficult and popular route 
is that by way of southeast Alaska; a comfortable vessel from Puget Sound to the 
northern end of Lynn Canal or Chilkoot Inlet, or an ocean steamer to Dyea and 
Skagway, rival towns 6 miles apart on the head waters of Chilkoot Inlet in south- 
eastern Alaska. 
Those starting from Skagway take what is known as the White Pass, and those 
from Dyea the Chilkoot Pass. With the present conditions of those passes, the 
Chilkoot Pass is probably the preferable, but both of them require the undergoing 
of considerable hardship. The Chilkoot and White passes involve some 380 or 40 
miles’ climb from the mountains on foot, which brings one to the lakes at the 
head waters of the Yukon River, where boats, barges, and rafts are constructed 
upon which the traveler floats down to the mines. To the westward of the Chil- 
koot Pass is what is known as the Dalton Trail. This pass crosses the mountains 
at a much lower elevation than either of the others and involves a trip on foot or 
horseback of 250 miles. This is the trail used for driving over to the Yukon River 
beef, cattle, and sheep. Itis to the eastward of Chilkoot Pass, commencing either 
at Fort Wrangell and ascending the Stikine River to Telegraph Creek, thence 
overland by way of Lake Teslin, or starting from Juneau and going by the Taku 
Inlet and River to Lake Teslin, and passing down the waters of the same to the 
Yukon. At present neither of these routes is sufficiently open to make them 
feasible, as a number of miners found to their great loss during the past summer.

  RELIEF FOR SUFFERING MINERS. 
During the summer just passed the water in the Yukon River reached a very 
low stage, preventing the usual steamer transportation along the mining towns 
on the upper courses of that river. Large quantities of provisions were landed by 
the ocean steamers at St. Michael, but owing to the inability of the river steamers 
to ascend the river these supplies could not be distributed to the points where 
they were needed; consequently as the close of navigation approached it was found 
that the miners were facing the long arctic winter without sufficient supplies of 
food. The destitution was so great that a cail was made upon the Government 
to organize relief. Many plans were suggested to theGovernment. After weigh- 
ing these plans it was found that the only possible solution was to take the rein- 
deer trained to harness that were in the neighborhood of St. Michael and with 
them freight provisions to the settlements on the Yukon. Hence on the 22d of 
September you sent to William A, Kjellmann, superintendent of the Government 
herds in Alaska, the following telegram: 
“By direction of the Secretary of the Interior, Mr. Kjellmann will assemble at 
once all of the available reindeer trained for harness, teamsters, and sleds, and 
report at St. Michael to Colonel Randall to transport supplies to Dawson City if 
necessary. Obtain all deer trained to harness that can be spared from Cape Prince 
of Wales, Golovin Bay, and Cape Nome, together with apprentices trained as 
teamsters and willing to go. Promise wages to all teamsters. Deer borrowed 
from other stations will be replaced. Also consult the United States commissioner 
at St, Michael. 
“W. 'T. Harris, Commissioner.” 
Upon receiving the dispatch, which was carried by way of ship to St. Michael, 
Mr. Kjellmann at once secured a boat and crew of Eskimos, which he sent with a 
copy of the dispatch to Dr, A. N. Kittilsen, in charge at the Teller Reindeer Sta- 
tion. Dr. Kittilsen was directed to drive the herd as soon as possible to the new 
station established on the Unalaklik River, and upon his arrival there placed him- 
self in communication with Lieut. Col. G. M. Randall, U. S. A., commanding 
United States military post at St. Michael. Mr. Kjellmann also ordered the 
building of a sufficient number of sleds, to be ready upon the arrival of the deer 
trained to harness. These deer, operated by the War Department from St. 
Michael, will be able to relieve the destitution as far up the river as Rampart 
City (1,075 miles from St. Michael by the mouth of the river).

These arrangements were no sooner consummated than tidings came from the 
Arctic coast of Alaska that eight whaling vessels, carrying crews aggregating 
about 400 men, had been unexpectedly caught in the ice and the men were in 
danger of starvation. Many plans were proposed for a relief expedition, but, as in 
the former case, it was found that no plan was practicable that was not based 
upon the use of the reindeer. Accordingly the Government, on the 16th of 
November, issued orders for the revenue cutter Bear to proceed north until stopped 
by ice, then to make a determined effort to send Lieut. D. H. Jarvis and two or 
three men over the ice to the mainland. Having effected a landing, the party are 
to proceed to Cape Prince of Wales, secure the services of W. T. Lopp, a Congre- 
gational missionary, borrow his reindeer herd and also the herd belonging toa 
native Eskimo by the name of Antisarlook, and with these two herds proceed 
overland 500 or 600 miles in December and January to Point Barrow, or until the 
whalers are found and relief afforded. 
As the season advanced the accounts of the shortage of food in the Yukon Val- 
ley became more and more alarming, and on the 18th of December Congress voted 
to be expended, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, the sum of 
$200,000, to be used for the taking of relief into the region of the Upper Yukon 
Valley. As the reindeer in the neighborhood of St. Michael can not be reached at 
this season of the year on account of ice, and fresh importations can not be made 
from Siberia on the same account, it is planned to send to Lapland, procure from 
500 to 600 reindeer trained to harness and 50 or 60 experienced drivers, transport 
them across the Atlantic to New York, thence across the continent to Seattle, and 
from Seattle to Dyea, near the Chilkoot Pass in southeast Alaska. At this point 
arrangements will be made by means of these trained deer to carry provisions to 
the mining camps in the Upper Yukon Valley. 
Thus when an exigency arose in which hundreds of men were threatened with 
starvation it was found that the reindeer furnished the only reasonable plan for 
the relief of the miners. The reindeer are a necessity for the development of the 
new mines and the supply of sufficient food for the miners. The more rapidly 
domestic reindeer can be introduced into that country the more rapidly new sec- 
tions can be visited and developed. 
In conclusion,I desire to acknowledge the many courtesies received from the 
honorable Secretary of the Treasury; Capt. C. F. Shoemaker, chief of Revenue- 
Cutter Service; Capt. Francis Tuttle, commanding cutter Bear; Capt. W. J. Her- 
ring, commanding the Corwin, together with officers and crews of both vessels; 
also the North American Commercial Company, their agents in Alaska, and Capt. 
J. C. Barr, commanding the river steamer J. J. Kelly, and Captain Kidtlson, 
commanding the steamer Portland.

CHAPTER XXXVI. 
INSTITUTIONS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. ° 
STATISTICAL REVIEW OF HIGHER EDUCATION, 1896-97, 
* The scholastic year 1896-97 has witnessed a decrease in the attendance of 
students at a large number of institutions for higher education, as well as a 
decrease in the number of such institutions. This office has been notified during 
the year of the suspension of the following-named institutions: Little Rock Uni- 
versity, Little Rock, Ark.; Pierce Christian College, College City, Cal.; San Joa- 
quin Valley College, Woodbridge, Cal.; Hartsville College, Hartsville, Ind.; 
Northwestern Christian College, Excelsior, Minn.; Ozark College, Greenfield, 
Mo.; Ashland University, Ashland, Ohio; Monongahela College, Jefferson, Pa.; 
St. James College, Vancouver, Wash.; Jones College for Young Ladies, Gadsden, 
Ala.; Winchester Female College, Winchester, Ky., and Wesleyan Female Insti- 
tute, Staunton, Va. A further decrease in the list of institutions for higher edu- 
cation was caused by the transfer to the list of secondary schools of four insti- 
tutions. Also, St. Mary’s College, Oakland, Cal.; Calvin College, Cleveland, Ohio, 
and Redfield College, Redfield, 8. Dak., have not been heard from for several 
years, and therefore are not included in the list of colleges. 
One of the most discouraging features in our system of higher education is the 
lack of any definite, or, in fact, in a large number of States, the lack of any 
requirements or conditions exacted of institutions when they are chartered and 
authorized to confer degrees. This condition of affairs is largely, if not entirely, 
responsible for the large number of weak so-called colleges and universities scat- 
tered throughout our country, institutions that are no better than high schools, 
and in a large number of cases do not furnish as good an education as may be 
obtained in good secondary schools. Nevertheless, these institutions are char- 
tered and granted authority to confer all degrees usually granted by universities 
and colleges in the United States. The chartering of such institutions has been 
rendered impossible in the States of New York and Pennsylvania, and the sub- 
ject of restricting to well-equipped institutions the authority to confer degrees is 
being agitated in several other States. That such action is desirable, if not abso- 
lutely necessary, may be seen from the fact, as stated in the report of the State 
superintendent of public instruction of Pennsylvania for 1896, that more than 120 
institutions in that State have been empowered to confer degrees. 
Students.—The total number of students reported in the collegiate, graduate, 
and professional departments of institutions for higher education and in profes- 
sional schools for the year 1896-97 is 140,183, of which number 42,999 were enrolled. 
as professional students pursuing studies in law, medicine, and theology, leaving 
97,184 students reported as pursuing what are generally known as liberal studies. 
This is a decrease of 255 students from the number reported in the preceding year, 
the loss being in the institutions classed as universities and colleges for men and 
for both sexes. An examination of Table 2 of this chapter shows that the num- 
ber of undergraduate and graduate students reported by public institutions is 
27,654, being an increase of 1,358 students, thus proving that the decrease was in 
the institutions not under the control of the State or municipality. 
Table 3 gives the number of collegiate and graduate students from the several 
States and Territories in universities and colleges for men and for both sexes, col- 
leges for women, Division A, and in schools of technology, the estimated popu- 
lation of each State, and the number of people to each college student. In this 
compilation the colleges for women, Division B (Table 39), are not included, 
owing to the fact that in a large number of these institutions the students are not 
classified in such manner as to enable one to separate the primary and preparatory 
1647

nee

from the collegiate students, while in other cases the residence of students is not 
given in the catalogues of the institutions. The drawing power of the institu- 
: tions of the several States, as shown by the number and proportion of students 
drawn from the various sections of the country, is shown in Tables 4, 5, and 6. 
From Table 6 it is seen that 803 students from foreign countries are receiving col- 
legiate and graduate instruction in the United States. 
The number of students who remain at ae advanced studies after 
haying completed courses of study leading to a bachelor’s degree is constantly 
increasing. The total number of such students reported in 1896-97 by all classes 
of institutions is 4,919, of which number 1,413 were women. These numbers do 
not include the students who remain at college for the purpose of pursuing pro- 
fessional studies in law, medicine, theology, etc. The following tabular statement 
gives the number of resident graduate students in the several departments of some 
of the principal universities and colleges of the country:

According to the report of President Gilman of Johns Hopkins University for 
the year 1896-97, 2,103 persons have pursued graduate studies at that institution 
since its establishment, of which number 436 have been given the degree of Doctor 
of Philosophy.

The following diagrams, based on figures in the Handbook of Graduate Courses 
for 1897-98, published by the Federation of Graduate Clubs, show the popularity 
of the several branches of study among graduate students. The statistics were 
collected from 24 of the leading institutions of the country, and should therefore 
be fairly representative of graduate work. There are included in the investiga- 
tion 3,204 students, divided among the various branches of study as follows: 
Philosophy and Ethics, 519. 
History, Politics. Law, 488. 
English, 423. 
        
    
        Classics, 379. 
Economics, Sociology. Anthropology, 377. 
Psychology, Pedagogy. 298.    
Biology, 271. 
          
  Mathematics, 247. 
Chemistry, 208. 
    
   
  Romance Languages, 196. 
Physics, 189. 
Geology, Geography, 143.      
    
   
       
  Indo-Iranian and Comparative Philology, 138. 
Semitics, 129. 
Astronomy, 51. 
Fine Arts and History of Art, 37. 
Grouping the above subjects under five general headings, it is found that the 
groups were chosen by the students in the following proportion: 
Language and Literature Studies. 35.4 per cent. 
Historical and Social Sciences. 20.6 per cent. 
Philosophical (ethics, psychology, education). nen 1K Her cent, 
Natural Sciences. 14.2 per cent. 
Mathematical Sciences. 11 per cont. 
Courses of study.—A large number of institutions for higher education maintain 
professional, technical, and special courses of study in additicn to the usual studies 
required in an undergraduate course. In some cases these studies may becounted 
toward fulfilling the requirements for one of the more common degrees, while in 
other cases special degrees are conferred on the completion of suchcourses. Table 
41 gives the courses maintained by the universities and colleges for men and for 
both sexes, and Table 42 gives the courses maintained by schools of technology. 
These tables show that instruction in agriculture is given by 53 institutions, archi- 
tecture by 16, art by 175, business or commercial courses by 216, civil engineering 
by 92, domestic science by 34, dentistry by 22, electrical engineering by 70, law by 
78, mechanical engineering by 73, mining engineering by 83, medicine by 57, mili- 
tary science or tactics by 104, music by 828, pedagogy by 211, pharmacy by 30, 
sanitary engineering by 12, theology by 90, and veterinary science by 27. Besides 
the courses included in Tables 41 and 42, it is found that instruction in naval 
architecture and marine engineering is given by the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, the University of Michigan, and Cornell University, and instruction

Preparation of freshmen.—Tables 18, 21, and 32 show the number and propor- 
tion of freshmen prepared by the different kinds or institutions for secondary 
instruction as reported by a number of institutions for higher education. The 
results obtained from the statistics of the three classes of institutions reporting

  Degrees.—The number of degrees, excluding degrees in law, medicine, theology, 
dentistry, pharmacy, and veterinary medicine, conferred in 1896-97 by institu- 
tions for higher education may be found in Tables 14, 15, 16, 22, 27, 83, and 84. 
According to the reports received there were conferred 315 Ph. D. degrees, of 
which number 285 were conferred on examination and 30 were conferred as hon- 
orary degrees. In view of the efforts that are now being made to prevent the 
conferring of the Ph. D. degree except upon examination after a certain time 
spent in graduate work, it may be interesting to state that nearly all of the hon- 
orary Ph. D. degrees conferred in 1897 were granted by institutions doing very 
little, if any, graduate work. The following resolutions adopted by the Conyven- 
tion of the Federation of Graduate Clubs, December 29, 1896, clearly indicate the 
sentiments of graduate students concerning the conferring of honorary degrees: 
“Resolved, That it is the sense of this convention— 
“1, That it is inexpedient for any institution to give the same degrees honoris 
causa as it grants in regular course on examination. 
“2. That in every case the reasons for bestowing an honorary degree should be 
openly avowed and should be stated in the programme of the commencement 
exercises and in the annual catalogue. 
“3, That bachelor degrees are inappropriate as honorary degrees or ex gratia, 
and should be made to signify always the completion of a recognized grade of 
undergraduate work in their respective departments. 
“4, That the master’s degree should never be granted except for resident 
graduate study of at least one year’s duration, tested by adequate examination. 
“5. That the minimum requirements for the degree of doctor of philosophy 
should be as follows: 
‘a, The previous attainment of a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent. 
“b, The completion of at least two years of resident graduate study; not more 
a one year, however, to be required in residence at the institution conferring 
the degree. 
“e, Adequate examination and a thesis embodying the results of original 
research. Such thesis should bear the written acceptance of the professor or 
department in charge of the major subject, and should be accompanied by a short 
biography of the candidate. 
‘*6, That the degrees of Ph. D., Se. D., M. D., and Pd. D. should never be given 
honoris causa nor in absentia. L. H. D., 8. T. D., D. D., LL. D., D.C. L., and 
Mus. D. are recognized as honorary degrees.” 
The tables concerning degrees show that there were conferred 11,405 bachelor 
degrees in course, excluding professional degrees, of which number 7,999 were 
conferred on men and 3,406 on women. Of the total number, 6,233, or more than 
one-half, were A, B. degrees.
-P-A-G-E-523
INSTITUTIONS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. 1651 
The number of honorary degrees reported as having been conferred in 1896-97 is 
791, of which number 590 were doctorates. The 791 degrees were divided among 
23 different designations, 7 of which were represented by but 1 degree, 2 by 2 
degrees, 3 by 3 degrees, 2 by 5 degrees, 1 by 7 degrees, 1 by 10 degrees, 1 by 13 
degrees, 1 by 14 degrees, 1 by 15 degrees, 1 by 30 degrees, 1 by 163 degrees, 1 by 
186 degrees, and 1 (D. D.) by 323 degrees. 
Property.—The total amount of money invested in institutions for higher educa- 
tion, as reported by the institutions, is $295,816,887, of which $128,191,974 consists 
of interest-bearing funds, while the remainder is the value of the grounds, build- 
ings, and equipment used for instruction and research. Of the total amount of 
endowment funds, 51.7 per cent is held by the institutions of the North Atlantic 
Division. 
The past few years have witnessed the expenditure of large sums of money for 
buildings by a number of the universities and colleges of the country. Extraor- 
dinary expenditures for such purposes were caused by the removal to new sites of 
Columbia University, New York University, and Barnard College, New York 
City, and the erection of dormitories by the University of Pennsylvania, 
The University of California is now making preparations for extensive building 
operations and has invited the cooperation of the architects and artists of every 
land and clime in the preparation of a plan for an ideal home of education. The 
purpose is to secure a plan to which all the buildings that may be needed in the 
future shall conform, All the buildings that have been constructed up to the 
present time are to be ignored and the grounds are to be treated as a blank space, 
to be filled with a single beautiful and harmonious picture. There are to be at 
least twenty-eight buildings. About $5,000,000 has already been pledged for a 
beginning, and such a general desire to contribute has been manifested that it is 
thought that all funds required will be forthcoming as fast as the work can be 
carried on. 
Income.—The total income reported by the institutions for higher education for 
the year 1896-97 was $25,608,446, of which amount $9,585,772, or 87.4 per cent, was 
derived from tuition fees, The receipts from endowment funds were $6,191,204, 
being an income of 4.8 per cent on the amount invested. The amount appropri- 
ated by the several States and municipalities to these institutions was $3,565,529, 
and the General Government appropriated $2,444,984, 
Benefactions.—The amount of gifts and bequests received during the year was 
$8,390,938. Of this amount, $4,141,601, or almost one-half, was given to the insti- 
tutions located in the North Atlantic Division. 
The summarized and detailed statistics concerning the institutions for higher 
education are given in the following pages.

  CHAPTER XXXVII. 
AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES.! 
CHANGES IN THE COURSE OR IN THE METHODS OF INSTRUCTION (FROM PRESIDENTS’ 
REPORTS). 
Alabama Polytechnic Institute.—In the junior year students are permitted to elect 
any one of the following degree courses of study: Chemistry and agriculture, mechan- 
ical and civil engineering, electrical and mechanical engineering, or general course, 
including the Latin, French, and German languages, and pharmacy. 
Arkansas Industrial University.—Mineralogy has been grouped with geology, and 
the two madea separate department with a full professor. Civil and electrical engi- 
neering have each been made independent departments. The legislature has made 
appropriations for enlarging the equipment in mechanical, electrical, and civil engi- 
neering, and horticulture; also for the equipment and maintenance of a department 
of art, to be conducted with special reference to instruction in the practical branches 
of art as applied to the useful industries. 
Colorado State Agricultural College.—During the year covered by this report (1896-97) 
all the regular courses of instruction have been strengthened by the addition of 
another year’s work. ‘The change was found necessary in order the better to prepare 
students for the technical and scientific courses, for which the college makes provi- 
sion. The scholastic standing of a graduate of the college at the present time is 
almost midway between that of a graduate of one of our best high schools and that 
of a graduate of one of our best universities. Itis the purpose of the college manage- 
ment to maintain this standard. Efforts will be put forth to improve our methods of 
instruction and to make more efficient than ever before the literary, scientific, and 
technical work already provided for. Of course it must be understood that in fix- 
ing the standard of the college its work is widely differentiated from that both of 
the high school and the university. 
Delaware Colleye.—The system of departmental libraries referred to in a former 
report has been maintained and a large well-lighted reading room established. 
The reading room contains a valuable collection of journals and periodicals and ref- 
erence books upon the subjects of history, political and economic science, English 
language and literature, and science proper. These additional facilities, together 
with the increase in teaching force gained by a redistribution of work, have greatly 
enlarged our instruction in English and economics. Special attention has been 
given to the winter course of thirteen weeks in agriculture, with gratifying results. 
University of Idaho.—A ten weeks’ course of instruction in dairying and another 
of ten weeks in domestic science have been added. 
University of Illinois.—A school of law has been established and a school of library 
economy. 
Purdue University.— We have greatly enlarged our courses in railway engineering. 
The number of students has increased, but it is our settled policy to use our efforts 
in the line of improving the quality of our work rather than in the line of increas- 
ing our attendance. More attention. has been and will be paid to post-graduate 
work. Itis worthy of note that we have enrolled 50 post-graduate students during 
the present year. Beginning with the next school year the degrees of bachelor of 
civil, of electrical, and of mechanical engineering will be abolished and we shall 
substitute in their places bachelor of science in civil engineering, etc. 
Towa State College for agriculture and the mechanic arts.—An entire year has been 
added to the courses of study, excepting those of agriculture and veterinary medi- 
cine.

1758 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Kansas State Agricultural College.—On the whole the past year has been the most 
successful in the history of the college. A new board of regents has undertaken a 
reorganization of the college along lines yet to be dev’ eloped, but especially foster- 
ing sociological study in the curriculum. The majority of the faculty retire at the 
close of this college year, Prof. Thomas E. Will being president elect. 
Agricullural and Mechanical College of Kentucky.—The most notable growth has 
been in the course of mechanical engineering. The board of trustees, dissatisfied 
with the want of progress in civil engineering, have reorganized that course of 
study. The good results which are expected to follow the change I hopeI shall 
have the pleasure of noting in my next report. The rapid growth of the depart- 
ments of botany, biology, anatomy, physiology, geology, and physics made addi- 
tional accommodations necessary for these and their equipment. A new building 
has been placed under contract for this purpose. 
Univevsity of Maine.—The most'important changes of the year have been the ap- 
propriation by the State of $20,000 annually, over a period of ten years, to be used for 
current expenses, and the change of name from the ‘Trustees of the State College 
of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts” to the “University of Maine.” 
Maryland Agricultural College.—The departments of farmers’ institutes and State 
entomologist are engaged in the university extension movement, and I am con- 
vinced are doing a good work in diffusing agricultural information, especially among 
the more mature and thinking members of the rural communities. 
Massachusetts Agricultural College.—In the regular course descriptive geometry has 
been dropped and practical work in laboratory physics substituted. In the elective 
studies courses on geology and modern history are offered. The dairy and short 
winter courses were opened for the first time this year, 17 persons availing them- 
selves of the advantages thus offered. The 20 acres purchased by the State (see p. 
1276 of 1895-96 Report of Bureau of Education) have been broken up and prepared 
for orchard and nurseries. This year closes the thirtieth of the existence of the 
college. Excluding those at present pursuing their studies, 1,093 have been admitted. 
Of these 1,001 are living, and of these there are pursuing the vocations named: 
eeeuge and the mechanic arts, 503; business and the various professions of 
ife, 49 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.—[The loss sustained by this great engineering 
school by the death of its late president, Gen. Francis E. W: alker, is more particu- 
larly referred to in the first volume of the Commissioner's report, p. 695.] 
Michigan State Agricultural College.—The past year brought three important changes 
to the college. During the past forty years of the existence of this institution the 
long vacation oceurred in the winter, from November to March. Last winter the 
college changed to the plan followed by most other schools, a change that promises 
to add much to the usefulness of the college. A course of study for women was 
added to the curriculum, and 45 young women entered upon the work. This course 
is strongly characterized by the study of English, modern languages, natural 
science, art, domestic science, and music. Its period is four years, and its degree 
that of bachelor of science. ‘The college also offered, during the past winter, four 
courses, each of six weeks, in fruit culture, floriculture, winter- vegetable gardening, 
home dairying, , and live-stock husbandry. These were well patronized and will be 
continued in the future. 
The University of Minnesota.—The legislature having increased the tax for the ben- 
efit of the university from 0.15 of a mill to 0.23 of a mill, an increase of $40,000, the 
college and school of agriculture will be benefited as one of its departments. The 
legislature also provided for coeducation at the school of agriculture. 
Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College.—Instruction in electricity has been 
added to the course. 
School of Mines of the University of Missouri.—The year has been divided into three 
terms, and the courses reorganized so as to produce greater concentration; thus the 
student, having fewer subjects, has more time to devote to the more important ones. 
College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (Montana).—Several important changes 
have been made in the courses: The elective system has been introduced, thus giv- 
ing students the privilege of electing a part of their studies during the latter years 
of the course. Full four-year courses have been arranged in general science, agri- 
culture, domestic science, and art on the elective system, and four-year courses in 
chemistry, mechanical and electrical engineering without electives. 
University of Nebraska.—Our agricultural group of studies has been adopted to pre- 
pare for the work of the divisions in the United States Department of Agriculture. 
New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts.—The only significant 
change in the course of instruction has been the gradual development of the pre- 
paratory department, resulting from the attempt to place the instruction upon a 
strictly collegiate plan. The possible constituency of the college represents the city 
high school on the one hand, and the district school of the rural village on the other 
hand. The grade of the college has been too low for the-one and too high for the
-P-A-G-E-631
  AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 1759 
other. By raising the standard and offering a preparatory year, it is hoped that 
this difficulty will be overcome. During the year preparatory studies were intro- 
duced into the two-year course in agriculture. 
Rutgers Scientific School.—By a rearrangement of the recitation schedule, the full 
time of the instructor in mathematics, electricity, and physics is now devoted to 
the course in electricity. 
New Mexico College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Aris:—The course of study has 
been enlarged and made to conform as nearly as possible to the requirements of the 
law establishing agricultural colleges, and to meet the needs and requirements of 
the locality in which it is situated. The requirements for admission into the fresh- 
man class have been slightly raised and are about in accordance with those recom- 
mended by the committee of the Association of Agricultural Colleges as a standard. 
Okluhoma Agricultural and Mechanical College.—By Territorial law students are 
admitted to the freshman class on passing a satisfactory examination in the common- 
school branches. As the funds for instruction are exclusively from the act of August 
80, 1890, the nature of the course is strictly determined, but lack of facilities prevents 
us from offering a course in mechanic arts. An extension of the privilege of elect- 
ing studies during the junior and senior years is the only change to be noted. 
Rhode Island College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts.—We anticipate raising 
the standard of the college during the coming year and starting an agricultural high 
school, which will also prepare students for the collegiate department. 
South Dakota State Agriculiural College.—All courses have been carefully revised 
during the year and new ones added. ‘The following indicate the most important of 
these changes: A subfreshman year is provided, with two terms’ work in physies and 
one in botany, and includes elementary algebra, plane geometry, and rhetoric, thus 
raising the standard of admission for freshmen about one year. Chemistry, botany, 
and elementary geology are now studied in the freshman year, thus laying a good 
foundation for taking up technical agriculture early in the course. Many electives are 
offered in the junior and senior years, enabling students to specialize in agriculture, 
agricultural engineering, architecture, electrical, hydraulic, or sanitary engineering, 
and to pursue advanced work in art, domestic science, music, botany, chemistry, 
physics, materia medica, and shorthand. German and Latin are offered for two years, 
and may be carried further. Music is also provided, and may be pursued exclusively 
or in connection with other studies. The course in pharmacy is greatly strengthened ; 
advanced work offered for two years after druggist’s course, and leads to B. S. 
degree. The short course in agriculture is extended to twelve weeks, and is 
enlarged by shopwork and other subjects. Both the business and the amanuensis 
courses are restricted to one year. 
University of Tennessee.—Instruction in domestic arts, introduced tentatively, has 
proven a success and will be permanently established next year. The most gratify- 
ing improvement of the year is the increase in the number of graduate students. 
Agricultural College of Utah.—The preparatory department has been strengthened 
and a class of students has been excluded which has hitherto been admitted, though 
it was found to be a hindrance rather than an advantage to the college. Perhaps 
as many as fifty persons were excluded during the year. The average age of the 
students, 1896-97, is 19.4 years. . 
Agricultural College, Experiment Station, and School of Science of the State of Washing- 
ton.—During the past year the work, other than collegiate, has been arranged under 
the name of schools as follows: School of farming, being a course of two years (each 
of six months) in practical horticulture and agriculture; school of dairying, being a 
ten weeks’ course in butter and cheese making; school of pharmacy, a course of two 
full years in pharmacy; school of veterinary science, being a course of two years in 
veterinary medicine; school of business, being a course of two years in bookkeeping 
with allied branches, or of one year in stenography with allied branches; school of 
mining, being a course of two years in mining, the requirements for admission being 
the same as for freshmen and the work purely technical; and preparatory school, 
two years’ course (formerly three years). The departments of geology and mod- 
ern languages have been enlarged and strengthened; also the department of mining 
engineering. 
University of Wyoming.—A preparatory course of a year has been created for the 
agricultural course. 
Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College (for colored citizens)—The normal 
course is now preparatory to a college course in agriculture, 
Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College.—This is a colored school, 
and we have been able to secure annually some of the best talent to be had to address 
large audiences on economic and other live questions. With the mass of the colored 
people this is the only opportunity they have for hearing addresses from educated 
men on such topics. We have, however, recently inaugurated in the university a 
system which we are trying to make self-sustaining, and by which we secure profes- 
stonal lecturers to lecture, not only to the pupils, but to the colored people generally. 
     
-P-A-G-E-632
1760 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
We put on a nominal admission fee of 15 cents to the public to help pay expenses 
in connection with our own individual contributions. We pay the lecturers (white), 
and have been quite successful so far and expect to reduce the admission fee to as 
near zero as we can safely go. We have established a scientific dairy on the most 
modern plan this session with a class of twenty, and it is working successfully. 
North Carolina Agricultural and Mechanical College for the Colored Race.—We have 
enlarged the preparatory department in order to raise the standard of the regular 
classes. A department of domestic science has been added. 
Colored Normal, Industrial, Agricultural, and Mechanical College of South Carolina.— 
Previous to March, 1896, this institution was know as Claflin College and was 
under the control and management of Claflin University. 
Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute——Work in the department of agricul- 
ture as compared with that of last year has been characterized by better methods of 
instruction, a wider range of topics taught, and an increased and growing interest 
on the part of our students in the subject of agriculture. A new feature of our work 
is the introduction of field practice for its educational value alone, no wages bein, 
paid for this work. This was successful beyond expectation, and will be repeater 
another season. Our courses of study in agriculture have been thoroughly revised, 
and the time required for some of the academic classes for agriculture has been 
doubled. We are now offering six courses in the agricultural department, as follows: 
A course in elementary agriculture, required of the academic students ; a three years’ 
course in agriculture, a@ one year’s course in agriculture, a one year’s course in horti- 
culture, a one year’s course in dairying, a summer course in agriculture. Our facil- 
ities for teaching agriculture are to be " greatly increased during the coming year. 
We are now constructing a two-story brick building, in which about 10, 000 : square 
feet of floor space will be used for agricultural purposes. In this space will be 
arranged a museum and a lecture room, a chemicaland physical laboratory, a botan- 
ical and horticultural laboratory, a farm laboratory, a dairy, and a farm-implement 
and machine room. The ground used for practice work and experiment by the stu- 
dents has been extended this year and will be further enlarged during the coming 
season. In this field work we are not trying to make discoveries of unknown facts, 
but simply to use the soil as a laboratory for the students to work out as far as pos- 
sible the principles taught in the class room, 
Vest Virginia Colored Institute.—We have formulated an academic course which is 
pune to a scientific department, and hope in the near future to have students 
sufficiently advanced to justify the formation of a B. S. course. The students in the 
academic course are some of those who entered the school four years ago in its lowest 
department, using the Third Reader, etc. We shall develop course courses as rapidly 
as we are able to develop the minds of the students. The machine shop of this insti- 
tution is as well equipped as any in.the State, and we have a graduate course in 
practical mechanics at which each boy or young man is required to work at least 
one and a half hours five days ineach week. ‘The equipment and the maintenance of 
the machine shop, coupled with the pro rata yet small amount of Federal aid, has 
prevented our engaging in agricultural instruction to the extent desirable, or even 
constructing a propagating house. 
NEW BUILDINGS (FROM REPORTS OF THE PRESIDENTS). 
Alabama Polytechnic Institute.—An annex to the chemical laboratory has been con- 
structed, at a cost of $3,895. The building is of brick, three stories high, and

frame structure 60 by 100 feet, designed for military purposes and for a gymnasium. 
University of Nebraska.—A dairy building 44 by 40 feet and two stories high has 
been erected. On the first floor is the dairy room proper. A miniature astronomical 
observatory for instructional purposes was completed September, 1896. An agri- 
cultural chemistry palling has been made out of an old stone house for the use of 
the experiment station. The cost of these additions was about $3,900, which does 
at include certain additions to the walls of the electrical laboratory, which cost 
51,100. Nevada State University.—The mechanical building has been completed. The annex 
to this building, 50 by 60 feet, one story, built of brick and stone, containing forg- 
ing room and foundry, was built last year. The main building, just completed, is 
built of brick and stone, two stories, 48 by 90 feet, and unites architecturally every 
desirable feature of a first-class shop of wood and machine work. The cost of the 
building, with the annex, was $9,000, Between $3,000 and $4,000 have been expended. 
in the purchase of machinery and tools. Within three years the university has 
erected and equipped six new buildings, at a cost of about $72,000, and has enlarged 
the university campus by purchase of additional land to 36 acres.

From the rear protrude three glass houses 75 feet in depth. 
University of Wyoming.—A new wing of white sandstone is to be added to the 
mechanical building during the summer (1897) for the purpose of increasing the 
facilities for forge and foundry work. The approximate cost is $1,000. An addition 
will be made to the greenhouse, costing $300 to $500. 
Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical College (for colored citizens).—Palmer Hall, 
which was destroyed by fire June 17, 1896, has been rebuilt at a cost of $5,000. A 
large auditorium has also been erected and additions made to several buildings. 
Delaware State College for Colored Students.—Three new farm buildings and fencing 
for the entire farm have been put up at a cost of $2,000. 
Kentucky Normal School for Colored Persons.—A professor's house was built during 
the past year at a cost of $788, and four additional acres purchased at a cost of $850. 
It is our purpose, during the next school year, to remodel our main school building 
at a cost not to exceed $4,000. 
Southern University and Agricultural College.—We have recenily built in the assem- 
bly hall of the university certain galleries which increase its seating capacity 
one-half. Cost, $750. 
Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College.—Since tho last report a dormitory cost- 
ing $7,000 and a blacksmith shop costing about $3,000 have been completed. 
Colored Normal, Industrial, Agricultural, and Mechanical College of Sowth Carolina.— 
During the year 1896 we built and furnished and equipped the following buildings:

rooms, two offices on the first floor, fifty-two sleeping rooms on the second, third, 
and fourth floors; also, a dining hall with a seating capacity for 800 students, and 
kitchen, etc. These buildings will cost about $25,000. 
Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute.—[The large building devoted to teach- 
ing the mechanic arts, spoken of in the last report of this Bureau, was dedicated 
November, 1896, with imposing ceremonies. The new building for the more thorough 
study of the scientific ideas or natural laws underlying the practical work of agri- 
suleare is mentioned under the name of the school in the preceding section of this 
chapter.] 
The West Virginia Colored Institute.—There is now being constructed a large and 
ornamental brick building for the girls, to cost when completed $18,000. 
THE TEACHING CORPS AND THE ATTENDANCE FOR 1896-97. 
There were, all told, excluding two colleges not reporting (North Carolina and 
Arizona), 25,069 students in the colleges for the Caucasian race, who were taught in 
the departments of agriculture and the mechanic arts by 1,350 men and 122 women. 
The grade of the students is shown by the following table:

  It is to be stated that the amount of money carried over to the year 1897-98 is 
unknown to this Bureau, except in the case of the funds received from the Federal 
Government. In the report for last year it was assumed that the amount received 
from the Government was expended during the course of twelve months, more or 
fewer, irrespective of the beginning of the fiscal year of each State and the date at 
1'The delayed report of the president of the University of Arizona shows a professional corps of 14, 64 men and 53 women in the preparatory department and 27 men and 8 women in the collegiate department. 2 Not including that of several States which fail to report. 
8'Tho total disbursement was $1,056,000, of which $107,182 went to institutions for colored race, as 
follows: Alabama, $9,988; Arkansas, $6,000; Delaware, $4,400; Florida, $11,000; Georgia, $7,333; Ken- 
tucky, $3,190; Louisiana, $11,346; Maryland, $4,400; Mississippi, $11,783; Missouri, $1,196; North Carolina, $7,713; South Carolina, $11,000; Texas, $5,500; Virginia, $7,333; West Virginia, $5,000.

  AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 1765 
which the Federal money was received. With the information at hand it was 
i ible for the Bureau to do otherwise. It can now be stated that of the amount 
    re ed from the Federal Treasury by the States and Territories in the course of 
the latter half of the year 1896, or previously, the sum of $173,080 appears by the 
treasurers’ reports to have been on hand at the date of July 1, 1897, considering the 
white schools apart from the colored. The colored schools report $25,424 of Federal 
money on hand on July 1, 1897, one institution reporting $15,141 to its credit. The 
difficulty appears to be that the practice of asking for an account for the school year 
closing June 30, by the Federal Government, is at variance with the bookkeeping of 
several States whose fiscal year is different from the school year. 
Including all accounts—Federal, State, cr corporate—the presidents’ reports for 
1896-97 show that there was on hand on July 1, 1896, over and above all indebted- 
ness (excluding funded debt, if any), the sum of $606,853, with two institutions not 
reporting. 
‘The institutions for the colored race report the following facts: 
Federal aid: 
Grant of 1862 (income)..

In the University of Michigan “the literary student who intends to 
e has an opportunity, by electing from the courses of the first two years 
of the medical curriculum, of shortening from one and one-half to two years his 
total period of residence at the university.” In the medical school of Yale Uni- 
versity “‘ graduates in arts, philosophy, or science, who have pursued studies in 
chemistry, physiology, anatomy, and histology during their undergraduate courses 
may be admitted to the second-year class, with certain conditions.” A large number 
of medical schools haye similar regulations. 
Upon examination of the diagram showing the percentage of increase in the num- 
ber of students during the ten years 1887-1897, it will be found that while theo- 
logical students increased thirty per cent in number, dental students increased 284 
pet cent, or nearly ten times as fast. While medical students increased 108 per 
cent, law students increased 228 per cent.

    In the scholastic year 1896-97 there were enrolled in various institutions in the 
United States 89,934 students pursuing training courses for teachers, an increase of 
5,534 over the previous year. Of the above total 67,380 normal students were in 
public and private normal schools, 6,489 in universities and colleges, and 16,065 in 
public and private high schools and academies. Of the 89,934 normal students a 
little more than 60 per cent, or 54,039, were in public institutions. The public normal 
schools reported 43,199 of these students, public colleges and universities 1,839, and 
public high schools 9,001. Of the 35,895 normal students in private institutions 
24,181 were in private normal schools, 4,650 in private universities and colleges, and 
7,064 in private high schools and academies. The following table shows the number 
of institutions of each class and the number of normal students in each class for 
three scholastic years: 
Normal students reported for three years.

      The 89,934 students included in the above table are those who were actually pur- 
suing teachers’ training courses in these various institutions. Students in public 
and private normal schools pursuing other courses of study are accounted for else- 
where in this chapter. The 164 public normal schools had more than 48 per cent of 
the normal students reported by the 1,487 institutions, or an average of 263 students 
to the school. The average number of normal students to the private normal school 
was 122. The 196 colleges and universities reporting had an average of 33 normal 
students to the institution, The 507 public high schools and the 422 private high 
schools and academies reporting had an average of 18 and 17 normal students, 
respectively. 
More than 18 per cent of the students enrolled in the public and private normai 
schools were graduated at the end of the year, 6,738 in all. It is safe to estimate 
that a like percentage of normal students in colleges and universities and public and 
1819

private high schools graduated at the same time. The students pursuing teachers’ 
training courses in the various institutions who graduated or completed their courses 
of study at the end of the scholastic year 1896-97 must have numbered approxi- 
mately 16,188. 
PUBLIC NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The statistics of the 164 public normal schools are summarized in Tables 1 to 8 in 
this chapter. Information in detail concerning the individual schools is given in 
Table 19. 
Table 1 shows that there were 1,773 teachers in the public normal schools instruct- 
ing students in normal courses. This was an average of nearly 1i teachers to the 
school. There were 703 teachers wholly for other departments. The States of New 
York and Pennsylvania have 14 schools each, Massachusetts 9, West Virginia, 
North Carolina, Mississippi, and Wisconsin 7 each. No other State reports more 
than 6, and a few States are yet without public normal schools. 
The number of students in the public normal schools of each State is shown in 
Table 2. Of the 43,199 students in training courses for teachers more than 70 per 
cent, or 30,592, were women. The North Atlantic Division had 17,651 normal students 
and the North Central 15,818, these two divisions having more than 77 per cent of 
the students in the public normal schools of the United States. The States of New 
York and Pennsylvania alone had 13,699 of these students, or more than 31 per cent 
of the number for all the States in the Union. 
There were 1,339 students in business courses in 14 of the States. Commercial 
courses are not maintained in the public normal schools of the other States. In 24 
of the States the public normal schools reported 5,145 students in secondary grades. 
Most of these are students preparing to enter the regular normal courses. In 35 of 
the States 14,601 pupils were reported in elementary grades of the public normal 
schools. These pupils are reported as actually belonging to the normal schools, and 
it is said that thousands of them will go up through the secondary grades and finally 
enter the training courses for teachers. These elementary pupils now form the model 
schools in many of the institutions. 
Table 3 shows that the total enrollment in all departments of the public normal 
schools was 64,284, In the 43,199 normal students there were included 1,800 colored 
students. The colored normal schools of the two Southern divisions reported 1,551 
of these students; 202 were reported from the North Atlantic Division and 47 from 
the North Central. The last column of Table 3 shows that 28,038 children were in 
the model schools used by the public normal schools, 7 of the States not reporting 
model schools. 
The number of graduates from public normal schools for the year 1896-97 was 8,032, 
as shown in Table 4. Of these graduates 6,369 were women and 1,663 men. It was 
shown above that the two Northern divisions had more than 77 per cent of the normal 
students. This table shows that they had 6,648 graduates, or nearly 83 per cent of 
the whole number of graduates from the public normal schools of the United States. 
Notwithstanding the ‘‘hard times” the States continue to increase their support 
of the normal schools. As shown above in Table 5, the aggregate amount appropri- 
ated by States, cities, and counties for the running expenses of the public normal 
schools for 1896-97 was $2,426,185, an increase of $238,310 over the previous year. 
This aggregate of nearly two and a half millions was a sum larger than ever before 
received by the public normal schools for support for a single year. In addition to 
public appropriations these schools received $466,195 from tuition, $77,720 from pro- 
ductive funds, and $294,828 from sources not named, making a total income of 
$3,264,928 for the year. 
It is probable that a large part of the $294,828 mentioned as receipts from other 
sources really came from public appropriations. 
Table 6 is a summary showing the value of property of various kinds possessed by 
the public normal schools. The number of volumes reported in 141 of the schools 
       
-P-A-G-E-693
  STATISTICS OF NORMAL SCHOOLS. 1821 
was 461,075, of an estimated value of $485,383. The value of buildings, grounds, 
scientific apparatus, etc., aggregated $18,455,742. The schools received from public 
sources for the year for buildings and improvements appropriations amounting to 
$743,333. This sum is less than the sum received by the schools for this purpose for 
any year since 1892. 
The amount of money received by the public normal schools from public sources 
for support for each year from 1891-92 to 1896-97 is shown in Table 7. The amounts 
received in the same years from public sources for buildings and improvements re 
given in Table 8. 
PRIVATE NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
There were 198 institutions in 1896-97 reporting to this office as private normal 
schools. This was an increase of 29 schools over the number reporting the previous 
year. These are not new institutions, but are schools transferred from other lists. 
A few of them were formerly reported by their principals as public normal schools, 
because they had received certain public aid. Others had been academies, semina- 
ries, and other institutions of secondary grade, which their proprietors transformed 
into training schools for teachers. 
The summaries of private normal school statistics are given in Tables 9 to 14, while 
he information concerning the separate schools is given in Table 20. As may be 
seen from Table 9 there are 15 States and Territories which do not have any private 
normal schools. 
There were 1,030 teachers instructing students in teachers’ training courses in the 
private normal schools. There were 689 teachers for other departments. 
Table 10 shows that the students in the normal departments of these schools were 
divided almost equally between the sexes, 12,095 males and 12,086 females, making a 
total of 24,181. There were 3,875 students in business courses, 7,585 in other courses 
equivalent to courses in high schools, and 17,234 pupils in elementary grades. 
The total enrollment in all grades in these institutions was 52,875. In the model 
schools there were 4,560 children, most of whom were counted in the elementary 
grades of the private normal schools. 
Of the 24,181 normal students in these schools, 2,383 were colored students, 2,347 
of whom were in colored private normal schools of the two Southern divisions, and 
36 in schools of the North Central division. 
Table 12 gives the number of graduates from the teachers’ training departments of 
the private normal schools as 2,294 men and 1,814 women, a total of 4,108. There 
were 1,511 graduates from business courses, and 1,706 from the secondary or high 
school courses. 
The income of the private normal schools, so far as reported, is exhibited in Table 
18. These schools received from tuition $632,218, from public appropriations 
$49,013, from productive funds $50,564, and from other sources and unclassified 
$294,282, making a total of $1,026,077. 
Table 14 exhibits the value of the property possessed by the private normal schools. 
Only 155 of the 198 schools reported libraries. These had 223,067 volumes, whose 
value was estimated at $225,069. The value of buildings and grounds and scientific 
apparatus aggregates $6,911,131. The value of benefactions received by these schools 
for the year amounted to $205,238. The endowment of the private normal schools 
now aggregates $2,880,225. : 
DISTRIBUTION OF NORMAL STUDENTS. 
The statistics of public and private normal schools are compared in Table 15. It 
shows that in the public normal schools the male students comprise 29.18 per cent of 
the total number and the female students 70.82 per cent, while in the private normal 
schools the students are almost equally divided between the sexes. The percentages 
for the different States show great variation, the female students in public normal

  CHAPTER XL. 
STATISTICS OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
In the institutions of various classes reporting to this office for the scholastic year 
ending June, 1897, there were 16,255,093 pupils enrolled. Of this number 584,904, 
or more than 34 per cent, were secondary students, i. e., students who had passed: 
beyond the eight grades of the common school course and were pursuing studies 
usually taught in the four years high-school courses. This was a gain of 25,901 in 
the number of secondary students over the preceding year, or more than 44 per cent. 
The secondary students were distributed among eight classes of institutions, as 
follows: 
  Institutions. | Males. | Females. | Total. aed 1 
Public high schools... 173,445 | 285,988 | 409, 433     
   
         
     
     Public normal schools 1, 537 | 3, 608 5, 145 Public universities and colleges . : 4, 388 1, 493 5, 881 Private high schools 58, 218, 54,415 | 107, 633 Private normal schools 4 2, 899 7, 585 Private universities and colleges. 13, 153 41,109 Private colleges for women 4, 700 4,700 Manual-training schools .. 1,359 3,418   
Total 317,615 | 584, 904 
The secondary students in public high schools, and in private high schools, acad- 
emies, and seminaries numbered 517,066, or more than 88 per cent of the total num- 
ber of secondary students enumerated in the above table. It is a well-known fact 
that there are in the elementary schools of nearly all the States many students pur- 
suing secondary studies because high schools are not accessible. Could these scat- 
tering students be enumerated, it is not improbable that the aggregate of secondary 
students in the United States would reach a figure considerably above 600,000. It 
should be stated here that the 77,746 students enrolled in commercial schools and 
business colleges are not included in this table, although many of the branches 
taught in these institutions are equivalent to high-school studies; but it is obvious 
that students who spend only three or four months in a commercial school should 
not be given the standing of students who enroll for the year in the secondary 
school. 
This chapter is devoted almost exclusively to the statistics of the 7,209 public and 
private high schools reporting to this office for the scholastic year 1896-97. The fol- 
lowing table shows the growth of this class of schools for a period covering the past 
eight years:

1874 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. S 
The increase in the total number of secondary students in public and private high 
schools in eight years has been more than 73 per cent, the increase in the number in 
public high schools being nearly 102 per cent, while the inerease in the private high 
schools and academies was only 13 per cent. The relative progress of public and 
private high schools for the past eight years is shown in the following table which 
gives the proportion of schools, teachers, and students in each of the two classes:

In 1890 about 68 per cent of the secondary students in public and private high 
schools and academies belonged to the public high schools, and nearly 32 per cent 
to the private institutions; in 1897 the proportion belonging to the public high 
schools had increased to over 79 per cent, while less than 21 per cent belonged to 
the private schools. 
This Bureau began to collect the statistics of private high schools, academies, and 
seminaries in 1871, and of city high schools in 1876. It was not until 1889-90 that 
an attempt was made to include all the public high schools of the country. The 
following table shows the relation of the number of public and private high-school 
students to the population each year for twenty-six years:

  STATISTICS OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 1875 
Prior to 1890 the number of students reported by a large number of the private 
high schools included the whole number in attendance, the elementary pupils as 
well as the secondary students. For the past eight years the two classes have been 
reported separately, and as the number of students pursuing each secondary study 
is also given it has not been difficult to exclude from the enumeration all pupils 
below the high-school grades. Taking the reports from 1890 to 1897 as a basis, the 
number of secondary students in private high schools from 1871 to 1889 has been 
carefully estimated for each year, and the corrected figures are given in the above 
table. 
Pusiic HicH ScHoots. 
It has been the practice in this office for a number of years to examine separately 
the statistics of public high schools and of private high schools, academies, and 
seminaries, and finally to combine the results in a statistical review of secondary 
schools. In this chapter tables 1 to 15, inclusive, are summaries of the statistics of 
public high schools, tables 16 to 29 relate exclusively to private high schools and 
academies, while tables 30 to 38 combine the statistics of public and private high 
schools. Tables 39 and 40 show the distribution of secondary students by States in 
the various classes of institutions. 
This office received reports from 5,109 public high schools for the scholastic year 
ending June, 1897, a gain of 135 schools over the preceding year. Only 914 of these 
schools are reported as independent, while 4,195 belong to city or village systems of 
publicschools. Of the latter number 627 are in cities which have 8,000 population 
orover. The 914 independent public high schools are generally outside the cities 
or villages. 
It is shown in Table 1 that there were 16,809 teachers instructing the secondary 
students in the public high schools, the number of men being 7,658 and the number 
of women 9,151. The teachers whose time was wholly employed in instructing 
elementary pupils in many of the schools are not here included. 
The number of secondary students was 409,433, a gain of 28,940 over the previous 
year. There were 173,445 male students, or 42.36 per cent of the whole number, and 
235,988 females, or 57.64 per cent of the total. More than half the secondary students, 
or 210,538, were in the States of the North Central Division, where there were 2,784 
public high schools. The North Atlantic Division had 126,399 secondary students, 
while the three remaining divisions had 72,496. The State of New York alone had 
88,957 secondary students, Ohio 37,958, Illinois 31,909, Massachusetts 31,360, Michi- 
gan 25,745, lowa 24,626, Pennsylvania 24,044, In the colored high schools of the 
two Southern divisions and in the public high schools of the other divisions there 
were 5,477 colored secondary students. The elementary students in lower grades 
attached to the high schools, i. e., all below the secondary grades, numbered 138,061 
for the United States—67,981 males and 70,080 females. 
STUDENTS AND COURSES OF STUDY. 
The number of students reported by the principals as known to be preparing for 
college was 49,850, or about 12 per cent of the total number of secondary students. 
Of this number 27,115 were preparing for the college classical course and 22,735 for 
college scientific courses, as shown in Table 2. The following table is a synopsis 
showing the number and per cent of students in certain courses and studies.

a Per cent to number of graduates.   
The above table shows that while the per cent of male students preparing for 
college was about 15, the number of female students preparing for college was 10 
per cent of the total number of female students. The number of graduates from 
the public high schools in 1897 was 50,042, or over 12 per cent of the number of sec- 
ondary students. There were 18,261 male graduates, or about 10} per cent of the 
male students, and 31,781 female graduates, or 13} per cent of the female students. 
Of the total number graduating 14,641 had declared their intention of going to col- 
lege, i.e.,a little more than 29 per cent of the graduates were college preparatory 
students. More than 36} per cent of the male graduates had prepared for college 
and exactly 25 per cent of the female graduates. 
The last column of Table 2 shows that there were 8,661 public high school students 
receiving instruction in military tactics in 1896-97. 
The number of students pursuing each of the leading high-school studies is given 
in Tables 3 to 8, inclusive. The above synopsis gives the total number in each 
study and the per cent to the total number. Thus there were 198,014 pursuing 
Latin, or 48.36 per cent of the whole number of secondary students. The number 
of boys studying Latin was 78,643, or 45.34 per cent of the whole number of boys in 
the public high schools, while the number of girls studying this language was 
119,371, or 50.58 per cent of the total number of female secondary students. 
Latin was taught in 4,228 of the 5,109 public high schools and Greek in only 930, 
as may be seen from Table 3. It is shown in succeeding tables that French was 
taught in 748 schools, German in 1,366, algebra in 5,061, geometry in 4,499, trigo- 
nometry in 750, astronomy in 1,211, physics in 4,284, chemistry in 1,792, physical 
geography in 4,142, geology in 1,168, physiology in 4,016, psychology in 840, rhetoric 
in 4,408, and history other than that of the United States in 4,326 schools. 
Table 9 gives the proportion of male and female students in the public high schools 
of each State, as well as the per cent of college preparatory students and the per 
cent of graduates to the whole number of secondary students in cach State. Tables 
10 and 11 give the per cent of students in each study to the total number in the 
public high schools in each State.

   STATISTICS OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 1877 
Since 1890 there has been little variation in the proportion of male and female 
students in the public high schools. In 1890 the per cent of female students was 
57.33, and for 1897 it is 57.64. In 1892-93 the per cent of female students was 59.90, 
but since that time there has been a gradual readjustment toward the proportion of 
eight years ago. The percentages of male and female students for each of the last 
eight years are given in the following table:

  The above table shows that there has been a large falling off in the percentage of 
students preparing for college in the past eight years. In 1889-90 the per cent of 
secondary students preparing for college was 14.44, while in 1896-97 the per cent 
was reduced to 12.17. On the other hand, the proportion of graduates has increased 
from 10.78 per cent in 1889-90 to 12.22 per cent in 1896-97. 
While the public high schools have had a wonderful growth in numbers in the 
past cight years, there is abundant evidence that they have gained strength in other 
directions. Many hundreds of schools which formerly offered courses of study made 
up of elementary and secondary branches now confine their instruction strictly to 
high-school studies. This may be seen in the steady increase in the proportion of 
students pursuing these secondary studies. The above table shows that in 1890 
the per cent of students pursuing the study of Latin was 34.69, while in 1897 it had 
increased to 48.36. The per cent studying algebra increased from 45.40 in 1890 to 
55.46 in 1897. The per cent in geometry increased from 21.33 per cent to 26.71 and 
in history other than that of the United States from 27.31 in 1890 to 35.76 in 1897. 
The number of students studying German in 1890 was 10.51 per cent of the whole 
number of high-school students, while in 1897 it was 12.42. There was also a 
marked increase in the per cent of students in French. 
Table 12 is a summary by States of the number of teachers and students belonging 
to the 627 public high schools in cities of 8,000 population and over. These schools 
had 5,920 teachers and 181,410 students. As shown by Table 14, these schools had an 
average of 9.4 teachers to a school, 30.6 students to a teacher, and 289.3 students to 
a school. 
 
-P-A-G-E-749
  1878 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
Table 13 shows that the 4,482 public high schools not in cities of 8,000 population 
and over had 10,889 teachers and 228,023 students. Table 14 shows that in these 
schools there was an average of 2.4 teachers to a school, 20.9 students to a teacher, 
and 50 9 students to a high school. 
The contrast between the city high schools and those outside of the cities is still 
greater in certain States. In the State of New York the number of students to a 
city high school is 389.7; in Rhode Island, 348.9; in Massachusetts, 333.8; in Illinois, 
356; in Michigan, 350.8; in Minnesota, 405.7, and in Missouri, 437.5. In other States 
in which the large cities have only one or two high schools each the averages are 
even larger than those given above. The average number of students to the high 
school in the District of Columbia is 603.8, or 2,413 secondary students in the 4 
high schools. In California the 15 high schools in the cities have 6,337 students, or 
an average of 422.5 to a school. 
EQUIPMENT AND INCOME. 
It is shown in Table 15 that 4,111 of the 5,109 public high schools have libraries 
aggregating 2,209,189 volumes, or an average of 537 volumes to a school. The value 
of grounds, buildings, scientific apparatus, etc., reported by 4,159 schools was 
$76,046,868, or an average of $18,285 to the school. 
Only 1,912 public high schools reported the amount of their income from public 
funds. The aggregate amount reported by these schools was $4,161,775, or an aver- 
age of $2,176.59 to the school. As 4,195 of the public high schools are departments 
of city or village systems it was impossible for the greater part of them to make a 
separate financial showing. It is not improbable that the public funds received by 
the schools not reporting this item would average considerably more than the 
$2,176.59 to the school. 
‘The number of public high schools deriving a portion of their income from tuition 
fees was 1,700, and the aggregate amount received by these schools from this source 
was $500,263. It may be noted that $309,208 of this sum was received by 427 public 
high schools in the two Southern divisions. Only 200 public high schools received 
part of their support from productive funds, such receipts aggregating $208,648. Of 
the number of schools reporting their whole income 868 reported the receipt of 
$1,479,248 without stating the source. It is probable that nearly all this sum should 
be credited to State, city, and county aid. 
The total income of the 2,225 schools reporting this item was $6,349,934, or an 
average of nearly $2,854 to the school. 
PRIVATE HiGH SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES. 
The statistics of the 2,100 private high schools, academies, and seminaries reporting 
to this office for the year 1896-97 are summarized in Tables 16 to 29, inclusive. These 
tables from 16 to 26 are similar in form to Tables 1 to 11, which summarize the statis- 
ties of public high schools, and the two series may be compared with each other. 
Table 27 may also be compared with Table 15. Table 30 is a comparative showing 
of the average numbers of teachers and students in public and private high schools, 
Table 16 shows that there were 2,100 schools reporting, only six less than the 
number reporting the previous year; that these schools had 9,574 teachers instructing 
secondary students, an increase of 822, and that these schools had 107,633 secondary 
students, an increase of only 979. There was a decrease of 447 in the North Atlantic 
Division, 194 in the South Atlantic, 388 in the South Central. There was an increase 
of 1,941 in the North Atlantic and 67 in the Western Division. There were 2,011 
colored secondary students, 1,643 of them in private high schools for the education 
of the colored race in the Southern States. The number of elementary pupils 
reported by the 2,100 schools was 124,502.

  STATISTICS OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 1879 
STUDENTS AND COURSES OF STUDY. 
The number of students preparing for college was 30,330, or a little more than 28 
per cent of the whole number of secondary students in these private schools. Of these 
college preparatory students 19,078 were preparing for the college classical course, 
and 11,252 for scientific courses in colleges and schools of technology. This is shown 
in Table 17. It also appears that 20,300 of the college preparatory students were 
males, or nearly 67 per cent of the total number preparing for college, although the 
secondary students in these institutions are almost equally divided as to sex. The 
number of graduates from these schools in 1897 was 11,772, or neatly 11 per cent of 
the secondary students enrolled, and of these graduates 5,511 had prepared to enter 
college. The last column of Table 17 shows that in this class of schools there were 
6,648 students in military tactics. 
The number of students in each high school study in these private schools in each 
State is given in Tables 18 to 23, inclusive, while the percentages of students in 
certain courses and studies are shown in Tables 24, 25, and 26. The following table 
is a synopsis showing the number and per cent of students by sex in college prepara- 
tory courses, and in the leading high school studies in private institutions of secondary 
grade in the United States:

a Per cent to number of graduates. 
The private high schools were preparing 28 per cent of their students for college, 
while only 12 per cent of the students of public high schools were making such 
preparation. In the private schools 46.67 per cent of the students studied Latin, as 
against 48.36 per cent in the public schools. In the private schools 10.22 per cent 
studied Greek, and only 3.13 per cent in the public schools; 21.83 per cent studied 
French and 18.84 per cent studied German, as compared with 6.86 per cent French 
and 12.42 per cent German in the public schools. The per cent studying algebra in 
the private schools was 49.50, while it was 55.46 for the public high schools. The 
per cent in geometry was 24.45 for the private schools and 26.71 for the public 
schools. In other studies there are not such wide variations.

  1880 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
The above table also shows that there are wide differences in the proportion of 
male and female students pursuing the leading studies. For example, 52.28 per cent 
of the males and 41.19 per cent of the females studied Latin; 16.07 per cent of the 
males and 27.47 per cent of the females studied French; 54.08 per cent of the males 
and 45.02 per cent of the females studied algebra; 28.26 per cent of the males and 
20.72 per cent of the females studied geometry. 
The following table indicates the progress made by the private high schools and 
academies in the past eight years in the increase in the relative numbers of students 
in certain courses and studies:

@ Per cent to total number graduates. 
It appears that the per cent of graduates has increased steadily from 8.50 in 1890 
to 10.93 in 1897. The per cent of students in Latin increased from 31.32 to 46.67, the 
per cent in algebra from 37.12 to 49.50, and the per cent in history other than that of 
the United States from 28.98 to 37.31. Here are indications of the strengthening of 
the secondary courses of study,as in the case of the public high schools. Mixed 
courses, made up of elementary and secondary studies, are being replaced by courses 
in which only the secondary studies proper are included. The demand for the better 
preparation of students for college is being met by the private schools of secondary 
grade in all parts of the country. 
EQUIPMENT AND INCOME. 
Table 27 is a financial exhibit of the private secondary schools, summarized from 
the returns sent to this office. The value of the grounds, buildings, scientific appa- 
ratus, etc., owned by 1,505 of these schools, was $56,288,373, or an average of about 
$37,400 to the school reporting. The libraries owned by 1,445 schools contained an 
aggregate of 1,800,033 volumes. Only 315 of the schools received aid from public 
funds, amounting to $181,168. Tuition fees received by 1,319 schools amounted to 
$5,495,163, The amount of money derived from productive funds for the benefit of

331 schools was $1,866,181, the total value of the endowments of 347 schools being 
reported at $41,609,265. The total income of 1,397 of the 2,100 schools was $8,676,284, 
or an average of $6,211 to the school. During the year 185 schools received bene- 
factions amounting to $627,524, 
DENOMINATIONAL SCHOOLS. 
Religious denominations control 955 of the 2,100 private high schools, academies, 
and seminaries reporting to this office. In these denominational schools there were’ 
50,875 students, or an average of more than 53 students to the school. The number 
of students in the 1,145 nonsectarian schools was 56,758, or an average of less than 
50 students to the school. From tables 28 and 29, which show the number of schools 
in each State controlled by each religious denomination, the following statement is

religious denomination controls each school. 
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
In the preceding pages certain comparisons have been made between public and 
private secondary schools. These comparisons have been made between these two 
classes of schools in each State and are presented in table 30. 
Public and private secondary schools are doing practically the same work. They 
maintain similar courses of study, covering about the same length of time. An 
examination of tables 42 and 43, column 19, will show that a majority of these 
schools require four years’ study before graduation and that very few of the schools 
offer courses of less than three years. 
The statistics of public and private secondary schools are combined in tables 31 
to 38, inclusive. It is shown in table 31 that the 7,209 schools had 26,383 instructors 
of secondary students and 517,066 secondary students. Of these secondary students 
226,663, or 43.84 per cent, were males and 290,403, or 56.16 per cent, were females. 
Table 32 shows that 80,180, or 15.51 per cent, of the secondary students were pre- 
paring for college; 46,193 were preparing for the college classical course, and 33,987 
for college scientific courses. The graduates for 1897 numbered 61,814, or nearly 12 
per cent, of the secondary students, and 20,152, or 32.60 per cent, of the graduates 
had prepared for college.

aPer cent to total number of graduates. 
The above synopsis shows the number and per cent of students, male and female, 
in college preparatory courses, as well as the number and per cent in the 16 leading 
high-school studies. It may be pointed out that a greater proportion of male stu- 
dents study Greek, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, while a greater proportion 
of female students study Latin, French, astronomy, physiology, rhetoric, and history. 
Tables 33 to 38, inclusive, show the number of students in each State in each of 
the 16 studies, and the number of schools in which the studies are taught. Thus, 
Latin was taught in 6,112 schools, while Greek was taught in only 1,938; French was 
taught in 1,869 schools and German in 2,492; algebra was taught in 7,055 schools, 
geometry in 6,282, and trigonometry in 1,554; astronomy was taught in 2,011 schools, 
physics in 5,778, chemistry in 2,757, physical geography in 5,616, geology in 1,817, 
physiology in 5,477, psychology in 1,535, rhetoric in 6,148, and history, other than 
that of the United States, in 6,063 schvols. 
If the number of students pursuing the more important high-school studies has 
increased from year to year, this would indicate that the schools are becoming 
stronger by insisting upon strict adherence to well-selected courses from which mere 
elementary studies have been eliminated. The following table serves to illustrate 
the growth of the schools in this regard since 1890:

SECONDARY STUDENTS IN THE UNITED STATES. 
The distribution of secondary students among eight classes of institutions is shown 
in the brief summary on the first page of this chapter. The total number of such 
students is given as 584,904, of which number the public and private high schools 
reviewed in this chapter had 517,066. The distribution of secondary students in the 
eight classes of institutions and by States is given in Tables 39 and 40. It is shown 
that there were 420,459 of these students in public institutions; 409,433 being in 
public high schools; 5,881 in the preparatory departments of public universities, and 
colleges, and 5,145 in public normal schools. Of the 164,445 secondary students in 
private institutions, 107,633 were in private high schools, academies, and seminaries; 
45,809 in the preparatory departments of private universities and colleges; 7,585 in 
private normal schools, and 3,418 in manual training schools. 
Table 41 shows the number of secondary students to each 1,000 of population in 
the United States and in each State. For the whole country there was an average 
of a little over 8 such students to 1,000inhabitants. For the North Atlantic Division 
the average was 8.97; for the South Atlantic, 4.72; for the South Central, 4.92; for 
the North Central, 10.59, and for the Western Division, 8.35. The average for Maine 
was 17.77; for Iowa, 14.61; for Vermont, 14.59; for Massachusetts, 14.29; for New 
Hampshire, 14.14; for the District of Columbia, 13.39; for Michigan, 12.72; for Ohio 
12.37, and for Nebraska, 12.58. 
The number of students in higher education to each 1,000 inhabitants in each 
State is given in the last column of Table 41. The 140,133 students receiving higher 
instruction include all the college and resident graduate students in universities and 
colleges, and all professional students in theology, medicine, and law in all the 
institutions. The independent professional schools are included, as well as those 
classed as departments of universities. Students of normal schools and schools of 
dentistry, pharmacy, veterinary surgery, and nurse training are not here included. 
Table 42 contains in detail the statistics of the 5,109 public high schools, and 
Table 43 gives similar statistics of the 2,100 private high schools and academies 
and other institutions for private secondary instruction.

   CHAPTER XLI 
STATISTICS OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
There are 578 cities in the United States claiming to have more than 8,000 popula- 
tion cach. In these cities there are 601 distinct systems of city public schools, a 
number of cities having two or more school organizations. In 1890-91 there were 
only 442 such systems, with an enrollment of 2,627,275 pupils. For 1896-97 the enroll- 
ment in the 601 city systems was 3,590,875, an increase of 963,600, or 36.67 per cent in 
six years. In the same time the enrollment in the public schools outside of the cities 
of 8,000 population increased from 10,422,857 in 1890-91 to 11,061,617 in 1896-97. This 
was an increase of 638,760, or a little more than 6 per cent. This wide difference in 
the rate of increase in enrollment in city and country schools is partly due to the 
fact that in 1890-91 more than 150 of the systems now classed as city systems were 
yet outside of cities of 8,000 population and over, and the enrollment in these 150 
systems is now in effect subtracted from the enrollment in country schools and added 
      
    
   
   
    
    
      
   
      
    
   
          
  to that in city schools. Whether this accounts for the whole difference in the rate 
of increase or not the fact remains that the enrollment in public schools in cities of 
8,000 population and over in 1890-91 was only about 20 per cent of the total public 
school enrollment of the United States, while in 1896-97 the enrollment in cities of 
like size is 244 per cent of the public school enrollment for the whole country. 
The following table is a summary of statistics of school systems of cities contain- 
ing over 8,000 inhabitants, showing increase or decrease from previous year:

  a Decrease. 
In 1890 the cities of 8,000 population and over had 29.2 per cent of the population 
of the entire country. In 1897 the estimated population of the United States, based 
largely upon the school census of the previous year in most of the States, was 
71,374,142, The aggregate population claimed by the cities of 8,000 inhabitants and 
over wes 24,878,211, or 34.86 per cent of the total population. This percentage is 
manifestly too great, the actual population of most cities being considéraly below 
the ‘‘claimed” population. The total population of these cities, estimated on the 
basis of the latest school census of each city, was 22,531,091 for 1897, or 31.57 per 
cent of the estimated population of the United States for that year. 
The statistics of city school systems are summarized in Tables 1 to 20 in this chap- 
ter, and certain comparisons are drawn between the public schools of the cities and 
the public schools outside of cities of 8,000 population and over. 
Table 1 shows for each State the number of city systems of public schools, the 
enrollment in these public schools, the aggregate number of days attended, the aver- 
2167

age daily attendance, the number of supervising officers, and the number of teach- 
ers, male and female, The estimated enrollment in private and parochial schools is 
also given. The public school enrollment in the cities, 3,590,875, was an increase 
of 106,620, or 3.06 per cent, over the preceding year. The aggregate attendance, 
507,622,259, was an increase of 17,835,554, or 3.64 per cent. Theestimated enrollment 
in private and parochial schools, 824,609, was a decrease of 24,151, or 2.85 per cent, 
from the year before, The number of teachers in 1896-97 was 74,117, an increase of 
3,792, or 5.39 per cent, although the number of supervising officers was 79 less. 
Table 2 is an exhibit of the school property owned by city school systems, and 
shows the amount of money expended for teaching and for all purposes in the cities 
of each State. These city schools occupied 8,604 buildings, in which were 3,397,275 
seats for study, showing an increase of less than 1 per cent in seating capacity from 
the preceding year. The value of school property was $267,050,289, an increase of 
$9,813,706, or 3.82 per cent, in one year. The amount of money expended for teach- 
ing and supervising was $48,772,485, an increase of $2,024,620, or 4.33 per cent, over 
the previous year. The aggregate expenditure of the 601 city systems for all pur- 
poses, except repayment of loans and interest on bonds, was $84,866,092, an increase 
of $1,823,974, or 6.03 per cent, over 1895-96. 
Table 3 is a bird’s-eye view of the statistics of city school systems summarized by 
States, preceded by a review for the past five years by geographical divisions and 
for the United States as a whole. The table shows that for 1896-97 the enrollment 
in private schools was only 18.7 per cent of the total school enrollment in cities; 
that the average daily attendance in the public schools was 74.8 per cent of the pub- 
lic school enrollment; that the average number of days’ attendance of each pupil 
enrolled was 141.4; that the average length of school term was 188.9; that the 
average number of pupils in attendance to each teacher was 36.3; that the average 
number of teachers to each supervising officer was 19.3. The table also shows that 
the average number of seats for each 100 pupils in attendance was 126.4; that the 
average number of seats to a building was 395; that the value of school property 
per capita of pupils in average attendance was $99.36; that the cost of teaching and 
supervising per capita of pupils in average attendance was $18.15; that the total 
cost of maintaining the schools per capita of pupils in average attendance was $31.58; 
that the average cost per day of tuition for one pupil was 9.61 cents, and that the 
average daily expenditure per pupil for all purposes was 16.72 cents. 
Table 4 shows that there were 627 high schools belonging to the 601 city systems. 
These high schools had 5,920 instructors, 2,288 males and 3,632 females. In ‘the high 
schools there were 181,410 secondary students, 73,872 males and 107,538 females. 
The average number of teachers to a high school was 9.4, the average number of 
students to a teacher 80.6, and the average number of students to a high school 
was 289.3. The table gives similar statistics for each State. Statistics of all the 
high schools in the United States are given in Chapter XL. 
Table 5 summarizes the statistics of evening schools belonging to the public school 
systems of cities. There were in 1896-97 in cities of 8,000 population and over 813 
such schools, with 4,141 teachers and 183,168 pupils. It is scen that 558 of these 
schools, with 140,053 pupils, are in the cities of the North Atlantic division, 201 
being in Massachusetts and 151 in Pennsylvania. 
Table 6 is a summary of the statistics of kindergartens belonging to the public 
school systems of cities. In the cities of 8,000 population and over there were 1,077 
public kindergartens, conducted by 2,024 teachers. In these kindergartens were 
81,916 pupils, 35,968 boys and 37,883 girls. Nearly all the public kindergartens 
were in the cities of the North Atlantic and North Central divisions. The second part 
of the table shows that in cities and villages of over 4,000 but less than 8,000 popula- 
tion there were 80 kindergartens, conducted by 139 teachers. These kindergartens 
had 4,717 pupils, 2,052 boys and 2,218 girls. Lists of cities showing the number 
of kindergartens, kindergarten teachers, and pupils are given in Tables 21 and 22.

ulation and over are given in Tables 23 to 26. The statistics of the public schools of 
307 cities and villages containing between 4,009 and 8,000 inhabitants are given in 
detail in Table 27, at the conclusion of this chapter. 
CITY AND RURAL SCHOOLS COMPARED, 
For the purpose of comparing certain statistics of public schools in cities of 8,000 
population and over with like statistics of the public schools outside of such cities, 
Tables 7 to 16 have been arranged. It can not be said that all the schools not in 
cities of 8,000 population and over are rural schools, but as a rule the schools in the 
smaller cities and in the villages present conditions similar to those in rural schools. 
In the public schools of the 307 citiés and villages of from 4,000 to 8,000 population 
there were 321,435 pupils enrolled, as shown in Table 20. In only a small number 
of these cities and villages have the public schools reached the high standard of 
organization maintained by the larger cities. The comparisons made in this chapter 
will not be vitiated by considering the public schools of the smaller cities as a com- 
ponent part of the rural schools of the country. In the census reports for 1890 the 
aggregate population of all cities of 8,000 population and over was considered to be 
the urban population of the United States, while all the population outside of such 
cities was classed as rural population. 
Table 7 gives the estimated population of the United States and of each State, 
based upon the latest school census in each State, as reported by superintendents of 
public instruction, This estimated population was for the whole country 71,374,142 
in 1897. The aggregate population of the cities of 8,000 population and over was 
22,531,091, estimated largely on the basis of the scholastic population. According 
to these careful estimates the urban population of the United States was 31.57 per 
cent in 1897, as compared with 29.20 per cent in 1890. The rural population in 1897 
was 48,843,051, or 68.43 per cent of the total population. The ‘‘claimed” population 
of the cities is given in the third column of Table 7, but is not used for purposes of 
comparison, the aggregate being manifestly too great. In a few States where the 
school census was defective the population was estimated by using the 1890 ratio, 
and in five States the “claimed” city population is placed in column 5 for the same 
Treason. 
Table 8 gives the number of children of school census age in the cities, outside of 
the cities, and for the whole United States. In the cities the children of school-cen- 
sus age numbered 5,893,132, or 26.16 per cent of the city population; outside of the 
cities there were 15,084,884 children of school-census age, or 30.88 per cent of the 
total rural population. The number of children of school-census age for the United 
States was 20,978,016, or 29.39 per cent of the total population. This total of 
20,978,016 was not the number of children from 5 to 18 years of age, but the number 
actually reported or estimated by State superintendents of public instruction. The 
last column of the table shows the ages for enumeration in the cities, being in most 
cases also the ages for enumeration in the entire State. 
Table 9 shows the number of pupils enrolled in the cities, outside of the cities, 
and in the whole country. The number enrolled in the cities was 3,590,875, or 15.94 
per cent of the city population; the number enrolled outside of the cities was 
11,061,617, or 22.65 per cent of the rural population. The combined enrollment was 
14,652,492, or 20.53 per cent of the total population. The same table also shows that 
the enrollment in cities was 60.93 per cent of the school population of those cities, the 
enrollment outside of cities was 73.33 per cent of the rural school population, and 
the enrollment for the whole country was 69.85 per cent of the total school popula- — 
tion. The comparison shows that in the matter of enrollment the advantage is 
decidedly in fayor of the rural schools. 
Table 10 gives the aggregate and average attendance and average length of school 
term in the cities and outside of the cities in each State. The average length of 
school term in the cities was 188.9 days, or nearly nine and one-half months, while 
the length of term outside these cities was 122.8 days, or nearly six months and three 
   
-P-A-G-E-1041
2170 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
days. In the cities of only three States does the average length of school term fall 
below eight and one-half months, but in the rural schools there are wider variations. 
The shortest average term in the rural schools of any State is 61.7 days and the 
longest average term is 183.4 days. In six States the school term is less than four 
months, and in fourteen States less than five months. The average length of school 
term for the United States, as shown in the last column of the table, was 140.4 days, 
or about seven months. 
Table 11 is a comparison of public high school statistics for city and rural schools. 
The 627 high schools in cities had 181,410 secondary students, this number being 
5.05 per cent of the public-school enrollment of the cities. The 4,482 high schools 
outside of the cities of 8,000 population and over had 228,023 students, or only 2.06 
per cent of the rural-school enrellment. The last column of the table shows that 
2.79 per cent of the pupils enrolled in the public schools of the United States consti- 
tuted the public high school enrollment. It may be observed that in a number of 
States the high schools of the cities had more than 8 per cent of the city public 
school enrollment. For the North Atlantic and Western divisions the percentages 
were 6.33 and 6.43, respectively. 
Table 12 shows that male teachers constituted only 7.79 per cent of the teaching 
force in the cities, while in the rural schools it was composed of 38.16 per cent males 
and 61.84 per cent females. It may be noted that nearly all the 3,859 supervising 
officers in the city schools were males. If these be included, the teaching and super- 
vising force of the cities would be composed of about 12 per cent males and 88 per 
cent females. For the whole United States the percentage of male teachers in the 
public schools was 32.6, 
Table 13 shows the whole amount expended for public schools in cities of 8,000 
population and over, the amount expended outside of such cities, and the aggregate 
for the whole country. The $84,866,092 expended for city public schools was $3.77 
per capita of city population. The $102,460,846 expended for rural schools was $2.10 
per capita of population outside of the cities. The total amount expended for pub- 
lie schools in the United States for 1896-97 was $187,326,938, or $2.62 per capita of 
population. The expenditure for city public schools, as shown in the second col- 
umn of the table, presents wide variations. The per capita expenditure is but 96 
cents in the cities of one State, and exceeding $5 per capita in the cities of several 
other States. The expenditure per capita of population was as low as 32 cents in 
one State and as high as $4.84 in another. In the two Southern divisions the per 
capita expenditure for rural schools is less than $1. 
Table 14 shows that the amount of money expended for teaching and supervising 
in cities, $48,772,485, was 57.47 per cent of the total expenditure for public schools. 
In the rural schools the expenditure for teaching, $70,531,057, was 68.84 per cent of the 
total expenditure. For the United States the expenditure for teaching and super- 
vising was $119,303,542, or 63.69 per cent of the total expenditure for public schools. 
Table 15 shows that in the cities the average expenditure per pupil, based on 
average attendance, was $31.58, and that in the rural schools the average was only 
$13.84 per pupil for the school year. For the whole country the average per pupil was 
$18.56. The average expenditure per pupil in city schools is as high as $48.89 in one 
State and as low as $11.88 in another. The expenditure per pupil in rural schools 
‘varies from $3.53 in one State to $48.74 in another. 
The average sums received by teachers and supervisors for the whole school year 
without regard to the number of months of service are given in the second part of 
Table 15. The teachers and supervisors in city schools received $625.48, while the 
average sum received in the rural schools was $216.78, the average for the whole 
country being $295.79. The highest city average in any State was $844.93 and the 
lowest $322.47. The highest average for the rural schools in any State was $549.90 
and the lowest was $70.82. 
Table 16 presents the estimated average salaries of teachers in the city and rural 
schools of the United States. The first column shows the average monthly salary of| 
     
-P-A-G-E-1042
  STATISTICS. OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 2171 
male teachers in each State and the second column the average monthly salary of, 
female teachers as derived from the reports of State superintendents of public | 
instruction. The next column gives the average salaries of teachers and supervisors 
in the city schools as $66.19 per month. This is found by dividing the average sum 
received by teachers and supervisors in city schools, $625.48, by the average length of 
the school term in months, The average, $625.48, was found by dividing the amount 
expended for teaching and supervising by the number of teachers and supervisors. 
This gives an average somewhat larger than the true average for teachers and much 
less than the true average for supervisors. The same method shows an average of 
$35.31 per month for teachers and supervisors in the rural schools. The average! 
monthly salary of teachers and supervisors in the public schools is estimated at 
$42.14 for the whole country. The average monthly salary in the city schools of the 
North Atlantic Division was $66.75 and in the rural schools $34.22; in the South 
Atlantic Division $58.92 in the city schools and $28.93 in the rural schools; in the 
South Central Division $60.86 in the city schools and $36.30 in the rural schools; ia 
the North Central Division $64.68 in the city schools and $32.70 in the rural schools; 
in the Western Division $83.01 in the city schools and $53.22 in the rural schools. 
  RELIGIOUS EXERCISES IN CITY SCHOOLS. 
To ascertain the nature of religious exercises in the public schools of the cities 
this office in 1896 sent to each city superintendent the following request for informa- 
tion: 
Please state whether yeu have any religious exercises in your schools, or whether 
these are forbidden by the regulations. 
In case you have religious instruction, is it limited to the reading of the Bible, or 
are other exercises allowed? 
Please state the nature of such religious exercises or instruction. Is the Bible or 
the New Testament read, or some book of selections? 
In response to the above inquiry 531 superintendents in cities of 8,000 population 
and over sent information, and replies were received from 277 superintendents in 
cities of less than 8,000 population. The information furnished by the 531 superin- 
tendents is summarized in Table 17, and that from the 277 superintendents in Table 
18. The statistics of these two tables are combined in Table 19. 
Table 17 shows that of the 531 cities 425 have religious exercises in their public 
schools and 106 have not. In 57 of the latter such exercises are prohibited by law or 
regulation. The superintendents of 446 cities reported that religious exercises were 
not prohibited in their schools, while 28 did not answer this question. In 29 cities the 
religious exercises are limited to the reading of the Bible, in the schools of 381 cities 
the Bible is read, in 3 cities the New Testament only, and in 5 the Old Testament

In the Education Report for 1895-96, Chapter XV, was reprinted a valuable report, 
made by Prof. Edmund J. James, Ph. D., to the American Bankers’ Association, on 
the subject of Commercial Education in Europe, particularly in Austria, France, and 
Germany. The report gives in minute details the courses of study in many of the 
leading institutions, in which many of the proprietors of business schools in the 
United States have already found suggestions of great value. In the first volume 
of the present Report, Chapter VI is devoted to commercial education in Europe. 
It deals particularly with the history and present status of commercial schools in 
Germany, Austria, England, Switzerland, France, Belgium, and Italy. These two 
chapters are commended to the careful perusal of all educators who are interested 
in the improvement of commercial schools in this country.

    CHAPTER XLIII. 
STATISTICS OF SCHOOLS FOR MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL 
TRAINING. 
Manual training is by no means a novelty in American schools. Thomas Jefferson 
recommended it for the students of the University of Virginia, and Benjamin_ 
Franklin included it in his plan for an academy in Philadelphia. An active propa- 
ganda was carried on in behalf of manual labor in educational institutions for 
many years, beginning about 1830, and some of our foremost institutions had their 
origin under its influence. 
But what is now known as “manual training” is traced to an exhibit of a Russian 
institution at the centennial in 1876. The value of the system of hand training 
there suggested was recognized by such men as Louis D. Runkle and C. M. Wood- 
ward, who became advocates of the new idea and introduced it into the institutions 
under their charge. 
Strong opposition was met among schoolmen for a time, but manual training has 
steadily grown in popularity, and with its growth it has constantly improved in 
matter and method, and consequently in usefulness. 
In 1896 manual training was an essential feature in the public school course of 95 
cities. In 359 institutions other than city schools there is training which partakes 
more or less of the nature of manual training and which belongs in a general way 
to the same movement. These institutions embrace almost every class known to 
American education, and the manual features vary from the purely educational 
manual training of the Teachers College in New York City to the direct trade 
instruction.of the apprentice schools. 
In many cases the legislatures have taken cognizance of the movement. Massa- 
chusetts requires every city of 200,000 inhabitants to maintain high-school manual- 
training courses approved by the State board of education; Maine authorizes any 
city or town to provide instruction in industrial or mechanical drawing to pupils 
over 15 years of age; industrial training is authorized by general laws in Connecti- 
cut, Georgia, Indiana (in cities of over 100,000 population), New Jersey, New York, 
Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Congressional appropriations are regularly made 
for manual training in the District of Columbia. 
In the Report of this office for the year 1893-94 a chapter was devoted to the sta- 
tistics of manual and industrial training, pages 2093 to 2169. To the same Report 
Prof. C. M. Woodward, director of the Manual Training School of Washington Uni- 
versity, St. Louis, Mo., contributed a chapter on ‘The rise and progress of manual 
training,” pages 877 to 949. In the 1895-96 Report, pages 1001 to 1152, is an exami- 
nation of the courses of instruction in typical institutions offering manual or indus- 
trial training.

  2280 — EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
In the following pages is printed a list of the leading manual-training schoolsin 
the United States with their statistics for the scholastic year 1896-97. Table 1 gives 
the statistics of 66 manual and industrial training schools and 24 industrial schools 
for Indian children reporting to this office. In the 66 manual and industrial training 
schools there were 551 teachers, 289 males and 262 females. These schools had 19,841 
pupils in industrial and manual training, 12,123 males and 7,718 females. The 
amount of money paid to teachers in 48 of these schools was $288,890; the amount 
spent for materials by 41 of the schools was $43,889; the amount spent by 35 schools 
for new tools and repairs was $37,139; the amount for incidentals for 30 schools was 
$43,905, and the total expenditure reported by 54 of the 66 schools was $475,787. 
In the 24 Indian schools there were 286 teachers, 132 males and 154 females; 4,555 
pupils, 2,645 males and 1,910 females. The amount paid to teachers was $101,465 for 
18 of the schools, and the total expenditure for the same schools was $145,159. 
In the fourth column of the table the grade of literary instruction in each school 
is indicated. More than 30 of the 66 institutions are of high-school grade. The lit- 
erary instruction in 9 of the Indian schools is also of secondary grade. Many of the 
66 manual and industrial training schools in the first part of the table are also 
included in the lists of secondary schools given in Chapter XL. 
Table 2 gives for each school a statement in detail showing the number of pupils 
in each branch of manual or industrial training, the number of instructors in each 
branch, and the number of weeks devoted to each subject during the entire course.

The total enrollment in the public schools of the 16 Southern States and the Dis- 
trict of Columbia for the year 1896-97 was 5,398,076, the number of colored children 
being 1,460,084 and the number of white children 3,937,992. The estimated number 
of children in the South from 5 to 18 years of age was 8,625,770. Of this number 
2,816,340, or 32.65 per cent, were children of the negro race, and 5,809,430, or 67.35 
per cent, were white children. By reference to Table 1 on page 2297 it will be 
seen that the number of colored children enrolled was 51,84 per cent of the colored 
school population, and the number of white children enrolled was 67.79 per cent of 
the white school population. The average daily attendance in the public schools of 
the Southern States was 3,565,611, the number in the colored schools being 904,505, 
or 61.95 per cent of the colored school enrollment, and the number in average attend- 
ance in the white schools being 2,661,106, or 67.58 per cent, of the white school 
enrollment. 
It may be noted that in Louisiana; Mississippi, and South Carolina the colored 
school population exceeds the white school population. In Kentucky the number 
of colored children enrolled was 65.52 per cent of the colored school population, a 
percentage of enrollment for the colored schools greater than in any other State, 
and larger than the percentage of white enrollment in at least six of the Southern 
States. In the colored schools of Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, and South Carolina 
the average daily attendance was a greater percentage of their enrollment than was 
credited to the white schools of the same States upon their enrollment. Of the 
119,893 public school teachers in the Southern States, 27,435 belong to the colored 
race. There was one colored teacher to every 33 colored children in average attend- 
ance, and one white teacher to every 29 white children in average attendance. 
For the year 1896-97 the total expenditure for the public schools of the 16 Southern 
States and the District of Columbia was $31,144,801. The cost of the schools for the 
colored race can not be aceurately stated, but a fair estimate would place the cost 
of the colored schools at about $6,575,000. This is something over 20 per centof the 
aggregate expenditure for the Southern States, while the average attendance of col- 
ored children was about 26 per cent of the entire average attendance of white 
and colored pupils. Since 1870 the amount of money expended for public schools in 
2295
-P-A-G-E-1167
  2296 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
the South has reached $514,922,268. It is believed that about $100,000,000 of this 
sum must have been expended for the education of the colored children. ‘The total 
expenditure for each year, and the aggregate for the twenty-seven years, as well as 
the common school enrollment of white and of colored children for each year since 
1876 are shown in Table 2 on the next page. 
SECONDARY AND HIGHER EDUCATION. 
There are at least 178 schools in the United States for the secondary and higher 
education of colered youth exclusively. For the year 1896-97 only 169 of these 
schools reported to this office, Of this number 1 was in Illinois, 2 in Indiana, 1 in 
New Jersey, 2 in Ohio, and 3 in Pennsylvania, the remaining 160 being in the Sonth- 
ern States. These schools are all to be found classified according to their grades in 
the lists of universities and colleges, normal schools, and public and private second- 
ary schools in other chapters of this annual report, but more complete statistics 
are given for each of these schools in detail in Tables 9 and 10 of this chapter, and 
summarized in Tables 3 to 8. 
Table 3 shows that in the 169 schools there were employed 1,795 professors and teach- 
ers, 787 males and 1,008 females. There was a total enrollment in these schools of 45,402 
students, 20,243 males and 25,159 females, an increase of 5,275 over the enrollment of 
the previous year. In collegiate grades there were 2,108 students, 1,526 males and 582 
females, an increase of 653 over the previous year. In the secondary grades there 
were 15,203 students, 6,944 males and 8,259 females, an increase of 1,640 over the year 
before. In the elementary grades of these secondary and collegiate institutions there 
were 28,091 pupils, 11,773 males and 16,318 females, an increase of 2,999 over the year 
1895-96. 
The classification of students according to courses of study is given in Table 4 and 
part of Table 5. In all the colored schools there were 2,410 students pursuing the 
classical course, 1,312 males and 1,098 females. There were 974 students in scientific 
courses, 447 males and 527 females. In English courses there were 11,340 students, 
4,667 males and 6,673 females. The business courses had 295 students, 179 males and 
116 females. Table 5 shows that there were 5,081 students in normal or teachers’ 
training courses, 2,382 males and 2,699 females. 
Table 5 shows that there were 117 graduates from college courses, 103 males and 
14 females. There were 1,256 graduates from normal courses, 5387 males and 719 
females. The high school courses had 846 graduates, 333 males and 513 females. 
The number of students pursuing professional courses and the number of gradu- 
ates from such courses are givenin Table 6. In all there were 1,311 professional stu- 
dents, 1,137 males and 174 females. There were 611 students and 68 graduates in 
theology, 104 students and 30 graduates in law, 345 students and 71 graduates in medi- 
cine, 38 students and 10 graduates in dentistry, 39 students and 20 graduates in 
pharmacy d 174 students and 35 graduates in nurse 
Table 7 shows that in the 169 schools for the colored race there were 13,581 pupils 
and students receiving industrial training, 4,970 males and 8,611 females. The 
number in industrial training was almost 40 per cent of the total enrollment in these 
schools. There were 1,027 of these pupils being trained in farm and garden work, 
1,496 in carpentry, 166 in brickiaying, 144 in plastering, 149 in painting, 85 in tin 
and sheet metal work, 227 in forging, 248 in machine-shop work, 185 in shoemaking, 
689 in printing, 6,728 in sewing, 2,349 in cooking, and 2,753 in other trades, 
The financial summary of the 169 colored schools is given in Table 8. In the 
libraries of these schools there were 224,794 volumes, valued at $203,731. The aggre- 
gate value of grounds, buildings, furniture, and scientific apparatus was $7,714,958. 
‘The value of benefactions or bequests received during the year 1896-97 was $303,050. 
The schools received from public funds for support for the year $271,839, from tuition 
fees $141,262, from productive funds $92,080, and from sources not named $540,097, 
making an aggregate income of $1,045,278 for the year.

         “SOCIAL AND PHYSICAL CONDITION OF NEGROES IN CITIES.” 
Under the above title the Atlanta University has recently published a valuable 
report of an investigation made under the direction of that institution by a number 
of its graduates. ‘The introduction to that report and the three leading papers 
by the principal investigators are reprinted below: 
INTRODUCTION, 
The papers presented in this report were written exclusively by colored men and 
women, and are based upon statistical investigations made by them under the 
direction of Atlanta University. 
The investigation was begun by an inquiry on the part of three graduates of 
Atlanta University into the causes of the excessive mortality among negroes. A 
conference was held on the subject at Atlanta University in May, 1896, and the facts 
brought out at that conference were so significant that the investigation was con- 
tinued. for another year along similar lines, but on a more extensive scale, and a 
second conference was held in May, this year. The cooperation of graduates of 
other institutions was invited. The present investigation, therefore, is the result 
of the joint efforts of graduates of Atlanta University, Fisk, Berea, Lincoln, Spelman, 
Howard, Meharry, and other institutions for the higher education of the negroes. 
The conclusions which these men and women have reached as a result of their 
investigations are, in some respects, most surprising; especially their conclusions as 
to the effect of environment and economic conditions upon the vital energies of the 
race. Their conclusions were, in substance, that the excessive mortality of their 
people can not be attributed in any large degree to unfavorable conditions of environ- 
ment, but must be chiefly attributed to the ignorance of the masses of the people 
and their disregard of the laws of health and morality. The significance of this 
conclusion is tersely expressed by one of the writers, who says: 
“This last fact, that the excessive death rate of the colored people does not arise 
from diseases due to environment, is of vast importance. If poor houses, unhealthy 
localities, bad sewerage, and defective plumbing were responsible for their high 
death rate, there would be no hope of reducing the death rate until either the col- 
ored people became wealthy, or philanthropic persons erected sanitary houses, or 
municipalities made appropriations to remove those conditions. But since the 
excessive death rate is not due to these causes, there is reason for the belief that it 
may be reduced without regard to the present economic condition of the colored 
eople.” 
The attention of the members of the conference seemed to be mainly directed to 
a consideration of the social questions affecting the progress of the race. The 
sentiment of the conference was voiced by one writer in these words: 
“Tf we are to strike at the root of the matter, it will not be at sanitary regulation, 
but at social reconstruction and moral regeneration.” 
The solution of the problem will be found in the wise direction of the numerous 
charitable, religious, and educational organizations of colored people already estab- 
lished. As a means toward that end, the university will continue the city problem 
investigation along the lines upon which it was begun, and will hold a third con- 
ference at Atlanta next May. The subject of the next conference can not now be 
announced, but in accordance with the expressed wish of meinbers of the last con- 
ference, it will be some subject dealing with the social conditions of the people. 
The result of the present investigation has been, on the whole, distinctly encour- 
aging. In the opinion of the committee having the investigation in charge, the 
negro has nothing to fear from a most rigid and searching investigation into his 
physical and social condition, but such an investigation can be made most helpfal 
and valuable. 
    RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION. 
[Nore.—The three following papers on the results of the investigation were written 
by the three members of the conference who individually collected the most data: 
Mr. Butler R. Wilson, a member of the committee, who gathered data relating to 100 
families that had migrated from North Carolina to Cambridge, Mass.; Prof. Eugene 
Harris, of Fisk University, who made an extensive investigation in Nashville, 
and Mr. L. M. Hershaw, of Washington, D. C., who had in charge the very labori- 
ous work of analyzing the reports of the boards of health for the past fifteen 
years.—ED. ]

2302 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
GENERAL SUMMARY.! 
Th making this investigation of the habits, morals, and environment of negroes 
living in cities, three things have been kept constantly in view, viz: 
First. To obtain accurate information, without regard to cherished theories or 
race pride; 
Second. ‘To make the i inquiry practical and helpful, and not merely for scientific 
results; and, t 
Third. To induce the people to apply the remedies which they have in their own 
hands for the evils which are found to exist and which retard their progress. 
The results to be gained depended entirely upon tho intelligence and titness of the 
investigators, who were selected with great care from the ranks of well-known 
colored educators, ministers, physicians, lawyers, and business men living among 
the people covered by the investigation. All the data were gathered by this body 
of trained colored leaders, and they are believed to be perhaps more than usually 
accurate, because of the investigators’ knowledge of the character, habits, and 
prejudices of the people, and because of the fact that they were not hindered by 
the suspicions which confront the white investigator, and which seriously affect the 
accuracy of the answers to his questions. 
The work of the investigators was entirely voluntary and was done with a will- 
ingness and industry highly gratifying. 
The cities embraced in the investigation, with a single exception, are located in 
regions of heaviest negro population, and are fairly representative of other cities 
containing large numbers of negroes. 
The data, obtained were published in the May Bulletin of the United States Depart- 
ment of Labor, and cover so wide a range of useful information that only a few 
things can be pointed out here. 
Referring to the tables of this Bulletin, we find one noticeable fact in Table 3, 
namely, that the size of colored families is much smaller than is commonly supposed, 
the average being 4.17 persons. 
Tables 5 and 6 § giving household conditions by families—the average persons per 
sleeping room and the number of rooms per family—show that the “general belief 
that the tenements and houses occupied by colored people are greatly overcrowded 
is not founded on facts. These tables do not show that any great overcrowding 
exists, on the whole, although for certain indivitlual families and groups the aver- 
ages are somewhat larger. It also appears that the average number of living rooms 
is much lar; ‘ger than has been thought to be the case. An av erage of 2.22 persons 
to asleeping room in Atlanta, 2.44 persons in Nashville, and 1.96 persons in Cam- 
bridge, and 2.05 persons in all the other cities covered by the investigation, is an 
unexpected and important showing, and reverses tho idea that the number of fami- 
lies having but one room each for all purposes was very large and was the rule 
instead of the exception. Out of a total of 1,137 families investigated only 117, or 
10.29 per cent, had but one room each for their uso for all purposes. 
Table 7, giving number of families and means of support, shows a large proportion 
of females who either support families unaided or who contribute to the support of 
families. 
Of the male heads only 26.7 per cent were able to support their families without 
assistance from oth:r members. Of the 1,137 families 650, or 57.17 per cent, were 
supported wholly or in part by female heads. 
In comparison with white female heads of families and those contributing to 
family support there is quite a large excess on the part of colored women. 
This table calls attention to the enforced absence of mothers from their homes 
and the daily abandonment, by these mothers who are compelled to aid in earning 
the family support, of their young children to the evil associations, the temptations, 
and vicious liberty of the alleys, courts, and slums. 
To attempt to prove from the showing of this table that negro men are unwill- 
ing-to support their families and that they are lazy and shiftless would be unfair. 
Careful inquiry by a number of the investigators indicates very strongly that the 
comparatively small support given by these men to their families is not due to unwill- 
ingness, but to their inability to get work as readily and constantly as the women. 
At the South white men refuse to work at the bench, in the mill, and at other employ- 
ments with colored men, who for this reason are denied work, and therefore unable 
to earn means with which to support their families. 
This fact was found to exist in the city of Cambridge, where a large per cent of 
the men in the hundred families investigated, in reply to an inquiry, said that they 
had been refused work because they were colored, and 1 number of them said that 
they were unable to follow their trades, but had to ‘‘job around” with unsteady 
employment for the same reason,

  EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 2303 
The women in these families find steady employment as domestic servants and 
laundresses, and at the South find but little competition from white women. 
Tho investigation gives a great many data on this industrial side ef the question, 
which want of space will not now allow us to consider. 
Tables 8 and 9, giving the number and per cent of persons sick during the year 
and the number and per cent of deaths during the past five years by causes, show that 
the diseases most fatal to the colored people are consumptionand pneumonia, While 
the average length of time of sickness from it is short, malarial fever is shown to be 
one of the most prevalent diseases. Rheumatism is also shown to be quite prevalent. 
Both of these diseases, as well as typhoid fever and pneumonia, may to a great 
extent be kept in abeyance by the observance of hygienic rules and a proper care 
of the health. 
In the 100 Cambridge families it was found that many of the men work in the water 
department, and after the day’s work eat the evening meal without changing their 
damp clothing, often going to sleep in their chairs for an hour or more and then 
going to a lodge or “‘society meeting,” remaining not infrequently until 11 and 12 
o’clock. 
These tables also show that the differenco between the death rate of the white and 
colored people from diarrhea, diphtheria, scarlet fever, malarial fever, and typhoid 
fever, all diseases chiefly affected by environment, is very slight. 
Table 10, giving sickness by sanitary condition of houses, shows that while sani- 
ary conditions have a very important bearing, they are not important enough to 
account for the difference of per cent in the death rate between the white and colored 
ople. 
Breas caution must be observed in making deductions from this table. While it 
is intended to show the bearing of sanitary conditions on the health of the com- 
munity, the results obtained arenot conclusive. It would becrroneous, for instance, 
to attribute to bod sanitary conditions the increased amount of sickness in families, 
and lexwve out of consideration such factors as irregular habits, indifference to healthy 
living quarters, and the intimate relation between poverty and ill health. 
By reference to the table it will be seen that the number of persons sick in Atlanta 
was 163 out of a total of 577, or 28.25 per cent, where the light and air were good; and 
that out of 367 persons living where the light and air were bad, 120, or 32.70 per cent, 
were sick, a difference of only 15 per cent between houses with good and bad condi- 
tions as to light and air. 
One hundred and twenty-eight persons living in houses with good light and air 
lost 5,819 days by sickness, or an average of 45.46 days each; while 102, or 26 persons 
less, lost, under bad conditions of light and air, only 4,361 days, or an average of 
42.75 days each, a difference of 6 per cent, the average days of sickness being more 
in houses with good light and air than in those where the light and air were bad. 
This table further shows that out of 537 persons living in Atlanta in houses with 
good ventilation 153, or 28.49 per cent, were sick during the year, losing, for the 
124 reporting, 5,927 days, or an average of 47.80 days each; while out of 427 persons 
living in houses with bad ventilation 154, or 36 per cent, were sick during the year, 
133 of whom lost 6,050 days, or an average of 45.49 days each, a difference of only 26 
per cent between the per cent of persons sick where ventilation was good and where 
it was bad, the average number of days again being greater for those under good 
conditions than for those under bad. 
Table 15, giving general description of houses, shows that a large proportion of 
the houses occupied by the 1,137 families were wooden structures, detached and 
located in neighborhoods of fair character. Of the 1,031 houses but 43 had bath- 
rooms, and 183 had _water-closets, 95 of which were in the Cambridge houses. In 
Atlanta and Cambridge the houses with bad outside sanitary conditions predomi- 
nated. In all the other cities the houses with good outside sanitary conditions pre- 
dominated, the latter being greatly in excess for the entire territory covered. 
This paper may be summarized as follows: 
First. All the data in the investigation have been gathered by intelligent colored 
men and women living in the communities covered. These investigators were not 
hindered by obstacles which make it difficult for a white man to get accurate infor- 
mation of the family life, habits, and character of the colored people. These colored 
investigators can not be charged with prejudice and designs against the interests of 
the colored people. For these reasons their work is thought to be mere than usually

Second. Overcrowding in tenements and houses eccupied by colored people does 
not exist to any great extent, and is less than was supposed. 
Third. In comparison with white women, an excess of colored women support 
their families entirely, or contribute to the family support, by occupations which 
take them much of their time from home, to the neglect of their children. 
Fourth, Environment and the sanitary condition of houses are not chiefly respon- 
sible for the excessive mortality among colored people.

Fifth. Ignorance and disregard of the laws of health are responsible for a large 
proportion of this excessive mortality. 
SociaL AND PHYSICAL PROGRESS.! 
The study of vital statistics is one of the most important subjects that can engage 
the attention. The death rate, taken in connection with the birth rate, determines 
the natural increase or decrease of population, the growth or decline of a people, 
and the strength of nations. Dr. William Farr, late registrar-general of births, 
deaths, and marriages in England, states the whole matter in the following lan- 
* guage: ‘‘There is a relation betwixt death, health, and energy of body and mind. 
There is a relation betwixt death, birth, and marriage. There is a relation betwixt 
death and national primacy; numbers turn the tide in the struggle of population, 
and the most mortal die out. There is a relation betwixt the forms of death and 
moral excellence or infamy.” 
It has been known for a number of years to health officers and students of vital 
statistics that the death rate of the colored people was larger than that of the white 
people; that the colored people were dying in larger numbers in proportion to the 
colored population than the white people were in proportion to the white popula- 
tion. Of late years these facts have become known to most intelligent persons, and 
great interest attaches to the degree of the excess of the colored death rate and to 
the causes of it. 
This paper will deal with the vital statistics of the cities of Atlanta, Ga.; Balti- 
more, Md.; Charleston, 8. C.; Memphis, Tenn., and Richmond, Va. Each of these 
cities contains a large colored population, surrounded by social, economic, and moral 
conditions such as exist in other cities where colored people are congregated in con- 
siderable numbers, if Philadelphia is excepted. The cities selected are therefore 
thoroughly representative for the purpose in hand, and the conditions found to pre- 
vailin them may be fairly presumed to prevail in the other cities having a large 
population of colored people. 
The average annual death rate per 1,000 of the living population in these five cities 
for the fifteen years from 1881 to 1895 was 20.74 for the whites and 36.13 for the 
colored, showing a percentage of excess for the colored of 73.8. 
The average annual death rate per 1,000 by race for each of the five cities under 
consideration for the past fourteen or fifteen years is as follows:

Richmond (1881-1895) 20.73 | 38. 02 83.4 
         
An inspection of the table just given shows that the highest death rate among the 
colored is in Charleston (which is also true as to the whites) and that the lowest 
death rate among the colored is in atemp nds, the lowest among the whites being in 
Atlanta. Comparing the white and co. ored death rates, it is to be seen that the 
greatest excess of colored over white is in Charleston, where it reaches 90 per cent, 
the excess in Atlanta being 87.6 per cent and that in Richmond 83.4 per cent. The 
least excess is found in Memphis, which is 51.3 per cent, Baltimore having 58.1 per 
cent. These figures seem to justify the conclusion that the worst physical condi- 
tions among the colored people are to be found in Charleston, Atlanta, and Rich- 
mond and the best in Memphis and Baltimore. 
Having found the average death rates of the two races in these five cities for the 
past fourteen or fifteen years, and having compared them with each other and drawn 
a conclusion as to the relative physical conditions of the colored populations in the 
cities under consideration, it will conduce to a better understanding and a fuller 
knowledge of these conditions to divide the fourteen or fifteen years which this 
investigation covers into three periods as nearly equal as possible. By pursuing 
this method we shall be able, in a measure, to decide whether the physical condition 
of the colored people is better or worse in 1894 or 1895 than in 1880 or 1881.

The tabular statement contains, in addition to the average annual death rate, the 
percentage of the excess of the colored death rate. Lest the percentages of excess 
mislead somebody, it is necessary to explain that, in comparing the three periods 
they merely show whether or not the colored death rate has decreased as rapidly as 
the white death rate, and not the actual increase or decrease of the colored death 
rate. To illustrate: Comparing the second and third periods in Richmond, it is to 
be seen that the percentage of excess for the second period is 81.7 per cent and for 
the third period 89.5 per cent. Without looking at the matter carefully the conclu- 
sion is likely to be drawn that the colored death rate is greater for the third period 
than for the second, when, as a matter of fact, it is less, the rates being 38.83! for the 
second and 34.91 for the third. 
An inspection of the above table shows that there has been a constant decrease in 
the colored death rate from period to period in Atlanta, Memphis, and Richmond. 
In Atlanta the colored death rate for the first period is 37.96, for the second 33.41, 
and for the third 32.76; in Memphis 43.01 for the first period, 29.35 for the second, 
and 21.11 for the third and in Richmond 40.34 for the first period, 38.83 for the 
second, and 34.91 for the third. While Baltimore and Charleston do not show the 
constant decrease from period to period noted in the other cities, they do show a lower 
death rate for the third period than for the first, the death rates in Baltimore being 
36.15 for the first period, 30.52 for the second, and 31.47 for the third, and those in 
Charleston 44.08 for the first period, 46.74 for the second, and 41.43 for the third. 
Memphis shows the greatest improvement, the average death rate at the end of the 
third period being 50.9 per cent lower than at the end of the first, and Charleston 
shows the least improvement—6 per cent. In Atlanta the improvement is 13.9 per 
cent, in Richmond 13.4 per cent, and in Baltimore 12.9 per cent. 
Of the five cities with which this paper deals but two have a registration of 
births—Baltimore and Charleston. Richmond had such a registration, but it was 
discontinued some years ago. The registrations of Baltimore and Charleston are 
admittedly incomplete. No view of the vital statistics of a community is complete 
without a knowledge of its birth rate. The birthrate is closely related to the death 
rate. The natural increase of population depends upon the excess of the birth rate 
over the death rate. It would be highly interesting to know what the birth rate of 
the colored population in the five cities under consideration is. Is it as great as 
the death rate? Is it greater than the death rate? These questions can not be 
answered satisfactorily because the health reports do not supply the information. 
The United States census of 1890 gives the colored birth rate of the United States 
as 29.07 per 1,000, but owing to the incompleteness of the records of births by 
the municipal and State authorities, these figures are not reliable and are probably 
much too small. Four European countries have birth rates which exceed the 
colored death rate in the cities that we have under consideration. In view of the 
well-known fecundity of the negro race, it is fair to infer that his birth rate is cer- 
tainly as high as that of the Italian, the German, the Austrian, or the Hungarian. 
If this is so, then the death rate in these cities has not reached the point where 
population begins to decrease. It is well-nigh useless to pursue this branch of the 
subject further, because of the lack of data. 
Having established the fact that the average colored death rate for the past four- 
teen or fifteen years in the five cities is 73.8 per cent in excess of the white death 
rate in the same cities for the same period, and having shown, by dividing these 
years into three equal periods and comparing the rates of previous with succeeding 
periods, that the colored death rate shows an improvement over fifteen years ago, it 
remains to set forth the causes of this excessive mortality. 
The principal causes of the excessive mortality of the colored people are the same 
in all the cities, therefore it will serve our purpose to know the average death rate 
of the three cities, Charleston; Memphis, and Richmond, combined, for a period of 
    
  
1 The death rate is generally expressed in terms of 1,000. ‘Tho phrase ‘‘rate of 38.83” means that there were thirty-eight and eighty-three ono-hundredths deaths per 1,000 of population. For brevity, the words ‘‘per thousand ” are omitted.

     fifteen years for certain classes of diseases, and to give in full the same facts con- 
cerning Atlanta. The table which follows shows for Charleston, Memphis, and 
Richmond, combined, the average death rate per 10,000 by specified causes for a 
period of fifteen years, from 1881 to 1895: 
  
    
                
    Per cent: Disease. White. | Colored. | excess of colored. 
Consumption and pneumonia. 32.76 | 75.48 130. 4 Typhoid, malarial, and scarle! , 20.16 | 26.22 Cholera infantum, convulsions, and still-born 14.87 | 39.43 Scrofula and syphilis. 0.81 4.72         
@ These death rates for specified causes are per 10,000. 
It is to be seen from the table above that for all classes of diseases the colored 
death rate exceeds the white. The greatest excess is found under scrofula and 
syphilis, where it is 482.7 per cent in excess of the white death rate. The next 
greatest excess is due to infantile diseases—cholera infantum, convulsions, and still- 
born—the excess being 165.1 per cent. The third greatest excess is due to pulmo- 
nary diseases, and is seen to be 130.4 per cent. We seo also that the least disparity 
between the white and the colored death rate is found under the group of diseases 
most affected by environment, including typhoid and malarial fevers and diphtheria, 
where the excess is only 30 per cent. As to syphilis and scrofula, itis to be observed 
that the number of deaths is small. The white death rate during fifteen years in 
Charleston, Memphis, and Richmond has been Jess than 1 per 10,000 of the popu- 
lation, while the colored was somewhat less than 5. The per cent of the excess 
of the colored over the white is, however, startling, and furnishes much food for 
reflection as to the morals of the colored people. 
The two principal causes of the excessive mortality of the colored people are pul- 
monary diseases—consumption and pneumonia—and infant mortality. The exces- 
sive prevalence of consumption and pneumonia among colored people is brought out 
very plainly in the foregoing table, where the excess in these cities is shown to be 
130.4 per cent. 
The following table, containing the total average annual number of deaths and

tion of race, will serve to show the extent of the infant mortality among colored

There is an enormous waste of child life among both races, not only in the cities 
under consideration, but in all cities. But from the data at hand the conclusion i 
justified that the mortality among colored children is not alarmingly in excess o: 
the mortality among white children, unless it be for children under 2 years of age. 
The figures which we havo presented on this subject show that the mortality amon, 
children of both races has decreased constantly since 1881 in Atlanta, Charleston, 
and Memphis.

EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 2307 
Of the diseases which are excessively prevalent among colored people the most 
important, and the one which should be the occasion of the greatest alarm, is con- 
sumption. We have seen already that consumption and pneumonia are among the 
causes of excessive mortality of the colored people, the excess per cent of Charleston, 
Memphis, and Richmond being 130.4, 
The table following shows the rate per 10,000 of deaths from consumption in all 
the cities investigated:

It is to be seen that in all of the cities the death rate for consumption is high 
among the colored people, the lowest rate being 34.74 per 10,000, in Richmond, and 
the highest 72.20, in Charleston. The greatest disparity between the white and the 
colored death rate for this cause is also in Charleston, where the excess per cent of 
the colored is as high as 239.5. The important fact must not be lost sight of that 
the death rate from this cause has constantly decreased in all the cities except 
Charleston, and in Charleston the death rate for the period 1890-1894 is lower than 
for the period 1881-1884. There is reason, however, for great concern and anxiety as 
to the excessive prevalence of this disease among the colored people. Unless checked 
and reduced to a normal state, it may in the course of years be a deciding factor in 
the ultimate fate of the race, The prevalence of tubercular and scrofulous diseases— 
consumption, scrofula, syphilis, and leprosy—has caused the weaker races of the 
earth to succumb before the rising tide of the Christian civilization. The Carib of 
the West Indies, the noble red man of these shores, the natives of the Sandwich 
Islands, and the aborigines of Australia and New Zealand have all disappeared or 
been greatly reduced in numbers as the result of the ravages, of these diseases, It 
should be an object of first importance, then, to get control of these diseases before 
they reach the point where control is impossible. 
It will be of itterest to know somewhat in detail the physical condition of the 
population in Atlanta for the fourteen years from 1882 to 1895, and the tables which 
follow set forth quite fully this fact.

It is seen that the death rate of the colored population, though greatly in excess of 
that of the white, has constantly decreased, the average death rate per 1,000 for the 
first period being 37.96, for the second 33.41, and for the third 32.76. Relatively, as 
compared with the whites, the death rate of the colored shows much improvement. 
Though the percentage of excess of colored for the third period is greater than that 
for the second, the percentage for both of these periods shows a marked decrease 
from that of the first period. 
The following tables show for three periods, 1882 to 1885, 1886 to 1890, and 1891 to

  aIncluding deaths from cholera infantum and stillbirths. 
It is observed that in all these groups of causes the colored death rate has de- 
creased from period to period, except for consumption and pneumonia, where the 
death rate for the period 1891-1895 is greater than for the period 1886-1890, though 
slightly less than for the period 1882-1885. 
The statistics presented in the various tables which this paper contains, viewed 
candidly and dispassionately, show results favorable to the physical improvement 
of the colored race. If the mortality rate had remained stationary for a period of 
fifteen years, it would have been a lasting evidence of the physical strength and 
endurance of the race. But we have shown that the rate has decreased in that 
period, and that, too, as is well known, in the face of hard, exacting, and oppres- 
sive social and economic conditions. When all of the facts in the colored man’s case 
are taken into consideration, the wonder is, not that the death rate is as high as it 
is, but that it is not even higher. The history of weak and inferior races shows that 
they begin to decrease in number after one generation’s contact with Anglo-Saxon 
civilization. The native population of the Sandwich Islands a hundred years ago} 
was estimated to be 100,000. The latest census taken on the islands shows the nativ 
population to be 35,000. We do not witness this decay and decrease in numbers in| 
the colored race anywhere in the Western Hemisphere. 
In studying any phase of negro life in the United States, the fact must be kep#j 
 
-P-A-G-E-1180
EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 2309 
constantly in view that the negro has been subjected to degrading and blasting 
slavery for more than two centuries. While slavery did its victims a great wrong 
in depriving them of the fruits of their toil, it did them a greater wrong in denying 
them opportunities for moral and mental improvement. Those who sit in judgme 6 
upon the negro and study his frailties and shortcomings must not forget these 
previous conditions. 
To recapitulate, it has been shown— 
First. That the colored death rate exceeds the white, the excess averaging for five 
cities, during a period of fifteen years, 73.8 per cent. 
Second. That the death rate of the colored population in five cities is lower for the 
period 1890-1895 than for the period 1881-1885. 
Third. That the principal causes of the excessive mortality among the colored 
people of five cities are pulmonary diseases and infant mortality. 
Fourth. That the least disparity between the white and colored death rates is for 
those diseases due to un wholesome sanitary conditions— typhoid, malarial and scar- 
let fevers, diphtheria, and diarrhea. 
This last fact, that the excessive death rate of the colored people does not arise 
from diseases due to environment, is of vast importance. If poor houses, unhealthy 
localities, bad sewerage, and defective plumbing were responsible for their high 
death rate, there would be no hope of reducing the death rate until either the col- 
ored people became wealthy, or philanthropic persons erected sanitary houses, or 
municipalities made appropriations to remove these conditions. But since the 
excessive death rate is not due to these causes, there is reason for the belief that it 
may be reduced without regard to the present’ economic conditions of the colored 
people. 
THE PHYSICAL CONDITION OF THE RACE.! 
* * * Tf the colored people in our larger towns are bent upon living near the 
center of the city, they can not rent or buy property, except in the less desirable or 
abandoned parts. But it is not necessity, it is only convenience that leads them to 
live over stables, in dark, damp cellars, and on back alleys in the midst of stench 
and putrefaction. They can, if they would, go to the suburbs, where they can get 
better accommodations for less money. I have been in families in Nashville ranging 
from seven to ten living on a back alley with a rivulet of filth running before the 
door of the one room in which they bathed and ate and slept and died. Two miles 
farther out all of these families might have secured for the same money shanties of 
two and three rooms, with purer air and water, and had a garden spot besides. Among 
the colored people convenience to the heart of the city often overrides considerations 
of health, and that the white people offer them hotbeds of disease for homes is no 
excuse for their taking them. It is better to live in the suburbs than to die in the 
city. The negro is induced, but not forced, to.accept the bad accommodations of 
down-town life. Apart from this apparent exception in the matter of rented houses, 
no race discrimination affects in the least the negro’s physical condition; and it is 
for this very reason that I am hopeful of a change for the better in the vital statistics 
of our people, If the large death rate, the small birth rate, the susceptibility to 
disease, and the low vitality of the race were due to causes outside of our control, I 
could see nothing before us but the “blackness of darkness forever;” but because 
the colored people themselves are responsible for this sad state of affairs, it is to be 
expected that time and education will correct it. 
The conclusions which I shall draw in this paper are based largely upon my study 
of the problem in Nashville, 
In the first place, then, the excess of colored deaths over white is due almost 
entirely to constitutional diseases and infant mortality. According to health statis- 
tics, the constitutional diseases which are mainly responsible for our large death 
rate are pulmonary consumption, scrofula, and syphilis, all of which are alike in 
being tuberculous. A large number of the colored convicts in our State prison at 
Nashville are cousumptives or syphilitics. Out of 92 deaths in a certain territory ix. 
Nashville, 19 deaths, or over 20 per cent, were due to consumption. The other 73 
deaths were due to thirty-five different causes. In the recent Atlanta investiga- 
tion, according to the mortality report of Cambridge, Mass., consumption was the 
cause of 15 per cent of the deaths.

Alarming as are the facts set forth in the preceding table, they are not the whole 
truth. They would be occasion for serious concern if the races were numerically 
equal, but when we remember that the colored people of Nashville are only three- 
fifths as numerous as the whites, it is all the morestartling. Forthe year 1895,when 
82 white deaths from consumption occurred in the city of Nashville, there ought to 
have been only 49 colored, whereas there really were 218, or nearly four and one-half 
times as many as there ought to have been. It is an occasion of serious alarm when 
37 per cent of the whole people are responsible for 72 per cent of the deaths from 
consumption. 
Deaths among colored people from pulmonary diseases seem to be on the increase 
throughont the South. During the period 1882-1885, the excess of colored deaths 
from consumption for the city of Memphis was 90.80 per cent. For the period 1891- 
1895, the excess had arisen to over 137 per cent. For the period of 1886-1890, the 
excess of colored deaths from consumption and pneumonia for the city of Atlanta 
was 139 per cent. For the period 1891-1895, it had arisen to nearly 166 per cent. 
From these facts it would appear that pulmonary consumption is the “destroying 
angel” among us, and yet I am told that before the war this dread disease was vir- 
tually unknown among the slaves. Fortunately, Charleston, S.C., kept even before 
the war the mortality statistics of the colored people, and, consequently, we are 
able to ascertain with some accuracy how their death rate from consumption before 
the war compares with their death rateafterwards. What are the facts m the case? 
From 1822 to 1848 the colored death rate from consumption was a trifle less than 
the white. Since 1865 it has been considerably greater, and is still increasing. 
According to F. L, Hoffman, the white mortality from that cause has decreased since 
the war 134 per 100,000. The colored mortality has increased over 234 per 100,000.! 
The question arises, How do we account for this change? Is it because the negro 
is inherently more susceptible to pulmonary diseases, or is it because of his changed 
environment—his different social conditions? If his tendency to consumption is due 
to his inherent susceptibility, what was it that held it in check until after the war? 
It seems that this fact alone is sufficient to fix the responsibility upon the conditions 
which have arisen since emancipation. Mr. F. L. Hoffman claims that the negro’s 
lungs weigh 4 ounces less than a white man’s, and that though his normal chest 
measure is greater, his lung capacity is less; and that here we have a cause for the 
negro’s tendency to consumption which no environment, however favorable, can 
affect. Even if this be a fact, it is hard to see how it began to operate as a cause 
of consumption only since the war. 
Let us turn for the present to another cause of the excessive mortality among us, 
namely, the increased prevalence of scrofula and venereal diseases. For the period 
1882-1885 the colored death rate in Memphis from serofula and syphilis was 205.8 per 
cent in excess of that among the whites, but from 1891 down to the present time the 
excess has been 298 per cent. For the period 1893-1895 there were in the city of 
Nashville 8 white deaths from scrofula and syphilis and 35 colored. In proportion to 
the population, there ought to have been only5. Of course allowance must be made 
for the fact that, on account of the scandal and disgrace, white physicians are reluc- 
tant to report white deaths from these causes, whereas such motives rarely, if ever, 
influence them in reporting colored deaths. 
According to the May bulletin of the Department of Labor, out of 1,090 colored 
people canvassed this year in the city of Nashville, 18 were suffering from scrofula 
and syphilis. One whose attention has not been called to the matter has no concep- 
tion of the prevalence of these diseases among the negroes of Nashville. I have 
looked for it in both racesas I have walked the streets of my city, and to come across 
the loathsome disease in the colored passers-by is not an uncommon occurrence. This 
state of affairs can be accounted for when I tell you that there is probably no cityin 
this country where prostitution among colored people is more rampant and brazen, 
and where abandoned colored women are more numerous or more public in their 
shameful traffic. 
In the families canvassed by me this year, among 50 sufferers from rheumatism, 8 
were so badly crippled as to be bedridden invalids. When we consider the fact that 
some forms of rheumatism are syphilitic in their origin, and that in these same fami- 
lies there were 18 suffering from scrofula and syphilis, it would appear that venereal 
poisoning was responsible for a considerable share of the rheumatism. 
There is one obstacle to the race’s reproducing itself that has some connection with 
venereal diseases, and hence I speak of it now. Irefer to the enormous amount of 
stillbirths and infant mortality prevalent everywhere among colored people. For 
the period of 1893-1895, the still and the premature births in the city of Nashville 
were 272 for the white and 385 for the colored; or, in proportion to the population, 
two and one-third times as many as there ought to have been. This relative state 
of affairs obtains in Memphis and Atlanta, and in all the large cities of the South.

  EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 2311 
From the health reports of all our large Southern cities we learn that a considerable 
amount of our infant mortality is due to inanition, infantile debility, and infantile 
marasmus. Now, what is the case in regard to these diseases? The fact is that they 
are not diseases at all, but merely the names of symptoms due to enfeebled constitu- 
tions and congenital diseases, inherited from parents suffering from the effects of 
sexual immorality and debauchery. Translated into common speech, they are noth- 
ing more than infant starvation, infant weakness, and infant wasting away, the cause 
of which is that the infants’ parents before them have not given them a fighting 
chance for life. According to Hoffman, over 50 per cent of the negro children born 
in Richmond, Va., die before they are 1 year old. 
The number of still and premature births among us is a matter of great alarm, not 
only because it seriously interferes with the numerical increase of the race, but 
because it involves the fecundity, the health, and even the moral character of large 
numbers of our women. Thesupport of the family often falls very heavily upon our 
poor washerwomen; and since they find it hard to get the husks to feed and the rags 
to clothe their already large number of little folks, living in one room like stock, 
rather than to add to their burden they resort to crime. An official on the Nashville 
board of health, who is also proprietor of a drug store, tells me that he is astonished 
at the number of colored women who apply at his store for *rugs with a criminal 
purpose in view. : 
The sixteen Atlanta groups in the recent investigation showed that the female 
heads of families are considerably in excess of the male, and out of 324 families 31 
were wholly supported by the mother, and 205 were supported by the mother alto- 
gether or in part. In such social conditions as these, where the burden of bread 
winning is borne largely, and often altogether, by the mother of the household, it 
is not surprising that poor laboring women, who are ignorant of its ruinous effects 
upon both health and character, should resort to prenatal infanticide. 
The average family for the eighteen cities covered by our recent investigation 
numbers only 4.1, which means that in these eighteen cities the race is doing barely 
more than reproducing itself. The large colored families of 1 few decades ago are 
becoming more and more scarce. I know @ grandmother who was the proud mother 
of over a dozen children; the daughter could boast of nine; and not one of several 
granddaughters, though married for a number of years, is the mother of more than 
one child, This family is but an illustration of many others just like it. Such 
facts go to show that the negro is no longer the “prolific animal” that he once was 
termed. The race, like the women of whom Paul once wrote to Timothy, must be 
“saved through childbearing.” 
Itake it thatthe excess of infant mortality from cholera infantum and conyul- 
sions means nothing *aore than that the negro mothers do not know so well how to 
feed and care for their offspring. They need instruction in infant dietetics and 
baby culture. 
I have now covered the ground to which our excessive death rate is mainly due, 
namely, pulmonary diseases, especially consumption and pneumonia, scrofula, vene- 
real diseases, and infant mortality. If we eliminate these diseases, our excessive 
death rate will be a thing of the past. 
Let us now inquire, What is there in the negro’s social condition that is responsi- 
ble for the prevalence of these diseases, and the consequent mortality? In the first 
place, then, be it known by all men that we to-day in this conference assembled are 
not the enemies of our people because we tell them the truth. We shall know the 
truth, and the truth shall make us free, not only from the bondage of sin, but from 
vicious social conditions and consequent physical death. Sanitary regulations and 
the social reconstruction of Israel formed a large part of Moses’ religious duty, and 
why may it not of ours? 
While I do not depreciate sanitary regulations and a knowledge of hygienic laws, 
Iam convinced that the sine qua non of a change for the better in the negro’s phys- 
ical condition is a higher social morality. Ido not believe that his poverty or his 
relation to the white people presents any real impediment to his health and physical 
development. Without going into the reasons for it, it is well known that the poor 
laboring classes often enjoy better health, are freer from disease, have larger fami- 
lies, and live longer lives than the rich. 
Iam convinced that for the causes of the black man’s low vitality, his suscepti- 
bility to disease, and his enormous death rate we must look to those social condi- 
tions which he creates for himself. What are they? I have already referred to the 
social causes of our excessive infant mortality, namely, the frequency with which 
the partial or the entire maintenance of the household devolves upon the mother; 
and especially the impaired chance for life which a Jebauched and immoral parent- 
age bequeaths to childhood. The infants in their graves will rise up in judgment 
against this evil and adulterous generation and condemn it. 
The constitutional diseases which are responsible for our unusual mortality are 
often traceable to enfeebled constitutions broken down by sexual immoralities,
-P-A-G-E-1183
2312 EDUCATION REPORT, 1896-97. 
This is frequently the source of even pulmonary consumption, which disease is 
to-day the black man’s scourge. 
According to Hoffman, over 25 per cent of the negro children born in Washington 
City are admittedly illegitimate, According to a writer quoted in Black America, 
“fin one county of Mississippi there were during twelve months 300 marriage 
licenses taken out in the county clerk's office for white people. According to the 
proportion of population there should have been in the same time 1,200 or more for 
negroes. There were actually taken out by colored people just 3.” James Anthony 
Froude asserts that 70 per cent of the negroes in the West Indies are born in ille- 
psEmASy. Mr. Smeeton claims that “in spite of the increase of education there 
has been no decrease of this social cancer.” My attention has been called to a 
resort in Nashville, within less than two blocks of the public square, where a large 
number of abandoned women and profligate men often congregate in the under- 
ground basement, which is lighted anal ventilated only through the pavement 
grating; and there in debauchery and carousal they make the night hideous until 
almost morning. What are they sowing but disease, and what can they reap but 
death i 
It is true that much of the moral laxity which exists among us to-day arose out 
of slavery. It is due to a system which whipped women, which dispensed with 
the institution of marriage, which separated wives from their husbands and 
assigned them to other men, which ruthlessly destroyed female virtue, and which 
made helpless women the abject tools of their masters. This is the correct explana- 
tion of our social status to-day, but to explain it is not to excuse it. It is no longer 
our misfortune, as it was before the war; it is our sin, the wages of which is our 
excessive number of deaths. Always and everywhere, moral leprosy means physical 
death. Wherever the colored people are guilty of the immoralities of which James 
Anthony Froude and W. L. Clowes of the London Times accuse them, if they con- 
tinue in them they will be destroyed by them, root and branch. Rome was destroyed 
because the Empire had no mothers, and Babylon was blotted out because she was 
the “ mother of harlots.” 
A few years ago I said, im a sermon at Fisk University, that wherever the Anglo- 
Saxon comes into contact with an inferior race the inferior race invariably goes to 
the wall. I called attention to the fact that, in spite of humanitarian and philan- 
thropic efforts, the printing press, the steam engine, and the electric motor in the 
hands of the Anglo-Saxon were exterminating the inferior races more rapidly and 
more surely than shot and shell and bayonet. I mentioned a number of races that 
have perished, not because of destructive wars and pestilence, but because they 
were unable to live in the environment of a nineteenth century civilization; races 
whose destruction was not due to a persecution that came to them from without, 
but to a lack of moral stamina within; races that perished in spite of the humani- 
tarian and philanthropic efforts that were put forth to save them. 
To that utterance let me now add this thought: That where shot and shell and 
bayonet and the printing press and the steam engine and the electric motor have 
slain their thousands, licentious men, unchaste women, and impure homes have slain 
their tens of thousands; and I speak the words of soberness and truth when I say 
that if the charges of sexual immoralities brought against us are true, unless there 
be wrought a social revolution among us the handwriting of our destruction even 
now may be seen on the wall. The history of nations teaches us that neither war 
nor famine nor pestilence exterminates them so completely and rapidly as do sexual 
vices. 
If the cause of our excessive death rate be, in its ultimate analysis, moral rather 
than sanitary, then this fact ought to appear not only in our vital, but in our crim- 
inal statistics as well. Professor Starr, of Chicago University, claims that in the 
State of Pennsylvania, where there is little opportunity to assert that the courts are 
‘prejudiced against colored criminals, though the negroes form only 2 per cent of the 
population, yet they furnish 16 per cent of the male prisoners and 34 per cent of the 
female. The race has such great privileges in Chicago and it is dealt with so fairly 
and justly that the colored people themselves have denominated it the ‘Negroes’ 
Heaven;” and yet, secording: to Professor Starr, while the negroes form only 1} per 
cent of the population of Chicago they furnish 10 per cent of the arrests. [ am 
convinced that the immorality which accounts for these criminal conditions is also 
responsible for the race’s physical status; and if we are to strike at the root of the 
matter, it will not be at sanitary regulations, but at social reconstruction and moral 
regeneration.

and taught by Valentine Haiiy at Paris, France, in 1774. Schools for the blind were 
soon established in England, Russia, and other European countries, the most noted 
of these schools in foreign countries being at Paris, Amsterdam, Vienna, Berlin, 
Copenhagen, and London. Massachusetts was the first State in this country to 
organize a school for the education of the blind. The school was established by the 
legislature in 1829 and was located at Boston. Schools for the blind are now in suc- 
cessful operation in Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, 
West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Kentucky, Ten- 
nessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Ohio, Indiana, Ilinois, 
Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas, Montana, Colo- . 
rado, Washington, Oregon, and California. 
In all of the State public schools for the blind in the above-mentioned States 
there are three departments, viz, literary, musical, and industrial. In the literary 
departments the courses of study are kindergarten, reading, writing, spelling, 
language, grammar, rhetoric, literature, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, geography, 
history, civics, physiology, physical geography, drawing, and modeling.

In 1879 Congress appropriated $250,000 as a perpetual fund, the interest of which is 
set aside to purchase suitable books and apparatus to be distributed annually among 
the various institutions for the blind in the United States. The American Printing 
House at Louisville, Ky., has charge of this fund, and prints annually, for the use 
of the schools for the blind, books and maps to be used as text-books.

CHAPTER XLVI 
STATISTICS OF REFORM SCHOOLS, 
Boys and girls are no longer sent to the reform schools for the purpose of receiving 
punishment, but to be educated and taught useful trades. The aim of the reform 
school is to protect the helpless, to train the incorrigible to obedience, and to reform 
those who have wandered from the right way by education, by wholesome restraint, 
by moral and religious influences, and by the formation of industrial habits.

instructors and 21,243 pupils in the school departments and 11,757 pupils in the 
industrial departments. The total number of inmates reported was 23,696. The value 
of grounds and buildings was $16,319,017. The total expenditures were $4,150,761, 
of which amount $604,661 was for buildings and improvements and $3,546,100 for sup-

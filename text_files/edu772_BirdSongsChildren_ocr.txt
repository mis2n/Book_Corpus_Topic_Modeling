PREFATORY NOTE 
Keenly appreciative of the kind words which have greeted the 
publication of “Twenty-Five Bird Songs for Children,” the author 
is encouraged to add to the list of birds therein treated, this second 
volume of twenty songs. 
With the woods, fields and marshes overflowing with suggestive 
melodies and calls which challenge the musical ear and creative 
imagination, there is no reason why we should not have songs about 
every bird which has a characteristic song or call-note. 
Miss Kitty Cheatham writes: “Some day we will have great 
inspirational music when composers go to the right sources for their 
inspiration.” ‘To what source should we go for inspiration as well 
as actual thematic material for the composition of Bird Songs for 
Children but the birds themselves, for where else in nature can we 
find music so like our own both in rhythm and melodic form? 
That these little songs may lead many to an actual acquaintance 
with the birds whose songs and calls are here used, and thus to a 
greater interest in bird life in general, is the sincere hope of the author.

BLUEBIRD 
If the bird lovers of our country should hold a popularity contest 
to determine which is the best loved bird, I verily believe that the 
Bluebird would carry off the honors. Not that he is the most useful 
bird, nor the most common, nor the most rare, for he is none of these; 
but his ways are so lovable, his coloring of blue and rose so exquisite, 
and his sweet little voice, one of the first to be heard in the Spring, 
brings so much cheer and promise, that we can readily appreciate 
Riley’s lines: 
And when that Bluebird sang, my heart 
Hopped out of bed with me. 
There is not much tune to his song; in fact, the six or eight notes 
are often rather indeterminate, but the charm lies in the quality of 
his voice, so remarkably soft and mellow. The phrase of three notes 
represented by the word ‘‘cheery”’ in this song, and often translated 
“purity,” is the one most frequently heard.

RUBY-CROWNED KINGLET 
The tiniest of them all with the exception of the Hummingbird, the Kinglet will, never- 
theless, stand on his own feet when vocal ability is in question. A voice so ethereal in quality, 
bubbling and sparkling as a rippling brook, it does, indeed, seem scarcely of this world. 
When first heard, the song seems very free in form, yet the repetitions show little variation 
in the melody. Several repeated notes on a very high pitch, then a drop of about a sixth where 
he pronounces the words “dear, dear, dear, dear,” followed by two or more scale-passages in 
rapid tempo, combine to produce one of the most fascinating songs to be heard during the entire 
springtime. ‘Then to see him flash his ruby crown fairly causes one to hold one’s breath. 
It will be noticed that the accompaniment of this song has been given more of the bird 
theme than has the voice-part. This is largely because the high tones of the piano are more 
uniaLve of this bird’s voice than are any tones that can be produced by the average human 
throat.

PHBE 
As suggested in the text of this song, the Phoebe and Wood Pewee are often confused be- 
cause of the similarity of their appearance. Their calls, however, are so unlike that when once 
heard there can be no question as to the identity of the bird. The Pheebe’s voice is strident 
in quality, and his oft-repeated, querulous call becomes in time quite exasperating; on the other 
hand the plaintive, appealing voice. of the Pewee is quite in keeping with the quiet restfulness of 
the deep wood where he is commonly: heard. 
Then, again, the high pitched, clear tones of the Chickadee, sounding quite a bit like the 
word “Pheebe,” are often mistakenly ascribed to the Phoebe. Contrasting thus the songs or 
rather the calls of these three birds will, it is hoped, assist the young bird student in his identifi- 
cation of them.

THE CHICKADEE’S CHRISTMAS CAROL 
The Chickadee is a great favorite with all bird lovers. He is so 
sociable a fellow, his voice is so cheering, and there is such an abun- 
dance of energy in his restless little body. In the wintertime especially 
is his presence appreciated, when the majority of our birds have 
gone where food is more plentiful. ‘The very fact, indeed, that food 
is scarce, tends to make the Chickadee more friendly, often inducing 
him to accept bits of bread or nut meats from the fingers of kindly 
folk. For this reason I have associated him with the Christmas 
season in this song. 
Fortunately, the custom of keeping food in a place which is 
convenient for birds during the winter months has become widespread 
in recent years. Why should we not do this, for the returns are great, 
and not alone from an economic standpoint, for the fellowship which 
it is possible for us to have with these little creatures brings a pleasure 
that is unique.

      TUFTED 'TITMOUSE AND SAPSUCKER 
There are three birds for which I have but little sympathy. The English Sparrow is an 
acknowledged offender on many counts, the Cowbird inspires contempt on account of his lazy, 
shiftless habits, and the Sapsucker seems to do more harm than good by girding young trees in 
his greediness for sap. However, even these birds may. be of some use; at any rate, the call of 
the Sapsucker, sounding so extremely like the mewing of a cat, helped me to make a story. 
The Titmouse, a cousin of the Chickadee, is a very different sort of chap. Moreover, he 
is quite musical, for in addition to his call, which suggests that of the Chickadee, he has the two 
very distinct themes used in this song. The “Peter” theme is almost invariably given on the 
two tones here used—f and d. Indeed, I am inclined to think that many birds possess the gift, 
so rare with us humans, called positive pitch. I do not recall that I have ever recorded a melody 
which on subsequent hearings from the same bird has possessed a different tonality from the one 
previously heard, except that in successive seasons I have occasionally noted a variation of a 
half-tone,

  INDIGO BUNTING 
It is a common saying that birds of brilliant plumage do not sing so well as the more plainly 
dressed ones. It is true that the Thrushes and the singing Sparrows have no bright colors, and 
that the Parrot and Peacock have disagreeable voices, but a little reflection will call to mind many 
beautiful birds which are also noted for their musical, ability. 
Not the least conspicuous among these is the Indigo Bunting, which, with the Cardinal and 
Rose-breasted Grosbeak, who are also good singers, belongs to the Sparrow family. His beautiful 
coat will invariably bring an exclamation of delight from the entranced beholder, while his voice 
is both pleasing in quality and of good volume. A glance at the themes of my song will give 
evidence of his ability as a melodist, though they do not by any means constitute the extent of 
his repertoire. As a matter of fact, his song is often indeterminate as to interval and difficult to 
represent on the staff, though this will give a suggestion as to his style.

DICKCISSEL 
The Dickcissel is one of the commonest of our summer birds, 
but I have found that comparatively few people are acquainted with 
him. Perhaps the reason is that his voice fits in so naturally and 
unobtrusively with the droning of cicadas and other sounds of a 
summer day that one is scarcely aware of it. 
His is not a beautiful song; merely the chanting of the words 
“dick-dick-dick-cissel-cissel’’ on or near the notes which I have used. 
In fact, his vocal efforts might be classed with those of the Chipping 
Sparrow as a nuisance which we are willing to endure for the sake of 
the great benefits derived from the ceaseless activity of the birds in 
ridding our trees and shrubs of insects and worms. At the same 
time there is a certain individuality expressed in the songs of these 
birds of the field which we should be sorry to lose. Long live 
Dickcissel!

    GOLDFINCH 
The American Goldfinch, or Wild Canary as he is commonly called, is really a finer singer 
than my song would indicate. Fully to appreciate his powers one must hear his free, rapturous 
warble, strongly suggesting the style and voice of the caged canary, but too florid to permit of 
its being accurately placed upon the staff, or used as a theme for a song. I have merely used 
his well-known “sweet” and his flight song, the latter, in particular, being quite distinctive. 
I have seen a number of these birds flying over the fields in the dead of winter, their winter 
plumage of brown and black causing them to be easily mistaken for their cousins, the Sparrows, 
were it not for the characteristic undulating flight, each dip punctuated by the cheerful 
“perchicoree.” Dressed in his summer coat of yellow and_ black he is a joy to behold, while his 
careless, flowing song, so filled with the joy of living, is sufficient to dispel the worst case of blues.

      CHIPPING SPARROW 
The Chipping Sparrow, also called Hairbird from his habit of lining his nest with long hair, 
is one of the most sociable of his family, seeming from preference to build his nest in the vines or 
low branches of a tree near a human habitation. 
As a musician, however, we shall have to mark him very low in comparison with other 
Sparrows, his repertoire being limited to a short call-note, and the rapid repetition of a single tone 
as illustrated in the song. As has been frequently remarked, it sounds not unlike the whirring 
of a sewing machine, though why one writer should have discriminated in favor of the Singer 
Sewing Machine rather than any other variety, is beyond me. 
As might be surmised, the song soon becomes very monotonous, and were it not for our love 
for the singer, we might not be so willing to listen to it day after day.

ENGLISH SPARROW 
Last winter a friend asked me if I had written a song about the 
English Sparrow. I replied that I had not, but that if I ever did, I 
should try to write one that would not increase the bird’s popularity; 
subsequently I wrote this song. In it I have certainly said nothing 
good about him which might add to his standing, for I know no good 
to say. He is agreed by all, including the Biological Survey, to be a 
pest, without a saving grace, unless we except the fact that when 
served on toast with several of his fellows, he makes a really tooth- 
some morsel. 
Some communities have undertaken crusades against him in the 
interést of our native songbirds, which he is constantly fighting, but 
until such a movement becomes universal, I fear it will be more or 
less futile. 
His vocal expression is utterly lacking in musical value—a 
ceaseless chatter, monotonous in the extreme. 
Having then, no musical theme for inspiration, beyond his 
“cheap” call, I have written for him this song, which is, I confess, 
as cheap as he.

CHESTNUT-SIDED WARBLER 
This is one of the commonest of the Warblers, and also one of the 
most persistent singers. His song adheres to a more or less definite 
rhythm, though there is considerable variation in the form of the 
figure. Different songs, too, will suggest different syllables. The 
ones which I have used with the first theme, ‘‘wit-wit-wit-wit-wit- 
weechew!” seem to be imitative of the songs which I have heard. For 
the second theme I am indebted to Mr. Frank M. Chapman, who 
included it in his book, ‘“(he Warblers of North America.” 
It may be remarked in passing, that a given song, though more 
or less definite as to its musical form, may suggest entirely different 
words to different listeners. For instance, the wife of a clergyman 
recently told me that a Chewink which sang near her summer cottage said, “Preacher! tee he-he-he!” while another insists that the same 
bird says, “Pretty birdie-e-e-e-e!” It is well to remember, however, 
that two individuals of the same species may sing songs that are 
quite different, and that a given individual may have several songs, 
differing only slightly in form, but suggesting quite different words 
or syllables.

BLACK AND WHITE WARBLER 
The Black and White Warbler, or Black and White Creeper, as 
he is sometimes called, might easily be confounded with the White- 
breasted Nuthatch, from his habit of running up and down and 
around the limbs of trees in his quest for food. His voice, however, 
is quite unlike that of the Nuthatch, being thin and wiry, very high 
pitched and, like the Nuthatch, quite lacking in beauty. Sometimes 
his song is given on a single pitch and sometimes on two alternating 
tones a second or a third apart. Some writers represent his song by 
the syllables ‘‘wesee-wesee-wesee,” etc. The birds which I have 
heard seem to sing ‘‘weche-weche-weche,” and besides, these syllables 
seem a bit easier to sing. 
As a class Warblers have not much musical ability. But, as 
Mr. Chapman suggests, while they are not great songsters they are 
great singers, and because of their small size and great activity, 
which render an adequate view of them difficult, the songs serve as 
the easiest means of identification.

    RED-WINGED BLACKBIRD 
The unique song and flaming epaulets of the Red-wing have touched the imagination of 
many a poet. While the syllabic representation of his song has been varied, more varied, indeed, 
than the musical form of it, yet it will be noted that they all end with the sound of long “‘e.”_ In- 
asmuch as this is quite characteristic of his song, I have endeavored, so far as was possible, to 
observe this point in writing the words of this song. 
‘The two notes played by the piano in the refrain represent the call or complaint of the male 
bird when the nest is threatened. As the bird slurs the two notes, a good effect is produced 
when a second person whistles them. 
There is no doubt that the tendency on the part of many birds to imitate the sounds of nature 
to which they are accustomed, accounts for certain characteristics of their songs. With this in 
mind, we can more readily understand the liquid quality of the Red-wing’s voice, living, as he 
does, in marshy places.

    BROWN THRASHER 
The Brown Thrasher—a singer indeed, who gladdens the hearts of all within the range of 
his voice. Perched upon the topmost branch of the tallest tree in the neighborhood, he pours 
forth his song with a spirit which seems to bear out the contention that birds sing for the pure 
joy of singing. 
There is no set form which he follows, but rather a continuous discourse consisting of short 
phrases of from two to six notes each, with very short pauses between phrases. One of his peculi- 
arities is his tendency to sing a phrase frequently twice in succession, a characteristic which 
distinguishes his song from that of other continuous singers such as the Catbird, Robin and Red- 
eyed Vireo. 
The song which I offer herewith, while made up from beginning to end of Thrasher themes 
which are quite exact so far as the intervals are concerned, is not entirely a true presentation 
of the Thrasher style, because, for the sake of singability, I have made the various phrases follow 
each other closely, instead of allowing for the customary pauses. I believe that the gain in 
coherence will more than compensate for this lack.

interesting experience. Darkness always holds mystery for the 
childish imagination, but to hear issuing, from “the twofold dark of 
the night and the wood,” the audible manifestation of the hitherto 
unknown, though always suspected terrors, is enough to upset any 
child with a healthy imagination. 
There is no doubt that the cry of this bird strikes terror to the 
hearts of the small birds and other little creatures upon which he preys, 
but luckily his eyesight is poor by day and the songbirds have doubt- 
less learned that there is security in remaining hidden within the pro- 
tecting foliage of tree and shrub. 
‘The cry is not always given in the form here used. Sometimes 
there is no variation from one pitch, and again the succession of 
notes may be quite different, perhaps with a falling of the voice at 
the close. ‘Vhis form will be found quite characteristic, however.

RED-HEADED WOODPECKER 
This song might be designated as the performance of the fife 
and drum corps of the forest. Since it is true that aside from his 
ability as a drummer, the Red-head is not much of a musician, it 
seemed legitimate to call upon some of his neighbors to help him in 
his song. It is rather worthy of remark, moreover, that the perform- 
ance of each of the three birds is unique, the Partridge using his wings, 
the Bob-white his voice and the Woodpecker, who plays the title- 
role, using both voice and bill. A strange way for a hero to express 
his love, pounding his head against a tree; but so long as he gains 
his ‘point, what matter? 
‘The Woodpeckers are useful members of their tribe, and this 
particular one, with his red hood and black and white coat, is worthy 
of our most careful protection.

    DOWNY WOODPECKER 
It is not claimed that the theme which is used as the basis of this song is an accurate tran- scription of the Downy’s musical expression. As a suggestion of it, however, it is fairly true, as true, perhaps, as is possible, for none of the Woodpeckers sings anything like a real melody, judged by our standards, 
As a worker, however, he is worthy of emulation, for, summer or winter, we may find him industriously searching for worms, insects or larva, and his ringing call or staccato “pick! pick!’’ are a constant reminder that here is one wielder of the pick who will never go on strike. A suet basket, fastened to a tree trunk, and kept constantly supplied with suet during the cold months, will prove of value in keeping the birds in the neighborhood of your trees, and per- haps preserve the lives of the birds themselves, especially after sleet and ice storms, for birds can endure extremely cold weather if supplied with sufficient heat-producing food.

    FLICKER 
The Flicker, or Golden-winged Woodpecker, is no better singer than his cousins, though 
he is more versatile than they in the expression of his emotions. Like the other Woodpeckers he 
is very fond of beating a tattoo upon some resounding surface—in the woods, a hollow limb or 
tree trunk will suffice, though he has léarned, with the advent of civilization, that the roof or side 
of a building makes a still finer drum, and when he finds a tin roof his joy, as well as the vigor of his 
blows, seems to know no bounds. 
His vocal expressions are varied and interesting, consisting, in addition to his single call- 
notes, of series of notes or intervals, repeated in rapid succession. The present song contains 
fairly accurate imitations of two of these series. 
The Flicker is the largest of our common Woodpeckers, and, unlike the others, spends a 
good part of his time upon the ground in his search for food.

RED-BELLIED WOODPECKER 
This Woodpecker is not so common as the other three which I 
have treated in this series. His calls are so interesting and suggestive, 
however, that I feel that I am justified in presenting him both to those 
who know him and to others who might otherwise never make his 
acquaintance. 
The first theme, which suggested at the first hearing the words 
‘Who will? who will?” I secured when on a tramp early one February. 
It seemed to be a call to his mate, for she soon came flying to the tree 
stub upon which he was working. ‘The second theme, by far the 
more common, and sounding like ‘‘chat-chat-choo-choo!” is given at 
intervals, as he searches about the limbs and trunks of trees for his 
prey. The intervals are quite exact, and the call is delivered with 
energy and precision. 
As will be observed, I have endeavored in the song to use words 
that are imitative of these syllables.

BRONZED GRACKLE 
We cannot claim that this bird is a good singer. The result of 
his effort to make a joyful noise has rather the sound of a rusty pump 
than a singing bird. When a flock of them settles in a tree for a 
brief spell during their fall migration, the Babel of voices reminds one 
of a quilting party. Noone knows the meaning or the purpose of the 
chatter—whether the subject under discussion is the route which lies 
before them, or where the best forage may be found, or whether they 
are just happy that they are alive and on the way. 
It is because they are so frequently heard chattering together 
that I have written this song in two parts. ‘Chet-a-lunk-ee!”’ is, 
of course, but a suggestion of the sound. It should be sung with a 
squeaky tone, especially the final syllable.

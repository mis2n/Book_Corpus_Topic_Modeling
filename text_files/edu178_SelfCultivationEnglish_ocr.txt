INTRODUCTION 
ENGLISH as a school subject grows more impor- 
tant in the education of our youth. Its place in 
our schools begins to be as large as its position 
in every-day life. And gradually the aims pur- 
sued by the school in English teaching conform 
to those practical and artistic purposes which are 
usually associated with our spoken and written 
language. 
Educational reform and English study 
The teaching of English reflects the important 
movements for the reform of our schools. There 
is, indeed, no better index of our substantial 
achievements in modern educational affairs than 
those modifications in English i ction which 
are now in progress. The pas dtechnical 
and barren study of grammatical and rhetorical 
forms is part of the general tendency toward the 
subordination of formal subjects. The introduc-

tion of classic material in reading books and the 
study of unmarred literary wholes mark the de- 
termined effort to enrich the school curriculum 
with content significant alike to the child and to 
the society in which he lives. The increased em- 
phasis on English composition as an instrument 
for the communication or expression of the 
child’s thought is a response to the same ideals 
of educational method which are giving manual 
training and the other expressive arts a respect- 
able position in the school curriculum. 
Changes in the spirit of English instruction 
The influence of educational reform on Eng- 
lish instruction extends beyond specific changes 
in the subject matter and methods used in 
schools. It causes wide-sweeping modifications 
in the whole spirit of our English teaching. 
Slowly but certainly it dawns on us that a mere 
study of the formalities of language does not in- 
sure an enjoyment of literature or a command of 
speech. In place of the old and barren insistence 
upon a half-scientific analysis of language which 
leaves us conscious only of the dissected parts

  INTRODUCTION 
of language, modern teaching sets up two new 
major purposes for English study,—to develop 
an appreciation of the best English literature, 
and to train the power of effective expression 
through language. 
The difficulty of training linguistic power 
It is the attainment of this latter end, the im- 
proved use of English as an instrument of expres- 
sion, that presents the largest difficulties to the 
teacher. Most of the current practices of the 
school have been developed mainly with refer- 
ence to giving the child the facts of our organized 
knowledge. Until recently, its methods have not 
been concerned with training him in the applica- 
tion or expression of the thoughts thus attained. 
Hence the weakness of the school in teaching 
children to speak and write good English is con- 
spicuous, and hence the need to improve the 
conditions that underlie the acquirement of clear 
and forceful expression and to develop new 
modes of transmitting the technique of English 
speech and writing.
-P-A-G-E-8
  INTRODUCTION 
Conditions have been unfavorable 
The schools of to-day find it difficult to under- 
take the training of literary power because un- 
favorable conditions persist from the schools of 
a century ago. Time was when any deliberate 
effort to teach children to write in school would 
have largely failed because there was no clear 
recognition of the fact that there can be no cul- 
tivation of the power to use English without an 
adequate development of enriched thought to be 
expressed. That older school which was mainly 
concerned with the formal subjects — the three 
R’s, grammar, rhetoric, and the like— gave chil- 
dren little that could be the basis of real, written 
composition. True expression is always self-ex- 
pression, and for self-expression more is required 
than the committing to memory of ideas. The 
schools of that other day, in so far as they con- 
tributed to the knowledge of children, imposed it 
upon them authoritatively, without any special 
consideration of their interests or needs. What 
the school asked children to express, they had 
no desire to express ; and what they might choose 
vi
-P-A-G-E-9
  INTRODUCTION 
to say, the school regarded as trivial. Hence our 
poverty of literary power in the schools has de- 
scended to us along with dull courses of study 
and dogmatic methods of teaching. 
Conditions grow more favorable 
The newer movements in education tend to 
establish conditions which are a striking contrast 
to those of the past. The course of study has 
been enriched by the addition of new subjects 
and by the vitalization of old studies. First-hand 
contact with the natural world and with human 
life is guaranteed as never before. Much of the 
acquisition of knowledge is closely connected 
with active ways of learning. Above all, there is 
a sympathy for children which recognizes that 
true education must start with the vital impulses 
of child-life. Under such an order children have 
something to say, and they want to say it. And 
teachers are willing to listen or read, as the case 
may be, knowing that the forces which make for 
literary power are there, ready to be restrained 
or refined as the canons of good taste and clear 
expression demand.

  INTRODUCTION 
Methods of improving literary power 
| Now that we have our children speaking and 
writing we need to know how we can improve 
those crude talents which instinct and a favor- 
able school life permit. The problem is a new 
one for the pedagogue, for the transmission of 
the power to write is very different from the 
transmission of grammatical or rhetorical facts. 
Indeed, it may be said that we cannot transmit 
the power of using English. In the last analysis, 
good English usage is a matter of self-cultiva- 
tion. The teacher, however, can supervise the 
process of self-development. By insuring a rich 
thought-life, by fostering opportunities for its 
expression, by encouraging worthy effort, by 
providing practice for right speech, and by attend- 
ing to the hundred other details which are a 
necessary care, the teacher may help the present 
generation to achieve the ability to use with 
| force and grace their mother tongue that has 
come to its present power and beauty only after 
many generations of refined development. But 
there can be no effective self-cultivation in Eng-

lish, or helpful direction of the same, without some 
knowledge of the technical processes by which 
literary power is to be attained. There must be 
some knowledge of the way the deed is done, 
some hint of the factors that make for good 
expression. 
A guide for students and teacher 
With the above need in mind, there is here 
presented an essay on “ Self-Cultivation in Eng- 
lish.” At once a clear analysis of the fundamen- 
tal elements in the noble use of language and 
a fine example of the use of good English, it 
is offered to the public with a sense of its double 
worth. While it is strongly commended to stu- 
dents in our higher schools as a guide and model 
for them in their effort to improve their use of 
English, it is primarily included within this series 
in order that teachers and parents may have its 
assistance in focusing their attention upon those 
matters of large importance in speaking and writ- 
ing which must be the care of all who would 
make of their own expression a worthy model 
and guide for others.

Encuisn study has four aims: the mastery of 
our language as a science, as a history, as a joy, 
and as a tool. I am concerned with. but one, the 
mastery of it asa tool. Philology and grammar 
present it as a science; the one attempting to 
follow its words, the other its sentences, through 
all the intricacies of their growth, and so to mani- 
fest laws which lie hidden in these airy products 
no less than in the moving stars or the myriad 
flowers of spring. Fascinating and important as 
all this is, I do not recommend it here, For I 
want to call attention only to that sort of Eng- 
lish study which can be carried on without any 
large apparatus of books. For a reason similar, 
though less cogent, (Ido not _urge_historical

and without gaps intervening, in a way that 
would be hard to parallel in any other language 
known to man. A bounteous endowment this 
for every English speaker, and one which should 
stimulate us to trace the marvelous and close- 
linked progress from the times of the Saxons to 
those of Tennyson and Kipling. Literature, too, 
‘has this advantage over every other species of 
" art study, that everybody can examine the origi- 
nal masterpieces and not depend on reproduc- 
| tions, as in the cases of painting, sculpture, and 
\ architecture ; or on intermediate interpretation, 
as in the case of music. To-day most of these 
masterpieces can be bought for a trifle, and even 
a poor man can follow through centuries the 
thoughts of his ancestors. But even so, ready of 
access as it is, English can be studied as a his- 
tory only at the cost of solid time and continuous 
attention, much more time than the majority of 
those I am addressing can afford. By most of us 
our mighty literature cannot be taken in its con- 
tinuous current, the later stretches proving inter- 
esting through relation with the earlier. It must 
be taken fragmentarily, if at all, the attention

greatest beauty or promise the best exhilaration. 
In other words) English may be possible as a joy 
where it is not possible asa history. In the end- 
less wealth which our poetry, story, essay, and 
drama afford, every disposition may find its 
appropriate nutriment, correction, or solace. He

loved authors, veritable friends with whom he 
takes refuge in the intervals of work, and by 
whose intimacy he~enlarges, refines, sweetens, 
and emboldens his own limited existence. Yet 
the fact that (English as a joy must largely be 
conditioned by individual taste prevents me from 
offering general rulés for-its pursuits. The road 
which leads one man straight to enjoyment leads 
another to” tedium. ‘In all literary enjoyment 
there is something incalculable, something way- 
ward, eluding the precision of rule and rendering 
inexact the precepts of him who would point out 
the path to it? While I believe that many sug- 
gestions may be made, useful to the young en- 
joyer, and promotive of his wise vagrancy, I

offering them. “Let enjoyment go, let history go, 
let science go, and still English remains — Eng. 
lish as a tool. Every hour our language is an 
engine for communicating with others, every 
instant for fashioning the thoughts of our own 
minds.’ I want to call attention to the means of 
mastering this curious and essential tool, and to 
lead every one who hears me to become discon- 
nted with his employment of it) 
‘The importance of literary power needs no 
long argument. Everybody acknowledges it, and 
sees that without it all other human faculties 
are maimed, ‘Shakespeare says that “Time in- 
sults o’er dull and speechless tribes.” It and all 
who live in it insult over the speechless person: 
So mutually dependent are we that on our swift 
and full communication with one another is 
staked the success of almost every scheme we 
form. ‘Gre who can explain himself may com- 
mand what-he wants. He who cannot is left to 
the poverty of individual resource; for men do 
what we desire only when persuadedj’ The per- 
suasive and explanatory tongue is, therefore, one 
of the chief levers of life: Its leverage is felt

within us as well as without, for expression and 
thought are integrally bound together. We do 
not_first.possess.completed.thoughts, and then 
express them. The very formation of the out- 
ward product extends, sharpens, enriches the 
mind which produces, so that he who gives forth 
little, after a time is likely enough to discover 
that he has little to give forth. By expression, 
too, we may carry our benefits and our names to 
afar generation. This durable character of fra- 
gile language puts a wide difference of worth 
between it and some of the other great objects 
of desire, — health, wealth, and beauty, for ex- 
ample. These are. notoriously liable to accident. 
We tremble while we have them. But literary 
power, once ours, is more likely than any other 
possession to be ours always. It perpetuates and 
enlarges itself by the very fact of its existence, 
and perishes only with the decay of the man 
himself. ~For this reason, because more than 
health, wealth, and beauty, literary style may be 
called the man, good judges have found in it the 
final test of culture, and have said that he and he 
alone, is a-well-educated person who uses his lan-

guage with power and beauty. The supreme and 
ultimate product of civilization, it has been well 
said, is two or three persons talking together in 
a room. Between ourselves and our language 
there accordingly springs up an association pe- 
culiarly close. We are as sensitive to criticism 
of our speech as of our manners. The young man 
‘looks up with awe to him who has written a book, 
as already half divine ; and the graceful speaker 
is a universal object of envy. 
“'\ But the very fact that literary endowment is 
immediately recognized and eagerly envied has 
induced a strange illusion in regard to it. It is 
supposed to be something mysterious, innate in 
him who possesses it, and quite out of the reach 
of him who has it not. The very contrary is the 
fact. No human employment is more free and cal- 
culable than the winning of language. Undoubtedly 
there are natural aptitudes for it, as there are for 
farming, seamanship, or being a good husband. 
But nowhere is straight work more effective. Per- 
sistence, care, discriminating observation, inge- 
nuity, refusal to lose heart, — traits which in every 
other occupation tend toward excellence, -——tend

toward it here with special security( Whoever goes 
to his grave with bad English in his mouth has no 
one to blame but himself for the disagreeable 
taste })for if faulty speech can be inherited, it can’ 
be exterminated too) I hope to point out some of 
the methods of substituting good English for bad. 
And since my space is brief, and I wish to be 
remembered,I throw what I have to say into the 
form of four simple precepts, which, if pertina- 
ciously obeyed, will, I believe, give anybody effec- 
tive mastery of English as-a tool. 
First, then, “Look well to your speech.” ” It is 
commonly supposed that when a man seeks lit. 
erary power he goes to his room and plans an 
article for the press. But this is to begin literary 
culture at the wrong end. We speak a hundred 
times for every once we write. The busiest writer 
produces little more than a volume a year, 
not so much as his talk would amount to ina 
week.’ Consequently through speech it is usually 
decided whether a man is to have command of 
his language or not. If he is slovenly in his 
ninety-nine cases of talking, he can seldom pull 
himself up to strength and exactitude in the 
we  
-P-A-G-E-22
  SELF-CULTIVATION 
hundredth case of writing. A person is made in 
one piece, and the same being runs through a 
multitude of performances: Whether words are 
uttered on paper or to the air, the effect on the 
utterer is the same. Vigor or feebleness results 
according as energy or slackness has been in 
command. I know that certain adaptations to a 
new field are often necessary. A good speaker 
may find awkwardness in himself when he comes 
to write, a good writer when he speaks, And 
certainly cases occur where. a man exhibits 
distinct strength in one of the two, speaking or 
writing, and not in the other. But such cases are 
rare, As a rule, language once within our con- 
trol can be employed for oral:or fot written pur- 
poses. And since the opportunities for oral prac-~ 
tice enormously outbalance those for written, 
it is the oral which.are chiefly significant in the 
development of literary power. We rightly say 
of the accomplished writer that’ he shows a mas- 
tery of his own tongue. __ 
This predominant influence of speech marks 
nearly all great epochs of literature. The Ho- 
meric poems are adaressed to the ear, not to the 
8
-P-A-G-E-23
  IN ENGLISH 
eye. It is doubtful if Homer knew writing, cer- 
tain that he knew profoundly every quality of 
the tongue, — veracity, vividness, shortness of 
sentence, simplicity of thought, obligation to 
insure swift apprehension. Writing and rigidity 
are apt to go together. In these smooth-slipping 
verses one catches everywhere the voice. So, 
too, the aphorisms of Hesiod might naturally 
pass from mouth to mouth, and the stories of 
Herodotus be told by an old man at the fireside. 
Early Greek literature is plastic and garrulous, 
Its distinctive glory is that it contains no literary 
note; that it gives forth human feeling not 
in conventional arrangement, but with apparent 
spontaneity —in short, that it is speech litera~ 
“ture, not book literature. And the same ten- 
dency continued long among the Greeks. At the 
culmination of their power, the drama was their 
chief literary form,—the drama, which is but 
speech ennobled,.connected,.clarified. Plato too, 
following the dramatic precedent and the pre- 
cedent of his talking master, accepted conversa- 
tion as his medium for philosophy, and imparted 
to it the vivacity, ease, waywardness even, which 
9
-P-A-G-E-24
SELF-CULTIVATION 
the best conversation exhibits. Nor was the ex- 
perience of the Greeks peculiar. Our literature 
shows a similar tendency. Its bookish times are 
its decadent times, its talking times its glory. 
Chaucer, like Herodotus, is a story-teller, and | 
follows the lead of those who on the Continent 
entertained courtly circles with pleasant tales. 
Shakespeare and his fellows in the spacious times 
of great Elizabeth did not concern themselves 
with publication. Marston, in one of his prefaces, 
thinks it necessary to apologize for putting his ‘ 
piece in-print, and says he would not have done 
  such a thing if unscrupulous persons, hearing the 
play at the theatre, had not already printed cor- 
rupt versions of it. Even the “Queen Anne’s 
men,” far removed though they are from any- 
thing dramatic, still shape their ideals of litera 
ture by demands of speech. The essays of the 
“Spectator,” the poems of Pope, are the remarks 
of a cultivated gentleman at an evening party. 
Here is the brevity, the good taste, the light 
touch, the neat epigram, the avoidance of what- 
ever might stir passion, controversy, or laborious 
thought, which characterizé the conversation of 
10
-P-A-G-E-25
  Av IN ENGLISH 
a well-bred man. Indeed, it is hard to see how 
any literature can be long vital which is based 
on the thought of a book and not on that of 
living utterance. Unless the speech notion is 
uppermost, words will not run swiftly to their 
mark. They delay in delicate phrasings while 
naturalness and a sense of reality disappear. 
Women are the best talkers. I sometimes please 
myself with noticing that three of the greatest 
periods of English literature coincide with the 
reigns of the three English queens. 
¥ Fortunate it is, then, that self-cultivation in 
the use of English must chiefly come through 
speech ; because we-are..always..speaking,.what- 
@verélse we do In opportunities for acquiring 
a mastery of language, the poorest and busiest 
are at no large disadvantage as compared with 
the leisured rich. It is true the strong impulse 
which comes from the suggestion and approval 
of society may in some cases be absent, but this 
can be compensated by the sturdy purpose of the 
eons recognition of the beauty of_well- 
ordered words, a strong desire, patience under 
discouragements, and promptness in counting

the simple agencies which sweep one on to 
power. “Watch your speech, then..That is all

Our _words should fit our thoughts like one 
and be neither too wide nor too tight. If too 
wide, they will include much vacuity beside the 
intended matter. If too tight, they will check the 
strong grasp. Of the two dangers, looseness is by 
far the greater. There are people who say what 
they mean with such a naked precision that 
nobody not familiar with the subject can quickly 
catch the sense. George Herbert and Emerson 
strain the attention of many. But niggardly and 
angular speakers are rare. Too frequently words 
signify nothing in particular. They are merely 
thrown out in a certain direction, to report a 
vague and undetermined meaning or even a gen- 
eral emotion. The first business of every one 
who would train himself in language is to artic-

-P-A-G-E-27

ulate his thought, to know. definitely what he 
wishes to say, and then to pick those words 
which compel the hearer to think of this and 
only this. For such-a-purpose two words are 
often better than three. The fewer the words, 
the more pungent.the impression. Brevity is the 
soul not simply of a jest, but of wit in its finest 
sense where it is identical with wisdom. He who 
can put a great deal into a little is the master. 
(Since firm texture is what is wanted, not em- 
broidery or superposed ornament, beauty has 
een well defined as the purgation of superflui- | 
(ties. And certainly many a paragraph might/ 
have its beauty brightened by letting quiet 
words take the place of its loud words, omitting 
its “verys,” and striking out its purple patches 
of “fine writing.” Here is Ben Jonson’s descrip- 
tion of Bacon’s language: “There happened in 
my time one noble speaker who was full of grav- 
ity in his speech. No man ever spoke more 
neatly, more pressly, more weightily, or suffered 
less emptiness, less idleness, in what he uttered. 
No member of his speech but consisted of his 
own graces. His hearers could not cough or

look aside without loss.‘He commanded when 
he spoke, and had his judges angry or pleased at 
his discretion.” Such are the men who command, 
men who speak “neatly and pressly.” But to 
gain such precision is toilsome business. While 
we are in training for it, no word must unper- 
mittedly pass the portal of the teeth. Gomething 
like what we mean must never be counted equiv- 
alent to what we mean.) And if we are not sure 
of our meaning or of our word, we must pause 
until we are sure.“Accuracy does not come of 
itself. For persons who can use several lan- 
guages, capital practice in acquiring it can be 
had by translating from one language to another 
and seeing that the entire sense is carried over. 
Those who have only their native_speech will 
find it profitable often to attempt definitions of 
the common words they use. Inaccuracy Mes 
(not stand up against the habit of definition, 
‘Dante boasted that no rhythmic exigency had 
ever made him say what he did not mean. We 
heedless and unintending speakers, under no 
exigency of rhyme or reason, say what we mean 
but seldom, and still more seldom mean what we 
14 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  IN ENGLISH 
say. To hold our thoughts and words in signifi- 
cant adjustment requires unceasing conscious- 
ness, a perpetual determination not to tell lies; 
for of course every inaccuracy is a bit of un- 
truthfulness, We have something in mind, yet 
convey something else to our hearer. And no 
moral purpose will save us from this untruthful- 
ness unless that purpose is sufficient to inspire 
the daily drill which brings the power to be true. 
Again and again we are shut up to evil because 
we have not acquired the ability of goodness. 
But after all, I hope that nobody who hears 
me will quite agree. There is something enervat- 
ing in conscious care. Necessary as it is in 
shaping our purposes, if allowed too direct and 
exclusive control consciousness breeds hesitation 
and feebleness. Action is not excellent, at least, 
until spontaneous. In piano-playing we begin by 
picking out each separate note; but we do not 
call the result music until we play our notes by 
the handful, heedless how each is formed. And so 
it is everywhere. Consciously selective conduct 
is elementary and inferior. People distrust it, or 
rather they distrust him who exhibits it. If any-

body talking to us visibly studies his words, we 
turn away. What he says may be well enough 
as school exercise, but it is not conversation. 
Accordingly if we would have our speech forci- 
ble, we shall need to put into it quite as much 
of audacity as we do of precision, terseness, or 
simplicity. Accuracy alone is not a thing to 
be sought, but accuracy and dash. It was said 
of Fox, the English orator and statesman, that 
he was accustomed to throw himself headlong 
into the middle of a sentence, trusting to God 
Almighty to get him out. So must we speak. 
We must not, before beginning a sentence, de- 
cide what the end shall be; for if we do, nobody 
will care to hear that end. At the beginning, it 
is the beginning which claims the attention of 
both speaker and listener.and trepidation about 
going on will mar all. We must give our thought 
its head, and not drive it with too tight a rein, 
or grow timid when it begins to prance a bit. 
Of course we must retain coolness in courage, 
applying the results of our previous discipline in 
accuracy ; but we need not move so. slowly as to 
become formal. Pedantry is worse than blunder-

ing. If we care for grace and flexible beauty of 
language, we must learn to let our th un. 
Would it, then, be too much of an Irish bull to 
say that in acquiring English we need to culti- 
vate spontaneity ? The uncultivated kind is not 
worth much;; it is wild and haphazard stuff, un- 
adjusted to its uses. On the other hand, no 
speech is of much account, however just, which 
lacks the element ‘of courage. Accuracy and 
dash, then, the combination of the two, must be 
our difficult aim; and we must not rest satisfied 
so long as either dwells with us alone. 
But are the two so hostile as they at first 
appear? Or can, indeed, the first be obtained 
without the aid of the second? Supposing we are 
convinced that words possess no value in them- 
selves, and are correct or incorrect only as they 
truly report experience, we shall feel ourselves 
impelled in the mere interest of accuracy to 
choose them freshly, and to put them together 
in ways in which they never codperated before, 
so as to set forth with distinctness that which 
just we, not other people, have seen or felt. The 
reason why we do not naturally have this daring 
17 oo ce wu 
 
-P-A-G-E-32

exactitude is probably twofold. We let our ex- 
periences be blurred, not observing sharply, or 
knowing with any minuteness what we are think- 
ing about ; and so there is no individuality in 
our language. And then, besides, we are terror- 
ized by custom, and inclined to adjust what we 
would say to what others have said before. The 
cure for the first of these troubles is to keep 
our eye on our object, instead of on our listener 
or ourselves ; and for the. second, to learn to_rate 
Y/ he expressiveness of language more highly than P' $0 guag gny. 
lits correctness, The opposite of this, the dispo- 
sition to set correctness above expressiveness, 
produces that.peculiarly vulgar diction known

this because ordinary people have only three or 
four thousand things to say? Not at all. It is 
simply due to dullness. Listen to the average 
school-boy. He has a dozen or two nouns, half 
a dozen verbs, three or four adjectives, and 
enough conjunctionsand prepositions to stick the 
conglomerate together. This ordinary speech 
deserves the description which Hobbes gave to 
his “ State of Nature,” that “it is solitary, poor, 
nasty, brutish, and short.” The fact is, we fall 
into the way of thinking that the wealthy words _ 
are for others, and that they do not belong to us. 
_ Weare like those who have received a vast in- 
heritance, but who persist in the inconveniences 
of hard beds, scanty food, rude clothing, who 
never travel, and who limit their purchases to 
the bleak necessities of life. Ask such people 
why they endure niggardly living while wealth in 
plenty is lying in the bank, and they can only 
answer that they have never learned how to 
spend. But this is worth learning. Milton used 
eight thousand words, Shakespeare fifteen thou- 
sand. We have all the subjects to talk about 
that these early speakers had; and in addition, 
20
-P-A-G-E-35
  IN ENGLISH 
we have bicycles and sciences and strikes and 
political combinations and all the complicated 
living of the modern world. 
Why, then, do we hesitate to swell our words 
to meet our needs? It is a nonsense question. 
There is no reason. We are simply lazy; too 
lazy to make ourselves comfortable. We let our 
vocabularies be limited, and get along rawly 
without the refinements of human intercourse, 
without refinements in our own thoughts; for 
thoughts are almost as dependent on words as 
words on thoughts. For example, all exaspera- 
tions we lump together as “aggravating,” not 
considering whether they may not rather be dis- 
pleasing, annoying, offensive, disgusting, irritat- 
ing, or even maddening; and without observ- 
ing, too, that in our reckless usage we have 
burned up a word which might be convenient 
when we should need to mark some shading of 
the word “increase.” Like the bad cook, we 
seize the frying-pan whenever we need to fry, 
broil, roast, or stew, and then we wonder why all 
our dishes taste alike while in the next house 
the food is appetizing. It is all unnecessary.

ee the vocabulary. Let any one who wants   
to see himself grow, resolve to adopt two new 
words each week. It will not be long before the 
endless and enchanting variety of the world will 
begin to reflect itself in his speech, and in his 
mind as well,) I know that when we use a word 
for the first time we are startled, as if a fire- 
cracker went off in our neighborhood. We look 
about hastily to see if any one has noticed. But 
finding that no one has, we may be emboldened. 
A word used three times slips off the tongue 
with entire naturalness. Then it is ours forever, 
and with it some phase of life which had been 
lacking hitherto. For each word presents its own 
point of view, discloses a special aspect of things, 
reports some little importance not otherwise con- 
veyed, and so contributes its small emancipation 
to our tied-up minds and tongues. 
But a brief warning may be necessary to make . 
my meaning clear. In urging the addition of new 
words to our present poverty-stricken stock, I 
am far from suggesting that we should seek out 
strange, technical, or inflated expressions, which 
do not appear in ordinary conversation. The very 
22 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  IN ENGLISH 
opposite is my aim. I would put every man who 
is now employing a diction merely local and per- 
sonal in command of the approved resources of 
the English language. Our poverty usually comes 
shrough provinciality, through accepting without 
criticism the habits of our special set. My family, 
my immediate friends, have a diction of their 
own. Plenty of other words, recognized as sound, 
are known to be current in books, and to be em- 
ployed by modest and intelligent speakers, only 
we do not use them. Our set has never said 
“diction,” or “current,” or “ scope,” or “scanty,” 
or “hitherto,” or “convey,” or “lack.” Far from 
unusual as these words are, to adopt them might 
seem to set me apart from those whose intellec- 
tual habits I share. From this I shrink. I do not 
like to wear clothes suitable enough for others, 
but not in the style of my own plain circle. Yet 
if each one of that circle does the same, the 
general shabbiness is increased. The talk of all 
is made narrow enough to fit the thinnest there. 
What we should seek is to contribute to each of 
the little companies with which our life is bound 
up a gently enlarging influence, such impulses

as will not startle or create detachment, but 
which may save from humdrum, routine, and 
~_ dreary usualness. {We cannot be really kind 
without being a little venturesome.) The small 
shocks of our increasing vocabulary will in all 
probability be as helpful to our friends as to our- 
selves. :

{ lish, we must make our daily talk accurate, dar- 
LY \ing, and ae have insisted on these points the 
more becatise in my judgment all literary power, 
especially that of busy. men, is rooted in sound 
speech. But though the roots are here, the 
growth is also elsewhere. And I pass to my 
later precepts, which, if the earlier one has been 
laid well to heart, will require only brief discus- 
sion. 
Secondly, ‘Welcome every opportunity for 
‘writing.’ Important as I have shown speech to 
be, there is much that it cannot do. Seldom can / 
it teach structure. Its space is too small. Talk- 
ing moves in sentences, and rarely demands a 
paragraph. I make my little remark, —a dozen 
24  
-P-A-G-E-39
IN ENGLISH 
or two words, —then wait for my friend to hand 
me back as many more. This gentle exchange 
continues by the hour; but either of us would 
feel himself unmannerly if he should grasp an 
entire five minutes and make it uninterruptedly 
his. That would not be speaking, but rather 
speech-making. The brief groupings of words 
which make up our talk furnish capital practice 
in precision, boldness, and variety; but they do 
not contain room enough for exercising our con- 
structive faculties. Considerable length is neces- 
sary if we are to learn how to set forth B in 
right relation to A on the one hand, and to C 
on the other; and while keeping each a distinct 
part, are to be able through their smooth pro- 
gression to weld all the parts together into a 
compacted whole. Such wholeness is what we 
mean by literary form. Lacking it, any piece of 
writing is a failure; because, in truth, it is not 
a piece, but pieces. For ease of reading, or for 
the attainment of an intended effect, unity is 
essential —the multitude of statements, anec- 
dotes, quotations, arguings, gay sportings, and 
appeals, all “bending one way their precious 
25
-P-A-G-E-40
SELF-CULTIVATION 
influence.” And this dominant unity of the entire 
piece obliges unity also in the subordinate parts, 
Not enough has been done when we have hud 
dled together a lot of wandering sentences, and 
penned them in a paragraph, or even when we 
have linked them together by the frail ties of 
“and, and," A sentence must be compelled to 
say a single thing ; a paragraph, a single thing ; 
® an essay, a single thing. Each part is to be a 
preliminary whole, and the total a finished whole.) 
But the ability to construct one thing out of 
many does not come by naturé) It implies fe- 
cundity, restraint, an eye for effects, the forecast 
of finish while we are still working in the rough, 
obedience to the demands of development, and 
a deaf ear to whatever calls us into the by-paths 
of caprice; in short, it implies that the good 
writer is to be an artist. 
1 Now something of this large requirement 
which composition makes, the young writer in- 
stinctively feels, and he is terrified. He knows how 
ill-fitted he is to direct “toil codperant to an 
end ;” and when he sits down to the desk and sees 
the white sheet of paper before him, he shivers. 
26
-P-A-G-E-41
    
IN ENGLISH 
Let him know that the shiver is a suitable part 
of the performance. I well remember the plea- 
sure with which, as a young man, I heard my 
venerable and practised professor of rhetoric say 
that he supposed there was no work known to 
man more difficult than writing. Up to that time 
I had supposed its severities peculiar to myself. 
It cheered me, and gave me courage to try again, 
to learn that I had all mankind for my fellow- @ 
sufferers. Where this is not understood, writing is 
avoided. From such avoidance I would save the 
young writer by my precept to seek every oppor- 
tunity to write. For most of us this is a new way 
of confronting composition —treating it as an 
opportunity, a chance, and not as a burden or 
compulsion. It saves from slavishness and takes 
away the drudgery of writing, to view each piece 
of it as a precious and necessary step in the 
pathway to power. To those engaged in bread- 
winning employments these opportunities will be 
few. Spring forward to them, then, using them 
to the full. Severe they will be because so few, 
for only practice breeds ease; but on that very 
account let no one of them pass with merely a 
27

second-best performance. \If a letter is to be 
written to a friend, a report to an employer, a 
communication to a newspaper, see that it has a 
beginning, a middle, andan end. The majority of 
writings are without these pleasing adornments. 
Only the great pieces possess them. Bear this in 
mind, and win the way to artistic composition by 
noticing what should be said first, what second, 
and what third. ) 
I cannot leave this subject, however, without 
congratulating the present generation on its ad- 
vantages over mine. Children are brought up 
to-day, in happy contrast with my compeers, to 
feel that the pencil is no instrument of torture, 
hardly indeed to distinguish it from the tongue. 
About the time they leave their mother’s arms 
they take their pen in hand. On paper they are 
encouraged to describe their interesting birds, 
friends, adventures. Their written lessons are 
almost as frequent as their oral, and they learn 
to write compositions while not yet quite under- 
standing what they are about. Some of these 
fortunate ones will, I hope, find the language I 
have sadly used about the difficulty of writing 
28
-P-A-G-E-43
  IN ENGLISH 
extravagant. And let me say, too, that since fre- 
quency has more to do with ease of writing than 
anything else, I count the newspaper men lucky 
because they are writing all the time, and I do 
not think so meanly of their product as the pre- 
sent popular disparagement would seem to re- 
- quire. It is hasty work undoubtedly, and bears 
the marks of haste. But in my judgment, at no 
period of the English language has there been 
so high an average of sensible, vivacious, and 
informing sentences written as appears in our 
daily press. With both good and evil results, the 
distinction between book literature and speech 
literature is breaking down. Everybody is writ- 
ing, apparently in verse and prose; and if the 
higher graces of style do not often appear, neither 
on the other hand do the ruder awkwardnesses 
and obscurities. A certain straightforward English 
is becoming established. A whole nation is learn- 
ing the use of its mother-tongue. Under such 
circumstances it is doubly necessary that any 
one who is conscious of feebleness in his com- 
mand of English should promptly and earnestly 
begin the cultivation of it. 
29
-P-A-G-E-44
  SELF-CULTIVATION 
My third precept shall be, “Remember the 
other person.’” I have been urging self-cultivation 
in English as if it concerned one person alone, 
ourself. But (every utterance really concerns 
two. Its aim is social. Its object is‘communica- 
tion ;/and while unquestionably prompted half- 
way by the desire to ease our mind through 
self-expression, it still finds its only justification 
in the advantage somebody else will draw from 
what is said) Speaking or writing is, therefore, 
everywhere a double-ended process. It springs 
from me, it penetrates him; and both of these 
ends need watching. Is what I say precisely 
what I mean? That is an important question. 
Is what I say so shaped that it can readily be 
assimilated by him who hears? This is a question 
of quite as great consequence, and much more 
likely to be forgotten. We are so full of our- 
selves that we do not remember the other person. 
Helter-skelter we pour forth our unaimed words 
merely for our personal relief, heedless whether 
they help or hinder him whom they still purport 
to address., For most of us are grievously lacking 
in imagination, which is the ability to go outside 
30
-P-A-G-E-45
IN ENGLISH 
ourselves and take on the conditions of another 
mind.) Yet this is what the literary artist is al- 
ways doing. He has at once the ability to see for 
himself and the ability to see himself as others 
see him. He can lead two lives as easily as one 
life ; or rather, he has trained himself to consider 
that other life as of more importance than his, - 
and to reckon his comfort, likings, and labors as 
quite subordinated to the service of that other.) 
All serious literary work contains within it this 
readiness to bear another’s burden. I must write 
with pains, that he may read with ease. I must 
Find out men’s wants and wills, 
And meet them fhere. 
As I write, I must unceasingly study what is the 
line of least intellectual resistance along which 
my thought may enter the differently constituted 
mind ; and to that line I must subtly adjust, with- 
out enfeebling, my meaning. Will this combina- 
tion of words or that make the meaning clear? 
Will this order of presentation facilitate swift- 
. ness of apprehension, or will it clog the move- 
ment ? What temperamental perversities in me 
31  
-P-A-G-E-46
SELF-CULTIVATION 
must be set aside in order to render my reader’s 
approach to what I would tell him pleasant ? 
What temperamental perversities in him must:be 
accepted by me as fixed facts, conditioning all I 
say? These are the questions the skillful writer 
is always asking. 
And these questions, as will have been per- 
ceived already, are moral questions no less than 
literary. That golden rule of generous service 
by which we do for others what we would have 
them do for us, is a rule of writing too.) Every 
writer who knows his trade perceives that he is 
a servant, that it is his business to endure hard- 
ship if only his reader may win freedom from 
toil, that no impediment to that reader’s under- 
standing is too slight to deserve diligent attention, 
that he has consequently no right to let a single 
sentence slip from him unsocialized—I mean, 
a sentence which cannot become as naturally 
another’s possession as his own. In the very act 
of asserting himself, he lays aside what is dis- 
tinctively his. And because these qualifications 
of the writer are moral qualifications, they can . 
never be completely fulfilled so long as we live 
32 i
-P-A-G-E-47
IN ENGLISH 
and write. We may continually approximate 
them more nearly, but there will still always be 
possible an alluring refinement of exercise be- 
yond. The world of the literary artist and the 
moral man is interesting through its inexhausti- 
bility: and he who serves his fellows by writing 
or by speech is artist and moral man in one. 
Writing a letter is a simple matter, but it is a 
moral matter and an artistic; for it may be done 
either with imagination or with raw self-centred- 
ness. What things will my correspondent wish 
to know? Howcan I transport him out of his 
properly alien surroundings into the vivid impres- 
sions which now are mine? How can I tell all I 
long to tell and still be sure the telling will be for 
him as lucid and delightful as for me? Remember 
the other person, I say. Do not become absorbed 
in yourself. Your interests cover only the half of 
any piece of writing; the other man’s less visible 
half is necessary to complete yours.) And if I have 
here discussed writing more than speech, that is 
merely because when we speak we utter our first 
thoughts, but when we write, our second,— or 
better still, our fourth ; and in the greater delib- 
Si)
-P-A-G-E-48
  
a SELF-CULTIVATION 
eration which writing affords I have felt that the 
demands of morality and art, which are univer- 
sally imbedded in language, could be more dis- 
tinctly perceived, Yet none the less truly do we 
need to talk for the other person than to write 
for him. 
But there remains a fourth weighty precept, 
and one not altogether detachable from the third. 
It is this: “ Lean upon your subject.” We have 
seen how the user of language, whether in writ- 
ing or in speaking, works for himself ; how he 
works for another individual too; but there is 
one more for whom his work is performed, one 
of greater consequence than any person, and that 
is his subject. From this comes his primary call. 
Those who in their utterance fix their thoughts 
on themselves, or on other selves, never reach 
power. That resides in the subject. There we 
must dwell with it, and be content to have no 
other strength than its. When the frightened 
school-boy sits down to write about Spring, he 
cannot imagine where the thoughts which are to 
make up his piece are to come from. Hecudgels 
his brain for ideas. He examines his pen-point, the 
34
-P-A-G-E-49
IN ENGLISH 
curtains, his inkstand, to see if perhaps ideas 
may not be had from these. He wonders what 
his teacher will wish him to say, and he tries to 
recall how the passage sounded in the Third 
Reader. In every direction but one he turns, and 
that is the direction where lies the prime mover 
of his toil, his subject. Of that he is afraid. Now, 
what I want to make evident is that this subject 
is not in reality the foe, but the friend. It is his 
only helper. His composition is not to be, as he 
seems to suppose, a mass of his laborious in- 
ventions, but it is to be made up exclusively of A 
what the subject dictates. He has only to attend. . “ 
At present he stands in his own way, making a 
such a din with his private anxieties that he can- eY 
not hear the rich suggestions of the subject. He 
is bothered with considering how he feels, or what 
he or somebody else will like'to see on his paper. 
This is debilitating business. He must lean on 
_his-subject, if he would have his writing strong, 
and busy himself with what it says, rather than 
with what he would say. Matthew Arnold, in the 
important preface to his poems of 1853, contrast- 
‘ng the artistic methods of Greek poetry and 
35

MTSU LIBRARY

modern poetry, sums up the teaching of the 
Greeks in these words: “ All depends upon the 
subject ; choosea fitting action, penetrate your. 
self with the feeling of its situations ; this done, 
everything else will follow.” And he calls atten- 
tion to the self-assertive and scatter-brained habits 
of our time. “ How different a way of thinking 
from this is ours! We can hardly at the present 
day understand what Menander meant, when he 
told a man who inquired as to the progress of his 
comedy that he had finished it, not having yet writ- 
ten a single line, because he had constructed the 
action of it in his mind. A modern critic would 
have assured him that the merit of his piece 
depended on the brilliant things which arose 
under his pen as he went along. I verily think 
that the majority of us do not in our hearts 
believe that there is such a thing as a total im- 
pression to be derived from a poem, or to be 
demanded from a poet. We permit the poet to 
select any action he pleases, and to suffer that 
action to go as it will, provided he gratifies us 
with occasional bursts of fine writing, and with 
a shower of isolated thoughts and images.”

Great writers put themselves and their personal 
imaginings out of sight. Their writing becomes 
a kind of transparent window on which reality 
is reflected, and through which people see, not 
them, but that of which they write. How much 
we know of Shakespeare’s characters! How little 
of Shakespeare! Of him that might almost be said 
which Isaiah said of God, “ He hideth himself.” 
The best writer is the best mental listener, the 
one who peers farthest into his matter and most 
fully heeds its behests. Preéminently obedient 
is the strong writer,—refinedly, energetically 
obedient. I once spent a day with a great novelist 
when the book which subsequently proved his 
masterpiece was only half written. I praised his 
mighty hero, but said I should think the life of an 
author would be miserable who, having created 
acharacterso huge, now had him in hand and must 
find something for him to do. My friend seemed 
puzzled by my remark, but after a moment’s pause 
said, “I don’t think you know how we work. I 
have nothing to do with the character. Now that 
he is created, he will act as he will.” 
And such docility must be cultivated by every

one who would write well, such strenuous do- 
cility. Of course there must be energy-in plenty ; 
the imagination which I described in my third 
section, the passion for solid form as in my 
second, the disciplined and daring powers as in 
my first; but all these must be ready at a 
moment’s notice to move where the matter calls 
and to acknowledge that all their worth is to be 
drawn from it. Religion is only enlarged good 
sense, and the words of Jesus apply as well to 
the things of earth as of heaven. I do not know 
where we could find a more compendious state- 
ment of what is most important for one to learn 
who would cultivate himself in English than the 
simple saying in which Jesus announces the 
source of his power. “ The word which ye hear 
is not mine, but the Father’s which sent me.” 
Whoever can use such words will be a noble 
speaker indeed. 
/These, then, are the fundamental precepts 
hich every one must heed who would command 
r beautiful English language. There is, of 
course, a fifth. I hardly need to name it ; for it 
always follows after, whatever others precede. 
38
-P-A-G-E-53
  
IN ENGLISH 
It is that we should do the work, and not think 
about it ; do it day after day and not grow weary 
in bad doing. Early and often we must be busy, 
and be satisfied to have a great deal of labor 
produce but a small result. I am told that early 
in life John Morley, wishing to engage in jour- 
nalism, wrote an editorial and sent it to a paper 
every day for nearly a year before he succeeded 
in getting one accepted. We all know what a 
power he became in London journalism. I will 
not vouch for the truth of this story, but I am 
sure an ambitious author is wise who writes 
a weekly essay for his stove. Publication is of 
little consequence, so long as one is getting one’s 
self hammered into shape. 
But before I close this address, let me acknow- 
ledge that in it I have neglected a whole class of 
helpful influences, probably quite as important 
as any I have discussed. Purposely I have passed 
them by. Because I wished to show what we can 
do for ourselves, I have everywhere assumed 
that our cultivation in English is to be effected 
by naked volition and a kind of dead lift. These 
are mighty agencies, but seldom in this inter-

locked world do they work well alone. \They are 
strongest when backed by social suggestion and 
unconscious custom,) Ordinarily the good speaker 
is he who keepS good company, but increases 
the helpful influence of that company by con- 
stant watchfulness along the lines I have marked 
out. So supplemented, my teaching is true. By 
itself it is not true. It needs the supplementation 
of others. Let him who would speak or write 
well seek out good speakers and writers. Let 
him live in their society, — for the society of the 
greatest writers is open to the most secluded, — 
let him feel the ease of their excellence, the in- 
genuity, grace, and scope of their diction, and he 
will soon find in himself capacities whose devel- 
opment may be aided by the precepts I have 
given. Most of us catch better than we learn, 
We take up unconsciously from our surroundings 
what we cannot altogether create. All this should 
be remembered, and we should keep ourselves 
exposed to the wholesome words of our fellow- 
men. Yet our own exertions will not on that 
account be rendered less important. We may 
largely choose the influences to which we sub- 
40
-P-A-G-E-55
  IN ENGLISH 
mit; we may exercise a selective attention among 
these influences ; we may enjoy, oppose, modify, 
or diligently ingraft what is conveyed to us,— 
and for doing any one of these things rationally 
we must be guided bysome clear aim. Such aims, 
altogether essential even if subsidiary, I have 
sought to supply ; and I would reiterate that he 
who holds them fast may become superior to 
linguistic fortune and be the wise director of his 
sluggish and obstinate tongue. It is as certain as 
anything can be that faithful endeavor will bring 
expertness in the use of English.Uf we are watch- 
ful of our speech, making a words continually 
more minutely frue, free, and resourceful ; if we 
look upon our occasions of writing as opportuni- 
ties for the deliberate work of unified construc- 
tion; if in all our utterances we think of him who 
hears as well as of him who speaks ; and above all, 
if we fix the attention of ourselvesand our hearers 
on the matter we talk about and so let ourselves

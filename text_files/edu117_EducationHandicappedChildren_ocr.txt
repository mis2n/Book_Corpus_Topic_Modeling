     EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Durine the past quarter-century our States have enacted 
a large amount of compulsory-education and child-welfare 
legislation, and one of the results of the enforcement of these 
laws has been to throw a new burden on the public schools. 
Not only have the truant and the incorrigible been brought 
into the schools in consequence, but also many children suf- 
fering from physical defects and disorders as well as those of 
low mentality. As a result our schools have experienced 
great difficulty in handling such children, and an educational 
problem has been created with which we formerly did not 
have to deal to any such extent as at present. Another re- 
sult of such legislation, which has brought into the school 
children who are crippled, deaf, suffering from speech or 
visual defects, the mentally deficient, the feeble-minded, 
the mentally disordered, and the moral delinquent, has 
been to awaken public expectations which it has been hard 
for the school to fulfill. ‘The school has been forced to meet 
the problem as best it could, and out of the study of the 
needs of such handicapped children it has tried to devise 
forms of instruction that will enable it to render real 
service to them. 
For children suffering from physical defects, whether 
remediable or not, much ean and is being done by our 
schools. For all but the lowest grade of mentally deficient 
children, too, much also can be done. The latter it is possi- 
ble to educate to a degree, to train and improve them, and to 
guide them vocationally. While we know that mental de- 
ficiency is incurable, in a medical sense, and that by educa- 
tion we cannot make over a mentally deficient child into a 
normal child, we have found that it is nevertheless possible

   to organize and condition his behavior, to train him for cer- 
tain forms of employment where he can make a reasonable 
success, to build up an educational program for him that will 
meet his individual needs, to help establish him in earning 
service, and to make his life comparatively contented and 
reasonably safe for society. 
The problem for the school, as it relates to these special 
classes of children, we have found, is one of diagnosis, proper 
classification, curriculum adjustment, restatement of edu- 
cational objectives, revision of teaching methods, differen- 
tiated instruction, and proper training and habit formation, 
with a view to the removal, in so far as is possible, of the 
social menace of those children who enter school life in a 
handicapped physical or mental condition. In studying the 
needs of these special classes of children, a flood of light has 
been thrown as well on our school practices as they relate 
to the handling of those backward, misbehaved, and mal- 
adjusted individuals who often cause our teachers much 
trouble and the school much loss of time and energy. 
A careful analysis of this fundamental educational pro- 
blem is of much importance to all those charged with the re- 
sponsibility of the direction of public education, and the 
editor of this series of textbooks feels that he is fortunate in 
being able to present, in this volume, the carefully organized 
results of years of careful clinical study of thousands of 
handicapped children, as found in a number of our large pub- 
lic-school systems and child-welfare clinics. The author has 
been able to organize his results so that the volume forms an 
excellent textbook for use by our schools of education in 
studying the problem, and also an excellent guide for practi- 
cal workers in any line of service that deals with the care or 
training of handicapped children.

  PREFACE 
Tuis text is the outgrowth of a course of lectures delivered 
year by year in six universities and one college of education 
since 1912. Although the lectures appear here substantially 
as delivered during this period, they have been considerably 
condensed in places and embody revisions made from time 
to time in keeping with the growth of the science. 
Many topics have necessarily been treated briefly, be- 
cause of the imposed limitations of the scope of the book, or 
because they will be treated in more detail in a projected 
companion text based on a parallel series of lectures in clin- 
ical psychology and psychopathology, or because the de- 
tailed argumentative or experimental evidence on which 
many of the conclusions are based has already appeared in 
print, or because certain topics have already been ade- 
quately treated by other writers. Moreover, it seems to the 
author eminently desirable to leave ample opportunity for 
the instructor to supplement the treatment in the text by 
his own discussions and reports from the contributions of 
other writers. 
The conclusions which are reached in the book represent 
the outcome, not only of the writer’s study of the literature, 
but of his own reflections, experiences, and experiments 
during nearly a decade and a half devoted almost wholly to 
the clinical examination of many thousands of abnormal 
children of diverse types in institutions for the epileptic, 
feeble-minded, and mentally disordered, in two university 
clinics, and in many public school systems, to the super- 
vision and administration of special classes in the public
-P-A-G-E-12

schools, and to the training of teachers for such classes. 
Many of the results of this labor have already appeared in 
cael monographs and memoirs. The publication of 
this book has been intentionally deferred, in order that it 
might embody the writer’s matured convictions and con- 
clusions after years of unremitting study of the problems 
involved, and after subjecting various theories to crucial 
test in the field of practical public school administration. 
It would be impossible to express adequately the stimu- 
lation, enlightenment, and challenge to my own thinking 
which have been derived from the study of the publications 
of the recognized psychological, educational, sociological, 
and medical authorities in the field of mental defects and 
deficiency. I have perused this teeming literature with a 
sympathetic mind, although frequently forced to take issue 
with some of the conclusions reached by my contemporaries. 
The limitations of an introductory treatise necessarily for- 
bid extensive citations or exhaustive lists of references. 
In the selection of topics and the construction of the book 
the writer has had particularly in mind the needs of spe- 
cial class teachers, school administrators, educationists, and 
psychologists, but it will probably also be of interest to 
social workers, sociologists, and neuropsychiatrists. While 
the discussion is largely concerned with children of inferior 
mental endowment, a brief outline is given of the basic re- 
quirements for the organization of special classes or differ- 
entiated training for various other types of handicapped 
children. The aim has been to make the treatment as simple 
and non-technical as possible, without sacrificing scientific 
accuracy. It should be remembered, however, that many 
conclusions in this field must still be held tentatively: the 
science of mental defect and inefficiency has a long way to 
travel yet before it will reach anything approaching finality.

  THE EDUCATION OF 
HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
CHAPTER I 
LAYING THE FOUNDATIONS FOR THE ORGANIZED 
CARE AND TRAINING OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
Tuis brief historical sketch will be largely restricted to a 
summary of the most significant trends in the development 
of the social care, educational training, and scientific inves- 
tigation of feeble-minded and backward children. I have 
treated the subject in greater detail in the references given 
at the end of the chapter. Roughly, four historical epochs 
may be distinguished in the progress of the movement. 
The ancient period. In general, during ancient times it 
was considered that the feeble-minded were extra-social and 
devoid of human rights, because they were too solitary or 
peculiar (hence called “‘idiots”), or because they were 
“demons possessed” who were “accursed of the gods.” 
They were treated with indifference, aversion, contempt, 
ridicule, or neglect, or were cruelly persecuted and even ex- 
terminated, sometimes being abandoned in the mountains 
to die from starvation or to be devoured by wild animals, 
and sometimes thrown into the rivers to succumb from 
drowning. Deliberate neglect or abandonment of idiots 
was countenanced by the laws of Lycurgus, and practiced 
by the Spartans from eugenic motives. It has also been 
practiced by inferior races during more recent times, while 
some scientists and social workers in enlightened nations
-P-A-G-E-22
4 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
still advocate resort to euthanasia as the most rational 
method of dealing with the problem of the incurable defec- 
tive. 
But a more tolerant attitude gradually emerged. It is 
said that imbeciles became objects of diversion and amuse- 
ment, particularly among the Romans, Seneca’s wife keep- 
ing a blind imbecile (fatua) for this purpose. The statement 
that a few feeble-minded among the ancients rose to posi- 
tions of influence, and even wore the royal purple, is prob- 
ably based on fallacious diagnoses. There is no evidence 
that Nero, Commodus, Elagabalus, or Caligula — four 
cases in point — were feeble-minded, although they may 
have been mentally abnormal, deranged, profligate, morally 
perverse, or cruelly vindictive. 
The Christian era. The care of the feeble-minded, as well 
as the “‘demoniac,” the physically infirm or afflicted, and the 
poor was enjoined by Christ, Confucius, Zoroaster, and Mo- 
hammed. Under the liberalizing influence of Christianity 
the mentally defective became objects of commiseration, 
solicitude, and care. While the Bishop of Myra (the “Saint 
Nicholas” of that age) set on foot charitable efforts for their 
care and protection as early as the fourth century, no effort 
was made to train or educate imbeciles during this period. 
They were, at best, merely protected, housed, clothed, and 
fed. 
The medieval ages. The attitude assumed toward im- 
beciles was quite vacillating during medieval times. These 
“simpletons,” according to belief, were the first court 
“fools” or jesters, and the buffoons who furnished some of 
the entertainment in the castles of the rich. Or they were 
exalted in public estimation to the rank of ‘“‘heavenly in- 
fants,” or “infants of the good God” (the French word for 
cretin means Christian), who were supposed to enjoy the 
special favor and protection of God, and whose sense-
-P-A-G-E-23
  ORGANIZED CARE AND TRAINING 5 
less jabberings were listened to and regarded as heavenly 
communications, even by the learned Tycho Brahe, who 
had a fool for his companion in the astronomical observa- 
tory. Houses in which. feeble-minded children were born 
were thought to be divinely blessed. During this period of 
superstitious reverence, the feeble-minded in Europe were 
accorded special privileges and allowed to roam unmolested. 
It is reported that this attitude has persisted to more recent 
times in parts of Ireland and Brittany, and in Brazil and 
Turkey. In Brazil, if reports can be accepted, defective 
children are allowed to roam the highways and byways 
soliciting alms, and may thus support a whole family, as 
they are rarely refused. In Turkey they have been given 
special privileges as weird, sacred beings. Some American 
Indian tribes allowed these “‘Children of the Great Spirit” 
to roam about unharmed. During the reign of Edward IT 
(1807-27) England placed “natural fools” under regal pro- 
tection, requiring the king to administer their estates in their 
interest. 
But persecution usually follows in the wake of supersti- 
tion, bigotry, and religious fanaticism. The practice of the 
ancient cruelties was brought back during the period of the 
Renaissance and the Reformation. Even Luther and Cal- 
vin openly denounced imbeciles as evil spirits, ‘‘filled with 
Satan.” They were sometimes scourged in the vain attempt 
to exorcise the infesting demons. But the practice of cruel 
inflictions gradually waned with the acceptance of more 
humane views, and with the organization of efforts looking 
toward the beneficent protection and institutional care of 
the feeble-minded. This movement was perhaps first in- 
augurated in France ! by Saint Vincent de Paul (1576-1660) * 
and his “Sisters of Charity” who gathered together in the 
1 According to G. A. Auden the first colony for the feeble-minded was 
founded in Belgium in the thirteenth century in memory of Saint Dympna.

  6 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
Bicétre (a famous Parisian hospital and asylum, formerly a 
chateau) the homeless, the outcast, and the bodily and men- 
tally infirm. But little or no attempt was made during this 
period scientifically to study their mental condition and 
needs, or to treat, train, or educate the imbecile class. 
While the development of the scientific study of mentally 
inferior children and of the science and art of differential 
training adapted to their needs was still some distance in 
the future, the beginning of this movement can be directly 
traced to the first attempts made to supply differential 
training for the deaf, which marks the turning-point be- 
tween the medieval and modern period. 
The modern or scientific period. The pioneers in the 
field of corrective education were Juan Pablo Bonet (or 
Bonnet; d. 1629?), a Spaniard, and Jacob Rodrigues Pereire 
(or Pereira; 1715-80), a Spanish Jew, of Portuguese ex- 
traction, who was learned in many sciences, who conducted 
schools for the deaf in Bordeaux and Paris, and who gave 
forty years of his life to the education of this class of defec- 
tives. 
Bonet and Pereire. Bonet! originated the manual alpha- 
bet for the deaf, published in Madrid in 1620. Pereire, who 
became interested in the education of the deaf at Bordeaux, 
where he met a girl who was congenitally deaf, extended 
Bonet’s alphabet into a one-handed dactylology of forty 
signs (the signs in present use are shown in Fig. 1), utilized 
pantomimic expression, and, his lasting monument to fame, 
invented the oral method (lip reading) by means of which 
many deaf have since been taught to speak and to apprehend 
spoken words. Pereire devised this method as the result of 
the theory that touch is the primitive sense, that all special 
senses are derivative modifications of touch, and, therefore, 
1 It has been asserted that Bonet merely put into practice the theories 
of Ponce de Leon (1520-84), a Spanish Benedictine monk,
-P-A-G-E-25
ORGANIZED CARE AND TRAINING 7 
that it should be possible through appropriate training to 
make touch function vicariously for hearing. The success of 
this method is now well known. The deaf can be taught

-P-A-G-E-26
  8 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
to understand speech, not chiefly, however, through the 
tactual apprehension of the vibrations emitted by the voice- 
producing mechanism, but mainly by the visual apprehen- 
sion of the movements of the speech organs, and to speak 
by imitating the movements made in voice production. 
Value of Pereire’s contribution. Pereire rendered an in- 
estimable service, not only to the deaf, to whom he opened a 
new world, but also to educational science, and, in recogni- 
tion of his brilliant achievement, was awarded a pension by 
Louis XV, while the oral method received the official com- 
mendation of a specially appointed committee of the Pari- 
sian Academy of Science. There has perhaps been no achieve- 
ment in the whole realm of remedial pedagogy or educa- 
tional rehabilitation quite equal to the feat of teaching a 
deaf child who may never have heard a spoken word and 
who is even unable to hear his own voice, to speak and ap- 
prehend speech. It is much more difficult to reach the deaf 
than the blind, for the deaf are deprived of the greatest 
stimulus to mental growth, namely, spoken language. In 
consequence, the congenitally deaf child enters school like a 
baby of two or three years, as regards language and some- 
times general information, while his blind brother who hears, 
understands, and is able to use speech, has, by virtue of these 
advantages, acquired a large fund of information denied the 
deaf child and may enter on an intellectual equality with his 
normal playfellows. 
Schools for the deaf. The success of Pereire’s work en- 
couraged the establishment of other schools for the deaf, 
and led to the inauguration of educational training for the 
blind and eventually for the feeble-minded.' Schools for 
1 Pereire may have exerted an influence on general educational theory 
through his neighbor, Rousseau, who visited Pereire’s school, and who was 
one of the first educational writers to advocate the training of the senses of 
young children. The influence was obviously reciprocal. The practice of

the deaf were opened by Thomas Braidwood in Edinburgh in 
1760, by the Abbé de l’E:pée (1712-89) in Paris in 1771, whose 
methods apparently were largely confined to pantomimic 
signs and finger spellings, and by Samuel Heinike (1729-90) 
in Germany, who seems to have conducted a pure oralist 
school. It is alleged that Pereire’s contemporaries failed to 
grasp his method because he tried to keep it a secret, and the 
oral method languished until the middle of the eighteenth 
century. It was not transplanted to America until 1867 — 
a century and a quarter after its inception — perhaps partly 
because of the controversy regarding the sufficiency of the 
pure oral method, which is still waged by the pure oralists 
and the advocates of the “combined method.” If reports 
are correct, the oral method was first introduced here in 1867 
by the Clarke Institution in Massachusetts and by a school 
in New York City. A long time before this, in 1816, Thomas 
/Gallaudet established the first school for the deaf, in Hart- 
- | ford, using the sign alphabet which he had observed in 
\France. Kentucky established the first State school for 
the deaf in 1823, followed by Ohio, in 1827. Boston is cred- 
ited with having established the first public day school for 
oral instruction, in 1869 (named after Horace Mann, a pro- 
tagonist of the pure oral method, which he had studied in 
Germany). 
Statistics on United States schools. According to Bulle- 
tin No. 52, 1923, of the Bureau of Education, all the States 
except Delaware, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, 
and Wyoming maintained State schools for the deaf in 1922. 
At that time 154 of 160 schools reporting to the Bureau in- 
cluded 61 State or semi-State institutions (15 institutions in 
13 States being for both deaf and blind pupils), 74 city day 
Pereire probably reflects more or less Rousseau’s educational philosophy. 
The specific details in Rousseau’s system were probably derived from the 
practices observed in Pereire’s school.

schools, and 19 private schools. The enrollment in the 
State schools was 10,738, in the city day schools, 2911, and 
in the private schools 716, or a total of 14,365. The “cur- 
rent expenses and outlays per pupil” were $618 in the 
State schools and $846 in the private schools. Fourteen 
of the public school classes, thirteen State institutions, and 
eleven of seventeen private schools used the oral method 
exclusively. The others probably used the “combined 
method” — the oral, the pantomimic, and the manual. 
The rapid extention of the oral method is partly due to the 
agitation conducted by various organizations established 
with a view to securing its exclusive adoption. Some States 
require by law the use of the oral method. 
Most, if not all, of the public school classes and institu- 
tions for the deaf admit pupils who are hard of hearing, but 
not deaf. Little has so far been accomplished in the organ- 
ization of separate hearing conservation classes for the par- 
tially deaf. 
The education of the blind. The first school for the blind 
was established by Valentine Hatiy in Paris in 1784, who 
trained the pupils to read embossed books by the finger, such 
books being first published in Paris, in 1786. The instruc- 
tion of the blind began in England in 1791, in Austria in 
1804, in Prussia in 1806, in Holland in 1808, in Sweden in 
1810, in Denmark in 1811, in Scotland in 1812, in Boston 
and New York in 1832, and in Philadelphia in 1833. All of 
the first American schools were private. The first kinder- 
garten for blind children was established in Germany in 
1861, and the first school for the colored blind in North Caro- 
lina in 1869. The first public school class for the blind in 
the United States was opened in Chicago in 1900. The wel- 
fare of the blind has been greatly furthered in the United 
States by congressional aid which has been voted the Ameri- 
can Printing House for the Blind at Louisville since March,
-P-A-G-E-29
  ORGANIZED CARE AND TRAINING ll 
1879, the aid now amounting to $50,000 per annum. In ad- 
dition, the franking privilege is accorded embossed books, 
which are loaned to the blind by anes libraries and insti- 
tutions. 
United States school statistics. In 1922 State schools for 
the blind were maintained by all of our States except Dela- 
ware, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, 
Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wyoming, and the District of 
Columbia. Montana evidently trains the blind, deaf, and 
feeble-minded in the same institution. There were forty- 
eight State institutions, one public institution in Porto Rico, 
sixteen city day schools, and eight private institutions. The 
sixty-four schools reporting the data had enrolled 4947 pu- 
pils. Adding 655 pupils from nine other schools listed in 
earlier reports gives a total enrollment of approximately 
6600. One hundred and ninety-one city public school sys- 
tems maintained elasses for children with eye handicaps, in- 
cluding classes for the blind and sight-saving classes. The 
sight-conservation classes for the partially sighted or vis- 
ually handicapped (who are not blind) represent a compar- 
atively recent educational innovation, the first classes hav- 
ing been established in Roxbury, Massachusetts, in April, 
1913, and in Cleveland, Ohio, in the fall of 1913. In 1924 
there were about one hundred and eighty such classes in 
various public school systems. Massachusetts, New York, 
and Ohio have led the way in the introduction of these 
classes in this country. 
Styles of type. Two styles of embossed type are in use 
among the blind, the line types and the point types. The 
Braille, devised in 1825, has survived among three compet- 
ing systems of point types which have vied for supremacy. 
The line types are imitations of the letters of the alphabet, 
the only survivor of which is the large, coarse Moon’s type, 
used by the old and infirm. Since 1919, all books in the

Itard and the education of the feeble-minded. Jean 
Marc Gaspard Itard (1775-1838), French otologist, physi- 
cian to an institution for the deaf in Paris, and philosopher, 
familiar with Periere’s educational method and Rousseau’s 
theories, and interested in the solution of the controversy 
between the empiricists and nativists | regarding the origin 
of ideas, was the first to undertake the systematic training 
of a low-grade mental defective, the so-called savage of 
Aveyron, who was the first “wolf boy” to receive educa- 
tional training.” 
Savage of Aveyron. This eleven- or twelve-year-old boy 
was found in 1798 by huntsmen in the woods of Caune in 
the Department of Aveyron, in the southern part of France, 
roaming the forest in search of acorns and nuts, walking 
on all fours, drinking water while lying flat on the ground, 
biting and scratching those who attempted to interfere 
with him, unclothed and unable to speak. 
Brought to Paris and presented before the Academy of 
Science, he aroused much interest. Pinel, the distinguished 
specialist on the mentally disordered at the Bicétre, pro- 
nounced him an idiot and therefore incapable of being taught 
anything. Itard, on the other hand, who was an empiricist, 
held that he was merely wild, unta:.ght, and mentally ar- 
rested because of social and educational neglect — a case of 
1 According to empiricism (or sensationalism) everything comes from 
experience or sensations: the mind is a tabula rasa before being acted on by 
stimuli. According to nativism, ideas are potentially present in the mind, 
and need only the play of environmental stimuli to make them explicit. 
Stimuli only develop what is originally present in germinal form. In edu- 
cation the same controversy appears in the antithetical query: Is teaching 
primarily an instructing or pouring in process, or an educating or drawing 
out process? 
2 According to Karl von Linné, ten “wolf boys” were found between 1544 
and 1767 living among wolves, bears, wild sheep, and oxen.

mental atrophy through~disuse, or “idiocy through isola- 
tion” — and that he could be greatly improved or restored 
to normality by exciting his nervous sensibility with varied 
and energetic:stimuli, by.supplying his mind with the raw 
impressions of ideas, by the imitative development of speech, 
by applying his mind to the satisfaction of his growing 
physical wants, by arousing new social needs, and by en- 
dearing him to social life. Partly because he wanted to 
demonstrate the truth of this theory and the correctness of 
empiricism, Itard undertook to lead the boy by gradual 
steps “from natural life to social life” and “from savagery to 
civilization.” After a year of exceedingly arduous and de- 
voted labor, Itard modified his methods, without having 
openly acknowledged that his diagnosis had been mistaken, 
and adopted methods more consonant with the needs of an 
idiot or low imbecile than a normal savage. After four 
years of the most systematic and painstaking course of 
sense training on record (supplemented by attempts to 
teach reading, writing, and to develop speech, comprehen- 
sion of spoken language and power to generalize) and of the 
individual (clinical) study of the educational needs of one 
child, Itard, in deep disappointment, dismissed his pupil 
precipitately because, at the onset of puberty, the boy broke 
out in a “wild storm of passion,” and Itard felt that he had 
failed in his mission. 
Itard’s contribution. The French Academy of Science, 
however, recognized that Itard had made a positive con- 
tribution to educational science, and commended him for 
his ingenuity, sagacity, courage, and patience, pointing out 
that distinct changes had taken place in the boy during his 
five years of training. He had learned to make relatively 
fine sensory discriminations, to recognize objects, to identify 
1 Itard is said to have generalized Pereire’s touch training and specialized 
Rousseau’s theories in his educational program.

16 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
the letters of the alphabet, to read a little (although he 
understood little that he read), to comprehend the meaning 
of many words, to apply names to objects and parts of ob- 
jects, to use adjectives and verbs, to copy words, to write 
words from memory, to write words expressing his wants 
(although unable to comprehend written communications), 
to speak a few syllables, to make some generalizations, and 
to prefer the food and social life of civilization to isolated 
existence in the wild. Itard, in fact, had demonstrated that 
even idiots or low-grade imbeciles (the boy was no doubt the 
one or the other) can be improved more or less by appro- 
priate training. Moreover, perhaps Itard enjoys the dis- 
tinction of being the first educator to apply thoroughly the 
individual or clinical method to the study and observation 
of the pupil in the way in which patients are clinically ex- 
amined in a hospital. The necessity for this method had 
earlier been pointed out by John Locke (1632-1704), who 
had emphasized that pupils should be individually diag- 
nosed in school because their minds differ just as their 
bodies do. 
Seguin. Itard’s method was modified, systematized, and 
elaborated by his able pupil and fellow countryman, Edwin 
Seguin (1812-80), who was also a pupil of Jean Esquirol 
(1772-1840), who was one of the first physicians to define 
idiocy as a condition of arrested development and not a dis- 
ease. Seguin, first a teacher, and then a physician and psy- 
chologist, devoted the best forty-two years of his life to the 
study and training of the feeble-minded, and became, in 
truth, the inspiring prophet of the best work done since his 
day for the amelioration of the lot of the feeble-minded. 
H. Holman rates him as “one of the world’s greatest educa- 
tional investigators and reformers.” Seguin entered upon 
his great work inspired by unbounded faith in the great po- 
tentialities of human nature, and imbued with the deter-
-P-A-G-E-35
  
ORGANIZED CARE AND TRAINING 17 
mination of devising a system of education, based upon the 
“principles of physiology,” which should embrace “every 
faculty, function, and aptitude,” which would be superior to 
ordinary book training both for the subnormal and for the 
normal, and which would eventually lead to the regenera- 
tion of mankind. _ 
Seguin’s method. Seguin’s “physiological education,’ 
contained in his great book on The Moral Treatment, Hy- 
giene, and Education of Idiots and Other Backward Children, 
published in 1846 (“‘the Magna Charta of the emancipation 
of the imbecile class,” which was crowned by the French 
Academy and commended in an autographed letter by Pope 
Pius IX for the service its author had rendered humanity '), 
is essentially a system of sensori-motor training designed to 
develop imperfect sense organs both as “‘faculties and func- 
tions,” and to refine discriminative sensitivity, which is 
supplemented by literary, intellectual, moral, and industrial 
training. Seguin proposed to develop the “imperfect sense- 
organs” of the defectives by exercising them. He aimed 
“to lead the child from the education of the muscular system 
to that of the nervous system and the senses,” and “from 
the education of the senses to general notions, from general 
notions to abstract thought, from abstract thought to mo- 
rality.” The child, he said, should be trained to move and 
feel (the training of motility and sensibility), as well as to 
cognize and moralize. Although employing specially de- 
vised didactic apparatus for the formal training of the senses 
and muscles, each set more or less in isolation, Seguin’s 
view probably was that the sensori-motor and intellectual 
training should go hand in hand. He asserts that the exer- 
cise of a given “function” (probably referring to the physi- 
ological activity) should be accompanied by the exercise of > 
1 According to one authority the book so honored was the Theory and 
Practice of the Education of Idiots (1842).  
-P-A-G-E-36
  18 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
the “related faculty” (probably referring to the mental ac- 
tivity), for the “exclusive training of the function” impairs 
the “faculty,” and “the exclusive training of the faculty at- 
rophies the function.” The “function of the senses” evolves 
into and eventuates in “intellectual faculty.” The “sensa- 
tions” become “idealized” by the process of comparison 
(the “principle of contrast”), which seems to be Seguin’s 
fundamental teaching principle. Moreover, Seguin empha- 
sized that as soon as slight use had been developed in a func- 
tion it should be elevated to a “capacity,” and applied to 
some useful purpose. He emphasized that the teacher must 
fail in her function if she does not get beyond the didactic 
material and formal processes of training and call to the soul 
of the child. The work of the true teachers of mental de- 
fectives, as he conceived, must become a mission, a conse- 
cration, a noble passion for the service of one of humanity’s 
most unfortunate classes. It will repay every teacher of 
mental defectives thoroughly to familiarize herself with 
Seguin’s method by a careful perusal of his Idiocy: and Its 
Treatment by the Physiological Method, published by"Teach- 
ers College, Columbia University. 
After establishing the first successful school expressly insti- 
tuted for the training of the feeble-minded in Paris in 1837, 
and directing the reéstablished school at the Bicétre (1842) 
for a year, and a private school for a few years, Seguin, at 
the time of the Revolution in 1848, emigrated to America, 
where he assisted in the organization of the first American 
1 Earlier short-lived schools had been established at Salzburg, Austria- 
in 1828, by Guggenmoos (established in 1816 and closed in 1835, according 
to E. P. Cubberley), at Wildberg in 1835 by Haldenwang, both for cretins, 
at the Bicétre in 1828 by Ferrus, and again in 1839 by Voisin, at the Sal- 
pétriére in 1831 by Falret, while Voisin opened a private school in 1833. 
In America, educational training had been given on a small scale to limited 
numbers of feeble-minded children in the American Asylum for the Deaf 
and Dumb in Hartford in 1818, and in the Perkins Institute for the Blind in 
Boston, possibly as early as 1848,
-P-A-G-E-37
ORGANIZED CARE AND TRAINING 19 
institutions for the feeble-minded. He served for a short 
time as the superintendent of the “Massachusetts School 
for Idiotic and Feeble-Minded Youth,” at that time located 
in South Boston, assisted in the organization of the State 
institution at Syracuse, New York, and was associated for a 
while in the direction of the ‘ «Pennsylvania ‘Training School 
for Idiotic and Feeble-Minded Children” in Philadelphia, 
which is now located at Elwyn. He opened a private school 
in New York City in January, 1880, which is now located in 
Orange, New Jersey. His work became the model and in- 
spiration of the best subsequent educational work and secial 
care for the feeble-minded undertaken in both publicly and 
privately supported institutions in America. 
France’s unique contribution. It is thus apparent that 
France enjoys the distinction of having originated the mod- 
ern science of corrective pedagogy. To France we owe 
the oral method for training the deaf, the embossed type 
for training the blind to read, the “‘physiological method” 
for training the feeble-minded — and more recently the 
Binet-Simon “method for measuring the development of 
the intelligence of young children,” which has greatly stim- 
ulated the establishment of special classes for subnormals. 
Guggenbiihl and Saegert. Conspicuous among Seguin’s 
contemporaries were Guggenbiihl (d. 1865), and M. Saegert. 
Guggenbihl, the “patron saint” to the cretins, opened a 
colony for their education and care in 1842 at an elevation 
of four thousand feet above sea level on the Abendberg, the 
“Sacred Mount,” near Interlaken, in Canton Berne, Switzer- 
land — perhaps the first institution constructed on the cot- 
tage plan — which rapidly attained fame and attracted vis- 
iting scientists, physicians, kings, and philanthropists from 
many lands, but which came to an inglorious, untimely end, 
evidently because of the abuses which had crept into the in- 
stitution during Guggenbiihl’s frequent pilgrimages, and 
   
-P-A-G-E-38
20 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
because the reports of the results accomplished had been 
overdrawn. 
Saegert, in Germany, experimented with the method of 
“physiological education” on a few low-grade mental de- 
fectives in the Asylum for Deaf Mutes in Berlin, and in 1842 
(or 1845 according to M. W. Barr) founded a private “Insti- 
tution for the Cure and Education of Idiots,” the first school 
in Germany for the feeble-minded, which attracted many 
visitors, became an inspiration to workers in Germany and 
other lands, and according to report, still continues as a de- 
partment of a hospital for the mentally disordered. 
Montessori. The outstanding modern disciple of Itard 
and Seguin is Maria Montessori, who became interested in 
the education of the feeble-minded while connected with the 
psychiatric clinic of the University of Rome and who, in con- 
sequence of the conviction reached in 1897 that “mental 
deficiency presented chiefly a pedagogical rather than mainly 
a medical problem,” made a painstaking study of the works 
of Itard and Seguin, which she translated into Italian from 
“beginning to end” in order that she might “have time to 
weigh the sense of each word” and get “the spirit of the au- 
thor.” The “Montessori system” is, in part, an adaptation 
of the system of “physiological education” of Itard and 
Seguin. She freely admits that she got her spiritual key 
from Seguin. Many of her didactic materials far improving 
and refining sensory discrimination are largely modifica- 
tions or refinements of Itard’s or Seguin’s appliances. She 
follows her masters in the use of the method of formal sense- 
training. She includes exercises for practical life, as did 
Seguin, and became possessed of the “controlling idea,” fol- 
lowing Seguin, that the method was applicable to normal 
children from three to seven. But she goes beyond Seguin 
in actually applying the method to normal children of the 
masses in the House of Childhood which she organized in

January, 1907, in certain tenements in Rome, and in train- 
ing teachers (or “‘directresses”) for conducting such schools 
or houses. She has, moreover, reémphasized a number of 
vital educational principles, such as the principles of de- 
velopment — the unfoldment of the child’s latent impulses 
— and of individuality, previously emphasized by Locke, 
Rousseau, Froebel, and Seguin; the necessity for the individ- 
ual study of children, particularly the need of observing their 
spontaneous behavior and interests, foreshadowed by Locke, 
Itard, and Seguin; and the importance of giving children 
freedom and liberty of action, emphasized by Rousseau and 
Froebel, but which, rather paradoxically, they enjoy only to 
a limited degree when using the Montessori educational ap- 
paratus. The system, which has more recently been ex- 
tended to older children, and which has called forth a mass 
of laudatory and condemnatory dissertations and reviews, 
possesses more value for the training of defectives than has 
been conceded by the captious critic.

CHAPTER II 
SUBSEQUENT TRENDS IN CONSTRUCTIVE WORK 
FOR THE MENTALLY HANDICAPPED 
To attempt to trace in detail the growth and development 
during the last three quarters of a century of the special care 
and training given all types of handicapped children would 
be quite impossible within the prescribed limits of this vol- 
ume. A brief summary will, however, be given of the signifi- 
cant trends in the program of work carried out in the interest 
of mentally inferior children since the middle of the last 
century. 
1. Insrirurionat anp CoLony CaRE FOR THE 
Fresie-MiInpED 
Through the vigorous propaganda waged in speech and 
writing by individuals and associations interested in the so- 
cial, educational, psychological, medical, and eugenic as- 
pects of mental defectiveness, public and private institu- 
tions for the care of the feeble-minded have been established 
in most of the civilized countries of the earth. Only meager 
reports are available of the post-war developments in Eu- 
rope. Before the war the most generous institutional ac- 
commodations were afforded by Germany, England, Sweden, 
Denmark, and Switzerland. Brief reference will be made 
only to the work in Germany and England. 
Germany. From 1846 to 1881, Germany established 
thirty-five training institutions for the feeble-minded (many 
containing epileptics), some built on very elaborate lines 
as model institutions. All are under Government control 
although many are supported by ecclesiastical organiza-

tions. All the teachers must hold licenses from the Govern- 
ment. 
England. In England the first school for imbeciles was es- 
tablished by private subvention at Bath in.1846, now con- 
ducted as Rock Hall House School by the trustees of the 
Municipal Charities of Bath, while Park House, the prede- 
cessor of Earlswood and of the Eastern Counties Asylum at 
Colchester, was founded in 1848. 
The English Mental Deficiency Act. Through the passage 
of the Mental Deficiency Act of 1913 (which repealed the 
Idiot’s Act of 1886), England of all countries has perhaps de- 
veloped the most comprehensive system of guardianship and 
custody for mental defectives. Workers with mental defec- 
tives should be familiar with the main outline of this pro- 
gressive measure. The Act provides the legal machinery for 
the mandatory certification, supervision, control, or com- 
mitment of all “idiots,” “imbeciles,” “feeble-minded per- 
sons,” and “moral imbeciles,” who are neglected, aban- 
doned, destitute, cruelly treated, criminal, or inebriate, or 
who are pauper mothers of illegitimate children; and also 
all over seven years of age certified by the local education 
authority as incapable of receiving benefit in the’ special 
schools, or who will be in need of supervision and guardian- 
ship when leaving the special schools at the age of sixteen. 
Those under twenty-one who do not belong to the above 
classes may receive consideration at the instance of parents 
and guardians. All children certified as mentally defective 
by the school authorities must be reported to the local au- 
thorities under the 1913 Act. The following official agencies 
are authorized under the Act to deal with mental defectives: 
(1) Board of Control, the central authority which is 
charged with the general superintendence of the supervision, 
protection, and control of all defectives, the licensing, regu- 
lation, and inspection of institutions and homes established 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
24 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
for their care, and the maintenance of institutions for the 
dangerous defectives, and their supervision. 
(2) Local authorities, consisting of Councils of Counties 
or County Boroughs, who through committees assist and 
supervise defectives in need of care who are not of school 
age (under seven and over sixteen), and who keep a register 
of all defectives in their area. 2 
(8) Poor Law authorities and the Ministry of Health, 
which are required to codperate with the local authorities 
and to care for the pauper defectives who cannot be other- 
wise handled. 
(4) Education authorities, who under the amended Ele- 
mentary Education (Defective and Epileptic Children) Act 
of 1914 are required to establish special classes for mentally 
defective children (ages seven to sixteen) and enforce their 
attendance in day or residential schools. In 1918 the Act 
was amended so as to include physically defective and 
epileptic children. The education authorities must report 
the types of defectives noted above to the local authori- 
ties. 
(5) Voluntary associations, consisting of national and 
local associations, after-care committees, and institutions 
supported by associations or individuals. They discharge a 
great variety of functions. 
(6) Guardianship by private individuals. Defectives can 
be placed under the voluntary or compulsory control of in- 
stitutions or individuals under prescribed safeguards. 
In September, 1921, there were in England two “State 
institutions” for defectives of dangerous or violent pro- 
pensities, sixty-seven certified institutions, one hundred and 
sixteen Poor Law institutions, and about a score each of 
“certified houses” (private homes for the care of defectives 
for private profit) and “approved homes” (in which defec- 
tives are supported partly or wholly by voluntary contribu-
-P-A-G-E-43
  CONSTRUCTIVE WORK 25 
tions). These institutions had accommodations for over 
fifteen thousand defectives. 
America. The first American residential institution es- 
tablished for the feeble-minded was a private school (as were 
the first institutions in France, Germany, and England), 
established by Hervey B. Wilbur at Barre, Massachusetts, 
in July, 1848, now known as Elm Hill School for the Feeble- 
minded. Two months earlier the State of Massachusetts 
had voted the first State appropriation ($2500 annually for 
three years) for an “‘experimental school,” which was opened 
in the Perkins Institute on October 1, 1848, under the direc- 
tion of Samuel G. Howe, and incorporated in 1850 as the 
“Massachusetts School for Idiotic and Feeble-Minded 
Youth” and removed to South Boston. It was perma- 
nently located in Waverley in 1891, and is now known as the 
Massachusetts School for the Feeble-Minded. 
New York was the second State to vote an appropriation 
(July, 1851, $6000 annually for two years), likewise for an 
“experimental school,” located in Albany in October, 1851 
(near the Capitol, as in Massachusetts, so that the legisla- 
tors could keep a watchful eye on a project regarded with 
suspicion), and later removed to Syracuse. 
A private school was established in Germantown, Penn- 
sylvania, in 1852, which received a legislative appropriation 
of $10,000 in 1854, was removed to Philadelphia in 1855, and 
permanently located in Elwyn in 1859, “dedicated forever 
to the shelter, instruction, and improvement of God’s most 
afflicted children.”” The Pennsylvania Training School for 
Feeble-Minded Children, at Elwyn, is now the largest pri- 
vate or semi-private } institution for the feeble-minded in 
this country. 
Ohio opened an institution at Columbus in April, 1857. A

State. 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  26 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
private institution was opened at Lakeville, Connecticut, in 
1858 (or 1857, according to one authority), which was re- 
cently taken over by the State and closed when an institu- 
tion for the feeble-minded and epileptic was established at 
Mansfield. Kentucky established an institution at Frank- 
fort in 1860, and Illinois at Jacksonville in 1865 (relocated at 
Lincoln in 1873). 
States without institutions. At the present time every 
State in the Union except Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, 
Utah, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, and West Virginia 
(and the District of Columbia), maintains a separate resi- 
dential institution for the feeble-minded, but most of the in- 
stitutions also admit epileptics. Institutions have been 
authorized, but not yet established, in the last four States 
named. Montana maintains an institution under one ad- 
ministration with a division for the blind and the deaf and a 
division for the feeble-minded. The two divisions are lo- 
cated on opposite sides of a river. 
New York supports seven institutions (including the in- 
stitution on Randall’s Island supported by New York City, 
a colony for epileptics, and a reformatory for defective 
delinquent boys, but not including the division for “defec- 
tive delinquent” girls at the Bedford Reformatory), Massa- 
chusetts supports four (including an institution for epilep- 
tics), Pennsylvania, six (including the institution at Elwyn, 
a small institution for feeble-minded women, a small colony 
for epileptics, and a building containing feeble-minded in- 
mates at the municipally owned Philadelphia Hospital for 
Mental Diseases).! 
Some of the State institutions have grown to huge propor- 
tions, the largest being those at Columbus, Ohio, with 2726 
inmates (985 being in the farm colony at Orient), at Rome,

New York, with 2640 inmates (including those in the col- 
onies), and at Lincoln, Illinois, with 2021 inmates (including 
those in the colony).! 
Elaborate institutional organization. Some institutions 
have been generously equipped and have developed a highly 
complex network of interrelated departments, divisions, and 
agencies: a custodial department for the low-grade or infirm; - 
a school department for the trainable children; shops, fac- 
tories and farms for training and employment; a medical 
department for examination and treatment; a research de- 
partment for medical, psychological, and educational ex- 
aminations and scientific investigations, including field 
investigations and traveling clinics; a summer school for 
training teachers of subnormals; the establishment of farm 
colony annexes to which older adolescents and adults may 
be sent for profitable employment; and the organization of 
parole service. 
Farm and industrial colonies. Conspicuous among the 
farm colonies are those connected with the institutions at 
Waverley, Vineland, Rome, Columbus, and Lincoln. The 
institution at Rome, New York, began the establishment of 
its colonies for boys in 1906 and for girls in 1914. In 1928 it 
had thirty-two small farm and industrial colonies in different 
sections of the State, nineteen for boys and thirteen for girls. 
In July, 1923, forty per cent of the total number enrolled in 
the institution (2684) were in colonies (702), on parole at 
home (218), or on parole working (172). In 1922, 1400 (690 
boys and 710 girls) passed through the colonies, nearly one 
third of these being paroled or discharged, the number of 
males discharged being 114 and females 61. The total num- 
ber of males and females on parole that year was, respec- 
tively, 399 and 283. Most of those discharged “made good.”

The rent paid for the colonies was less than the interest on 
the money which would have been required to supply equal 
bed space through new construction of cottages in an insti- 
tution. Some of the colonies were almost self-supporting. 
Institutions for epileptics. Besides New York, Massa- 
chusetts, and Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Ohio, 
Kansas, Indiana, Michigan, Iowa, and Texas maintain sep- 
arate colonies or institutions for epileptics. North Caro- 
lina maintains a colony for epileptics at the State Hospital 
at Raleigh. Virginia opened a colony for white epileptics in 
1911, and a separate division at this colony for the white 
feeble-minded in 1914, the colored defectives being cared 
for in the Central State Hospital for the Insane. 
Municipal institutions. Only two American municipal- 
ities have erected residential institutions for the feeble- 
minded, namely, New York and St. Louis. The latter is the 
outgrowth of a protracted agitation conducted by the writer 
from 1914 to 1920, through newspaper articles, reeommen- 
dations made to the Board of Education, to the Central 
Council of Social Agencies (now the Community Council) 
and other welfare agencies, and representations made at two 
public hearings of Committees of the Board of Aldermen. 
Private institutions. Besides the above there are numer- 
ous private institutions and schools for the educational 
training, or the training and custody of feeble-minded or 
defective children in many parts of the country, particu- 
larly in the East. One of these institutions, the Training 
School at Vineland, New Jersey, has attained: world-wide 
renown because of its extensive research activities, its sum- 
mer school for the training of teachers of mental defectives, 
and the singular excellence of the spirit ‘which pervades the 
institution and gives it a distinctive atmosphere. 
Registration in institutions. In January, 1920, there were 
40,519 presumptive “mental defectives” (20,123 males and
-P-A-G-E-47
  CONSTRUCTIVE WORK 29 
20,396 females) in the public and private institutions of the 
United States,! exclusive of almshouses or penal and reform- 
atory institutions, and 14,937 epileptics, exclusive of those 
included among mentally diseased patients. Massachusetts 
provided the most generous institutional accommodations 
for mental defectives, caring for 82.9 cases for every 100,000 
of its inhabitants (in the general population); followed by 
Iowa and New Hampshire, 70.9; Maryland, 66.1; Minne- 
sota, 62.9; and Wisconsin, 61.7. 
Modification of the character of the institutions. The 
American institutions were originally established as schools, 
indeed, as “links in the chain of common schools,” according 
to Samuel G. Howe. Education or training is perhaps still 
the dominant note in most of the institutions, the type of 
training now offered, however, being less intellectual and 
more practical or vocational in character. But the institu- 
tions rapidly underwent modification and became domi- 
nantly custodial in character. They became asylums or 
retreats for the permanent custody and care, not only of 
large numbers of low-grade cases (who were given little 
training except in a few enterprising institutions which dem- 
onstrated that even the lower grades of imbeciles could be 
trained to do crude types of work, such as clearing ground of 
rocks, stumps, and rubbish, carrying timbers and other ma- 
terials for builders, and assisting in the harvesting of crops), 
but also of the higher grades of deficients, particularly those 
who were hard to control or possessed criminalistic procliv- 
ities. The last thirteen years certainly have witnessed a 
marked change in the character of the admissions, due pri- 
marily to the widespread employment of the Binet-Simon 
measuring scale of intelligence, the adoption of very liberal 
standards for the diagnosis of feeble-mindedness by means 
1 Of these, 28,833 were in State institutions especially established for 
their care.  
-P-A-G-E-48
80 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
of this scale, the extension of the concept of feeble-minded- 
ness to include backward grades of subnormals and unstable 
types of fair mentality, and the assumption that these cases, 
referred to as middle- and high-grade morons, constitute 
society’s worst social offenders. That, in consequence, 
many subnormals who are merely backward have unques- 
tionably been admitted is indicated, among other facts, 
first, by the available distributions of the mental levels and 
educational attainments of the inmates in certain institu- 
tions, (discussed in Chapter I of Problems of Subnormality) 
and second, by the adoption of the policy (the inevitable- 
ness of which was predicted a decade ago) inaugurated by 
Charles Bernstein, of the Rome State School in New York, 
and now followed by other institutions, of paroling, with or 
without supervision, but preferably with supervision, high- 
grade cases, and even middle-grade cases, of stable tempera- 
ment. The large majority of such paroled inmates, espe- 
cially those supervised, have “made good” socially and eco- 
nomically, while many have earned good incomes averaging 
from $15 to $25 a week and have proved to be acceptable 
workers in competition with their more nearly normal fel- 
lows. 
Importance of adopting more stringent eligibility stand- 
ards. It would seem to be in the interests of the public weal 
that persons who have sufficient capacity, with or without a 
minimum of supervision, to support themselves should not 
be permitted to become dependent upon the public bounty 
and to congest the institutions while more urgent cases, such 
as those who are incapable of independent existence, who 
are improperly supported or controlled, or who are delin- 
quent or criminalistically inclined, are left at large. Our 
first aim should be to provide for the latter type of defec- 
tives, and to secure laws providing for their mandatory com- 
mitment and retention in colonies or placement under guard-
-P-A-G-E-49

ianship. The vital concern of the State is in the control of 
mental defectives or other types of defectives who threaten 
to become a social menace. It is not primarily concerned 
with mental defectives whose parents are willing and ca- 
pable, financially, morally, and intellectually, of providing 
proper support, protection, control, and training, and the 
public should not be required to assume the burden of sup- 
port of such cases. That is the parents’ privilege and duty. 
2. Pusiic Scuoot Cuasses ror DrErFIcIENTSs 
The second significant line of effort is the establishment of 
special classes in the’ public schools for “feeble-minded,” 
“mentally defective,” “defective,” “delinquent,” “incor- 
rigible,” and “backward” children. It would be quite fu- 
tile to attempt to trace the independent development of 
public school classes for feeble-minded and backward 
children, for, although the first classes instituted were, so 
far as can be judged by the school reports, intended solely 
for mentally defective children, sharp distinctions were 
not, in point of fact, drawn between children who were 
feeble-minded and those who were merely backward. Both 
backward and feeble-minded children were, and still are, 
assigned to the same class (usually as “defectives” or 
“mental defectives”) in many school systems both here 
and abroad. 
Reasons for the establishment of these classes. The im- 
portant factors which have contributed to the organization 
of special public school classes or schools for subnormals 
are: 
(1) Example of institutional work. The successful educa- 
tional work done for the feeble-minded in the residential in- 
stitutions focused attention upon the presence of similar 
children in the public schools, upon the serious administra- 
tive problems which their presence created, and upon the
-P-A-G-E-50
  82 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
desirability of providing training for them in classes apart 
from the normal children. 
(2) Enactment of attendance laws. The widespread en- 
actment. of compulsory school attendance laws (mostly in 
the early nineties in America) forced a large number of such 
children into school who had previously remained at home 
and who, unable to do the work of the regular grades, were 
allowed to vegetate in and overburden the primary grades, 
or were merely passed along from grade to grade irrespec- 
tive of their educational attainments. 
(8) Surveys of “pedagogical retardation.” Surveys of the 
number of overage pupils in the grades, begun in America 
about a quarter of a century ago, showed that a large num- 
ber of pupils are pedagogically retarded. - In this country at 
least a fifth of the grade pupils in the average school system 
are overage from one year to six years, or even more. More- 
over, there are from three to eight times as many overage as 
underage (advanced) pupils. In June, 1920, 23.5 per cent of 
the white pupils in the elementary grades in the St. Louis 
schools (exclusive of those in special classes or schools) were 
retarded from one to eight years, while only 6.5 per cent were 
accelerated from one to four years, based on ages six and 
seven as the standard ages for the first grade. The presence 
in the schools of this army of “pedagogical misfits” has di- 
rected attention to the necessity of effecting educational ad- 
justments to meet their special needs. 
(4) Studies of individual differences. The discovery of the 
existence of pronounced individual differences among school 
children, through the application of the standardized meas- 
urements and tests by the psychological, educational, physi- 
cal, and medical examiners, has reinforced the necessity of 
providing individual attention and differentiated instruction 
for certain classes of deviating pupils. 
Extent of individual differences. In one group of ten-  
-P-A-G-E-51
CONSTRUCTIVE WORK 33 
year-old boys the highest ten-percentile group was 1.2 times 
taller, 3.4 times heavier and stronger, possessed 2.6 times 
more lung capacity, and was capable of performing 7.1 times 
more muscular work than the lowest ten-percentile group. In 
the St. Louis school system in 1920, the average difference in 
the chronological age of the pupils per grade, based on the 
average differences between the youngest and the oldest 
pupils in each of the eight grades, amounted to ten years. 
In intelligence the ablest pupil was 2.6 times as bright as 
the dullest one based on the I.Q.’s from the Binet tests given 
to the pupils in all the elementary grades in an American 
school system. By the Binet scale a typical group of chil- 
dren of the same age in the grades have differed by five years 
or more. In testing a class in the first grade in the Miami 
University practice school, I found that the score of the 
ablest pupil was 18 times as high as the score of the poorest 
pupil in the Pressey Primer Scale, 21 times as high in the 
Myers Mental Measure, 1.5 times as high in the Detroit 
First Grade Intelligence Test, and 1.8 times as high in the 
Stanford-Binet, based on the I.Q.’s. Could they be ac- 
curately measured, we should probably find similar differ- 
ences in children’s emotional, temperamental, instinctive, 
volitional, and character traits. Children vary from states 
of depression or dejection, bordering on hypochondria, to 
states of gayety, exaltation, rapture, and euphoria, border- 
ing on hypomania; from states of excitability, nervous ere- 
thism, furor, or “chorea insaniens,” to states of profound 
apathy, torpor, or stupor; from states of indifference, dis- 
interestedness, or emotional vacuity to well-nigh psycho- 
pathic enthusiasm or hysterical lability of mood; from ex- 
treme inattention or distractibility to profound absorption 
or monoideaism; from pathological reticence to uncontrol- 
lable logorrhea; from lack of modesty to excessive prudery; 
from blasphemy to fanatical religiosity; from fiendish cruelty 
to morbid compassion.

34 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
The existence of these, and similar individual differences, 
has attracted the serious attention of psychologists, sociol- 
ogists, physicians, and educators to the problem of the 
proper nurture and training of unusual children. 
Special classes in Europe 
Germany enjoys the distinction of having established the 
first special classes (“auxiliary” classes or “Hilfschtile”) 
for mental defectives, Halle having established a class, ap- 
parently on part-time, in 1859, and Dresden a full-time class 
in 1867. The tendency in Germany has been to establish 
centralized schools rather than separate classes in the regu- 
lar elementary school buildings (Berlin constituting a strik- 
ing exception), to appoint as teachers the most successful 
among the younger teachers in the lower grades at increased 
remuneration, and to enroll boys and girls in the same classes. 
Mannheim established in 1899 one of the most complete 
systems of school organization in Germany, as a result of 
studies made by A. Sickinger of the individual differences 
found among the school children. The Mannheim organiza- 
tion includes three systems of schools: (1) the regular grades 
for the normal progress pupils; (2) “furthering classes” in 
separate buildings for about ten per cent of the slow pupils 
who are given the same literary curriculum, but in abbrevi- 
ated form; and (8) “auxiliary schools” for the feeble-minded. 
Austria established its first class in Vienna in 1885, Swit- 
zerland in Basel and Berne in 1888 (according to a different 
authority in 1889; Chur is said to have made arrangements 
to “aid” the mentally defective in 1881), Norway in Chris- 
tiania in 1889, England in Leicester (in April) and London 
in 1892, Holland in Rotterdam in 1896, Belgium in Brussels 
in 1897 (although separate classes with an abridged literary 
program had been conducted experimentally earlier), Hun- 
gary in Budapest in 1900, Denmark in Copenhagen in 1900,
-P-A-G-E-53
  CONSTRUCTIVE WORK 35 
Scotland in Glasgow in 1908, and France in Paris in 1909 (or 
1904, according to another statement). The school at Buda- 
pest was established by the State in a “model” auxiliary 
school building with eight classrooms, shower baths, roof and 
yard playgrounds, a continuation school for those leaving 
the regular day school, a library for the pupils and teachers, 
a vacation normal school for training teachers for auxiliary 
class work, a day home caring for children of employed par- 
ents from 7 A.M. to 6 P.M., an “aid society” formed by the 
teachers and receiving a Government subvention for help- 
ing those leaving school, and the “Imperial Physiological 
Laboratory,” with specialists on the nervous system, eyes, 
ears, and bones. 
Progress in England. Little information is at hand re- 
garding the development of special classes in Europe during 
the last decade, but England has advanced to a place of dis- 
tinct leadership among European nations both in respect to 
providing mandatory legislation for the organization of 
special classes for mentally defective children in the public 
schools and in attempting to restrict more sharply the ad- 
mission requirements. The large majority of the American 
States have been woefully outdistanced by England. Eng- 
land, having made the permissive Act of 1899 mandatory in 
1914, now requires education authorities to establish day or 
residential schools for “children who, not being imbecile and 
not merely dull and backward, are by reason of mental and 
physical defect incapable of receiving proper benefit from 
the instruction in the ordinary public elementary schools.” 
That is to say, admissions in England are legally restricted 
to “mentally defective children,” who are defined as fee- 
ble-minded ! persons between the ages of seven and six- 
teen, although it is known that imbeciles and backward 
1 Used in the technical English sense. The 1899 Act marks the first legal 
recognition of this grade of mental defective in England.
-P-A-G-E-54
| 86 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
children are sometimes assigned. The Government allows 
a special grant of money for the maintenance of these classes 
when organized in accordance with the specifications. 
“Model arrangements” have been issued by the Board of 
Education regarding the admission procedure and the organ- 
ization of the classes. Attendance is compulsory, except 
that the parents’ consent must be obtained (and it must 
not be unreasonably withheld) before a child can be trans- 
ferred to a boarding-school. The classes are frequently or- 
ganized in special school centers in a special building adja- 
cent to, but detached from, the regular school building from 
which it is often separated by a high wall. The children are 
brought to school by guides or in conveyances when neces- 
sary. In 1921, there were 16,123 pupils enrolled in 201 spe- 
cial schools in England and Wales. At that time London 
maintained 87 junior school centers for younger mental de- 
fectives, with an enrollment of 8076 pupils, 12 centers for 
older boys with 1300 pupils, 15 centers for older girls with 
884 pupils, one residential training home for 80 high-grade 
girls, mostly above 16 years of age, and evening classes for 
those leaving the day school centers. The educational ac- 
tivities conducted in the best special classes in England have 
won merited approbation. 
Classes for the backward. The need has been recognized 
of “intermediate schools” or “fourth standard schools,” 
for children who, although not mentally defective, cannot 
make the regular grades, who need a preponderance of con- 
crete, objective work, drill, handwork, and practical train- 
ing for life, but there were only about a dozen “educational 
areas” in England and Wales in 1921 which maintained 
“backward classes.” 
Training schools for special-class teachers. Schools for 
the training of teachers for mentally defective children in 
Europe have been maintained in Hungary (at Budapest),
-P-A-G-E-55
  
CONSTRUCTIVE WORK 37 
Switzerland (at Zurich, and at Geneva in the Jean-Jacques 
Rousseau Institute), Italy (in the “Teachers Seminary” at 
Rome), Denmark, England, and possibly elsewhere. A 
number of short-term summer courses have been offered i in 
England. 
After-care service. In the organization of “protective 
bureaus” or “‘after-care committees or associations” for the 
purpose of safeguarding the children from economic and 
moral exploitation after leaving school and aiding them in 
obtaining and holding positions, Europe has forged far ahead 
of America. Such associations have been in existence in 
Austria (Vienna), Hungary (Budapest), Germany, Bel- 
gium, France (Paris has an organization in connection with 
every auxiliary school), England (in many cities), and 
doubtless in other countries. 
Special classes in America 
Apparently the pioneer public school special classes estab- 
lished in the United States ! for mentally unusual children 
‘were intended for disciplinary, incorrigible, and truant boys, 
such classes having been organized in New York City in 
1874, in Cleveland (two classes) in 1879 (or 1875 according 
to one authority), and in Providence in the spring of 1894. 
As an offshoot of the latter “school for special discipline and 
instruction,” which was found to contain “mentally defi-

cient” children, a “school for backward children” was es- 
tablished on November 30, 1896, which aimed to supply the 
“needed care and methods of teaching fitted”’ to “mentally 
deficient children.” This, apparently, was the first public 
school class in America consciously and specifically estab- 
lished for the training of feeble-minded children. It has been 
asserted that Providence was also the first city in the coun- 
try to effect a fairly complex organization of special classes. 
The character of the class started in Springfield, Massachu- 
setts, in 1897, ! cannot be definitely determined from the 
Board’s reports. Nor are the “subnormal elasses”’ started in 
1898, in Chicago, clearly defined, but seem, from the super- 
intendent’s report of 1897, to have been intended for “‘feeble- 
minded” children. The class started in Boston in 1899 was 
clearly intended for the feeble-minded and not for “ehildren 
ordinarily called stupid.” The ungraded classes in New 
York City, started in 1900, were intended, according to the 
superintendent’s report for 1899, for mental defectives ap- 
parently above the “purely imbecile” grade. Classes for 
backward children were, according to report, started the 
same year. ‘The classes organized in Philadelphia in 1901 
were, it is alleged, the outgrowth of classes started somewhat 
earlier for truants and incorrigibles, although this cannot be 
verified from the school reports. Los Angeles added special 
classes in 1902, and thereafter other cities in all parts of the 
country followed in rapid succession. Many cities now 
maintain elaborate organizations of special classes and de- 
partments of tests and measurements, notably New York, 
Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, Bos- 
ton, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, Newark, Seattle, Rochester, 
Oakland, and Providence. 
1 The year has been variously given as 1894, 1897, and 1898. Nearly all 
of the dates used in this book are those reported to the writer in 1913 by 
authorities from the schools concerned.
-P-A-G-E-57
CONSTRUCTIVE WORK 89 
Special-class statistics. No accurate data are available 
concerning the number of, cities maintaining special classes 
or concerning the grades or kinds of subnormals assigned to 
different kinds of special classes. Based on a questionnaire 
investigation instituted by the United States Commissioner 
of Education in March, 1911, it appeared that out of 898 
cities reporting, 99 supported classes “for mentally defec- 
tive” (including classes for epileptics), and 220 had classes 
for “backward children” (including instances in which 
“special teachers are employed to assist slow pupils”). 
Most of the 99 cities were probably included among the 220. 
In the fall of 1913 the writer, before becoming aware of the 
foregoing investigation, addressed a questionnaire to all the 
cities in the country — about 1350 — with a population in 
excess of 4000. Replies were received from 302 cities, in- 
cluding all with a population of 100,000 and over, 53 per cent 
of those with a population of from 25,000 to less than 104,- 
000, and 13.9 per cent of those with a population of less than 
25,000. The replies indicated that 16 per cent of the cities 
of 100,000 or more did not maintain any classes for mentally 
defective ‘or backward children, while only 40 per cent of 
those replying with a population of from 25,000 to 100,000, 
and only 17 per cent of the respondent cities of less than 
25,000 maintained such classes. While sharp or uniform 
distinctions between different orders of classes for different 
kinds or grades of subnormals apparently had not been 
drawn, so far as could be inferred from the replies, 108 cities 
maintained special classes for the lower grade pupils (many 
or most of whom were “mentally defective”), and 111 main- 
tained ungraded classes for “backward children.” Since 
the writer’s figures are based on about one third as many 
answers as were obtained in the inquiry by the Bureau of 
Education, and yet show 68 per cent as many classes, it may 
be inferred that during this brief period there had been an  
-P-A-G-E-58
40 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
appreciable increase in the number of cities supporting 
classes for the mentally defective and backward. 
In the most recent compilation of statistics on public- 
school special classes for subnormals, contained in Bulletin 
59, published in 1923 by the Bureau of Education, the con- 
clusion is reached that there has been a considerable increase 
in the number of cities supporting such classes. This con- 
clusion, however, appears to be based on erroneous facts. 
Thus the statement is made that only 52 cities made special 
provisions for subnormal children in 1913 as against 133 in 
1922. But the earlier investigations cited above show, 
respectively, that 220 and 162 of the respondent cities in 
1911 and 1913 reported special classes, which is over four 
times and over three times, respectively, the number re- 
ported by the Bureau of Education for 1913. That the 
periodic summaries of public-school special classes reported 
by the Bureau of Education are highly inaccurate, is indi- 
cated by the following facts. For years the writer submitted 
to the Bureau reports on the number of schools for individual 
instruction for mental defectives and the number of un- 
graded classes for the borderline and backward in the St. 
Louis public schools, but no notice was ever given the latter, 
although they were more than twice as numerous. In the 
report for 1922, no mention is made of the special and un- 
graded classes in the schools of Dayton, Ohio, although the 
writer submitted data on both types of classes, nor is there 
any mention of the special classes in Akron, Ashtabula, 
Cleveland, Columbus, Youngstown, Hamilton, Middletown, 
Marion, Marietta, Lima, and other cities in Ohio. The 
inaccuracy of these Bureau reports is partly due to the 
difficulty of securing the return of the questionnaires, and 
partly to the failure properly to utilize the data which are 
returned. The situation is unfortunate because none of the 
non-official investigations of special classes made during the
-P-A-G-E-59
CONSTRUCTIVE WORK 41 
last few years are as extensive as the 1911 and 1913 investi- 
gations. Nevertheless, although no adequate, reliable recent 
figures are available, there can be no doubt that many more 
cities now have special classes for subnormals than was the 
case a decade ago. The chief stimulus to the establish- 
ment of classes during this period is traceable to the use of 
the Binet scale, and the enactment in many States of educa- 
tional measures in the interest of mentally handicapped 
pupils. ; 
State legislation. New Jersey in 1911, New York in 1917, 
and Massachusetts in 1920, made it obligatory for boards of 
education to ascertain the number of pupils in the district 
who are three years or more retarded in mental develop- 
ment, to establish special classes when there are ten or more 
such children, to transfer the assigned pupils, and provide 
them with instruction adapted to their needs. The enroll- 
ment is limited to fifteen pupils to the class. State aid is 
granted in New Jersey ($500 a year for each teacher em- 
ployed) and in New York (half of the teacher’s salary up to 
$1000) for the support of such classes under stipulated con- 
ditions. This legislation has resulted in the rapid multipli- 
cation of special classes in these States, but it is inevitable 
that, as the statutes are drawn, both feeble-minded and back- 
ward children will be assigned to the same classes, and many 
mental defectives must wait until they test three years re- 
tarded in intelligence before they can be assigned. Minne- 
sota in 1915 encouraged the organization of special classes 
for children not “less than two years nor more than four 
years below normal mental development” (which excludes 
many educable mental defectives and admits many back- 
ward children) by granting State aid to the amount of $100 
for each child attending the full year. The teachers must 
hold special certificates. Missouri, in 1919, by the enact- 
ment of a bill drawn by the writer, made mandatory the es-  
-P-A-G-E-60
  42 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
tablishment of public school classes for the blind, deaf, and 
feeble-minded when there are ten or more of each type in a 
school district, authorized adjoining districts jointly to sup- 
port classes, and provided State aid for classes when pro- 
perly organized and taught by specially trained teachers. In 
extending the provisions of the law to backward, crippled, 
and speech-defective children in 1921, the bill was, through 
lack of proper watchfulness, made permissive. The State 
aid is $300 for teachers of backward children and $750 
for teachers of the other types. Pennsylvania, since July 22, 
1919, has required boards of directors to “provide and main- 
tain special classes or schools” for pupils who, “because of 
apparent exceptional physical or mental condition, are not 
being properly educated or trained,”’ and who have been 
certified as “fit subjects for special education and training,” 
provided there are ten or more of a given type in a school 
district. Boards may jointly maintain classes, or may sup- 
ply training outside of the school district. The State pays 
one half of the total expenses incurred, provided the classes 
and qualifications of the teachers have been approved by 
the State Board of Education. In Wyoming the State 
Board of Education is required to make special educational 
provisions for various types of handicapped children when 
no adequate provisions have been made in the public schools 
or other public institutions. A special bureau has been es- 
tablished to superintend the work. Connecticut in 1921 re- 
quired boards of education to make enumerations of ‘‘edu- 
cationally exceptional children” over four and under six- 
teen, who, because of “mental or physical handicap,” “‘need 
special educational provisions,” and to establish special 
classes on the petition of parents of ten or more of such chil- 
dren. The same year California enacted a permissive act 
applicable to pupils who would profit from special instruc- 
tion, Washington made compulsory in cities of the first class

and permissive in others, the establishment of special classes 
for children not receiving the instruction required by their 
special needs, the “delinquent, predelinquent, or depend- 
ent” (the parents’ or guardians’ consent being necessary for 
transfer), while Wisconsin authorized State aid for the edu- 
cation of “exceptional persons of school age,” provided the 
teachers possess the necessary qualifications and provided 
the classes have been approved by the State Superintendent 
of Schools. The act is permissive. Louisiana in the Acts of 
1920 and 1922 authorized State aid for the instruction of 
mentally, morally, or physically deficient children whose 
needs cannot be properly met in the regular grades, provided 
the courses of study have been approved by the State Board 
of Education. The parish school boards are authorized to 
enforce attendance in the classes. The Illinois school laws 
of 1921 and 1923 require the enumeration of children who 
are “specially handicapped” from the medical, psycho- 
logical, and social standpoints. Oregon enacted a permissive 
statute in 1923 providing for classes for “educationally 
exceptional” children (including both the bright and the 
dull), and for the enumeration of such children. 
Many States have enacted legislation for the appropriate 
education in the public schools of deaf, blind, and crippled 
children. Ohio has granted exceptionally generous financial 
aid for the support of such classes since 1921. 
Training schools for teachers of subnormals. Many State 
and private institutions have for years offered one or more 
courses on the psychology and education of mentally defi- 
cient and mentally handicapped children in the regular or 
summer sessions, notably the Universities of Pennsylvania, 
New York, Yale, Pittsburgh, Columbia, Chicago, Harvard, 
Stanford, College of the City of New York, Iowa, Minne- 
sota, Missouri, Michigan, Ohio, Washington, California, 
Colorado State Teachers College, the Harris Teachers Col-

Oswego, Potsdam, and Geneseo, and Miami University. 
The Craig Colony School was opened in 1920, and estab- 
lished by legislative action in July, 1922, as a “department 
of extension teacher training” of the Geneseo State Normal 
School. Ohio seems to have been the first State to pass spe- 
cific legislation for the establishment of a department “for 
the training of teachers for subnormal and delinquent chil- 
dren.” The Bureau of Special Education and Psycho-Edu- 
cational Clinic of Miami University was authorized in Feb- 
ruary, 1920. This bureau as now organized has, however, 
extended its primary function of training special-class teach- 
ers to include the making of tests and clinical examinations, 
advising with school authorities regarding the classification 
of deviates, and the organization of special classes, and the 
prosecution of research. Practically all colleges and nor- 
mal schools now offer courses in mental and educational 
tests during the regular or summer sessions. 
State supervision. Several State departments of educa- 
tion have appointed directors or supervisors of the special 
classes for subnormals, including New York, Pennsylvania, 
Wisconsin, Wyoming, Connecticut, and Minnesota. A 
number of State departments have also established divi- 
sions of tests and measurements. 
After-care. After-care service for the feeble-minded on 
leaving the special classes has not been developed in con- 
nection with special classes in America to any extent. A 
few visiting teachers or social workers have been appointed 
by boards of education, notably in Boston, New York, and 
Cleveland, to gather data on ex-special class defectives and 
to aid them in obtaining employment. Various social serv- 
ice organizations, no doubt, render similar service in many 
other cities.

In Canada special public school classes for mental defec-

(Fort William and Hamilton). 
3. Scimntiric Investications oF Mentau INEFFICIENCY 
The third type of significant work prosecuted in the inter- 
est of a better understanding of the mentally inferior child, 
particularly during the last decade or two, is the scientific 
investigation of the problem of mental deficiency, and allied 
problems, from the standpoint of psychology, neuropatho- 
logy, biochemistry, physiology, anatomy, heredity, crimi- 
nology, economics, and statistics. Because of the urgent 
practical necessity of properly differentiating between the 
different degrees of feeble-mindedness, backwardness, and 
mental defect, we must rank as most significant among the 
more recent developments the construction of standardized 
tests and scales for determining the level of intelligence, the 
degree of motor or performance ability, and the degree of 
proficiency attained in the various school branches; the es- 
tablishment of psychological, psychopathic, or psycho- 
educational clinics in universities, public schools, courts, 
institutions for defectives, immigrant stations, and the like; 
and the establishment of bureaus or divisions of tests and 
measurements especially in the universities, public schools, 
and State departments of education. Practically every 
large school system now maintains some such clinic, bureau, 
or department, while standardized psychological and edu- 
cational tests are to-day given to some extent in almost all 
public school systems in America. This whole movement 
can be traced back to the construction of the first individual 
measuring scales of intelligence in 1905 by De Sanctis, and 
Binet and Simon. Since that date many revisions, modifi- 
cations, and extensions of the Binet scale and hundreds of 
so-called group tests of intelligence and educational achieve-

ment have appeared in rapid succession. The widespread 
employment of these tests, which are not subject for dis- 
cussion in this book, whatever their imperfections and vir- 
tues may be, has indubitably done more than anything else 
to promote the organization of special classes and the intro- 
duction of differentiated courses of instruction in the public 
schools.

CHAPTER III 
PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORIES OF FEEBLE-MINDED- 
NESS AND DEFINITIONS OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS 
AND BACKWARDNESS 
Rivau Tueorres or Fersie-MrinpEDNESS 
Ty attempting to formulate a psychological theory of feeble- 
mindedness, we must strive to answer two questions: (I) Do 
the feeble-minded differ from the normal qualitatively or 
quantitatively? Is the difference qualitative or quantita- 
tive? (II) Is feeble-mindedness a simple or complex condi- 
tion? 
I. The qualitative vs. the quantitative theory 
1. The qualitative theory. Binet and Simon,' hold that 
the “defective child”’ differs from the normal in the quality or 
kind of his mental make-up. He is “inferior not in degree, 
but in kind.” He belongs to a different kind or type of be- 
ing. : 
The question of scattering. One of the chief arguments 
which they advance is that the retardation in the mental 
’ defective is not uniform or equal in all directions. “So far 
as certain faculties are concerned, he remains on the level of 
a younger child, but in respect to others, he is on a level with 
normal children of his own age.” This “want of equilib- 
rium” is the “specific characteristic” or the “differentiating 
attribute of the defective child.” E. A. Doll, adopting the 
idea of Binet and Simon, has elevated the lack of equilib- 
rium to the importance of a specifically diagnostic (patho- 
1 Also apparently P. Sollier, who seems to regard idiocy and imbecility 
as distinct conditions or entities.
-P-A-G-E-67
  
THEORIES AND DEFINITIONS 49 
gnomonic) sign of “potential feeble-mindedness.” “In the 
Binet tests the typical normal child has a basal year not 
more than one year below his chronological age and passes 
but a few tests beyond his chronological age. The potential 
feeble-minded, on the other hand, has the basal year more 
than one year below the chronological age,” and “scatters, 
failing in tests one would expect a normal child of that age to 
pass, and succeeding in others not expected.” Many other 
writers have adopted the assumption that the intelligence in 
the feeble-minded (and the psychopathic; e.g., H. H. God- 
dard and Florence Mateer) is more unevenly developed than 
in the normal. 
Scattering not exaggerated among feeble-minded. But 
do the feeble-minded, in point of fact, vary more in different 
mental traits than the normal or backward? Binet and 
Simon, unfortunately, did not produce adequate proof 
that they do. They merely described a few imbeciles who 
evinced great irregularity in their mental make-up. The 
wide generalization reached by them and by Doll was not 
based on the analysis of a large number of children of vari- 
ous grades of intelligence. During the last five years the 
writer has made several analyses of “scattering”! in the 
1908, 1911, and Stanford Binet-Simon scales based on an 
aggregate of 2206 records of numerous types of subjects, 
mostly juveniles: normal, backward, borderline, morons, 
imbeciles, epileptic, insane, psychopathic, neurotic, un- 
stable, and delinquent. After reconciling various discrep- 
ancies between the results obtained from the different scales, 
the conclusion reached was “that there is no warrant for the 
assumption that ‘unequal development,’ ‘lack of uniform- 
ity,’ or ‘scattering’ in intelligence is the ‘specific character- 
istic,’ the ‘differentiating attribute,’ the pathognomonic 
sign of feeble-mindedness or potential feeble-mindedness.”

50 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
In fact, it seems to be the very want of irregularity, at least 
so far as general intelligence is concerned, as determined by 
scattering in the Binet scale, which characterizes the lower 
grades of the feeble-minded. The normal pupils scatter 
most and the imbeciles the least. The conclusion here 
reached is in harmony with the findings of S. I. Pressey, who 
has studied irregularity among various types of subjects in 
the Binet scale by different methods, and of Julia Mathews, 
who has studied the problem in a group of delinquents. 
Obviously the prop derived from this particular argument 
cannot be used to bolster up the qualitative theory. 
2. The quantitative theory. According to this theory, 
advocated by Edward Seguin, Francis Galton, J. F. Her- 
bart, E. L. Thorndike, Naomi N. orsworthy eta S. Holling- 
worth, and others, the fundamental difference between the 
normal and the feeble-minded is one of degree, amount, or 
quantity, and not one of kind. We all belong to the same 
genus homo; we all have the same kinds of powers and ca- 
pacities; but the feeble-minded are less richly endowed. 
They possess less judgment, less understanding, less intelli- 
gence, less initiative, less memory, less power of attention. 
The powers which the feeble-minded possess are the same in 
kind as those possessed by the rest of us, but they possess 
them in smaller amounts. The qualitative differences which 
we are wont to predicate are more apparent than real. 
Thus, when we say that the feeble-minded possess rote mem- 
ory but no logical memory, all we mean is that they have 
little logical memory. What logical memory they do possess 
is akin to the logical memory possessed by the normal popu- 
lation. All the apparent qualitative differences in the men- 
tal make-up of the feeble-minded can, then, be resolved ulti- 
mately into quantitative differences. The quantitative dif- 
ferences are more basic than the qualitative. 
~ Meaning of “intelligence age.” ‘The arguments in favor

  THEORIES AND DEFINITIONS 
of this interpretation of feeble-mindedness will be given 
connection with the consideration of the consequences & 
the quantitative theory. But the reader must first be cau- 
tioned against making unwarranted inferences from the 
quantitative rating of defectives. Thus, when we say that 
a child of twelve has a five-year mentality or intelligence 
level, all we mean is that he is approximately on a par with a 
normal five-year-old child as judged by the measuring scale 
employed, being inferior in some tests, and superior in others. 
We do not mean that he has the identical mental constella- 
tion or pattern of the five-year-old, or that his mental pro- 
cesses function exactly as they do in a normal child of five. 
The normal five-year-old would possess more initiative, 
spontaneity, naiveté, infantility, and potentiality for growth 
than the twelve-year-old with a five-year mentality. More- 
over, the instinctive, emotional and psychomotor develop- 
ment of the twelve-year defective would almost always be 
more mature or more highly advanced than in the normal 
five-year-old. He would perhaps be on the plane of the ten- 
or twelve-year-old in instinctive development, and the 
seven- or eight-year-old in motor development. Twelve- 
year-old defectives of the five-year intelligence level are not 
like kindergarten children and should not be trained like 
such pupils. 
Two consequences of the quantitative theory. The truth 
of the quantitative theory seems to be enforced by two in- 
evitable consequences of the theory itself, the correctness of 
which seems to be well established. 
(x) All persons psychologically classifiable along one sur- 
face of distribution. The first corollary of the quantitative 
theory is that all human individuals can be arranged psycho- 
logically in a straight line from poorest to best, just as all 
human individuals can be similarly arranged with respect to 
any physical trait or anthropometric measurement. Thus,   
-P-A-G-E-70
        EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
rranged in the order of height, all adults would occupy 
lative positions between a minimum of fifteen inches (the 
measurement of the shortest adult of which I have record, a 
female dwarf, which is less than the length of the average 
child at birth), and a maximum of nine feet and three and 
one-half inches (a Finnish giant). The line connecting these 
extremes would probably be a straight oblique if a sufficient 
number were measured. 
Psychologically, human individuals can be similarly ar- 
ranged in a straight line, either with respect to a single men- 
tal trait or a combination of traits. Thus the variation 
among adults was from 100 to 200 seconds in the time re- 
quired to draw a line through a designated numerical sym- 
bol (e.g., 0), which occurred out of proper numerical se- 
quence on a blank containing the ten number symbols. In 
the time required to add 48 single columns of- 10 one-place 
digits, 87 adult women varied from 240 to 896 seconds. 
In such a complex trait as “morality,” human individ- 
uals would range from the moral imbecile, or the most im- 
moral being, the vilest wretch, at the lower extreme, to the 
most moral, just, or upright person, the saintliest saint, at 
the other extreme. All other individuals would come be- 
tween these extremes, with the average sinner midway be- 
tween. 
Classification according to intelligence. In general in- 
telligence or general mental capacity — coming to the spe- 
cific application in point of the theory — mankind can be 
arranged on one surface of distribution, the least gifted, the 
profound idiots, occupying the lower extreme, the most 
gifted, brilliant, or precocious, the geniuses, potential gen- 
iuses, or prodigies, coming at the upper extreme, and all 
others distributing themselves between these extremes. 
This surface is divisible into three main groups as indicated 
by the divisions above the horizontal line in the following

Generat ABILITY 
The terms “mentally subnormal’’ or “inefficient,” and 
“supernormal” or “gifted” are used generically, the former 
embracing all degrees of deficiency below normal, and the lat- 
ter all degrees of excess abovenormal. The terms “mentally 
inferior” and “mentally superior” are equivalents of the 
above designations. Different authorities draw the bound- 
ary lines between the minor subdivisions at different points 
and do not employ the same terminology. At present we 
know far more about the subnormal side of the surface than 
the supernormal, not only because subnormals have been 
scientifically studied for a much longer period of time (at 
least since the days of Itard), but because it is easier to dif- 
ferentiate among subnormals than among supernormals. 
The supernormal mind is far more complex, intricate, subtle, 
inscrutable, and probably will defy minute analysis for a 
long time to come. However, most authorities are agreed 
that mankind can be arranged in rank order with respect to 
general mental capacity in conformity with the necessary 
requirement of the quantitative theory.
-P-A-G-E-72
  54 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
(2) Continuous gradation of ability. The second conse- 
quence of the theory is that no sharp or distinct lines of de- 
marcation can be drawn between the different groups or sub- 
divisions of the intelligence classification. That is, there are 
no gaps or sharp divisions between the normal and retarded, 
between the retarded and backward, between the backward 
and borderline, between the borderline and high-grade 
feeble-minded, etc. The different groups shade insensibly 
into one another. They are merely different grades or de- 
grees of the attribute in question. Norsworthy holds that 
even the “idiots” belong to the same human species. To 
constitute a distinct species the P.E. (probable error) would 
have to exceed 5 “from the median for ordinary people.” 
She found the scores in the intelligence tests to be about 
—17 P.E., in the memory tests, —3.5 P.E., and in the ma- 
turity records, —2.7 P.E. In every test some defectives 
equaled the median for ordinary children. On the quali- 
tative theory we should expect to find a distinct gap or line 
of cleavage, at least, between the feeble-minded and the not- 
feeble-minded. But the conceded impossibility of making in- 
fallible diagnoses of the high-grade feeble-minded, or even 
measurably satisfactory differentiations between the high- 
grade feeble-minded and the borderline, proves that no such 
line of demarcation exists in nature. Man differentiates and 
classifies from different points of view, and arranges facts 
into separate and distinct groups and categories, in accord- 
ance with predetermined purposes, in order to further clear- 
ness and consistency in his thinking. But the human race 
which nature has produced constitutes, from lowest to high- 
est, an unbroken continuum. All types of humans represent 
plus or minus variants, deviations of excess or deficiency, of 
the qualities and attributes inherent in all human beings. 
Not only so, the curves of intelligence capacity of the infra- 
humans and the humans overlap. Many quadrupeds and
-P-A-G-E-73
    THEORIES AND DEFINITIONS 55 
infra-human primates are more intelligent and more amen- 
able to training than all grades of idiots and many imbeciles. 
Character of the curve of distribution of traits. In study- 
ing human traits we are not only interested in knowing the 
size of the extreme measures and the fact that all other 
measures are intermediary, but we want to know the fre- 
quency of occurrence of each of the measures. How are the 
measures distributed? Gauss formulated the mathematical 
law according to which the measures may be expected nor- 
mally to distribute themselves. Such a “probability curve,” 
or “normal frequency curve or polygon,” as it is also called, 
is shown in Fig. 5.

Fie. 5. Normat Frequency Curve (after H. O. Rugg) 
Characteristics of the ideal probability curve. This curve 
possesses the following fundamental characteristics: 
« (1) The measures will cluster around one “mode,” —i.e., the 
measure of greatest frequency. The mode indicates the typ- 
ical or central tendency of the determinations. 
(2) Small variations from the central tendency are more fre-
-P-A-G-E-74
” pee aliaiaal oe as ee ei ae ak uk 
56 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
quent than large variations. The decrease is at first slow, 
then rapid, and then slow again, in consequence of which the 
curve appears bell-shaped; hence the designation “bell. 
shaped curve.” | 
(8) The variations are continuous. There are no gaps or sharp | 
division points between the different segments of the curve, 
as already explained. 
(4) The curve is symmetrical — that is, there are as many plus 
variations as minus variations.! 
Factors affecting the curve. These characteristics, how- 
ever, apply only to the ideal curve. In practice the normal 
curve is only approximated. The closeness of the approxi- 
mation may be augmented by increasing the number of 
measurements, by basing results on a chance distribution of 
cases, and possibly by confining the measurements to orig- 
inal traits as against acquired traits. If the determinations 
are based on selected cases, the curve may be “skewed” to- 
ward the one side or the other, or it may contain two modes 
(bimodal) or several modes (multimodal). Moreover, the 
1 Space permits merely a bare reference to other attributes of the curve 
when applied to intellectual ability: (1) The concept of a normal person as 
one who is perfectly symmetrically developed in all attributes is a myth. 
All persons possess “longs” or “shorts” in some degree. (2) The concept 
of a subnormal or a supernormal person as uniformly or symmetrically 
deficient or talented in all directions isa myth. While there are some per- 
sons who deviate more or less uniformly or generically, many are merely 
specifically disabled or gifted. (3) There are temporary forms of subnor- 
mality or supernormality, although most persons probably continue to oc- 
cupy their relative rank positions. (4) Both subnormality and supernor- 
mality sometimes rest upon a neuropathic or pathological background. Of 
seven classes of bright children recognized in a Japanese study, most were 
classed as pathological or morbid. The belief is general that precocious 
children are delicate, puny, sickly, “all brain and no muscles,” and 
doomed to early extinction, decadence, or insanity. Nevertheless, many 
supernormals are perfectly healthy and well-poised. (5) Our concept of 
normality will differ according to race and social condition. It is idle to 
assume that norms for children in New York City would be applicable as 
measures of so-called native intelligence to those in Patagonia. The con- 
cept of “native intelligence” is, to a degree, also mythical. ©

normal curve probably tends to skew toward the minus side, 
owing to the frequent action of the forces which tend to pro-

remembered that the tests were purposely so placed as to 
“cause the median mental age of the unselected children of 
each age group to coincide with the median chronological 
age.” } 
II. Feeble-mindedness as a unit trait vs. a complex 
condition 
Is feeble-mindedness a simple, unitary defect or a com- 
plex condition? According to H. H. Goddard, C. B. Daven- 
1 However, when age standards have been thus derived it rather strains 
the point to argue that the distribution of intelligence according to the 
normal probability curve proves that the scale of tests has been accurately 
standardized.
-P-A-G-E-76
  58 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
port, and others, feeble-mindedness is due to the absence of 
a unit trait or determiner in the germ cells, the presence of 
which constitutes normal intelligence or normal-mindedness. 
Feeble-mindedness behaves like a Mendelian recessive,! 
while normality behaves like a dominant. 
If this theory were correct the diagnosis of feeble-minded- 
ness would be comparatively simple. There would bea sharp 
line of division between feeble-mindedness and normality, 
and it would be merely a question of determining in any 
particular case whether or not the individual possessed the 
“unit trait” or “unit character.” If he did, he would be ad- 
judged normal; if he did not, feeble-minded. As we have 
seen, such a sharp line of demarcation is purely imaginary. 
The distribution of intelligence in both the feeble-minded 
and the normal is continuous. Karl Pearson and G. A. 
Jaederholm found on the basis of Binet tests that “70.5 
per cent of normal children fall into the range of intelligence 
of the so-called mentally defective; and 60.5 per cent of so- 
called mentally defective children have an intelligence com- 
parable with that of some normal children.” The large 
amount of overlapping found here was undoubtedly due to 
the presence of backward children among the feeble-minded 
and dullards among the normals. But that circumstance 
does not invalidate the main argument. 
Complexity of feeble-mindedness. From these and other 
considerations we reach the conclusion that feeble-minded- 
ness, instead of being a simple classificatory (nosological) 
entity due to a constant specific cause with definitely re- 
stricted and invariable symptoms (such as are diphtheria or 
‘typhoid fever), is_a highly-complex condition, complex in 
1 A recessive is a character from one parent which remains undeveloped 
in the progeny when associated with the corresponding dominant from the 
other parent, while a dominant represents a character from one parent, which 
appears in the progeny to the exclusion of the contrasted character from the 
other parent.

respect to the fact that it may affect in unequal degree vari- 
ous functions, physical, intellectual, instinctive, volitional, 
emotional, social, and moral; in that it may cover a wide 
range of defect from profound idiocy to high-grade feeble- 
mindedness; in that it may be caused by a great variety of 
etiological factors, hereditary and acquired, and in that the 
underlying brain defect (pathology) may differ greatly, as 
will be shown in the Appendix. . 
Individual differences among the feeble-minded. Let us 
remember that there are pronounced differences in physique, 
disposition, attitude, emotivity, energy, application, and in 
social and moral traits between feeble-minded children even 
of the same grade of intelligence or degree of impairment, 
just as there are similarly pronounced differences between 
normal children of the same age, maturity, or intelligence 
level. No two idiots are exactly alike: some are apathetic, 
others excitable; some have more of one trait, others more 
of another. The “typical imbecile face” of established tra- 
dition is largely mythical. Some imbecile faces are pleas- 
ant, others repulsive; some are beautiful, others ugly; some 
look intelligent, others vacuous; some are mobile, others im- 
mobile. Few characterizations apply to the whole class of 
the feeble-minded, and fewer still to every feeble-minded in- 
dividual. Between feeble-minded, as between normal in- 
dividuals, diversity, unevenness, and variation are the rule 
and not uniformity, symmetry, and sameness. Hence de- 
scriptions of the feeble-minded must be largely restricted to 
generalizations respecting the average or most frequent 
representatives of the different grades or physical types. 
Owing to the demonstrated existence of “individual differ- 
ences” in the mode of origin (pathogenesis), in the underly- 
ing brain defect (pathology), and in the manifestations 
(symptomatology), there is no simple, single, or infallible 
test of feeble-mindedness such as demanded by the assump- 
tion that it is due to the absence of a unit trait.
-P-A-G-E-78
  60 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
Definitions. In dealing with handicapped children as 
educational or social problems, it is of the utmost importance 
that the children be properly diagnosed and differentiated. 
This work must be done by properly qualified physical, 
psychological, and educational examiners. It is particu- 
larly important to arrive at clear-cut conceptions of what 
constitutes feeble-mindedness (or mental defectiveness, 
which is a synonymous term), mental deficiency, and back- 
wardness or dullness. The Appendix at the end of the book 
contains a brief discussion of the classification of mentally 
defective children from five points of view, while Part II 
contains a vital recommendation regarding the application 
of the term “mental deficiency” to school children. In the 
remainder of this chapter an attempt will be made to differ- 
entiate between feeble-minded and backward children from 
five points of view. Brief definitions from the standpoint of 
instruction are given of other types of handicapped children 
in Chapter V. 
DerinitIon oF FreBie-MInDEDNESS 
The definition of feeble-mindedness will vary according 
to the point of view. The condition can be defined from at 
least five points of view. 
1. Anatomical definition. Anatomically feeble-minded- 
ness represents a condition of serious and permanent nervous 
defect, due to arrested neural development (agenesis), or 
damaged nervous tissue, affecting particularly the brain, 
and especially the external layer of gray cells (the cortex), 
and dating from the prenatal or early postnatal period of the 
child’s development. Herbert Woodrow believes that feeble- 
mindedness cannotbe acquired after the age of five, at which 
time the brain is said to have attained about ninety per cent 
of its final weight. The attempt to reach such a conclusion 
from a consideration of brain weight alone may, however, be
-P-A-G-E-79
THEORIES AND DEFINITIONS 61 
¢ 
fallacious, for it may be precisely the higher functions, cere- 
bral and psychic, which mature after the age of five, say be- 
tween five and nine, which may be most seriously impaired 
in mental defectiveness. Should these functions normally 
attain a stage of development by the age, say of ten, which 
will enable the individual to lead an independent existence, 
then serious brain injuries (lesions) occurring any time dur- 
ing the first nine years might produce mental defectiveness, 
in the technical sense of the term. 
According to this definition, the essential basis of feeble- 
mindedness is the defective morphology of the nerve cells of 
the brain (cerebral neurones). But the condition may be 
associated with various accessory and inconstant defects 
and diseases. The feeble-minded as a class are somewhat 
underdeveloped in strength, muscular tonicity, weight, and 
particularly height. It is believed that they are more sus- 
ceptible to contagious diseases and that they suffer more 
frequently from the ordinary physical defects and from 
glandular, cardiac, and circulatory defects. But feeble- 
mindedness itself is not an active illness or disease process, 
except possibly in a few special types, such as progressive 
hydrocephaly, active syphilis, epilepsy, and cretinism. 
2. Educational definition. The condition may be peda- 
gogically characterized as the inability after years of in- 
struction or protracted drill to acquire any considerable or 
useful mastery in the literary subject-matter, especially 
written composition, arithmetic, and reading. : 
Maximum achievement criterion. In.terms of grade 
achievement, the highest grades of children whom we have 
felt justified in diagnosing as feeble-minded cannot do suc- 
cessful all-round work in the literary branches beyond the 
latter part of the second grade or the first part of the third 
grade, as indicated by our investigations by various meth- 
ods of the educational accomplishments of various grades 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  62 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
and types of subnormals in special public school classes, 
very few of whom were over fourteen years of age. This 
would place the feeble-minded on a par with normal children 
of eight or nine. In the special schools of Birmingham, 
England, the ablest pupils at the age of sixteen were “able 
to read and calculate to about the same extent as a normal 
child of eight or nine,” according to Mrs. Hume Pinsent. 
A. F. Tredgold concluded that none of the mental defec- 
tives of twelve years in a London special school reached 
“normal standard IL” in “scholastic acquirements.” Ina 
survey of six hundred London special school children, Cyril 
Burt “found only seven per cent up to and none above the 
level of standard II. This is equivalent to a scholastic age 
of eight.” W.S. Cornell, after examining mental defectives 
in the Philadelphia schools, concluded that “the high-grade 
feeble-minded as a rule stick fast” in “the third school 
grade.” Some mental defectives, however, possess special 
abilities and may reach higher levels in one or more branches. 
Most mental defectives, fortunately, possess considerably 
higher ability in the manual and industrial arts. 
Retardation criterion. How much pedagogical retarda- 
tion is indicative of feeble-mindedness? J. B. Miner sug- 
gests as a “low” estimate five or more years of retardation 
for children twelve years of age or older, which would place 
them in the first or second grade, and as a “maximum” esti- 
mate four or more years of retardation for the children of the 
same ages, which would be equivalent to second- or third- 
grade capacity. : 
Rate of progress criterion. With respect to the rate of 
progress in school, F. C. Shrubsall estimates that the “true 
defective” advances at less than half, and the “‘ merely back- 
ward”’ at more than half of the normal rate. Of course, the 
rate of improvement varies enormously with the degree of 
the deficiency. With possibly one or two exceptions, we
-P-A-G-E-81
  THEORIES AND DEFINITIONS 63 
have never known imbeciles who could do satisfactory all- 
round first-grade work after six or seven years of schooling. 
The ablest imbeciles made less than fifteen per cent of pro- 
gress. On the other hand, the highest grade of the mental 
defectives progressed only about one third as rapidly as the 
normal children. They required about three years to do 
one year of work in the literary curriculum. « 
Value of the pedagogical definition. ‘The pedagogical 
criteria suggested above for the diagnosis of féeble-minded- 
ness are far from infallible, nor are they even reasonably re- 
liable, owing to the fact that a child’s rate of progress and 
possible attainments in school depend on many factors other 
than inherent ability, as explained in the discussion of the 
educational classification in the Appendix. 
3. Psychological definition. Psychologically feeble-mind- 
edness represents a condition of mental non-development 
(agenesis), arrest, deficiency, or deterioration which is very 
grave and permanent, which dates from early life, and 
which always affects the intelligence, judgment, or under- 
standing, and which may affect, and usually does affect to 
some extent, the emotional, instinctive, motor, volitional, 
and moral traits of the individual. The intelligence defect 
is a basic and constant feature: without a radical defect in 
the sphere of intelligence the child could not be considered 
feeble-minded no matter how ignorant or illiterate he might 
be, or abnormal in his emotional, instinctive, volitional, 
psycho-motor, or moral reactions. ; 
There are three distinct psychological criteria of feeble- 
mindedness predicated in this definition: 
(1) Early onset. The defect must date from the child’s 
intrauterine or early postnatal life. It must have occurred 
prior to the maturation of the mental functions, how long 
prior has not been determined. Some hold that the arrest 
or defect must have taken place during the first four or five
-P-A-G-E-82
  64 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
years of life, but our knowledge is too imperfect to permit 
a categorical pronouncement on this point. Nevertheless, 
in the accepted narrow, technical connotation of the term, 
feeble-mindedness means amentia — non-development of 
mind — as distinct from dementia — loss or decay of mind. 
The feeble-minded have never had more mind before, unless 
dementia has been superposed upon a background of amen- 
tia. They have never had normal potentials, unless, indeed, 
cerebral degeneration of an originally sound brain began in 
early life, in which case the child would still be regarded as 
an ament and not a dement. The dements, on the other 
hand, may have had normal potentials, and may have 
reached normal mental maturity — the brain cells may have 
been sound originally — but they have degenerated. Many 
dements deteriorate to the level of aments, and may possess 
about the same ability as an ament of the same intelligence 
level. Nevertheless, a dement should not be confounded 
with an ament. There is ordinarily a distinct difference be- 
tween a dement and an ament even when the intelligence 
level is the same. The ament is usually good-natured, care- 
free, and confiding. The dement tends to be sullen and 
heavy. He loses his capability to feel, while the ament’s ca- 
pability to feel or to react to his feelings is not lost, although 
it may be temporarily diminished, exalted, or modified (J. S. 
Bolton). It has been affirmed that dements are very irreg- 
ular or uneven in their mental make-up. We have found 
that paretic and senile dements and especially epileptics 
tend to scatter considerably over the Binet-Simon scale of 
tests. The Presseys found that the total irregularity for the 
twenty tests in the Yerkes-Bridges point scale, based on the 
scores for normal children of the same intelligence age, was 
twenty points for dementia preecox cases who were in the 
early stages of the disease, twenty-two points for deterior- 
ated chronic alcoholics, as compared with seventeen points
-P-A-G-E-83
    
THEORIES AND DEFINITIONS 65 
for feeble-minded cases of the same intelligence ages. Based 
on five more highly differential tests (definitions of concrete 
and abstract words, absurdities, and disarranged sentences), 
the corresponding differences were 6.9, 8.2, and 4.7. J. N. 
Curtis, also F. L. Wells and C. M. Kelley, found that the 
scatter was slightly greater for paretics (whose insanity is 
due to syphilis) than for preecox cases, and slightly greater 
for the preecox than for the manic depressive cases, not all of 
whom, however, were deteriorated. Wrinkles frequently 
tend to furrow the brow of the dement, while the forehead 
of the ament may remain smooth until a late age, especially 
if he is of low intelligence. 
(2) Irremediability. The mental defect must be incurable. 
A diagnosis of feeble-mindedness involves a prognosis of 
incurability. The restoration of a deficient to normality 
demonstrates that he was not mentally defective, but only 
temporarily retarded. There may be certain exceptions to 
this broad statement. If thyroid extract is administered 
early enough it may be possible to raisé some cretins to 
mental normality whom we should be obliged to consider 
genuinely mentally defective before treatment and who 
would have continued as such without treatment. It may 
also be possible to restore active syphilitics, and epileptics 
whose mental impairment is due to the seizures. However, 
the writer has never known a feeble-minded child who was 
indubitably restored to complete normality, although many 
have been considerably improved. 
But there are many grades of mental deficiency which are 
not remediable, although they do not constitute feeble- 
mindedness. Hence a third qualification must be added. 
(3) Gravity of deficiency. The intelligence deficiency must 
be very serious. Exactly how serious must the defect be to 
constitute feeble-mindedness? A number of attempts have 
been made during the last thirteen years to formulate ar-
-P-A-G-E-84
  66 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
bitrary standards of intelligence deficiency by which to de- 
termine whether or not a person is feeble-minded, Four 
types of standards have been suggested: 
(a) Absolute amount of retardation in years. Goddard, in 
1910, proposed to call a child feeble-minded if “more than 
two years backward” by the 1908 Binet scale when “under 
nine years of age,” and if “more than three years backward” 
when “above nine,” subsequently modifying the standard 
so as to provide that a child who is four years or more back- 
ward in intelligence is “without doubt feeble-minded.” 
E. A. Doll modified the formula slightly: “Feeble-minded- 
ness is defined psychologically as intellectual retardation of 
two years at an age below nine or three years at an age 
above nine.” No experimental evidence had been offered in 
proof of the correctness of these standards, but they hark 
back to a tentative basis for the preliminary selection of can- 
didates for special classes suggested by Binet and Simon: 
“A retardation of three years indicates a child who should be 
regarded a suspect.” ‘‘According to a convention accepted 
in Belgium, which we modify slightly, the retardation which 
determines a child as a defective is two years when the child 
is under nine, and three years when he is past his ninth birth- 
day.” Binet and Simon, however, took pains to point out 
that “these distinctions are pedagogical.” 
Criticism. Countless diagnoses of feeble-mindedness were 
made on the basis of these standards for years, but they have 
been largely abandoned, because they included many chil- 
dren in the feeble-minded category who could not be so 
diagnosed on the basis of the more decisive social criterion, 
and because the significance of a year of “intelligence re- 
tardation” varies with the etiological background and the 
complications accompanying each case and with the chrono- 
logical age of the child. To overcome the latter defect a 
relative or fractional standard was suggested as early as
-P-A-G-E-85
  THEORIES. AND DEFINITIONS 67 
1910, which William Stern subsequently popularized under 
the designation “Intelligence Quotient” (I.Q.). 
(b) The Intelligence Quotient, Intelligence Ratio or Mental 
Ratio. The I.Q. is obtained by dividing the chronological 
age into the intelligence age as determined by the Binet- 
Simon or any other “test of intelligence,” whether individual 
or group, or whether verbal, linguistic, mechanical, psycho- 
motor, or social. An eight-year-old child with a test age of 
six has an LQ. of 75, which indicates that he possesses 
seventy-five per cent of normal intelligence as determined by 
the test scale. The diagnosis of degree of mental inferiority 
by means of the I.Q. is very widespread at present. Stern, 
merely computing the quotients for a group of auxiliary- 
school pupils in Germany, tested and classified by some one 
else, suggested these diagnostic criteria: the “not abnormal,” 
81 to 90; morons, 71 to 80, and imbeciles, 61 to 70. Morons, 
according to Stern, possess a “three-quarters intelligence,” 
and imbeciles a “scant ‘two-thirds intelligence.’” L. M. 
Terman arbitrarily adopted a range of 10, 20, or 30 1.Q.’s 
for each category, and proposed the following I.Q. stand- 
ards of diagnosis, based on the Stanford-Binet scale (but not 
derived from the actual clinical diagnosis of the children 
examined): 
Above 140, “near” genius or genius. 
120-140, very superior intelligence. 
110-120, superior intelligence. 
90-110, normal or average intelligence. 
80- 90, dullness, rarely classifiable as feeble-mindedness. 
70- 80, borderline deficiency, sometimes classifiable as dull- 
ness, often as feeble-mindedness. 
Below 70, definite feeble-mindedness. 
20 or 25-50, imbeciles. 
Below 20 or 25, idiots. 
Cyril Burt “has provisionally fixed” “the line of demar- 
cation” “between normals and defectives” at an I.Q. of 70
-P-A-G-E-86
  68 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
“for children.” For adults he apparently draws the line at 
50. Below 50, he says, the case is an “institutional” one, 
and between 50 and 60 a “supervision” case. 
The writer found the following I.Q. values for 411 consec- 
utive children to whom the Stanford-Binet was given, whose 
diagnoses were based on all the facts gathered in the case

          Criticism. The I.Q. constitutes one item of considerable 
value in mental diagnosis, but it is subject to various limi- 
tations which cannot be considered here. They have al- 
ready been discussed by the writer elsewhere. The attempt 
has been made all too frequently to diagnose mental capac- 
ity purely on the basis of the I.Q. and feeble-mindedness on 
the basis of an arbitrary and rigid 1.Q. intelligence limen (for
-P-A-G-E-87
THEORIES AND DEFINITIONS 69 
example, a limen of 70). It is a mistake to attach undue 
significance to the I.Q. and to insist that it remains perfectly 
constant throughout the period of growth in practically all 
cases. 
(c) Maximum mental age level, or upper threshold of feeble- 
mindedness. Goddard, in 1910, suggested that the highest 
grades of the feeble-minded reach an intelligence level of be- 
tween twelve and thirteen by the 1908 scale. Diagnoses of 
mental deficiency among adults or older adolescents were for 
years almost universally based on this standard, to which, 
apparently, a few examiners still adhere, particularly exam- 
iners of delinquents. After attempting to follow this stand- 
ard for a couple of years, the writer was led to reject it com- 
pletely in 1912, and to draw the line between nine and ten. 
In a scrutiny of the literature he later found that this stand- 
ard practically coincided with Binet’s and Simon’s. Ac- 
cording to Stern, Binet held that the “moron” “does not 
progress” beyond the mental age of nine. Simon in 1915 
wrote: “Provisionally it might be proposed to fix at nine 
years the upper level of mental debility.” More recently 
Burt has proposed the “mental age of eight” as the line of 
demarcation between adult “normals and defectives,” but 
he apparently considers this equivalent to “eight and a half 
or nine, according to earlier allocations” of the tests. 
Evidence from army examinations. The intelligence exam- 
ination of a million and three quarters of draftees in the late 
United States Army has thoroughly discredited the twelve- 
year standard of feeble-mindedness. The army results 
showed that the average intelligence age of the American 
soldiers, based on the transmutation of the Alpha scores into 
Stanford-Binet ages, was between thirteen and fourteen for 
the white men and about ten for the colored. Of the white 
draft, 47 per cent had an intelligence age of twelve and less, 
30 per cent of eleven and less, 18 per cent of ten and less, 10
-P-A-G-E-88
  70 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
per cent of nine and less, and 5 per cent'of eight and less. The 
corresponding figures for the colored soldiers were 89, 79, 64, 
48, and 32 per cent. These figures bear out the conclusion 
reached independently of the army results and long before 
they were available, that the possession of a ten-year men- 
tality almost constitutes proof positive that the individual 
is not feeble-minded (not a moron, although a dullard), how- 
ever abnormal or anomalous he may be in other respects. 
In fact, it is now admitted that there are persons who do not 
reach a ten-year level by the verbal or linguistic intelligence 
tests (but who frequently reach a higher level in the “‘per- 
formance tests”) who could not be diagnosed as feeble- 
minded from the social and industrial points of view. 
(d) Percentage definition. It has been proposed to con- 
sider as feeble-minded a certain arbitrary proportion of those 
in the general population who rate the lowest in intelligence. 
R. Pintner and D. G. Patterson tentatively suggest 3 per 
cent, and the Presseys 2 or 3 per cent, as such a limiting fig- 
ure, while J. B. Miner suggests one half of one per cent which, 
while more conservative, is still considerably higher than the 
ratio of 1 in 500 suggested in America several decades ago 
before the intelligence measurement scales came into vogue. 
In America the proportion among public school children has 
usually been placed at from 2 to 4 per cent. Burt includes 
the lowest 1.5 per cent of “the school population of the same 
age” in the London schools (who have a mental ratio of 
69.4 and less), but this estimate is admittedly based purely 
on the circumstance that the London special schools at the 
time of the estimate provided accommodations for 1.5 per 
cent of the pupils in the schools within the eligible ages. 
After seven years of clinical study and administrative plan- 
ning and supervision of special classes in the St. Louis public 
schools, the writer arrived at a more conservative estimate, 
namely, about one half of one per cent of the pupils enrolled
-P-A-G-E-89
  THEORIES AND DEFINITIONS 71 
in the elementary grades. The ratio would, no doubt, have 
been slightly increased had the public schools enrolled all the 
mentally defective children in the city. Some were retained 
at home, some were excluded because of low mentality, while 
others were in the parochial schools. The proportion may be 
greater in other cities. It will be possible, as tests are per- 
fected, to determine the percentage of pupils who are below 
a certain intelligence level in any school system, or the pro- 
portion in need of special instructional aid, but the number 
who are feeble-minded cannot be accurately determined by 
such expeditious or offhand methods. 
4.,Socio-industrial definition. From the social and indus: 
trial point of view a feeble-minded person is, in general, one 
who is socially inadequate or industrially incompetent or 
dependent. He does not fit into the social mzlieu, he is un- 
able to meet the social demands, to conform to the conven- 
tions, customs, practices, laws, and moralities of the com- 
munity. He is incapable of subsisting by his own unaided 
efforts, or of independently directing or managing his social 
and economic obligations. The definition as thus drawn, 
however, is too inclusive. A differential diagnosis is needed, 
because there are many reasons why people become social 
parasites. There are many types of social and industrial 
ne’er-do-wells. Certainly not all social or industrial inade- 
quates are feeble-minded. 
Types of social inadequates. 
(a) Some are criminalistically inclined, although of good or fair 
mental capacity. They may be impulsive, emotionally un- 
stable, excitable, weak, indolent, hyper-suggestible, vi- 
ciously inclined, depraved, lacking in moral stamina or eth- 
ical ideals, and the like. 
(b) Some are psychopathic or outspokenly psychotic. They 
may possess good mental capacity and adequate insight 
and comprehension of moral situations, but they are so 
emotionally, temperamentally, or volitionally unstable as
-P-A-G-E-90
  72 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
to be incapable cf inhibiting their impulses and of control- 
ling their conduct. Or they may be incapable of exercising 
such control because of mental derangement. 
(c) Some may be physically incapacitated — paralyzed, blind, 
... deaf — and therefore unable to maintain themselves without 
external support. 
(d) Some may be immature. A five-year-old child cannot sup- 
port himself although mentally normal or precocious. 
(e) Some may have demented to a state of dependency, having 
lost the capacities which they once possessed. 
None of these types of socio-industrial disability would be 
due to mental deficiency, and must be excluded in the differ- 
ential diagnosis. Only when the social inadequacy or in- 
dustrial inefficiency is due to defect of intelligence from 
birth or from early life, should it be referred to as feeble- 
mindedness. 
British statutory definitions. It was from the point of view 
of the basic social conception that the attempt was first 
made, by the Royal College of Physicians of London and the 
British Royal Commission on the Feeble-minded, to differ- 
entiate more sharply the different grades of the feeble- 
minded. The distinctions proposed by these bodies consti- 
tute the groundwork of the statutory definition of the differ- 
ent grades of the feeble-minded in England. According to 
the revised statement contained in the 1913 Mental Defi- 
ciency Act, which, in the main, marks an improvement on 
the earlier definitions, the different grades are defined as 
follows: 
Idiots are “‘persons so deeply defective in mind from birth, or 
from an early age, as to be unable to guard themselves against 
common physical dangers.” The criterion of idiocy is lack of 
the power of self-preservation. In other words, idiots, who do 
not develop beyond a mentality of two years in Binet’s intelli- 
gence classification, are so gravely defective that they cannot guard 
themselves against ordinary dangers, and are wholly dependent 
economically.

THEORIES AND DEFINITIONS 73 
Imbeciles are “persons in whose case there exists from birth or 
from an early age mental defectiveness not amounting to idiocy, 
yet so pronounced that they are incapable of managing them- 
selves or their affairs, or, in the case of children, of being taught 
to do so” — even, we would add, under favorable circumstances. 
The imbeciles, who at maturity have a mentality of from three to 
seven years, as proposed by Binet, are capable of guarding them- 
selves against “common physical dangers,” according to the 
earlier definition, and are not wholly dependent. They can con- 
tribute a little toward their own support, but cannot support them- 
selves even under favorable circumstances. 
Morons,' who vary in intelligence age from seven (or, better 
still, six) to about nine, according to the conclusion reached on 
page 69, are “persons in whose case there exists from birth or 
from an early age mental defectiveness not amounting to imbecility, 
yet so pronounced that they require care, supervision, and control 
for their own protection or for the protection of others, or, in the 
case of children, that they, by reason of such defectiveness, ap- 
pear to be permanently incapable of receiving proper benefit 
from the instruction in ordinary schools.” 
Criticism of traditional definition. The definition of feeble- 
mindedness as applied to children is faulty, as there are 
many children of borderline and backward grades of intelli- 
gence who cannot “receive proper benefit” from the regular 
grade instruction, but who cannot be classed as feeble- 
minded. The rest of the definition constitutes a marked im- 
provement on the old form which is still widely followed, 
according to which a feeble-minded person is “one who is 
capable of earning a living under favorable circumstances, 
1 The word feeble-minded is used in the Mental Deficiency Act. The 
high-grade feeble-minded in England are calied ““ieeble-minded”’ not only 
in the act, but in practically all of the scientific dissertations. This grade 
probably corresponds to morons in the restricted sense in which the word is 
employed in this book. Feeble-mindedness or mental deficiency in the 
United States applies to all grades of the feeble-minded, namely the idiots, 
imbeciles and morons. In England “mentally defective children” is the 
legal term applied to high-grade feeble-minded children (morons) under 
sixteen years of age who come under the special education act of 1899 (de- 
fective and epileptic children).

but is incapable, from mental defect existing from birth, or 
from an early age, (a) of competing on equal terms with his 
normal fellows; or (b) of managing himself and his affairs 
with ordinary prudence.” There are two fatal defects in 
this definition. First, there is a multitude of persons who 
cannot compete “on equal terms with their normal fellows,” 
who are not feeble-minded but merely backward. Second, 
the concept of “ordinary prudence” is unscientific and im- 
practicably vague. There are many persons who, in the 
judgment of others, cannot manage their affairs with ordi- 
nary prudence who certainly are not sufficiently deficient 
to be classed as feeble-minded, but, who, in fact, may be 
quite intelligent. This definition emasculates the concept 
of feeble-mindedness, as it would be possible to class almost 
all kinds of social ne’er-do-wells as feeble-minded, as has, 
indeed, been done during the last thirteen years. 
Essential criterion of feeble-mindedness. Waving all this 
aside, it cannot be too strongly emphasized that the car- 
dinal ingredient in the concept of feeble-mindedness, as the 
word should be employed, is socio-industrial incompetency 
and dependency. No doubt many high-grade feeble- 
minded of the stable type possess sufficient capacity, stabil- 
ity, and dependability to get along in society and to main- 
tain themselves if given a minimum amount of friendly 
supervision and control. But we agree with Tredgold that 
the term “feeble-mindedness” or “mental deficiency” 
“should be restricted to those persons who are so lacking in 
general mental capacity, in common sense, that they are in- 
capable of subsisting by their own unaided efforts.... 
There are many individuals who, although scholastically 
dunces, have yet sufficient aptitudes of other kinds and, in 
particular, sufficient common sense, not only to take care of 
their interests, but to achieve a considerable degree of suc- 
cess in a humble walk of life.”

  THEORIES AND DEFINITIONS 15 
5. Eugenic definition. Feeble-mindedness sométimes re- 
presents a condition of racial or biological inaptitude or 
eugenic unfitness. Some of the feeble-minded are produced 
by a cacogenic heredity, and some of them breed true; some 
transmit their strains to posterity; some cannot procreate a 
normal healthy progeny. The dysgenic effects are particu- 
larly evident when two feeble-minded persons mate. Al- 
though the marriage of all feeble-minded persons may not 
prove dysgenic — normal persons have been born of feeble- 
minded parents —the marriage of the feeble-minded should 
be strenuously interdicted, because they make inefficient, 
incompetent, and more or’ less irresponsible parents and 
bread-winners.

There are children who, while not feeble-minded, are gen- 
uinely lacking in all-round mental capacity or ability, vary- 
ing from a level practically indistinguishable from high- 
grade feeble-mindedness to a level almost indistinguishable 
from normality, and who are misfits in the regular grades. 
These children have been indifferently referred to as “‘back- 
ward” or “retarded” children, or “laggards,” “dullards,” 
or “dull normals.” y 
Characteristics in school. Reports which the author has 
received and scrutinized from the teachers of thousands of 
such children indicate that they tend to be listless and inat- 
tentive, rapidly lose interest in the regular school work and 
fatigue easily, or rather grow weary rapidly, obviously be- 
cause of lack of interest in the subject-matter which is fre- 
quently incomprehensible and does not appeal to them. 
They are often prone to attacks of stubbornness, irritability, 
and bad temper, and suffer from a certain degree of moral 
obliquity or obtuseness. Backward children, more fre-

quently than the feeble-minded, are the disciplinary bugbears 
of the teacher, and frequently of the other pupils, especially 
the smaller ones, whom they tease and bully. 
Conduct disorders among backward children. In Karl 
Pearson’s study of intelligent, dull, robust, and delicate 
children among the English professional classes, it was found 
that the intelligent children were far more conscientious and 
far less surly, and usually possessed greater athletic power 
and more robustness than the dull ones, while the delicate 
ones were below the average in intelligence. He concluded 
that there was a close connection between intelligence, mo- 
rality, and physical robustness. As a result of the clinical 
study of delinquent and troublesome children in the St. 
Louis schools, the writer concluded that “it is particularly 
the backward pupil who creates the problems of discipline 
in the schools,” who is “a more aggressive and intelligent 
trouble-maker, and constitutes potentially a greater crim- 
inal menace” than the feeble-minded child. Only 10.8 per 
cent of boys admitted in rotation to a class for truant, 
refractory, or incorrigible boys were diagnosed as feeble- 
minded, compared with 65 per cent who were diagnosed as 
dullards (of borderline and backward grades of intelligence). 
Of 444 children with a record of misconduct, usually of a 
less grave form, 24.3 per cent were diagnosed as feeble- 
minded and 62.4 per cent as borderline and backward, as 
compared with 35.7 per cent feeble-minded, and 53.3 per 
cent borderline and backward for the entire block of 2774 
consecutive cases, most of them reported because of sus- 
pected mental deficiency or inferiority. (See Table 3, in the 
Appendix.) A similar conclusion has recently been reached 
by S. D. Porteus, who made a study of inmates in an in- 
stitution for the feeble-minded. Of 377 classified as feeble- 
minded (all with an I.Q. below 75), 64 per cent were well- 
adjusted, and only 13 per cent had delinquent tendencies. |

         THEORIES AND DEFINITIONS 
Only 6.3 per cent of those with 1.Q.’s below 55 were de- 
linquent. On the other hand, only 33.3 per cent of 87 
dull normals were well-adjusted, while 49.4 per cent 
showed delinquent tendencies. “This shows that it takes a 
certain amount of intelligence to get into serious mischief.” 
Misbehavior and vocational incompetency due to mal- 
adjusted curriculum. Undoubtedly much of the misbe- 
havior of backward children in school is directly attribut- 
able to their lack of interest in, or ability to do the work re- 
quired in the regular curriculum. Frequently, when such 
childyén have been transferred to the proper kind of special 
class, the misbehavior has ceased. It would be easy to cite 
hurdreds of specific instances in point. 
e ordinary school work is maladjusted to the capac- 
itfies, interests, and needs of a large proportion of these chil- 
en. It does not adequately prepare them for the most 
portant responsibility confronting them after leaving 
chool, namely, the making of a living by the skillful em- 
ployment of the powers and capacities which they possess. 
Tt does not afford sufficient training, or the right kind of 
training, for the proper development of these powers. And 
so we frequently find that many of the dullards in school 
incompetents and malefactors, the vagrants, hoboes, pau- 
pers, inebriates, criminals, and prostitutes. Apparently a 
much larger proportion of industrial turnover or economic 
failure. is due to mental or educational incompetency and 
lack of trained skill in craft work than to physical inefficiency 
or weakness. One industrial establishment discharged 80 
per cent of its hired men within four months as “mentally ” 
incompetent. One insurance company which requires a 
passing grade of 75 per cent for its higher positions, found 
that 60 per cent of 1443 applicants failed on the mental 
tests and only 26 per cent of 1125 applicants on the physical later gravitate toward the ranks of the social and industrial .

tests. Undoubtedly a considerakle part of industrial incom- 
petency is due to the attempt of the schools to force all chil- 
dren into a common mould instead of supplying appropriate 
manual and vocational training, especially for those of in- 
ferior endowment. Of 865 inebriate women committed to 
the English inebriate reformatories during a two-year period 
for notorious inebriety, frequently in association with im- 
morality (they are only committed to the Government re- 
formatories after four prior convictions), 64 per cent were 
estimated to be defective in mentality (defective, very de- 
fective, dull, silly, senile, insane), while only 3.9 per cent had 
a superior education, 52 per cent could read only imperfegtly, 
and 13 per cent could neither read nor write. On the ot 
hand, 64 per cent were physically “fit” for doing hard wor 
The lack of proper industrial and vocational training, 
however, is probably responsible for more industrial fail 
than a low intelligence level. 
The intelligence level of 154 “migrating unemployed” 
men, many of whom were tramps or hoboes by profession, 
given the Stanford-Binet by H. E. Knollin, varied fro: 
seven to eighteen years, the median intelligence age an 
1.Q. being, 14.1, and 89, respectively. The lowest 25 
cent were below 12.6 and 79, while the highest 25 per cent. 
were above 15.6 and 98. Five and two tenths per cent tes! 
below ten years, and 8.4 per cent below eleven years, the cor- 
responding figures for G. R. Johnson’s 107 destitute men, 
selected at random from those aided by social service org 
izations, being 5.5 per cent and 12 per cent. The medi 
\ intelligence level for both groups was 14.2, and the I.Q. 89. 
The medians for both groups (14.2 and 89, respectively) ex- 
ceeded the medians for street-car men, salesgirls, and civil 
service applicants, but were considerably lower than t! 
medians for business men and railroad engineers.

nition of the backward than of the feeble-minded child. 
But, although we may not be able to offer a rigidly scientific 
or exact definition, the concept of the backward child is en- 
tirely justified. There are subaverage children who are not 
feeble-minded. Recognizing the necessary ambiguity of 
any attempt at scientific definition under present limita- 
tions of knowledge, we shall merely suggest certain criteria 
from the standpoints considered in defining the feeble- 
minded. 
1. Psychologically. Backward children, psychologically, 
are more or less deficient in all-round mental (intellectual) 
capacity, ranging for grade children from about a year to 
three or four years, depending upon the age of the child. In 
terms of I.Q. Terman places the “borderline” between 70 
and 80 (some of these, however, being considered feeble- 
minded), and the “dull” between 80 and 90. Burt considers 
all below 85 I.Q. as backward, but he apparently regards 
educational attainments chiefly in arriving at a diagnosis. 
In ny diagnostic classification the average years of retarda- 
tion based on the Stanford-Binet in a block of 411 consecu- 
tive examinees was 3.04 years for the borderline and 2.19 
years for the backward, the average chronological age of the 
former being 11.03, and of the latter 11.16. The average 
1.Q. for the borderline was 72 and for the backward 80. But 
the range for each category was very large, as shown in 
Table I. 
Let us again emphasize that the diagnosis cannot be made 
purely on the basis of the I.Q. Consideration must be given 
to the nature of the causative factors, the degree of motiva- 
tion or effort put forth, and the degree of im probability. In 
theory my “retarded” group is restricted to the restorable 
cases, and the backward to the improvable but not com- 
pletely restorable. But this difference does not always ob- 
tain in fact, for some backward cases in the end prove to be
-P-A-G-E-98
  é 
80 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
restorable, while some retarded fail to reach the normal 
standard. However, this is merely conceding that errors of 
diagnosis are not unavoidable. 
There are other children who are merely specifically de- 
ficient — in some form of memory, imagination, attention, 
speed of forming associations, etc. It seems inadvisable to 
classify such children as backward if they are normal except 
for a specific handicap. 
2. Educationally. A child may be specifically or generi- 
cally, and permanently or temporarily (or inherently or 
accidentally) pedagogically backward. Burt classifies as 
backward any child of eleven or above wha is three years be- 
low standard, and any child of ten or less who is two years 
below standard. The A.Q.! (“accomplishment quotient” 
or “achievement quotient”) has been suggested as a device 
for determining whether the child’s educational attainment 
is equal to his mental capacity. The A.Q. is obtained by 
dividing the intelligence age (as determined by some “in- 
telligence test”) into the educational age (obtained from 
translating scores in educational tests into age equivalents). 
Thus an intelligence age of twelve, and an educational age of 
eleven, giving an A.Q. of 92, would show that the child is 
accomplishing eight per cent less than normal for this intel- 
ligence age. An A.Q. of 100 indicates that the pupil has ac- 
complished exactly as much as the average of the pupils of 
his intelligence age, and an A.Q. of 120, twenty per cent 
more than the average pupil of his intelligence age. 
Restricted use of term. We arbitrarily limit the applica- 
tion of the term “pedagogically or educationally backward” 
to the child who is more or less all-round backward through 
inherent lack of ability, and who is in need of full-time in- 
1 In addition to the 1.Q. (see p. 67) and A.Q., the E.Q. (“educational 
quotient’) has been proposed. It is obtained by dividing the chronologi- 
cal age into the educational age. 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  THEORIES AND DEFINITIONS 81 
struction in an ungraded class (but not a special school for 
the feeble-minded). ‘This type of child is unable to make 
normal progress in school (perhaps only from 35 or 40 per 
cent, to 75 or 85 per cent of normal progress) after an ade- 
quate period of legitimate probation: that is, regular at- 
tendance, proper classification, skilled instruction, adequate 
motivation, diligent application, and satisfactory physical 
health. Some of these children possess sufficient pedagogical 
potentials to reach third grade, some can reach fourth grade, 
some fifth grade, while others will advance even higher. 
Differential diagnosis. In this definition we aim to ex- 
clude: (a) children who possess fair or good all-round ability 
or intelligence, but who are specifically deficient in only one 
or two branches (or in the mental traits on which success in 
such branches depends) — for example, reading or arithmetic 
— and who are in need of special aid in their weak branches. 
These children might be assigned to special sections in those 
branches, but do not require full-time assignment to an un- 
graded class. Most children are not equally capable in all 
arts, sciences, and handicrafts; indeed many persons, even 
those conspicuously well-endowed in general, are deficient 
in some type of subject-matter. (b) Children who are edu- 
eationally retarded merely because of unfavorable extrinsic 
factors: lack of a cultural environment, neglect, abuse, ab- 
sence from school, frequent transfers, lack of interest, appli- 
cation, and willingness to learn, and poor teaching. Such 
children may be brought up to grade if given adequate 
skilled instruction in time. If neglected too long, their po- 
tentials will probably remain undeveloped or will stagnate 
or undergo “functional atrophy” so that they will, to all 
intents, be like the child who is genuinely deficient in in- 
herent capacity. 
3. Anatomically. Anatomically there are two distin- 
guishable types of backwardness. the one due to hampering
-P-A-G-E-100

| 82 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
physical defects — such as defective nutrition, obstructed 
breathing, auto-intoxication, diseased caries—and the 
other due to a certain amount of deficiency in the cellular 
tissue of the brain. It is probable that the cerebral neu- 
rones are not so sensitive or so finely organized in the brains 
of most children who are genuinely backward. 
| 4. Socio-industrially. The backward child has sufficient 
| capacity not only to make his way in the world, but to at- 
| tain considerable success in many trades and handicrafts, 
and in many vocations in which he possesses special apti- 
tudes, and will attain such success if given proper vocational 
training in school in correlation with the literary work, pro- 
| vided he is not handicapped by hampering temperamental, 
emotional, volitional, and moral abnormalities. He is po- 
tentially capable of self-maintenance, self-management, 
and self-determination. 
5. Eugenically. There is a type of backwardness which is 
due to cacogenic heredity, and is transmissible just as is 
feeble-mindedness, insanity, epilepsy, or any other heritable 
neuropathic condition. The laws of heredity, whatever they 
are, are the same for all types and grades of human beings. 
Acquired forms of backwardness that are due to various 
kinds of destructive environmental forces are not trans- 
mitted unless the germ plasm has been modified. The latest 
evidence points to the fact that such modification is possible 
by so-called blastophthoric agencies, but this is a moot ques- 
tion which has been examined in Causative Factors of Mental 
Inferiority and the Prevention of Degeneracy, and will again 
be considered in another connection. 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FEEBLE-MINDED AND THE 
BackwarD 
What, then, are the differences between the feeble-minded 
and the backward? (1) From the point of view of the char- 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  THEORIES AND DEFINITIONS 83 
acter of the mental defect, the difference is primarily quanti- 
tative. The feeble-minded possess the same outline of men- 
tal functions, but the functions are less highly developed or 
organized, or they are more seriously impaired or crippled. 
The feeble-minded simply form the fag-end of the curve of 
distribution. (2) From the point of view of curability, gen- 
uine feeble-mindedness is ineradicable (with possibly insig- 
nificant exceptions) and can only be ameliorated or miti- 
gated by appropriate educational and social training and 
hygienic care. In the case of backwardness, the outeome 
depends entirely upon the type of deficiency. If there is 
grave deficiency or imperfection in the cellular organization 
of the brain, the defect probably can never be wholly effaced 
or overcome. There will probably be a gulf between the 
mind of such a backward child and that of a normal child 
which can never be wholly bridged by hygiene, medication, 
or education. And yet, these children can be improved far 
more than the feeble-minded by systematic exercise of the 
sensori-motor and intellectual functions, by literary and 
craft training, and by proper hygienic care. If the backward- 
ness is due to educational and social neglect it can some- 
times be entirely overcome by appropriate instruction and 
training, if given in time. Children who are backward be- 
cause of ill-health, disease, hampering physical defects and 
physical abuses (indulgence in alcohol, tobacco, and other 
injurious practices), may sometimes be restored to complete 
normality by the improvement of the physical condition 
through the application of the proper remedies and correc- 
tive treatment. Some writers, however, believe that the 
orthophrenic (mentally ameliorative) effect of the removal 
of physical defects has been exaggerated (for example, 
H. Woodrow, L. 8. Hollingworth, Margaret C. Rogers). 
Rogers measured the height, weight, dynamometry, speed 
of tapping and the intelligence (I.Q.) of a test group of boys
-P-A-G-E-102
84 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
who had had their adenoids and tonsils removed, and an un- 
operated control group of corresponding intelligence and na- 
sopharyngeal condition. The terminal measurements, given 
about a year after the operations, showed that the relative 
improvement of the operated cases was greater only in 
weight and speed of tapping. Since the increase in the I.Q. 
was not greater for the operated than for the non-operated 
cases, and since the distribution of I.Q.’s was the same for a 
larger group of tonsil cases as for a group of non-tonsil cases, 
she concludes that adenoids and enlarged tonsils do not 
cause mental retardation, although granting, apparently, 
that they may affect the child’s educational efficiency. 
During the course of a calendar year in 1910 and 1911, 
W. G. Ebersole and the writer carried out an experiment, 
under the auspices of the Oral Hygiene Committee of the 
National Dental Association, in which a squad of twenty- 
seven school children suffering from diseased dentures and 
gums, an insanitary oral cavity, and frequently from de- 
fective nutrition, were given appropriate dental treatment, 
including fillings, extractions, treatment of the gums, dem- 
onstrations in brushing the teeth and gums, and instruction 
regarding the sanitation of the oral cavity and insalivation 
and mastication of food. Two demonstration meals were 
arranged to demonstrate correct eating habits. The results 
of the treatment were checked by physical reéxaminations, 
detailed reports by the nurse, teachers, and principal of the 
school, and by the results of five sets of group psychological 
tests arranged in six series, two of which were given before 
treatment was begun, two during its course, and two after 
its termination. The two terminal tests were given almost 
a year after the first two. Many of the children improved 
notably during the year in physical condition, scholarship, 
conduct, and in the performance in the psychological tests. 
“Most of the members of this experimental squad were lag- 
   
-P-A-G-E-103
  THEORIES AND DEFINITIONS 85. 
gards and repeaters, pedagogically retarded from one to four 
years in their school work, but during the experimental year 
only one pupil failed of promotion, while six did thirty-eight 
weeks of work in twenty-four weeks, and one boy finished 
two years of work within the experimental year.’”’ In the 
psychological tests the post-treatment scores were 57 per 
cent higher than the pre-treatment scores. Owing to the 
impossibility of testing a parallel control squad, which the 
writer tried in vain to organize, it cannot be determined 
with exactitude what proportion of the improvement in the 
psychological tests should be ascribed to the factors of famil- 
iarity, practice and increased maturity, and what proportion 
to the improved physical condition and working efficiency of 
the pupils. But there can be little doubt that much of the 
heightened efficiency evidenced was directly due to the oral 
treatment and hygienic regimen carried out during the year. 
H. A. Cotton has more recently emphasized the causal rela- 
tionship between foci of infection (many originating from 
diseased teeth and tonsils) and various mental disorders, and 
the possibility of curing the latter by the removal of the in- 
fection. ‘The removal of fears, “nervous dread,” obsessions, 
superstitions, habit fixations, emotional conflicts or up- 
heavals, and infantile fixations and inhibitions from so-called 
submerged complexes, or from other sources, may enable the 
minds of some backward children to function normally. 
Moreover, it is probable that some children who “natu- 
rally” develop at a retarded rate may eventually “catch 
up” and reach the normal standard.

CHAPTER IV 
DIFFERENTIAL EDUCATION, ITS JUSTIFICATION 
AND PRINCIPLES 
Tue Scientiric PRESUPPOSITION OF THE THEORY OF 
DirFrErRENTIAL Epucation 
Tue theory of differential education, as well as its justifica- 
tion, rests upon two basic orders of demonstrable facts: 
first, the fact that large individual differences exist in the 
original and acquired nature of children and in the rate of the 
growth and development of their various powers and capac- 
ities, as instanced briefly on page 32; and second, the fact 
that children who exhibit certain well-defined kinds and de- 
grees of specific or generic differences require special physi- 
cal and hygienic treatment or educational training, either 
because the ordinary treatment does not eradicate or ade- 
quately ameliorate the handicaps, or because it does not 
furnish sufficient opportunity for the more positive devel- 
opment of the children’s special capacities. There are edu- 
cators of distinction who accept the first of the above pre- 
mises, but not the second. They accept the fact of individual 
differences, but not the educational consequences deduced 
therefrom. They are of opinion that the differences are in 
large measure eradicable, and can be leveled or attenuated 
by a common process of educational treatment. They be- 
lieve that the best interests of a democracy demand that at 
least all the children in the grades (excepting only the most 
extreme deviates) should be required to pursue a course of 
study which is uniform in its cultural and literary ingred- 
ients, and that only thus will it be possible to elevate the 
cultural and intellectual level of the mass of people of the  
-P-A-G-E-110
  92 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
nation — a result devoutly to be desired in a country in 
which the rank and file must be trained to actively codper- 
ate and participate in the processes and functions of govern- 
ment. While there is much to be said in favor of such a 
view, which has been eloquently championed by W. G. Bag- 
ley, most authorities are convinced that the educational 
needs of children whose deviations or abnormalities exceed 
a certain point cannot be adequately met by the methods 
and contents of the regular elementary curriculum, and that 
they cannot receive the amount of attention they require 
from the regular grade teachers. The author has been con- 
strained to accept this view after nearly a decade and a half 
of well-nigh daily observation and clinical examination of, 
and first-hand contact with, a great variety of pathological, 
abnormal, or anomalous children, in clinics and in institu- 
tional and public school systems. 
Reasons ror Trarnina Mentatiy DeEricIENT AND 
Srriousty BackwarpD CHILDREN IN SPECIAL 
anpD UnGrapED CLASSES 
The reasons which have led to the conclusion that at least 
the mentally deficient and the seriously backward should 
receive appropriate instruction in special classes seem 
quite convincing, if not irrefutable. The following are some 
of the more cogent arguments in support of such a conclu- 
sion. 
I. Benefits which accrue to the regular grades and the 
normal pupils from the removal of the subnormals. In the 
regular grades the feeble-minded and subnormal represent, 
as it were, an unassimilable accumulation of human clink- 
ers, ballast, driftwood, or derelicts which seriously retards 
the rate of progress of the entire class and which often con- 
stitutes a positive irritant to the teacher and other pupils. 
Unable to meet the standard requirements and incapable of
-P-A-G-E-111
ce Te eet Nee Ne ee 
DIFFERENTIAL EDUCATION 93 
grasping subject-matter which frequently is quite incompre- 
hensible to their limited powers of understanding, these 
pupils contract habits of inattention, indolence, and diso- 
bedience, and often, in consequence, become unruly or un- 
governable, thus upsetting the discipline of the whole class, 
and setting very bad examples for the other pupils to imi- 
tate. In obstructing the progress of the class, they make it 
difficult for the normal pupils to work at a healthy tension: 
“strength comes from wrestling,” and not from languid, in- 
different exertion. To attempt to provide a uniform course 
of study in the regular grades for children who may vary 
from imbecility to potential genius is like using a plow 
horse as a stimulus horse in training for a race, or like hitch- 
ing a draft horse to a race horse and expecting it to win the 
contest. Many subnormal children will require three or 
four times as much attention as normal children, and even 
then will not receive in the regular grades the type of train- 
ing adapted to their limitations. If the subnormals were 
given all the time they require in the regular grades, the 
normal and bright pupils would have to be neglected. This 
would seem like robbing bright Peter to pay dull Paul. After 
all, may not our highest obligation be to the great mass of 
normal and bright children, who are destined to become the 
leaders or organizers or the great balancing or leveling force 
of society? By removing the “clinkers” and the “drags” 
the regular grades will be thrown open to the normal pro- 
gress pupils, thereby enabling these pupils to advance more 
rapidly, and materially reducing the extent of pedagogical 
retardation. 
This constitutes one of the strongest practical arguments 
in favor of the policy of organizing separate classes for chil- 
dren who cannot possibly keep up with the pace of the reg- 
ular grades, and who serve as a brake on the progress of 
normal children.
-P-A-G-E-112
94 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
The special classes are a decided benefit to the normal 
pupils. 
2. Benefits which directly accrue to the deficients them- 
selves. In the special classes deficient children are relieved 
of the chief sources of their past discouragement and embit- 
terment. They are relieved of the disheartening, cruel, and 
unjust competition with their superior fellows, with whose 
pace they cannot possibly keep up, and from the feeling of 
inferiority which inevitably ensues when the child is suffi- 
ciently intelligent to realize his handicap. It is believed that 
the feeling of inferiority thus engendered may lead to repres- 
sions, conflicts, breakdowns, or compensations. They also 
escape from the taunts, jeers, jokes, and gibes sometimes suf- 
fered at the hands of their normal playfellows because of 
their patent-stupidity in the lessons, the tendency of which 
is to engender an attitude of cynicism, malevolence, and de- 
fiance. In the special class, if the proper esprit de corps has 
been established, they will encounter an atmosphere of 
mutual understanding, helpfulness, and sympathy. What 
are some of the specific values of the special class régime? 
(1) They will receive more aid and encouragement, and 
little scorn or ridicule from comrades who are similarly af- 
flicted. They will be stimulated by the modest successes of 
their likes to put forth their best efforts, instead of being 
discouraged by the brilliant achievements of pupils with 
whom they can never hope to compete, no matter how hard 
they may try. Subnormals are not incapable of making ele- 
mentary logical inductions. I have heard many subnormals 
in the specials remark: “If John has learned to do this, I can 
do it too. I’m going to try.” The old trite saw is quite ap- 
plicable to subnormals also: “Nothing succeeds like suc- 
cess” — provided the success is recognized as attainable. 
(2) In the special class they receive aid and encourage- 
ment from a specially trained and sympathetic teacher who
-P-A-G-E-113
  DIFFERENTIAL EDUCATION 95 
understands their limitations, takes a personal interest in 
each child, makes each one feel that he is an object of solici- 
tude, and who has the time and the patience to minister to 
the peculiar needs of each member of the class. In the reg- 
ular grades the pupils have not always been understood and 
frequently have been neglected, reproved, or punished by 
teachers who, with forty or fifty pupils under their tutelage, 
could not give them needed attention and who may have 
grown rather indifferent, cold, or harsh toward them when 
they have become “unmitigated nuisances,” impeding the 
progress and upsetting the discipline of the class. This de- 
plorable situation, however, is less an indictment of the 
teacher than of the impossible demand not infrequently 
made that the teacher must educate “all the children of 
all the people” in the same class. 
(8) In the properly organized special class, the pupils are 
also relieved of a maladjusted curriculum which they can- 
not master. The fruitless attempt to master the regular 
curriculum has often led to dire consequences. It has de- 
veloped the habit of failure, undermined the pupils’ confi- 
dence in themselves, and perhaps established the conviction 
that they cannot do anything well or worth while and are in- 
evitably doomed to ultimate failure. In the special class 
they are provided with a course of training which appeals to 
them, in which they can achieve a considerable measure of 
success, and which will fit them for some useful pursuit 
after leaving school. 
In point of fact, nearly all subnormal children quickly be- 
gin to respond, both in scholarship and conduct, under the 
helpful, sympathetic atmosphere of the special class regimen, 
and much prefer the special class to the regular grade, pro- 
vided they have not been adversely influenced by parents or 
others who taunt them because they have been assigned to the 
special, or because they want them returned to the grades.
-P-A-G-E-114
  96 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
Therefore, to be forced to remain in the regular grades is 
an injustice to the deficient child himself, if he is obviously 
incapable of receiving proper benefit from the grade instruc- 
tion. 
3. Benefits which accrue to the regular grade teachers. 
The removal of the laggards will relieve the grade teacher of 
her greatest source of worry, discouragement, and nervous 
tension, namely the pupils who hold back, and often dis- 
organize, the class. The mischievous laggard is frequently 
the disciplinary bugaboo of the class, and may cause more 
trouble than all of the other pupils in the room. 
4. Benefits which accrue to society. To provide special 
classes for the serious deficients is an economic measure in 
that it will accelerate the progress of the normal pupils, or 
enable them to pursue an enriched course of study; it will 
avoid repetition of types of instruction which the subnormal 
cannot master; and it will make possible the substitution of 
three or four normal children for every feeble-minded child 
who is transferred without augmenting the teaching load in 
the grades, thereby partially offsetting the larger expense of 
the special class. If allowed to remain in the grades, the 
serious deficients would merely vegetate. I have known 
many who spent six or eight years repeating the work of the 
primary grades, and then did not receive the training they 
needed. It did not give them the best preparation for the 
type of service they were called upon to do after leaving 
school. In a district with 13,466 pupils, 490 had failed four 
times, 266 five times, 162 six times, 67 seven times, and 80 
eight times, as reported by David Mitchell. The expendi- 
ture for repeated instruction amounted to $265,000. The 
transfer of the subnormal child to the special school will 
not avert the necessity for all repetition, but it is certainly 
more profitable to drill him on processes which he can master 
than on subject-matter beyond his ken.
-P-A-G-E-115
  
DIFFERENTIAL EDUCATION 97 
From the point of view of social and vocational returns 
the special classes are an economic investment to society. 
5. Benefits which accrue to the science of education from 
the scientific study and training of deficients. ‘The seques- 
tration of certain children in special classes has proved a 
powerful provocative of the wider scientific study of the 
causes, nature, diagnosis, treatment, training, and care of 
handicapped children, of the organization and administra- 
tion of special classes, and of the preparation needed by spe- 
cial class teachers. As already remarked, it is directly re- 
sponsible for the development and application of standard- 
ized psychological and educational tests. Nearly all the 
benefits from these diverse studies have inured to the good 
of all types of normal and abnormal children. We are now 
studying individual differences among all types of children 
by methods devised in the study of the feeble-minded. The 
pupil material in the schools is now studied somewhat as 
patients are studied in the hospitals. The teaching methods 
devised and extensively used in the classes for the mentally 
defective have found increasing application to the normals; 
for example, the value of expression versus impression, 
motor training, manual training, sloyd, the employment 
of concrete, objective methods of presentation, physical 
training, and the adaptation of the methods, devices, and 
contents of instruction to the needs of the individual pupil. 
All of the above arguments apply, in varying degree, to 
the necessity of establishing other types of special classes, 
such as classes for the blind, the deaf, or the crippled.

EpvucationaL DiIrFERENTIATIONS 
Having thus stressed the necessity of organizing special 
classes for unusual children, we hasten to express the belief 
that children ought not to be differentiated at all for pur-
-P-A-G-E-116
  98 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
poses of instruction unless the differentiation is carried to 
the point where not only the general needs of the children 
will be better met in special classes than is possible in the 
regular grades, but where their peculiar specific needs will 
receive the best developmental and corrective training 
known to modern science. To make the special classes for 
the “‘feeble-minded,” as has often been done, a clearing 
house or a dumping ground, or a catchall for all types of edu- 
cational ne’er-do-wells, may be beneficial in relieving the 
normal grades of a mass of hampering flotsam and jetsam, 
but it may not greatly benefit the children who are trans- 
ferred, in fact it might prove a positive detriment. 
Assigning the non-feeble-minded to classes for the fee- 
ble-minded. It constitutes a grave injustice, educationally 
and socially considered, to compel speech-defective, blind, 
semi-sighted, deaf, hard-of-hearing, word-blind, paralytic, or 
delinquent children who are merely backward and not feeble- 
minded, or pedagogically retarded children of normal men- 
tality, to spend their school days in classes for the feeble- 
minded, as has to our knowledge not infrequently been done. 
The progress of such children in the literary subject-matter 
in the special classes will inevitably be retarded by the slow 
pace of the feeble-minded. If the instruction is suited to the 
needs of the feeble-minded, which will be the inevitable tend- 
ency if the classes contain a preponderance of such pupils, 
it will not suit the needs of the children who possess fair or 
normal intelligence, or whose defects are markedly different. 
Pupils whom the writer has transferred to ungraded classes 
from the special schools, where they would have stagnated 
in the fourth or fifth grades, have completed the grades, and, 
in some cases, entered the high school. 
Assignment of the feeble-minded to backward classes. 
A parallel difficulty ensues when feeble-minded children are 
assigned to classes for the merely backward. If the work
-P-A-G-E-117
  DIFFERENTIAL EDUCATION 99 
is adapted to the needs of the backward, it will not fit the 
feeble-minded. The latter will be given too much literary 
work and not enough manumental. It is evident that if 
pedagogical misfits are indiscriminately assigned to special 
classes, the difficulties which existed in the grades will recur 
except that there will be fewer pupils to the class. Therefore 
I voice the earnest plea that care be taken in classifying 
children for differential instruction to restrict each grouping 
to children who are subject to approximately similar devi- 
ations or defects and who require approximately similar 
training. The differentiations must be much more finely 
drawn than the practice now in vogue in most school systems. 
Principles of educational differentiation. Is it possible to 
formulate principles of educational differentiation to guide 
in the selection of children for different types of special 
classes or for providing special aid, which can be clearly 
stated and which can be applied successfully in practice, and 
which will result in the organization of flexible, adjustable 
systems of special classes and schemes for providing special 
assistance for deficient, retarded, or defective pupils en- 
rolled in the elementary grades? Two basic principles have 
gradually emerged from the author’s practical experience in 
administering systems of special classes for deficient children 
and in examining abnormal types of children from schools 
and institutions. These principles represent conservative, 
defensible formulations, a middle ground between those who 
would abolish nearly all special classes and those who would 
assign one fourth or one fifth of all the elementary pupils to 
special classes or special divisions for subaverage children.! 
1In a book on deficient children it is not to be expected that we should 
enter into a discussion of the educational requirements of superior or super- 
normal children. The writer, whose first-hand experience with this type is 
less extensive, considers that this problem is much more complex and in- 
volved. The educational needs of the deaf have been studied since 1620 and 
of the feeble-minded since about 1800, but the study of the pedagogy of the

  100 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
First basic principle. I shall first state this principle in ac- 
cordance with traditional belief and practice, including my 
own practice in past years, and then note certain exceptions 
or reservations which I deem essential in order to safeguard 
the best interests of the children. 
The principle has won wide acceptance that all children 
who are educable but so defective mentally or physically 
that they are incapable of being trained for self-support, 
self-control, or independent existence under the conditions 
obtaining in the locality in which they reside, should be as- 
_ signed on full time as early as discovered to appropriate spe- 
cial public school classes or schools for types of training which 
will maximally overcome their specific handicaps, or, when 
the handicaps cannot be ameliorated or overcome, which 
will maximally develop not only their special talents, but 
also the morale needed to overcome the personality defects 
from which many suffer. 
Institutional care as a necessary corollary. A comple- 
mentary principle which may be stated in this connection is 
that children who are not properly controlled, protected, and 
supported at home should be placed under guardianship or 
in a residential institution (in which at least the educational 
work is under the supervision of the state department of 
education), either before or after receiving training in the 
special classes of the public schools, and either temporarily 
or permanently, according to the exigencies of each case. 
Waving aside such exceptions, we hold that the primary 
obligation for educating mental defectives devolves upon 
the public schools, not only because the limited accommoda- 
tions now afforded by the residential institutions, and which 
supernormal has scarcely begun. Moreover, it is easier to differentiate and 
grade the restricted mind of the subnormal than the infinitely complex and 
subtle mental mechanism of the brilliant or precocious (certainly by investi- 
gators who may be less brilliant than the pupils).
-P-A-G-E-119
  DIFFERENTIAL EDUCATION 101 
can be afforded for a long time to come, will make it alto- 
gether impossible to admit but a small proportion of men- 
tally defective children, but also because the needed educa- 
tional training can be supplied more economically in the pub- 
lic day classes than in the residential institutions, where the 
children would have to be housed and fed. The State should 
not be required to assume the support of children whom the 
parents are financially able, socially competent, and willing 
torear. To advocate the removal of defective children from 
good, responsible homes which are providing adequate care, 
notwithstanding the parents’ protests, is to indulge in pre-_ 
posterous visions, even when the purpose is laudable. More- 
over, it frequently requires a long time to determine whether 
an alleged mentally defective child is actually defective. 
Objections to the first basic principle as formulated. 
While many school systems, notably the St. Louis schools, 
have for years successfully conducted systems of special 
classes or schools intended exclusively for “mentally de- 
fective” children as the term is usually understood, valid 
objections may be made to the basis of differentiation postu- 
lated in the first principle. It may be urged that it is not the 
function of the public schools to attempt to determine what 
children will or will not prove to be self-supporting, or should 
or should not be committed to institutions, or to differentiate 
the instruction or classify or group the children according as 
they are adjudged to be institutional or non-institutional 
cases. The difficulties of attempting to do this are quite 
insurmountable, as there is considerable lack of agreement 
regarding the exact definition of feeble-mindedness. The 
upper limit for the highest grades has been variously placed 
at a level of from eight to twelve years, or an I.Q. of from 50 
to 80, on the basis of the results of so-called intelligence tests, 
while the ratio of children estimated to be feeble-minded on 
such standards has varied from less than one half of one per   
-P-A-G-E-120
   102 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
cent to about five per cent. Nor is it possible to determine 
whether many of the children will in fact prove to be feeble- 
minded until they have been afforded adequate opportu- 
nities for industrial arts and vocational training in the 
schools and sometimes until they have had a sufficient 
period of probationary trial at various jobs after leaving 
school. On the other hand, it does not require a very long 
period of observation and examination by present methods 
to determine whether or not the child is in need of special 
aid and instruction. The supplying of such instruction 
should not be held in abeyance pending the decision as to 
whether or not the child will prove to be feeble-minded, in 
the social and legal connotation of the term. The business 
of the schools is relatively simple and direct, namely, to dis- 
cover the children who need special instruction, and to clas- 
sify, group, or assign, and to reclassify or reassign the 
children as efficiently as can be done in the light of their 
educational needs as they become apparent from time to 
time. 
The primary concern of the schools is to effect groupings 
which will maximally serve the present needs of the mem- 
bers of the group. This, however, can only be effectively 
done when children are placed in the same group who are 
subject to about the same degree of deficiency or the same 
kind of defect, and who therefore require approximately the 
same kind of training or treatment. The very aim of the 
grouping will be defeated by admitting all grades of retarded 
children into the same class. 
This makes it necessary to draw a line somewhere. As 
already indicated, the practice has been to restrict one type 
of class to “feeble-minded,” “mentally defective,” “defec- 
tive,” “imbecilic” or “moronic” children, who are regarded 
as socially and industrially incompetent and subject to 
legal certification and commitment to an institution for the 
 
-P-A-G-E-121

feeble-minded. It is unfortunate that these words as ap- 
plied to special class children should have acquired these 
implications, and it would be highly desirable to use a sub- 
stitute term. But it is not probable that this will be done 
soon because of the persistence of habit and tradition, and 
because of the abiding interest in “‘feeble-minded,” “men- 
tally defective,” and “defective” children which has been 
aroused by decades of propaganda, advantage of which may 
be taken in conducting “drives” for the establishment of 
special classes for mentally handicapped children and secur- 
ing educational legislation in their behalf. We cannot, un- 
fortunately, escape the necessity of applying some sort of 
designation to the most backward or deficient children se- 
lected for the special classes. But if the term “mentally 
defective” or “feeble-minded” is applied to children as- 
signed to the special schools for the most deficient, care 
should be taken to use the words only in the psychological 
and educational sense. 
In Part II of this book I shall limit the application of the 
term “feeble-minded” or “mentally defective” children to 
the educational and psychological connotations given on 
pages 61-70, and to those qualifying for special classes under 
the standards laid down on page 130. No assumption will, 
therefore, be made that such children are feeble-minded or 
mentally defective in the social sense, although, of course, 
many, perhaps most, of the children assigned to the spe- 
cial classes under the recommendations made in this part 
of the book will, in point of fact, prove to be so. I shall, 
however, give preference to the use of the terms “mental 
deficiency” and “mentally deficient children.” These 
terms are not ordinarily used as equivalents of mental de- 
fectiveness or mentally defective children, although many 
so classified will prove to be feeble-minded. “Mental de- 
ficiency” will be synonymous with “mental defectiveness”
-P-A-G-E-122
  104 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
in the psychological and educational sense. Some of the 
children admitted as mentally deficient to the special 
classes, even under the very conservative admission stand- 
ards recommended in Chapter VI, will, in the end, prove 
not to be socially and industrially feeble-minded. I shall 
use the term “defectives” or “defective children” as a gen- 
eric designation for the physically defective or the mentally 
deficient. 
Second basic principle. The second principle is that the 
less gravely defective or deficient or handicapped children 
who are trainable for independent existence in society, but 
who are incapable, temporarily or permanently, of success- 
fully coping with the requirements of the regular grades, or 
whose special needs cannot be met by the ordinary instruc- 
tion — and this includes the large majority of handicapped 
children — should be assigned on full or part time to special 
classes, groups, divisions, or courses, either for differential, 
corrective training, or for coaching or special aid in the reg- 
ular program of studies. Children so assigned who possess 
the potentials for restoration or rehabilitation should be 
returned to the regular grades as soor as possible, while 
the others should continue in the special classes or receive 
such special aid as may best serve their individual require- 
ments. ‘ 
GerNERAL CONSIDERATIONS TO BE FoLLOWED IN THE Es- 
TABLISHMENT OF Various Kinps oF SPECIAL CLASSES 
In the remainder of this chapter we shall indicate certain 
subsidiary principles or rules which should be followed in the 
organization of all kinds of special classes, and in the follow- 
ing chapters emphasize certain technical requirements and 
facts which should be observed in the establishment, or- 
ganization, and conduct of classes for children who are sub- 
ject to orthopedic, visual, auditory, speech, conduct, and
-P-A-G-E-123

mental defects, especially the mentally deficient and back- 
ward.! 
Admission procedure. No child should be assigned on 
full time to a special class (except as hereinafter noted) 
without being properly certified by a constituted official 
after an adequate examination, the detailed character and 
extent of which will vary with the nature of the case. A 
measurably complete examination, which many will require, 
should include a physical, psychological, and educational 
examination, and a “history of the case”; that is, an inves- 
tigation of the genetic and etiological background of the dis- 
ability, including an inquiry into the family history, the 
child’s developmental history (physical, psychological, so- 
cial, and educational), and the influencing factors from the 
home and neighborhood environments. Group and individ- 
ual tests of verbal intelligence and psycho-motor and per- 
formance ability are of great value, but too much depend- 
ence must not be placed on mere test findings and test 
scores, particularly when based on group tests. Group 
tests are subject to many sources of error which cannot be 
readily controlled. The proper diagnosis of educationally 
deviating children requires the services of experts who know 
how to interpret and apply test results from a rich back- 
ground of technical knowledge and first-hand experience 
with a great variety of types of educationally and mentally 
abnormal children. Such knowledge cannot be secured 
merely by studying tests and test results, and mastering the 
technique of administering tests. If it be thought that this 
requirement is unnecessarily exacting, let it be emphasized 
that the schools cannot permit the child’s future to be jeop- 
ardized through avoidable bungling during the initial pro- 
cedure. Careful preliminary examinations by properly

blind will not be considered.
-P-A-G-E-124
  106 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
qualified authorities will obviate many mistaken assign- 
ments. The practice of requiring examinations preliminary 
to transfer is becoming widespread. To the writer’s inquiry 
in the fall of 1913, all of 103 cities, except two, supporting 
special classes (referring especially to classes for the mentally 
defective), replied that some kind of preliminary examina- 
tion was required prior to assignment. Seventy-nine per 
cent gave medical examinations, fifty-seven per cent educa- 
tional examinations (assumedly in the main the ordinary 
promotion examinations and tests), and eighty-one per cent 
psychological examinations (mainly Binet testing). So far 
as could be gathered from the returns, the examinations at 
that time were rather crude and meager. Of one hundred 
and fifteen examiners, the largest group consisted of special 
class teachers (fifty-eight), eleven were supervisors of spe- 
cial classes or principals, four superintendents, five alienists 
or neurologists, twenty-two medical inspectors, twenty-one 
psychologists or clinical psychologists. Seventy-seven per 
cent of the examiners were educators, and twenty-three per 
cent physicians. Not more than about a fifth could at that 
time qualify as experts on mentally defective and backward 
children. 
Now many school systems maintain elaborate organiza- 
tions for examining and testing the pupils, and do not per- 
mit transfers without certification by the examining agen- 
cies. 
\.Time to begin specialized training. Special training   
   hould be provided just as soon as the child’s condition can 
be determined with reasonable certainty. In the case of the 
‘crippled, the speech defective, and those with visual and 
' auditory handicaps, the special training should begin as 
soon as the child enters school. In fact, it might well begin 
during the pre-kindergarten period. On the other hand, 
mentally subnormal children of uncertain diagnosis should
-P-A-G-E-125
  DIFFERENTIAL EDUCATION 107 
be given adequate preliminary trials in regular or ungraded 
classes before being assigned to classes for the lowest grades 
of deficients. 
Correction or removal of remediable physical impedi- 
ments. Remediable defects, disorders, or diseases should be 
removed or corrected if they interfere with the efficient 
functioning of the psychophysical organism, if they tend to 
hamper the child’s physical, mental, or educational growth 
or development, if they render it difficult for him properly to 
apply himself to his school tasks, and, although apparently 
not injurious at the time, if they lay the foundation for later 
diseases and breakdowns. Important among such defects 
are foci of infection (mostly in the tonsils, diseased dentures 
and gums), obstructions to proper breathing (nasal polypi, 
adenoids, enlarged turbinates, deviated septum), defective 
nutrition, glandular disfunctioning, and defective vision 
and hearing. To provide proper medical, hygienic, and 
physical treatment is often a humane measure for the child 
concerned, and frequently an economic investment for soci- 
ety. The removal of foci of infection and irritating impedi- 
ments and the cure of diseases will enable some children to 
apply themselves better, to use the abilities they possess to 
better advantage, and to achieve greater success in their 
school work. Remedial treatment should be afforded cer- 
tain types pending consideration of the contemplated trans- 
fer (for example, those suffering from impaired vision or 
hearing), while others should secure treatment at the earli- 
est practicable opportunity after the examination. It would 
be impracticable and unnecessary to defer the transfer of 
mental deficients until the effects of the treatment could be 
fully ascertained. Properly to carry out this reeommenda- 
tion may require the establishment of various school medi- 
cal and dental dispensaries for the free treatment of the 
indigent, the provision of school lunches for the malnutri-
-P-A-G-E-126
  108 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
tion cases, and the enactment of legislation to reach the 
children of recalcitrant parents who refuse to heed the re- 
commendations, although it is problematic how far the State 
may go in enforcing treatment. 
Medical or physical treatment is the first. measure of re- 
lief to give defective children. It will prove to be a valuable 
aid in many cases, but it should be regarded as an aid and 
not as a panacea for mental inefficiency. It will not remedy 
all mental and educational disabilities. Its influence will 
sometimes be wholly negative. Moreover, often when the 
physical treatment proves efficacious it must be followed by 
a special educational regimentation. But since the results 
of the medical treatment frequently cannot be foreseen, it 
should be included as an experimental preliminary step in 
our program of educational reconstruction for the mentally 
handicapped, and, of course, the physically maimed, with 
whom the results can be more accurately prognosticated. 
Discharge and retention of pupils. No pupil should be 
discharged from a special class (with exceptions noted here- 
inafter) except upon the action of the responsible official in 
charge. But no pupil should be retained in a special class 
whose condition has been remedied or who has been so im- 
proved that he can successfully cope with the work in the 
regular grades. An effective system of reports or follow-up 
inspection must be instituted in order that all deserving 
children will be given proper consideration. 
Preservation of case records. Records should be kept on 
permanent file in the proper department of all examinations, 
findings, assignments, transfers, treatments, and the results 
of treatments. If possible, an annual report should also be 
filed from the special class indicating the level of attain- 
ment the child has reached in the various branches, his spe- 
cial talents, his moral and mental characteristics, and the 
teachers’ recommendations respecting his future training or
-P-A-G-E-127
    | DIFFERENTIAL EDUCATION 109 
aminees, to file the records according to the serial number, 
but to arrange the index cards of the children’s names al- 
phabetically. The forms used by the author during the last 
decade for the physical examination, the pedagogical, per- 
sonal, and family history,.and the report from the special 
class, may be found in the report of the psycho-educational 
clinic in the Annual Report of the Board of Education of the 
City of St. Louts for 1914-15. A more complete “Schema” 
is available in Chapter XIX of The Mental Health of the 
School. Child. 
Systematic progress records must be kept of each child if 
we are to keep a check on the work done and the results 
achieved in the special schools. Such records, like geolog- 
ical strata, will provide psychic strata of the child’s develop- 
ment. Such records may consist of samples of the work 
which the child has done at given dates in writing, drawing, 
arithmetic, clay, wood, and so on. But this form of record 
is not very practical because of the enormous accumulation 
which would occur in a few years. The institutions fre- 
quently follow the practice of taking photographs of the 
inmates periodically. This form of record, whatever its 
value may be, is not very practical in the public schools. 
The results of standardized psychological and educational 
tests, given periodically, will furnish valuable objective 
measures of progress. But whether or not such tests are 
given, the records should always include a written report of 
the teacher’s estimates of the child’s attainments and capac- 
ities, observations of his peculiarities, and recommenda- 
tions. In some school systems the teachers are required to 
file three or four reports a year. Such frequent reports are 
burdensome and serve no vital purpose that cannot be 
served by an annual report if sufficiently elaborate and 
faithfully filled out. This is particularly true in the case of ch. It is advantageous to assign serial numbers to the ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  110 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
defectives who are only capable of slow development. While 
the writer was director of the St. Louis special schools such 
a report was filled out one month after the admission of the 
child and thereafter at the close of each school year. These 
reports contain a mass of valuable information. 
Qualifications of teachers in all types of special classes. 
Teachers to be certified for service in a special class of any 
kind should possess (a) preliminary fundamental training 
equivalent to a two years’ professional course in a standard 
normal school or college; (b) basic technical training includ- 
ing courses in clinical psychology and psychopathology, on 
subnormal and abnormal children and in the clinical exam- 
ination of exceptional children, including physical, anthro- 
pometric and psychological tests, and the working up of case 
histories through field investigations. In addition thereto 
they should possess (c) specific technical preparation for 
training the particular type of defective which they expect 
to teach, including courses in the necessary sensori-motor, 
industrial arts, specific corrective and remedial training, and 
adequate observation and practice under competent critic 
teachers. Special class teachers should have earned from 12 
to 15 semester hours’ credit in the basic and the specific tech- 
nical courses, but it will scarcely be possible to put this 
standard into immediate effect throughout the country. It 
is desirable, but probably not essential, that the special class 
teacher should first have had several years of teaching ex- 
perience in the grades. Beyond possessing technical skill, 
the special class teacher, if she would achieve maximal suc- 
cess, should be vitally interested in the particular class of 
defectives she has elected to teach, particularly in their 
physical, social, intellectual, and moral rehabilitation and 
fortification for the trials and responsibilities awaiting them 
after they leave school. She must be patient, resourceful, 
adaptable, progressive, and able to disentangle herself from
-P-A-G-E-129
  DIFFERENTIAL EDUCATION 
the routine methods of mass instruction. Nor must she c 
fine her interests to the schoolroom. She should be social 
worker no less than teacher, and keep in touch so far as time 
allows with the child’s vicissitudes after school, and be a 
messenger of light and comfort to the child and to the homes 
which need her sympathetic ministry. 
Methods of instruction. The methods of instruction, 
training, and care must, in large measure, be individual, 
although it is possible, often desirable, and usually necessary 
to instruct in groups children who are subject to the same 
handicaps or the same degree of deficiency. The aim, how- 
ever, should be to adapt the methods and the contents of the 
instruction to the peculiar interests, habits, previous history, 
and especially to the mental, educational, moral, and phys- 
ical handicaps of each pupil, to modify and readapt the in- 
struction from time to time to meet the developing needs of 
the child, and to allow each child to progress as rapidly as 
possible. | 
Organization, equipment, and appointment of classes. 
It is desirable to organize the special classes, especially those 
to which children are sent on full time for protracted re- 
tention, in centers or schools, with two or more classes to a 
center, in order to permit of closer grading or the depart- 
mentalization of the instruction, and in order to secure more 
ample supplies, equipment, and appointments. From the 
economic point of view the advantage of close grouping or 
classification is incontestable. A class containing from fif- 
teen to twenty closely graded defectives can be taught just as 
successfully as a heterogeneous class with from ten to fifteen 
pupils. The larger the enrollment, the greater will be the 
number of pupils who will fit into each group. The classes 
or schools should be located in bright cheery quarters, con- 
taining ample floor and window space, and if possible, sep- 
arate rooms for the industrial arts, domestic science and 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
    
EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
mnasium activities, with ample playground and garden 
space and pleasant surroundings, so that satisfactory con- 
ditions may be provided for the education of those unfor- 
tunates who, through no fault of theirs, are seriously handi- 
capped in the struggle for existence. 
Paramount need of proper educational equipment. It is 
idle to expect proper returns from special work with de- 
fectives unless adequate equipment, appliances, and supplies 
are furnished for the various branches of instruction. It is 
especially necessary to emphasize that there must be ade- 
quate and appropriate equipment for the sensory, motor, 
physical, physiotherapeutic, and industrial arts training for 
all types requiring such training. Lest it may seem super- 
fluous to emphasize this requirement, let me explain that I 
have visited many special classes for mental inferiors that 
had no special equipment whatever. Indeed, some were 
not so well equipped as the regular grades. In some cases 
the teachers explained that they were expected to pursue the 
regular curriculum of studies, and therefore were not allowed 
any extra supplies. It must still be emphasized that men- 
tally deficient and very dull children cannot be properly 
trained without the requisite equipment. The inability to 
procure necessary supplies is frequently due to the expendi- 
ture involved, but by judicious management the expenses 
can be largely limited to the cost of the initial equipment — 
the permanent tools and appliances, which, with proper 
care, will render service for many years. Nearly all the 
money expended for materials and supplies can be recovered 
through the sale of the manufactured articles, instead of giv- 
ing the articles away, as has been demonstrated in classes un- 
der my observation.!_ Moreover, many objects of value can 
be made for the other schools in the system, thus affecting 
1 If necessary many materials can be obtained without cost, such as cigar 
and dry-goods boxes, rags, or discarded remnants from homes and stores.
-P-A-G-E-131
DIFFERENTIAL EDUCATION 113 
counterbalancing economies. This procedure is justified not 
only economically, but educationally. We must so train the 
defective children that they will acquire some appreciation of 
practical values, and form the habit of accomplishing things 
which have a direct utilitarian value both to themselves and 
to society. However, the recommendation here made must 
not be abused. We know of a special school in which the 
teachers and pupils became so enthusiastic about making 
articles for sale that there was danger of transforming the 
class into a miniature factory. The training in the indus- 
trial arts in the special schools is given primarily for the sake 
of the educational training, and not for the purpose of creat- 
ing and supplying a market. If the children are urged to 
keep on making articles when no further training values ac- 
crue from the process of manufacture, the shop becomes a 
factory and not a school.

or open window ventilation.

thirty, of the dull-backward grade from eighteen to twenty-» 
| two, and of the mentally defective from thirteen to sixteen. ) 
\ There is no evidence for the assumption that successful edu- } 
\ cational work for mentally normal cripples requires the lim- | 
\ itation of the register to eight or ten pupils, especially in cen- | 
oe schools where the pupils can be properly graded. 
Transportation. The most economic solution is to ar- 
range for the use of police-patrol automobiles, as is done in 
Chicago, Detroit, Boston, and Baltimore. Such a convey- 
ance is marked “‘school ambulance” in Baltimore. Children 
whose locomotion is not markedly disorganized may be 
brought by older pupils who have been transferred to a 
near-by public school. 
__.Dischaége of pupils. Pupils whose orthopedic disabilities 
have been overcome; or who no longer require further physi- 
otherapeutic treatment, or who would receive no further 
benefit from such treatment, and who are not receiving any 
special form of educational training which cannot be given 
equally well in other types of classes, should be transferred 
to the regular grades or to such other classes or schools (for 
example, ungraded, prevocational, or vocational) as will ade- 
quately meet their cultural and vocational needs. The prac- 
tice of permanently retaining crippled children in classes for 
cripples when nothing further can be done to improve their 
specific physical disabilities, is without justification, if trans- 
portation to other classes can be supplied for those incapable 
of locomotion. Crippled children should be given the op- 
portunity to associate with, and labor among, the children 
with whom they must live and codperate in later life. 
_QeeenMftion. The rooms in the regular schools should 
afford’a Sunny exposure and be located on the first floor. A 
specially constructed building should contain only one story 
if the necessary ground space is available, otherwise two 
stories equipped with stairs and inclines (or an elevator, if
-P-A-G-E-134
  116 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
possible). A model building should contain an assembly 
room, academic classrooms, industrial classrooms, a room 
for curative gymnastics, electric treatment and massage, a 
solarium for heliotherapy, a bathroom, rest rooms (with a 
few wicker or woven-cane couches, or sanitary or army cots, 
wicker rockers, and folding chairs), an open-air room (with 
the necessary cots and blankets), a kitchen, dining-room, 
toilet-rooms, several exits, wide aisles, handrails along the 
walls, rubber or cork covering on the floors and stairs, and 
no thresholds between the rooms. The seats and desks of 
various sizes should be unfastened, adjustable, or semi- 
adjustable, and equipped with book drawers. Among seats 
or desks which will bear investigation may be recommended 
the following: The “A-O” desk chairs with righ! left-arm 
support, or the Elgin adjustable pedestal desk, Sold by the 
National School Equipment Company, Minneapolis; the 
Derby adjustable pedestal desk, and the Rowles movable

Organization of classes. “Two different types of classes

not be brought above one fourth), or from corneal opacities,

visual acuity of one fourth or less, or from keratitis (inflam- 
mation of the cornea) with limited acuity or persistent re- 
currence of the symptoms during treatment, or disease of 
the fundus with half vision or less, or hyperopia of more 
than five diopters with symptoms of asthenopia.! 
The classes may be consolidated in a separate central 
school, which will permit a sharper classification of the pu- 
pils, or they may be distributed through the grade schools. 
However, either arrangement should afford the pupils op- 
portunities for contact with the sighted pupils in the in- 
structional and social activities of the school. The sight- 
conservation classrooms should afford constant, natural, 
unilateral illumination, preferably from a northeast expo- 
sure, and adequate artificial lighting, when needed, for in- 
direct or semi-indirect systems. The window illumination 
from an area equal to one fifth of the floor area should be 
made uniform, and glare eliminated through the proper ad- 
justment of two buff-colored shades. The walls should be 
in light buff or dull finished French gray, and the ceilings 
white or cream. The seats should be adjustable, while the 
desks should permit of various angles of elevation (such as 
the Rowles or Model A, referred to on p. 116). 
The assignments to these two kinds of classes may be 
made for full-time or part-time instruction. Blind pupils 
after spending several years on full time should be/provided 
with readers and be given a chance in the regular grades. 
Pupils who are not so gravely handicapped visually and who 
are abler mentally may be prepared during given periods in 
the sight-saving classes to recite in the classes for the sighted. 
But they should not be required to do work imposing a se-

vere strain on vision, more especially when they are suffering 
from deteriorating vision. ¢ 
Enrollment. The enrollment should vary from ten to 
about twenty pupils, depending on the number of pupils 
who can be grouped into classes, on whether the class con- 
tains only full-time pupils, or only part-time pupils, or both 
full-time and part-time pupils, or only pupils who spend 
limited portions of their time in the classes preparing les- 
sons for other classes. 
Discharge of pupils. In addition to the elastic system of 
transfers and assignments suggested above, pupils whose 
vision has sufficiently improved to enable them to cope with 
the instruction without undue ocular or other handicap 
should be transferred to the regular grades or the sight con- 
servation classes. 
Curriculum. In the case of the blind, emphasis should be 
plaeed on teaching the pupils to read and write by means of 
the revised Braille method (see p. 11f), while large type, 
widely spaced paper, soft pencils and occasionally individual 
blackboards should be used for the partially sighted. Lib- 
eral use should be made of the oral method of presentation. 
The course should follow, so far as possible, the regular ele- 
mentary curriculum in the case of the mentally normal 
blind or visually handicapped. The instruction for the 
backward cases should be more concrete, objective, and prac- 
tical. The feeble-minded blind should be transferred to the 
classes for the feeble-minded after having been given a 
chance at touch reading. Gifted pupils should be given 
every opportunity to develop their special talents and to fit 
themselves for the highest type of service of which they are 
capable. An increasing amount of industrial arts and vo- 
cational training should be supplied, as the child grows older, 
selected with reference to his present interests and capac- 
ities and his probable after-career. The aim should be to

It is in our judgment not necessary, however, to proscribe 
entirely the pantomimic and manual methods of communi- 
cation. These methods are not without merit in the case of 
the deaf of limited intelligence who never acquire proficiency 
in lip-reading, or those with or without speech defects who 
cannot acquire intelligible or articulate speech. These 
methods also possess value as supplementary tools of com- 
munication. The method of teaching lip-reading should 
utilize every avenue of approach through the eye and touch. 
Preliminary sensori-motor training should be given to the 
young. Liberal use should be made of the voice in speech 
and song, and various instruments in the production of 
sounds and music. Beyond adapting the literary instruc- 
tion to the pupils’ stage of mental and educational develop- 
ment, a great variety of manumental and prevocational 
activities should be provided, such as reedwork, manual 
training, wood-turning, wood-carving, mechanical drawing, 
dressmaking, tailoring, cleaning, pressing, fancy work, 
mattress-making, millinery, sewing, housework, laundering, 
baking, cobbling, printing, sign-painting, photography, 
auto-repairing, bookbinding, bookkeeping, engraving, type- 
writing, barbering, dairying, gardening, and brick and stone 
laying. The aim should always be to develop skill in crafts 
and occupations in which deafness will not constitute an 
undue handicap, to develop special talents, and to give every 
opportunity to exceptionally gifted pupils to realize their 
highest possibilities, 
Besides the (a) preliminary and (b) basic training, the 
teachers should possess (c) special training and experience 
in the method of oral instruction, in teaching lip-reading, 
speech improvement and speech correction for deaf children, 
and in the sensori-motor and occupational work appropriate 
for the deaf. They should possess knowledge of the causes 
and varying conditions of defective audition, and of the
-P-A-G-E-142

124 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
hygiene of the ear. They should be messengers of infor- 
mation to parents and pupils on the importance of giving 
prompt attention to ear infection. 
Prevalence of the deaf and hard of hearing. In the 1920 
. census, 44,885 deaf persons were reported in the United 
States, or one for every 2350 of the general population, while 
the corresponding ratio in 1910 was one for every 2060. 
CorrREcTION oF SPEECH DEeFrects 
Eligibility. Pupils are eligible for training who are sub- 
ject to some form of speech obstruction, defect, or disorder 
which is amenable to correction or improvement, such as 
baby talk, defective phonation, nasality, lisping, lalling, 
cluttering, stammering, stuttering, etc. The training is not 
primarily intended for children who merely mispronounce or 
misenunciate or express themselves inaptly, unidiomatically 
and incorrectly for reasons other than defects of speech. 
All pupils should receive training in speech improvement and 
expression, but this training should be given by the regular 
teachers. 
The most essential phase of the certifying examination is 
the determination of the type and degree of the speech dis- 
order. An attempt should be made to discover the causa- 
tive factors, which, however, are frequently hidden in im- 
penetrable obscurity. Many cases before the treatment is 
begun should be given the benefit of a physical examination, 
especially of the speech-producing and auditory mechanism, 
with physical treatment, when indicated, and a psychologi- 
cal examination, including the determination of the “intelli- 
gence level” and the discovery of the possible operative and 
causative mental mechanisms. 
Organization of centers. It will occasionally be desirable 
to assign pupils with grave speech disorders, or with speech 
disorders which exert a deleterious influence upon other 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  PHYSICAL, SPEECH, AND CONDUCT DEFECTIVES 125 
pupils, owing to the propensity of some pupils to imitate the 
defects, to speech correction classes for full-time assignment 
until they are improved, cured, or dismissed as incurable. 
But the most economical arrangement is to establish centers 
to which pupils from adjoining schools may be sent for 
speech training during two or more exercises per week. 
Methods of correction. Many of the exercises, particu- 
larly the introductory physical exercises, breathing exer- 
cises, tongue and lip gymnastics, articulation drills, voice 
placement, and rhythmic speech drills, may be given as col- 
lective exercises to from ten to twenty pupils in a group. 
These exercises, however, should be supplemented by indi- 
vidual training adjusted to the needs of each child. The 
physical training and voice exercises should be reinforced by 
the removal of hampering physical obstructions and the 
psychological factors which may produce or aggravate the 
speech disability. 
It is of imperative importance to secure the active codper- 
ation of both the child and the child’s family, so that the 
practice will be continued at home, and so that conditions 
will not develop in the home which are inimical to the child’s 
progress. It is important to instruct parents and teachers 
how to handle the child with a speech defect so that they 
will further his improvement instead of unwittingly ob- 
structing it. 
In order to cope expeditiously and effectively with the 
problem of speech defectiveness, the schools should offer a 
minimum amount of training in the improvement and cor- 
rection of speech to all kindergarten and primary teachers so 
that they may correct the simple, uncomplicated cases of 
lisping and baby talk early in the child’s school career, thus 
leaving the more complicated cases for the special speech 
correction teachers. In fact, it would be desirable to make 
this training available to the pre-kindergarten speech de-
-P-A-G-E-144

fective during certain periods of the week. Many parents 
could be taught to assist in the exercises. 
Qualifications of teachers. The specific technical train- 
ing (c), in addition to (a) and (b), (p. 110), should include 
courses on the anatomy and physiology of the organs of 
speech, the psychology and psychopathology of speech dis- 
orders and defects, the detailed technique of correcting the 
defects, together with observation of, and practice experi- 
ence in, the examination and correction of speech impedi- 
ments of various kinds. A study of psychoanalysis is not 
without value, provided it does not become a fetish and 
obsession. 
Prevalence of speech defectives. Based upon my St. 
Louis survey, almost three per cent of all the children in the 
elementary and secondary schools in the populous urban 
communities suffer from speech defects and disorders of 
varying degree, not including a considerable number of 
cases of foreign accent, patois, or brogue. 
CuassgEs FoR DELINQUENTS AND TRUANTS 
While the classes for the mentally defective and back- 
ward should in no sense be made dumping grounds for all 
types of truant, delinquent, obstreperous, and vicious chil- 
dren, many such children will prove to be backward or feeble- 
minded and will respond properly in respect to deportment, 
attendance, and application when placed under the appealing 
régime of the classes for the subnormals. There seems to be 
no reason why such pupils should be transferred to classes 
for the ungovernable, immoral, or vicious. Assignment to 
such classes should be the last resort. Nevertheless defi- 
cient delinquents who do not thus respond, and intellectu- 
ally normal, unstable, or neurotic delinquents who cannot be 
controlled in the regular grades and who are a menace to the 
other pupils should be transferred to day or residential dis-
-P-A-G-E-145
  
PHYSICAL, SPEECH, AND CONDUCT DEFECTIVES 127 
ciplinary schools, separately maintained for boys and girls, 
and retained there until they can be returned to the other 
classes without detriment to themselves or to the other 
pupils. It is of primary importance that these classes be 
placed in charge of teachers, preferably men for boys, who, 
besides having all the professional qualifications suggested 
on page 110, should possess wholesome, robust personalities, 
and a spirit of unaffected camaraderie which will enable them 
to win the pupils and become virtally interested in their wel- 
fare. They should be able to take the éhildren out on worth- 
while tramps and on field and industrial excursions, to exer- 
cise an elevating influence on their extra-school interests and 
pursuits, help to stabilize their instincts, develop habits of 
application and industry, and the desire to become indus- 
trially efficient, and honorable and just in their dealings with 
other people. The effort must be made to develop a civic 
consciousness, a sense of responsibility, and a desire to serve 
others. The teaching job is not merely that of providing a 
literary and industrial arts program suited to the pupils’ 
abilities — and this will go a long ways toward preventing 
dependency and delinquency — but of developing ideals, 
lofty ambitions, anda proper morale.

CHAPTER VI 
THE TECHNIQUE OF ORGANIZING SPECIAL INSTRUC- 
TION FOR THE MENTALLY INFERIOR AND 
EDUCATIONALLY DEFICIENT 
Examination procedure. No child should be assigned to a 
class for the mentally deficient who has not been given the 
complete individual examination suggested on p. 105. Ef- 
forts should in all cases be made to secure a reliable history 
of the child’s social characteristics and school progress, and 
an accurate determination of his capacities and incapaci- 
ties, particularly the stage of development of his intelli- 
gence, judgment, and understanding, and his psycho-motor 
ability. It is recommended that, whenever possible, equally 
thorough examinations be given children who are on the 
borderline of mental deficiency, or who are very seriously 
backward, or who are subject to obvious or pronounced 
specific mental or educational disabilities. Less gravely re- 
tarded or affected pupils may be assigned upon the basis of 
the result of instruction, properly authenticated, or of 
standardized group psychological or educational tests, or 
both, to ungraded classes or sections subserving the func- 
tions of clearing houses. 
Schemes for adjusting instruction to individual needs. A 
highly flexible and comprehensive scheme of organization is 
required to enable the larger schools economically and effec- 
tively to meet the needs of the very diverse grades and types 
of children, other than those already considered, who are 
lacking in mental potentials or in educational ability, or who 
are subject to specific mental or pedagogical disabilities, or 
who are pedagogically retarded but mentally normal. In
-P-A-G-E-148

order adequately to meet the needs of this varied group of 
mentally or educationally maladjusted children, the follow- 
ing organization of classes, divisions, or schemes for render- 
ing individual assistance is suggested: 
1. Classes for the mental deficients. 
2. Shop or industrial centers for older mental deficients. 
3. Classes for the backward, dull, and restoration cases. 
4, Prevocational centers or elementary industrial schools 
for the backward and motor minded. 
5. Divisions, sections, abbreviated curricula, coaching 
teachers, subject promotion, shortened promotion in- 
tervals, use of effective methods and devices, and dy- 
namic incentives, ete.

Nomenclature. These classes should be referred to as spe- 
cial schools for individual instruction, opportunity classes, 
developmental classes, orthogenic classes, or by some other 
designations which will not wound the sensibilities of the 
parents. ‘ 
Admission standard. The boundary lines for this group 
should be conservatively drawn both at the bottom and at 
the top, on the general principle, which is an axiom at law 
and which must never be forgotten in school practice, that 
the benefit of the doubt must always be given the child. 
Mental deficients with less than a three-year mentality 
(Binet-Simon age) or less than an 1.Q. of 30, or with more 
than a nine-year mentality or more than an I.Q. of 70, and 
children who have the capacity to do satisfactory all-round 
third-grade work in the literary branches, should not be ad- 
mitted to these classes. This gives a range of seven mental 
years, and 40 I.Q.’s., and from sub-kindergarten to beginning 
third-grade achievement. While contrasting sharply with 
current practice in many cities, I do not hesitate to affirm,
-P-A-G-E-149
  
INSTRUCTION FOR MENTALLY INFERIOR 181 
after extended experience in administering special public- 
school classes, that the range of mental and pedagogical abil- 
ity represented between these limits is as large as it should 
be from the standpoint of the best interests of the children 
and the efficient administration of the instruction, especially 
when the pupils of these varying grades of ability are taught 
in the same class. 
Rigid standards necessarily arbitrary; too drastic exclu- 
sions. The limits set out above are confessedly somewhat 
arbitrary, as any standard must be to be rendered workable 
at all in the hands of different officials. For example, one 
would scarcely be expected to enter for the first time a thir- 
teen-year-old child with a three-year mentality in a public 
school special class, nor would one be expected to retain in- 
definitely a low-grade child who had proved incapable of 
making any appreciable improvement. Nevertheless, I 
have noted fairly satisfactory progress in some low-grade 
pupils who appeared to be entirely hopeless at first and who 
would have been summarily excluded from some school sys- 
tems. One may easily become too drastic in rejecting from 
the special classes as uneducable children near the bottom of 
the curve of ability. 
Too liberal admissions. On the other hand, the benefit of 
the doubt should also be given to the child who grades along 
the upper boundary line. A “borderline” child, or one of 
uncertain mentality, should not be assigned to a special class 
for the lower grades of mental deficients but to an ungraded 
class. There are cogent reasons why the examiner should 
not be overhasty in classifying the large number of children 
whose mental status is uncertain. The importunity for im- 
mediate results easily fosters the habit of reaching precipi- 
tate diagnoses, and must be checked by the cultivation of an 
attitude of judicious discretion. 
Why judicious caution must be exercised in the diagnosis
-P-A-G-E-150
  ‘182. EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN , 
of mental deficiency. Many circumstances may impel to 
overhasty decisions. The examiner is often importuned to 
deliver a diagnosis “right off the bat.” The teacher may 
have been precipitate in recommending the transfer because 
she had grown weary or despondent over the child. Some 
children are merely apparently deficient, because of the op- 
eration of various factors: irregular attendance in school; 
lack of interest in, or application to, the school work; an at- 
titude of defiance or negativism toward a particular teacher 
and determination not to learn or to recite; motor restless- 
ness from excess of energy, neuroticism, or lack of volitional 
control, with concomitant distractibility of attention; ap- 
athy, inability or unwillingness to recite because of a speech 
defect or difficulty of expression, the presence of which may 
not always be recognized because of the obscure nature of 
the disorder; the presence of emotional disturbances, con- 
flicts, inhibitions, phobias, anxieties, obsessions, infantile 
fixations, or submerged complexes,! the presence of which 
may not be suspected; temporary illnesses, injuries, or dele- 
terious physical or social influences; a slow rate of develop- 
ment with possibilities of eventually catching up; tempo- 
rary stagnation on a “resting plateau”; racial differences; 
defects in the measuring scales, and the like. 
The Slavic child, to refer to racial differences, tends to be 
heavy and sluggish, and the Latin restless, shifting, volatile, 
and voluble, with rather unstable attention so far as con- 
cerns the ordinary school tasks. The German child is usu- 
ally thorough, even if inclined to be rather slow. 
The child’s performance in the formal tests may be af- 
fected by obscure personality traits not only in his own 
1 The Freudians hold that many dull, tired, indolent children are merely 
inhibited by “infantile fixations,” anxieties, and conflicts, which do not 
respond to punishment, coercion, or rewards but only to psychoanalytic 
treatment.

make-up but also in the examiner’s make-up. The intelli- 
gence age-ratings obtained by the individual scale in most 
frequent use (the Stanford-Binet) are too low in many age 
levels for which the diagnostician should, but frequently 
does not, make due allowance. 
Because of the operation of these and other factors, the 
child’s real level of ability may not always be correctly 
gauged by his performance in the school work or in the stand- 
ardized educational and psychological tests. 
Doubtful cases to be kept under observation. ‘The pro- 
posed upper limit of 70 I.Q. and a Binet-Simon age of up to, 
but not including, ten is admittedly too high in many cases, 
especially when the Stanford-Binet scale is used. We have 
known children of 65 I.Q., and even less, who have had 
enough ability of various kinds to achieve a considerable 
degree of success in life. We have known the descendants 
of parents no more highly endowed who have achieved not 
only success but eminence. Therefore we plead earnestly 
for the general adoption of a policy of judicious discretion 
and suspension of judgment in dealing with children of 
doubtful mental diagnosis who occupy a rather wide “bor- 
derline zone,” ranging from an I.Q. of 65 or less to about 80. 
Such pupils should be assigned on probation for a thorough 
try-out in an ungraded, observation, or “adjustment” (A. 
H. Sutherland) class, where they can be carefully observed 
under the advantages of special aid and expert instruction. 
Nature of the observations to be made. What observa- 
tions should the teacher make on such children, or in fact on 
all school children? Among the most important character- 
istics to observe are the following: 
a. Pedagogical peculiarities. The ungraded teacher with 
her opportunities for intensive, individual work, should be 
able to determine accurately the status of the child in the 
various branches at the time of matriculation, and the de- 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
134 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
gree of progress he has been able to make under special in- 
struction within a given period of time. What are the 
child’s special pedagogical defects, interests, and talents? 
What causes can be discovered for his special handicaps? 
The teachers’ report should always indicate the level of ac- 
complishment or efficiency which the child has actually 
reached in the different branches under the superior advan- 
tages afforded. 
b. Psychological peculiarities; interest and attention. — 
What pronounced or dominant interests in the activities in 
and out of school can be found? What are the child’s qual- 
ities of attention? Is there depth and persistence of atten- 
tion? Can it be easily aroused and fixed? Can the child 
become completely immersed or absorbed in anything? Or 
is there a persistent state of high distractibility of attention? 
Is aprosexia present? If so, what is the cause? 
Memory. Does the child’s memory possess a high degree 
of impressionability, tenacity of retentiveness, and ease of 
recall? Does he memorize easily but forget rapidly? Is his 
memory level higher than his intelligence or comprehension 
level? 
Intelligence. Is he slow to grasp, is his judgment weak, is 
he unable to reason cogently, especially in dealing with ab- 
stractions? How much retarded is he according to the 
standardized tests? In a word, is the child lacking in mental 
alertness, ability, or strength? 
The teacher may find it convenient to classify the child 
provisionally with respect to intellectual ability into the five 
traditional classes: very superior, superior, average, inferior, 
and very inferior. 
Motor traits. What are the child’s motor traits? Is he 
restless, quick or slow in execution, precise or incodrdinate in 
his movements, is he “motor-minded,” “mechanically in- 
clined,” interested in manipulative and constructive activ-
-P-A-G-E-153
  
INSTRUCTION FOR MENTALLY INFERIOR = 135 
ities? In what types of mechanical or practical arts activ- 
ities is he especially interested and capable? Fortunately 
many children who are conspicuously inferior in the verbal 
intelligence tests, possess considerable aptitude in mechan- 
ical and industrial activities. 
Emotional and social traits. What are the child’s emo- 
tional peculiarities? Is he emotionally unstable, excitable, 
phlegmatic, or imperturbable? Is he given to brooding? 
Is he unsocial, seclusive, solitary, “shut in”? Does he 
avoid play? Is he irritable, sensitive, passionate, rough, 
coarse, destructive, cruel, malicious, implacable? Does he 
enjoy tormenting or inflicting pain on his fellows or animals? 
Is he subject to sexual irregularities, aberrations, perver- 
sions, or precocities? Many weak-minded children are sub- 
ject to temperamental and emotional abnormalities. 
c. Complex indicators. The Freudians stress the necessity 
of watching for the presence of “complex indicators” which 
they allege point to submerged complexes indicative of re- 
pressions and conflicts in the child’s unconscious life. Among 
such indicators are mentioned: 
(1) Physical signs: stuttering, twitchings, disturbances 
of writing, neuralgia, pains in the head and stomach, skin 
eruptions, hysterical or allied neurotic manifestations. 
(2) Psychic signs, of three types: 
(a) Anxiety phenomena. The child may be afraid when called 
upon to recite, and therefore remains entirely unresponsive, 
not even betraying a gesture, in consequence of which he may 
be considered stupid or lazy. A special type of phobia, re- 
ferred to as ‘examination anxiety” (or fear of examina- 
tions), is ascribed to the “father complex” (the fear of the 
father transferred to the teacher) or the “mother complex” 
(the fear of the mother similarly transferred), and represents 
a damming up of the child’s eroticism. Stuttering and 
writer’s cramp are also included among the “anxiety phe- 
nomena.”
-P-A-G-E-154
136 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
(b) Obsessions (besetting ideas which more or less persistently 
urge to action), among which are included stereotyped ges- 
tures, ceremonials in walking (such as stepping on or avoid- 
ing cracks, counting steps, posts, or stairs), elaboration of a 
secret speech or writing, mistakes in speech and writing 
(slips of the pen or tongue), senseless habits of writing (exe- 
cuting flourishes, shadings, or certain loops), laughing at 
serious remarks, obsessional washing, agoraphobia (dread of 
being in or crossing open spaces), and claustrophobia (mor- 
bid apprehension of being in inclosed spaces.) 
(c) Abulia or “deficiency of will,” in which the subject is over- 
whelmed by conscious or unconscious motives, so that he 
becomes impotent to make decisions or to act. It is well to 
observe these and other typical phenomena which, according 
to the Freudians, crop out in normal and abnormal subjects 
from unconscious trains of thought induced by subconscious 
complexes which have not been resolved or dissipated, but 
great caution must be exercised in attempting to interpret 
the signs. Premature conclusions must be avoided in this 
obscure realm, in which unbridled speculation has run riot, 
until more authenticated knowledge is at hand. 
Organization of classes. The tendency in the United 
States, in contrast with Europe, is to establish separate 
classes in the regular school buildings. St. Louis, where 
nearly all of the classes are located not only in centers con- 
taining two or three classes, but in “special schools” located 
entirely apart from the other schools, is a shining exception. 
Every school administration should give most careful con- 
sideration to the relative advantages of establishing single 
class units or centralized schools. What are some of the 
advantages and disadvantages attaching to each type of or- 
ganization? 
Advantages of establishing two or more classes in a spe- 
cial class center in the grade building or in a segregated 
school. (1) Better grouping. The special school permits of 
decidedly better classification or grouping of the pupils for
-P-A-G-E-155
  
INSTRUCTION FOR MENTALLY INFERIOR = 137 
purposes of instruction. In the single-class school the 
teacher must handle all grades and all types of pupils. Be- 
cause of the limited number of pupils available, only a few 
can be assigned to a group, perhaps only two or three. 
Hence the teacher must spend a large portion of her time 
in teaching pupils singly, and the children must, in conse- 
quence, spend a large part of their time in seat work, which 
is sometimes rather profitless because of lack of supervision. 
On the other hand, when there are numerous children in a 
center, more pupils can be found of similar mental levels, 
educational attainments, and handicaps, hence more pupils 
can be assigned to each group, and more groups can be 
formed. With three teachers in a center, it would easily 
be possible to classify the children into at least half a dozen 
groups, and possibly into eight or ten. The economic ad- 
vantage of this arrangement is quite patent. It will make 
possible an increase of the class registration by at least half 
a dozen pupils without increasing the teaching load. 
Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that individual in- 
struction must never be wholly abandoned. It is of the very 
essence of special class work. All pupils will require individ- 
ual attention in certain branches, and certain anomalous 
types in practically everything. 
(2) Departmentalization; (a) advantages to the teacher. The 
consolidated school makes possible the introduction of de- 
partmental instruction. In the single-class unit the teacher 
must offer all of the instruction. But few teachers possess 
sufficient versatility and skill to do all phases of the required 
work equally well, and sufficient strength and resolution to 
keep up with the developments in all the fields of special 
class work. In the special school the teachers can specialize, 
one teacher carrying certain branches and the other teachers 
other branches. This will afford the aggressive teacher the 
opportunity to become a specialist. She will have time to
-P-A-G-E-156
    188 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
study her particular teaching problems more thoroughly, to 
digest all of the important literary contributions, and to 
thoroughly analyze the particular difficulties and needs of 
each child in the field of her specialties. No one can be ex- 
pected to keep abreast of the times in all branches of instruc- 
tion, but the schools have a right to require a teacher to keep 
up with the advance in her specialty. Let no one succumb 
to the delusion that because the special class teacher is deal- 
ing with mentally inferior minds she can rest on her oars. 
These minds have set problems which the ablest students 
have not yet successfully solved. We have not yet reached 
the stage of finality in the pedagogy of the mentally handi- 
capped. ‘There are still vast opportunities for improve- 
ment in the classification and teaching technique of sub- 
normals, and there is no escape from stagnation, even in 
this field, except through constant study, wakefulness, and 
enterprise. 
An incidental advantage of the departmental plan to the 
teacher is that she is brought into contact with more minds, 
which will afford her welcome relief from the monotony and 
boredom of close confinement to a small group of pupils. 
(b) Advantages to the pupil. The advantage to the pupil 
is obvious. He will receive instruction from a number of 
teachers, some of whom are stronger in one thing, others in 
another, and all of whom will differ in personality make-up. 
We recognize the importance of providing a change of 
teacher personality in the grades by passing the child from 
teacher to teacher every semester or every year, instead of 
keeping him with the same teacher. The disadvantage of 
keeping the child under the tutelage of the same teacher 
might not be great if the teacher were an unusually capable 
one, but it would be little less than tragic to restrict a child 
during his whole school career to one teacher if she happened 
to be inefficient, eccentric, abnormal or neurotic. Many de-
-P-A-G-E-157
INSTRUCTION FOR MENTALLY INFERIOR = 139 
fectives in one-room schools spend their entire school career 
with one teacher. 
(c) Administrative advantages and disadvantages. The de- 
partmentalization of the work also tends to create a better 
spirit in the school, a more cohesive organization, more co- 
operation, and more team work. The necessity of observ- 
ing a time schedule serves as a valuable check on the tend- 
ency, sometimes evident in the special classes, of conduct- 
ing the work without definite plan, system, or program. 
Under such a system some teachers tend to overemphasize 
the lines of work in which they are particularly interested, 
and neglect others, often to the detriment of the pupils. 
The departmental plan can be successfully operated only on 
a time schedule, which, of course, has its disadvantages. 
The departmental system is more difficult to administer. 
Children must pass from room to room, and floor to floor at 
regular intervals. It is more difficult to employ the project 
and correlation methods unless all the teachers take special 
pains to codperate and to correlate their instruction around 
the “correlation core.” Centering instruction around one 
project is easily managed when one teacher handles all the 
branches. This is perhaps the greatest drawback attaching 
‘to departmentalization. 
(3) Better equipment. The central school will probably 
receive a more adequate equipment than a single class, since 
more pupils can use the equipment, thus reducing the per 
pupil cost. 
(4) Prevention of conflicts between normal and defective 
children. The pupils are removed from contact with the 
normal child, when the school is located apart from the 
grade school. Some contend that mentally deficient children 
exercise a bad influence on the normals, and hence should be 
removed from their presence. Others contend that the nor- 
mal children annoy, ridicule, tease, or “bully-rag” the men- 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
i 
140 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
tally deficient, who should therefore be removed for protec- 
tion. Based upon actual experience in the administration of 
special schools nearly all of which were located some dis- 
tance from a grade school, I do not hesitate to affirm that 
mentally defective children are much happier in a segregated 
special school center, provided the school is properly housed, 
environed, and organized, and provided the parents do not 
make the children discontented, as is sometimes the case, 
because of their slow progress or inability to return to the 
grades. 
Alleged advantages of the separate rooms in the regular 
school building. (1) Classes more accessible. There are 
more class units, hence classes are scattered through more 
buildings, and are thus made more accessible to the pupils. 
This is an element of economy and convenience. Many pu- 
pils can walk to school, who would otherwise have to be 
transported in street cars or busses. 
(2) Less opposition to assignments. There is less pa- 
rental objection. It attracts less attention to transfer a child 
to another room in the same school than to a different school, 
especially when the latter is a segregated special school. 
The parents are very sensitive to the comments made regard- 
ing such a transfer, especially the comments of their neigh- 
bors, because of the feeling that a stigma attaches to the 
transfer to a special school, to which opprobrious terms are 
not infrequently applied. They feel that if the child contin- 
ues in the same school the neighbors will be none the wiser. 
It is also felt that the grouping of many abnormals in a 
center throws the abnormalities into bolder relief, thus mak- 
ing them more obvious to outsiders, and making the chil- 
dren more conscious of their peculiarities and inferiorities. 
The heightened parental objection is undoubtedly one of 
the greatest drawbacks to centralizing the children in segre- 
gated buildings, although offensive epithets are just as freely
-P-A-G-E-159
  
  INSTRUCTION FOR MENTALLY INFERIOR 141 
or even more freely applied to the classes when they are es- 
tablished in the regular buildings, where their purpose soon 
becomes known to all the pupils. 
(3) Grade teachers will visit oftener. When the classes 
are in the grade buildings they are more accessible to visits 
by the principal and the other teachers. It is contended 
that the teachers of the normal would benefit from contact 
with these classes. True, but few teachers avail themselves 
of this opportunity even when the classes are in the grade 
building. Those who desire could, no doubt, receive permis- 
sion equally readily to visit the nearest special school center. 
(4) Earlier transfer. The deficient child will be trans- 
ferred earlier, because if the special class is in the grade 
building the teachers and principal will constantly be on the 
alert for children who may need its benefits. This argument 
probably possesses little weight in the modern school system 
in which systematic methods of locating deficient children 
have been adopted and in which no child can be transferred 
until duly certified after a special examination. 
(5) Deficients learn imitatively from normals. It gives 
the pupils the benefit of association with the normal children 
during the recreation periods, intermissions, and general as- 
semblies. It is argued that mental deficients learn much 
imitatively from the normal pupils, and that this tends to 
advance them socially, educationally, and intellectually. 
Parents are wont to dilate on these benefits, and also on the 
fear that if their children are assigned to special classes they 
will be “dragged down” mentally and morally and will ac- 
quire imitatively many objectionable practices from the 
other children. There may forsooth be some advantages 
obtained from the association with the normals, but these 
have been overrated. In point of fact, in many school sys- 
tems where the special classes are in the regular buildings, it 
is found necessary or desirable to keep the special children
-P-A-G-E-160
142, EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
apart from the normal so far as possible in order to avoid 
the conflicts which often arise. They observe different 
periods for the intermissions and for the dismissals. 
(6) Special schools more expensive. The special schools are 
more expensive per pupil when located in segregated build- 
ings, when, as is sometimes the case, it is necessary to pay 
rental on the building, engage a special janitor or attendant, 
and carry a separate fuel expense. In 1919-20 the average 
cost per pupil in the special schools in St. Louis was $180, as 
compared with $129 per pupil in a single class which did not 
have a rental expense or a separate janitor or a fuel account. 
This objection does not, of course, apply to the centers 
located in the grade schools. 
To summarize: From the standpoint of the efficiency of 
the instruction the advantages are decidedly in favor of the 
centralized segregated special school, particularly if the 
building and grounds offer the advantages which such a 
school should have, namely an assembly room, a gymna- 
sium, an academic recitation room, a manual training room, 
a room for raffia, reed, sewing, and kindred activities, a 
kitchenette (one of the other rooms can be cleared for a 
dining-room), a laundry-room, a stock-room, toilets and 
baths, playgrounds and grounds for economic and decorative 
gardening. 
2. Soop Centers ror THE Mentatiy Dericient 
There should be established shop or semi-vocational 
schools equipped to provide economically useful forms of in- 
dustrial and semi-trade training for the higher grades of men- 
tal deficients. The transfer should be made to these schools 
one or two years before the children are allowed to leave 
school. Separate schools should, preferably, be maintained 
for the boys and the girls. 
Discharge of pupils. While these classes are not designed
-P-A-G-E-161
  INSTRUCTION FOR MENTALLY INFERIOR 148 
to be restoration classes it may happen, through error of 
diagnosis, that children who have been assigned are not defi- 
cient. The teacher should be constantly on the alert to dis- 
cover such pupils in order that they may be transferred as 
soon as possible to other types of classes. 
Prevalence. The estimates of the number of feeble-minded 
children in the grades vary from about one third of one per 
cent to three or four per cent. My own estimate, based on 
many years of experience in several large school systems, is 
that only about one half of one per cent of the elementary 
pupils in large school systems can be diagnosed as genuinely 
feeble-minded from the standpoint of the socio-industrial or 
legal definition suggested in Chapter III. If we deduct the 
low-grade mental defectives who will be excluded and others 
who will be privately cared for or who will not enter the pub- 
lic schools, it is probable that the average large school sys- 
tem will need to provide accommodations in the classes for 
the mentally deficient for rather less than one per cent of the 
grade pupils, if the admissions are restricted in accordance 
with the recommendations made on page 130. Some of 
these pupils will eventually prove not to be feeble-minded, 
socially considered. 
It must, however, be emphasized that the proportion of 
mentally deficient children will vary greatly from school to 
school in the same school system, depending upon social, 
economic, racial, and other factors. 
Variation of the proportion of mentally inferior children 
with social and economic standing. This variation appeared 
clearly in the distribution of the feeble-minded and border- 
line children found by the writer in the different St. Louis 
public schools during a six-year period. During the first tri- 
ennium of this period the principals were asked to refer for 
examination the children who were assumed to be mentally 
defective. During the latter triennium the schools were re-
-P-A-G-E-162
144 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
quired to report each year on especially prepared blanks the 
one per cent of pupils who were judged to be the most defi- 
cient in intelligence. The writer then selected for individual 
examination those who seemed from the data submitted to 
be of the lowest grade of mentality. After these data were 
collected the writer classified the white schools into three 
groups, very superior, fair, and very inferior according to the 
social and economic conditions of the population in each dis- 
trict. The writer was fairly familiar with these conditiéns, 
having made several trips to each special and elementary 
school in the city. However, ten schools were omitted from 
the tabulation because the facts were not sufficiently known. 
Nine schools were classified as very superior, twelve as very 
inferior, and fifty-nine as fair. There was no way of ascer- 
taining the number of different children who had been on the 
school registers during this period. We have therefore used 
the registration figures at the close of the last year of the 
period (5836, 9535, and 41,445 for the three groups in the 
order given above). It is evident that this method of ana- 
lysis, although based on a six-year survey, is subject to vari- 
ous limitations: the growth in the attendance of the schools 
in the three groups during this period may not have been 
uniform, in which case our per cents would be based on at- 
tendance figures which are more or less inaccurate relatively; 
the classification of the schools into the three groups may be 
more or less inaccurate, but probably only slightly so, so far 
as affects the extreme groups; and the attempt to “rout out” 
the mental inferiors may not have been done with the same 
care and vigor in all of the schools, although the effort was 
certainly made during the last three years to ferret out the 
cases wherever they were. 
Recognizing these unavoidable imperfections, it is found 
that the ratio of mentally defective and borderline in the 
socially and economically superior school districts was 0.31 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  INSTRUCTION FOR MENTALLY INFERIOR _ 145 
and 0.31 per cent, respectively; in the inferior districts, 142 ~~ 
and 1.43 per cent, respectively; and in the fair or average dis- 
tricts, 0.55 and 0.74 per cent. The difference between the 
best and the poorest districts is quite striking. (The total 
number of feeble-minded was 383 and borderline 464.) 
These findings are in accord with the results obtained from 
standardized educational and psychological tests. Such 
tests given in America, Belgium, Italy, England, and else- 
where, have shown that the children of the professional 
classes, such as doctors, lawyers, teachers, professors, preach- 
ers, or diplomats, and of the higher social strata are superior 
to the children of skilled laborers, unskilled laborers, serv- 
ants, street vendors, or clerks. 
The consideration of the functions, basic conditions, size, 
and curriculum of the classes for the mentally deficient, and 
the qualifications of the special class teachers is reserved for 
fuller treatment in the next two chapters. 
3. UncrapEp or ADJUSTMENT CLASSES FoR THE BoRDER- 
LINE, BACKWARD, AND RestoRATION CasEs 
Admission requirements. These classes, as already ex- 
plained, serve the purpose of observation classes or clearing 
houses, in conjunction with the psycho-educational clinic or 
division of tests, or as independent clearing houses for chil- 
dren of uncertain mentality when no other clearing-house 
agency is available. 
The following classes of pupils should be considered eligi- 
ble for assignment: (a) subnormal children who are on the 
borderline of mental deficiency, with I.Q.’s running as low as 
65, or even lower. It will eventually appear that some of 
these children are mentally deficient. When this is the case 
they should be transferred to the classes for such pupils. 
Others who will remain on the borderline, or will make con- 
siderable progress and prove to be only backward, will be
-P-A-G-E-164
  146 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
_—tTetained in the ungraded classes. (b) Intellectually back- 
ward children who, while not mentally defective, are incap- 
able of successfully coping with the requirements in the reg- 
ular grades, and who require special assistance and a differ- 
ent program of work. All of these cases will be retained in 
the ungraded classes except those who prove to have more 
potentiality for growth and development than was antici- 
pated. They will be returned to the grades. The above 
types should be transferred on full-time assignments. (c) 
Restoration cases, which include children who are tempora- 
rily mentally retarded and capable of restoration, and chil- 
dren who possess good mentality but are educationally re- 
tarded in one or more branches for various reasons, such as 
late entrance, irregular attendance, frequent transfers, seri- 
ous illness, malnutrition, indifference, lack of application, 
mental conflicts or inhibitions, or poor teaching, but who are 
capable of restoration if given adequate aid in time. These 
children may be given temporary full-time assignments, or 
they may be transferred for one or two recitation periods a 
day for special aid in their weak branch or branches. They 
should be restored to grade as soon as possible. 
Organization of classes. It is highly desirable to establish 
centers of two or more classes, but in the regular grade build- 
ings, so that the pupils may be given every opportunity to 
associate with the normals and to join in the varied congre- 
gate activities of the school. Properly to handle single-unit 
ungraded classes would require an exceptionally versatile 
teacher. She might be called upon to teach everything in 
the regular curriculum from the lowest primary to the gram- 
mar grades, and all the specialties required in physical edu- 
cation, industrial arts, and speech training. Moreover, it 
would be difficult to do complete justice to the pupils in an 
ungraded class containing pupils who may vary in chrono- 
logical age from six or seven to fourteen or fifteen, in mental 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
INSTRUCTION FOR MENTALLY INFERIOR 147 
status from those on the borderline to those who are men- 
tally normal and only educationally deficient, and in educa- 
tional status from sub-first to the fifth or sixth grade. Cen- 
tralization will make it possible to classify the pupils or to 
departmentalize the work. 
Modes of classification. The classification of the pupils 
in the ungraded classes may present a rather complicated ad- 
ministrative problem. There are two chief modes of classi- 
fication, each with its peculiar advantages and also disadvan- 
tages. 
First, the pupils may be classified according to their de- 
gree of mental defect or according to their degree of pro- 
spective improvement, rehabilitation, or restoration. When 
so classified, there would be, preferably, three classes, one for 
the restorable, one for the backward, and one for the border- 
line cases, or at least two classes, namely, one for the restor- 
able and one for the borderline and backward. ‘This ar- 
rangement will make possible a much better adaptation of 
the instruction to the needs of each group and the individ- 
uals in the group. The industrial arts and literary work can 
be better differentiated and proportioned. The teacher can 
hold to a more definite and constant aim for each group. 
For example, if she has a group of restoration children she 
will concentrate on intensive literary instruction. The dis- 
advantage of this arrangement is that the pupils in each 
group may be quite divergent in educational attainments. 
Thus the educational level of the backward cases might very 
well vary from first-grade to fifth- or sixth-grade proficiency. 
Second, the classification may be based on the children’s 
educational achievement level. A large center would per- 
mit of a class for each grade, and a smaller center a class, say, 
for the pupils doing sub-first, first- and second-grade work, 
another class for those doing third- and fourth-grade work, 
and a third class for those doing work above the fourth
-P-A-G-E-166
148 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
grade. This plan of organization makes it possible to group: 
children together who are uniform or fairly uniform in their 
educational advancement (particularly in the literary 
branches). The drawback is that the pupils would be quite 
heterogeneous in mental capacity. Each class would con- 
tain children varying from borderline to mental normality. 
The disadvantage is that the teacher may tend to follow a 
common aim in the handling of all the pupils in a class, no 
matter how much they might differ in mental potentials. 
She may plan the work with a view to the restoration of 
all the pupils although some might be quite incapable of 
restoration. She would find it difficult to adapt the method 
and subject-matter to the varying levels of ability. 
Both plans present advantages and disadvantages, but 
the first plan has, in the writer’s experience, proved superior, 
although it isfrequently more difficult to administer properly. 
Modified plan. Where it is not possible to organize cen- 
ters, a class may be established in one school for one type of 
child, and other classes for other types in other schools, ac- 
cording to the requirements in given districts. Pupils from 
the schools served should, of course, be transferred to the 
classes which most nearly meet their needs. 
Curriculum. The success of the ungraded class depends 
primarily upon the adaptation of the curriculum to the indi- 
vidual needs of an exceedingly varied assortment of men- 
tally and educationally handicapped children. The problem 
with the restoration cases is to provide intensive coaching or 
drill in the regular program of studies, or in the branches in 
which they are particularly weak, so that they may be re- 
turned as soon as possible to the regular grades. While pro- 
vision should be made at the outset for a larger amount of 
hand-work for the borderline and backward than is afforded 
in the regular grades, they should, if admitted young, be 
given every benefit of the doubt, and should receive a very
-P-A-G-E-167
  
INSTRUCTION FOR MENTALLY INFERIOR 149 
considerable amount of instruction in the literary branches 
for several years. But when their limitations in the literary 
subject-matter have been convincingly established, they 
should be given an increasing amount of industrial arts train- 
ing, properly correlated, both because of its practical voca- 
tional utility, and because of its value in rendering the liter- 
ary instruction concrete and meaningful. It is evident that 
these children will receive more literary instruction than the 
children in the schools for mental deficients. But the liter- 
ary instruction must be concretely presented, and it should 
be properly correlated, preferably by means of dynamic 
projects, with the manumental activities, while much use 
should be made of the oral method of presentation. Most 
of the arithmetic work should be orally presented in connec- 
tion with projects. Most of the manumental and prevoca- 
tional activities can be selected, according to the require- 
ments of the pupil material, from those recommended in the 
next chapter for the mentally deficient. 
Success of ungraded class work. The success of the work 
in the classes for the borderline, backward, and restoration 
cases may be judged by the data which I gathered on the 
$111 children who were enrolled during varying periods of 
time in the St. Louis ungraded classes in 1916-17. Accord- 
ing to the principals’ reports, forty-two per cent were re- 
stored to grade, while eighty per cent had made greater prog- 
ress in the ungraded classes than they had previously made 
in the regular grades. The others had not been in the classes 
long enough to “get into their stride,” or were proving to be 
more deficient than was first thought to be the case. 
4, Exementary INDUSTRIAL OR PREVOCATIONAL SCHOOLS 
FOR THE BorpDERLINE, Backwarp,or Moror-MinpEp 
The following types of pupils should be assigned at the 
age of thirteen or fourteen (depending on the age limit of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  150 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
compulsory attendance law) to prevocational schools afford- 
ing a richer and more advanced program of industrial arts or 
semi-vocational (and possibly vocational) training: (1) bor- 
derline and backward children from the ungraded classes; (2) 
children of good or fair mentality who are retarded or disin- 
terested in the literary subject-matter, but who have ability 
in, and inclination for, manual forms of work, and who wish 
to enroll; (3) many troublesome, ungovernable, or truant 
children who do not respond to the literary instruction but 
who would respond to various forms of handwork; and (4) 
children who may not be pedagogically retarded or other- 
wise defective but who look forward to entering the crafts or 
trades and who, because they may have to leave school early 
for work, ought to be given opportunities for industrial 
training, should they so desire. It is preferable to establish 
separate schools for boys and girls. 
Where such schools cannot be established, it may be pos- 
sible for the junior high schools to organize satisfactory in- 
dustrial divisions for these children, provided the entrance 
requirements are lowered sufficiently to admit them. Many 
children on leaving the ungraded classes would not be able 
to complete the sixth or seventh grades satisfactorily. Con- 
tinuation classes might also be so organized as to meet the 
needs, in a measure, of these pupils. 
Discharge of pupils from the ungraded classes. The ques- 
tions of the promotion, return to grade, or transfer to schools 
for the mentally defective have been sufficiently considered 
above. 
Prevalence. The problem of the education of the border- 
line and backward grades of deficients is, at least numeri- 
cally considered, more important than the education of the 
feeble-minded. The number of borderline, potential feeble- 
minded, and backward pupils varies greatly from school to 
school, but would, in the larger school systems, probably in-

clude from three to five per cent of the elementary sc! 
enrollment. The number included in the restoration groups 
who are merely slightly or temporarily retarded mentally, or 
who are pedagogically retarded but mentally normal, can- 
not be estimated with any degree of precision, but it is much 
larger than the combined mentally deficient and backward- 
borderline group. It would probably include about twenty 
per cent of the elementary pupils. It is not necessary, or pos- 
sibly even desirable, that this larger group of educationally 
or mentally retarded pupils should be assigned to special 
classes, except temporarily or on part-time. They can be 
reached more or less satisfactorily through other types of ad- 
ministrative adjustment. Brief mention will be made of 
various schemes which have obtained more or less vogue. 
5. Miscettangous Prians or Devices ror ADJUSTING 
Instruction To THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL PuPIL 
1. Shortening of the promotion intervals. One of the 
earliest administrative plans! adopted for the purpose of 
reducing retardation is the promotion of the pupils semi-an- 
nually or quarterly, so that those who fail will only have to 
repeat one half or one fourth of the year’s work, instead of 
the whole year’s work. The St. Louis plan of quarterly pro- 
motions introduced particularly for the benefit of superior 
pupils in the early seventies, and still in use, is the most con- 
spicuous and probably the most successful short-interval 
promotion scheme. Pedagogical retardation can unques- 
tionably be considerably reduced by reducing the promotion 
interval from ten months to five months, or, better still, to 
ten weeks. 
1 As was shown in Chapter II, the earliest attempt consciously and sys- 
tematically made by the public schools to adapt the contents and methods 
of instruction to the special needs of handicapped children was through the 
establishment of special schools or special classes.
-P-A-G-E-170
          
  UCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
. Sectioning, or grouping pupils into divisions according 
ability, or providing parallel or differentiated courses of 
study. The “Baltimore plan,” which was introduced about 
1898, and which aimed to further the progress of all grades 
of pupils, provided differentiated courses for the dull, aver- 
age, and superior pupils during the first six years. The slow 
pupils, who, apparently, were given more oral and concrete 
instruction and handwork, covered less ground than the 
average or bright. The bright pupils were afforded better 
opportunities in the literary branches, were allowed more 
initiative and entrusted with greater responsibilities. Be- 
yond the sixth grade the instruction was departmentalized, 
promotion was by subject, while the bright pupils were per- 
mitted to pursue extra subjects. The “Santa Barbara plan” 
was similar. 
The Cambridge, Massachusetts, double-track plan pro- 
vided, in its 1910 revision, two parallel courses in the ele- 
mentary grades, one of eight years for the average pupils 
and one of six years for the gifted pupils. Children were 
transferred at various “transfer points” according to indi- 
vidual requirements from the one course to the other. This 
arrangement was designed to promote the interests of gifted 
or superior children, who were enabled to do one third more 
work each year. The Le Mars, Iowa, plan was quite similar. 
In the Elizabeth, New Jersey, plan, which was also essen- 
tially a scheme for the rapid advancement of superior chil- 
dren, the pupils in the eight grades were divided into three 
or more sections according to ability, and were permitted to 
progress as rapidly as possible. Transfers were made from 
section to section according to the pupils’ progress. All 
sections, however, were taught by the same teacher. 
The plan of sectioning children into slow, medium, and 
fast classes on the basis of group tests of intelligence is vig- 
orously advocated and widely followed at the present time.
-P-A-G-E-171
  INSTRUCTION FOR MENTALLY INFERIOR 153 
3. Assistant or unassigned teachers for the laggards, and 
systems of “‘class-individual” instruction. In the original 
“Batavia plan,” introduced into the Batavia, New York, 
schools in 1898, an assistant teacher was added to the room 
“to work up” by developmental instruction (rather than by 
mere “coaching”’) the retarded pupils in order to secure 
equal progress among all the pupils — an objective which, 
of course, cannot be realized with children who are genu- 
inely lacking in mental potentials and who require not only 
individual attention, but a differentiated course of training. 
Later all the teachers gave half their time to individual in- 
struction and half to class instruction. 
In the Newton, Massachusetts, plan an unassigned teacher 
gave special attention to maladjusted pupils, either individ- 
ually, or in divisions, or in small groups. 
Somewhat similar to the revised Batavia plan are the sys- 
tems of individual aid, instruction, and promotion, intro- 
duced into the regular grades years ago by Preston I. Search 
(the “Pueblo plan’) and Frederick Burk (in 1913 in the 
first eight grades of the elementary department of the San 
Francisco State Normal School taught by practice teachers), 
and more recently by C. W. Washburn (in Winnetka, Illi- 
nois) and Helen Parkhurst (in Dalton, Massachusetts). In 
these systems minimum emphasis is placed on group recita- 
tions or on “hearing lessons,” thus leaving the regular 
teacher free to give the needy pupils special aid and instruc- 
tion. Each pupil is allowed to progress as rapidly as possi- 
ble, quite independent of the rate of progress of the other pu- 
pils. In the Winnetka schools the pupils spend three hours 
in individual work and two hours in socialized and self-ex- 
pressive activities, including discussions, group projects, 
dramatizations, field trips, music, and team play. The 
pupils largely teach themselves with the aid of standardized 
educational tests, self-corrective practice materials, and  
-P-A-G-E-172
154 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
“goal books.” The goals represent the definite objectives 
which the child must reach in all the “common essentials,” 
writing, spelling, punctuation, capitalization, number-work, 
reading, etc. Similar systems of individual instruction are 
now in experimental use in many elementary-school systems. 
In the so-called “Dalton laboratory plan,” which has re- 
cently been adopted by thousands of schools, particularly in 
England, the children work individually except for certain 
group activities. Each child assumes the responsibility of 
covering in his own time and pace the required assignments 
in each subject, which are presented in mimeographed 
sheets containing the work to be done in the course of one 
month. After the completion of the assignment the child is 
permitted to proceed to the next assignment. The pupils 
spend much time in laboratories equipped for special sub- 
jects which (in the ideal plan) are in charge of special in- 
structors who answer questions, offer suggestions and aid, 
and exercise general oversight over the laboratory activities. 
It may be observed that there is, after all, less novelty in 
these plans than might be supposed. They represent essen- 
tially a return toward the system of individual instruction 
which obtained before 1680, when, it is alleged, “simulta- 
neous” instruction was first introduced, namely, into the 
Christian Brothers’ schools. J. Landon is authority for the 
statement that as late as 1843 there were 5844 primary 
schools in France in which the instruction was wholly indi- 
vidual. The instruction was largely individual during the 
early period of the American public school system. 
4. Promotion by individual subjects in the grades, as is 
done in the high schools and colleges. The alleged advan- 
tage of this system of school organization is that the pupil 
will be required to repeat only the subjects in which he is de- 
ficient. Only limited use, however, has been made of this 
expedient.
-P-A-G-E-173

5. The organization of all school activities in accordance 
with the principles of an efficient teaching technique and the 
demands of mental hygiene. Indubitably, many pupils 
who fail in their studies would put forth greater effort and 
respond successfully if the rank and file of teachers would 
vitalize their instruction by the use of effective methods and 
devices, dynamic incentives, concrete presentations, vital 
projects and cores of correlation, and constructive activities 
which appeal to the children’s instincts, nascent interests, 
and felt needs. If all instructional and school activities 
were organized in accordance with the requirements of an 
adequate system of mental hygiene, the child’s whole per- 
sonality would be harmoniously developed, the instincts and 
the emotions would be properly controlled and sublimated, 
healthy attitudes toward all the problems of life in school, 
out of school, and after school would be engendered, econom- 
ical and desirable habits of feeling, doing, thinking, and 
studying would be formed, wholesome interests in objective 
realities would displace morbid ruminations and vitiating 
‘introspections, the child would be freed from auto-erotic, in- 
fantile, and selfish fixations, and from phobias, misconcep- 
tions, superstitions, conflicts, repressions, and inhibitions, 
and his energies would be liberated for wholesome, con- 
structive, and creative activities. 
Permanence of the special-class type of organization 
versus the transitoriness of other expedients. While sub- 
ject to obvious limitations and drawbacks, practically all of 
the above plans and expedients for adjusting the school work 
to the needs of the school laggard and for reaching the in- 
dividual pupil possess elements of merit of various kinds. 
Nevertheless, most of the plans have enjoyed merely a tem- 
porary vogue, or have been employed only in limited areas. 
They have eventually been forgotten or abandoned. But 
this fate has not befallen the system of segregating mentally
-P-A-G-E-174
  156 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
deficient and backward children in special classes. The 
special-class type of organization has enjoyed an unbroken 
continuity. Very few large school systems have ever aban- 
doned their system of special classes for mental inferiors, 
and to-day the number of special classes is relatively larger 
than ever before in the history of the American public 
schools. This is, no doubt, due partly to the great relief 
afforded the normal pupils and the regular grade teachers by 
the removal of the holdbacks and the drags, who impeded 
the progress of the class and created difficult problems of 
discipline, and partly to the benefits conferred upon the 
deficient pupils themselves, who responded in the special 
class as they had never responded before, owing to the stim- 
ulus of individual attention and guidance, of differential 
training adapted to individual needs, and of the personal 
touch of a sympathetic, understanding, and properly trained 
teacher. Judging by the present indications, the special- 
class type of organization has come to stay, at least for a 
long time to come. 
Contributions of the modern testing movement to the dis- 
covery and differentiation of educational deviates, to the art 
of educational therapy, and to school organization. The 
recognition of the existence of a high degree of variability or 
of pronounced individual differences among elementary- 
school children of the same age or the same grade classifica- 
tion, and of the need of differential instruction to meet the 
requirements of pronounced educational deviates, antedated 
by decades the intelligence-test and achievement-test move- 
ments. Nevertheless, from the intelligence-testing move- 
ment, which had not attained any appreciable momentum 
before 1910, and from the achievement-testing movement 
which did not arrive until later, we have derived not only 
our keenest and truest appreciation of the extent and impli- 
cations of the problem, but also improved techniques for dis- 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  INSTRUCTION FOR MENTALLY INFERIOR = 157 
covering and differentiating the pupils in need of special in- 
struction. On the other hand, the contribution of the mod- 
ern testing movement has thus far been of much less signifi- 
cance so far as concerns the elaboration of educational 
schemes, plans, and devices, and the modification of cur- 
ricula and of educative processes to meet more completely 
the individual requirements of the pupil material in the 
schools. The essential elements of most systems of cor- 
rective or remedial pedagogy or of instructional plans were 
elaborated many years ago, as has already been shown in 
part. The manual method of teaching the deaf child was 
devised prior to 1620, and the oral method prior to 1740. 
The embossed-line type for teaching the blind child was in 
use by 1786, the Braille point type by 1825 (or 1829, accord- 
ing to Americana), and the New York point type by 1868. 
‘The methods for training the feeble-minded were elaborated 
between 1800 and 1850. The testing movement has not 
wrought any essential modifications or contributed any 
basic innovations in the teaching technique or in the meth- 
ods of adjusting instruction for these primary groups of edu- 
cational defectives, or for children less gravely deficient in 
their sensory, motor, or intellectual equipment. There is 
nothing unique or original about the practice of sectioning 
children into rapid, average, and slow divisions on the basis 
of intelligence tests, which nowadays is vigorously advo- 
cated by the makers and users of these tests, nor is there any- 
thing ultra-modern in the vigorous, organized propagandas 
and drives of our own day in behalf of superior or super- 
normal children. Nevertheless, the educator of to-day 
possesses instruments which enable him to diagnose and 
differentiate educational deviates, and prescribe for their 
educational treatment more intelligently than the educator 
of a few years ago was able to do.

  158 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
The limits of this volume do not permit a review of the nu- 
merous studies made of the prevalence of mentally defective 
and inferior persons in the general population and in the 
schools in Europe and America, nor is it possible to enter 
into a critical evaluation of the methods of investigation 
employed or the conclusions reached. I shall merely venture 
to present a very tentative estimate of the relative distribu- 
tion of the different grades of ability found among elemen- 
tary-school children in the large urban school systems of 
the country, which I regard as fairly conservative. 
Mentally deficient children — rather less than one per cent. 
Not all of these will prove to be feeble-minded in the socio- 
legal acceptation of the term. 
Backward and borderline children — from three to five per cent. 
This includes children who are so backward in general intelli- 
gence as to be in need of special aid and instruction in ungraded 
classes, or prevocational, vocational, or elementary industrial 
schools. Some of these, however, will in the end prove to be re- 
storation cases. 
Children retarded in one or more mental functions or school sub- 
jects — about twenty per cent. 
These children can get along fairly well in the regular grades, 
although they would profit from special aid on part-time or tem- 
porarily. They would naturally be assigned to “slow” sections 
where the children are sectioned according to ability. 
This gives about twenty-five per cent on the minus side of the 
curve of distribution. But some of these will prove to be re- 
storable, while many of the others will possess mental, physical, 
and social assets which will enable them not only to earn their 
livelihood, but achieve distinct success in various walks of life. 
Normal or typical — about sixty per cent. 
This figure is not identical with the theoretical average or 
median. 
Bright or capable — about ten per cent. 
Distinctly capable, talented, or precocious — about five per cent. 
This places about fifteen per cent on the plus side of the curve.

CHAPTER VII 
THE OBJECTIVES OF THE SPECIAL CLASS FOR 
THE MENTALLY DEFICIENT 
Auruovues the discussion in the remaining chapters of Part 
II relates primarily to classes for mental deficients, many of 
the remarks apply equally well to the ungraded classes for 
the borderline and backward. In this chapter will be dis- 
cussed five important functions or aims of the special class. 
1. The special class as a center for scientific observation 
and diagnosis. The special class or special school should be 
conducted as a genuine experimental, observation, or diag- 
nostic school, in which (a) the children’s mental, educa- 
tional, social, moral, and physical peculiarities, abilities, and 
disabilities will be thoroughly, systematically, and continu- 
ously observed and studied by competent teachers and in- 
vestigators with the aid of the best technique which modern 
science affords; in which (b) special educational processes, 
methods, devices, and appliances may be devised, tested, 
perfected, and applied, so that the training may more fully 
overcome the special weaknesses and develop the special ca- 
pacities or talents of each child; and in which (c) the results of 
the instruction may be carefully checked and discriminat- 
ingly evaluated by systematic follow-up work. 
Benefits from scientific study. Let no one imagine that all 
this careful work is futile and superfluous, on the ground 
that we now know all that is worth knowing or can be known 
regarding the educational, social, and physical care of the 
mentally underprivileged child. The gaps in our knowledge 
are still very wide. If the classes are conducted as scientific, 
diagnostic schools, we shall acquire a body of useful attested 
   
-P-A-G-E-180
162 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
knowledge regarding abnormal children which cannot be 
secured by the present haphazard methods of unrecorded 
observation. We shall discover that the classroom teacher 
is beginning to form the habit of consciously, deliberately, 
and continuously attempting to adapt and readapt the 
instruction to meet the developing needs of each child; while 
the scientific student of education will eventually discover 
the methods, processes, aids, and materials which are the 
most effective in the training of various grades and types of 
defectives. The conclusions reached will be of value not 
only in the elaboration and systematization of the corrective 
pedagogy for the mentally handicapped, but also for the edu- 
cation of normal children. The case data accumulated will, 
finally, be of very great service for vocational guidance, en- 
abling the counselor to give more intelligent and accurate 
recommendations regarding the after-care needed by each 
child and the type of employment for which he is best suited. 
The alert, intelligent special-class teacher has incomparable 
opportunities for discovering the special weaknesses, talents, 
skills, and interests possessed by the children who have been 
‘ under her observation, many of them for many years. 
Conditions essential for scientific, diagnostic special-class 
work. In order to realize this important ideal of special 
class work, two prime essentials must be supplied. First, 
: the classes must be placed in charge of scientifically-minded 
teachers, particularly those who are psychologically minded, 
who possess special training in applied psychology, and who 
are imbued with the problem-solving attitude, that is, the 
inclination to wrestle with problems, and to return to the 
work day by day as a problem calling for fresh analysis and 
progressive solution. In the second place, continuous case 
records must be kept and preserved in permanent files which 
should afford a fairly complete record of the child’s mental, 
moral, social, educational, and physical peculiarities, and the
-P-A-G-E-181
OBJECTIVES OF THE SPECIAL CLASS 168 
progress made in the various curricular activities offered in 
the special school. 
2. Differential instruction as a goal. The special class is 
designed to give the child special attention and individual in- 
struction. This aim is perhaps more frequently stressed 
than any other. In fact, these classes are frequently denomi- 
nated schools or classes for individual instruction. How- 
ever, such a designation expresses very imperfectly the real 
function of these classes, for the aim should be not merely to 
give the child more attention, more intensive instruction, or 
more drill in the regular program of studies, but to individ- 
ualize the instruction so that it will meet specific needs. In 
large measure the major problem may be defined as that of 
supplying a different course of study, or differential training, 
to meet the particular requirements of each registrant. 
Requirements for differential instruction. In order to 
realize this objective, it is essential that each child be prop- 
erly inventoried by the examining psychologist and the 
teacher with respect to personality make-up, especially so far 
as concerns his instinctive, emotional, social, volitional, 
motor, intellectual, and educational traits. The teacher 
must know what the child’s psychic assets and liabilities are 
before she can wisely plan a course of study that will meet 
the conditions and needs actually revealed in each pupil. 
The possibilities of group instruction. In thus emphasiz- 
ing the paramount necessity of supplying individual and 
differentiated instruction it is scarcely necessary to repeat 
that it does not follow that all special-class pupils must be 
taught singly in all branches, and that the instruction must 
be entirely sui generis for every pupil. Many children sub- 
ject to the same degree or type of defect, or who have reached 
the same level of proficiency in the work of the school, or 
who require approximately similar treatment, can be taught 
in groups, if not in all branches at all times, at least in some 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  164 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN . 
branches a part of the time. In general, the nearer the chil- 
dren are to normal the more nearly can the methods and pro- 
cedures of the regular grades be employed, while the greater 
the abnormality the more individual and differential must 
the work be, and the more aid and supervision will the chil- 
dren require. The brighter pupils may be given lesson as- 
signments for seat-work preparation and class recitation, 
particularly in spelling, reading, and the fundamental num- 
ber processes. Instruction may be given through the printed 
page, much as in the regular grade, although the emphasis 
should be placed on oral presentations for most of the men- 
tally defective. In using the methods of mass, class, or group 
instruction, however, the needs and interests of the individ- 
ual must not be sacrificed, or even subordinated, to the de- 
mands for routine, symmetry, and uniformity which go with 
the handling of groups — except in the classes in which the 
method of individual instruction has been introduced. 
Possible methods of grouping children for instruction. 
Various methods of grouping the children have been sug- 
gested. ; 
(1) According to intelligence age level. The method most 
frequently advocated is to group the children according to 
their “mental” or “intelligence” age level as determined by 
intelligence tests, particularly the Binet-Simon. Although 
this method has been urged as the exclusive basis for group- 
ing, its limitations are quite obvious. Children of the same 
intelligence level do not necessarily require the same educa- 
tional treatment. A twelve-year-old with a four-year men- , 
tality does not require the same treatment as a six-year- 
old with a four-year mentality, nor would they fit into 
the same group. Nor do children of the same intelligence 
level necessarily possess the same degree of proficiency in 
the different branches of the curriculum. Some will possess 
special weaknesses or special talents in some subjects, others
-P-A-G-E-183
  OBJECTIVES OF THE SPECIAL CLASS 165 
in other subjects. Some will be farther advanced educa- 
tionally because they have been in school longer or have 
applied themselves more diligently. The writer preserves 
a vivid recollection of a visit to a class of “defectives” 
grouped according to “mental age.” The group was ex- 
ceedingly disparate or conglomerate from the standpoint 
of chronological age (varying from nine to fifteen years), 
and educational attainments in reading and arithmetic 
(the two exercises observed). Although classified accord- 
ing to mental age there was a difference of two or three 
grades in the proficiency level of the pupils in these branches. 
(2) According to I.Q. A second method, advocated al- 
most as frequently, is to group the children according to their 
1.Q.’s — that is, according to their relative degree of bright- 
ness or potentials for future development. Attractive and 
valuable as is this method, it is subject to rigid limitations in 
practice. The chief weakness of the I.Q. is that it tells you 
little about the child’s mental or educational age. Children 
of the same I.Q. may differ very greatly in their intelligence 
level and stage of educational advancement. Thus an I.Q. 
of 50 would mean a mental age of three years for a six-year- 
old, of six years for a twelve-year-old, and of eight years for 
a sixteen-year-old. Children of such widely varied diag- 
noses,! mental age levels, and inequality of schooling could 
not be effectively grouped together for purposes of instruc- 
tion. 
(3) According to A.Q. In accordance with a more recent 
suggestion children should be grouped in the different 
branches according to their A.Q.’s (accomplishment quo- 
tients 2), which express their educational attainments in rela- 
1 According to the current standards the first two would be classified as 
imbeciles and the third as a moron. 
2 Obtained by dividing the child’s intelligence age into his educational 
age, as determined by standardized educational tests.
-P-A-G-E-184
  166 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
tion to their mental capacities, or indicate the quality of 
work which they may be reasonably expected to do. This 
criterion is of value provided the age scores in the intelligence 
and educational tests have been accurately standardized. 
We have seen children quite improperly classified, based on 
the work they were actually able to do in class, because too 
much confidence had been reposed on inaccurate test scores. 
(4) According to similarity of disability. A fourth method 
consists in grouping together children who suffer from sim- 
ilar handicaps, such as ocular or auditory defects, orthopedic 
disabilities, speech defects, and the like. The virtues of this 
method are quite obvious. 
In the author’s judgment, a satisfactory classification of a 
pupil for instruction must take into consideration his level 
of attainment in the various school branches at the time, his 
special educational abilities or disabilities, his intelligence 
level, I.Q. and A.Q. It is most important to guard against 
the tendency to make a fetish out of the intelligence level or 
1.Q. standards of classification. Children cannot be satis- 
factorily classified solely on the basis of the intelligence age 
or 1.Q. 
3. Happiness as an objective. A third function of the 
special class is to make the children contented, happy, op- 
timistic, and ambitious. It is known that agreeable feelings 
facilitate the normal functioning and augment the output of 
energy of the organism, while unpleasant experiences tend to 
inhibit the functions, depress the spirits, and devitalize the 
organism. The Training School at Vineland is a living em- 
bodiment of its famous motto: “Happiness first, all else fol- 
lows.” It is necessary to emphasize this objective in special- 
class work, because these children are at best unfortunate — 
always unfortunate in their mental limitations, which are 
frequently ineradicable, sometimes in their attitudes, often 
in the home treatment which they have received. Some
-P-A-G-E-185
  | OBJECTIVES OF THE SPECIAL CLASS 167 
have suffered neglect or abuse at the hands of the parents or 
siblings. Some have even been debauched in the home. 
Many have frequently been unfortunate in their contacts 
with other children, and in their experiences in the grades, 
where they have become discouraged by the fruitless attempt 
to master incomprehensible subject-matter. 
The special class asarealhome. The special class should 
be a real home, arranged so far as possible like a real home, 
which will let sunshine into the souls of the pupils who may 
have grown sullen, ill-tempered, pessimistic, cynical, am- 
bitionless, and who have lost their grip on life. The special 
class must give such children a new vision and outlook upon 
life. The teacher of these classes must in very truth stand 
in the relationship of locus parentis to the children. She 
must be a mother (or at least a godmother) to them, actu- 
ated by the sympathy and unselfish devotion of the real 
mother. If she is a real teacher, she will be the best mother 
many of these children have ever had. 
Healthy vs. morbid sympathy. However, in attempting 
to achieve this important aim, the teacher must guard against 
the tendency to become morbidly sympathetic. If she per- 
mits herself to brood over the children’s misfortunes, her 
sympathy may become pathological and lead to introspec- 
tion, introversion, morbidity, dejection, and inaction. There 
is no place for this kind of sympathy. The teacher needs the 
type of sane, robust, balanced sympathy which will stimu- 
late her to exert her best efforts in behalf of underprivileged 
children. : 
No doubt this objective is sometimes given exaggerated 
importance. There may be teachers who conceive their sole 
function in the special class to be that of “mothering” the 
children and making them happy. Hence it is necessary to 
emphasize two further aims which are of cardinal importance. 
4. Utility as a major objective of special-class training.
-P-A-G-E-186
168 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
The special class must aim so to train the pupils that they 
will become maximally self-supporting, or as slight a bur- 
den to society as possible. Therefore the controlling prin- 
ciple in the organization of the program must be the prac- 
tical utility of the subject-matter taught. The dominant 
emphasis must be placed on the practical, utilitarian, or vo- 
cational, rather than on the cultural or academic objectives. 
Because of the fact that the training of mentally inefficient 
children requires a heavy financial outlay by the schools, 
and because the care, control, and support of the feeble- 
minded impose, even under favorable conditions, a heavy 
burden on society, the paramount duty of the schools is to 
maximally increase the children’s productive efficiency, so 
that they will, so far as possible, carry their own weight, and 
so that they will not gravitate to the ranks of the vagabonds, 
paupers, dependents, and delinquents. The special classes 
must set themselves resolutely to the task of stemming, so 
far as possible, the swelling tide of social and industrial in- 
competency, inadequacy, criminality, and degeneracy. The 
processes of educational reconstruction, while they cannot 
produce miracles, will overcome delinquent tendencies and 
develop sufficient competency for self-support in many sub- 
normals, of which more in the latter part of the chapter. 
How to accomplish the utilitarian objective. How can 
this basic objective of special-class work be practically 
achieved in highest measure? In two ways: 
(1) By supplying sensori-motor, manumental, industrial, 
and vocational training which will not only develop manual 
dexterity, muscular skill, skill in the control of material 
forces, and in the manipulation of mechanical or industrial 
processes, but which will also develop intelligence and judg- 
ment in dealing with such processes, and with the civic, in- 
dustrial, and economic problems of the workaday world. 
The training should develop brain power no less than hand
-P-A-G-E-187
OBJECTIVES OF THE SPECIAL CLASS 169 
power. It should develop thinking by doing. Ideally the 
special classes, especially the shop classes for high-grade 
children, should aim to develop specific vocational skills 
through definite and varied trade and craft training. 
Difficulties of supplying trade training. But the difficul- 
ties of realizing this objective are almost insuperable. It is 
far easier and much less costly to supply a rich curriculum of 
developmental or educative manumental and industrial arts 
training than to supply training in definite trades or crafts 
which will prepare the child for a definite job when he leaves 
school, and which will be certain to “carry over” into his 
after-school occupations. 
The difficulty of supplying vocational training which will 
“carry over” may be illustrated by citing the situation re- 
specting two of the most representative industrial activities 
conducted in the special classes throughout the country, 
namely woodwork and basketry. 
Woodwork. Woodwork possesses high value from the 
standpoint of the ease with which wood can be modified or 
manipulated or transformed into a great variety of objects, 
from the standpoint of the motor and muscular develop- 
ment afforded from working in wood, and from the stand- 
point of the practical utility of the objects made. The ob- 
jects made can be put to practical use in the school and in 
the home. Woodwork performs excellent service in supply- 
ing vital cores or projects around which to correlate much of 
the literary instruction. Most deficient children highly en- 
joy working in wood, and many acquire very considerable 
skill in the handling of the tools and in the manufacture of 
objects. Nevertheless very few will be employed in wood- 
work after they leave school. Very few become carpenters 
or cabinetmakers. In tracing the records of 1969 children ! 
1 Not all of these children were feeble-minded. The history of 436 was 
unobtainable. Four hundred were still in the special schools.
-P-A-G-E-188
  170 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
who had been enrolled in the St. Louis Special Schools for 
Individual Instruction during a period of twelve and a half 
years (68.5 per cent of whom were boys), I found that only 
one was reported to be a carpenter and only two painters 
(although others probably had followed these trades at one 
time). Obviously it would not be advisable to train these 
children specifically for carpentry since practically no one 
becomes a carpenter, although the value of training defec- 
tives in woodwork is unquestionable. 
Basketry. Weaving in reed and raffia, and particularly 
making baskets, constitutes perhaps the most prevalent 
type of handwork offered in the special classes, for reasons 
not difficult to find. This work offers a very wide range of 
application. Low-grade pupils and beginners can be started 
on very simple raffia and reed objects (such as table mats), 
while the older and higher grade pupils can continue to work 
at more complicated and elaborate objects for years. Weay- 
ing in reed and raffia is a capital activity up to a certain point 
for developing the strength and codrdination of the fingers. 
As a form of busy work it is, from one point of view, unex- 
celled. The work is so slow that the pupil can be kept em- 
ployed for weeks or months on the same basket, thus reliev- 
ing the teacher from much planning or supervision of the 
seat work. Perhaps this is the chief reason for its extensive 
employment, as it is also the chief reason for the futility of 
much reed and raffia work. Inattentive, automatic, sloy- 
enly repetition of the same weaving movements day in and 
day out, the type of seat work sometimes observed, is stupe- 
fying and without educational value. Unless there is planned 
progress and sufficient diversification to create genuine 
problematic situations, basketry may become a. prolific 
source of wasted'effort. It is justifiable as an educational — 
exercise only so long as it makes for the development of 
power, skill, and appreciation of artistic or useful products.
-P-A-G-E-189
  OBJECTIVES OF THE SPECIAL CLASS 171 
But, although the objects made possess considerable intrin- 
sic value, the value of basketry in preparing the children for 
a specific occupation is slight, for apparently very few chil- 
dren leaving the special schools engage in work with reed or 
raffia. Only one of the St. Louis ex-special school children 
investigated was employed in a basket factory. Appar- 
ently reed work does not develop a form of skill which will be 
directly applied after school. - 
Basis for the selection of types of utilitarian training. Ideally, 
in planning the program of practical training in the special 
schools, we should go out into the community and find out 
what the community wants, then train the pupils for the spe- 
cific types of service required in the locality where the chil- 
dren reside. What kinds of jobs or trades does the com- 
munity offer? What jobs are suitable for subnormals? 
What standards of skill are demanded for each kind of job? 
How are workmen most efficiently trained in the industries 
for different occupations? But, based on the findings in our 
St. Louis survey, it would be well nigh impossible to put this 
ideal into practical effect. The amazing thing revealed in 
this survey was the great variety of occupations which the 
ex-pupils entered, and the difficulty of finding any “‘typi- 
cal” jobs which they were following and for which they 
should be trained. 
Occupational pursuits of ex-special-class pupils. The most fre- 
quent occupations among the boys were: driving wagons or auto- 
mobiles (29 instances), working in shoe (17), box (12), and stove 
(8) factories, selling newspapers (10) or delivering telegraph mes- 
sages (8), and working in grocery stores (8) or bakeries (5). 
Twelve were in the army and five in the navy. Some were errand, 
delivery, or bell boys, car-track repairers, or fruit vendors. 
Others were employed in drug stores, butcher shops, vegetable 
commission houses, saloons or breweries, picture shows, tailor 
shops, stone yards, car shops, foundries, or factories, including 
barrel, screw, buggy, shovel, basket, bag, hemp, furniture, trunk,
-P-A-G-E-190
  172 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
coffin, pipe, soap, macaroni, shirt, and tile factories. Of the girls, 
there were five each employed as maids, or workers in stores or 
tobacco factories, Others were employed in.drug and candy stores, 
restaurants, millinery shops, hair-dressing parlors, dyeing estab- 
lishments, laundries, printeries, shirt factories, or tailoring estab- 
lishments. A much larger proportion of girls than boys were em- 
ployed in some capacity at home. 
It is perfectly obvious that the schools could not attempt 
to train pupils for all these occupations, or even a fraction 
of them; nor do the findings indicate unambiguously the 
trades which could be most successfully taught in the school. 
Aim to approximate vocational ideal. While, therefore, 
the chief aim must be to supply a considerable variety of 
basic developmental hand, prevocational, or industrial arts 
training in all the special schools, it is well to approximate 
so far as practicable the ideals of semi-craft or semi-trade 
training, or even limited vocational training for the older 
higher grade cases, especially in the shop or vocational cen- 
ters or in part-time continuation centers. There is one way 
in which training for life may be given in a very practical 
way in the special schools, and that is to have the pupils do 
things which have a direct utilitarian value at the time. 
Let them mend their wearing apparel, repair their shoes, re- 
pair school furniture, make school furniture, furnishings, 
supplies, didactic materials, bandages, or towels, prepare 
and serve daily lunches in the school, wash the school dishes, 
cabinets, and towels, take their turn at laundering and scrub- 
bing, and so on. 
It may not be superfluous to suggest that use be made of 
the regular manual training and domestic economy centers 
when the special classes are without proper equipment, al- 
though such an arrangement usually precludes effective cor- 
relation of the hand training with the literary instruction 
offered in the special school.
-P-A-G-E-191

OBJECTIVES OF THE SPECIAL CLASS 173 
(2) The second: way in which to realize the basic utilita- 
rian objective, @r to make the training “carry over,” is to 
institute a system of vocational guidance or after-care, par- 
ticularly so far as concerns the children who must go to work 
when they leave the special classes and those who are not 
properly supported, protected, or controlled. This service is 
needed for the purpose of saving as many children as pos- 
sible from failure, and for the purpose of gathering reliable 
data bearing on the benefits received from the school train- 
ing, on the degree of practical success achieved by different 
grades of deficients, and on the best methods of dealing with 
these children in the future, both in and out of school. 
What vocational guidance involves. A reasonably com- 
prehensive system of vocational investigation and aid would 
include the following lines of endeavor: 
(1) Investigation of the individual’s personality make-up, 
vocational aptitudes, inclinations, and contraindications. The 
aim should be to discover, largely from a scrutiny of the 
analytical reports already mentioned, the particular crafts 
or occupations for which the children are peculiarly adapted 
or unadapted physically and mentally, and any special in- 
clinations and talents. It is important to determine whether 
there are any occupations which are especially contrain- 
dicated because of violent antipathies, or definite physical de- 
fects, or predisposition toward certain diseases. Obviously, 
certain occupations would be disastrous for a child with a 
tubercular diathesis, or with heart disease, or serious impair- 
ment of vision or hearing. It is similarly important to de- 
termine whether the child has the requisite intelligence and 
mechanical skill required in various occupations, but it is 
even more important to determine whether he has an incli- 
nation for the work. To force a child into types of employ- 
ment which he abhors is to court failure, no matter how cap- 
able he may be. We shall reap the best results when we try
-P-A-G-E-192
ee ee re ee 
/ 
174 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
to discover the child’s special predilections and talents, then 
fit him for types of work which he wants to do, and finally 
place him in such work. Not one whit less important for 
scientific vocational guidance is the inventory of the child’s 
emotional, temperamental, and instinctive peculiarities, 
which intimately condition an individual’s industrial and 
social efficiency. The unstable child, even when possessed 
of good or fair intelligence, has a passion for change, variety, 
novelty. He is chronically dissatisfied with his old job. It 
is “too hard,” “‘too unremunerative,” “the hours are too 
long,” or “the boss or his fellow workers are not agreeable.” 
Hence he is frequently looking for another job, for a genuine 
snap, for a bed of roses, which he rarely finds. Because of 
his shiftlessness and instability, he readily acquires anti- 
social attitudes, and easily drifts into criminal modes of be- 
havior, while he is sometimes aggressively criminalistically 
inclined. On the other hand, even mentally defective chil- 
dren of medium grade who are not subject to emotional or 
nervous instabilities, but are stable and trustworthy — and 
there are many such — are capable of sustained application 
and may be expected to hold a routine position for a long 
time. It is of paramount importance to consider the child’s 
emotional and temperamental make-up in programs of sci- 
entific vocational guidance. 
(2) The making of an inventory or vocational survey of the 
positions available for mental deficients in the community. 
This should include the listing of the positions which come 
within their limited range of vocational skill and general abil- 
ity and interest, the initial rewards of each job, the rate of 
advancement, the steadiness of employment, the ultimate 
effects of the employment upon the worker, physically, men- 
tally, and morally, and the moral hazards of the environ- 
ment to which the child will be exposed. It is not suggested 
that subnormals should be shielded from drudgery, and from
-P-A-G-E-193
  OBJECTIVES OF THE SPECIAL CLASS 175 
all forms of disagreeable labor. Some one must do the more 
dreary and less desirable work of the world. Industry and 
society as now organized would survive with difficulty with- 
out armies of mediocrities to do the simple, routine, mono- 
tonous, blind-alley work of the world. Fortunately, mental 
defectives are not averse to work of a routine nature. This 
is the type of work in which they excel, because of their abil- 
ity to form habits of high degree of dependability in simple 
routine situations. It is, however, vital to suggest a slightly 
different consideration, namely that children who are highly 
suggestible and easily dominated and led astray should not 
be placed in environments in which they will be subjected to 
moral and economic exploitation. 
(3) The conducting of a placement or employment agency, 
charged with the responsibility of finding situations suited 
to the interests and capabilities of the applicants. This is 
all that some “vocational guidance bureaus” attempt. 
(4) Follow-up aid and investigation. The purpose of the 
after-school service (which can be rendered by visiting or 
special-class teachers, social workers, attendance or parole 
officers, or volunteer welfare workers) is to aid and encour- 
age the children, build up their morale when they are failing, 
find new positions for them when necessary, safeguard them 
from temptation, exploitation, and criminalistic careers, ad- 
vise them regarding the conservation of their earnings, and 
their physical and moral health, and regarding their social 
obligations, confer with employers concerning their welfare, 
and advise the parents concerning measures which need to 
be taken for the child’s future social and economic welfare, 
which, in many cases, will mean custodial care or coloniza- 
tion. ‘These vocational aides, however, must assume the 
réle of friendly personal and vocational counselors, always 
willing to act as unselfish intermediaries between the child 
and the parents, on the one hand, and between the child and
-P-A-G-E-194
  176 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
the employer, on the other hand. In spite of its cost this 
type of service is an economic measure. It will prevent 
much inefficiency, pauperism, and crime, and enable many 
deficients to lead a happy, useful, and economically inde- 
pendent existence, as has been abundantly demonstrated in 
the case of defectives paroled from institutions or leaving 
public school special classes. 
The Detroit plan may be commended because it enables 
the teacher to bring to bear an impelling incentive on the 
child to “make good” at his job. At about the age of fifteen 
the child is placed in a position on part-time. If “fired” 
because of negligence or inefficiency, he is obliged to attend 
school on full time until it seems expedient to give him an- 
other trial. Under such a plan it is possible to discover the 
children’s specific weaknesses and supply definite corrective 
training. 
There is, however, another objective of special-class work 
perhaps as important as that of training the children to be- 
come maximally self-supporting, namely: 
5. The training of the pupils to become self-respecting, 
law-abiding, altruistic, efficient companions and citizens. 
The special schools must strive, perhaps even more earnestly 
than the regular schools, to devleop good, loyal, patriotic 
citizens. Mental inferiors are peculiarly in need of instruc- 
tion and practical training in the fundamental personal, so- 
cial, and civic virtues. They are frequently conspicuously 
deficient in the traits that lie at the base of a healthy social 
or civic consciousness, in an understanding of the ideals on 
which a successful democracy must be based, in the feelings 
of respect for law and order and the rights and prerogatives 
of other people, in the appreciation of their duties to others 
and to themselves as self-respecting individuals, in the ideals 
of personal honor, and in the sentiments of patriotic devo- 
tion and the feelings of obligation and willing submission  
-P-A-G-E-195
    OBJECTIVES OF THE SPECIAL CLASS 7 
which they should harbor to the State, which to them often 
represents a meaningless entity or barren abstraction. Not 
only must we attempt to develop proper ideals, sentiments, 
and modes of response with respect to the social and civic 
relations of life, but we must develop habits of industry, 
good craftsmanship, and thrift, and a desire to be helpful, 
to contribute a just share to the common weal, to be four- 
square in business relations or vocational pursuits, and to 
render a dollar’s worth of service for a dollar’s worth of pay. 
One of the tragedies of the age is the widespread contempt 
for honest toil and the desire to escape work, which will tend 
insidiously to undermine the musculature and lay the foun- 
dation for racial deterioration. 
Ultimate ideals of all special-class work. The correction 
of personality defects, the development of voluntary con- 
trols and inhibitions of anti-social proclivities, the inculca- 
tion of ideals, the strengthening of the individual’s morale, 
the “building of character,” the establishment of desirable 
personal, social, and industrial habits and attitudes, the de- 
velopment of the highest possible degree of vocational effi- 
ciency and the desire to be of service, are ultimate objectives 
of all special-class work, and all systems of instruction which 
minimize or ignore these objectives are one-sided, imperfect, 
and pernicious, and should be relegated to the scrap-heap of 
oblivion. Those special-class teachers have “measured up 
to their jobs” and have rendered a signal service to society, 
for which they are deserving of unstinted commendation, 
who have so trained the pupils that they will become maxi- 
mally self-supporting, self-directing, and_ self-respecting 
members of society or of special communities or colonies 
which have been established for their benefit. 
Results of moral and industrial training. Fortunately 
the large majority of subnormals are tractable, amenable to 
training, and capable of forming desirable and dependable
-P-A-G-E-196
SN Te ee Te Te eT TE EE RMT ee ee 
178 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
habits of response, socially, industrially, and morally, and of 
becoming partially or almost wholly self-supporting. 
It is possible so to train many of the feeble-minded that 
they will be able to distinguish between right and wrong so 
far as concerns the ordinary virtues and relations of life. It 
is even possible to develop socially acceptable behavior in 
some mental defectives, especially of the stable type, who 
are incapable of clearly comprehending the social and ethi- 
cal relations involved, or of foreseeing the ultimate conse- 
quences of their acts. It is possible to train mental defec- 
tives toinhibit theirnatural or instinctive anti-social prompt- 
ings or criminalistic proclivities; to control and stabilize 
their temperamental, emotional, and impulsive tenden- 
cies; to substitute desirable for undesirable responses; to 
strengthen good tendencies; and to build up fairly reliable 
desirable habit patterns. 
Evidences from St. Louis investigation. The truth of 
these statements may be shown from our investigation of the 
1969 pupils who had been enrolled in the St. Louis special 
schools during a period of twelve and a half years. Only one 
boy had been accused of murder, and he was freed because 
of lack of evidence. Only 3.3 per cent of these pupils had 
been committed to an institution because of conduct dis- 
orders. The true number was somewhat larger, as no in- 
formation could be obtained for 436 pupils. However, dur- 
ing a six-year period in which the reasons for the withdrawal 
of pupils from the special schools were accurately reported 
to the writer, only four per cent (of 566 withdrawals) were 
withdrawn because they were committed to an institution 
on account of misconduct. Of the 186 children examined by 
representatives of the National Committee for Mental Hy- 
giene in the St. Louis industrial school for delinquent boys, 
only four had been registered in the St. Louis special schools, 
and of these only two were pronounced feeble-minded by 
the examiner (T. H. Haines).
-P-A-G-E-197
OBJECTIVES OF THE SPECIAL CLASS 179 
Many of the children were persistent truants in the grade 
schools, but only 4.5 per cent (36) of 787 enrolled in the spe- 
cial schools during a three-year period had been truant at 
any time. The special school régime kept them in school, al- 
though not all, of course, responded. One boy had been 
truant 113 days, one 65 days, one 46, one 40, and one 27 
days. These five were responsible for 291 of the 408 days of 
truancy. Some of these pupils corresponded to the classi- 
cal type of unstable, excitable, truant, irresponsible mental 
defective. 
According to the estimates submitted by the special school 
teachers, only 16.5 per cent of the 1969 ought to be com- 
mitted to a State colony because of lack of intelligence, crim- 
inalistic proclivities, or inadequate home care. The num- 
ber judged to be in need of institutional restraint because of 
criminalistic or delinquent tendencies amounted to not 
quite three per cent. 
Our findings with respect to the small proportion of men- 
tally defective children who were aggressively criminalisti- 
cally inclined coincides with the estimates made by vari- 
ous authorities (see page 350). Of course, these figures are 
larger than the ratios which would be found among the chil- 
dren in the regular grades, but they are very small compared 
with the claims put forth repeatedly during the last decade 
and a half, namely that all mental defectives are potential 
criminals or are criminally inclined and that, in point of fact, 
most delinquents and criminals are mentally defective. 
It was impossible to obtain an accurate detailed industrial 
record of all the children who had left the specials, or the 
wages which all of them were receiving at the time of the 
investigation. Many were self-supporting (but backward 
children had been admitted to the schools, particularly dur- 
ing the early days), and most of the others partially self-sup- 
porting. The teachers estimated that about seven per cent
-P-A-G-E-198
180 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
of 374 in the schools at the time would become wholly self- 
supporting, 17.6 per cent three quarters supporting, 27.8 
per cent half supporting, 27.2 per cent one quarter support- 
ing, and 20.3 per cent totally dependent. The estimates 
were based on ability plus personality make-up. Individual 
studies made by the writer and others show that ex-special- 
school children with a mentality of nine or above have ac- 
quired enough capacity to make a living at some useful form 
of labor if temperamentally stable and properly environed. 
A not inconsiderable portion of these favorable results is 
due to the effectiveness of the special-class regimen in hold- 
ing the children in school, in regularizing their instinctive 
and emotional tendencies, in developing habits of acceptable 
conduct reaction, thrift, industry, hand skill, and skill in 
various vocations, in instilling proper moral and social ideals, 
in forming ideals of efficient craftsmanship, and in develop- 
ing proper morale and esprit de corps. 
Illustrative cases. We could cite many instances from our 
files showing how obstreperous children will respond to in- 
telligent treatment and adaptable training. Two must 
suffice: 
M. W., who came to the clinic at the age of 12.4 (Binet age 10, by 
the 1908 scale, I.Q. 82), was very unstable nervously, and suffered 
from an excruciating form of stuttering which threw his face into 
violent contortions and engorged the blood vessels when he at- 
tempted to speak. He had been excluded from school previously 
and was about to be excluded again for misconduct. According to 
the school report he was “very disobedient, he refuses to do his 
work, he disturbs the children around him, fights with the other 
children in the hall, takes things from them, has no respect for au- 
thority and uses the dirtiest and ugliest language in school and on 
the grounds. He is the embodiment of meanness.” He was as- 
signed to a special class with recommendations regarding his liter- 
ary and industrial training, social and moral care, and the man- 
agement of his stuttering. The genial atmosphere of the special 
class produced a well-nigh miraculous transformation. After six
-P-A-G-E-199
OBJECTIVES OF THE SPECIAL CLASS 181 
months the teacher reported that he was “doing well, he has shown 
no disobedience, no vulgarity, and no outbursts.” ‘Ten months 
later the report stated that “the teachers have been surprised at 
his good behavior. He is contented, polite, cheerful, and only once 
has he used bad language.” He was one of the most enterprising 
and successful newsboys I have known. 
R. J. was reported as “habitually truant and incorrigible. He 
chews, smokes, and drinks. He is constantly in some kind of 
trouble in the room.” At the age of 12.3 he had a Binet age of 8.4; 
1.Q. 68.3. He was assigned to a special school where he could be 
given work he was capable of doing. Five months later the teacher 
reported that “his attendance is very regular, attitude good, be- 
havior good, although he has occasional fits of temper. He has im- 
proved wonderfully in reading and cleanliness.” 
The schools’ responsibility in the prevention of delin- 
quency. It is undoubtedly true that the schools themselves 
are responsible for much truancy and delinquency by at- 
tempting to force children to do work which they cannot do. 
This fosters a spirit of rebellion against the school and causes 
the children to become truant and delinquent, for truancy 
often leads to delinquency. In this direction the schools can 
do real preventive work, for they can prevent much truancy 
and delinquency by properly adapting the instruction to 
meet the needs of the children. The juvenile courts and re- 
formatories get the children only after they have embarked 
on their career of delinquency. It is easier to prevent chil- 
dren from embarking on such careers than to reform them 
after they have already become delinquent. 
The social and moral outlook for the well-trained ex- 
special school defective would not be altogether disap- 
pointing if the children were properly assisted and safe- 
guarded after leaving school. The situation is not quite so 
black as it has been depicted during the last fifteen years.

  CHAPTER VIII 
CONDITIONS ON WHICH THE EFFICIENCY OF THE 
INSTRUCTION FOR THE MENTALLY DEFICIENT 
DEPENDS 
Tue successful organization of developmental and recon- 
structive work for subnormals in the schools depends not 
only on certain important conditions to which we have al- 
ready alluded, such as the removal of physical impediments, 
the adequate differentiation or classification of the pupils, 
the development of an adequate scheme of classes, divisions, 
or individual aid, and the explicit recognition of certain fun- 
damental objectives to be attained, but it also depends to a 
very considerable extent on supplying certain teaching con- 
ditions on which the quality of the instruction depends more 
or less intimately and directly. The next two chapters will 
be devoted to the discussion of some of the more important 
technical didactic requirements which will insure efficient 
instruction for deficient, dull, and backward children. 
1. Size of the class. One of the conditions most fre- 
quently stressed for successful special-class work is that the 
class enrollment must be small. In practice the registration 
in classes for the mentally defective or deficient varies from 
8 or 9 to 20 or 25 in different countries and in different cities. 
The enrollment in the ungraded classes in New York City in 
1916 varied as follows: 49 classes from 20 to 24 pupils; 155 
classes from 15 to 19; and 8 from 10 to 14 pupils. 
The writer’s investigation of the practice in American 
cities in 1913 revealed that the established enrollment (from 
which variations were, no doubt, made without compunc- 
tion) was 15 pupils per class in 42 cities, 20 in 9, 12 in 6, 10
-P-A-G-E-203
  EFFICIENCY OF INSTRUCTION 185 
- in 3, 15 or less in 67 and 20 or less in 92 cities. In only 5 
cities did the enrollment exceed 20. In New Jersey, New 
York, and Massachusetts, the classes are limited by lawto 15. 
Maennel recommends as acceptable standards 15 for the 
lower grades, 20 for the intermediate grades, and 25 for the 
higher grades, but it is not certain that he is referring only to 
mentally defective children. On the other hand, there are 
those who insist that there should be not more than four or 
five mentally defective children (as well as blind and deaf 
children) per teacher, while some private schools boast of 
the fact that each teacher handles only one or two pupils. 
The argument advanced in support of such rigid restric- 
tions is that the teacher will be able to give the pupils more 
attention, aid, instruction, drill, encouragement, stimula- 
tion, and supervision, and therefore, the pupil will make 
more rapid and far greater progress. 
Objections to small classes. Against the small classes, 
however, three serious objections may be urged: 
Small classes too costly. The first is that it is too expensive 
to provide four or five defectives, who at best can never be 
trained to become leaders or to occupy responsible positions, 
with the most expensive form of instruction and educational 
equipment, and high-salaried teachers. Our chief obliga- 
tion, it is argued, is to the normal, bright, hopeful, or only 
slightly retarded pupils. This objection is well-grounded, 
but only so far as it relates to the very small classes, for it 
must be emphasized anew that in segregating the mentally 
deficient children, the holdbacks, we are facilitating the 
progress in the regular grades of the normal and bright 
pupils. 
Diminishing educational returns from oversaturation. It 
may be objected, in the second place, that the very small 
class is not educationally justifiable. The idea that an 
enormous amount of drill and intensive instruction will im-
-P-A-G-E-204
186 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
prove mental defectives very much more than a reasonable 
amount of training, is erroneous. This was shown in an in- 
vestigation in which standardized educational tests were 
given to the pupils from a private school with one teacher to 
each pupil and the pupils in the Massachusetts School for 
the Feeble-Minded averaging about twenty pupils to the 
teacher. The pupils from the private school did no better 
than the pupils from the State institution when those of the 
same intelligence ages were compared. Let us not forget 
that mentally deficient children can be surfeited by too much 
instruction. After they have reached the saturation point 
and cannot hold much more, you get less for your expendi- 
ture of labor. A safe principle to follow is to give children 
instruction and drill up to the point of their capacity to ac- 
quire in any subject. After that you get diminishing re- 
turns for your efforts. You cannot work miracles in the at- 
tempt to advance the educational or industrial status of 
mental defectives, or of any other type of defectives, by 
oversaturating them with drill and instruction. It takes 
the mentally defective more than the usual amount of time 
to acquire and digest, and to form habits. Stopping-places 
or resting-plateaus may even be necessary to enable the 
growing child to get his “second wind,” or get his “hier- 
archy of habits” established for a fresh advance. 
Positive advantages from numerous contacts. A further ob- 
jection to wholly limiting instruction to very small groups, 
or to teaching pupils singly, is that children derive consid- 
erable benefit, socially and educationally, from the reciprocal 
give-and-take, from the social and intellectual interactions, 
and from the stimulation and interest which are aroused in 
properly conducted class exercises. The codperative activ- 
ities of a large group tend to excite more verve and enthusi- 
asm, afford more personal contacts, establish a finer spirit of 
esprit de corps, more nearly approximate the team work in 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
  EFFICIENCY OF INSTRUCTION 187 
practical life situations, and are thus more genuinely social- 
izing than the activities of a very small group. Children 
may learn the lessons of practical life better from contact 
with numerous playfellows or team mates than from one or 
two elder mentors. 
Suggested enrollment. The number of pupils who can be 
taught in a class (in which the instruction has not been de- 
partmentalized) with a reasonable degree of success will 
vary according to the gravity of the deficiency of the chil- 
dren, according to the homogeneity of the group, and the 
nature of the subject-matter taught. The teaching of a 
group of twenty evenly graded defectives would be no more 
difficult, nor heavier from the standpoint of the teaching 
load, than the instruction of fifteen defectives of all grades. 
As reasonable standards for the public schools may be 
suggested a registration of from fifteen to eighteen in classes 
for the mentally deficient, and from eighteen to twenty-five 
in classes for the borderline and seriously backward, ac- 
cording to the degree of homogeneity of the class. For the 
classes as ordinarily constituted, we might fix the maximal 
enrollment for the former type at sixteen or seventeen, and 
for the latter at twenty-one or twenty-two. Groups of this 
size can be taught with a reasonable degree of efficiency, 
particularly if the seat-work is effectively planned and if 
some of the brightest pupils are trained to assist in the hand- 
ling of some of the low grades. 
2. Freedom in adapting instruction. A larger amount of 
freedom must be accorded the teachers of classes for both 
the mentally deficient and the backward than is usually 
countenanced in the regular grades so far as concerns the 
arrangements of the details of the program, the time for 
scheduling the various branches, the length of the periods, 
the degree of proficiency required before a child may be ad- 
vanced, the dropping of studies, the substitution of new 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
188 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
types of work, etc. While there must be freedom from the 
lockstep, routine, mass’procedure, formality, and relatively 
fixed requirements of the regular grades, this does not imply 
that the special-class teacher should not follow any program 
at all, or a planless, purposeless, haphazard program, as wil! 
be emphasized on a later page. 
3. Methods of instruction. Use must be made of effective, 
adaptable teaching methods and devices; that is, methods 
and devices which tend to correct defects as well as to de- 
velop the child’s mental and physical powers and functions. 
The work should be based upon a scientific system of “occu- 
pational therapy,” “corrective pedagogy,” “orthosomatics,” 
or “orthophrenics,” which involves not only the employ- 
ment of effective methods of teaching, but also appropriate 
materials of instruction. We shall at this point consider 
somewhat in detail certain important principles of teaching 
in relation to the education of subnormals. 
Remarks on Teacuine Metuops 
1. Adaptation of methods to individual requirements. It 
would seem wholly superfluous to say that the methods and 
devices must be adapted to the child’s mental and educa- 
tional level and to his special abilities and disabilities. The 
principle has become a trite truism through repeated reém- 
phasis in the educational literature, and yet it would not be 
necessary to search very long to find evidence that this rule 
is habitually violated. For example, the same contents, de- 
vices, and methods of teaching reading are often used with- 
out modification with low-grade and high-grade cases, with 
normal and word-blind cases. And yet experience has 
shown that the ordinary methods, good as they may be for 
normal pupils, are not always effective with abnormals. To 
reach the individual you often must break away from the 
stock methods and apply methods which are particularly 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
EFFICIENCY OF INSTRUCTION 189 
adapted to overcoming a particular child’s defects. The 
alphabetic method of teaching reading, long ago discarded as 
archaic, will be found superior with some cases to the re- 
vered phonic, word, or sentence methods. When the child’s 
special difficulties have been discovered, a mere change of 
method may produce remarkable results in apparently hope- 
less cases. Grace M. Fernald and Helen Keller have given 
instances of the remarkable progress made by non-readers 
when a method was applied which made extensive use of 
kinesthetic imagery. Augusta Bronner cites the case of a 
boy with defective powers of audition, but with good visual 
powers, who was placed in a class for backward children be- 
cause of his inability to do number work which was taught 
by the oral method. His parents, knowing of his powers of 
visualization, took him in hand and taught him by visual 
presentations. In two weeks he led his class, and in two 
years finished four years’ work. 
The sine qua non of remedial pedagogy. Effective re- 
medial or corrective methods will not automatically apply 
themselves. To get maximal results the classes must be in 
charge of diagnostic teachers who will analyze the nature of 
the children’s disabilities and adjust the processes and con- 
tents of instruction to meet their specific needs. Of this 
more in the next chapter. 
Granting that low-grade children require more drill, more 
formal work, more individuation or differentiation, it may 
yet be questioned whether it is financially justifiable to give 
these children the advantages of highly individualized in- 
struction. The following may be recommended as a con- 
servative principle for deciding the merits of such cases: 
When it becomes evident that a low-grade child is incapable 
of making any considerable advancement, he should be ex- 
cluded from school or retained for simple occupational train- 
ing, and for the development of desirable personal attitudes 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
199 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
and habits. This training can be partly given by older 
pupils working under the teacher’s supervision. Their care 
need not consume much of the teacher’s time. Certainly 
these children are far better off in school than in some homes 
or on the streets, where they may get into serious social com- 
plications. : I 
2. Types of teaching exercises and justification of drill. 
All the well-recognized types of teaching exercises or proc- 
esses have a place in the special schools. These teaching 
processes include: (a) Testing exercises, the purpose of which 
is to find out what the child has already acquired in school or 
out of school, and to what extent he has mastered a partic- 
ular assignment. (b) Reviews, oral or written, or the testing 
of a series of lessons or exercises, for the purpose of reviving 
past experiences, connecting up various lessons, securing a 
more comprehensive grasp of the subject, increasing the 
number of associations, and fixing facts and relations in 
memory. (c) Drills, for the purpose of developing skill and 
fixing what has been acquired, either by formal repetitions 
(drills), or by applying the same processes to the solution of 
new problems. (d) Teaching in the narrow sense, which in- 
cludes the imparting of information, the developing of 
knowledge, and the training of the child to discover facts and 
to solve problems for himself, and to develop the technique 
necessary for making such discoveries and solutions. In 
teaching, use is made of books, lectures, talks, discussions, 
questions, topics, outlines, drawings, pictures, models, maps, 
exercises, experiments, demonstrations, practicums, the 
solution of problematic situations, projects, and codperative 
learning on the part of the pupils (a mode of procedure 
usually referred to as the “socialized recitation”). 
Mental deficients in need of more instruction and drill. 
The use of some of these teaching processes will be discussed 
in later sections. At this point we pause merely to say that 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  EFFICIENCY OF INSTRUCTION 191 
many facts must be taught mental deficients that need not 
be taught at all to normal children, because they acquire 
them incidentally. Moreover, many facts can be fixed in 
mental deficients only by repeated drills which the normal 
children will retain from one presentation. Far more drill, 
repetition, and formal work are needed with the deficient and 
backward than with the normal and bright. But this fact is 
not without consolation, for we know that formal work and 
drill are effective with defectives, whatever the explanation 
— whether the formal drills develop the functions or increase 
the capacities (such as memory or attention), or merely form 
general habits of study, application, or attention, or merely 
develop a mental technique which will prove useful in varied 
situations, or merely remove obstacles to economic mem- 
orizing, attending, or developing various skills. It is gener- 
ally agreed that training, whether formal or informal, fa- 
cilitates the effective use of the mental powers which have 
been exercised. It makes the pathways of discharge more 
permeable. 
Need of vitalized drill technique. It goes without saying 
that the teacher should make the formal exercises and drills 
as interesting, vital, and dynamic as possible, no less with 
defectives than with normals. They should be “sugar- 
coated” by the use of games, by the introduction of the 
playful element’ and the element of contest, by the use of 
rhythm, and by appeal to instinctive interests and natural 
incentives. Moreover, formal drill processes should be 
freely supplemented by the methods of incidental instruc- 
tion and by problem and project work. 
3. Method of development. Use should be made of the 
so-called developmental or heuristic method. Its vital pre- 
cepts are: do not tell the child everything he does not know; 
do not show him everything that seems vague; do not solve 
all his problems or remove all his difficulties; on the contrary  
-P-A-G-E-210
192 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
confront him with problematic situations, let him grapple 
with them, and try to solve his own difficulties. So train the 
child that he will develop the power of independent inquiry. 
In a word, make your instruction genuinely educative, de- 
velopmental, stimulative of mental growth. 
Applicability to deficients. These principles are now a 
commonplace in the pedagogy of the normal child, but they 
are quite applicable to the training of subnormals, too, al- 
though the latter require more telling, more direction, more 
demonstration, and more use of imitation. There is a place 
for telling and coaching in the special classes, but we must 
not consider the defective child so impotent or deficient that 
he cannot be trusted to attempt to solve any problems for 
himself, but must be told everything, have everything ex- 
plained, and have everything done for him. Give him every 
opportunity, with no more than necessary guidance, to at- 
tempt the solution of problems within his range of interest, 
understanding, and motor dexterity. Unless he is given 
such opportunities, one of the ultimate objectives of teach- 
ing cannot be realized; namely, so to develop the powers and 
capacities of the pupils that they will in time become inde- 
pendent of the teacher’s tutelage. We can, of course, only 
realize this ideal in part with children who are feeble-minded. 
How to apply the principle. To apply this principle it is 
necessary first to discover what the pupil knows or does not 
know, and then to lead him by skillful developmental ques- 
tioning to discover what he does not know, by recalling 
known facts, by observing, comparing, analyzing, and think- 
ing about facts and the relations between facts, and by ex- 
pressing himself in words and action. The child should be 
permitted and encouraged to ask questions, but the teacher 
must not wait for the child to interrogate. She must make 
an active effort to explore his past experiences, discover his 
“apperceptive bases,” and lead him through skilled “So-
-P-A-G-E-211
  
EFFICIENCY OF INSTRUCTION 193 
cratic” or “developmental” questioning to advance from 
the well-known to the less well-known. In addition, the 
teacher must set vital problems for the child to solve which 
will oblige him to recall and apply facts and processes already 
acquired to the solution of the new problems. 
4. From the known to the unknown. We should proceed 
from the “known to the unknown,” building the super- 
structure of new facts, knowledges, principles, and skills on 
the solid foundation of the old and familiar. Begin with the 
child’s level of attainment and knowledge, with the familiar 
facts which he has acquired in the home, in the neighbor- 
hood, in the home city, and in the school. Thus geography 
teaching is now begun with the child’s immediate environ- 
ment, his home, his block, and his city. Gradually his ho- 
rizon is extended into the realms of the unknown — the 
State, the Nation, and the world. No solid superstructure 
of knowledge or understanding can be built on an insecure 
foundation of ignorance, superstition, or error. Therefore 
one of the teacher’s first tasks is to probe, search, and dis- 
cover what the child knows or does not know, what he can 
do or cannot do, and what he must know and be able to com- 
prehend and do before he is ready to take the next step. 
Frequent violation of principle. Although these injunc- 
tions have become hackneyed platitudes, it is unfortunately 
the fact that they are frequently violated in special-class 
work, mainly because of the tendency of teachers to take too 
much for granted. They proceed on the assumption that 
the child knows far more than he actually does. They fre- 
quently fail to get down to the bedrock of what the child 
actually knows, understands, and can do. They start on 
too high a level, and fail because the child does not possess 
the necessary control of the elementary processes and tools. 
Had they aided the child in getting control of the more ele- 
mentary processes and tools, he would have been able to 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  194° EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
solve some of the more complex problems himself. To il- 
lustrate: A child of about eleven who was referred as a sus- 
pected mental defective was remanded to an ungraded class 
as a slightly backward case for special coaching in arith- 
metic in which he was particularly deficient. The teacher 
was instructed with particular care to find the child’s actual 
level of competency and build up step by step from this firm 
foundation, taking care that the child fully understood every 
step and that all the gaps in his knowledge of the arith- 
metical processes were properly filled. In spite of this re- 
commendation, the report two months later showed no im- 
provement. On the occasion of my visit to the school some- 
what later, it became perfectly apparent that the teacher 
had not gone down low enough for her foundation work. 
The child’s actual level of competency was nearer the first 
part of the second grade than the first part of the third 
grade. A fresh start was made from this bedrock of know- 
ledge, with the result that the child did more than three 
grades of work during the ensuing year. This child’s handi- 
cap was due more to a poor start than to genuine deficiency 
in number work. By building on the foundation of the 
known and proceeding from known facts to closely related 
facts, we shall further the progress even of children who are 
defective or who have specific defects. 
Avoidance of treadmill repetition. It is, however, neces- 
sary to insist that, after the child’s level has been ascer- 
tained, there must be no dawdling through constant repeti- 
tion of what the child already knows and can do. There 
must be constant advance. A process should be dropped, at 
least temporarily, after it has served its purpose. 
5. From the simple to the complex. This principle, em- 
phasized in the old pedagogy to the point where it became 
axiomatic, seems to be out of harmony with the project 
method and problem-solving method now largely used in the
-P-A-G-E-213
  
EFFICIENCY OF INSTRUCTION 195 
schools for normal children, in which practice or drill is se- 
cured as an incident to engaging in complicated projects, 
although, of course, it is possible with the use of this method 
to begin with simple projects and proceed to more compli- 
cated ones. With mental defectives, however, the proper 
gradation of the exercises or learning steps is frequently an 
essential condition of teaching success. To confront a low- 
grade mental defective with a complex problem beyond his 
powers of analysis or execution is to invite failure and dis- 
couragement. It is frequently advisable, therefore, to begin 
the training of young or low-grade children with simple ex- 
ercises involving the use of the large, axial muscles, such 
exercises as walking, running, skipping, simple rhythmic ex- 
ercises and games, sweeping, dusting, scrubbing, washing the 
blackboards, handling large tools, driving nails into a block 
of wood, first indiscriminately and then by filling in outlines, 
sawing scraps of wood with or without the aid of guiding 
lines, putting together a board and legs for a crude table or 
bench, lifting, carrying, and superposing bricks or large 
blocks, transferring stones around a circular field (an exer- 
cise used for imbeciles at Waverley), braiding with heavy 
twine, sewing with a large bodkin or using a large needle 
with sewing cards, making small mats, and the like. Such 
crude activities will afford muscular exercise, stimulate to 
exertion, develop control of hand, foot, and eye, and prepare 
the way for more refined and complicated adjustments. 
Germane to the discussion of this topic are the remarks of 
the following section. . 
6. Systematic, orderly progress. There must be a sys- 
tematic sequence of steps and orderly progress in special- 
class work. It is not implied that there should be a rigid 
curriculum, with the steps definitely blocked out as in the 
regular grades. What is meant is that there should be con- 
stant advance in every branch of study. There is no place
-P-A-G-E-214
196 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
in the special class for mere capriciousness, mere toying, or 
haphazard sampling of this, that, and the other activity 
without plan or progress. There are, my observation has 
shown, some special-class teachers who proceed without 
chart or compass. They jump from topic to topic without 
any order. They present disconnected fragments or lessons 
which are quite unrelated to each other. Their chief con- 
cern seems to be to fill in the time with activities of some 
kind, and to amuse or entertain the pupils. They undoubt- 
edly feel that the children will get much of value in the pro- 
cess. There is, of course, no objection to presenting lessons 
entertainingly (provided the teaching exercise is not trans- 
formed into a mere entertainment or diversion), provided 
there is constant advance and progress in every branch, 
whether it is reading, arithmetic, spelling, or woodwork, 
basketry, or brush-making, but there is no place for helter- 
skelter, planless, arbitrary, fortuitous, and circuitous teach- 
ing in the special classes. Some order of progression must be 
followed in the development of interests, facts, or skills in 
every phase of activity, whether the order follows the log- 
ical sequence or the “natural” or “psychological” order of 
learning. There are those who believe there is a natural 
order of development, although the detailed steps have not 
been determined to a nicety. 
Application to clay, wood, and metal. Thus, work in clay 
would “naturally” precede work in wood, while work in 
wood would precede that in metals. Ours was a race of 
molders a long time before it became a race of carpenters. 
The modern child delights to mold in clay and play in sand — 
a long time before he is interested in, or capable of, molding 
in wood. Clay is far more plastic and easily manipulated 
than wood. The same clay product can be transformed into 
almost innumerable forms and objects. 
Considering the course in clay modeling itself, a progres-

sive series of steps of increasing difficulty could no doubt be 
outlined, beginning with round work (the cylinder and ball, 
with their numerous possible modifications), flat design and 
tracery work on plaques, coil work, concrete work, glazed 
enamel work, faience, pottery and pottery designs; however, 
clay, plasticine, and wax modeling can be taught success- 
fully as accessories to other activities, and most teachers 
will probably prefer to so teach it. 
Application to weaving and needlework. It would be 
equally easy to apply this principle to the teaching of weav- 
ing, knitting, sewing, and crocheting. The beginner, start- 
ing with crude weaving exercises, with the use of oilcloth 
strips or colored linen strips and slat weavers, will proceed 
to the use of the ordinary weaving frame strung with alter- 
nating colors (which will aid him to make the under and 
over movements properly), then proceed to raffia and reed 
weaving in connection with the making of crude mats and 
simple baskets (using reed that can be easily woven), then 
go on to rug- and carpet-making, first with the hand loom 
and then with the foot loom, then to sewing (first making 
crude objects, with large needles, starting with hand and 
proceeding to machine sewing), then darning or knitting, 
chair-caning (preceded by weaving easily manipulated flat 
reed), cord or macramé work of various kinds, and brush- 
making. 
7. Objective and concrete methods. The methods and 
materials of instruction should be predominantly objective 
and concrete. Teach by means of things, objects, processes, 
activities, projects, representations, illustrations, dramatiza- 
tions, paintings, cinema pictures, “object lessons,” field ex- 
plorations and excursions, the use of museum materials, and 
the like, rather than by means of words, symbols, verbal 
repetitions, rules, formulas, principles, or abstractions. De- 
fective children are ordinarily “thing-minded” rather than
-P-A-G-E-216
  
  198 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
“word-minded,” or “thought-minded.” They are “eye- 
minded,” “ear-minded,” or “muscle-minded” rather than 
predisposed toward cogitation or reflection. They are in- 
stinctively interested in things, the doings of things, and in 
activities. They attend more readily to the visible and 
tangible, and more readily comprehend the concrete. Ab- 
stractions, or formulas and verbal descriptions, on the other 
hand, may be entirely incomprehensible if at all involved, 
and therefore do not interest them, command their atten- 
tion, or lead to fruitful reactions. Moreover, manipulating 
objects creates problematic situations and breakdowns in 
the child’s experience which he can easily understand, and 
which are far more potent in motivating his work than 
merely reading or thinking about situations, or working out 
intellectual solutions, the correctness of which he is incap- 
able of determining. 
Advantages of abstract thinking. While the view men- 
tioned above is the accepted one and doubtless correct, it 
should not blind us to the desirability of leading the child, 
just as far as may be possible, to conceptualize, to think in 
abstract terms, and to understand the abstractions which 
are most intimately related to the practical concerns of his 
workaday existence. Abstractions are exceedingly econom- 
ical instruments of control. A concept is a “rolled-up judg- 
ment” often containing a wealth of information. It is a 
device whereby we can readily recall, condense, group, class- 
ify, and generalize our past experiences. The concept is a 
shorthand of thought, containing all the elements common 
toaclass. By means of a verbal symbol we are enabled to 
refer to an illimitable number of objects without the arduous 
necessity of reénvisaging the individual objects. Clearly we 
must train the defective child to become as efficient as pos- 
sible in abstract thinking, in forming correct concepts, and 
_ applying correct terms. He must be trained to compare, to
-P-A-G-E-217
  
EFFICIENCY OF INSTRUCTION 199 
note resemblances and differences, to abstract differences, 
to associate resemblances (that is, to generalize), to see the 
general in the particular, to draw conclusions possessing 
more or less general validity, to apply the generalized facts 
to particular cases, and to acquire a correct terminology. 
Graded recession from the concrete. But in order to at- 
tain this difficult goal, it is necessary that the ascent or pro- 
gression from the concrete to the abstract be made by very 
easy stages, from the more to the less concrete. The process 
may be illustrated from one of the methods used by Maria 
Montessori to teach abstract form to children. The child 
begins by handling solid forms. Then he superposes such 
forms on corresponding plane shapes or cardboards, the first 
set of cardboards containing forms made out of blue paper, 
the second set only the contours of the forms in a broad blue 
strip one centimeter wide, and the third set only the contour 
in a mere hair line. The progression is from the solid to the 
plane figure, from the broad contour to the narrow contour, 
and from this to the abstract idea. Such a fine gradation 
is not required by normals, but defectives find it difficult to 
pass from the concrete to the abstract by a sheer plunge. 
With defectives it is perhaps never safe wholly to discard 
the visible and the tangible. The abstractions must be 
constantly interpreted and revitalized by concrete refer- 
ence. 
8. The doctrine of interest. Proceed from the child’s 
native and acquired interests. Interest supplies a powerful 
entering wedge, an ‘“‘open Sesame” to the child’s mind. To 
elicit a child’s interest is to insure attention, secure ready, 
enthusiastic codperation and maximal output of effort. Our 
earliest interests all rest on an instinctive basis, and all ac- 
quired interests have, perhaps, in the last analysis, evolved 
from, and represent sublimations of, instincts and native 
impulses. 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  200 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
Necessity of inventorying assets and liabilities in the 
field of the instincts. It is of utmost importance in the case 
of defectives to discover what instincts they possess, and 
what instincts are lacking. In the defective or abnormal 
child instincts are often lacking, excessive, abnormal, or 
perverted. This is frequently the cause of serious social or 
educational maladjustments. Unless these abnormalities 
are known, it will be impossible properly to interpret the 
child’s behavior or intelligently to direct his activities. Thus 
we must, to illustrate, understand that idiots as a class lack 
certain instincts essential for mental growth; for example, 
the instincts of play, constructiveness, and curiosity. They 
are even deficient in one of the two fundamental instincts, 
the instinct of sex or self-preservation. Fortunately the 
vast majority possess the other fundamental instinct, hun- 
ger, which can be utilized as a powerful motive in their 
training. They will often respond to attempts at training 
when the appetite for food or drink is rewarded. Our efforts 
are not infrequently frustrated by perversions of the in- 
stincts, which result in the formation of undesirable interfer- 
ing habits. Lightner Witmer cites a case (“Don”) in which 
a condition simulating feeble-mindedness and excessive inat- 
tention to all new persons or things was induced by morbid 
fears. But when the fears were dissipated, the child’s devel- 
opment proceeded with surprising rapidity. It is well not to 
forget that a defective child who is timid or subject to in- 
hibitions, often unknown because hidden or obscure, suffers 
a grave double handicap. The treatment of fear, one of the 
great motive forces of human conduct, is of fundamental 
concern in teaching, but its significance is usually unrecog- 
nized or misunderstood. We forget that it is the whole child 
who goes to school, that it is the whole child who needs to 
be trained, and not merely a selected portion of his person- 
ality.
-P-A-G-E-219
  
EFFICIENCY OF INSTRUCTION 201 
Utilize nascent interests. But we must not only attempt 
to list the child’s assets and liabilities in the field of impulse, 
instinct, and acquired interests; we must also strive to 
understand how the instincts and interests change from year 
to year or period to period, so that advantage may be taken 
of nascent interests. “Strike while the iron is hot.” Watch 
for the appearance of new interests, and occurrences which 
will serve as a point of attachment for a body of new in- 
terests. 
It is well to ask ourselves what we ought to be teaching 
the child at different periods of development. Obviously 
the answer will depend to some extent on his budding inter- 
ests. We should seek to determine the instincts and devel- 
oping interests which lie at the base of any school activity, 
and then utilize them in creating other interests and atti- 
tudes. The resourceful teacher will find innumerable ways 
in which to do this. 
The things we teach most successfully in the special class 
are those most closely related to the child’s interests, native 
and acquired. 
Application of doctrine of interest to manual work. We 
can put manual work across with these children because it 
has a vital appeal. It appeals to certain deep-rooted in- 
stincts and interests: play, constructiveness, manipulation, 
curiosity, acquisitiveness, activity, and muscular exercise. 
These natural forces can, however, be utilized more fully if 
the manual training is made to conform to the “natural 
course of development.’ While we are not now in possession 
of the facts which will enable us to determine precisely what 
this “natural order” is, it will be dependent to some extent 
on the nascent stages of interest, on the stages of maturation 
of the different muscle groups employed, and on the pro- 
gression from the more simple to the more complex, as sug- 
gested on a preceding page.
-P-A-G-E-220
  
  202 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
We can ask many questions in this domain for which sci- 
ence has not yet supplied the answer. When shall the vari- 
ous types of tools be used — the hammer, the saw, the knife 
— or various types of exercises — the formal, the project? 
What should be the earliest form of manual work for children 
with poor muscular codrdination? The usual answer is: 
begin with large tools, tools that are easily handled; with 
coarse work, with work utilizing large muscle groups, and 
with materials that are easily manipulated. 
Interest in relation to the project and drill methods. The 
attempt to organize the work more fully in harmony with 
the doctrine of interest has led, however, to the demand that 
the children should be started with project or problem work, 
or the manufacture of useful articles, rather than with for- 
mal drills or single operations. While this tendency is to be 
commended, many authorities possessing extensive experi- 
ence with mental defectives of low grade or with serious 
muscular incodrdinations feel that better results are obtained 
by developing partial or specific skills by formal drills on 
simple processes, such as those mentioned above in connec- 
tion with the fifth teaching principle. To start a child who 
has no control of the tools or of the elementary processes on 
complicated problems will cause blundering, the spoiling of 
tools and materials, confusion and loss of confidence. It is 
emphasized that the purpose of the manual training at the 
outset for such cases is to improve muscular codrdination, to 
develop hand skill, to acquire dexterity in handling the tools, 
rather than to produce an artistic product; that these re- 
sults are achieved most rapidly by repeated drills, and that 
the method is not contrary to the doctrine of interest or the 
psychology of habit formation, because mental defectives 
enjoy repetition. 
9. Correlation and project methods. Extensive use should 
be made of the method of “concentration” or “correlation,”
-P-A-G-E-221
  
EFFICIENCY OF INSTRUCTION 203 
or of the problem or project methods. The latter methods 
may be regarded as a recent adaptation and elaboration of 
the old method of correlation. The project method has been 
defined as a “problematic act involving the use of concrete 
material in a constructive way in a life setting, or in a nat- 
ural setting,” or as a “problematic act carried to completion 
in its natural setting” (J. A. Stevenson). The implications 
underlying this definition are: first, that the activity must 
duplicate the problems of life, in consequence of which the 
same materials (wood, iron, clay, etc.) and processes must be 
used in the school activities as in workaday extra-school 
pursuits; second, the problematic situation must demand 
reasoning instead of mere memorizing; third, the problem- 
solving activity must precede and lead up to the statement 
of the principles; and, fourth, the act must be carried to a 
successful conclusion. According to this definition, make- 
believe situations (such as the stock activities in the modern 
kindergarten) are not projects, although they may be prob- 
lems. The problem emphasizes the intellectual solution of 
a problematic situation without the necessity of using nat- 
ural settings. 
The essential idea of the method of correlation is the group- 
ing of instruction around a center, “core,” or “project.” 
The more subjects which can be effectively correlated the 
better the core. Three illustrations will make clear how the 
method may be applied in the special schools: 
Illustrations: building a playhouse. The building and 
equipping of a playhouse or a doll’s house furnishes a very 
fertile core around which to center many interests, activ- 
ities, and subjects of instruction. In the building construc- 
tion activities, abundant opportunities are afforded for 
wholesome physical exercise and for developing skill in the 
use of tools and acquiring knowledge of building processes, 
materials, and furnishings. Practical arithmetical training
-P-A-G-E-222
    204 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
is afforded in connection with measuring the dimensions of 
the various parts of the house, buying and selling tools, 
materials, furnishings, clothing, food, making up family bud- 
gets, and the like in the “make-believe” school store. Les- 
sons in local and commercial geography reinforced by visit« 
to near-by commercial and industrial plants, parks, and 
museums, are related to the study of the processes of produc- 
tion and distribution. Lessons in language and literature 
can be given in connection with the study of types of houses 
and the characteristics of the home life found among people 
of different races and stations in life. This may lead to the 
study of different races, or elementary facts in ethnology. 
Facts concerning the home life may be brought out: the re- 
lations between parents and siblings, the mutual duties and 
obligations which the members owe to one another, to neigh- 
bors, friends, fellow citizens, and to the State, love of home 
and love of country, family customs and traditions, and the 
like. Instruction in hygiene, physiology, and health can be 
given in connection with the care and hygiene of the house, 
art instruction in connection with the decoration of the play- 
house, while practice in theme or story writing and telling 
can be obtained by having the child depict the various stages 
and activities connected with the construction of the play- 
house, and his activities in his home. 
Making illustrated booklets. The making of topical, 
monthly, or seasonal calendars or booklets (with everything 
converging around a designated theme, such as “Thanks- 
giving Day,” “Christmas Time,” or “Autumn Days”’) 
affords opportunities for preserving the busy-work in an at- 
tractive, substantial form, for correlating the busy-work 
with the various subjects taught during the recitation period, 
for making practical use of the knowledge thus gained, and 
for awakening demands for further knowledge and skill. 
What activities can be correlated around such an activity?
-P-A-G-E-223
  EFFICIENCY OF INSTRUCTION 205 
The measuring and cutting of the pages and covers for the 
booklet; the gathering, cutting, and pasting of appropriate 
pictures; the drawing in black and in colors of appropriate 
sketches; the making of calendar pages, with the numbers 
and names of the months and days; the writing of an appro- 
priate story or historical sketch and memory gems; illus- 
trating with colored sketches or the cut-out pictures; the 
singing of appropriate songs; and the dramatizing of certain 
events. Considerable practice can be secured by requiring a 
certain quality of excellence in the penmanship, composi- 
tion, orthography, coloring, drawing, etc., before any page 
may be inserted. 
Constructing a crude village. A major project which pro- 
vided fruitful busy-work for all grades of defectives and sus- 
tained the interest during the entire year in a special school 
under my direction, consisted in the “construction of a vil- 
lage,” along one side of the schoolroom. The houses, made 
of boxes brought by the pupils, were not elaborate or fur- 
nished. The girls made homes and the boys shops. Each 
child was induced to express his own individuality and his 
own conception. Around this core were correlated: (a) lan- 
guage work, including discussion by the pupils of the occu- 
pations in the play shops, stores, and homes, which greatly 
enriched the vocabulary of the pupils, most of whom were 
Italians; (b) practical exercises in arithmetic, different pupils 
enacting the réles of blacksmith, baker, grocer, butcher, 
hardware merchant, home-maker, barber, and the like; (c) 
practice in writing and spelling, in connection with “‘write- 
ups” about the stores and the homes in the play village; (d) 
drawing, including the drawing of the shops and houses, the 
goods on the shelves and counters, and articles in the home, 
properly labeled; (e) geography and nature study, including 
discussions of the kinds of buildings and domiciles found in 
their city, the United States, and foreign lands, and of the  
-P-A-G-E-224
  206 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
materials used in the homes and in house construction, nails, 
lumber, sand, wool, cotton, silk, etc.; (f) observation lessons 
based on materials borrowed from the school museum; and 
(g) lessons in furnishing, decorating, and caring for the home. 
The low-grade cases acted as aides (for example, in carrying 
materials), and drew crude representations of articles sold in 
the shop. Each child preserved his written material in a 
large envelope. It is evident that many minor projects 
were correlated around this extensive major project. 
This is the way much of the reading, arithmetic, spelling, 
writing, and manumental activities should be taught in the 
special schools. Innumerable topics are available as cores, 
problems, or projects: New York Harbor, the children of the 
North, camping on the fishing bank, life on the farm, trans- 
portation systems, ventilating the home, our city block, bak- 
ing a loaf of bread, or cultivating vegetables in the school 
garden. 
Value of the correlation, problem, or project method 
What are the specific values of this type of lesson ? 
(a) It is dynamic, or vitally motivated, thus arousing a 
high degree of interest, and sustaining the interest for long 
periods of time. The interest in the village construction 
activities referred to above was sustained at white heat dur- 
ing a whole school year, and at the close of the school year 
many children asked that the same construction activities 
might be continued the following fall. Interest is vitally 
stimulated because the child is afforded opportunities to be 
active —in the more elaborate exercises he indulges in 
highly diversified activities; because, dealing with concrete 
materials, he has a definite, measurable, and comprehen- 
sible objective in view; and because he is able to check up his 
errors and to gauge his skill, ability, and progress, in a way 
that he cannot do when applying himself to purely formal, 
bookish, intellectual, or unrelated exercises. He knows
-P-A-G-E-225
EFFICIENCY OF INSTRUCTION 207 
what he wants to do, and the thing he wants to do ordinarily 
interests him. He knows what means he must employ to 
reach his goal. If he is lacking in the necessary skills and 
makes mistakes, “the thing won’t work.” He sees visible 
€vidence of the breakdown of his adjustments, and this will 
stir him to try to master the necessary elements of control. 
(b) When taught in correlation the child’s knowledge be- 
gins to take on a meaning. “To know anything is to know 
it in its relations.” No fact can be understood except as it is 
related to other facts, particularly to its uses. Presented in 
their unity, and in their various relationships, number work, 
reading, spelling, writing, and drawing will acquire manifold 
vital meanings. The child will learn that, instead of being 
useless abstractions, they are useful tools which will give him 
a practical command over his environment. Moreover, the 
correlation method affords the child an opportunity to apply 
his knowledge while he is acquiring it. He is receiving train- 
ing in the selection of the controls, facts, and skills which 
will be required to solve similar problems in future. When 
the problems closely resemble the work he will do after leav- 
ing school, he is receiving direct practical training for life. 
(c) The correlation method affords abundant opportuni- 
ties for vitalized practice, because the same processes will be 
repeated in different phases of the activity. 
Practical suggestions. Two suggestions of practical mo- 
ment in the employment of this method should receive at- 
tention: 
Employ activities which interest the child. The first is to 
select ‘“‘centers of interest,” projects or problems which will 
appeal to the child, arouse his attention, and secure his will- 
ing codperation. The child is interested in activities which 
appeal to his needs at the time — which fit his stage of de- 
velopment — and which prepare him for the next step, and 
lead up to and anticipate his future needs. Play activities 
   
-P-A-G-E-226
  208 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
interest him par excellence. Fortunately, many of the 
spontaneous plays of children are imitations of adult activ- 
ities, and can be directed toward the preparation for future 
needs. Children are almost always interested in those activ- 
ities and pursuits of adults which are within their range of 
comprehension, and not too far removed from their develop- 
mental needs. This is one of the elements of strength of 
the project. As the child grows older, he also becomes inter- 
ested in codperative work or community enterprises. Pro- 
jects should be carried on as community undertakings, as 
was the construction of the village cited above. All the 
school activities should be so conducted as to socialize the 
child. Defective children need protracted training in team 
work. When they leave school they will become members 
of a social organism founded on the principle of the division 
of labor and codperative production, and this is true whether 
the child goes to a colony or remains at large in the commu- 
nity. 
Select projects requiring continuity of application. The 
second point is that problems or projects must be chosen 
which are extensive enough to cover weeks or months of 
time, in order that the defective may be adequately trained 
in the attributes in which he is frequently quite deficient; 
namely, sustained concentration and continuity of applica- 
tion. Many defectives are constantly drifting from job to 
job, like so much flotsam and jetsam. They do not stick to 
their jobs. This is, no doubt, sometimes due to the fact 
that they were not adequately trained in continuity of appli- 
cation. 
Some have advocated monthly centers of interest — using 
a patriotic motif in February, centering the instruction 
around the life and labor of Washington and Lincoln, germ- 
ination and farm life in March, harvesting in September. 
Thus rigidly to limit the “centers” to a calendar month
-P-A-G-E-227
  EFFICIENCY OF INSTRUCTION 209 
seems arbitrary and artificial. Some problems can be ade- 
quately covered in a week; others ought to cover several 
months. 
It goes without saying that effective use can be made of 
the method of correlation without the necessity of abandon- 
ing all other methods. Other methods can be used independ- 
ently or as supplementary aids. As already emphasized 
(p. 189), it is difficult to attain the same degree of profi- 
ciency in the employment of this method when the instruc- 
tion is departmentalized as when the teacher has charge of 
the children throughout the day. The difficulty can be over- 
come only by complete coéperation and frequent conferences 
between the different teachers. 
The Model Stores Equipment, secured almost gratis 
through Educational Foundations, 23 Flatbush Avenue, 
New York City, lends itself admirably for use in connection 
with correlation activities, and is of particular value in sup- 
plying a wealth of concrete material for the instruction in 
arithmetic. 
to. Lesson Planning. Successful work in special classes 
cannot be conducted without definite preparation or lesson 
planning. In planning a lesson, the teacher must have 
clearly in mind the objective to be reached, and the meth- 
ods, stages, processes, devices, tools, and materials which 
are to be employed and which must be placed in readiness 
for each lesson. She must know how the subject-matter of 
any particular lesson is to be connected with earlier lessons 
and with projected lessons, how the facts learned are going 
to be applied, and how the lesson is going to be put across 
to the pupil. An elaborate plan, containing the detailed 
questions, approaches, and procedures, is not usually re- 
quired; an outline plan usually sufficing for the trained 
teacher. 
Planning needed in all branches. This sort of lesson plan-
-P-A-G-E-228
  210 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
ning is needed from day to day, unless the plan as constructed 
covers several days, or weeks, or months. In the latter case, 
however, there is danger that the impressions will become 
so vague that the plan will be of little practical service unless 
it is properly reviewed. Preparation or planning is needed 
in practically every phase of the special-class program, in- 
cluding the opening exercises. Opening exercises or assem- 
blies which are planned on the “inspiration of the moment” 
— which is frequently the case — often tend, in our experi- 
ence, to become dull, insipid, monotonous, and lacking in 
continuity, in “appropriateness for the occasion,” and in the 
progressive realization of certain definite objectives which 
should be attained during the assembly period. But if you 
cannot trust to luck and inspiration in conducting the gen- 
eral exercises, you can do so even less in story-telling, read- 
ing, arithmetic, physical training, manual work, and em- 
phatically not in the use of the problem-solving project, and 
correlation methods. The teacher who attempts to “get 
by” on mere inspiration, initiative, resourcefulness, and the 
fortuitous concurrence of events will find that her work will 
rapidly deteriorate and run to seed, it will be lacking in defi- 
nite objective, and in orderly progress and continuity, and it 
will not be effectively put across to the pupil. 
Is lesson planning needed in special classes? It is some- 
times averred that because of the teacher’s manifest supe- 
riority in intelligence, knowledge, and insight compared with 
the simple minds under her care, no lesson planning is re- 
quired in the special classes. Obviously the teacher may 
“get by” without preparation so far as being discovered by 
the pupils is concerned. If she is personally likable, the 
pupils will like her whether she instructs well or poorly. 
But she cannot “get by” on the pragmatic test of “deliv- 
ering the goods” so far as this relates to the maximal devel-. 
opment of the child’s powers and capacities through skillful 
teaching.
-P-A-G-E-229
EFFICIENCY OF INSTRUCTION 211 
More rather than less preparation needed in special-class 
work. Contrary to this opinion, it is probable that more 
lesson planning is needed in the special classes than in the 
regular grades, if the instruction is to be conducted on the 
same level of efficiency. In the regular grades the teacher 
has the advantage of the use of carefully worked-out texts, 
and of detailed syllabi, constructed for the purpose of aiding 
her to follow rather closely the course of study blocked out 
for her particular grade, and which she is expected to cover 
within a definitely prescribed period of time. In the special 
classes the program is mapped out only in general outline, 
and the teacher is given much freedom in planning the de- 
tails of the course. But it is expected of the teacher of spe- 
cial classes that she will skillfully adjust and modify the train- 
ing to meet the differing needs of the different pupils, not 
only at the time that they enter the class, but from time to 
time as their developing needs become apparent. Certainly 
this cannot be efficiently done without study, preparation, 
and “lesson planning.” Although radical modification may 
not be needed in the basic elements of the instruction, never- 
theless the procedures, processes, and materials must be so 
adjusted that they will meet the particular needs of the in- 
dividual child. In spite of their mental inferiority, these 
children have set many problems which the experts in edu- 
cation and psychology have not yet fully solved. The true 
teacher receives her highest reward from the transformation 
she has wrought in her pupils, and will not shirk her respon- 
sibilities. 
Everything that has been said in this section applies with 
particular force to the preparation and administration of 
the seat-work. 
11. Supervision of seat-work. The “seat-work” or 
“busy-work” must be constantly planned and supervised 
by the teacher so that the child will be kept occupied with
-P-A-G-E-230
212 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
work which is genuinely therapeutic, educative, or develop- 
mental, instead of dawdling away his time in profitless, in- 
attentive, mechanical repetitions, or in idleness, daydream- 
ing, or mischief-making. It would be difficult to exaggerate 
the amount of fruitless effort or of waste of time and energy 
which may occur during the unsupervised “busy-periods” 
in classes for the mentally deficient, owing to the dilly- 
dallying, loafing, or indolent proclivities of defectives, and 
the way in which they spend their time listlessly repeating 
the same exercises day after day, or mechanically “toying” 
with the same familiar exercises — matching colors, thread- 
ing beads, arranging splints in patterns — which they can do 
perfectly well, which set no problem, excite no interest, and 
develop no new skills or knowledge. It may be contended 
that even such unmotivated repetitions possess some virtue 
in keeping a child out of mischief. But most aimless, me- 
chanical exercises possess little educative value, and often 
lay the foundation for the development of habits of careless, 
indifferent, non-productive work, or whiling away time. 
Children rapidly tire of mechanical repetitions of familiar 
processes, and therefore spend their time in soldiering, day- 
dreaming, aimlessly watching the other pupils, or getting 
into mischief. 
Requirements of profitable seat-work. In order to be 
educationally profitable, the seat-work must set tasks for 
the pupils to solve which are genuine problems, which chal- 
lenge thought, engage attention, and require sustained con- 
centration, and which are properly correlated with the reci- 
tation work, so that the seat-work will prepare for the 
recitation, and also furnish opportunities for the applica- 
tion of the facts learned in the recitation. 
Difficulty of supervising busy-work. The efficient admin- 
istration of the seat-work constitutes one of the teacher’s 
most important duties, as well as one of her most difficult
-P-A-G-E-231
  
EFFICIENCY OF INSTRUCTION 213 
tasks. It involves a twofold problem: that of preventing 
the pupils from idling away their own time and the time of 
other pupils, and that of directing their efforts into channels 
which will prove genuinely educative. There is no cure-all 
that will remedy this difficulty. The main solution lies in 
the constant supervision of the busy-work by the teacher. 
However, the older and higher-grade pupils, if properly di- 
rected, can render much aid in directing the activities of the 
lower-grade pupils. The teacher who is conscientiously 
striving to make the busy-periods a real force in the better- 
ment of the pupils is worthy of highest commendation. 
12. Encouragement. Praise and encouragement are very 
effective incentives to use with subnormal children. Praise 
stimulates particularly the feeble-minded to put forth their 
best efforts. Small rewards are often as effective with these 
children as large or intrinsically precious rewards among the 
normals. A mere word of commendation, an encouraging 
glance, an approving tap on the shoulder, will incite re- 
doubled effort in many defectives. This may be largely due 
to their self-love or egotism, for many are uncommonly ego- 
tistical and conceited. One of the drawbacks in the use of 
praise is the danger that it may unduly stimulate these pro- 
pensities, although many who admit this fact consider the 
danger to be very slight. Properly used, praise must be 
regarded as a legitimate instrument for energizing the edu- 
cational efforts of subnormal children. Reference will again 
be made to the use of this incentive as an aid in discipline. 
13. Use of promotion cards. Although the practice of 
issuing “promotion” or “report” cards for special-class 
pupils does not meet with universal approbation, such re- 
ports, properly made, will serve a useful purpose in stimu- 
lating the pupils and encouraging and satisfying the parents. 
We suggest that reports be issued at the end of the school 
year showing the quality of the work done by the pupils in
-P-A-G-E-232
  214 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
the various branches, and the amount of progress made dur- 
ing the course of the year, the attitudes which they have 
shown toward their school work, the habits and attitudes 
which they possess which are of social significance (courtesy, 
punctuality, promptness, diligence, industry, thriftfulness, 
self-reliance, dependability, self-control, respect for others, 
codperativeness, honesty, and the like), and their emotional, 
temperamental, and character traits. Printed forms can be 
expeditiously filled in by means of a system of symbols and 
check-marks. If a very limited report is preferred, it should 
show, at the very minimum, the amount of improvement 
which the child has made during the course of the year, for 
this is the matter which most deeply concerns most parents. 
Owing to the very slow progress made by the mentally defec- 
tive and by many subnormals, it is necessary to use smaller 
promotion steps than the whole-year or whole-grade steps. 
Otherwise the annual report cards will seem to show that 
the child has made no advance whatever, for many who are 
doing first-grade work at the beginning of the school year 
will still be doing first-grade work at the end of the year, 
although they have made some progress. They may have 
made ten weeks of progress during the forty weeks, but the 
promotion card, if constructed on the basis of whole-year or 
half-year steps, will conceal this fact, so that the conclusion 
may follow that the children have been standing still edu- 
cationally. We therefore suggest for use in the special 
classes for subnormals the quarterly system of steps in vogue 
in the St. Louis schools, marking the children in first grade 
as I-1, I-2, I-83, or J-4, according as they are doing first 
quarter, second quarter, third quarter, or fourth quarter 
work. This will make it possible correctly to record the 
progress of children who have only advanced one quarter, 
and there will be many of these children in the specials. The 
inevitable tendency where the half-year or whole-year steps
-P-A-G-E-233
EFFICIENCY OF INSTRUCTION 215 
are used is to give exaggerated progress ratings, with the re- 
sult that the child will eventually have to be graded down, 
which will excite keen disappointment in the parents, who 
will consider that their children not only have not improved 
but have actually deteriorated — an unjustifiable inference, 
for the vast majority of mental inferiors improve slowly up 
to their limit. 
The vital necessity of translating theory into practice. 
Finally a word of exhortation: the mere intellectual recog- 
nition of the above teaching principles, which we regard as 
vital conditions of successful special-class work, will avail 
nothing unless the teacher, imbued by the ambition of teach- 
ing up to the highest ideals and standards of the profession, 
sets about resolutely to put them into practice. Unless the 
teacher periodically calls to mind the principles governing 
an effective teaching technique, she will forget some of them 
and begin to drift. It is easy to “teach down,” but it re- 
quires constant wakefulness and resolution to “teach up” to 
a high standard of craftsmanship. The teacher-in-training 
should begin by applying the best standards of teaching 
craftsmanship during her period of practice teaching. 
There are two further conditions on which the success of 
special-class teaching is vitally dependent, namely, the 
suitability of the curriculum and the efficiency of the teacher, 
which we shall discuss at some length in the next chapter.

  CHAPTER IX 
THE CURRICULUM AND THE TEACHER OF THE 
CLASS FOR THE MENTALLY DEFICIENT 
I. Tae Specrat-Ciass CurricuLum 
To outline in detail the special-class curriculum would re- 
quire a text on the pedagogy of the subnormal. This book is 
not intended to be a technical treatise of that character. 
Within its fixed limits it is possible merely to offer a few sug- 
gestions on seven fundamental divisions of the curriculum. 
1. Direct health work and physical training 
A generous amount of time should be devoted to hygienic 
and physical training, including the teaching of facts re- 
garding the care of the body and the preservation of health, 
the development of proper health habits, the prevention of 
accidents and injuries, and the supplying of adequate phy- 
sical training. The purpose of the physical training is to in- 
cite responses or movements in the children subject to di- 
minished motility or muscular asthenia, to inhibit or suppress 
excessive, spasmodic or useless movements (automatisms) in 
those subject to excessive motility or hyperkinesis, to over- 
come specific muscular deformities, contractures, or weak- 
nesses, to develop voluntary muscular control, to increase 
strength (or the bulk of the muscles), skill (codrdination of 
the muscles), endurance (affecting particularly respiration, 
circulation and excretion), grace and harmony of movement, 
physical and mental health, and to develop mental alertness, 
concentration, courage, confidence, judgment, and the spirit 
of fair play and sportsmanship. The exercises should in-
-P-A-G-E-235
THE CURRICULUM AND THE TEACHER 217 
clude, in addition to some of the ordinary gymnastic ap- 
paratus work: : 
(1) Corrective gymnastics, medico-mechanical gymnas- 
tics, physiotherapy, mechanotherapy, vibration, massage or 
passive movements (for improving local nutrition and cir- 
culation), and orthopedic treatment. These exercises are 
designed to correct or reduce postural defects, orthopedic 
defects or physical deformities, such as shoulder or spinal 
deformities, paralytic conditions, contractures of the liga- 
ments or muscles, or flat-footedness. The value of specific 
corrective training of this type has been amply demon- 
strated in the schools for the crippled, in the medico-mechan- 
ical institutes and in the rehabilitation hospitals and camps 
for the soldiers maimed in the late war. Very little use, how- 
ever, has been made of specific corrective training in the 
classes for the mentally inferior — far less than the situation 
justifies — although many games, gymnastic exercises, and 
various forms of handwork are of great value in overcoming 
specific physical defects and in improving coérdination. 
Special effort should be made to evoke responses in the 
torpid pupils, to improve the posture and to overcome the 
shambling, shuffling, dragging gait characteristic of so many, 
to strengthen their power of grasp and to improve the coér- 
dination of the finger and hand movements. 
It may be necessary to “bombard” the child (for exam- 
ple, by throwing bean bags at him) to attract his attention 
and awaken his sensibility in order to incite warding off, 
catching, holding, and throwing movements. Attractive 
stimuli (for example, bright objects), music, and playful 
competition will aid in calling forth movements. A pendu- 
lum game in which the children, standing in a circle, try to 
strike a large rubber ball attached to a cord, will arouse pre- 
hensive and striking movements. 
Exercises of value for improving the gait are contests of
-P-A-G-E-236
218 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
walking on tiptoe, running to command up or down hill, 
walking over uneven places or irregularly placed marks on 
the ground, walking on the balancing board, on a chalk line, 
on bricks placed at regular intervals, stepping over bean bags 
or between the rounds of a ladder placed horizontally on the 
floor, and leaping from a spring board which develops elas- 
ticity in the sagging legs. The ladder is one of the most use- 
ful appliances for correcting defects. In addition to its use, 
as above indicated, it can be placed obliquely against the 
wall to permit of exercises for strengthening the arm muscles 
and for overcoming round shoulders or spinal curvature. 
Standing beneath the ladder, the child should be required to 
pull himself up to the top by passing the hands alternately 
from round to round. With his back against a narrow 
smooth board placed on top of the rounds, he should be re- 
quired to pull himself to the top of the ladder and then let 
himself down, by passing the hands alternately from round 
to round. By placing the ladder in the horizontal position 
at various elevations from the floor (to suit children of dif- 
ferent heights) the child may swing by the hands from round 
to round. Poise may be improved and the tendency to 
stoop corrected by carrying objects balanced on the head, 
such as a book or basket. The strength of grasp and finger 
coédrdination may be improved by the exercises already given, 
such as hanging, climbing, catching, throwing, and by club 
swinging, throwing at a target, ring toss, playing jack straws 
and fish pond, block building, peg-board pattern construc- 
tion, weaving, and by a host of industrial arts activities. 
(2) Sports, athletics, plays, and games, including games 
for sensori-motor and mental training, and physical con- 
tests. For all-round physical training, sports and games 
are undoubtedly the most valuable. They arouse more 
interest and effort, have far greater socializing value, and 
usually provide more vigorous exercise for a larger number 
 
-P-A-G-E-237
  THE CURRICULUM AND THE TEACHER 219 
of muscle groups. The normal child plays spontaneously. 
He is inquisitive — a genuine Paul Pry, a born experimenter, 
‘ who is eager to find out for himself — he has a superabun- 
dance of energy and delights in exercising his powers. Left 
alone he will largely educate himself by spontaneous play. 
But the mentally deficient child, especially the lower grade 
child, is not much inclined to play, particularly to partake in 
organized games. He must be urged and taught to play. 
The teacher should take special pains to stimulate, direct, 
and organize the play activities of mental defectives. 
(8) Calisthenics and rhythm work, including folk dancing 
and eurhythmics (Dalcroze) accompanied by music. Music 
and rhythm make a very strong appeal to the mentally de- 
ficient and ought to be utilized in the physical training 
exercises whenever possible. This type of work is of great 
service in overcoming the awkward, clumsy, ungainly move- 
ments so characteristic of many defectives. Eurhythmics 
is a system of musical training accompanied by bodily move- 
ments, designed to develop codrdination of the mind and 
body, physical grace and self-control, to improve the car- 
riage, relax muscular tenseness, and develop hearing and 
musical appreciation. It is alleged that it is also of value 
in quickening the mentally deficient mentally. It should 
find a larger place in the special schools than is now the 
case. 
(4) Military drills, tactics, or other exercises intended to 
evoke quick and accurate responses and prompt obedience 
to commands, often of value in arousing defectives out of 
their lethargy and in preparing the way for more purely in- 
tellectual training. 
(5) Periodical setting-up exercises are of some value as a 
counter irritant to the tendency of the mentally deficient to 
assume a slouchy attitude in their seats. 
(6) Development of habits of personal cleanliness. It is
-P-A-G-E-238
  . 220 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
not sufficient to tell these children that they must come tr 
school with clean hands and faces, hair combed, their cloth: 
ing properly arranged and brushed, but they must be shown 
how to wash themselves clean and required to do so until 
they have formed the habit. The special schools ought to be 
provided with bath tubs and showers, especially the latter. 
The practice of beginning the school day with tooth brush 
drills should be widely extended. A very serviceable brush 
can be purchased at a nominal price from Takamine Manu- 
facturing Corporation, New York City. The tooth brushes, 
with the children’s numbers or names placed on the handles, 
should be suspended at appropriate distances, preferably in 
a container enclosed with wire netting. 
(7) Rest periods for relaxation and repose are of value for 
children with weak physical constitutions and powers of en- 
durance. Some hold that all the defectives should be given 
a lunch daily, followed by a nap on a couch preferably in an 
open-air room. Our experience has been that where a noon 
intermission is provided, as is almost invariably the case, 
this is necessary only for a very small proportion of defec- 
tives. Many mental defectives are more or less habitually 
weary or bored, but not genuinely fatigued. They do not 
exert themselves sufficiently to become fatigued. Of course, 
a nap in the early afternoon would be beneficial for all young 
children. : 
As much of the physical training as possible should be 
given out doors when the weather permits. 
E. G. Payne has constructed a scale for the measurement 
of habits and practices in health and accident prevention in 
which the pupil is assigned a certain score on various items 
relating to food, air, drink, exercise, sleep, posture, cleanli- 
ness, clothing, weight, height, and safety, and which makes 
possible a more accurate selection of the pupils with bad 
health habits, and more intelligent supervision of their health
-P-A-G-E-239
  THE CURRICULUM AND THE TEACHER 221 
practices and organization of remedial measures. There 
now exist many clubs, organizations, and leagues in all sec- 
tions of the country which will gladly supply tracts, pam- 
phlets, and information regarding the care of children’s 
health. 
2. Moral training 
The mentally deficient are not only in greater need of 
definite moral training than normal children, but most of 
them respond very favorably to such training. Two meth- 
ods of training are available. 
(a) Didactic instruction. This consists in furnishing en- 
lightenment concerning moral relations and obligations, 
virtue and vice, the difference between right and wrong, 
particular actions which must be avoided, and particular 
responses which should be acquired. Defectives need to be 
exhorted to do the right things and to avoid the wrong. 
They need enlightenment on the practical everyday virtues: 
on the duty of industry, honesty, truthtelling, sincerity, 
faithfulness, loyalty, dependability, fairness, courage to act 
justly and to resist the tendency to filch, deceive, skulk, and 
shirk; on the importance of honor and purity in all their per- 
sonal relations, including instruction in sex hygiene and sex 
ethics. These children need especially to have their morals 
safeguarded, particularly the girls. One of the most sacred 
duties of the teacher, which is not infrequently slighted, is 
to warn the girls and the girls’ parents of the dangers lurking 
in their way, and to keep an observant eye on those who are 
over-sexed or viciously inclined. 
This didactic instruction and advice should, however, be 
made as concrete and practical as possible. Liberal use 
should be made of anecdotes, stories, easily apprehended 
parables and fables, and illustrations of concrete or specific 
occurrences from the school and community. Examples are 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
  222 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
better than precepts; and precepts are better than abstract 
principles, formulas or ideals. 
(b) Habit formation. But better than any of these meth- 
ods is daily training in correct modes of behavior, in actually 
practicing or doing desirable deeds, and in forming fixed 
habits of response. Practicing is better than preaching. It 
is deeds, not professions or resolutions that count. Ethical 
enlightenment which does not eventuate in moral conduct is 
valueless. What the child thinks in private is of little social 
consequence, but his action becomes a matter of concern for 
every one. Some one has said that practical morality even 
in the case of the mass of people in the general population is 
ninety per cent instinct, habit, and custom. The vast major- 
ity of persons do the habitual and customary things — the 
things which are rooted in impulse and instinct, the things 
which have become routine habits, and the things which are 
sanctioned by the customs and conventions obtaining in 
their social milieu. They do not ordinarily act as the result 
of the careful weighing of motives and the deliberate con- 
sideration of the abstract ethical principles involved in any 
course of conduct. If this is true of people in general, as I 
believe it is, it is doubly true of defectives. Our main reli- 
ance in developing acceptable behavior in mental deficients 
must be not on didactic instruction, on promises, good inten- 
tions, resolutions, or even on “good-will,” but on habit 
formation, on expression rather than impression. Good 
conduct must be made a matter of habituation. The aim 
must be to build up dependable habits of response by train- 
ing the children day by day to actually do the right and the 
polite thing: to be punctual, give prompt obedience, talk 
distinctly, assist the weaker children, clean their shoes, tell 
the truth, etc. Too much stress cannot be laid on the im- 
portance of developing habits of promptness, industry, con- 
tinued application, and regularity. Many deficient children
-P-A-G-E-241
THE CURRICULUM AND THE TEACHER ~— 223 
lose their jobs because they come late, or because they are 
lacking in perseverance, and remain away when fancy 
strikes them. We must utilize all the psychological aids 
possible for doing this, particularly the basic principles of 
habit formation as formulated by James: initial focalization 
of consciousness, in order that the child may secure a clear, 
definite, and specific idea of the habit to be formed; attentive 
repetition, so that the habits may be correctly and expedi- 
tiously formed, and avoidance of exceptions during the con- 
tinuance of the practice until a stage of automatic control 
has been attained or approximated. 
Suggested aids in the discipline and moral training of de- 
fectives. The following suggestions will, it is believed, prove 
of value to the teacher in her attempt to develop the char- 
acter and improve the discipline and deportment of sub- 
normals: 
(a) The bestowal of commendation for the good the child 
does will focus his attention on desirable conduct, whereas 
reproof for evil deeds will direct attention to the proscriptions 
and the undesirable forms of behavior. According to the 
doctrine of ‘“‘dynamogeny,” ideas are ideomotor — that is, 
they tend to work themselves out into appropriate expres- 
sion. Hence we should rivet the child’s attention on desir- 
able deeds, the things we want him to do. Praise is very ef- 
fective in doing this. It is one of the major motivating 
forces. Most people do better under the stimulus of encour- 
agement. Pleasant stimuli energize and liberate; unpleasant 
experiences tend to depress and devitalize. 
(b) The bestowal of intrinsic or extrinsic rewards or prizes 
or special privileges for good conduct and the deprivation of 
privileges and the withholding of rewards for infractions of 
rules are, for similar reasons, very effective with subnormals. 
Little children and children with little minds need immedi- 
ate and tangible rewards. Give the child some recognition,
-P-A-G-E-242
  224 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
such as a mark, a red, blue, or gold star, a ribbon, a badge, a 
souvenir, an emblem, a tag, or a special privilege, or make 
him a “trusty” in recognition of good conduct. On the 
other hand, for misconduct deprive him of certain privileges, 
objects, or advantages which he greatly covets. In the insti- 
tutions the withholding of delicious foods (pie or ice cream) 
for bad conduct serves as a powerful corrective. The Vine- 
land Training School has for over fifteen years been using a 
system of “OK” credit slips, which has proved very effective 
with feeble-minded children. Each child is given his OK 
credit at the end of every period from every department to 
which he has been scheduled. In other words, he is given 
immediate recognition for good work done during every 
period or session. In case he has not earned his credit a hole 
is punched in the OK. At the end of the week the child 
goes to the institution store where he is given credit accord- 
ing to the number of OK’s or punched holes which he has re- 
ceived. He may make purchases in the store with credits, or 
deposit the credits for future purchases. Tickets bearing the 
inscription “good conduct pupil,” or some more appropriate 
designation, might be issued daily to the well-behaved pupils. 
The names of the pupils might be placed on the blackboard 
together with a star or mark for every five or ten tickets 
issued. 
(c) Suggestions should be used rather than commands, 
friendly guidance rather than coercion. Many children who 
will rebel at commands will respond willingly to suggestions, 
especially when conveyed in a pleasant, appealing voice. 
A categorical mandate tends to arouse animosity, resent- 
ment, opposition, and a desire to violate the injunction. 
Make the thing appear as a special privilege, and not an 
order. Moreover, a positive suggestion is more effective 
than a negative one, because of the dynamogenic tendency 
of ideas, as already explained. Concentration on a forbid-
-P-A-G-E-243
THE CURRICULUM AND THE TEACHER = 225 
den evil or wicked act will make it stand out more promi- 
nently in consciousness, and when the child is angry with 
you he will do the things you have emphasized as very bad. 
Make your suggestions convey the idea of what the child 
should do, rather than what he should not do. Fix in his 
mind the ideas of what things are good, desirable, and right. 
(d) The teacher will gain more by evidencing regret or 
sorrow, than by evidencing irritability and anger over the 
child’s misdeed. Anger arouses anger, while regret and com- 
miseration tend to arouse penitence and remorse. 
1e) Provide substitute activities for the child’s undesirable 
activities, substitute controlled movements for the uncon- 
trolled, or active occupations for aimless, random manipu- 
lations, and divert instinctive tendencies into fruitful chan- 
nels. If the child has a passion for whittling his desk, sub- 
stitute profitable forms of manual training for the aimless, 
destructive movements. If the child suffers from constant 
restlessness because of superabundant energy or nervous in- 
stability, substitute active occupations. If his acquisitive 
instinct leads him to misappropriate, let him collect, mount 
or preserve certain objects designated by the teacher. By 
carefully noting the children’s tendencies the teacher will be 
able to forestall outbreaks of restlessness by diverting the 
nervous explosiveness into fruitful channels of endeavor. 
If the teacher will take special pains to adapt the instruc- 
tion to the needs of the pupils and teach effectively, “disci- 
plinary bugbears” will probably be unknown in her class, as 
shown on pages 177-181. 
(f) By transforming the class into a bright, cheery, happy 
home, the atmosphere of cheer and confidence will largely 
take care of the problem of discipline. Do not set out to “have 
discipline at any cost,” but to create such an atmosphere in 
your classroom that good discipline will follow inevitably. 
(g) It is evident from what has been said that there will be  
-P-A-G-E-244
226 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
* little use for corporal punishment in the special schools. But 
I do not disapprove of its use as a last resort. It is far pre- 
ferable to a sarcastic tongue, which rankles and sears the 
soul, and is often more effective than scolding or reproof. 
Bad habits are sometimes speedily broken and good ones 
effectively formed by a shock. Pain has been the great in- 
hibitor, as pleasure has been the great stimulator, through- 
out the biological creation. Always appeal to the highest 
rational motives in molding children’s character — the 
supreme job of the teacher — to motives of right, duty, 
justice, honor, charity, and love — but use lower-level 
motives when the higher motives are ineffective. So train 
children that they will willingly act aright from rational con- 
siderations if possible. But if impossible, enforce good con- 
duct by recourse to mechanisms of control of a more primi- 
tive type. 
8. Literary or academic studies 
Value of literary instruction. It is often insisted that 
teaching even the basic academic branches, such as reading, 
numbers, spelling, writing, or composition, to mental defec- 
tives is a waste of time, because they do not acquire suffi- 
cient competency in any of the schoolroom arts to make any 
practical use of them. 
Competency of high-grade imbeciles in reading and num- 
bers. In the survey of the St. Louis special classes by stand- 
ardized educational tests we found that the teaching of read- 
ing and arithmetic to imbeciles or mental defectives who did 
not reach a mentality of about six years did not result in the 
acquisition of any useful form of skill. The highest grades 
of the imbeciles barely exceeded the zero point in the curve 
of competency in reading and numbers after six or seven 
years of school attendance. 
The potential capacity ef imbeciles for acquiring a mas-
-P-A-G-E-245
  THE CURRICULUM AND THE TEACHER = 227 
tery of the rudiments of the literary instruction may be con- 
cretely illustrated by very brief citations from three case 
records. We shall begin with the least competent child. 
D. H., an exceedingly erratic, restless, and flighty Jewish boy, 
had a Binet-Simon age of 4.2 by the 1911 at the age of 9.58, giving 
an I.Q. of 44, a psychomotor age of 4.5 according to the Seguin 
form-board (writer’s norms), and a Stanford-Binet age of 4.3 at the 
age of 13, 1.Q. 33, and a psychomotor level of six years. He en- 
tered the grade school at the age of six and a half, and the special a 
year later, from which he was excluded twice before being finally 
eliminated in his thirteenth year. At the age of 12.4, when he had 
been in school about four years, the special report from the school 
indicated that he was fair in kindergarten work but flighty, that he 
had very little capacity in sawing and nailing, that he would not 
apply himself to garden activities, that he was fair in spool knitting, 
crude in drawing for self-expression, had little power for writing, 
was able to get a few ideas in story telling and able to repeat them, 
had no conception of number or size, had learned to recognize on 
the board the words I, can, see, run, hop, jump, ball, roll, the, is, 
play, blue, red, and, my, little, boy, am, girl, baby, pretty, like, fly, 
kitty, and was able to read two pages of print from a primer. He 
was observant but unstable and could not concentrate. His great- 
est improvement was in conduct. When examined by the writer at 
the age of 13, he was restless and inattentive. He repeated 9 2 as 
192,25 as 125, but later repeated two digits correctly. He failed 
to count 13 pennies correctly although he had done so more than 
three years before. A hen and cow had two legs each, a horse two, 
but this was later changed to three, a dog three, a girl three, and a 
boy four at first and then three. But he had two legs. “I can run” 
was read from a printed page as “I see... can”; “I can hop” as 
“Tsee...k...;and “Iamaboy” as “k, es b, e, know I, c.”” When 
asked to spell cat he said “and cat,” but after I had spelled it, he 
said “cnrcat.” Rat was spelled as “‘c n coupled cat,” but after I 
had spelled it for him, as “n..... cat.” (He had had little 
formal instruction in spelling.) “One apple and one more apple” 
made three apples. ‘‘Two pennies and two more pennies” made 
two, and then three pennies. When the pennies were placed thus 
0.0 00 on the table he finally counted them correctly. When five 
pennies were placed thus 0 0 0 0 0 he said there were two. When
-P-A-G-E-246
  228 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
asked to count them he pushed the pennies aside singly and gave 
the correct number. The sentence “See little Paul” in script was 
copied thus:

The school report at the end of the school year, when he was al- 
most thirteen and a half, showed that he took no interest in tag, 
ball, or running games, he was poor in floor, ladder, and suspension 
work, he showed no judgment in calisthenic work, he had made 
slight improvement in running, tactic, and apparatus work, he 
would not touch clay unless forced to do so, he had learned to pick 
up the stitch in cross stitching, he showed more interest and had 
improved slightly in handwork, he had not learned to write, he 
could count to five and write figures to four. The educational 
results with unstable imbeciles of this grade are, as seen, very 
meager. 
O. R., an exceedingly placid and stable boy but lacking in vital 
force and having a very indistinct articulation, was admitted into a 
special class at the age of 7.8, at which time he had a Binet-Simon 
age of 3.4, I.Q. 46, by the 1911 scale. He was excluded within 
three months as ineducable, but readmitted somewhat over a year 
later in deference to the parents’ entreaties; and was still continu- * 
ing in the special at the time of my leaving, having made percepti- 
ble progress in manual work but only slight progress in the literary 
studies. At the age of 10.7 years he was able to read a few familiar 
words and short phrases by sight, and could copy words and sen- 
tences, but his penmanship was poor, as may be seen from the fol- 
lowing sample of writing which he copied laboriously from the 
board:

L. D., jovial, talkative, usually well-behaved, but unstable, er- 
ratic, and sometimes obstreperous, entered school in his sixth year, 
and was excluded when 16.5 for an alleged attempt to tamper with 
a young girl. He had a mental level of 6.4 according to the 1911 
Binet-Simon at the age of 12.8, giving an I.Q. of 50, and a psycho- 
motor age of 4.5 (Seguin), and a level of seven years according to 
the Stanford-Binet at the age of 16.2, giving an I.Q. of 43, and a 
similar psychomotor age. At the age of 15.5 the school report 
indicated that he had no ability in woodwork, raffia, or gardening; 
he showed no judgment in gardening, “‘just as soon pulling plants 
as weeds”; he was very crude in writing and drawing; was fair in 
knitting wash cloths, had improved a little in reading, doing about 
I-3 in reading and spelling; he was very much interested in oral 
language work and dramatization, having improved considerably 
in this work, but was flighty in expression; he had learned to count 
beyond one hundred, could recognize and write numbers and solve 
very simple problems, and he had learned to march in step.
-P-A-G-E-248

At the age of sixteen he scored 1 per cent in a written test of 
Starch’s second spelling test, and six per cent in an oral test of the 
same words, which is below the first-grade standard. In Ayres 
test A he scored 100 per cent, in B 75 per cent, in C 100 per cent, in 
D 44 per cent, and in E 29 per cent, which is below the second- 
grade standard. ‘Two months later he read correctly from an un- 
familiar text, “I have an apple” and “I see the sun,” although he 
had great difficulty in recognizing the last word. He read all ex- 
cept “arrow” in “It isa bow and arrow.” He wrote correctly from 
dictation, “See the baby,” which happened to be old material. In 
“Can you row the boat?” he left out row and for boat wrote “uown.”” 
In “The dog fights the cat,” he left out fights the and inserted “ma.” 
When asked to “write a story” he wrote: “I see a little baby.” 
Urged to “go on,” he wrote: “I see a pritty is baby?” When 
again urged to go on, he wrote: “I see Like and athe ” Effort to 
induce him to relate what he had written failed. In oral arith- 
metic he gave the following answers, many equivalent expressions 
being used to indicate the correct process (for example, ‘ “two and 
two are how many?” “two and two more,” “two plus two,” “add 
two to two.”)

question, he first replied “twelve” and then “eighteen.” I then 
asked L. to divide the pile into two equal piles. This he did cor- 
rectly, but said he had five in each pile, even after he had examined 
the piles carefully. He solved correctly the problems, “If I give 
you 5¢ to-day and three times as much to-morrow, how much will

and 4 apples X 2 apples evoked the answers 10, 15, and 9 apples, 
respectively. 
Here is a boy who would not rate lower than a high-grade imbecile 
who had barely acquired control of the most rudimentary pro- 
cesses of reading, writing, and figuring, and who had made very 
little progress in the manual arts. But it should not be forgotten 
that he belonged to the unstable type of defective. Stable defec- 
tives of this intelligence level usually make considerably greater 
progress, especially in handwork. 
Mitchell’s, Goddard’s, and Woodrow’s opinions. David 
Mitchell considers that no academic work at all should be 
taught children who grade as “middle-grade imbeciles” (in 
Barr’s classification) or lower, while Goddard holds that the 
three R’s “are almost entirely out of place with children who 
are mentally defective,” obviously including even the highest- 
grade cases. H. Woodrow holds that instruction is useless in 
arithmetic beyond “addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
division, and very simple fractions” if the child’s I.Q. is be- 
low 70, and useless in reading if the I.Q. is below 40. 
Competency of high-grade feeble-minded in reading. It 
is a fact that even the highest grades of mental defectives, 
assuming that they have been properly classified, do not 
make any considerable practical use of the literary skills 
they have acquired. Many children of this grade master the 
mechanics of reading fairly well up to about the beginning of 
the third-grade level of competency. A few possess special 
ability in reading, and read more difficult matter with great 
fluency. Most, however, rate considerably lower on content 
reading than word-calling. They are unable to “husk 
thoughts” from the printed page if the subject-matter is at 
all involved. Moreover, few seem to acquire the desire or 
the permanent habit of reading. Martha Lindley, in investi-
-P-A-G-E-250
  282 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
gating the reading habits of children in the Vineland Train- 
ing School over twelve years of age who had been taught to 
read, found that only 25 per cent “still read to some extent, 
and only 12 per cent did so voluntarily.” od included 5.2 
per cent of those with an eight-year mentality, and 23 per 
cent of those with a nine-year mentality. Sixty-eight per 
cent of the readers had mentalities of ten and eleven. She 
concluded that only those reaching the latter mentalities 
should receive attention in reading, a conclusion which, 
based on the army results, could not be applied to extra-in- 
stitutional deficients. 
Competency in arithmetic. In number work practically 
all of the higher grades can be trained to count, and some 
can master the mechanics of figuring or ciphering. Our re- 
sults, based on standardized tests, showed that they are 
most competent in addition, and least competent in fractions 
and division, although some learn to repeat the multiplica- 
tion tables quite glibly. Many do fairly well with simple 
concrete problems, such as measuring, buying, and selling, 
provided the conditions are not changed. It has been noted 
that a mentally defective farm hand who has no trouble in 
giving the horses the right number of ears of corn may be 
unable to pick out an equal number of age or potatoes. 
Many of those who become newsboys or fruit vendors ac- 
quire considerable knack in making change with the coins 
usually handed them. But few can solve problems of any 
degree of complexity — they do not know which process to 
use, or lose trail of the problem and so get the processes con- 
fused — or they are not able clearly to conceive or envisage 
abstract numerical relations, or acquire clear-cut abstract 
number concepts, so as to be able to abstract and generalize. 
Competency in penmanship and composition. Many 
learn to write a fairly readable style of penmanship, and 
some can write simple sentences or phrases correctly. But

tion and arithmetic of any of the literary subjects usually 
taught in the special classes. 
Overemphasis on literary training. It is undeniably true 
that mentally deficient school children throughout the coun- 
try are overinstructed in the literary branches. This is not 
only true of those who are in the regular grades — and most 
probably still remain in the grades — but of the majority of 
those who are in the special classes. The programs in many 
special classes are essentially patterned after the regular 
grade curricula, except that more elasticity is permitted and 
more emphasis is placed on motor forms of training. But the 
motor work is injected more as a supplement to the orthodox 
academic branches than as a major integral part of the pro- 
gram. 
It would be possible, therefore, to improve the instruction 
in the special schools by devoting some of the time now given 
to the academic branches to more profitable forms of train- 
ing. 
Shall we eliminate all literary instruction? While it is 
true that the mentally deficient make little progress in the lit- 
erary branches, yet I do not for a moment advocate the com- 
plete suppression of all literary instruction for such children. 
The attempt to do this would arouse too much hostility to- 
ward the special classes on the part of many parents, who 
insist that their children must be given literary training, and 
in the event that they are refused such training in the spe- 
cials, that they be returned to the grades where such advan- 
tages are available. This is largely because they believe that 
the literary instruction possesses more value as mental dis- 
cipline than the handwork and because they want the child’s 
illiteracy eradicated if possible, since this, in their opinion, 
more effectively stigmatizes the child than any other defect. 
Moreover, the literary instruction, apart from any disciplin- 
ary value which it may have — and we cannot affirm dog-
-P-A-G-E-256
  238 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
matically that this value is nil — and apart from the enjoy- 
ment which it sometimes affords even to edie who can- 
not attain any considerable degree of literary mastery, is 
not entirely devoid of intrinsic value for the mentally defi- 
cient. It does lead to the development of a few skills of 
practical value, and does give a slight command of certain 
literary tools which are basic instruments of control in civil- 
ized society and which will render the mentally deficient 
slightly more efficient, human, and happy. While the chief 
emphasis in the training of even the higher grades of mental 
defectives and the borderline should be placed on the devel- 
opment of useful forms of manual and industrial skill and 
proper habits of moral and social response, there is justifica- 
tion for devoting a reasonable amount of time to the basic 
literary branches, namely reading (in the first instance), 
spelling, writing, composition, oral language, arithmetic, 
local geography, and nature study. 
Character of literary instruction. But this instruction 
must be vitalized by being orally, visually, and concretely 
presented, and by being profusely correlated with the child’s 
interests and activities in and out of school. The “set” 
instruction must be enlivened by incidental “information 
talks” and “object lessons” on many subjects of practical 
value to defectives, who must adjust themselves to life situ- 
ations either in homes or institutions. The regular literary 
instruction should be largely confined to the rudiments, to 
the elements which come within the children’s range of com- 
prehension and have the greatest practical “‘instrumental” 
utility. 
Methods and aims of teaching reading. In the teaching 
of reading use should be made of cut-out ona words, and 
phrases (for matching), elevated or depressed letters (for 
supplementing the visual with tactual impressions), black- 
board and chart work, the use of illustrated elementary
-P-A-G-E-257
    THE CURRICULUM AND THE TEACHER = 239 
readers and story-books in abundance,! and loose sheet 
readers constructed by the pupils and teacher in the class in 
which the “stories” recount the children’s experiences at 
the time in the class and in the home, the use of pictures and 
games, and a great variety of the recognized methods of 
teaching reading (the alphabetic, syllabic, word, sentence, 
phonic, phonogrammic, rhyming action words and sen- 
tences, dramatization, flash exposures, etc.) While the word 
and sentence method in connection with the use of illus- 
trative material and motor expression (dramatization, writ- 
ing words, and pronouncing phonic elements and words) 
will probably prove to be best for most of these pupils, other 
methods (even the archaic alphabetic or syllabic) will prove 
superior in exceptional cases. Although the aims of reading 
instruction are the same for the subnormal as for the normal 
— namely, developing the power to instantly recognize the 
printed symbols, to pronounce or read the words orally with 
fluency and expression, to extract the thought from the 
printed page, to secure pleasure and information from read- 
ing, and to acquire a taste for good reading — the first con- 
cern in teaching reading to mental defectives must be to 
develop a reading vocabulary for the common terms which 
may be expected to occur in their daily social and vocational 
contacts, including the automatic recognition of the words 
and the interpretation of the thought of matter within their 
range of reading ability and comprehension, and to train 
them to read and understand notices, street signs, street-car 
signs, figures, the months and days of the week on a calen- 
dar, the time of day, orders, bills, their signature, and the 
like. 
Oral and written language instruction. In the language 
1 The gradation of difficulty advances too rapidly in the ordinary readers, 
which are made for normal children. Hence there is great need for supple- 
mentary reading material which will fit the child’s level of attainment.
-P-A-G-E-258
      
  240 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED C: 
work the aim should be to increase the child’s vocabulary; to 
train him to listen carefully to spoken words, so that he will 
perceive the sounds accurately ; to develop fluent, melodious, 
properly modulated, correct, idiomatic, and clear expression; 
to correct slovenly, drawling, slurring, indistit ct, inarticu- 
late forms of pronunciation, or speech defects; to habituate 
the child in the use of polite and courteous forms of conver- 
sational speech; to train him to write a legible hand, social 
and business letters, orders, bills, and checks; to properly 
spell, capitalize, and punctuate his written work; and to en- 
large his thoughts. The language lessons should be based on 
all of the child’s interests and activities, in and out of school, 
including the observations made on the industrial trips. In 
addition to incidental instruction in spelling given in con- 
nection with the reading and language work, two or three 
words may be assigned per day for special study or drill by 
the method described in the writer’s Spelling Efficiency, 
which has proved effective in practice. L. P. Ayres’s list of 
one thousand frequently used words will supply an excellent 
nucleus of words for the spelling instruction. 
Arithmetic instruction. The number work should be thor- 
oughly humanized and made an agent of utility in the class- 
room. It should be buttressed on the child’s concrete activ- 
ities in the schoolroom and correlated with all the activities 
in which number and magnitude are involved. It should 
emerge from the kindergarten and sensori-motor activities, 
plays, and games which will afford abundant opportunities 
for counting, adding to and taking away, noting differences 
in size, shape, and arrangement or serial order. The child 
should be trained to count, read figures, including small frac- 
tions, read and understand the ordinary mathematical signs 
and abbreviations, and acquire some dexterity in the use of 
the fundamental processes. He should learn how to record 
numerical data, and to make out an account. He should be
-P-A-G-E-259
THE CURRICULUM AND THE TEACHER 241 
required to apply the various mathematical processes to the 
solution of the problems which confront him daily in the 
school. Problems should be selected which are similar to 
those he will meet after leaving school. The exercises should 
include buying and selling in the school store, measuring, 
reading, and recording the results of measuring with the 
bushel, quart, pint, gallon, foot rule, yard stick, tape line, 
and scales. He should also be trained to judge or estimate 
distances and magnitudes. 
4. Sensori-motor, manual, industrial arts, pre-vocational and 
vocational training 
Meaning of sense culture. It is not a process of perfect- 
ing or refining the sense organs, although it may render the 
nervous pathways more permeable and thus improve con- 
ductivity or transmissibility. Its chief value is mental. It 
develops what may be called the child’s “sensory conscious- 
ness.” Sense training, if properly conducted, should in- 
crease the speed, accuracy, and range of observation. It 
should enable the child to discriminate better between stim- 
uli, to notice smaller differences, to acquire facts about 
stimuli, to compare the facts, to form accurate concepts, and 
to draw correct inferences and conclusions from the facts 
compared, to classify facts, arrange them in orderly se- 
quence, and apply correct names to the facts observed. One 
of the most important objectives of sense training is to de- 
velop the habit of systematic and methodical observation. 
Need of sensori-motor training. The normal child may 
secure all the sensori-motor training which he requires from 
his plays, games, playful occupations, and inveterate experi- 
menting. The low-grade mental defective, the young men- 
tally deficient child, and the child with special sensory or 
motor defects must have such experience or training thrust 
upon him.
-P-A-G-E-260
  242 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
Types of training to be given. A considerable amount of 
sensori-motor training can be given incidentally in connec- 
tion with the games and plays, the exercises of practical life, 
the shop work, the manual training, in fact in connection 
with the training in all the arts and crafts. But young or low 
grade defectives should be given a certain amount of formal 
“sense training,” particularly so far as relates to the visual, 
auditory and kinesthetic senses, formal motor training, and 
kindergarten gifts and occupations, including exercises in 
noting resemblances, differences, and contrasts, noting 
smaller and smaller differences, matching forms and colors, 
constructing patterns with colored beads, colored splints, 
colored pegs (using the peg boards) and block building, and 
the like. The Montessori sense training appar atus can be 
advantageously used as a supplement. 
Practical suggestions. Choose materials which will inter- 
est the child, which are used in play activities and adult oc- 
cupations, which afford sharp contrasts, which can be easily 
handled and manipulated, which are durable, sanitary, and 
easily cleaned, and which can be arranged in graded and 
progressive series. It is important to emphasize that the 
training of the sensory and motor functions should go hand 
in hand. Sense training and muscle training should not be 
divorced. The child should not sit passively staring at ob- 
jects, or passively listening. He should be permitted to 
touch things, and manipulate objects in a constructive way. 
Observation and response have gone together all through 
the history of the race. The unit of nervous action is the 
sensori-motor arc. Manipulating objects enriches know- 
ledge and creates problematic situations to motivate the 
child’s activities. Finally much repetition will be needed 
with defectives, for which reason it is necessary to arrange 
the exercises in progressive steps in order to avoid the waste 
which comes from repeating identical exercises, and to
-P-A-G-E-261
THE CURRICULUM AND THE TEACHER 243 
appeal to the element of rivalry or contest by introducing 
group exercises. 
Industrial arts training. The shop and industrial arts 
training should include the following activities, according to 
the equipment available and the requirements of each child, 
based on his level of development, special capacities or tal- 
ents, predilections, and vocational interests: 
Paper work: including cutting, folding, cutting out pic- 
tures, mounting, coloring, poster or panel work, construct- 
ing various articles, modeling in pasteboard, making crépe 
paper flowers, table and room decorations, and costumes. 
Plastic art: work in clay, plasticine, wax, sealing wax, 
cement, culminating in concrete work of various kinds, col- 
ored in petroma (which does not require firing), pottery, and 
faience. 
Weaving: raffia, reed, cane, and paper rope weaving, in- 
cluding the weaving of mats, trays, baskets of various kinds, 
including Indian baskets,! vases, lamp shades, floor lamps, 
and ferneries; and chair caning. 
Loom and cord work: hand loom and foot loom weaving, 
cardboard loom weaving, spool knitting, rake knitting, rug 
making (braided and crocheted), braiding, netting, knot- 
ting, cord work, macramé, hammock making. 
Sewing, hand and machine: making various kinds of 
stitches; sewing on buttons, hooks and eyes, cutting, tailor- 
ing; making counterpanes, sewing bags, kitchen aprons, 
outing flannel petticoats, caps, middy blouses, bloomers, 
dresses, undergarments, and mending and renovating gar- 
ments. 
Knitting, darning, crocheting, embroidering, lace-making, 
and millinery. 
Woodwork: making simple objects, scroll-saw work, toy- 
1 Willow baskets have considerable utilitarian value, but are difficult to 
make.
-P-A-G-E-262
  244 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
making, carpentry, furniture making and repairing, includ- 
ing upholstering; making tables, boxes, benches, stands, 
tabourets, wooden waste baskets, knife boxes, broom hold- 
ers, brush backs, book or magazine racks, bird houses, in a 
profusion of styles, hat racks, costumers, bookcases, medi- 
cine cabinets, frames for reed furniture and table and floor 
lamps, rattan furniture, and steamer chairs. 
Brush making: nail, shoe, scrub, cloth, and duster brushes. 
Metal work: bent-iron work, repoussé work, beaten copper 
work; tin can constructions. 
Free-hand drawing and sketching: coloring, filling in out- 
lines in appropriate colors, stencil design work, including the 
making of stencils in stencil paper. | 
Leatherwork: cobbling, flat modeling and embossing, cut 
work, and making objects. 
Practical training for home service: this should be based 
on the performance of service in the special schools, includ- 
ing the cleaning of floors, windows, gas ranges, cabinets, 
closets, ice boxes, and furniture; sweeping, wiping, dusting, 
washing, and wiping and taking care of dishes and kitchen 
utensils; laundering; the proper preparation and serving of 
meals and lunches; instruction in regard to balanced meals 
and food requirements; the growing of vegetables in the 
school garden; canning vegetables; the outfitting of a large 
doll, in connection with instruction on the care of the 
baby. | 
Training for specific jobs or trades will not be amiss in the 
industrial centers if the facilities are supplied. 
In Detroit the older, high-grade boys are transferred to 
special centers where they are taught auto-repairing, bench 
work, wood turning, lathe work, rough carpentry, drafting, 
reading blue-prints, and household mechanics (for example, 
removing sashes, hanging doors and shades, led locks, 
utensils, and furniture, renewing dead cells, inserting exten-

THE CURRICULUM AND THE TEACHER 245 
sion cords, wiring, reading meters, adjusting faucets). The 
older girls get simple commercial sewing, laundry work, 
cooking, and training in the regular school cafeterias. 
Reasons for emphasizing motor training. As already sug- 
gested, the major emphasis in the curriculum for defectives 
must be placed on the motor forms of training rather than 
on the literary forms of training for various reasons. 
(1) The child is fundamentally a motor being. He is 
motor a long time before he becomes intellectual. Move- 
ment rests on an instinctive, impulsive basis — it is an ir- 
resistible impulse — while cogitation is an artifact thrust on 
the child by the exigencies of civilization. Movement satis- 
fies a fundamental biological need. 
(2) It is through movements that the child acquires a 
knowledge of the world. Movements bring him into inti- 
mate contact with his surroundings. Movements of the 
hands (and in early life of the lips also) enable him to explore 
objects. It is from these kinesthetic sensations that the 
child gets his vital, pulsating, trustworthy knowledge of 
reality. He does not actually know what a ball is until he 
has handled one and obtained a host of new sensations: hard- 
ness, smoothness, resilience, elasticity, ability to roll and 
rebound, coldness, heaviness, etc. When there is conflict 
between the different senses, the appeal is always made to 
the kinesthetic sensations: that which is capable of offering 
resistance to muscular exertion must be real. 
(3) Motor education affords excellent mental training. 
It offers opportunities to compare, judge, analyze problems, 
solve new problems, adapt means to ends, and codrdinate 
movements toward the attainment of desired objectives. 
Just as motor education consists most largely in the develop- 
ment and refinement of muscular codrdinations, so intellec- 
tual education consists largely in establishing associations 
between related ideas and in properly codrdinating various 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
er et rer ere 
246 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
mental processes. Knowledge is a system of correctly co- 
ordinated or related ideas. 
(4) Motor training actually gives results, Experience 
shows that the mentally deficient are benefited more by 
motor, industrial arts and occupational training than by lit- 
erary instruction. 
5. Opening exercises or assemblies 
The opening exercises can, if properly planned, be made 
to yield rich cultural returns in the special classes. They 
afford opportunities for assembling all the pupils of the 
school, and for building up a wholesome esprit de corps for 
beginning the work of the day on a very high plane; for 
enabling the teachers to give “inspirational talks” with a 
view to arousing aspirations in the children to live lives of 
noble service, talks on etiquette, morals, manners, good be- 
havior, character-formation, patriotism, physical and men- 
tal hygiene, current events, important happenings, the sig- 
nificance of special holidays; for allowing the pupils to enjoy

ment, to declaim, recite memory gems, whistle, sing, or play

6. Speech correction | 
The teacher of the special class must devote much time to 
speech improvement and the correction of speech defects (of 
the uncomplicated type, such as indistinct articulation, lisp- 
ing, lalling, defective phonation) because so many of the 
pupils are subject to slovenly, inarticulate, defective, and 
incorrect speech. In our survey of speech defects:in the St. 
Louis schools it was found that 26.3 per cent of the pupils in 
the special schools for the mentally defective (which, how-

7 Music 
Most of the mentally deficient enjoy music, especially 
the rhythm, the quick staccato tempos, and simple familiar 
airs. Many possess considerable musical ability. Some can 
hum tunes who cannot read the words; some possess good 
voices and sing correctly in tune; some can learn to play easy 
selections on the piano, mouth harp, or different band instru- 
ments. Because of the musical ability possessed by some of 
these children the parents find it difficult to accept the exam- 
iner’s verdict that they are feeble-minded. 
Musically inclined imbeciles. HH. D., who had spastic paralysis 
in the left leg, impaired vision, internal strabismus, at the age of 12 
years had a mental age of 4.4 by the 1911 scale. She had acquired 
very little in school after three years of discontinuous instruction, 
but she could hum tunes, and play simple melodies on the piano by 
ear. She was able to learn the words to many popular airs and sing 
them fairly well. The mother protested against the diagnosis of 
imbecility. F. C., a male imbecile with partial motor aphasia and 
a mentality of less than four at the age of 13.5, who could with 
effort repeat words fairly well but who talked in grunts and mum- 
bles, was exceedingly fond of music, was able to hum a considerable 
number of tunes from memory, and partook with gusto in the sing- 
ing in the Sunday school. D. B., a very excitable, restless girl sub- 
ject to athetosis, and having a mentality of three at the age of eight, 
sang catchy tunes readily, was very fond of the graphophone, and

e disks she enjoyed and place them on the in- 
gh she could not read a word. 
sic. A special class without vocal and instru- 
Fausic is almost an anachronism. Music should be 
ed in abundance, not only for the sake of furnishing 
Yoyment to the children, but for purposes of training. It 
& a superior medium for arousing attention, energizing the 
child’s activities, developing motor codrdination and grace, 
training the voice, improving the articulation, developing a 
group consciousness, socializing the child, and providing 
esthetic culture. 
Apportionment of time to the various activities. It is 
manifestly unwise to attempt to lay down inflexible rules 
regarding the relative amount of time to devote to the dif- 
ferent branches. One of the essential requirements of 
special-class work is that the program must be flexible so 
that the work may be adjusted to the needs of each pupil. 
However, for the average mentally defective child we would 
recommend that the time be apportioned about as follows: 
physical training, 10 per cent; literary branches, 35 per cent; 
industrial arts training, 35 per cent; opening exercises, 9 per 
cent; intermissions, 8 per cent; and formal sensori-motor 
training, 3 per cent. It must be distinctly emphasized that 
these divisions merely represent general tendencies. Low- 
grade children should be given more formal sensori-motor 
training and manual work because they acquire few useful 
literary skills, while children with ability in the literary 
branches should be given more academic training. Asa rule 
more time should be devoted to developing a child’s talents 
than to overcoming his conspicuous defects, which fre- 
quently respond poorly to corrective or remedial treatment 
in the mentally defective. Of course, children above the 
level of feeble-mindedness should give more time to the lit- 
erary studies.

II. Quauirications NEEDED By THE TEACHER OF THE 
Mentatty Dericient 
The special-class teacher needs the qualifications required 
by all good teachers: “A rich personality, human sympathy, 
insight, and scholarship,” and we would add, faithfulness to 
her trust and loyalty to the constituted authorities. There 
are, however, certain traits or qualifications which are 
needed in superlative degree by the teacher of the mentally 
deficient. What are these qualifications? 
1. The special-class teacher must possess a good fund of 
buoyancy, optimism, and sympathy. She should grade 100 
per cent plus on humanity, patience, and cheerfulness. For- 
tunate is the teacher if she is constitutionally euphoric and 
patient. Otherwise she must assiduously cultivate these 
traits, for she will be dealing with pupils who have been 
“trigging the wheels,” whose minds work very slowly, list- 
lessly, and reluctantly, and who, even when they try their 
very best, cannot catch up with the normal rate. The im- 
patient teacher will chafe under their slow, laborious rate of 
progress, and may become rigorous, petulant, and cross. 
The special-class teacher must be able to exercise self-con- 
trol. She must keep a “firm hand on the governor.” She 
must be able to meet defeat and disappointment with a 
smile, and with a resolve to return to the task with renewed 
determination. She must be able to get joy and inspiration 
from small accomplishments and promises of success. A 
sunny disposition will enable the teacher to laugh away her 
difficulties. Her radiant smiles will prove to be a veritable 
“open sesame” to the soul of the child, and will do more than 
anything else to melt icebergs of indifference or break down 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
250 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
barriers of hostility. The answer to the query at the Vine- 
land Training School, “Do you belong?” is a smile. The 
contagion of a smile is irresistible among children and even 
among grown-ups. Certainly these children, who may have 
become diffident, discouraged, gloomy, or pessimistic be- 
cause of their past failures, deserve a bright, cheerful teacher, 
filled with the milk of human kindness, who can be a good 
materfamilias, or at least a good substitute for a mother, to 
them, and who can bring them out of their slough of despond. 
It is easy for teachers to adore children who are beautiful 
and lovable, but it may not be so easy to sympathize with 
those who, because of defects for which they are in no wise 
responsible, are not distinguished for pulchritude or amia- — 
bility. In order to be able to sympathize with such children 
the teacher must have imaginative insight. To appreciate 
the children’s condition, she must be able to exchange réles 
with them. But this is no easy matter in the absence of the 
necessary background of information concerning the child. 
This information which the teacher should possess should 
include: 
(1) A knowledge of the child’s physical condition, past and 
present. Recognition of the existence of physical handicaps 
will often temper one’s judgment and modify one’s attitude 
toward a child. We will assume quite another attitude 
toward a child we cannot teach to read when we discover 
that he is a victim of serious diplopia. A summary of the 
findings from the physical examination should be made avail- 
able to the teacher. 
(2) Information regarding the child’s mental status, or 
intelligence level, which is even more important as it will 
frequently supply the key to the child’s inability to make 
favorable educational progress. This information will 
greatly influence the teacher’s expectations and modify her 
procedure. Best of all, perhaps, it will enable her to explain
-P-A-G-E-269
  
THE CURRICULUM AND THE TEACHER 251 
why the child is not making greater progress, to parents who 
may be clamoring because the child has not been restored to 
grade, and who frequently cannot see that the child’s limita- 
tions are primarily to blame. Whenever possible the teacher 
should secure an independent judgment of the child’s mental 
status. Parents will be more convinced if they obtain the 
corroborative testimony of a competent, disinterested psy- 
chological examiner. In fact, they are entitled to expert ad- 
vice before important action is taken affecting the welfare of 
their child. 
(3) Knowledge of the significant facts in the child’s history 
or development, including diseases, accidents, privations, 
neglect, abuse, pampering, overstimulation, social and edu- 
cational advantages, schools attended, habits of eating, sleep- 
ing, playing, and working; home and neighborhood condi- 
tions; the mental and moral status of siblings, parents, and 
relatives; and the like. Such data may be secured from the 
school’s visiting teacher, social worker, nurse, attendance 
officer or bureau of tests and examinations, or from the char- 
ity organizations’ clearing houses or confidential exchange. 
Or the mothers may be asked to come to school to confer 
with the teacher, or the teacher may make personal visits to 
the home for observation, interview, establishing cordial 
relations, and giving instruction in the proper care of the 
child and the home. The view is frequently expressed that 
home visits should become an integral part of the special- 
class teacher’s work. Such visits are often productive of 
beneficial results to the child and to society. 
All information confidential. Information secured about 
the child should be regarded as sacredly confidential. It is 
not to be bandied about or proclaimed from the housetops. 
A teacher has no more right to reveal such information than 
a physician has to divulge confidential or privileged informa- 
tion (any information revealed by the patient to the physi-
-P-A-G-E-270
252 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
cian “which was necessary to enable him to prescribe or act 
for the patient’’), which constitutes an indictable offense. 
Some psychological examiners, to avoid complications, con- 
sistently decline to give out diagnoses or intimate facts 
learned about the child, limiting themselves to a bare state- 
ment of the test findings, an enumeration of the physical 
defects, and the necessary recommendations. 
2. The special-class teacher must be energetic, robust, 
physically strong, healthy, and nervously stable. These 
qualifications are now stressed in admitting students to the 
training schools in practically all of the large municipalities. 
The special-school teacher should possess these traits, not so 
much perhaps because the work is arduous and exacting — 
although if the training is adapted to the capacities of the 
pupils, the work may be made even less grinding than the 
teaching of forty or fifty children of varying ability in the 
regular grades — but because a high-strung, emotional, tem- 
peramental, neurotic teacher is a very bad antidote for high- 
strung, emotional, temperamental, neurotic children. Most 
nervously unstable people talk too much; they suffer from a 
mild logorrhea, and find difficulty in inhibiting the impulse 
to “rattle on.” Moreover, many are inclined to be non- 
sympathetic and irritable, or at least frequently convey 
such an impression. 
; 8. That the successful special-class teacher must be able 
skillfully to individualize her instruction and adapt it to the 
needs of each pupil needs no further emphasis. But it is 
necessary to stress that this desideratum cannot be attained 
unless the teacher not only possesses knowledge and insight, 
but unless she is “psychologically minded” and possesses a 
clinical attitude, so that she will be capable of intelligently 
observing, studying, comprehending and interpreting the 
mental peculiarities and reactions of each child. To be com- 
petent to perform this service, the teacher needs more than
-P-A-G-E-271
THE CURRICULUM AND THE TEACHER = 253 
mere knowledge of abstract psychological principles. She 
may possess a mastery of the abstract science of human be- 
havior without being able to apply her theoretical knowl- 
edge to the problem of analyzing, directing, and controlling 
the behavior of concrete cases. Some teachers possess intui- 
tive knowledge of human nature, or natural aptitude for 
understanding and interpreting human relations. They are 
born psychologists. But the majority must acquire psycho- 
logical insight from experience and from appropriate clinical 
training — from actually testing, observing, studying, and 
analyzing individual children, and from direct, first-hand 
contact with numerous types of defectives. Some persons 
never become “clinically minded” or acquire the “psycho- 
logizing attitude” in spite of superior training. However, 
the superior special-class teacher will be essentially a clinical 
teacher. 
4. She must be capable of remaining plastic, adaptable, 
and resourceful, and avoid falling into a rut, or a fixed rou- 
tine of instruction and discipline. This follows as a neces- 
sary consequence from what has already been said. The 
regular grade teacher, because of the size of the class, the 
numerous subjects which must be taught, and the standard- 
ized requirements which must be fulfilled, finds it difficult to 
avoid lock-stepping, mechanizing and routinizing her teach- 
ing and discipline. The special-class teacher must be able 
to resist the hypnotic lure of the fixed, formal technique of 
mass instruction, in order to respect the individuality of the 
child and retain that “individual touch” and individualiza- 
tion of training and discipline which has been accepted as 
essential for successful special-class work. 
5. As a corollary, the special-class teacher should be pos- 
sessed of a certain attitude as an important prerequisite. 
She must be interested in work of a non-routine, problem- 
solving nature. She must be eager in her desire to unravel
-P-A-G-E-272
  254 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
the problem of problem pupils and to help them solve their 
difficulties. These pupils are sent to her for the very reason 
that they have proved to be insuperable problems in the 
regular grades. The special-class teacher must enjoy wrest- 
ling with new problems, and working out new adjustments 
and solutions. She will possess the spirit of the true investi- 
gator, who receives his highest inspiration and reward from 
the new facts he has discovered and the difficulties he has 
overcome by improved methods. 
6. Before entering upon her work, the special-class teacher 
should have pursued an adequate course of special training. 
She should come into the service as a specialist and not as a 
bungling amateur. The skillful training of exceptional 
children is essentially the work of a specialist, and not of an 
untrained dilettante. It is not sufficient that the teacher be 
adaptable, interested in the work, sympathetic, possessed of 
good general ability, and have proved successful in the 
grades, especially the lower grades. These qualifications, on 
the basis of which teachers were selected during the early 
stages of the work, are excellent so far as they go. But they 
do not confer upon the teacher any miraculous insight into 
the condition and needs of defective children, nor endow her 
with the technical skill required to properly treat specific 
disabilities or unusual mental conditions. Undoubtedly the 
untrained teacher of intelligence can acquire competency 
from experience, but it will take years of teaching experience 
to give her the insight, knowledge and technical skill which 
can be developed in a brief summer session course, if the 
course is properly organized. But while the teacher is ac- 
quiring her experience the children must suffer because of 
her inexperience and incompetence. The work of amateurs 
is bad enough for normal children, though most of these will 
press ahead in spite of poor teaching. With various types 
of defective children amateur experimenting will prove ex-
-P-A-G-E-273
  
THE CURRICULUM AND THE TEACHER = 255 
ceedingly wasteful, and sometimes quite fatal. Experience 
is a slow, wasteful, costly teacher. A teacher of average 
ability who had been employed in a high-grade private 
school for defectives reported that she received more infor- 
mation, perspective and comprehension of the problems, and 
acquired more skill for doing a high quality of industrial 
arts work from a six-weeks’ summer course than from her six 
years of practical experience in training deficients. The 
course of progress due to mere experience is halting, tortu- 
ous, uncertain, and narrowly limited. Men continued for 
thousands of years to repeat the same useless movements in 
laying bricks until a simple experiment revealed better meth- 
ods. There is no need for the teacher to go through the 
wasteful process of trying to discover for herself how to 
teach subnormal children. A good training course will famil- 
iarize her with the “garnered wisdom of the world,” and 
with the best current thought and practice. 
Need of special training now generally recognized. The 
view is gaining wide acceptance that the teacher for the men- 
tally deficient is just as greatly in need of special training as 
the teacher of domestic science, manual training, speech 
defects, or kindergarten work. According to the writer’s 
investigation in 1913, seventy per cent of the one hundred 
and two citics replying did not at the time appoint, or had 
decided not to appoint in future, teachers for the classes for 
defectives who had not had special preparation for the work. 
Some cities have gone farther, and require the candidates to 
pass a special qualifying examination after having pursued a 
special course of training. To contend at this stage of de- 
velopment of special-class work, as has been done, even by 
educators (fortunately by no one who has made any con- 
tribution to the work or who possesses any claims to recog- 
nition) that the chief qualification needed by teachers for 
mental defectives is the ability to nurse, mother, and care 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
256 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
for the children, is to fly directly in the face of enlightened 
practice, and to affront the intelligence of the skilled workers 
in the field. The teacher’s chief job, in special as well as in 
regular classes, is to develop the intelligence, character, 
ideals, knowledge, sentiments, and skill of her pupils. 
Amount of training required. There is, however, no gen- 
erally accepted standard regarding the character and the 
amount of special training necessary for the preparation of 
skilled special-class teachers. Some contend that the min- 
imum requirement should represent the equivalent of a col- 
lege course, or four years beyond the high school. Some 
hold that the teachers should be trained from the outset for 
work with defectives, as kindergartners or manual training 
teachers are now trained. Some hold that the teacher should 
first finish a two years’ normal-school course, and then se- 
cure one or two additional years of specialized training. 
Others consider that one semester or a six weeks’ summer 
course will suffice if the teacher is a graduate of a recognized 
normal school and has several years of teaching experience. 
The Missouri regulations, prepared by the author, require 
for State certification at least eight semester hours’ credit in 
special work in addition to a normal school diploma, or its 
equivalent. 
The majority of teachers of the mentally deficient now in 
the service probably have only had a six weeks’ special 
course. Eventually two years of specialized training in ad- 
dition to the two years’ normal school course may be estab- 
lished, by common consent, as the minimum requirement, 
if the present salary scale continues in force. But the coun- 
try at large is not yet ready to take this step. The most 
that we can do at the present juncture is to insist that grad- 
uates from the regular normal school course should be re- 
quired to pursue a special course for a year, a semester or a 
summer session before they may be accredited for special-
-P-A-G-E-275
  THE CURRICULUM AND THE TEACHER = 257 
class work. In terms of credits, the very minimum require- 
ment should be six or seven semester hours of credit in the 
strictly technical branches. A few years of contact with 
normal children in the lower grades will, in my judgment, 
prove advantageous. It will provide perspective and stand- 
ards of judgment regarding normal modes of response, 
growth, and improvement, and familiarity with the recog- 
nized teaching methods for normals. 
Nature of training. A reasonably adequate or balanced 
course of study (assuming as prerequisites the usual profes- 
sional teacher-training courses) should include a course in 
clinical psychology and psychopathology, dealing with the 
methods used in making clinical examinations of mental 
deviates, together with the significant scientific facts dis- 
covered by such examinations;1 a practicum in the first- 
hand clinical examination and testing by laboratory meth- 
ods, including social investigations in the field, and the 
working up and presentation of case-histories; a course on 
mentally inferior children (e.g., such a one as the lectures 
on which this book is based); a course in the details of the 
corrective pedagogy for the mentally retarded and deficient; 
a course in observation and cadet or apprentice teaching in 
all the special-class activities, with a variety of grades and 
types of defectives, under the supervision of expert demon- 
stration and critic teachers (the training in this department 
to be closely correlated with the theory department); vari- 
ous courses to develop teaching skill in sensori-motor and 
kindergarten activities, plays and corrective physical train- 
ing, a great variety of different types of industrial arts work, 
and the correction of speech defects (some of this training 
can be secured in the observation and practice course). 
Need of basic manual training course. It cannot be em- 
phasized too strongly that the special-class teacher must 
1] hope to have the course I have given in book form eventually.
-P-A-G-E-276
  258 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
have had a basic course in manual training. She must be 
thoroughly trained in the care, adjustment, preservation, 
cleaning, and sharpening of tools. She must know how to 
sharpen all kinds of tools (although in the large school sys- 
tems the sharpening will be done by an employee), and how 
to clean paint brushes. She must understand the necessity 
of keeping a neat shop, and of placing the tools and objects 
made in their proper places after each exercise. 
Necessity of supervising children’s manual-training work. 
Moreover, it is of the utmost importance that the teacher 
should so train the defective pupils that they will adjust the 
tools properly, that they will not damage the tools through 
careless or rough use, that they will not waste any of the 
materials, and that they will take pride in keeping an orderly 
shop with everything in its place and no shavings or débris 
left lying on the floors or the work-benches. I should not 
refer to these very elementary considerations were it not for 
the wanton waste of materials and injury to tools which I 
have witnessed in some special classes. I have seen boys 
sawing vigorously in the iron base of a miter saw. I have 
seen boys chiseling against nails, planing against a project- 
ing iron in the work-bench, planing against the grain with an 
improperly adjusted blade, and sawing large boards into 
pieces when there has been available a large supply of pieces 
of the right size. The teacher should understand that the 
activities in the manual-training room must be watchfully 
supervised. 
7. Not only should the teacher qualify for the work before 
receiving an appointment; to keep abreast of the times, she 
must grow and develop after she has entered the service. 
This can only be done through independent study and inves- 
tigation, through pursuing extension and summer-school 
courses, and through the reading of new books and technical 
journals. The teacher should read at least two or three new
-P-A-G-E-277
THE CURRICULUM AND THE TEACHER 259 
books and two or three journals every year dealing with her 
specialty or closely related topics. 
The rewards of special-class teaching. Many teachers 
who desire to escape from the drudgery, formalism, and lock- 
step of mass instruction will regard the opportunity to do 
individual work with small numbers and to render a high 
type of social service as compensation enough for entering 
upon special-class work. I have known special-class teachers 
who have been given opportunity to return to the grades but 
who have preferred to remain in the specials. Others after a 
period in the grades have asked to be returned to the special 
classes. Nevertheless the large majority of teachers shrink 
from special-class work, either because they consider that 
the work is too strenuous, or that it does not offer the inspi- 
ration which comes from perceiving growth and develop- 
ment in normal children — which is one of the chief sources 
of satisfaction to the real teacher — or because they fear the 
children are unattractive or repulsive and more difficult to 
control. In order, however, to induce teachers to make ade- 
quate preparation and secure a strong personnel for the 
special classes, the practice has become very general of offer- 
ing a differential or a bonus to special-class teachers. Sev- 
enty-five per cent of the cities answering my questionnaire 
in 1913 paid a differential varying from $50 to $300 a year, 
while eight per cent gave no increase, the others failing to 
supply the information. This practice undoubtedly attracts 
many superior teachers who would not otherwise spend time 
and money to fit themselves for the service. The payment of 
a differential to well-qualified and meritorious special-class 
teachers is thoroughly justifiable. The payment of a bonus 
as an unearned perquisite is indefensible.

  CHAPTER X 
RELATION OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS TO (I) HIGH 
FECUNDITY AND (II) DEGENERATE PROGENY 
The possible menace of the mentally defective classes. The 
presence of the feeble-minded in the body politic sometimes 
creates various grave social problems, for two important 
reasons. On the one hand, many homeless mental defectives 
fare very badly when turned adrift to shift for themselves 
without proper protection or support. They are bandied 
about from pillar to post, and become the innocent butts of 
the village jesters and the helpless victims, dupes, or cat’s- 
paws of all kinds of human vultures or evil designers. On 
the other hand, some of the feeble-minded who are subject to 
various anti-social proclivities, will become aggressive evil 
doers and violators of the laws and conventions of society. 
The following two chapters will be devoted to a brief critical 
consideration of the possible ways in which the mentally de- 
fective class may become a positive menace to society. The 
indictment repeatedly lodged against the feeble-minded con- 
tains six distinct counts. 
I. It is alleged that the feeble-minded produce a large 
progeny of both legitimate and illegitimate offspring 
Contradictory views regarding the fertility of the so-called 
degenerate classes. On the one hand, there are writers who 
contend that neuroticism represents a “progressive degen- 
eration” leading to insanity, epilepsy, idiocy, diminished 
vitality, sterility, and eventually final extinction. Féré con- 
ceives of neuropathic diathesis as a “dissolution of hered- 
ity,” while W. W. Ireland holds that “there is always a 
   
-P-A-G-E-284
266 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
tendency to return to the normal or average condition of 
the race.” 
On the other hand, the literature of the last decade, par- 
ticularly popular dissertations of a semi-scientific and a eu- 
genic character, has been permeated with repeated warnings 
that all classes of neuropaths are multiplying much faster 
than the general population, and that it is only a question of 
time when civilization will be completely swamped by the 
onrushing tide of degeneracy. It has been especially em- 
phasized that the feeble-minded represent a biologically vig- 
orous and highly fertile stock which, instead of tending to 
die out, is propagating at a much faster rate than the general 
population. 
Nature of the supporting evidence. The belief in the 
heightened reproductivity of the feeble-minded is based on 
estimates and observations of individual instances and vari- 
ous comparative statistical investigations of the fertility 
rate of parents who have been alleged to be feeble-minded 
and of those alleged to be normal. 
A. F. Tredgold avers that it has been “amply demon- 
strated” that the birth rate is greater in feeble-minded and 
psychopathic stock. He found an average of 8.4 births 
among 150 aments from “markedly psychopathic” stock 
(usually only one parent being tainted), as against an average 
of 4.6 for the general population of England and Wales 
(based on the statistics of 1876). However, in a block of 19 
married feeble-minded mothers he found an average of only 
4.2 children, and in a block of 42 unmarried feeble-minded 
mothers only 1.8. C. P. Lapage reports an average of six 
children in 500 families in each of which there were one or 
more feeble-minded children; W. W. Ireland, an average of 
6.2 children in 204 families with “idiots”; Kerlin, an aver- 
age of 5.6 in 100 families; and Ettie Sayer, an average of 7.6 
births in 100 families having children in the London special  
-P-A-G-E-285
CONSEQUENCES OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS 267 
classes as compared with an average of 5.0 births in 100 fam- 
ilies having children in the regular grades in London, every 
seventh child on the registers in the special and regular 
classes having been impartially selected for investigation. 
The average number of children of 22 alleged feeble-minded 
mothers in New York was 6.6. In D. A. Heron’s tabulation 
the average size of the families in various pathological stocks 
(“deaf mutes, degenerates, criminals, insane, mentally de- 
fective, and tuberculous”’) was 6.2, as against 5.3 in normal 
stocks selected from intellectual, artisan, and working classes, 
n average difference of 0.9. The largest families were found 
among mental defectives living in London (7.0), exclusive of 
married female inebriates (an average of 9.2), the childless 
inebriates not being included. 
In the investigation of the familiy lines of 310 inmates in 
the Vineland Training School, which was pushed several 
generations into the past and which involved the tabulation 
of 12,922 individuals, the alcoholics (families of “drunk- 
ards”) averaged 1.4 children more per mating than the non- 
alcoholics (5.5 versus 4.1), the “heredity” group 0.7 more 
than the group in which “no cause” for the mental defi- 
ciency was assigned (4.5 versus 3.8), but 1.2 less than the 
“neuropathic” group (5.7). In matings in which both par- 
ents were rated as feeble-minded, the average was 0.6 greater 
than in matings in which only one parent was rated as feeble- 
minded (5.2 versus 4.6), 0.5 greater than in the matings of 
two alleged normal persons (4.7) but 0.3 less than in the mat- 
ings of inebriates. 
The average number of children “per parent” in the Nam 
Family (which is referred to again in the next section) was 
4.0, or exclusive of the mothers of the fifth and sixth gen- 
erations who were still reproducing, 4.2, the modal number 
being two. 
According to H. H. Laughlin the average number of chil-
-P-A-G-E-286
  268 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
dren surviving over two-and-a-half years was 4.6 in 1000 
“families of defectives” and 4.4 in 700 “normal families,” 
an insignificant difference. 
The writer compiled various data from the different clin- 
ical record blanks of a considerable block of consecutive 
cases examined by him in the St. Louis Psycho-Educational 
Clinic, by methods described in Causative Factors of Mental 
Inferiority and the Prevention of Degeneracy. These data are 
unique in that they are not based on selected institutional 
cases from a restricted social level or of a restricted mental 
classification, but on public school pupils of different social 
status and different levels of intelligence varying from idiocy 
to normality. These children undoubtedly spring from a 
higher social and economic stratum than the institutional 
cases on which practically all similar American and nearly 
all similar European studies thus far published have been 
based. 
After having ascertained the total number of siblings in 
each family of the clinic cases, the average number was com- 
puted for all the cases in each intelligence category. The 
total number of siblings, including the clinic cases, was 4324. 
The average number of children in the families containing 
clinic cases classified in the same intelligence category is 
given in the third column of the tabulation shown in 
Table 2, page 269. 
It is seen that the offspring were the most numerous in the 
families containing morons, followed by those containing 
children of backward and borderline grades. As compared 
with the general average, the families which had mental 
defectives showed an average excess of 0.63 child per mating, 
the excess for those which had morons amounting to 1.3, and 
for those which had backward children 1.0. Families hav- 
ing “normal and retarded” children averaged 1.2 children 
less than those having mental defectives.

‘The ascending groups in the table represent ascending levels of intelligence, the “ retarded ” 
being less backward than the “backward.” The average amount of retardation and aver- 
age I.Q.’s for these categories have been given in Problems of Subnormality and The Value of 
the Intelligence Quotient for Individual Diagnosis. 
  The difference is thrown into sharper relief by computing 
the percentage of the families which had eight or more chil- 
dren, as has been done in the last column. The excess for 
the families with mental defectives amounts to 6.9 per cent 
compared with all the families and 13 per cent compared 
with the families with “normal and retarded” children. The 
excess for the matings in which there were morons compared 
with all the matings was 15.4 per cent. 
It is evident from the above summary that the recorded 
data are quite discrepant and that there is no basis in fact 
for the categorical assertion repeatedly made, that feeble- 
minded mothers average twice as many children as normal 
ones. Not only have most investigations disclosed a much 
smaller difference, but the total number of direct descend-
-P-A-G-E-288
270 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
ants has actually been found to be fewer in some defective 
strains than in normal strains which have been traced through 
a number of generations. Thus the investigation of the ille- 
gitimate lines of the Kallikak and Garland families yielded 
only 480 and 437 offspring, respectively, as compared with 
496 for the normal legitimate line of each of these two fam- 
ilies. 
Inaccuracy of data. It must be freely admitted that the 
records of births which have been obtained are not very ac- 
curate, and that the inaccuracy of the original data may be 
largely responsible for the discrepancies found. The inac- 
curacies may be due to a number of causes. 
(1) To the incorrectness of the diagnosis. Many persons 
have been diagnosed as feeble-minded or normal offhand on 
the basis of mere reports, or a mere interview, or a superficial 
examination, or without any examination whatever. Many 
of the examinations have been made by “field workers” who 
are neither trained examining psychologists nor neuro- 
psychiatrists. Moreover, numerous diagnoses of feeble- 
mindedness have been based almost solely on arbitrary, and 
frequently inadmissible, standards of intelligence retarda- 
tion as determined by so-called measuring scales of intelli- 
gence. 
(2) To the failure to secure accurate data on the number 
of abortions, miscarriages, or deaths, or to compare families 
in which the child bearing has been completed. 
Stillbirths and infantile mortality. Case histories and 
statistical compilations indicate that there are more still- 
births and infant deaths in the families of the mentally de- 
fective than in the families of the normal. Of eleven chil- 
dren in one New York family of “defectives,” three were 
stillborn, four died while teething, two died from diphtheria, 
leaving two alive, one of whom was classed as feeble-minded. 
Of the fifteen children of the feeble-minded and immoral

CONSEQUENCES OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS 271 
“Marvin” woman from New York, seven were dead, includ- 
ing one stillbirth. Of 146 children of 22 mothers from New 
York who were alleged to be mentally defective, 35 or 24 
| per cent died in infancy. Of Tredgold’s 1269 children of 
_ 150 aments, 170 or 13.3 per cent were stillborn, and 315 or 
_ 24,8 per cent died after birth, giving a total mortality of 
38.2 per cent. Of his 158 children of 19 married and 42 un- 
married feeble-minded mothers, 40 or 25.2 per cent died in 
infancy. In Ettie Sayer’s families containing the normal 
children, the mortality was 28.6 per cent (including 23 mis- 
carriages which comprised 4.5 per cent of the 506 children), 
and in the families containing the feeble-minded children 
38.7 per cent (including 101 miscarriages, which amounted 
to 13.2 per cent of the 761 children), hence the average excess 
of the survivors in the latter families was reduced to 0.8 of a 
child for each mating. Clark and Stowell assert that one 
fifth of mental defectives die under one year of age from 
infectious diseases and inanition. In the illegitimate line of 
the Kallikak family, 82 or 17 per cent died in infancy, as 
compared with 15 or 8 per cent in the legitimate line. When 
only the survivors are considered the average number of 
children to the mating is about the same for the different 
groups of the 12,922 who were charted in the Vineland in- 
vestigation, the figures being as follows: 3.8 in the “hered- 
ity” group, 3.7 in the “accidental cause” and unclassified 
groups, and 3.6 in the “no cause” and neuropathic groups. 
These percentages of stillbirths and early deaths are higher 
than those reported for the general population. In New 
York City between 1898 and 1909 the death-rate per 1000 
varied for children under five years from 67.2 to 49.5 and 
between 1910 and 1922 from 47.7 to 23.8, the average for 
44 years being 68. For children under one year it varied 
from 205 to 187 between 1898 and 1909, and from 126 to 71 
between 1910 and 1922. The rate for stillbirths per 1000
-P-A-G-E-290
  272 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
births varied from 1.72 to 1.45 between 1898 and 1909, and 
from 1.41 to 1.07 between 1910 and 1921. According to Farr 
and Newsholme of England 4 per cent of all births are still- 
births. Couvelaire found that 4.6 per cent of 834,411 births 
in France were stillbirths (including seven months’ fetuses 
dying during gestation or parturition or within three days 
after birth), as compared with 7.2 per cent in Paris (of which 
many were known to be voluntary abortions). 
Post-infantile mortality. The post-infantile rate of mor- 
tality also seems to be higher among mental defectives. 
G. E. Shuttleworth is quoted to the effect that the mortality 
is nine times as great for mental defectives as for normals 
for the age periods from five to ten, ten to fifteen, and fifteen 
to twenty. Tredgold says that the death rate is the highest 
from fifteen to twenty, when it is the lowest for normals, giv- 
ing a mortality rate of thirty per thousand for aments as 
against twenty for the general population. M. W. Barr 
found that only 83 of 625 mental defectives were alive at the 
age of twenty-five, most dying between ten and twenty. 
Clark and Stowell found among one thousand deaths of 
mental defectives that most deaths occurred before twenty. 
Lapage, on the other hand, holds that the death-rate be- 
tween five and twenty is not necessarily unusual. 
Although the efforts of modern hygiene, medicine, and 
social betterment unmistakably tend to reduce the mortal- 
ity rate among all classes, thereby contributing toward the 
perpetuation of all types of weaklings, it is probable that 
the mortality rate is still so much higher among mental 
defectives, neuropaths, or degenerates as to counterbal- 
ance, wholly or in part, the alleged tendency of the latter 
classes to multiply more rapidly than the general popula- 
tion. 
Explanation of the alleged heightened rate of reproduc- 
tion of the mentally defective. Conceding that there may
-P-A-G-E-291
  
CONSEQUENCES OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS 273 
be more children born in the families of the feeble-minded 
than in the families of the normal (although, as we have seen, 
this is not always the case), what is the explanation? A 
number of suggestions have been offered: 
(1) Economic pressure, or the inability to make a living, 
forces many mentally defective girls into immoral careers. 
This is undoubtedly true, but the natural consequence of 
such conduct is ultimate sterility supervening upon venereal 
infection. 
(2) The feeble-minded beget offspring earlier, and this 
tends to increase the number of the progeny. This is no 
doubt true in individual instances. 
(3) It is alleged that the feeble-minded are oversexed; 
that their sex life is more elemental, turbulent, violent, and 
unrestrained. It is true that some feeble-minded individ- 
uals, particularly among the females, are conspicuously lack- 
ing in the sense of shame or in modesty — perhaps it should 
be said that they are unmodest rather than immodest — 
that some are subject to excessive erotomania, sometimes 
verging on nymphomania, and that some are given to exhibi- 
tionism, the practice of self-abuse, or excessive venery. But 
this factor, at most, is only a minor one. My observation of 
mental defectives in special classes indicates that as a class 
they are not oversexed. Even Goddard, who has specially 
emphasized the immorality of the feeble-minded, concedes 
that their “sexual instinct” is underdeveloped rather than 
“overdeveloped,” and ascribes the apparent excess of eroti- 
cism to “lack of control.” The percentage of immorality 
among the 1918 feeble-minded cases investigated at Vine- 
land was only 8.8 per cent, as compared with 13.2 per cent 
among 113 “normals.” 
(4) Their lack of judgment, intelligence, and ability to 
resist or protect themselves render mentally defective girls 
ready victims, especially of normal men. This factor is very
-P-A-G-E-292
  274° EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
probably of greater moment than inherent viciousness or 
eroticism. 
(5) It is alleged that their fertility or fecundity rate is 
abnormally high. Individual cases are often cited in sup- 
port of the claim that the feeble-minded are “prodigiously 
fertile.” The union of an imbecile man with a delicate de- 
fective woman resulted in a progeny of nineteen children in 
twenty years, all rated as defective. A wayward, degener- 
ate girl in New Jersey died after giving birth to her thir- 
teenth child. “Marvin” had fifteen children in nineteen 
years. An English defective had eighteen children. While 
such instances could be multiplied, there is, in my judgment, 
little force to this explanation. Similar instances can be 
found among normal women. Thus among the parents in 
one group of my clinic cases, I found two families with sev- 
enteen children each in which the parents were normal. 
(6) They do not practice birth-control to nearly the same 
extent as do normal persons. This is undoubtedly one of the 
prime reasons for such heightened birth-rate as actually ex- 
ists in individual cases among the mentally defective. 
It follows from the foregoing discussion that we are in- 
clined to discount largely the calamitous predictions respect- 
ing the decadence of the race so vociferously broadcast in the 
contemporary “literature of despair,” based on the hypothe- 
sis of the “prodigious productivity of the mentally defective 
strains.” 
Il. It is alleged that the feeble-minded produce a neuro- 
pathic, degenerate, or dysgenic progeny 
The worst aspect of the reproductivity of the feeble- 
minded is the belief that they “breed true,” or “reproduce 
their kind.” This belief is based largely on the “pedigree 
charts” or “family histories” which have been worked up 
for large numbers of mental defectives, as well as for epilep-

Classical cases of dysgenic heredity. Numerous strains 
of “cacogenic” or “degenerate” stocks have now been 
traced through several generations, with such degrees of ac- 
curacy of the recorded data and of the interpretations as 
investigations of this character permit. It must here suffice 
to give a very brief summary of the records of the most 
notorious of these defective family lines, in order that the 
student may obtain some realization of the type of cacogenic 
data on which eugenic conclusions are largely based. The 
names given in the following histories are fictitious.

Jukes. (Investigated by R. L. Dugdale in 1874 and rein- 
ted by A. H. Estabrook in 1915.) The progenitor of this 
Max Juke, of Dutch extraction, was born between 1720 
and 1740 in Ulster County, New York, in an unfertile, inaccessible 
valley, where the descendants lived until 1880, when they were 
scattered as a result of the abandonment of the cement industry. 
Max was a jolly, companionable, hard drinking hunter and fisher- 
man who was averse to toil and only worked by spells. His two 
sons, one of whom was a thief, married two sisters from a family of 
six girls. One of these girls left the country. The other three, two 
of whom were immoral, married men who were rated as defec- 
tive in some respect. From these five notorious Jukes sisters has 
sprung a strain of ignorant, lazy, shiftless, licentious, immoral, de- 
fective, pauper, and criminal progeny, whose descendants had 
spread into fourteen states of the Union by 1915. During a period 
of 180 years, 2094 persons of Juke blood (that is, descendants of the 
five original sisters) and 726 of z-blood (that is, persons who have 
“married into or consorted with the Juke blood”) have been 
traced, or a total of 2820. The following is a partial record of the 
social liability of this tribe, together with the estimated cost to 
society of their anti-social behavior up to the time that Estabrook 
made his investigation, when many were still young children:

1258 descendants of the five original sisters were alive in 1915:

were good citizens, 255 fair, and 305 anti-social (or 43 per cent of 
705); 51 were prostitutes at the time, while 82 formerly had been; 
41 were criminals, 83 were intemperate, 152 industrious, and 103 
“marked cases of mental defect.” 
Tribe of Ishmael. (First studied by O. C. McCulloch in 1888 and 
more recently by the Eugenics Record Office.) This has been 
an exceedingly prolific strain, especially notorious for its pau- 
perism, licentiousness, prostitution, and “gypsing.” The family 
migrated from Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and the Caro- 
linas through Kentucky (about 1790) and Southern Ohio to Marion 
County, Indiana. The son of the progenitor married a half-breed 
and moved to Indianapolis in 1825 (according to Estabrook) where 
three of his sons married three sisters from a pauper family. It has 
been estimated that there were 6000 Ishmaelites from 400 family 
heads in 1885, and that there are 10,000 to-day. They have mi- 
grated to many States, but mainly to Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, 
Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Kansas. There is scarcely a family 
without some paupers and mendicants, while some lines contain 
many generations of beggars. Three generations were found in a 
poor house at one time. Many are given to gypsying during the 
summer time, in wagons or on foot, camping in the creek bottoms 
in wagons, hollow trees, or empty houses, and living off the country 
by begging or stealing. Toward the approach of winter they have 
been accustomed to return to Indianapolis. Many have changed 
consorts at will. Of four members of one fraternity, one was mated 
six times, two five times each, and one seven times. A daughter of 
the latter woman, a prostitute, was married ten times without
-P-A-G-E-296
  278 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
being divorced. There were 121 known prostitutes in the fourth 
generation. It has been estimated that this tribe has cost the coun- 
try more than the Jukes. 
The Nam Family. (Investigated by A. H. Estabrook and C. B. 
Davenport.) The progenitor, a Dutchman who married an Indian 
princess, wandered from New York to Western Massachusetts 
about 1760. One of his grandsons, Joseph Nam, a Revolutionary 
soldier and vagabond, had eight children, of whom five migrated to 
New York State about 1800, the majority settling in or near ““Nam 
Hollow.” As time went on, some prospered, others remained 
“ignorant, unintelligent, indolent, and alcoholic.” Their children 
were uneducated and grew up in an environment of intemperance 
and immorality (the besetting sins of this tribe). They lived in 
huts and hovels, sleeping on beds of rags, thirty-two people of 
both sexes being found by the investigator occupying one room in 
the winter time. 
Of the 1795 descendants traced, 852 sprang from the original 
Nam, 55.5 per cent of these being in the third generation. Twenty- 
two and six tenths per cent of all the matings were consanguineous. 
Of the parents of 695 Nams, 20.2 per cent were born out of wed- 
lock, while 180 children (of all those considered) were born out of 
wedlock. One hundred and ninety-nine men and 232 women, or 
a total of 431, were licentious, while only 83 men and 155 women, 
or a total of 238, were chaste. Harlotry was ten times as common 
as professional prostitution (which was more common among the 
Jukes). Eighty-eight per cent of the females and ninety per cent 
of the males drank to excess. Nineteen were epileptics, 24 insane 
(7 having been in a custodial institution), three had been in a girls’ 
home, 15 in an orphanage, 11 in poor houses, and 40 in jails or 
state prisons. The cost to the State in poor relief, institutional 
care, alcoholism, prostitution, arson, thievery, and murder was es- 
timated at the time of the investigation to be $1,411,676. 
The Hill Folk. (Investigated by Florence H. Danielson and C. B. 
Davenport.) A “shiftless, weak-minded element” inhabiting a 
Massachusetts town of 2000 population located among the hills in 
a fertile valley, was traced partly to Neil Rasp, a poor, shiftless, 
harmless, alcoholic hunter and basket-maker of French extraction 
who, according to the authors, had five children by a “feeble- 
minded wife,” all “‘feeble-minded to a greater or less extent”; and 
partly to an Englishman called Nuke. Among the men, this strain 
produced in one line alcoholism, and in another line sexual miscon-
-P-A-G-E-297
  CONSEQUENCES OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS 279 
duct. The male cousins in one line were fairly temperate, but the 
women were immoral. Of 737 people included in the study, 18 
were known to be illegitimate (2.4 per cent), 24 per cent of the 82 
married women had bastards before or after marriage, 8 married 
women, or 10 per cent were prostitutes (all married), 65 persons, or 
8. 8 per cent of all, received relief of different sorts (37 being State 
wards), 186, or 18.4 per cent of all, and 50 per cent of the school: 
children living at home, were classified as feeble-minded,! while 
10 were classed as epileptic. Twenty, or about 25 per cent of the 
marriages, were cousin marriages. Twenty-four, or 3.3 per cent, 
showed criminal tendencies, 16, or 2.2 per cent, had been convicted 
of crime, being sentenced for a total of 37.5 years. The estimated 
cost to the state from this strain for relief, institutional care, crime, 
prostitution and alcoholism during somewhat over 60 years prior 
to the investigation was placed at $498,260. It is of note that there 
were relatively fewer criminals and sex offenders among the Hill 
Folk than among the Jukes. 
The German Family of Ada Tiircker. From this thieving, vaga- 
bond woman, born in 1740, suspected of having been mentally de- 
fective, although physically robust, 834 descendants were identi- 
fied. Of the 709 whose histories were traced, 143 were mendicants, 
64 were inmates of asylums, 181 were prostitutes, 69 were crimi- 
nals, and 7 were murderers. The cost to the Prussian state in pau- 
perism and crime was estimated some years ago at $1,250,000. 
The Garland Family. The Garland and the Kallikak families are 
unique “experiments of nature” in that they permit a comparison 
of a “normal strain” with an illegitimate strain each of which has 
issued from a common male progenitor. The original Garland who 
died in 1837 (apparently an English line) had an illegitimate child 
by a mentally deficient woman, but subsequently married a normal 
woman. Of 437 descendants from the illegitimate stock, 180 were 
classified as feeble-minded while none was so classified among 496 
descendants of the legitimate stock. The data do not indicate 
whether equally rigid standards of diagnosing mental deficiency 
were observed in tracing the two lines of descent. The expectation 
would be that at least a few accidental cases of defect would be 
found in the legitimate line.   
1 The authors adopt a very liberal concept of feeble-mindedness (“a com- 
plex of quantitatively and qualitatively varying factors most of which are 
negative”) which obviously accounts for the high estimate of mental defi- 
ciency.
-P-A-G-E-298
280 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
The Kallikak Family. (Investigated by the Vineland field- 
workers and H. H. Goddard.) Martin Kallikak, Sr., who was of 
normal stock and a soldier in the Revolutionary war, had a feeble- 
minded son, Martin Kallikak, Jr. (known as “Old Horror”), by a 
feeble-minded girl whom he met at a tavern. Martin, Jr., who 
lived in a mountain hut in New Jersey (most of the descendants 
have remained in the same locality), married a normal woman by 
whom he had seven children, five of whom were classed as feeble- 
minded and two as normal. From this line were traced 480 de- 
scendants in six generations, of whom 143 were classified as feeble- 
minded, 46 as normal, and 291 as of unknown mentality. Thirty- 
six were illegitimate, 33 immoral (mostly prostitutes), 8 kept 
brothels in a rural community, 24 were confirmed alcoholics, 3 were 
criminals, and 3 were epileptics, while 82 died in infancy. Of the 
1146 individuals charted from the exogenous marriages, 262 were 
considered feeble-minded, 197 normal, while the mentality of the 
others was “‘undetermined.” 
Martin, Sr., however, after leaving the Revolutionary Army, 
married a normal, respectable girl. Of their 496 direct descend- 
ants all were declared to be normal, except three men who were 
“somewhat degenerate” (two alcoholic and one immoral). There 
were no convicted criminals recorded, and only fifteen (3 per cent) 
died in infancy. The descendants, who married into the best fam- 
ilies, include colonial governors, signers of the Declaration of Inde- 
pendence, founders of a great university, doctors, lawyers, judges, 
educators, traders, and landowners. 
Passing over the histories of other cacogenic strains such as the 
Pineys (New Jersey), the Hickory Family (Ohio), the Rufer Fam- 
ily (Pennsylvania) and The Dwellers in the Vale of Siddim (Minne- 
sota), the record of an entirely different type of transmission, 
namely a eugenic line of descent, may be briefly rehearsed. 
The Jonathan Edwards Family. At the time the data were com- 
piled, the 1394 identified descendants of this family had contrib- 
uted 295 college graduates, 12 college presidents, 65 college profes- 
sors, 100 each clergymen, musicians, and lawyers, 80 public offi- 
cials, 75 army and navy officers, 60 each physicians and prominent 
authors, 30 judges, 3 United States senators, one vice-president, 
and no known convicted criminal. 
Accuracy of the pedigree or family history data, and con- 
clusions to be drawn therefrom. It must be frankly ad- 
 
-P-A-G-E-299
  
CONSEQUENCES OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS 281 
mitted, as already hinted, that family histories cannot, in 
the very nature of the case, be made very accurate, particu- 
larly so far as concerns the record of minor social and moral 
lapses and the diagnosis of mental defect. The differential 
diagnoses of the dead of past generations are almost entirely 
conjectural, based almost solely on hearsay information, or 
traditional lore, or the record of lawless behavior. Even 
members of the living generations have been frequently diag- 
nosed as mentally defective without any examination or in- 
vestigation other than of their record of delinquency or social 
maladjustment, while many of those diagnosed as mentally 
defective, usually by field workers, have not fallen far short 
of the average level of intelligence of the population at large, 
judged by the findings of the Army Alpha. There is no way 
accurately to determine what proportion of the reported 
defectives have been feeble-minded and what proportion 
dull, stupid, or ignorant. 
Moreover, when the investigator has started out with 
preconceived conclusions regarding the absolute dominance 
of heredity (possibly as an avowed protagonist of the Men- 
delian theory of inheritance), the inevitable tendency has 
been to ignore or minimize the incident factors of the en- 
vironment. But it is probable that a bad environment 
usually has hampered the advancement of the cacogenic 
strains, while a good environment has promoted the progress 
of the “eugenic” strains. The hereditary and environmen- 
tal forces supplement and reénforce one another. Many 
persons who can float in a favorable environment, will suc- 
cumb in a less favorable one, just as appropriate training 
in special classes will enable some pupils to function above 
the level of mental deficiency, who without such training 
would have stagnated as feeble-minded. Much crime and 
incompetency among weaklings is traceable to an unpro- 
pitious environment, and could be prevented by a vigorous
-P-A-G-E-300
282 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
community program of constructive euthenics. Although 
an unfavorable environment will drag down the weaker 
strains more than the stronger ones, it is conceivable that if 
the progeny of Martin, Sr., had grown up in the environ- 
ment of Martin, Jr., the character of the ancestral line of the 
former might have been different from what it is. The en- 
vironment always supplies the soil, the opportunities for 
advancement or for deterioration. 
Waving aside the unsatisfactory character of the sup- 
porting data, it is admitted by practically all the authorities 
that feeble-mindedness may be transmitted by inheritance 
to the offspring, but there is lack of agreement as to the ex- 
tent of the transmission and the laws governing the process. 
Certain phases of this question have beer discussed in 
Causative Factors of Mental Inferiority and the Prevention 
of Degeneracy. Space permits the repetition here merely 
of a few of the conclusions reached. 
“Tn the large majority of these cases (extra-institutional 
mental defectives and subnormals) I have not found any 
clear-cut evidence of the presence in the family history of 
the triad which Lapage says constitutes ‘neuropathic 
inheritance’ — namely insanity, epilepsy and feeble-mind- 
edness. If these three constitute the evidence par excellence 
of hereditary taint, the majority of my cases have been non- 
hereditary.!. If my cases are hereditary, the ‘taint’ must 
be based on minor neuropathies and unrecognized factors. 
“Feeble-mindedness may be produced by a variety of 
factors, either environmental or hereditary, acting sepa- 
rately or concurrently. Both mental normality and feeble- 
1 One of the facts discovered in support of this conclusion, was that only 
7.9 per cent of the 1969 children who had attended special public schools for 
mental defectives during a period of 124 years were siblings. Lapage found 
that only 9 per cent of 830 families with a mental defective contained two 
or more cases. In both investigations the vast majority of mental defectives 
were isolated or sporadic cases.
-P-A-G-E-301
CONSEQUENCES OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS 283 
mindedness are complex, not simple conditions. The causa- 
tion is as complex as the conditions. ... In many cases it is 
obscure and ambiguous.” 
But the evidence shows that “many destructive agencies, 
especially toxins, may injure the germ plasm, or the brain of 
the embryo or the fetus, or the brain of the young child. ... 
Blastophthoric agents which impinge upon the soma of the 
parents may injure the ova and the spermatozoa, and the 
germinal defects thus produced may be transmitted to the 
progeny.” 
To repeat this conclusion in slightly different words: 
“destructive, poisonous substances, if sufficiently intense, 
virulent, or long continued, may modify and injure the soma 
and the germ plasm of the parents and of the embryo and 
fetus, either through the direct or the indirect action of the 
toxins, thereby producing neuronic arrest or degeneration 
and mental abnormalities and... the modifications thus 
produced may be transmitted to the progeny for one or more 
generations.” 
“This doctrine will probably be regarded as heterodox and 
unscientific, for it has become almost a fixed tenet that the 
germ plasm leads a charmed, insulated, protected existence, 
and that it is invulnerable, immutable, and sacrosanct.” 
But “experiments on plants and animals have shown that 
the germinal constitution can be modified by various blasto- 
phthoric stimuli, and that the modifications can be trans- 
mitted to the offspring.” Some of the experiments on which 
these conclusions are based will be cited in the next chapter.

CHAPTER XI 
THE RELATION OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS TO (III) 
CRIMINALITY, (IV) INEBRIETY, (V) SOCIAL IMMO. 
RALITY AND (VI) PAUPERISM AND VAGRANCY 
  Ill. It is alleged that the feeble-minded possess strong 
criminalistic propensities 
In fact, it has been frequently averred that every feeble- 
minded person is a potential criminal, and there has been 
during the last decade a tendency to blame the feeble-minded 
for a very large share of the country’s crime, especially the 
crimes of arson, petty thievery, homicide, and prostitution. 
It has been repeatedly dinned into our ears that the feeble- 
minded clog our juvenile and adult courts, and congest our 
jails, detention homes, prisons, and reformatories, and that 
the volume of crime could be considerably reduced if the 
feeble-minded were segregated. Elaborate statistical find- 
ings have been cited in support of these conclusions. 
Divergent conclusions from surveys of offenders. It 
would prove bootless to attempt at this place to summarize 
the multitude of estimates and investigations made by psy- 
chiatrists, clinical psychologists, social workers, and intelli- 
gence testers, during the last decade and a half, of juvenile 
and adult offenders and criminals in courts, industrial 
schools, public school classes for delinquents, detention 
homes, reformatories, jails, and prisons. Such a summary 
appeared years ago in Chapter II of our Problems of Sub- 
normality. The more significant recent studies of the delin- 
quent and criminal classes are found in the references to 
Healy, Miner, Williams, Weidensall, Fernald, Hayes, Dawley 
and Ruml in the Appendix of this book. It must here
-P-A-G-E-303
CONSEQUENCES OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS 285 
suffice to point out that there are very wide discrepancies 
between the empirical findings of the different surveys. The 
ratio of mental defectives reported has varied from near 
zero to almost one hundred per cent. This amazing varia- 
tion is due in part to differences in the character of the groups 
investigated, but the chief reason, in all likelihood, is the 
difference in the standards of diagnosis adopted by the differ- 
ent investigators. The large estimates almost always have 
been based on certain arbitrarily assumed units of intelli- 
gence retardation as determined by “intelligence tests.” 
The same criteria when generally applied would render from 
ten to forty-seven per cent of the white population of the 
United States feeble-minded according to the results of the 
intelligence examination of 1,750,000 recruits in our late 
army. Fortunately the tendency is now less manifest to 
“laugh out of court” the conservative estimates made by 
the writer and a few other investigators long before the army 
results were available. The writer’s estimate, that from 
ten to fifteen per cent of the “run of mine” of juvenile 
delinquents are feeble-minded is probably not too conserva- 
tive. 
Feeble-mindedness as such not a prime cause of crimi- 
nality or misconduct. The greater share of the delinquency of 
the feeble-minded is not due to outspoken vicious procliv- 
ities, or to inherent, or aggressive, criminalistic, or murder- 
ous propensities, but to their lack of proper training, of ade- 
quate support, control, and protection, to their inherent 
weaknesses, particularly their defective powers of control or 
inhibition, coupled with excessive credulity, imitativeness, 
and suggestibility; and to the ease with which they can be 
victimized and preyed upon by unscrupulous schemers of 
more astute intelligence. Admittedly some of the feeble- 
minded are strongly criminalistically inclined. There are 
types of mental defectives who are exceedingly restless and 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
286 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
obstreperous; who are subject to frequent, and sometimes 
periodical, tantrums and paroxysms of temper; who are de- 
void of sympathy or respect for the rights of others, or who 
lack moral insight; who are quite irresponsible when not 
closely supervised, who seem to take a fiendish delight in 
inflicting pain or in committing various depredations, in- 
cluding arson; who are consummate plotters of mischief, 
confirmed rapists, prevaricators, and pilferers. But this 
characterization would grossly slander the majority of the 
feeble-minded. It applies to only a limited number and 
many of these are sufficiently tractable to respond to ap- 
propriate training, as already pointed out (see pages 76-78 
and 177-81). 
The dull, backward type more aggressively criminalistic 
than the feeble-minded. Based on experience with public 
school delinquents, we have previously concluded that it is 
“particularly the backward pupil who creates the problems 
of discipline.” He is “a more aggressive and intelligent 
trouble maker and constitutes potentially a greater criminal 
menace. Judging by our case records, in school he is in- 
clined to be listless and inattentive and to fatigue easily, be- 
cause the regular studies do not appeal to him. He is un- 
stable, is inclined to be surly, and is subject to attacks of 
stubbornness. He it is, rather than the feeble-minded child, 
who is the bugbear of the other pupils whom he teases and 
annoys, particularly the younger ones. ... He is unable to 
compete with the normal and brighter pupils, and so he 
grows pessimistic and cynical. He suffers from a certain 
degree of moral obliquity. This fact has also been noted by 
Pearson, who made a comparative study of intelligent, dull, 
robust, and delicate children among the English professional 
classes. He found that the intelligent children were far less 
sullen, far more conscientious, and more robust than the 
dull, suggesting a correlation between intelligence and moral-
-P-A-G-E-305
  
CONSEQUENCES OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS 287 
ity. The ordinary elementary curriculum is maladjusted to 
the needs of the backward child and does not adequately 
prepare him for his life work. Because of this, and because 
of his moral obtuseness, he tends gradually to gravitate into 
the ranks of the social misfits and industrial incompetents, 
the vagabonds, ne’er-do-wells, paupers, criminals, and the 
immoral. We do not say that this is a typical picture of 
every backward child, but it is typical of many such children, 
and we believe that a large number of criminals and prosti- 
tutes now diagnosed as feeble-minded really belong in our 
class of dull, backward individuals.” 
Supporting evidence. In a series of 46 consecutive cases 
admitted to a public school class for truant, troublesome and 
ungovernable boys, who were counted among the most re- 
fractory boys enrolled in the system, twenty-eight of whom 
were also wards of the juvenile court, we were able to diag- 
nose only about eleven per cent as feeble-minded, while 
fifty-two per cent were diagnosed as backward and thirteen 
per cent as borderline. Among 2774 pupils who were re- 
ferred for clinical examination during a seven-year period 
primarily because of suspected mental deficiency or because 
they were considered to be inferior mentally, 444 had a re- 
cord of some sort of misconduct. They were reported to be 
unmanageable in school, or truant, or vicious, or immoral or 
immorally inclined, or mendacious, or thieving. In compar- 
ing the diagnoses, it appeared that there was a smaller ratio 
of cases of low intelligence in the misconduct group than in 
the entire group, the deficiency amounting to 11.4 per cent, 
and 1.3 per cent, respectively, for the feeble-minded and 
borderline categories. On the other hand, the misconduct 
group contained comparatively more cases of higher intelli- 
gence, the aggregate excess of all those diagnosed as normal, 
retarded, and backward amounting to about fourteen per 
cent when compared with the corresponding figures for all
-P-A-G-E-306
  288 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
the cases. This group, of course, does not represent an 
unselected array of juvenile offenders. 
Recidivism. One of the most discouraging aspects of 
juvenile and adult criminality is the tendency toward recidi- 
vism, or the frequent repetition of a vicious circle of crime, 
beginning with some act of misconduct leading to arrest, 
trial, conviction, imprisonment, parole, or discharge, fol- 
lowed by a continuous round of offenses, fines, imprison- 
ments, and releases. The extent of recidivism is inade- 
quately realized by the public at large. Of 182,000 convicted 
in England in 1906, 107,000 or fifty-eight per cent were 
known to have been convicted before, 10,000 or six per cent 
having been convicted over twenty times. Of 152,432 com- 
mitted to the Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) workhouse 
from 1869 to 1912, 71,704 were committed two or more times; 
1551, ten times; 361, twenty times; 112, thirty times; 54, 
forty times; 357, fifty or more times; and the records obvi- 
ously were incomplete. In 1915-16, 1117 of 2735 in the St. 
Louis workhouse were known to be repeaters, fifteen having 
been confined twenty or more times, while 18.1 per cent of 
the 1163 of the juvenile court cases had a record of repeti- 
tion. It is doubtless true that the proportion of mental 
defectives, subnormals, and other types of defectives is 
larger for the recidivist than the non-recidivist type of of- 
fenders. Of eighty-five paroled from Elmira who were 
pronounced “unquestionably feeble-minded,” 37 were re- 
arrested at least once. One imbecile had six prior arrests 
and three prior incarcerations, while one “moron” had 
been arrested nineteen times, usually having been discharged 
on the payment of fines. Seventeen, or 2.8 per cent of six 
hundred “mental defectives” incarcerated in an English 
jail in one year, were known to have had forty convictions, 
while three had 102 convictions each. The record of female 
alcoholics in England is particularly bad.
-P-A-G-E-307
  CONSEQUENCES OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS 289 
Recidivism and mental defect among English female in- 
ebriates. England maintains a number of inebriate reform- 
atories for notorious female drunkards, to which they are 
committed after four prior convictions for drinking, immor- 
ality, and crimes committed while intoxicated. While under 
confinement, investigations have been made of their mental 
and physical condition, behavior reactions in the institu- 
tions, duration of the alcoholism, number of prior convic- 
tions, religion, and education. Apparently the determina- 
tion of the mental condition was made by the medical officers 
on the basis of observations and reports upon their behavior 
reactions. 
The classification made of 3032 inebriates was as follows: 
good or average mentality on admission or six months later, 
86.4 per cent; defective mentality, 49 per cent (including 
“those of low mentality, eccentric, silly, dull, senile, and 
subject to periodical paroxysms of ungovernable temper”); 
very defective, 12.4 per cent (including imbeciles, degen- 
erates, and the insane who were difficult to certify); and 
certifiable insane, 2 per cent. In other words, about 64 per 
cent were judged to be “lacking in mental balance” and 
“mentally incapable of competing on equal terms with their 
normal fellows,” while 66 per cent were classed as “physi- 
cally fit,” that is, competent to do hard work. In one block 
of 865 inebriates, only 3.9 per cent possessed superior educa- 
tion, 52 per cent could read and write, but imperfectly, while 
13 per cent could neither read nor write. Their misconduct 
in the institution, and the number of their previous convic- 
tions varied with the extent of mental defect. Sixty per 
cent of those who were troublesome at one of the reforma- 
tories (Langho) were adjudged “mentally defective,” as 
against 27 per cent of the well-behaved. The duration of the 
alcoholism averaged eighteen months longer for those of de- 
fective than for those of average mentality (the difference
-P-A-G-E-308
  290 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
being the same between those of good and those of poor edu- 
cation). The average number of convictions for those of 
“poor” mentality was 28.8 as against 15.3 for those of 
“good” mentality. Sixty-three per cent of those who had 
83 convictions were classed as “mentally defective.” Thir- 
teen had been convicted 100 times each, one 115 times in 25 
years, one who could not read or write 178 times, and one 
who had a record of 3 convictions was actually found, after 
her numerous aliases had. been identified, to have 316. In 
England recidivism has been found to be much worse among 
female than among male inebriates. Thus there were 3 
women for every man convicted from 21 to 50 times, and 
82 women for every man convicted 200 times. Apparently 
the effect of alcoholism is more demoralizing to the nervous 
system of women than to the nervous system of men, un- 
less, indeed, the men are cleverer in escaping from the 
clutches of the guardians of the law. 
Treatment of recidivists. When an individual’s record of 
misconduct has convicted him of confirmed recidivism, and 
when the evidence shows that he is incapable of profiting 
from past experience or from attempts at adjustment or 
reformation, he should be regarded as “socially or morally 
irresponsible,” or as a “defective delinquent” whether or 
not he can be subsumed under any of the recognized abnor- 
mal or pathological categories (those of the feeble-minded, 
epileptic, or psychotic), and he should thereafter be placed 
under permanent or indefinite guardianship in an industrial 
or farm colony where he may be provided with profitable 
employment and wholesome diversion. To take such a 
step is but an act of benevolence to the unfortunate con- 
cerned and a measure of necessary protection to the thrifty, 
law-abiding members of society. A protracted record of 
social and economic maladjustment, incompetency, and ir- 
responsibility is of far more significance so far as concerns
-P-A-G-E-309
CONSEQUENCES OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS 291 
the disposition to be made of these individuals, than tech- 
nical quibbling regarding the exact form of the neuro- 
psychiatric diagnosis, or the insistence that the case must 
first be fitted into some smug procrustean diagnostic cate- 
gory. 
IV. There is an intimate association between alcoholism and 
feeble-mindedness 
We have already seen evidence of this relationship in the 
study of inebriates in England, about two thirds of whom 
were classed as mentally defective in some respect. There 
is no one who doubts the connection between inebriety and 
mental deficiency. D. A. Heron, on the basis of certain em- 
pirical data and certain mathematical assumptions, has 
computed that the correlation between mental defect and 
inebriety in the general population is about .76 (between 
.69 and .82). The question at issue is merely this: which is 
the antecedent and which the consequent condition? Is 
parental inebriety the cause of mental deficiency in the 
offspring, or is mental deficiency the cause of inebriety? 
Opposed schools of thought. There is, on the one hand, 
the school of investigators (usually frank Weismannian 
biologists), which stoutly maintains that deleterious sub- 
stances cannot exert any influence whatever on the germ 
plasm, and little if any influence on the developing nervous 
system of the embryo, fetus, or of the young child. The 
high incidence of mental deficiency or other types of neurotic 
or psychopathic disorders frequently found in the family of 
inebriates, they attribute purely to “neuropathic taint” in 
the ancestry. The offspring are mentally defective solely 
because of preéxisting neuropathy in the parents or other 
relatives. And the neuropathic taint is caused only by 
prior neuropathy and not by alcoholism. Neither alcohol 
nor any other toxin can produce an inheritable defect, or
-P-A-G-E-310
  292 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
affect in the slightest degree the heritability of a “neuro- 
pathic taint.” 
The Galton Eugenics Laboratory workers are typical ex- 
ponents of this viewpoint. A. Barrington and Karl Pearson 
insist that it is the want of mental balance (associated with 
emotional excitability from religion or race) and the exist- 
ence of physically strong natures, which are the antecedent 
conditions of inebriety — as well as criminality and prosti- 
tution — because, they argue, there is no appreciable de- 
crease in the mental capacity of alcoholics with age,! that is, 
with the duration of the drinking (the physique, however, 
being considerably affected by age). The correlation 
amounts to only .062 + .047. Alcohol modifies the relation 
by only one twentieth of its value, hence nineteen-twentieths 
of the mental defect antedates the period of alcoholism. 
Ethel M. Elderton, writing from the same laboratory, affirms 
that “drink has practically no influence on the general 
health and intelligence of boys and girls, and the little influ- 
ence it has is in favor of the children of drinking parents; 
they are healthier and more intelligent.” 
On the other hand, a prodigious output of memoirs and 
books has appeared in support of the conclusion that par- 
ental inebriety may cause: 
Various grades of feeble-mindedness — idiocy, imbecility, mo- 
ronity (Iwan Bloch, H. C. Marr, F. R. P. Taylor, Lamurien, H. I. 
Berkeley, Lonnett, R. J. Paris, C. C. Sullivan, Laitenan, Alfred 
Gordon, Alex Mac Nicholl, and many others) — backwardness, 
epilepsy (E. Kraepelin, V. Horsley, M. D. Sturge), impairment of 
will (M. P. Legrain), “constitutional asthenia” (Pierre Janet), and 
other degeneracies, neuropathies, or psychopathies. 
Various kinds of growth abnormalities or deformities of devel- 
opment, often referred to as “stigmata of degeneration.” 
An increased incidence of sterility, stillbirths, abortions, and

has no bearing on the effect of alcohol on the germ plasm or the embryo.

CONSEQUENCES OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS 293 
infantile mortality, the destructiveness being greatest for the later 
pregnancies among maternal inebriates. 
An increased incidence of tuberculosis in children, and colic in 
infancy. 
Various growth retardations, including infantilism, dysfunction 
of the endocrine glands, delay in dentition, lessened weight at 
birth, and retarded gain in weight after birth. 
And the inability of daughters to nurse their offspring (Bunge), 
even in the case of paternal alcoholics. 
It is usually held that the results are worse in the case of 
maternal indulgence of alcohol during the period of gesta- 
tion (W. A. Potts), or alcoholic indulgence at the time of 
impregnation (Langdon Down, Sabatier, Quatrifages, Lucon, 
Morel, Bourneville, Grenier and Wiglesworth). 
Difficulty of establishing scientific conclusions in the field 
of human transmission. It were rash to affirm that these 
conclusions, which are anathema to the followers of Weis- 
mann, have been established beyond every peradventure of 
doubt so far as concerns the transmission of human traits, 
The fact is, so intricate, involved, and complex are the fac- 
tors affecting the transmission of physical and mental traits 
in man, and so restricted are the possibilities of isolating and 
controlling any set of factors, that our knowledge of human 
heredity still remains largely conjectural. Where there is a 
complex nexus of possible causative factors, which is con- 
stantly found to be the case in tracing the origin of traits in 
man, it is impossible to determine with mathematical or 
demonstrable exactness the relative réle played by each 
factor, that is, to determine which factor or factors play a 
primary réle or merely a secondary or exciting réle, or no 
role whatever. Because of the complexity of the problem 
and the impossibility of segregating and controlling the com- 
ponent factors, human heredity has not yet been reduced to 
an accurate, demonstrable science. Certainly the conclu- 
sion that the human germ plasm and embryo are entirely
-P-A-G-E-312
294 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
immune to any pernicious influence from alcohol, or any 
other incident force, and that the cacogenic effects which 
have been observed are due solely to a prior “neuropathic 
taint,” the genesis of which is lost in obscure antiquity, can- 
not be regarded as an indisputable axiom of science. It is at 
most merely a scientific hypothesis based on observed re- 
sults which are “‘scientifically ” quite as explicable on the 
assumption that the germ plasm is subject to modification 
by virulent agencies when sufficiently intense and long con- 
tinued, that such modifications can be transmitted to the 
offspring, and that the immature nervous system of the em- 
bryo or young child can be injured by similar destructive 
substances. This conclusion seems inescapable unless we 
may arbitrarily conclude that the processes of transmission 
in human individuals, and in animals and plants are entirely 
disparate, for the observed results of human toxication have 
been experimentally produced under controlled conditions 
on various animals by different experimenters. Space per- 
mits merely a brief summary of the controlled animal ex- 
periments showing the blastophthoric effects of alcohol and 
lead poisoning (with a few of the more relevant observations 
of similar effects of alcoholism and plumbism in man), and

environmental stimuli. For brief references to the influence

ALCOHOLIZATION EXPERIMENTS 
C. R. Stockard, D. M. Craig, and G. N. Papanicolau in very 
elaborate control experiments carried on during the past decade 
have had young, vigorous, fertile male and female guinea pigs, 
proved by prior control experiments to be capable of producing 
normal offspring, inhale the fumes of alcohol from one to three 
hours a day, six days a week for periods varying from a few months
-P-A-G-E-313
  CONSEQUENCES OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS = 295 
to five or six years. Normal males were mated with alcoholized 
females, and vice versa, and alcoholized males with alcoholized 
females. The alcoholized progeny has been found to be inferior in 
fourteen or fifteen qualities compared, for example, in size of litter, 
failure to conceive, early prenatal deaths, late prenatal deaths, 
total mortality, abnormalities, oversize and average weight at 
birth, at one month and at three months. Among the deformities 
and defects produced were absence of one eye, absence of both 
eyeballs, opaque cornea, opaque lens, cataract and paralysis agi- 
tans. No such defects occurred in the non-alcoholized line. In 
general the greatest injury followed alcoholization of the females. 
The defects have been transmitted through several generations. 
In a recent article Stockard emphasizes that alcohol has a 
selective action on weaker or unfit germ plasm. There is an ex- 
cessive elimination of the weaker grandchildren among alcoholized 
animals, so that eventually the surviving animals produce superior 
stock. He believes that the nations which have indulged for many 
generations in the strongest alcoholic beverages are the ones which 
have outstripped the less alcoholized nations. Commenting on 
this conclusion, the editor of the Journal of the American Medical 
Association remarks: ‘‘Such extreme generalizations in fields where 
many agencies of man and nature may codperate or conflict in the 
course of the centuries can scarcely be claimed to abide within the 
range of exact science or even fully warranted hypothesis.” 
The results in the experiment of R. Pearl on the alcoholization of 
the domestic fowl did not seem to harmonize with Stockard’s find- 
ings for the guinea pigs. There was no lessening of weight nor in- 
crease of mortality in the offspring of two alcoholized parents. 
Stockard interprets this to mean that there was a considerable 
amount of early prenatal mortality rather than elimination of more 
resistant germ cells. Pearl, however, concludes that “the offspring 
of the alcoholized are as a class indubitably differentiated from the 
offspring of the nonalcoholics.” 
I. J. Cole and C. L. Davis mated two males with the same female 
rabbit, and then had the male with the fertilizing advantage inhale 
the fumes of alcohol for one month. This male now failed to sire in 
competition with the other male, but produced offspring again 
when mated singly. This has been cited as a crucial experiment on 
the effect of alcohol on the spermatozoa. 
Féré subjected incubating eggs to the vapor of alcohol. The 
result was 63 per cent of normal hatchings, 16 per cent of in-
-P-A-G-E-314
  296 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
completely developed embryos, and 21 per cent of monstrosities. 
E. Torelle found that small amounts of alcohol added to sea 
water did not injure the sperm cells of the starfish. 
Ivanow immersed the sperms of the dog, rat, rabbit, guinea pig, 
and sheep in solutions of alcohol, but nevertheless obtained normal 
offspring. Stockard says that the solutions used (maximum seven 
per cent) were not strong enough to affect the chemical nature of 
the sperm cells. Monstrosities resulted when Stockard placed the 
eggs of fish shortly after fertilization in an alcoholic solution. 
Wilson Gee in an experiment with the spermatozoa of fishes 
found that the difference between an effective alcohol dose and a 
fatal dose was very slight. With the right dosage abnormal issue 
resulted. 
A. H. Arlitt and H. G. Wells administered alcohol in the food to 
white rats for two or three months, and almost constantly found 
marked degeneration in the testicles, while other organs were un- 
affected. The spermatozoa showed all degrees of abnormality. 
Finally aspermia and complete sterility supervened. Stockard, 
using the inhalation method on guinea pigs, reported negative 
effects on the testes, but the ovaries grew cystic. 
A large proportion of stillborn and defective young resulted from 
the alcoholization during pregnancy of dogs in the experiments of 
C. F. Hodge and of Pfarrenger, and of rabbits and guinea pigs in 
the experiment of T. Laitenan. 
Nicloux and Renault found alcohol in the human ‘testes and 
ovaries in the ratio of two to three and three to five as compared 
with the blood. Lancereaux found that alcohol paralyzed the ova 
and produced ovarian degeneration. Weichselbaum reports that 
thirty-seven of thirty-nine chronic alcoholics showed testicular 
degeneration. Simonds found azoospermia in 60 per cent of autop- 
sied alcoholics. 
Lonnett states that 107 English women dying of alcoholism be- 
fore the age of twenty-nine bore twenty-nine vigorous children be- 
fore they became alcoholic, but after they became alcoholic only 
six children, all delicate or deformed. 
R. J. Paris reports that the children born to thirteen women be- 
fore they became inebriate were normal, while those born after the 
onset of inebriety were “weak minded.” 
C. C. Sullivan obtained the records of 600 offspring of 120 female 
inebriates free from tuberculosis, syphilis, or nervousness. 55.8 
per cent of the progeny were stillborn or died before the age of two.
-P-A-G-E-315
  CONSEQUENCES OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS 297 
The mortality was two and a half times greater than for infants of 
sober mothers. 
One observer found 6.2 per cent of stillbirths among the first 
births and 17.2 per cent among the last born of maternal inebriates. 
Another writer reports 33.7 per cent of infant deaths among the 
first born, and 72 per cent among the sixth to the tenth born of 
female inebriates. 
Laitenan secured records on 20,000 children in Denmark. The 
percentage of miscarriages was 1.07 among total abstainers, 5.26 
per cent among moderate drinkers, and 7.11 per cent among heavy 
drinkers. The infants of the drinkers averaged less in weight than 
those of moderates, and the children of moderates less than those 
of teetotalers (based on monthly weighings up to the eighth month). 
Information was not given as to whether the mothers, fathers, or 
both parents were alcoholic. An increase in national sobriety was 
attended by a decrease in infant mortality. Henri Schmidt states 
that during the period from 1874 to 1904 the stillbirths from each 
1000 conceptions in France amounted to 5.36 per cent for certain 
absinthe districts (southern part), 4.48 for certain alcoholic dis- 
tricts, but only 3.62 for certain non-alcoholic districts. 
Lxap Potsonine 
I. J. Cole and L. J. Bachhuber ingested lead acetate into the ali- 
mentary canal of male rabbits and fowl. The offspring from the 
rabbits rated less in weight and higher in mortality than the nor- 
mal. The eggs of the poisoned cocks developed less frequently 
than those fertilized by normal males, while the mortality was 
higher both before and after hatching. 
C. V. Weller fed commercial white lead in gelatine capsules to 
male guinea pigs and mated them with normal females. Care was 
taken not to overdose, and no impairment of the digestion was 
observed. The average litter for 32 control matings was 1.8, for 
84 matings of lead poisoned males with normal females, 1.9, and for 
27 matings of lead females with normal males, 1.7. The effect of 
chronic poisoning on the male germ plasm was the production of 
sterility in some cases, a 20 per cent loss of weight at birth and per- 
manent underweight, and a higher mortality rate during the first 
week. 
Rennert records frequent abortions, deaf-mutes, and macro- 
cephalics in mothers employed in pottery works in Germany. 
 
-P-A-G-E-316

When both parents have been working in lead the evils of lead 
effect the fetus and the continuance of pregnancy 94 times out of 
100, when the mother alone has been affected 92 times, and when 
the father alone has been affected 63 times. It has been shown 
that lead may pass from the mother’s blood to the fetus and from 
the mother’s milk to the child. Similar observations on the effects 
of plumbism have been made by Ballard, Lewin, and Bourneville. 
Abortions have sometimes continued after discontinuance of work 
in lead, probably due to the presence of the lead or the effects of the 
lead in the mothers. 
Constatin Paul studied (in 1860) the effects of lead poisoning on 
human fathers, and reported 12 stillbirths or abortions out of 82 
pregnancies, and eight deaths during the first year, four during the 
second year, five during the third, and one later in childhood. Only 
two children survived the first three years. 
Roques and Thomas Oliver have reported epilepsy, imbecility, 
and idiocy as effects of parental lead poisoning, the effects being 
worse when both parents are affected, and worse when the mother 
is affected as compared with the father. 
Transmission or Mopirications Propucep By Cotor, TEMPER- 
ATURE AND MorsturE CHANGES IN THE ENVIRONMENT, BY 
Moriuations, AND BY THE INJECTION OF ANTIBODIES INTO 
THE BLoop STREAM 
Paul Kammerer showed experimentally that when the pregnant 
Salamandra maculosa, which is oviparous, inhabits the lowlands, 
and produces from thirty to forty gullied yellow and black offspring, 
was kept in dry surroundings, the first offspring would perish unless 
placed in water. At the fourth pregnancy, however, the offspring 
were born as fully developed land salamanders, possessing lungs 
and limbs. In other words, the Salamandra maculosa had assumed 
the breathing habits of the Salamandra atra, which is black, lives at 
high altitudes, is viviparous, and produces only two young, which 
are land animals from the time of birth. It was further discovered 
that these habits were transmitted to the succeeding generations, 
Kammerer also found that it was possible to convert the striped 
form of Salamandra maculosa into the asymmetrically spotted form, 
and vice versa, by keeping the young upon black or yellow back- 
grounds, and that the converted forms bred true. However, if a 
naturally striped individual was crossed with a spotted individual,
-P-A-G-E-317
  CONSEQUENCES OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS 299 
all the offspring were spotted, the latter of which when inbred pro- 
duce a progeny in which, on the average, one out of four was striped. 
When, however, an artificially striped individual was crossed with a 
spotted one, all the offspring were intermediate in pattern, having 
symmetrical rows of spots. The conclusion was reached that a 
“new” (acquired) characteristic may stimulate, irritate, or influ- 
ence the germ plasm, while an “old” (inherited) characteristic is 
incapable of so doing. 
In a parallel experiment, Kammerer grew eyes in the sightless 
proteus (whose eyes have atrophied to mere rudimentary spots be- 
neath the skin through ages of living in deep marine caves) by ex- 
posing the newts to red lights in their watery home continuously 
for five years from birth. After several generations a group was 
born with eyes, the offspring of these also being born with eyes. 
In what he regards as his experimentum crusis, Kammerer found 
that the two siphons of the Ciona intestinalis (which serve for in- 
halation and exhalation) when repeatedly amputated grew exces- 
sively long, and that the offspring of such amputated individuals 
possessed greatly elongated siphons. When the posterior organs 
(consisting of a coiled intestine containing the genitalia at the rear 
end of the inhalent tube) were removed from individuals with arti- 
ficially produced long siphons, the remaining portion of the body 
built up the complete posterior part, including the genital organs. 
The progeny of such individuals also possessed very long siphons. 
From this experiment the conclusion was drawn, not only that the 
soma is capable of producing new germ-plasm, but that this germ- 
plasm may carry a tendency toward local growth derived from the 
experience of the individual instead of merely from some ancestral 
rudiment transmitted from the primeval past, and that these prin- 
ciples of transmission underlie the life processes of the higher an- 
imals and of man. 
Observations of human parental alcoholism, imperfect as 
they are, and animal experimentation thus seem to offer 
little escape from the conclusion that alcohol is a subtle, 
insidious race poison which may affect the germ plasm and 
the embryo, which may impair the more resistant progeny, 
and which may exterminate the less viable and robust. 
But this conclusion does not justify the inference that
-P-A-G-E-318
800 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
alcoholic indulgence invariably injures the germ plasm or 
the fetus. It is conceded that this is not the case. Nor- 
mal offspring and geniuses have been produced by inebri- 
ates. Even those who are not prepared to accept the 
above conclusions will admit that alcohol exerts a pecu- 
liarly demoralizing influence on the defective or deficient 
members of society who are addicted to its use. 
V. It is alleged that the feeble-minded are highly inclined 
to lead lives of immorality or prostitution 
Investigation of personal and family histories and of 
“strains of degenerates” shows that a considerable number 
of the mentally defective have at some time been sex of- 
fenders. Some go so far as to assert that all voluntary prosti- 
tutes are mentally defective. Indeed examinations of groups 
of street solicitors and inmates of brothels, girls’ reforma- 
tories, or other institutions maintained for sex offenders 
have sometimes yielded from eighty-five to one hundred per 
cent of mental defectives. Such diagnoses have usually 
been predicated on the fact of social delinquency plus the 
possession of an intelligence level of twelve years or less, the 
vast majority of such defectives having been classed as 
“middle or high grade morons.” While such estimates 
represent gross exaggerations, it is probably true that female 
sex offenders of the professional class yield a larger percent- 
age of mental defectives than any other criminal class, — 
due, as previously intimated, less to inherent erotomania, 
libidinousness or oversexuality than to lack of judgment or 
ability to resist temptation, to hypercredulity, reluctance 
to work, economic pressure, and victimization by the white 
slave traffickers and pimps. Probably only from fifteen to 
twenty-five per cent of the general run of such offenders are 
feeble-minded on the basis of a standard of mental deficiency 
which can be validated for the non-immoral type of inferior
-P-A-G-E-319
  CONSEQUENCES OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS 301 
person. Most of these mentally defective unfortunates 
could be saved from a career of social delinquency by the 
adequate organization of preventive and protective safe- 
guards. Such protective work would reduce the problem of 
social delinquency by a considerable amount. But there is 
no justification for the assumption that the segregation of 
the feeble-minded will wholly eliminate the problem of sex- 
ual misconduct. Feeble-mindedness is not the tap-root of 
sex irregularities. It is merely an important feeder. 
VI. Feeble-mindedness is a prime source of destitution, 
pauperism and vagrancy 
This relationship is self-evident if the diagnosis has been 
based on the accepted social criteria of feeble-mindedness. 
The root implication of feeble-mindedness is socio-industrial 
incompetency due to inherited or early-acquired defect of 
intelligence. The feeble-minded by definition are those who 
cannot maintain themselves independently in society. Many 
are, in point of fact, destitute because of inadequate support. 
Sometimes the parents are unwilling to render proper aid 
and supervision, sometimes they are morally or economi- 
cally incapable of so doing, and sometimes they have died 
and the friends or guardians are negligent. For these rea- 
sons many mental defectives are driven to the wall. Face to 
face with starvation and poverty, they may become mendi- 
cants, vagrants, impostors, panderers, incendiarists, thieves, 
and even murderers. 
Statistical data. Of 8813 aments from eleven represen- 
tative areas of England and Wales, reported by the British 
Royal Commission on the Care and Control of the Feeble- 
Minded, 40.5 per cent were in workhouses, training, res- 
cue, or inebriate homes, prisons, or asylums, or were receiv- 
ing outdoor relief. Exclusive of the children in school, and 
idiots, and imbeciles, the percentage was 67.8 per cent. Two
-P-A-G-E-320
  802 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
fifths of all the “feeble-minded” (high grade) adults were in 
the “poor-law institutions,” more than half being less than 
forty-five years of age. In the Manchester institution less 
than one fourth of the feeble-minded, as against the “vast 
proportion” of the normal minded inmates, were over fifty 
years of age. In the urban and industrial areas, 79 per cent 
of the “‘feeble-minded” were in institutions or were receiving 
outdoor relief, but only 46.4 per cent of those from rural areas. 
Tredgold estimates that about 18 per cent of the work- 
house inmates in England are feeble-minded. 
In the census of the feeble-minded made in Philadelphia 
in 1910, three fourths were found to be “paupers” sup- 
ported by the charitable agencies, almshouses, and institu- 
tions for the feeble-minded and insane. 
Of 105 admitted to the Chester County (Pennsylvania) 
almshouse, 100 were adjudged feeble-minded, while 75 per 
cent were so classified in the special survey made of inmates 
in Virginia almshouses. Many of these, undoubtedly, were 
dements, illiterates, and “borderliners” rather than mental 
defectives. Of inmates studied in the Indiana infirmaries, 
* 26.9 per cent were classed as feeble-minded and 16.1 per cent 
as insane and epileptic, while 37 per cent of 109 inmates in 
Missouri county infirmaries gave “evidence of mental de- 
fectiveness.” 
Possible evils attaching to the poorhouse system of care. 
Frequently the inmates are allowed to lead lives of idle- 
ness because the homes afford insufficient opportunities for 
wholesome or remunerative employment. Sometimes in 
small county institutions vice flourishes because of lax super- 
vision or inability to segregate the sexes. Frequently the 
homes become, in effect, maternity homes or lying-in- 
hospitals, to which unfortunate girls repair when in trouble, 
and where, frequently, they remain only so long as neces- 
sary, for mental deficiency or immorality usually do not con-
-P-A-G-E-321
CONSEQUENCES OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS 308 
stitute grounds for mandatory retention in poorhouses. 
Some girls make frequent trips to the infirmaries on the same 
mission before they are properly restrained by the agencies 
of society. Often these women are sinned against by normal 
men of the community, not infrequently by members of the 
households in which they are employed. In one almshouse 
in New Jersey eight women came for maternity care within 
a period of six weeks of each other. The superintendent of 
one county infirmary reported that 105 children had been 
born in the home during a period of five years, of whom he 
regarded 102 as feeble-minded (obviously a grossly exag- 
gerated estimate of mental deficiency). Sixty-one of 165 
destitute women (apparently regarded as feeble-minded) in 
an English almshouse had borne 158 children, of whom 21 
were classed as feeble-minded, 22 decidedly subnormal and 
delicate, and 19 apparently normal, while 96 were dead or 
missing. It is reported from the workhouse at Stoke-on- 
Trent that 42 destitute feeble-minded women had borne 78 
illegitimate children. Eighteen of 58 feeble-minded women 
found in the Weltshire workhouse had illegitimate progeny. 
In the Somersetshire workhouse, 61 of 167 (“all the feeble- 
minded in the area”) had children, two thirds being illegiti- 
mate. These homes were in rural sections. In 1889, 366 
“weak minded” women who had been leading immoral lives 
came to 56 workhouses in England. Thirty-three per cent 
of 14,725 women in the Magdalene Homes in England in 
1902 to 1904 (16 per cent of whom were reported to be feeble- 
minded), had borne one or more children out of wedlock. 
But these highly discouraging statistics probably are not 
typical of the total distribution of the feeble-minded. At 
any rate, the reported data are not free from discrepancies. 
According to J. L. A, Koch, not over 2 per cent of “idiots” 
in Wurtemberg were born out of wedlock, which was less than 
the ratio for the whole population. According to J. Carlsen
-P-A-G-E-322
804 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
only 5 per cent of “idiots” and 5.4 per cent of “deaf mutes” 
were born out of wedlock in Denmark as compared with 10 
per cent of all births. Ireland holds that “imbecility is 
scarcer among natural than among legitimate children,” 
while Lapage holds that there is more feeble-mindedness 
among the former class because the mothers are frequently 
feeble-minded. Goddard concludes that “‘there is a decided 
relation between illegitimacy and hereditary feeble-minded- 
ness.” He found 2.4 per cent of illegitimates among the 
11,389 persons traced in the investigation already cited, of 
whom 93 per cent were among those classed in the “pure 
hereditary group.” ‘The notorious cases of immorality con- 
stituted 2.5 per cent of all the persons charted and 3.7 per 
cent of those in the hereditary group. They were over eight 
times as numerous in this group as in the other four groups. 
Fifty-nine per cent of these cases were classed as feeble- 
minded and 5.2 per cent as normal. The percentage of im- 
morality reported among the parents of my 872 clinic cases 
amounted to 2.8 per cent, the incidence being 72 per cent 
greater among the parents of the feeble-minded than among 
the parents of the normal, retarded, and backward children. 
Undoubtedly the recorded data in all studies are imperfect. 
Many mental defectives born in wedlock are not reported, 
while many born out of wedlock perish from neglect or 
violence. 
Wanderlust or nomadism among the mentally defective. 
Many mental defectives have the propensity to rove about 
periodically or habitually from place to place. Even some 
with good homes are apparently impelled by the “migratory 
instinct’ to lead a nomadic existence. Some without homes, 
when forced to shift for themselves, roam the countryside 
looking for odd jobs or hand-outs, for the most part “spong- 
ing” on the hospitality of others. They constitute a class of 
restless, shiftless vagrants or itinerant job- or bounty-hunters
-P-A-G-E-323
  CONSEQUENCES OF FEEBLE-MINDEDNESS 305 
who are, in the main, harmless ne’er-do-wells. The British 
Royal Commission estimated that about ten per cent of the 
feeble-minded were vagrants, and that about ten per cent of 
all the vagrants were feeble-minded, most of whom were 
well-behaved and inoffensive, while a few were criminalistic- 
ally inclined. G. R. Johnson classified as “high-grade mo- 
rons” twenty-one per cent of 107 dissipating, unemployed 
non-foreigners selected at random from the unemployed dur- 
ing an unemployment season in Portland, Oregon. How- 
ever, while all of these men except three measured less than 
twelve years in intelligence by the Stanford-Binet, only a 
few fell below the ten-year level. 
Summary. The conclusion enforced by this brief survey 
is that the existence of the class of the feeble-minded is of 
vital concern to society because of the possible social menace 
of feeble-minded persons when left at large without proper 
support and supervision — and the vast majority are found 
in the body politic. The grown feeble-minded, while re- 
maining mere children in judgment, intellect, understanding, 
sense of responsibility, and self-control, have the bodies, and 
often the emotions, instincts, and passions of adults. They 
become anti-social primarily because of mental, moral, edu- 
cational, and industrial incompetency, because of lack of 
proper support and control when at large, and because they 
are duped, deceived, bullied, mistreated, and preyed upon 
by the human sharks of the community who are of more 
normal intelligence. While they cannot be cured of their 
mental deficiency and frequently cannot be reformed by 
the ordinary processes of reformation — arrest, conviction, 
fine, imprisonment and release — the burden and criminal 
menace of the feeble-minded can be considerably reduced by 
the adoption of an adequate, constructive, State and national 
program of eugenics, euthenics, and orthogenics. Two basic 
aspects of the program of prevention will be considered in

  CHAPTER XII 
ULTIMATE AIMS OF CONSTRUCTIVE WORK IN THE 
FIELD OF MENTAL DEFICIENCY 
I. Prevention and elimination rather than cure 
A problem of prevention rather than cure. Since mental 
deficiency in the vast majority of cases is not an active dis- 
ease or disability which can be cured by medication, surgical 
interference, exercise, improved nutrition, glandular ther- 
apy, or training, but is a defective nervous and mental con- 
dition which is amenable only to amelioration or improve- 
ment, particularly through educational processes, the prob- 
lem resolves itself primarily into the organization of efforts 
for the prevention, elimination, or extermination of feeble- 
mindedness. The ultimate objective should be to prevent 
or eradicate the condition, for the feeble-minded, as we have 
seen, constitute a racial liability — “‘so much excess bag- 
gage” — and not an asset. The economic and biological 
integrity of the race would be improved by the elimination 
of all the feeble-minded, although the presence of the feeble- 
-minded in society may not be an unmixed evil. It may have 
its compensation in developing the generous, sympathetic 
and benevolent impulses in man. 
Elimination of dullards. Some social economists advo- 
cate the elimination not only of the feeble-minded, but also 
of the borderline and backward grades of incompetents. It 
is quite improbable, however, that the highest interests of 
the race would be served by the elimination of grades of in- 
feriors above the status of the feeble-minded. There are all 
grades and types of essential work to be performed in a com- 
plex civilization, including countless simple, routine opera-
-P-A-G-E-325
  AIMS OF CONSTRUCTIVE WORK 307 
tions or tasks which can be satisfactorily performed, indeed 
possibly most satisfactorily performed, by persons of limited 
endowment and mediocre educational possibilities. Unless 
these basic forms of service are adequately carried on, the 
higher forms of culture will perish or become stagnant. 
Who would do the necessary menial or routine types of 
labor if all persons were of superior intelligence, or were 
equally educable for the “white-collar” occupations? It is 
notorious that the tendency of higher culture and education 
is to make people restless and dissatisfied with their lot in 
life, and to wean them away from work derisively referred to 
as “labor,” toward callings (“‘soft-snaps”) which do not 
begrime the hands, or soil the raiment, or require “manual 
labor,” and which therefore are thought to be sufficiently 
“respectable” for an educated lady or gentleman. Were it 
not for the presence in society of large masses of people of 
limited educational potentialities, the dangers to the state 
of overeducation would be as genuine as the dangers of 
undereducation. There is even now reason for questioning 
the advisability of raising the compulsory school age to 
eighteen years for all children. Even the educated mental 
inferiors tend to despise all but the white-collar jobs. Soci- 
ety as at present organized cannot exist without a large mass 
of workers who are willing to be “‘hewers of wood and draw- 
ers of water.”” The mentally inferior classes, if left alone by 
the propagandists and the misguided agitators of false 
economic theories, are quite satisfied to do the simple routine, 
but essentially basic, work of the world because it fits their 
level of ability. Society’s wide diversity of occupational 
needs will require hosts of workers of a wide distribution of 
mental levels, or competency levels, until the educated 
classes are willing to do all types of menial jobs at compen- 
sation commensurate with the limited degree of skill and 
responsibility involved. 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
308 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
Elimination a problem of preventive racial hygiene. The 
problem of the prevention and elimination of feeble-minded- 
ness is mainly — indeed, exclusively, according to the or- 
thodox view — a problem of eugenics, which Francis Gal- 
ton, who coined the term, defined as “the science which 
deals with all the influences that improve the inborn qual- 
ities of the race” — the heritable qualities. Negative eu- 
genics aims to prevent the procreation of defectives or de- 
generates, while positive eugenics aims 4 promote the birth 
of healthy, well-endowed, superior individuals. 
Proposed methods of extermination and elimination. The 
discussion will be confined to a brief consideration of six 
methods of elimination which have been advocated and prac- 
ticed in a desultory manner from time to time. 
1. Prevention of injury to the germ plasm or the immature 
nervous system of the embryo or of the young child by toxic or 
other destructive substances. Controlled animal experiments, 
such as referred to in the previous acter suggest that eu- 
genic or euthenic results may be obtained from the processes 
of human detoxication, that is, the elimination from the 
human system of poisonous substances. C. R. Redfield has 
presented challenging facts in support of his theory that 
positive eugenic results may even be obtained from con- 
tinued exercise. To quote from a personal letter: “It is a 
fundamental characteristic of pean in all of its forms” 
“that powers are developed by exercise and lost by idle- 
ness.” “There is no known limit to the extent to which 
powers may be developed by continually exercising them.” 
“There are sticking points of varying sizes at irregular inter- 
vals in any continuous development,” but all of these “may 
be overcome by exercise.” “I deny that there are any 
powers which cannot be developed by exercise, or that there 
is any acquired development of that kind which is not in- 
herited.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
  AIMS OF CONSTRUCTIVE WORK 309 
2. Prevention of the marriage of the biologically unfit. 
Many States have enacted laws prohibiting the marriage of 
the feeble-minded, epileptic, insane, and other types of de- 
fectives regarded as unfit for parentage. This measure is 
excellent in intent, and commendable as an expression of the 
deliberate will of the state, but it is not very effective in 
practice. Many unidentified or unrecognized defectives will 
continue to marry in spite of prohibitory statutes, because 
of the inadequate machinery for conclusive diagnosis, regis- 
tration, or certification. Moreover, many children will be 
born out of wedlock from defectives left at large in society. 
Recognizing that this is at best only a partial remedy, the 
emphasis is now being placed on more radical remedies. 
/ 3. Euthanasia, or painless extermination, by means of a 
Fatal anodyne narcotic, such as chloroform. This is still vigor- 
ously advocated as an economical, expeditious, and prac- 
ticable means of ridding society of defective strains, and asa 
kindly, painless measure of relief to individuals who would 
be a burden to themselves and to others, but it is rarely prac- 
ticed because of sentimental, moral, religious, and scien- 
tific objections. It is a waste of effort to advocate eutha- 
nasia at the present time. Society will not tolerate the execu- 
\.tion of defectives who have not committed a capital offense. 
4. Sterilization or asexualization, or the destruction of the 
power of procreation by operative procedures. The agitation 
for the unsexing of defectives and degenerates (for exam- 
ple, the feeble-minded, insane and epileptics, rapists, con- 
firmed criminals, confirmed drunkards, or drug fiends) has 
recently received added impetus from the studies of heredity 
and eugenics, particularly from the type of pedigree investi- 
gations of defective and feeble-minded strains which were 
cited on pages 274 to 280. But sterilization is an ancient 
practice, although it has not always been carried out for the 
purpose of preventing the transmission of defective stock.
-P-A-G-E-328

Egyptians, Malays, Hebrews (eunuchs), 
of Borneo and Java. It has also bee

possesses no eugenical advantages over less radical proce- 
dures, and because it produces profound physical and some- 
times mental changes when performed on the young. The 
Roentgen ray treatment is easy to administer, although it 
requires several applications of the rays, and is painless, but 
it has not come into extensive use because of doubts as to 
whether the sterile condition will continue permanently. 
Practically the only operative procedures now urged are 
fallectomy, or salpingectomy, and vasectomy. The latter 
can be performed in a few minutes, is painless under a local 
anesthetic, renders the individual absolutely sterile if suc- 
cessfully performed bilaterally (it is sometimes difficult to 
discover or to isolate the vas when varicocele exists), and 
does not, it is alleged, produce any inconvenience or mental 
or nervous disturbances. The originator of this form of op- 
eration seems to have been H. C. Sharp, who began to em- 
ploy it in October, 1899, in the Jeffersonville, Indiana, Re- 
formatory on various types of degenerates and on cases of 
onanism, impotency, sexual neurasthenia, hypertrophied 
prostate, and seminal vesiculitis. Salpingectomy is far more 
difficult to perform than vasectomy, as it requires a major 
surgical operation. 
Sterilization laws. The States which have at various times 
enacted sterilization laws are listed in the following tabula- 
tion (on page 312), together with the date of enactment, 
and the status of the legislation at the present time. 
It is apparent from this summary that, while nineteen 
State legislatures have enacted sterilization laws, the stat- 
utes are dead letters through vetoes, repeals, court deci- 
sions, or non-enforcement in all except five or six States, and 
only a small number of operations are being performed in 
these States. According to H. H. Laughlin, who has re- 
cently published a comprehensive summary of sterilization 
legislation in the United States and a discussion of various

questions relating to eugenical sterilization, only 3233 oper- 
ations had been carried out under all the above statutes up 
to January, 1921. Twenty-five hundred and fifty-eight of
-P-A-G-E-331
  AIMS OF CONSTRUCTIVE WORK 318 
these operations were performed in California, most of them 
on inmates of institutions for the insane. Thus far, the prac- 
tice has been almost entirely confined, so far as the statutory 
operations are concerned, to inmates of institutions for the 
insane, feeble-minded, and criminalistic. 
Arguments in favor of asexualization. What are the chief 
arguments advanced by the proponents of the form of ster- 
ilization usually advocated, namely, vasectomy? 
(1) It is contended that vasectomy renders the individual 
less unstable, tempestuous, or erotic, and more tractable 
and comfortable, sunnier in disposition, physically healthier 
and more vigorous, and brighter in intellect. Sharp, report- 
ing on 236 cases, says that he noted nothing but favorable 
results. Even when the operation occurred before puberty, 
there was no interference with normal bodily development. 
Many “high-grade defectives” in the Reformatory, recog- 
nizing their bondage to animal passions, voluntarily asked 
for the remedy, after observing the good results of vasec- 
tomy on their mates. According to the report of another 
writer, only five per cent of 106 vasectomized criminals were 
recommitted. 
The Steinach operation. It is claimed that in the Steinach 
form of operation, in which the vas deferens is resected so as 
to prevent reunion, and both ends ligated (tied) with a non- 
absorbable material, the interstitial tissue and cells of Leydig 
in the “puberty gland” (which is ductless and secretes into 
the blood) proliferate and develop in place of the cells of 
the generative portion of the testes (which accordingly 
atrophy). These interstitial cells increase the production of 
gonadal hormones, which stimulate the whole endocrine 
system, thereby improving physical and mental health, low- 
ering the blood pressure, increasing bodily weight, improv- 
ing memory (and sometimes eyesight), stimulating or re- 
newing ambition, increasing libido, and sometimes, although 
rarely, causing actual “rejuvenation.”
-P-A-G-E-332
  814 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
(2) It is easily performed, painless, and without danger; 
hence it is humane. Fallectomy, as already remarked, re- 
quires a major operation. 
(3) It is economical, expeditious, and certain. It is an 
effective and inexpensive form of preventing procreation, if 
properly performed, while some of the other methods are 
very expensive or uncertain. It has been claimed for this 
remedy that it would depopulate the institutions for mental 
defectives in a third of a century. This expectation of 
hyperenthusiastic eugenists is quite too optimistic, however 
efficacious the remedy may prove to be. 
(4) After having been trained in institutions to support 
themselves, wholly or in part, many individuals could be 
released without eugenic menace, which would relieve the 
overcrowded institutions and lessen the burden of care. 
However, vasectomy would not necessarily guarantee that 
the individuals thus released would not subsequently become 
immoral, criminalistic, or dependent. 
(5) The State possesses the moral and legal right to inter- 
fere with the individual’s desires, prerogatives, and practices 
when they are anti-social or dysgenic in tendency. The 
State now interferes with adulteration of foods and the man- 
ufacture and sale of alcoholics, with boycotts, unregulated 
divorce, free love, social immorality, and homicide. In fact, 
in the case of homicide it exercises the right to inflict capital 
punishment. It is argued that the greater right, namely, 
the deprivation of life under legal sanction, involves the les- 
ser right, namely, the right to prevent the procreation of 
defective, degenerate, or cacogenic progeny. 
Arguments against sterilization. The case against sterili- 
zation may be summed up as follows: 
(1) Sentimental scruples. The thought is repugnant. It 
shocks the sensibilities. 
(2) Moral and religious objections. It is inhuman. We
-P-A-G-E-333
  AIMS OF CONSTRUCTIVE WORK 315 
have no right to interfere with a sacred function or an in- 
alienable right, namely, the right to parenthood. Nature 
herself, however, does not seem to regard the function as 
inviolable or holy. She habitually sterilizes without com- 
punction those who will not live within the moral law and 
who become victims to venereal infection. 
(3) Legal objections. Legislation providing mandatory 
sterilization is illegal or unconstitutional. It violates the 
essentials of the Bill of Rights, section one, article fourteen 
of the Amendments to the Constitution, which guarantees 
the equal protection of the laws to all persons. It is dis- 
criminating and thus constitutes class legislation. It is 
incompatible with the doctrine of “individual rights,” since 
it interferes with the “personal liberty” of the individual. 
It is a cruel and unjust punishment or a punishment which 
has been added over and above that ordered by the court. 
There is ground for these objections, as indicated by the 
numerous vetoes and court decisions. Many bills have been 
defectively drawn, depriving the individual of the right of 
“due process of law” (that is, the decision of a jury after the 
consideration of the evidence, which is required in the case 
of serious infringement), discriminating between defectives 
in institutions and those at large, thus constituting “class 
legislation,” and enforcing the act as a punitive measure. 
In order to be legally drawn, the acts must make it appear 
that the operation is not inflicted as a punishment, but is for 
the purpose of remedial treatment with a view to enhancing 
the welfare of the individual and the good of society. There 
must be no discrimination between individuals of a given 
“cacogenic group,” or attempt to deprive the individual of 
a judicial hearing on demand. However, it should be re- 
membered that the Constitution does not vouchsafe un- 
limited personal freedom to any citizen. It is, on the 
other hand, the constitutional right of society to abridge the
-P-A-G-E-334
  $16 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
individual’s “personal liberty” and “individual rights” 
when they interfere with the rights of others or endanger the 
welfare of the state. 
(4) Scientific doubts. It is contended that we are unable 
to make approximately accurate, leave alone infallible, 
diagnoses of eugenic unfitness, or to frame a satisfactory 
definition of the condition, or predict with sufficient accuracy 
whether a union between two given persons will produce 
dysgenic, defective progeny. H. H. Laughlin has recently 
proposed legal definitions for “a socially inadequate person,” 
the “socially inadequate classes,” “a potential parent of 
socially inadequate offspring,” and a “cacogenic person.” 
He has published formulas which all but convey the impres- 
sion that the ratio of eugenic and cacogenic offspring result- 
ing from any union can be figured out with utmost mathe- 
matical precision, once the pedigree charts have been worked 
up by the eugenical field worker. But it is unlikely in our 
present stage of knowledge that these proposed definitions 
will be widely accepted either by lawmakers or by scientists. 
Under Laughlin’s model law, “all persons in the State who, 
because of degenerate or defective hereditary qualities, are 
potential parents of socially inadequate offspring,” would be 
sterilized. “Social inadequacy” is predicated on the basis 
of various social, psychological, and physical handicaps, the 
socially inadequate classes including such varied groups as 
the feeble-minded, insane (including the psychopathic), 
epileptic, criminalistic, diseased (for example, the tubercu- 
lous, syphilitic, and leprous), inebriate and drug habitués, 
blind and visually handicapped, deaf and very hard of hear- 
ing, deformed (including the crippled), and the dependent 
(including orphans), the homeless, ne’er-do-wells, tramps, 
and paupers. It is not likely that laws can be enacted and 
enforced which aim to prevent procreation by “potential 
parents of socially inadequate offspring,” when these laws
-P-A-G-E-335
  
AIMS OF CONSTRUCTIVE WORK 317 
are applied to all of these groups of persons, many of whom 
could be diagnosed as biologically inadequate only on the 
basis of social standards which, according to the orthodox 
eugenicist, have been bequeathed by “‘social heredity” and 
not by biological heredity, and therefore, according to their 
views, do not represent transmissible qualities. Moreover, 
the definition of a “potential parent of socially inadequate 
offspring” is not only long and involved, but predicates a 
“degree of precision which no one now possesses, so far as 
concerns the alleged cacogenic triad par excellence of degen- 
eracy, namely, feeble-mindedness, insanity, and epilepsy. 
We quote, for the purpose of illustration, only the first part 
of the definition. 
A potential parent of socially inadequate offspring is a person 
who, regardless of his or her own physical, physiological or psy- 
chological personality, and of the nature of the germ plasm of such 
person’s co-parent, is a potential parent at least one-fourth of whose 
possible offspring, because of a certain inheritance from said parent 
of one or more inferior or degenerate physical, physiological or 
psychological qualities, would, on the average, according to the 
demonstrated laws of heredity, most probably function as socially 
inadequate persons. 
So far as concerns the feeble-minded, it can be predicated 
with confidence that a body of assured knowledge does not 
now exist which will make it possible to identify with scien- 
tific accuracy two postulated groups, namely, the so-called 
“carriers” who, while themselves normal mentally, only 
transmit defectiveness; and the group of defectives who are 
of the non-hereditary type and do not transmit defectiveness, 
and hence are rated as “‘eugenically fit.” We are far from 
being able to specify all the conditions under which unions 
between the feeble-minded do or do not produce defective 
offspring, or the conditions under which unions between 
apparently normal persons will issue in defective stock. 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
818 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
According to the Mendelian theory, the offspring of a 
feeble-minded woman and a normal man would be mentally 
normal but simplex normal (that is, half of their germ cells 
would be defective). If such simplex normals married into 
normal strains there would be little eugenic danger, but if 
they married into defective strains some of the offspring 
would be defective. This is all very simple in theory. In 
practice, it cannot always be determined whether the condi- 
tion is simplex or duplex. Indeed there is no incontrovertible 
proof that the Mendelian formula has any application at all 
to the mode of transmitting mental defectiveness. 
There is a second scientific objection of equal moment. 
What shall be our diagnostic standard of feeble-mindedness 
for the purpose of eugenic sterilization? Where shall we 
draw the line? Shall we regard as bona fide “‘cacogenic” 
eases of feeble-mindedness all older adolescents or adults 
who do not possess an “intelligence level” by verbal tests of 
over twelve years, or over eleven years, or over ten years? 
Or an I.Q. of less than 70, or less than 65, or less than 60? 
It has already been shown what a tremendous number of 
persons would be feeble-minded under standards widely 
followed in the past. 
While these objections are well-grounded, it may be em- 
phasized that the feeble-minded — at least those who are 
clearly feeble-minded — should not be permitted to repro- 
duce themselves quite irrespective of eugenic considera- 
tions, for the feeble-minded do not make fit parents or bread 
winners. They are unable properly to rear children, or to 
manage or support homes. Sterilization would at least be a 
beneficent operation for all who are clearly feeble-minded. 
On the other hand, the attempt to prevent procreation by 
potential parents of the borderline and backward or dull- 
normal grades of inferiors would in all probability prove dis- 
astrous, because of the multitude of people in these groups,
-P-A-G-E-337
  AIMS OF CONSTRUCTIVE WORK 319 
and because these subaverage persons are fitted to do essen- 
tial types of low-grade or routine work which the more highly 
endowed disdain and refuse to do. 
(5) Doubts regarding the ultimate after-effects on the indi- 
vidual. We do not yet know, so it is alleged, what the effects 
will be after a long term of years, on the individual’s physi- 
cal, mental, and moral well-being. However, the evidence 
so far available does not show that any mental or physical 
injury has resulted from vasectomy. On the contrary, the 
results reported have been uniformly favorable. 
(6) Uncertainty regarding the ultimate effects on the moral 
and biological integrity of the race. It is feared that vasectomy 
(or fallectomy) may encourage sexual promiscuity. Since 
it removes the possibility of paternity without obliterating 
desire, it will not only not serve as a deterrent to immoral 
living, but will tend to further dissolute living and the wide- 
spread dissemination of venereal infection. It is held that 
the fear and shame of illicit parentage serves as the mightiest 
bulwark of female chastity. Although it is to be doubted 
that this fear serves to any considerable extent to check 
licentiousness, both because the natural consequences of 
illicit relations can be prevented, and because little thought 
is given to such consequences by “‘cacogenic”’ transgressors, 
nevertheless it is probable that this objection constitutes 
the strongest practical argument against the widespread 
employment of vasectomy. 
In spite of its great merits, society is not yet ready for the 
practice of sterilization on any effective scale. It is there- 
fore scarcely worth while to go to the trouble of engineering 
a strenuous State or national campaign for the enactment 
of sterilization laws. Even if enacted, there is little likeli- 
hood that they will be enforced. Until public sentiment 
undergoes a radical change, the practice will have to be con- 
fined to voluntary applicants.
-P-A-G-E-338
  820 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
(5). The Practice of birth-control. It is contended that pro- 
creation can be just as effectively and less objectionably pre- 
vented by the employment of harmless contraceptives as by 
the use of the method of sterilization. It is argued that this 
method, which now flourishes very extensively among the 
higher social classes, should be made accessible to, and even 
enforced among, the lower social groups, where its practice 
would be of eugenic value. It is pointed out that birth- 
control as practiced at present is distinctly dysgenic, be- 
cause its employment is almost entirely restricted to the 
better social and biological strains. It is possible that the 
active propaganda waged at present by two militant na- 
tional organizations for the removal from the Federal 
statutes of the ban on the dissemination of the necessary 
information, may overcome some of the objections vigor- 
ously urged against the practice of birth-regulation. Cer- 
tainly voluntary birth-control is greatly to be preferred to 
voluntary abortion, which in essence is deliberate murder, 
and which flourishes throughout the country to an extent 
little suspected by the uninformed. Nevertheless, this 
method would be more or less uncertain among the irre- 
sponsible and indifferent. 
(6). Segregation or colonization. This involves the seques- 
tration of male and female mental defectives, especially 
females of child-bearing age, in separate cottages or divisions 
of institutions or colonies, and keeping them under constant 
surveillance, at least during the reproductive period. 
Arguments for segregation. The following are the chief 
arguments in favor of this form of control: 
(1) It will eventually result in the effective prevention of 
degenerate parenthood. While this hope is overoptimistic, 
colonization undoubtedly would prove about as effective as 
sterilization, when practiced on the same scale. 
(2) The feeble-minded need to be institutionalize irre-
-P-A-G-E-339
  
AIMS OF CONSTRUCTIVE WORK $21 
spective of eugenic considerations, because, being indus- 
trially incompetent, they are an economic charge upon the 
community, while many if left at large, will become shiftless 
mendicants, or vicious or guileless offenders because of in- 
adequate support and control. In the institutions, on the 
other hand, their physical, educational, and social require- 
ments can be adequately met, and their energies can be 
diverted into profitable economic and social channels. 
There is considerable force to this argument if the diag- 
noses have been carefully made. However, the great suc- 
cess latterly attained in the paroling of inmates from state 
institutions for the feeble-minded proves either that the 
persons concerned were not feeble-minded or that the higher 
grades of the feeble-minded of the stable type can subsist in 
society and lead inoffensive lives, particularly when given a 
modicum of kindly supervision. 
(3) There are far less objections against this mode of con- 
trol than against euthanasia, sterilization, and birth control. 
Arguments against colonization. But there are objections 
and limitations even to this mode of control. The following 
are among the most serious objections: 
(1) We lack mandatory laws for the enforced commit- 
ment and permanent detention of mental defectives in pub- 
lic or private institutions. Very few States now have such 
laws. Parental ties, which are often very strong between 
parents and their defective offspring, will serve as an effec- 
tive bar to wholesale compulsory commitment. Even were 
the requisite legislation enacted, no court would in the long 
run be able ruthlessly to remove inoffensive defective chil- 
dren or adults from homes of refinement, wealth, or influence 
which are affording them proper nurture, care and protec- 
tion. The application of the laws would necessarily have to 
be limited to defectives who are improperly controlled, pro- 
tected, or supported, or who display criminal propensities in 
spite of good care. -

(2) The colonization of large numbers of mental defectives 
would impose an intolerable financial burden on the state. 
The tendency would be to commit many persons who might 
otherwise remain in society in order to prevent the contam- 
ination of the race by the reproduction of base stocks. Even 
now fully a quarter of the state revenues are frequently ap- 
propriated for the support of institutions for dependents and 
defectives. However, it must not be forgotten that the 
money thus spent often represents an equivalent saving in 
expenditures for crime suppression and poor relief, while the 
financial burden can be lessened by strictly restricting the 
admissions to feeble-minded individuals who constitute a 
criminal or eugenic menace because of inadequate guardian- 
ship when left at large. This is not done at present. Most 
of the institutions for the feeble-minded now contain many 
inoffensive individuals who are not even feeble-minded. 
(8) The inmates escape from the institutions or elude 
their attendants. But nearly all those who escape are 
quickly apprehended, and effective segregation of the sexes 
can be maintained in the institutions by adequate oversight. 
(4) Lifelong confinement in an institution would sup- 
press individuality and initiative, transform the inmates 
into unthinking mechanical automatons, produce neurotic 
disorders, solitary vice, erotomania, and suppressed mental 
complexes from sexual repressions and strains. But this 
picture is doubtless exaggerated so far as concerns the ma- 
jority of the inmates. Even if it were true, however, these 
difficulties of adjustment would be preferable to the evils 
incident to allowing mental defectives to enjoy unrestricted 
freedom in society. 
In spite of all its hampering limitations, segregation is 
probably the most feasible and the least objectionable means 
at present available for attempting to check the increase of 
defective stocks. Eventually the prevention of injury to
-P-A-G-E-341
  AIMS OF CONSTRUCTIVE WORK 823 
the germ plasm and to the immature nervous system, par- 
ticularly in the embryonic and fetal stage, by the protection 
of the organism from the destructive influence of incident 
blastophthoric and other deleterious environmental forces 
may attain equal, or even greater, importance. 
II. Proper and humane support, control, and training of 
the feeble-minded already in existence 
Since society regards the elimination of the feeble-minded 
by violent, albeit painless, means as intolerable, it cannot 
shirk the sacred obligation of providing the best support, 
nurture, supervision, and care for the feeble-minded already 
born into the world. These unfortunates are in no wise re- 
sponsible for their condition, and society is not justified in 
permitting them to be exploited for the benefit of its more 
fortunate members. 
A measurably adequate program of “euthenic” care must 
involve at least the following elements: 
(1) The identification or registration of the feeble-minded. 
It is doubtful whether a universal system of registration is 
feasible or even desirable, in the United States. England, 
of all countries as shown on pages 23f. and 35, comes the 
nearest to having a universal system of registration. A 
measurably satisfactory system for the United States need 
include only the feeble-minded who are delinquent and who 
give evidence of becoming a social, moral, or economic bur- 
den. ~ 
(2) Adequate hygiene and medical care and supervision 
from the time of birth. 
(8) Proper corrective and developmental training. This 
should be given in the public schools, except in the case of 
mental defectives who are viciously incorrigible or aggres- 
sively criminalistic, or who do not receive proper support, 
protection, or control at home, either because the parents
-P-A-G-E-342
  824. EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
are intellectually or morally irresponsible, or financially 
impoverished, or, although willing, are unable for other rea- 
sons to provide proper care. The care of a low grade child 
constitutes a heavy burden on the mother, often monopoliz- 
ing most of her time. Children who need guardianship 
under public auspices should be trained in well-organized 
schools in State, or municipal, or private residential institu- 
tions and colonies. All mentally defective children who will 
require institutional care after finishing the training pro- 
vided by the public schools, or after reaching the compul- 
sory age limit, should also be sent to these institutions for 
further training or employment. Mental defectives remain- 
ing at large in society should be given such aid, supervision, 
and support as the circumstances of each case may require. 
Essential requirements of a modern residential institu- 
tion and colony for defectives. Family life in a good home is 
the ideal condition to be sought, and not institutional life. 
The institutional régime tends to “institutionalize,” to sup- 
press initiative, spontaneity, ingenuity, and originality, and 
to develop stereotyped behavior, automatisms, and mechan- 
ical subservience as already emphasized on an earlier page. 
An institution is not the place in which to prepare children 
for extra-institutional living. Orphaned, abandoned, or 
neglected children who are normal should be placed in good 
homes whenever possible rather than in institutions. Since, 
however, there are unmanageable or defective children who 
require institutional control and must live their lives in 
institutions, society must insist that the institutions be or- 
ganized and conducted wholly with a view to the advance- 
ment of the highest interests of the inmates, and with a view 
to minimizing all the detrimental influences necessarily at- 
taching to the regimen of institutional life. This is the su- 
preme test of the satisfactoriness of an institution. The 
institutions exist for the welfare of the inmates and not for
-P-A-G-E-343
AIMS OF CONSTRUCTIVE WORK 825 
the convenience, comfort, or personal aggrandizement of 
the officers or employers. The sole purpose of the institu- 
tions is to make the inmates happy, contented, upright, 
efficient, and useful members of the institutional community 
(or the communities in which they may later live), and to 
protect the extra-institutional communities from the evil 
consequences of the ignorance, vice, incompetency, or crim- 
inality of those who must, unfortunately, become wards of 
the State. Every inmate of an institution is entitled to all 
the liberties and privileges consistent with his own well- 
being and the well-being of the other inmates. So far as 
possible, all must be taught self-control, and due respect for 
the decencies and proprieties of life and for the rights of their 
fellows, while they must also be trained to become indus- 
trious and useful, but they must not be exploited or abused, 
and errors and infractions of rules must be dealt with hu- 
manely. The disfavor in which institutions have often been 
held, is largely due to the abuses and barbarities which have 
from time to time been allowed to creep into the manage- 
ment. ‘The institutions are, however, better conducted 
to-day than was the case in former years. 
In order to fulfill the basic requirement laid down above, 
the following minor conditions should be observed in the 
organization and conduct of an institution for mental de- 
fectives: 3 
1. The institutional life should be made as homelike as 
possible. We should recognize the strength of the family 
instinct, cultivate it, and utilize it. The construction of the 
institution on the cottage plan will prove an aid in attaining 
this objective, especially if the cottages are small and are 
presided over by a sympathetic “‘house father” and “house 
mother.” 
2. The institution should be organized as a miniature 
community or village, with its homes or cottages for the 
 
-P-A-G-E-344
  
826 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED Nar 
inmates, residences for the officers, store, hospital, school, 
shops, factories, laundry, assembly hall or chapel, adminis- 
tration building, recreation grounds or parks, gardens, and 
adjoining farms, barns, and garages. Small farm and in- 
dustrial colonies for trained males and females, organized 
with the view of becoming wholly or largely self-support- 
ing, should be established on purchased or rented property 
in various sections of the district served by the central 
institution. 
8. The institution activities should be organized into 
various divisions or departments, including: 
(1) A custodial department which should provide care in 
segregated cottages for the helpless or semi-infirm. 
(2) A training or educational department, which should 
provide the necessary kindergarten, sensori-motor, aca- 
demic, physical, hygienic, recreational, musical, industrial, 
and shop training, which should be closely affiliated with the 
occupational department, and which should codperate in the 
development of the social activities of the institution. The 
institutional school possesses unparalleled opportunities for 
adapting the training to the peculiar needs of the children. 
In the institutions the habits and preferences of the children 
can be closely studied, while the children can be “tried out” 
in the great variety of occupational pursuits which are af- 
forded in the cottages, shops, and farms of a modern colony. 
The institutions possess a very great advantage in being 
able to offer employment fitting all levels of competency. 
The school departments of many institutions, however, do 
not meet the best public school standards with respect to 
the qualifications of the teachers, or the school equipment. 
(3) An employment department, which, as already indi- 
eated, should aim to place each inmate in the type of work 
for which he is the best suited, physically, mentally, tem- 
peramentally and vocationally, and which should aim to
-P-A-G-E-345
  AIMS OF CONSTRUCTIVE WORK 327 
apportion the labor of the institution among all the inmates 
who can be of any service, so that all may share in the ad- 
vantages of wholesome, profitable employment. 
(4) A medical department which should provide the neces- 
sary medical, surgical, and dental care, and the general su- 
pervision of the health habits of the inmates, with respect to 
food, clothing, exercise, bathing, and sleep. 
(5) A psychological department. If such a department 
cannot be established, one or more of the teachers should be 
trained to administer a few psychological tests, particularly 
the individual tests of “intelligence” and a few standardized 
achievement tests. The results of such tests should be used 
to supplement data gathered from other lines of inquiry. 
(6) Assemblies, including entertainments, band concerts, 
plays, movies, theatrical performances, celebrations, birth-: 
day parties, exhibitions, and religious exercises should be 
systematically planned for appropriate occasions through- 
out the year. 
(7) An administrative department which must codrdinate 
all the activities of the institution, and aim to make the 
institution, so far as possible, self-supporting. If the pro- 
ductive activities of various State institutions are properly 
organized and codrdinated, the institutions will be able to 
support themselves in large measure by the products of the 
labor of the inmates, with decided benefit to the inmates 
themselves. 
(8) A research department. It is not possible, nor essen- 
tial, to organize a separate department of research in every 
institution. All the departments can carry on investiga- 
tions of value if proper care is taken in the collection, record- 
ing, tabulation, and statistical compilation of the data. The 
prosecution of profitable research is one of the highest func- 
tions of any public institution, as the facts discovered will 
eventually contribute to the benefit of society in general.
-P-A-G-E-346
  328 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPFED CHILDREN 
One of the important duties of all departments at all 
times should be to report to the administrative authority 
the names of all inmates who appear not to be feeble- 
minded, or to be deserving of discharge or parole. To 
achieve the highest measure of success, the placement and 
parole work should be placed under the supervision of a 
qualified parole officer who can furnish adequate follow-up 
service.

  APPENDIX 
CLASSIFICATION OF MENTALLY 
DEFICIENT CHILDREN 
Importance of a correct classification. An accurate and compre- 
hensive classification or diagnosis of a mentally handicapped child 
is of the utmost importance, because it indicates the nature of 
the causation and the type of the remedial treatment, educa- 
tional training, and social care and guidance required. To the 
school administrator it indicates whether the child should be as- 
signed to a class for the mentally deficient, the backward, the 
disciplinary, the blind, the semi-sighted, the deaf, or the crippled. 
It indicates whether the child placed in an institution should be 
assigned to the hospital division for medical treatment, or to the 
custodial department for mere custody, or to the school depart- 
ment for literary or industrial training, or to the occupational 
division for cottage, shop, or farm employment. 
Logically, therefore, our first concern when a child enters 
school should be to give him a thorough physical and mental ex- 
amination so that he may receive promptly the physical treat- 
ment which he may require, and that his course of training may 
be planned from the very outset to more nearly meet his peculiar 
bodily, mental, and educational requirements. While we are at 
present unable to make absolutely accurate or thoroughly ade- 
quate classifications or diagnoses of children for educational pur- 
poses, we are beginning in the educational handling of children 
to approximate the stage already reached in the hospital treat- 
ment of patients. Some school systems now provide physical 
inspections and psychological examinations, of more or less com- 
pleteness, at least by means of the so-called group tests of intelli- 
gence, to all new school entrants. In addition, a limited number 
of school systems probably give such examinations to all the ele- 
mentary school pupils, and possibly all the high school pupils. 
Many school systems afford periodical physical reinspections, and 
physical examinations of all applicants for work certificates.

  332 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
Difficulties regarding the correct classification of mentally 
retarded children. ‘There has been considerable confusion in 
the minds of many students regarding the classification of men- 
tally inefficient children from the standpoint of type and grade of 
defect. There has been irritating ambiguity in the use of terms 
and discrepancies between various extant classifications. These 
confusions and discrepancies,are due mainly to differences in the 
point of departure of different systems of classification, to the 
complicated and obscure nature of the causation of mental defi- 
ciency, and, up to within recent years, to the impossibility of 
accurately measuring its various degrees by means of standard- 
ized objective tests. In the case of the living child, the conclu- 
sions reached regarding the nature of the underlying brain condi- 
tion of mental defect must ordinarily be based on inferences 
drawn from the observation of outward signs and symptoms and 
the facts discovered from prior post-mortem examinations of 
similar defectives. Personal and family histories are frequently 
so barren, obscure, or involved, that no unambiguous clues can 
be obtained regarding the nature of the agencies responsible for 
the mental retardation. Until recently, conclusions reached re- 
garding the degree of a child’s mental deficiency were also largely 
inferential. They were based on the child’s facial appearance 
(physiognomy), on the diseases and defects discovered in a 
physical examination, on observed behavior reactions, and on 
the child’s proficiency in school work. Too much dependence was 
at one time placed on the results of physical examinations. The 
nature of a child’s mental deviations or personality make-up can- 
not be obtained from a physical examination but only from ade- 
quate psychological methods of examination. But no sufficiently 
adequate psychological examination technique existed until 
within our own day. The invention and standardization of a 
multitude of psychological tests and scales and the elaboration of 
systematic methods of psychological inspection during the pres- 
ent century has made it possible to measure objectively with a 
fair degree of accuracy the amount that children possess of many 
psychic and psycho-physical traits, and to differentiate various 
degrees of capacity or incapacity or different types of deviation. 
Five basic types of classification of mentally inferior chil- 
dren. A comprehensive classification of subnormal children 
would involve a consideration of at least five basic fields of in- 
quiry. To adequately discuss all these fields would require a sep-

arate volume. The detailed discussion of the subject must per- 
force be reserved. The limitations of this book permit only a 
brief reference to each phase of the subject. Students desiring a 
fuller knowledge of the medical phases should consult the stand- 
ard treatises on the feeble-minded listed in the bibliography at 
the end of the Appendix. 
J. Cuassrrication or THE Menratty Dericrent AccorDING 
to THE NATURE OF THE CAUSATION (ETIOLOGY) 
From the standpoint of its causation feeble-mindedness may be © 
elassified according to the nature of the circumstances or factors 
which directly or indirectly produced it (that is, its pathogenesis), 
or according to the nature of the underlying abnormal structural 
changes found in the bodily tissues (that is, its pathology). 
1. Circumstances of the origin of mental deficiency (patho- 
genic factors). The causative factors are either primary or in- 
nate (or as they are also called, intrinsic, germinal, or hereditary), 
or secondary or acquired (also referred to as extrinsic, somatic, or 
environmental). In primary or inherited mental inferiority the 
causes have operated prior to conception, and have produced a 
defective germ plasm (the substance contained in the germ cells 
by which hereditary characters are transmitted). According to 
the orthodox view, the defect in the germ plasm is due solely to 
what is sometimes referred to as “neuropathic inheritance,” that 
is, the transmission of a taint inherent in the germ plasm of the 
individual’s ancestors. The most important of such ancestral or 
hereditary nervous (or neuropathic) defects are feeble-minded- 
ness, insanity, epilepsy, and mental idiosyncrasies. The author 
has reached the conclusion from independent investigations that 
the traditional view of hereditary transmission should be extended 
to include the transmission of defects produced in the germ plasm 
by vitiating environmental stimuli. Any destructive incident 
environmental forces if sufficiently virulent and long continued 
may modify the parental germ plasm and the modifications thus 
produced may be transmitted to the offspring. Substances capa- 
ble of injuring the germ plasm are referred to as blastophthoric. 
Experiments have shown that the germ plasm may be impaired 
by the entry of various poisons, such as alcohol, lead, and the 
toxins of disease, into the blood stream of the parents, and that 
the germinal modifications thus produced may produce various 
 
-P-A-G-E-352
  834. EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN | 
mental and physical defects, degeneracies, and deformities in the 
offspring for several generations. Defects of the germ plasm 
transmissible to the offspring may also be caused by a lack of es- 
sential elements in the parents’ dietary, such as certain salts and 
vitamines. 
The conclusion reached by the majority of investigators that 
most cases of mental defectiveness originate from_a defective 
(cacogenic) heredity-would probably be correct if the conception 
of heredity is modified and enlarged as indicated above. 
The secondary or acquired causes, such as poisons, infections, 
diseases, or mechanical accidents which injure the brain, act 
directly upon the body of the child after the union of the sperm 
and the egg. They may thus operate before birth, during birth, 
or after birth. 
When mental defectiveness originates after birth, the child 
shows normal or fair mental development until the incidence of a 
severe accident or disease. After this, mental arrest or deteriora- 
tion sets in, sometimes, however, quite insidiously. It must not 
be inferred from what has been said that all children who are born 
mentally defective evince obvious signs of defectiveness at birth, 
In the majority of cases the defectiveness only becomes apparent 
gradually as the child grows older and falls more and more behind 
the normal standard. The acquired cases do not ordinarily show 
any of the grosser “stigmata of degeneration.” These are more 
prevalent in the congenital cases. 
2. Structural defects in the brain tissue (brain pathology). 
The great variety of possible bodily defects found in mentally 
defective children cannot be expressed in a single formula, but 
the seat of the essential pathology of mental deficiency is in the 
brain (and particularly in the cerebrum and cerebellum). This 
applies even to the rather infrequent cases in which the origin of 
the defect is in some other organ of the body, such as the thyroid 
gland in cretinism. While the difference in the brain defective- 
ness between the lowest and the highest grades of mentally defi- 
cient children is largely one of degree, a baffling variety of condi- 
tions is revealed by post-mortem examinations of the brains of 
mentally defective children. 
The “gross” cerebral defects, most of which are perceptible to 
the naked eye, include areas of hardening (or induration or 
sclerosis), or softening, incomplete development, or non-develop- 
ment (agenesis), or atrophy of parts of the brain, cavities in the e
-P-A-G-E-353
  APPENDIX 335 
brain (porencephaly), defective development of the convolutions, 
diminished size and weight of the brain, and excess of cerebro- 
spinal fluid (which occurs particularly in hydrocephaly), Such 
gross brain lesions, however, are merely a minor basis of mental 
deficiency. The essential basis_in the majority of defective 
children consists of structural defects which are so minute that 
they.can-only be detected, if at all, by powerful microscopes or 
appropriate chemical stains. Chief among such “microscopic” 
defects are numerical deficiency of nerve cells (neurones) in any 
part of the external layer of the gray matter (the cortex), but es- 
pecially in the pyramidal layer of cells (the outer brain layer) in 
the prefrontal (and parietal) regions; imperfect development of 
the nerve cells in the same regions; the development of new cells, 
which are largely functionless; and possibly the haphazard ar- 
rangement of the nerve cells, although Hammerberg maintains 
that the cells are just as irregularly arranged in normal brains. 
J. S. Bolton finds that the depth of the pyramidal layer in the 
prefrontal region of the brain varies directly according to the 
degree of mental deficiency, while E. E. Southard and Annie E. 
Taft conclude from the examination of ten defective brains “that 
at least the brains of least complexity are correlated with the 
minds of least range, and that the brains of greater complexity 
are in a general way correlated with minds of greater range,” 
although they note exceptions to the rule. Hammerberg consid- 
ers that the stage of brain development attained by the idiot’s 
brain corresponds to the latter stage of normal fetal life, while the 
brain of the markedly weak minded (possibly the imbecile) 
reaches the stage attained by the normal brain during the first 
years of life. 
The brain defects to which brief reference has been made serve 
to explain the intellectual limitations of mentally defective 
children. 
The prefrontal region and the pyramidal layer, which are the 
least developed in amentia (feeble-mindedness) and the first to 
undergo dissolution in dementia, are the last to evolve in the 
evolutionary process. The pyramidal layer becomes the dis- 
tinguishing characteristic of the mammalian cortex (John Tur- 
ner, G. A. Watson, and Brodmann). The prefrontal region of 
the cortex (and the parietal, which occupies the middle division 
of each hemisphere) contains the “‘association areas” which 
stand in direct functional relation to the higher intellectual
-P-A-G-E-354
  336 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
processes, while the pyramidal layers serve as the physical basis 
of the “associational,” “psychic,” volitional and intellectual 
functions (J. S. Bolton). 
| 
II. CuassiFICATION ACCORDING To SPECIAL PuysIcAL oR 
Curntcau Type 
. On the basis of gross physical characteristics, most of which 
are apparent to the naked eye of the trained observer, mentally 
deficient children may be grouped into a dozen or more physical 
or clinical types. These special types should be of peculiar inter- 
est to any one interested in the care and training of defective 
children and merit adequate treatment, but space permits only 
the briefest reference to some of the salient characteristics of the 
more important types. The following are the outstanding types: 
1. Cretins. 
Cretinism is due to lack of development or functional inactivity of the 
thyroid gland, which is located on either side of the larynx and windpipe. 
When the quantity of the internal secretion and hormone of this gland is 
insufficient (a condition referred to as hypothyroidism), cretinism results in 
the young and “myxedema” in the adult. The characteristics, which usu- 
ally are not apparent at birth, include: 
A rough, dry, waxy skin, bloated appearance, a pendulous abdomen, 
scanty, coarse, dry, darkish hair, a large and long head, broad, thick hands, 
fingers square at tips, dwarfish stature, slow waddling gait, thick, indis- 
tinct speech, dull, apathetic, unobservant expression. 
Mentally they are listless, slow, imperturbable, placid, docile, imbecilic, 
but they may improve considerably mentally and physically from ingestion 
of thyroid extract, especially if treatment is begun in early infancy. Un- 
treated cases make little educational progress. 
The intelligence age (that is, the test age as determined by the Binet 
scale) of five cretins and four cretinoids (whose characteristics are less de- 
cided than those found in frank cretins) examined by the writer varied from 
two to seven years, the average being 4.8 years. The I.Q.’s averaged 43, 
varying from 24 to 68,. Seventy per cent were diagnosed as imbeciles, 
twenty per cent as potential morons (who, while rating as imbeciles 
at the time, would probably advance to the level of morons), and ten 
per cent as morons. The cretinoids graded somewhat higher than the 
cretins. 
A. C. (Fig. 14) is a sporadic cretin of idiot grade, aged 10.5 years when 
photographed, who, at the age of ten, measured less than a year by the 
Binet scale. His skin is rough, coarse, sallow, with purplish mottling, ec- 
zema on ears and genitals, scalp dry and scaly, hair sparse, eyes puffy,

abdomen prominent (twenty-six inches), arms and legs short, feet flat, legs 
held in flexed position. Has umbilical hernia. Under administration of 
thyroid extract, hair has grown thick, skin smooth and soft, and eczema 
disappeared. Walked with support at two, unable to walk, talk, and stand 
alone, or feed himself, but wheels himself about day-room in wheel chair. 
Very slow in movements. Can string beads and put pegs in peg-board at 
random. Notices toysand plays with them. Good-natured, but has bad 
temper, and cries readily when crossed. 
2. Mongols, on} g or Kalmucks. 
These children are so-called because of the obliquity of the eyeballs and 
of the fissure between the eyelids. The characteristics include: 
Puffy eyelids, frequent squint, a squat nose with flattened bridge, small 
ears, often crumpled and protruding, round face, chubby and often florid 
cheeks, deficient stature, a tongue which is often large, spongy, and fur- 
rowed, a short and broad head, with deficient occiput (back), square and 
broad hands, short fingers tapering at the ends, frequently incurved little 
fingers, large, clumsy, flat feet, a delicate and weak physical condition par- 
ticularly susceptible to naso-pharyngeal infections. They are liable to 
sudden death, and most are short-lived. 
The cause of the condition has not been definitely ascertained, but it is 
probably due to an arrest or perversion of fetal development. These defec- 
tives are often referred to as “unfinished” or “‘ill-finished”’ children, and the 
arrest of development has been ascribed to depleted reproductive power 
due to excessive child bearing or advanced age of the parents. But the 
ratio of the first, second and third born was appreciably higher among 
twenty-one Mongolians for whom the order of birth was obtained, than 
among 680 consecutive non-Mongolian clinic cases varying from idiocy to 
normality examined by the writer, while the ratio of the late born was de- 
cidedly less among the Mongolians. Almost one third of the last born 
among twenty-two Mongolians were also the first born. {The average num- 
ber of children in the families having the Mongolians, was 4.6, while the av- 
erage was higher, 4.8, in the families of 894 consecutive clinic cases of vari- 
ous levels of intelligence. While the ages of the parents at the time of the 
birth of the Mongolians averaged about six years higher than the ages of the 
parents at the time of the birth of the other feeble-minded children, the 
ages of the fathers of the Mongolians varied from twenty-three to sixty-four, 
and of the mothers from twenty-two to forty-five. Moreover, the ages 
of the parents of the Mongolians who were among the first born was not 
found to be high, as has been alleged. On the contrary, the parents of the 
Mongolians who were among the first three born, constitute the youngest 
group. Half of the Mongolians were born during the period considered 
most favorable for procreation, half of the mothers being less than thirty- 
five, and half of the fathers less than thirty-nine. These results do not ap- 
pear to warrant the conclusion that advanced age is in itself an important

i 
cause of Mongolism. It is probably caused by any agency which can pro- 
duce generative depletion or perversion — infection, toxication, exhausted 
or depleted procreative energy. 
There is no known specific medical treatment of recognized efficacy. 
The main reliance for improvement must be placed on educational mea- 
sures. 
/ Mongols are often superficially bright, observant, imitative, fond of 
music and dancing, and usually amiable and cheerful when intelligently 
handled. They often show considerable ability in reading, but little or no 
ability in arithmetic and limited ability in industrial arts work, because of 
their clumsy and incodrdinate movements. 
Ten per cent of thirty Mongols examined by the author were diagnosed 
as morons, and 86.6 per cent as imbeciles. Only one was classed as an idiot 
(8.3 per cent). The Binet ages varied from two to seven years, and the 
1.Q.’s from 19 to 63. The Mongoloids (whose physical characteristics are 
less marked) graded somewhat higher. For further details from this inves- 
tigation of various types of mental defectives, see The Journal of Delin- 
quency (1924), 169-95. 
D. M. (Fig. 15) is a Mongol imbecile who was 12.4 years old when 
the photograph was taken, and who had a Binet age of three at the age 
of 11.7, and an 1.Q. of 21. Can string beads, put pegs in a board, 
march in step, carry out one command, button clothes, imitate, but can- 
not tie a knot, and does not know colors or forms. He likes to pretend 
he is dusting and helping in the house. 
3. Microcephalics. 
These children are so-named because of the diminished size of the head, 
and because of its narrow and rapidly retreating forehead, its pointed 
crown (vertex) and flat occiput. They have a diminutive brain, with small, 
simple convolutions. They are often unreliable and subject to violent emo- 
tional outbreaks and motor restlessness, although often amiable and cheer- 
ful. They are quick and superficially bright, although low grade mentally, 
and frequently are imitative and loquacious, although their speech may be 
quite inarticulate. They are difficult to teach. 
J. C. (Fig. 16) is a microcephalic idiot, age 29.4 when photographed, 
Binet age 1.5 at age of twenty-nine. Head circumference 16.5 inches at age 
ten. Lower jaw prognathic, large mouth, hair on upper lip, eyes small and 
slanting. One brother a microcephalic idiot, and one cousin feeble-minded. 
Walked at three. Masturbates. Tends to mutilate hands and other parts 
of body, often rough with other children, playful, laughs without provoca- 
tion, makes quick birdlike movements of the head, likes to show off. Capa- 
ble of matching two colors, of selecting common objects by sense of touch, 
of dressing and undressing herself, although requiring assistance in lacing 
shoes, of carrying clothing from one place to another, and of carrying out 
one simple command, such as “get up” or “‘sit down.”
-P-A-G-E-359
  
APPENDIX 339 
4. Sclerotics. 
This term is applied to children who have areas of hardening (sclerosis) 
in the brain due to the overgrowth of the fibrous tissue which supports the 
nerve cells. The head is squarish rather than round, it is frequently en» 
larged, and massive looking, while the forehead is vertical, making the child 
appear impressive and more intelligent than he is. The so-called tuberous 
form is sometimes accompanied by rounded tumors in the brain cortex, kid- 
neys, heart, skin (adenoma sebaceum), and other organs. 
5. Hydrocephalics. a 
These children are so denominated because of the presence of cerebro- 
spinal fluid in the ventricles of the brain (internal form), or between the 
protective coverings of the brain (external form). The fluid frequently 
produces a pronounced expansion or a distortion of the skull, distension of 
the skin, and destruction of the brain tissue. The head appears globular, 
balloon-shaped or pyramidal instead of square (as in the sclerotic form 
of enlargement), the face appearing diminutive in contrast. The forehead 
tends to bulge forward, the eyeballs are often depressed, exposing the 
“whites of the eye’’(sclera). The head often undergoes gradual expan- 
sion during a period of years until it may measure thirty or more inches in 
circumference. 
Mentally, hydrocephalics vary from idiocy to normality, the external 
form producing less defect. They are educable according to grade of men- 
tality, stage of the disease (whether stationary or progressive), and associ- 
ated defects. 
The causation is obscure, but most cases probably develop after birth 
from chronic meningitis, or some other infection. There is no specific cure, 
and the outlook is unfavorable in practically all the congenital, progressive 
and ventricular (or internal) cases. 
O. D., the hydrocephalic shown in the frontispiece who classifies among 
the higher grades of mental defectives, had at the time of the examination, 
at the age of 17.8 years, a Binet age of 8.2 years by the 1908 scale and 7.4 by 
the 1911, 1.Q. 46, and in rate of psycho-motor reaction (Seguin form-board) 
measured 6.5 years, according to the author’s norms, whether based on the 
best trial or the average of three trials. She was very slow in her motor and 
intellectual reactions. In anthropometric measurements her percentiles 
were as follows: standing height, eighth; sitting height, thirtieth; weight, 
tenth; right grip, ninth; and left grip, eighth. Her head was large at birth. 
The head girth at eighteen months was eighteen inches and at 17.8 years 
26.5 inches. She did not sit up until eighteen months old, prior to which 
time her head had to be propped up with a pillow or supported by some 
one’s arm. Almost nineteen years old when photographed. At the age of 
twenty-two, after a few months in the kindergarten and ten years in a 
special school in a city school system, she did about third-grade work in 
reading and spelling, and second-grade work in oral and written language 
of ms  
-P-A-G-E-360
    340 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
and arithmetic. She did well in folk-dancing, fairly well in running, tactics, 
and marching, but poorly in mental and physical games, in which she was 
disinterested and lacked confidence. She did well in writing, brushmaking, 
plain hand sewing, and simple decorative stitching, and was excellent in 
sewed and woven basketry which she greatly enjoyed. Her greatest defi- 
ciency was in arithmetic, especially problem work, and her greatest ca- 
pacities in writing and music. She showed poor judgment, gave good 
attention, made good effort, but was slow to observe and quickly tired, was 
obedient and cheerful, but timid and shrinking. Has always shown lack 
af self-confidence. 
6. Paralytic (or Plegic) Forms. 
The types of motor paralysis to which these children are subject may be 
of the spastic variety (in which there is muscular rigidity and increased 
reflexes), which shows that the lesion is in the brain, or of the flaccid variety 
(in which the muscles are flabby and the reflexes abolished), which is due to 
a lesion of the spinal cord. Both sides of the body may be involved (di- 
plegia), or only one side (hemiplegia), or only the lower limbs (paraplegia), 
or only one set of muscles (monoplegia), The paralyses dating from birth, 
due to prenatal disease, or inflammations, or birth injuries, are known as 
birth-palsies (or Little’s disease). They are of the spastic type, and are 
more frequently diplegic than hemiplegic. Muscular incodrdination is 
prominent, as seen in the writing which often betrays wild, irregular move- 
ments. Children with birth-palsy are often subject to slow writhing and 
twisting involuntary movements of the fingers and hands (athetoid move- 
ments), which greatly interfere with the skillful use of the hands. 
The post-natal type, due most frequently to injuries or infectious dis- 
eases, may be spastic or flaccid. 
The mental level in paralytics varies from_prefeund idiocy to super- 
normality. -Eighisen ob 82 poF coat of trenty-aine consecutive paralytics 
of various types examined by the writer in the St. Louis psycho-educational 
clinic were diagnosed as feeble-minded, 7 per cent as approximately normal, 
and 81 per cent as backward or borderline. Of twenty-sev: i hil- 
dren of various types in the Dayton school for eri ildren, 18.5 per 
cent varied in 1.Q. from 56 to 74, 87 per cent from 78 to 95, $3.3 per cent 
from 99 to 121, and 11.1 per cent from 125-to145.—However, even some of 
those who are apparently normal in intelligence are more or less irritable or 
“emotionally unstable, or rather childlike or infantile. The birth-palsy 
cases among defectives tend to be of higher intelligence than the post-natal 
cases, although they are frequently judged more deficient because of the 
physical disabilities and grave speech defects to which many are subject. 
Many paralytics are capable of considerable literary advancement as 
well as improvement in motor codrdination.

ates to right, facial paralysis. Illegitimate. Walked and taiked at four. 
Convulsions involving the whole body since that time. Usually good- 
natured, but inclined to be quick-tempered, irritable, fretful, and stubborn, 
Cannot wash, dress himself properly, read, or write, but does simple, out- 
door industrial work that can be done with one hand, such as sorting wood, 
and picking up stones and papers. 
W. E. (Fig. 18), who has spastic paraplegia, or paralysis of the lower 
limbs, was eleven years old when photographed. His Binet level was 6.3 at 
the age of 10.4, giving an I.Q. of 59. Instrumental birth, with asphyxia. 
Severe fever at six months, feet drawn up. Talked when one year old, but

Can recognize toys, distinguish candy from wood and remove wrapping, 
and make marks with a pencil, and obeys commands so far as he is physi- 
cally able to do so. 
7. Epileptics. 
The most prominent physical manifestations of epilepsy, which is essen- 
tially a disease of childhood, are the sudden, inconstant, involuntary sei- 
zures or convulsions, which are attended by loss of consciousness. The sei- 
zures may be of the grand mal type, in which the child falls to the floor un~ 
less protected and in which the various bodily members are thrown into vio- 
lent contortions, the petit mal type, which is characterized by a momentary 
loss of consciousness, with slight localized motor disturbances, or none at all, 
the Jacksonian type, in which the jerking is confined to one member (for 
example, one hand), and the serial type (status epilepticus) in which many 
convulsions follow in rapid succession, the subject frequently remaining un- 
conscious during the series of attacks. Some epileptics are subject to auto- 
matisms (or “epileptic equivalents”’) in which condition they carry out acts 
with little or no consciousness. In this twilight state criminal acts may be 
committed apparently with little consciousness at the time of the crime and 
complete subsequent forgetfulness. 
Many epileptics suffer from various temperamental and emotional dis- 
abilities — such as irritability, contentiousness, fickleness, impetuosity,
-P-A-G-E-364
  842 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
sulkiness, irascibility, peevishness, anger, mendacity — and intellectual 
limitations, although some epileptics aa normal or supernormal. About 
two-thirds of 333 institutional cases and 47 public-school cases examined by 
the writer were classified as feeble-minded, some, however, being dements 
rather than aments. Epilepsy may be a complication of almost any type of 
feeble-mindedness (although very rare in Mongolism). Its tendency is to 
accentuate the degree of the mental deficiency and limit the possibilities of 
training. On the other hand, repeated convulsions may injure the brain © 
and thus produce feeble-mindedness, backwardness, or dementia in sub- 
jects originally possessed of fair or normal mentality. It is astonishing, how 
ever, how some brains are able to resist for many years the ravages of the 
seizures. 
Epilepsy is still largely a morbus incognita, though many of the predis- 
posing and exciting causes of convulsions are known. Many believe that a 
defective heredity is the underlying cause. The treatment is still largely 
symptomatic, the main reliance being placed on depressant or sedative 
drugs for aborting the convulsions, the regulation of the diet, outdoor em- 
ployment, proper social diversions, protection against falls, lifelong super- 
vision, and educational training adapted to the subject’s age, grade of intel- 
ligence, and the course of the disease. 
8. Progressive types. 
The typical feeble-minded child improves slowly up to the period of maxi- 
mum physical and mental development, and does not dement until the 
period of senile deterioration supervenes. But deterioration may, and fre- 
quently does, occur in epileptic and hydrocephalic children, and is a typical 
phenomenon in the two following types. 
Juvenile paralysis or general paralysis (Thoraas Clouston), which is a 
disease of the nervous system due to hereditary syphilis. The mental in- 
feriority may appear at birth but usually develops very slowly and insidi- 
ously until the physical signs appear (irregular, dilated pupils, absence of 
the light and accommodation reflex, fibrillary trembling of the tongue and 
lips, hesitant and indistinct speech, and developing paralysis of the limbs), 
when the dementia becomes markedly progressive. In a few cases the dis- 
ease may be arrested by early anti-syphilitic treatment. Dementia in . 
children without antecedent insanity or epilepsy is usually indicative of 
juvenile paralysis (or paresis). 
Stress should be laid on the fact that many children suffering from active 
syphilis (a contagious venereal disease) are neither paretic nor feeble- 
minded, but they are frequently more or less infantile, mentally subnormal, 
temperamentally unstable, incapable of sustained effort, and incapable of 
making the progress in school work to be expected from their rating in in- 
telligence tests. All children suspected of having active syphilis should im- 
mediately be given a proper blood test (the Wassermann), and active anti- 
syphilitic treatment when the results are positive. 
 
-P-A-G-E-365
  APPENDIX A 343 
Amaurosis or “amaurotic family idiocy” (B. Sachs), a type of infantile 
brain degeneration confined almost exclusively to Jewish children, previ- 
ously healthy, begins about the third month, and leads to weakness of the 
muscles of the back and neck, blurred vision, eventual blindness, and a fatal 
termination from heart disease or pneumonia within a couple of years. On 
examining the retina a light gray oval patch containing a cherry red spot is 
found in the center of vision. Fortunately the condition is very rare. The 
author has met with only two cases, Jewish siblings, less than three years of 
age, unable to stand or sit, and almost blind, out of over four thousand 
children individually examined in several States during almost fifteen 
years. 
A somewhat similar type of mental deterioration occurs among children 
of six or seven, previously healthy, and slowly progresses to a fatal termina- 
tion in seven or eight years. These diseases are assumed to be caused by 
some toxin. There is no known cure. 
Dementia precoz. Reference is made to this condition because it is oc- 
casionally confused with feeble-mindedness. It is a form of adolescent 
insanity (psychosis) which may effect both feeble-minded and mentally 
normal children after the onset of puberty, and which, in some of its forms, 
leads to emotional, instinctive, and intellectual deterioration, and conduct 
disorders. There is no known cure for this disease, although the hope is now 
extended that it may be prevented by safeguarding the child from the ef- 
fects of toxins and mental strains and stresses. 
9. Meningitic and Infiammatory types. 
Mental deficiency may follow severe acute infectious diseases, such as 
erebro-spinal meningitis, inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), and 
infantile paralysis, which may produce hardening and scar formation in the 
nervous tissue, and thickening and adhesion of the brain membranes which 
interfere with the cerebral circulation. Among 872 cases investigated by 
the writer, cerebro-spinal meningitis occurred 345 per cent more frequently 
in the personal histories of the feeble-minded than of the normal children. 
Unrecognized antenatal meningitis may be responsible for more cases of 
mental defect than is now suspected. Mental deficiency may also follow, 
although infrequently, some of the milder infections, such as scarlet fever, 
typhoid, diphtheria, or measles. Blindness and deafness are also possible 
sequelze of infectious diseases. There is, unfortunately, no medical cure 
for the mental defect after the brain damage has been done. The most im- 
portant line of advance in this field is to safeguard children from these in- 
fections. Diphtheria and typhoid can now be prevented by the adminis- 
tration of proper antitoxins. The educational prognosis varies, in general, 
with the degree of the mental defect. 
to. Infantile types (infantilism). 
Tke two most prominent characteristics of infantilism are sexual and
-P-A-G-E-366
  844 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
mental immaturity. These children are childish, puerile, emotionally im- 
mature, and weak and infantile in intelligence, but they are not always 
mentally defective. Some authorities believe that there are ten or twelve 
different forms or types of infantilism, depending upon the nature of the 
cause. In the so-called idiopathic form no definite cause is discoverable, 
while the so-called cachectic form is ascribed to a serious general disease or 
infection, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, malaria, or chronic intestinal infec- 
tions. The most definite and clearly recognized types are due to deficient 
functioning of the glands of internal secretion (or endocrine glands), the best 
known form of which, cretinism (or hypothyroidism), has already been dis- 
cussed. 
“Pituitary infantilism” is due to underfunctioning of the posterior lobe 
of the pituitary gland, which is a gland of internal secretion about the size 
of a hazel nut situated at the base of the skull. When this condition devel- 
ops before adolescence, the stature remains short, the hands and feet small, 
the beard does not grow, the genital organs remain undeveloped, there is 
an excessive accumulation of fat, while mentally the individual appears dull 
and torpid. 
Some authorities believe that definite types of infantilism may be traced 
to malfunctioning of the thymus (a small gland below the thyroid) and 
pineal gland (situated behind and above the pituitary), but this is ques- 
tioned by others. None of these types of infantilism responds favorably to 
the administration of glandular extracts except cretinism, although favor- 
able reports from the administration of pituitary extract occasionally ap- 
pear. 
It should be noted that only a few types of subnormal children display 
decided infantile mental characteristics, namely, the cretins, the Mongols, 
many microcephalics, and many paralytics, especially the spastic cases, 
11. Sense deprivation types. 
A child might remain immature or undeveloped and eventually stagnate 
as permanently mentally deficient because of congenital or early acquired 
blindness or deafness which has been uncompensated for, or uncorrected by, 
appropriate remedial and educational treatment. The marvelous extent 
to which the effects of sensory defects may be compensated for or overcome 
by the development of other sense organs is now well known. Had Laura 
Bridgman and Helen Keller been sent i an institution for the feeble-minded 
and been given merely the routine instruction provided in such institutions, 
they would probably have stagnated as feeble-minded and have remained 
unknown to the world. Appropriate training and instruction, if early be- 
gun, will remove mental deficiency due to sense deprivation (assuming, of 
course, that the sensory defect is not superposed upon a background of 
primary mental deficiency). 
Children stagnating as mentally defective, mentally inferior, or savage, 
because of lack of adequate and appropriate social and educational contacts
-P-A-G-E-367
  APPENDIX 345 
have been classified as “isolation” types or cases. The number of such 
cases in this country is probably negligible. 
Limitations and values of classification of mentally deficient 
children according to the nature of the causation and the clinical 
type. Even a limited knowledge of the nature of the causative 
factors, of the structural defects, and of the physical type of men- 
tal inferiors will prove of great interest and sometimes of consid- 
erable value to the practical educational or social worker. Noth- 
ing less than a comprehensive purview, which must include the 
question of causation in its various aspects, will prevent the for- 
mation of warped judgments and enable us to erect an adequate 
foundation for a science of the prevention of mental inefficiency 
and the increase of mental efficiency. Moreover, the discovery 
of the nature of the cause and the clinical type will sometimes 
give valuable clues respecting the nature of the required hygienic, 
surgical and medical treatment — as in the case of epileptics, 
cretins, and syphilitics — the required educational training, and 
the social forecast (prognosis), as in the case of Mongolians, 
microcephalics, or general paralytics. 
In spite of its high intrinsic value for an adequate scientific 
understanding of mentally deficient children, this type of patho- 
logical information is, nevertheless, subject to certain limitations 
which seriously minimize its usefulness in our practical work of 
ministering to the needs of the living individual cases. For even 
were it possible to discover the exact brain defects in the living 
mentally defective child, this knowledge in most cases would 
prove of minor value, because the brain defects are not removable 
by surgical interference, nor do they yield any reliable index re- 
garding the child’s mental level, or particular personality traits, 
or degree of educational improvability. There is, of course, a 
general parallelism between the extent of the brain defectiveness, 
and the mental defectiveness, but the correspondence is not com- 
plete or invariable. Post-mortems have shown that some low- 
grade cases have had no apparent brain defects, while some high- 
grade cases have had gross lesions. The chief handicap, however, 
is that our knowledge of the brain condition of the living de- 
fective is largely inferential. There is at present no means of 
discovering the exact brain conditions of a deficient child except 
by a careful post-mortem examination, and the very minute 
brain changes are not revealed by the techniques in present use.

The information derived from a post-mortem, moreover, comes 
at a time when it can be of no service to the living child. 
The difficulty of determining the exact causative factors or 
mode of origin of the child’s defect, is sometimes equally great. 
This is due to the paucity, complexity, or multiplicity of the ante- 
cedent conditions revealed by the investigation. It is frequently 
impossible to determine in the case of the individual child which, 
among the causative factors found, are primary, and which are 
merely secondary, contributory, or exciting, or purely irrelevant. 
Finally, only a small ratio of the high grade mentally defective 
or backward children belong to any of the special clinical or phys- 
ical types thus far clearly recognized. Lapage estimates that 
less than 10 per cent of mental defectives in general belong to 
the special types. Among 2774 school children individually ex- 
amined by the writer (see Table 3) only 4.7 per cent were epi- 
leptics, hydrocephalics, paralytics, Mongolians, and cretins. If 
we exclude cases among the epileptics, paralytics, and hydro- 
cephalics which were not classified as feeble-minded, these five 
types constitute 9.8 per cent of all the mental defectives of all 
grades included in the tabulation. The number of imbeciles 
among the special types constituted 19.4 per cent of all the im- 
beciles in the tabulation, and the number of morons among the 
special types 4.7 per cent of all the morons, as shown in Table 4.

III. Cuassirication Accorpine to PsycuoiocicaL CRITERIA 
Types of psychological classifications. There are two types of 
psychological classifications of deficients, the one based on quan- 
titative or psychometric measurements or estimates and the other
-P-A-G-E-370
  348 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
based on qualitative differentiations. In the quantitative classi- 
fication the aim is to rate the individual according to amount or 
degree of defectiveness, either with respect to all-round ability 
(for example, “general intelligence”) or with respect to any par- 
ticular trait (for example, memory or attention). When the 
classification is qualitative the purpose is to describe the quality 
or the kind of mental deviation found. For example, what is the 
character of the memory defects in the feeble-minded? Are both 
logical and rote memory affected and, if so, equally or unequally? 
Importance of this classification, It may be said at once that 
the psychological classification of subnormals is not necessarily or 
primarily causal. The exact delineation of the psychic peculiar- 
ities furnishes valuable descriptive data but may reveal abso- 
lutely nothing regarding the causes of the child’s defect; indeed it 
will not do so unless the causes are psychic, as is the case in at 
least some functional disorders. Nevertheless this type of clas- 
sification is fundamental for a proper comprehension of mental 
deficients, for three reasons: 
(1) The psychological diagnosis reveals at least one important 
cause of the deficient’s educational and social maladjustment. 
(2) Mental inferiority (or peculiarity) can be diagnosed only 
by means of a psychological examination. The degree of defi- 
ciency can at best only be inferred — and such inferences are 
frequently wide of the mark — from a physical examination, 
except in the few clinical or physical types, already considered, in 
which the associated mental conditions are well known. 
(3) The psychological examination gives important clues re- 
garding the degree of educability of the child, the kind of training 
needed, the occupational possibilities, and the required social con- 
trol or disposition. With respect to these three values the psy- 
chological classification yields more important data than the 
physical examination in the case of the feeble-minded, and also a 
large proportion of subnormals of various grades whose condi- 
tion cannot be traced to discoverable or correctable physical 
impediments. 
Various Criteria Employed in Psychological Classifications 
How shall we classify subnormals psychologically? The de- 
tailed consideration of the psychological methods of examination 
and classification is reserved for another volume. Historically a 
considerable variety of criteria or functions have been employed
-P-A-G-E-371
  APPENDIX 349 
in the classification of the feeble-minded. The following repre- 
sent, briefly, the most important of such classifications. The 
classifications based on single traits or functions, will be consid- 
ered first. 
1. According to contrasting emotional types or characteristics 
The classical classification groups all the feeble-minded under 
two headings: (1) the unstable, mobile, restless, excitable, hyper- 
kinetic, hair-trigger, psychopathic, disciplinary type; and (2) the 
apathetic, placid, slow, inert, asthenic type. But this classifica- 
tion is too rigid. There are many individuals who do not classify 
in either group. Some are rather neutral or indifferent, being 
neither very unstable nor apathetic, while others are of a mixed 
type, being sometimes excitable and sometimes apathetic. These 
emotional characteristics exist, in varying degree, in all kinds of 
individuals, normal and abnormal; but particularly in the neu- 
rotic, psychotic (mentally disordered) and feeble-minded. 
The so-called psychopath. Recently voluminous descriptive 
accounts have appeared of a type of child whose defects are 
chiefly or wholly emotional, “affective,” temperamental, or 
volitional; who is inclined to be restless, irritable, excitable, im- 
pulsive, deficient in volitional control or power of inhibition, lack- 
ing in the feelings of gratitude, pity, affection, sympathy, or 
social solidarity; who is selfish, morbidly egotistical, suspicious, 
frequently morally insensible, callous, incapable of feeling shame 
or remorse, viciously or criminally inclined, crafty, scheming, 
mendacious, frequently pathologically mendacious (lying with- 
out motive or intelligible end), thieving, wantonly destructive or 
cruel, sexually precocious or abnormal, sometimes sadistic (re- 
ceiving sexual enjoyment from inflicting severe pain upon the 
victim); and who is usually more or less deficient in intelligence, 
but may be normal or supernormal. 
The above characterization may seem to be overloaded with 
descriptive adjectives, but it does scant justice to the profusion 
of terms which have been applied to a type of defect which some 
believe constitutes the very core of character or personality de- 
fect, and the central defect in a type of individual whom they 
regard as the potential criminal par excellence and as constitut- 
ing the largest single group of the actual criminal class. They 
regard these individuals as abnormal if not pathological, well- 
nigh incurably anti-social, and partly or wholly irresponsible.
-P-A-G-E-372
350 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
Equivalent terms and assumptions. Various terms have at 
different times been applied to this type of personality defect: 
constitutional immorality (Tanzig); moral insanity (Miiller, 
Mendel, Tiling); moral idiocy (Brunet); moral imbecility (Groh- 
mann); psychopathy, or psychopathic or constitutional inferior- 
ity. An English statute has for over two decades given legal 
sanction to the concept of moral imbecility. Moral imbeciles are 
defined as “persons who from early age display some permanent 
mental defect coupled with strong vicious or criminal propen- 
sities on which punishment has little or no deterrent effect.”” The 
underlying assumption has generally been that these children, 
especially when vicious tendencies have appeared early in life 
(and some would not employ the category unless the tendencies 
did appear early), are congenitally defective in the instincts, im- 
pulses, feelings and sentiments which are at the base of the 
so-called moral sense, and that therefore the anti-social tenden- 
cies are largely ineradicable. Some believe that these children 
suffer from a specific moral or ethical defect: they are “‘ morally 
color blind.” 
Criticism. It may be doubted whether there are any real 
moral imbeciles. In my block of 2774 consecutive clinic cases 
only one was diagnosed as a “moral imbecile” (though more had 
been so reported), but his conduct so improved in the course of a 
few years as to render the diagnosis questionable. Among the 
feeble-minded, only one per cent are moral imbeciles, according 
to Mary Dendy; only five per cent are “vicious, immoral and 
anti-social,” according to A. Eichholz; and less than four per cent 
of the feeble-minded in “lunatic asylums” are “morally defec- 
tive,” according to the 1909 report of the Commissioners in 
Lunacy in England. James Kerr considers that the prevalence 
of moral imbecility is very small and W. C. Sullivan that only a 
“very small amount” of juvenile criminality can be attributed to 
it. Ménksmiller, however, classified as moral imbeciles thirteen 
of two hundred young offenders examined in the Lichtenberg 
reformatory. Most of these cases probably were feeble-minded, 
insane, epileptic, hysterical, or psychopathic. In America, where 
the terms moral imbecility, moral idiocy, moral insanity or consti- 
tutional immorality have not come into considerable vogue, a 
strong tendency has recently set in to classify under such cate- 
gories as psychopathy (less frequently neuropathy), psychopathic 
inferiority, or constitutional inferiority, all individuals who dis- 
 
-P-A-G-E-373
  APPENDIX 351 
play emotional, instinctive, temperamental or volitional defects. 
This is especially the case when they evince criminal propensities, 
and when they cannot be classified as outspokenly psychotic 
(insane), or psychoneurotic (neurasthenic, hysterical, psychas- 
thenic, migrainous), or epileptic, or feeble-minded (though some 
are classed as both feeble-minded and psychopathic). Not many 
authorities, however, are yet agreed as to whether there is a 
definite nosological or diseased entity corresponding to these 
terms, or whether they are merely convenient, descriptive terms 
for a group of ill-defined symptoms not classifiable under any of 
the recognized categories. Certainly wide differences exist in the 
extent of the practical employment of the concept of psychopathy 
by different examiners of defectives and delinquents. Some find 
an abundance of psychopaths; others very few or none at all. 
Among my 2774 clinic cases only 1.2 per cent were diagnosed as 
psychopathic, although sixteen per cent were reported as subject 
in some measure to some form of misconduct. But far more, 
namely, seven per cent, were classified as nervous or neurotic. 
Until more is known regarding the “psychopath,” it seems pre- 
ferable to apply the term “defective delinquent” (Walter Fer- 
nald) as a convenient descriptive designation free from unveri- 
fied underlying nosological assumptions, to delinquents who, 
because of the strength of their vicious propensities, are in need 
of supervision or control for an indefinite period and who cannot 
be diagnosed as feeble-minded, insane, or epileptic. 
2. According to differences in motor capacity. 
Hack Tuke classified the feeble-minded into (1) those capable 
of reflex movements only, (2) those capable of ideo-motor and 
emotional responses, and (3) those capable of volitional acts. 
Such a classification, while suggestive, is not sufficiently precise 
to be of much practical service for determining the efficiency of 
the motor apparatus or for properly grading and differentiating 
the motor or psychomotor capacities and peculiarities of sub- 
normals. In order to provide standardized tests for this purpose 
psychologists have devised a large number of tests designed to 
measure speed, extent, precision and steadiness of movement, 
motor codrdination, form discrimination, constructive ability, 
resolution, determination; ability to follow instructions, to plan, 
to analyze objective situations, and to adapt means to ends, gen- 
eral motor ability or motor age, the amount of skill possessed in
-P-A-G-E-374
ce eT eee te nee 
352 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
specialized lines of craftsmanship, and the individual’s “will- 
temperament” or volitional pattern. The progress in this field 
has been so rapid that scores of so-called form-board, construc- 
tion, puzzle, and mechanical-ingenuity tests are now available. 
Discussion of the individual tests must be reserved for another 
volume. 
3. According to the power of judgment or common sense (Hoff- 
bauer, and Binet). 
Binet emphasized that one of the fundamental defects in the 
whole group of the feeble-minded was lack of “‘common sense” or 
good judgment. ‘This criterion is indeed more fundamental than 
mere erudition or even the intelligence level, for no matter how 
ignorant or otherwise defective an individual may be, he cannot 
be considered feeble-minded if he shows good judgment in the 
practical work-a-day situations of life. Many individuals who 
cannot qualify in the standardized intelligence tests of the con- 
ventional type have enough acumen or practical sense to manage 
their affairs with passable success. Although no definite scale of 
tests has been devised by which to measure the soundness or de- 
gree of maturity of judgment (unless the general intelligence tests 
do this indirectly), nevertheless the individual’s ability to an- 
alyze, understand, originate, infer, judge and reason can be esti- 
mated and observed in many intelligence and performance tests, 
many practical situations of life, and in a few tests specifically 
designed to measure initiative, judgment and common sense. 
Thus, to refer to only two of the older non-technical tests of 
“common sense”: The suspected mental defective is told to sit 
down on a chair previously turned upside down, or to put on a 
coat previously turned inside out, and notation is made of whether 
the child has enough sense to right the chair or adjust the coat 
before proceeding to carry out the request. 
4. According to the power of attention. 
One of the earliest tests of the degree of trainability of mental 
defectives was the so-called “fixation test” in which the child’s 
eyes were stimulated by a bright light in a darkened room. If, 
instead of staring vacantly into space, the child was able to fixate 
the stationary light, and especially to follow with the eyes the 
light when moved about, he was considered to be trainable and 
to be a fit candidate for a training institution.
-P-A-G-E-375
APPENDIX 353 
P. Sollier classified defectives on the basis of degree of attention 
defect into (a) absolute idiots, in whom attention is completely 
absent, (b) simple idiots in whom it is feeble and difficult to 
elicit, and (c) imbeciles, in whom it is unstable. 
Value of criterion. This is one of the most valuable of the 
single criteria of mental deficiency. There is generally a fair cor- 
respondence between the strength of voluntary attention and the 
amount of mentality and degree of trainability. In general, the 
more pronounced the intelligence defect, the more difficult it is to 
secure and hold the attention. The lower grades of mental de- 
fectives are largely incapable of other than instinctive or passive 
attention. Voluntary attention is aroused and held with extreme 
difficulty. Attention constantly roves in idiots. Imbeciles attend 
voluntarily for only brief periods of time; they quickly tire, and 
are constantly distracted by all sorts of trivial occurrences. Their 
attention possesses little depth or persistence, and little tendency 
toward spontaneous return after distraction. Morons are ca- 
pable of voluntary attention, but cannot concentrate for long on 
abstractions. They are easily distracted but will spontaneously 
return to their assigned tasks. Backward and delinquent chil- 
dren are often listless and inattentive because disinterested in the 
subject matter. They often fatigue rapidly but the fatigue may 
be due to boredom, and is more apparent than real. The train- 
able animals are those whose attention can be elicited and held. 
The young infant makes little mental progress until the roving 
eyes can be fixed, and the attention caught. In fact, attention 
is coterminous, and almost synonymous, with consciousness. 
Wherever there is consciousness there is a modicum of attention. 
It is a good practice for every teacher to observe the character- 
istics of the child’s attention: the readiness with which it can be 
aroused, its depth, persistence, ease of distractibility, and tend- 
ency to return spontaneously after distraction. The inability of 
the child to concentrate or to sustain attention is a suspicious 
sign, suggestive of obstructed breathing (producing aprosexia), or 
poor circulation, or malnutrition, or mental deficiency, or nerv- 
ous, emotional, and volitional instability, or lack of interest, or 
absorption in other pursuits. Aprosexia has been applied to inat- 
tention due to physical defects, such as obstructed breathing. 
Limitations. Nevertheless, valuable as this criterion is, the 
correlation between degree of attention and grade of mentality or 
intelligence is not perfect. The neurasthenic works rapidly and
-P-A-G-E-376
  854 KDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
energetically, possessing considerable depth of attention, but is 
quickly exhausted, possessing little persistency of attention. 
Although the neurasthenic may be highly intelligent, attention 
soon flags. The attention in many psychotics is highly distract- 
able although there is little evidence of intellectual deterioration. 
Fatigue, lack of sleep, lack of interest, emotional disturbances, 
malnutrition, obstructed breathing, and a stuffy atmosphere may 
induce inattention even in the brilliant. It is also possible that 
specific volitional or attention defects may exist without obvious 
intellectual defects. 
5. According to degree of speech development or speech de- 
fectiveness. | 
Esquirol divided the feeble-minded into three grades on the 
basis of speech ability: (1) the mutes, who cannot produce any 
sounds at all, (2) those who can only utter cries or monosyllables, 
and (8) those who ean form words, or form short detached 
phrases, or broken sentences. In my experience absolute mutes 
are exceedingly rare among the feeble-minded, while the highest 
grades can express themselves in complete sentences, at least 
short sentences, unless the thought is complicated. — 
In the classification of Alfred Binet and Th. Simon, the idiot 
cannot talk, the imbecile can speak but cannot communicate in 
writing, while the débile (a moron reaching a maximum méntal- 
ity of nine years) can speak, read, and write. 
G. Makuen regards speech development and the ability to im- 
prove from speech training as one of the best diagnostic tests of 
feeble-mindedness. 
There is in general a fairly close correspondence between the 
degree of intelligence and the power of expression, the stage of 
speech development and the incidence of speech defects. The 
muscles of articulation are par excellence the ‘‘mental muscles,” 
the muscles chiefly employed by civilized man for giving expres- 
sion to thoughts and feelings. But properly to codrdinate the 
delicate and complicated neuromuscular apparatus of speech 
requires a higher order of mentality than to use any other set of 
muscles. So delicate is the speech mechanism that thousands of 
variations of sound can be produced by slight eae in 
the tension and movements of the speech musculature. Because 
of the complexity and delicacy of the numerous psychic, sensory 
and motor codrdinations involved, the control of the speech 
 
-P-A-G-E-377
EE ee ee ee ee eT a eee 
APPENDIX 855 
mechanism develops but slowly, and is easily disturbed, produc- 
ing various speech disorders and defects. We do find, in point 
of fact, that speech delays and defects occur more frequently in 
subnormals. 
C. D. Mead found that the average age when 25 sons and 25 
‘ daughters of Columbia University graduate students were able 
to “use a word intelligently” was 15.7 months, with an extreme 
range of from 9 to 25 months, while the median for 92 institu- 
tional cases of mental defectives (probably of the higher grades) 
was 34.2 months, with an extreme range of from 12 to 156 months. 
Lapage found that 61 high grade mental defectives began to 
talk at 1.8 years, and 50 low grade at 3.5 years, that 88 had good 
: speech at 1.9 years, and that 64 had defective speech at 3.2 years. 
The writer found that 278 normal children (that is, not feeble- 
minded, although some were backward) first used single words at 
1 year (the upper limit being 4 years), 272 subnormal children at 
1.8 years, and 164 feeble-minded children at 2 years (with an 
upper limit of 7 years), the age being 1.6 years for the morons and 
2.3 years for the imbeciles. The normals first used short phrases 
or sentences at 1.7 years (with an upper limit of 8 years), the sub- 
normals at 2.6 years, and the feeble-minded at 3 years (with an 
extreme of 11 years), the corresponding figures for the morons 
and imbeciles being 2.3 and 3.7. 
The writer’s speech investigations in the St. Louis schools 
showed that there were over nine times as many speech defects 
among the children in the special schools for the mentally defec- 
tive and seven times as many among the children examined in the 
| clinic (about ninety per cent of whom were more or less sub- 
normal, and about thirty-five per cent feeble-minded), as were 
found among the pupils in the regular elementary and high school 
grades (see p. 246). 
Notable delay in talking constitutes a presumption of mental 
defect in the absence of an adequate specific cause. A child who 
cannot speak at six or seven, or one who is still talking baby talk, 
or lisping, or slurring badly, is probably feeble-minded unless the 
speech delay or defect can be traced to deafness, impaired hear- 
y ing, motor aphasia, paralysis of the speech muscles, or lack of 
opportunities for acquiring speech. However, the converse con- 
clusion, namely, that a child is mentally normal because he can 
talk glibly or fluently, does not follow. There are imbeciles who 
possess amazing fertility of expression and are exceedingly loqua- 
 
-P-A-G-E-378
856 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED C: REN 
cious. But, while they are perfect chatterboxes, their speech is 
largely made up of inconsequential jabber, logorrhea, or confabu- 
lations. They are merely good pollies. | 
Valuable as the above criteria may be in the classification of 
subnormal children they are quite subsidiary to the general men- 
tal capacity of the individual. 4 
6. According to general mental feebleness or general level of 
intelligence. 
This type of classification, which has recently become domi- 
nant because of the development of the so-called graded scales of 
intelligence, was probably presupposed or implied in the classifi- 
cations of some of the older writers. Thus Esquirol (1828) 5 
pointed out that an idiot was incapable of acquiring the know- 
ledge of a person of his own age under equally favorable external 
conditions. P.M. Duncan and W. Millard (1866) compared the 
“mental gifts” of the “‘feeble-minded”’ with “‘those of children of 
perfect mind at younger ages,” while J. L. Down (1887), in order 
to arrive at a conception of the “mental condition” of the feeble- 
minded child, “‘put back the age” “in imagination” “two or ; 
more years.” But in the case of an idiot “no amount of imagin- 
ary antedated age” corresponds to “‘the present condition of the 
child.” The mental ratings made were, however, largely offhand 
and subjective, representing the personal opinion of the individual 
examiner, although it is likely that the mental status of the child 
was sometimes estimated in terms of the grade standard which 
he had reached in the school. 
The Binet and group intelligence tests. Binet and Simon made 
a unique contribution to the methodology of ascertaining the 
degree of mental deficiency when they constructed an age scale of 
intelligence, which appeared in preliminary form in 1905,! and in 
improved revisions in 1908 and 1911. Numerous revisions and 
extensions of this scale have since appeared in rapid succession in 
many lands, and some form of the scale is now in general use in 
the schools, courts, or institutions in almost every civilized coun- 
try. More recently group tests of intelligence, so-called, have 
appeared in great profusion, and have attained an enormous 
vogue as devices for securing a preliminary rating, or for grouping 
pupils in sections according to test results, or for making a rapid 
survey of the “‘intelligence level” of large groups of individuals. 
1 A brief scale by S. de Sanctis appeared the same year.
-P-A-G-E-379
APPENDIX 357 
Merits of the Binet scale as an instrument for classification. 
These tests will not be discussed in this volume. But a few ad- 
vantages accruing from the use of the Binet-Simon scale, even 
with its admitted imperfections, may be pointed out. 
(1) The tests are objective, are given under controlled and 
standardized conditions, and are supplied with age norms of 
serviceable, if not complete, accuracy. By means of the scale 
intelligence 1 can be measured much as height or weight is, 
although less accurately, of course. The tests help us to replace 
personal impression and opinion with an objective measure. 
(2) Whether absolutely accurate or not, the scale enables us to 
attach a far more definite connotation to the various terms or cate- 
gories in our classification of subnormals than was possible before 
its use. To say that an adolescent is an idiot with a two-year 
mentality or an imbecile with a four-year mentality by the Binet 
scale, is to employ a common, understandable language, because 
the words have a perfectly definite meaning. It is notorious that 
there was formerly little consistency or uniformity in the use of 
different categories in the classification of mental deficients. The 
terms idiot and imbecile were applied by different writers to the 
gravest as well as to the slightest grades of mental defectives. 
The Binet scale has helped to introduce order in our technical 
nomenclature. 
(3) The Binet classification can be used to supplement and 
complete the classifications made from various other points of 
view; in fact all classifications are mutually supplementary and 
complementary. Every classification adds something new to our 
knowledge of an individual. Our knowledge of a macrocephalic 
or a hydrocephalic mental defective is rendered more complete 
if we know that the former is an imbecile with a four-year Binet 
age or an I.Q. of 30, and the other a moron with an eight-year 
Binet age or I.Q. of 50. The Binet rating is particularly valuable 
in connection with the educational and socio-industrial classifi- 
eations which will be briefly discussed below.

Present and potential proficiency. We should attempt to an- 
swer two questions regarding the child’s educational status: (1) 
What is his accomplishment level or stage of advancement in the 
1 Intelligence in the sense of the traits and qualities measured by the tests contained in the 
acale itself, referred to as verbal intelligence by some writers,
-P-A-G-E-380
  358 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
various curricular branches at the time of the examination? 
(2) How much educability, or potential capacity for educational 
advancement, does he possess? To what extent can he be im- 
proved in the various literary branches, in the different forms of 
sensori-motor, industrial arts and vocational training, in physical 
development, in the formation of fixed, desirable and dependable 
habits of thought, feeling, action, social and moral response, appli- 
cation, efficient craftsmanship, and in the appreciation of ethical, 
civic, esthetic and cultural ideals? To what extent can the 
child be trained to care for himself physically, mentally, socially, 
and morally, to support himself and to lead an independent ex- 
istence in society? 
Barr’s classification. This, the best-known educational classi- 
fication — aside from the Vineland, which will be considered in 
the next section — divides subnormals into four groups, with 
rather elaborate subgroupings. The best of the lowest grades 
(“‘idio-imbeciles”’) can only be trained to help themselves and to 
assist others to a limited extent, and require “asylum care” for 
life. The highest grades of the “moral imbeciles” are “trainable 
in manual and intellectual arts,” but have a “genius for evil” and 
require “custodial life and perpetual guardianship.” The high 
grade “imbeciles” possess similar educational possibilities, but 
require “‘long apprenticeship and colony life under protection,” 
while the “‘backward and mentally feeble’”’ are “trainable for a 
place in the world.” 
Value of educational classification. The educational classifica- 
tion, especially the determination of the child’s degree of educa- 
bility, is highly important from the practical viewpoint, for two 
reasons: 
(1) The problem of the improvement or amelioration of nearly 
all the feeble-minded types, and of many backward children, is 
preéminently an educational rather than a medical problem, 
owing to the fact that feeble-mindedness is not an active disease 
process, subject to cure by medication or surgical interference 
(except possibly in a few rare types, such as the cretins, epilep- 
tics, syphilitics, or hydrocephalics, not all of which, however, re- 
spond to medical treatment). It is rather a defect, or a condition 
of arrested, imperfect, or damaged cerebral development which, 
although not eradicable, improves with growth and especially as 
the result of appropriate literary, moral, industrial, and hygienic 
training. The same predication may be made regarding a consid- 
 
-P-A-G-E-381
APPENDIX 359 
erable number of backward children. Indeed at the present 
moment special emphasis in the treatment and prevention of all 
types of mental disorders (psychoses) is being placed on the value 
of reéducation, occupational and social diversion, mental pro- 
phylaxis, the inculcation of right mental attitudes toward the 
problems of life, the establishment of healthy habits of thought, 
feeling, and response, the proper hygiene of the emotions and 
instincts — in a word on “mental hygiene.” 
(2) It is highly important to know whether the child can be 
educated to assume a normal independent position in life, or 
whether he must occupy a subordinate or a dependent position 
and require control, supervision or custody. This knowledge is 
of more vital importance than the knowledge that the child is a 
microcephalic, or macrocephalic, or that the defect is environ- 
mental or hereditary. Information of the latter type is highly 
interesting but of secondary importance for the practical hand- 
ling of mental defectives. 
Limitations of the educational classification. (1) Educability 
depends on many other factors than innate “strength of mind,” 
“inherent capacity,” alertness, or “intelligence”; for example, 
such factors as interest, enthusiasm, ambition, effort, applica- 
tion, early training, age on entering school, regularity of attend- 
ance, the cultural advantages afforded by the habitat, memory 
(school tests used to place a premium on memory rather than on 
judgment or understanding), emotional drive and stability, 
health, and specific physical, mental or educational defects. 
(2) Educability depends not only on the condition or capacity 
of the learner, but also on the skill of the teacher. Some failures 
in school have made normal progress when transferred to another 
teacher. 
(3) The degree of educability, as determined by the school 
standards or the subject matter taught in school, is not always a 
reliable criterion for making predictions regarding the child’s 
ability to succeed in life. 
(4) Children cannot be classified educationally until their 
degree of educability has been determined by actual trial, and 
this takes time. Sometimes a very considerable interval may 
elapse before the teacher is able to reach a positive decision. 
Standardized achievement tests. Recently many standard- 
ized educational tests, or tests of educational attainment, achieve- 
ment, or accomplishment, as they are frequently called, have been  
-P-A-G-E-382
  3860 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
devised, with standard grade scores or norms for practically all of 
the subjects taught in the elementary schools, and for many high 
school and college branches. A few sketchy composite scales of 
instruction have also appeared. But practically all of these 
tests and scales measure the educational level which the child has 
already reached as a result of prior instruction and not the poten- 
tial ability or educability which he may possess in the various 
branches of study, although by repeating the tests at various in- 
tervals a measure may be obtained of the amount of progress 
made, which will furnish an indirect measure of the degree of 
educability. In the absence of any instruction whatever, none of 
the existing educational tests give a measure of the child’s poten- 
tial educational capacities. Such a measure is available to some 
extent in the Binet-Simon scale, performance in which correlates 
fairly closely with degree of educability especially in the literary 
subject-matter, and especially in the case of feeble-minded and 
very backward children. The intelligence examination is, at all 
events, more basic than the educational. 
V. CLASSIFICATION ACCORDING TO Socto-INDUSTRIAL 
ComPETENcy 
This type of classification, which does not differ sharply from 
the preceding, refers (a) to the speed with which the child is able 
to acquire various personal efficiencies, to appropriate and con- 
form to the ordinary social obligations, activities, customs and 
conventions of life, to acquire dexterity in early childhood in the 
performance of the various chores and handicrafts of the home, 
and to acquire skill during adolescence in various trades or occu- 
pations; and (b) to the level of personal, social and occupational 
proficiency actually reached by the subject at the time of the 
examination. 
Where socio-industrial efficiency may be observed. In the 
home can be observed the child’s aptness to gain control over his 
powers and to acquire habits of self-help: to sit, walk, talk, con- 
trol the fundamental reflexes, feed himself with spoon, fork and 
knife, wash himself, dress and undress, button and unbutton, to 
conform to the rules and regulations of the home, to run errands, 
and to perform the ordinary chores and tasks in and about the 
house or farm. Every parent should make and record observa- 
tions on such developmental facts as these, but many neglect this 
important duty. Unfortunately, no very definite developmental
-P-A-G-E-383
  APPENDIX 361 
norms have as yet been established for many of these functions or 
activities. Perhaps most parents tend to estimate the ‘“‘smart- 
ness’’ of their children by the brightness of the facial expression, 
by readiness to understand directions, ability to carry out er- 
rands properly, celerity of performance, quickness of reply, and 
emotional or temperamental make-up. Some parents are notori- 
ously blind to defects in their own children, particularly if they 
are mild-mannered and well-behaved. A mother who brought a 
feeble-minded child from Illinois reported that she never sus- 
pected anything was wrong with him until she received a school 
report after his second year in the first grade. She had noticed 
nothing abnormal in his conduct at home, but a neighbor with 
whom I conferred saw that the child was “not right” at the age 
of three or four. It is surprising how frequently the question, 
“*When did you first discover there was anything wrong with the 
child?” will evoke the reply from the mother: ‘“‘not until he en- 
tered school.” The tendency of some parents to blind them- 
selves to defects in their own progeny may be a “defense reac- 
tion.” 
Again, on the playground children are unconsciously sized up 
by their fellows and peers, and unconsciously classify themselves 
by the way they seize the opportunities afforded to display initi- 
ative, leadership, courage, physical prowess, strength, quickness, 
intelligence, judgment, resourcefulness, honesty, fairness, and 
control of the emotions and disposition. The playground affords 
excellent opportunities for observing children’s ability to codper- 
ate, understand and execute directions, plan, originate, lead, - 
execute, obey, conform to the rules of the game, subordinate indi- 
vidual interests, forget self in the interest of group success, and 
marshall all forces for the attainment of a definite goal in the 
possible face of tremendous odds. One of the great advantages 
of observing the playground activities is the opportunity afforded 
to study the child when he is interested, absorbed, dynamic, 
spontaneously active, that is, as G. Stanley Hall has remarked, 
when he is most truly himself. 
The playground estimates are valuable and often accurate, but 
far from infallible. By no means do all of those who display dom- 
inant personalities on the playground later ascend to positions of 
prominence in the trades or professions. 
Finally, the schools, fields, shops, marts, and offices afford splen- 
did opportunities for observing children’s character traits, special 
 
-P-A-G-E-384
    362 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
interests and talents, habits of industry, vocational ability, abil- 
ity to understand instructions, follow directions, analyze situa- 
tions, and plan solutions, and the power to acquire new motor 
habits and skills. 
Competency standards. Tests and norms of personal, social 
and vocational competency have so far been only imperfectly de- 
veloped. Brief reference was made to speech norms on p. 355. 
An unusual amount of study has been devoted recently to deter- 
mining the optimum personal and environmental, or internal and 
external, conditions for efficient production and skilled workman- 
ship, while the subject of vocational guidance and placement is 
receiving more and more attention. The following are the most 
significant of the various types of studies pursued. 
Types of scientific studies. (1) The study of the relation of 
the “‘level of intelligence” to the degree of skill required in vari- 
ous occupations. Fig. 20 shows the distribution of: the various 
intelligence ratings, based on the Army Alpha Test, obtained by 
various types of workers inthe army. While there is a positive 
correlation between general intelligence, as determined by the 
Binet scale or the Army Alpha group test, and occupational or 
vocational efficiency, the correlation is found to be considerably 
lower than was formerly supposed to be the case. The writer has 
found a very wide range of intelligence quotients and intelligence 
categories in every economic group studied. Based on the teach- 
ers’ estimates of the “degree of competency which . . . the pupils 
will probably show in making their living and taking care of 
themselves after leaving school,” pupils who graded from merely 
backward to imbecile were found in every economic group. 
Pupils with-an I.Q. as low as 36 were reported capable of self- 
support, while others with I.Q.’s up to 84 were reported totally 
dependent. The coefficient of correlation between the intelli- 
gence quotients and the salaries received by thirty-nine special 
school pupils soon after leaving school only amounted to .37. 
M. V. Cobb and R. M. Yerkes likewise found that the economic 
success of physicians did not correlate very closely with intelli- 
gence as based on the Army Alpha scores. 
It is now believed that a child’s industrial efficiency correlates 
more closely with the score obtained in a performance test, such 
as the various form-board, mechanical-ingenuity, and construc- 
tion tests, or S. D. Porteus’s maze tests, than in tests of verbal in- 
telligence, such as the Binet or the Army Alpha.
-P-A-G-E-385

(2) Motion and time studies (Frederick W. Taylor). These 
studies are based on the analysis of the motions made by the 
worker in the execution of different industrial operations, into

-P-A-G-E-386
  364 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
time required for pauses, and the recording of the path or orbit 
and the direction of the movement, to the end that a “standard 
time” for each unit and for the completed operation may be es- 
tablished, that useless, ill-directed and inefficient movements 
may be supplanted by efficient movements (for example, smooth, 
rhythmical, continuous movements), that fatigue may be reduced, 
that working capacity and output may be increased, and that the 
financial returns and contentment of the worker may be enhanced. 
The perfection of the methods of measurement and recording is 
largely due to the work of Frank B. Gilbreth. By means of the 
“chronocyclegraph” the path, length, direction and speed of the 
different movements made by the parts of the body employed in 
an industrial operation can be permanently recorded. The at- 
tachment of a regularly interrupted electrically driven tuning 
fork to the moving limb makes it possible to photograph on a 
moving film the direction and speed of the movement, the light 
spots being pointed on their forward ends. By using a double 
cinematograph and taking the picture stereoscopically (such a 
picture being called a stereocyclegraph), it is possible to exhibit 
continuous movements in three dimensions. Wire models, con- 
structed to show the paths and directions of the motions, are used 
for aiding the learner to analyze the motions. 
Increasing efficiency by eliminating useless movements. Gil- 
breth, as a result of his early time and motion studies, found that 
18 of the 18 customary movements in bricklaying were superflu- 
ous, and that, supplied with standardized conditions, standard- 
ized operations, and adequate training, the output of the average 
bricklayer could be increased from 120 to 860 bricks per hour, 
without any material increase in the amount of physical exertion 
or fatigue. Similarly, the movements required in folding cotton 
were reduced from 20 or 30 to 10 or 12, while the output increased 
from 150 dozen to 400 dozen, without added fatigue. In’an op- 
eration in molding the output was increased 165 per cent, the 
earnings 60 per cent, and the labor cost reduced 54 per cent. In 
making pillow cases, the output was increased 23 per cent and 
the earnings about 140 per cent, and the wage cost reduced about 
50 percent. A part of the increased efficiency is, however, due to 
a better arrangement of the tools and the physical surroundings. 
(8) A considerable number of studies involving the analysis of 
different professions and trades (sometimes referred to as voca- 
tional analysis), of the specialties within the trades (occupational 
analysis), of the particular operation on a particular piece of
-P-A-G-E-387
  APPENDIX 365 
material on a particular machine (job analysis and job specifica- 
tion), and personnel specifications. In addition to describing the 
nature and conditions of the work, the tools, processes and opera- 
tions used, the education, technical knowledge, experience, skill, 
physical strength, and sensory efficiency required by the workers, 
and their duties, remuneration, and terms of promotion, attempts 
have been made to draw up a list of psychological qualifications 
or traits needed in different occupations as determined either by 
the judgment of expert workers or by psychological tests of suc- 
cessful and unsuccessful employees. Little attempt has been 
made to scientifically analyze different occupations in terms of 
the work itself rather than in terms of extraneous tests. Espe- 
cially significant are the “‘trade specifications” worked up by the 
Division of Personnel in the Army for 714 civilian trades and 
occupations, indicating the duties attached to each occupation, 
the qualifications needed by the candidate for appointment, and 
the types of occupational experience or training which may be 
substituted. The duties and qualifications of a “forging ma- 
chine operator” are given as follows: 
Foraine Macutne Operator

ing machines, such as bulldozes and hydraulic presses on general

chines, screw, toggle and hydraulic presses for heading staybolts,

-P-A-G-E-388
  3866 EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 
(4) Tests of proficiency or acquired skill, to determine whether 
applicants for appointment already possess trained skill for dif- 
ferent jobs or occupations and, if so, the degree of skill possessed. 
The “army trade tests,” constructed and standardized for 83 of 
the more essential trades before mobilization ceased, were of a 
threefold nature: 
(a) Verbal, based on oral or written answers to oral or written questions 
regarding technical details of the trade in question. 
(b) Pictorial, based on oral answers to oral questions concerning a given 
trade situation depicted in pictures, the naming of the tools, machines or 
parts of machinery shown, and designation of their uses. This form of test 
was devised to overcome language difficulties or to serve as a check on 
coaching. 
(c) Performance, based on the actual execution of a typical job, requiring 
the use of the principal tools, from a blue print or printed directions. 
On the basis of the results of these tests — the first or the sec- 
ond of which, curiously, proved far more valuable per unit of 
examination time than the actual performance test except in 
trades which were almost wholly matters of skill, such as steno- 
graphy and automobile driving — the workman was graded as 
a novice, apprentice, journeyman, or expert. New tests of this 
type are constantly in the making. Thus, to measure general 
mechanical ability in school children J. L. Stenquist has devised a 
set of picture tests of “mechanical aptitude” in which the pupils 
pass judgments regarding the nature and functions of common 
mechanical devices or their parts, and a set of “‘assembling tests” 
in which the pupil must put together parts of common objects, 
such as locks, traps, or bells. 
(5) Tests of trade capacity, potentiality or prediction, for as- 
certaining whether or not the individual possesses the physical 
and mental powers and capacities necessary for acquiring skill or 
achieving success in various occupations. Attempts have been 
made to determine the individual’s “mental type,” and the 
mental type needed for success in different occupations; to dis- 
cover the trait, or combination of traits, which may be respon- 
sible for the success or failure of successful or unsuccessful per- 
sons (“‘trait analysis”); to classify jobs according to the predom- 
inant human qualifications needed for success in them; to con- 
struct and standardize objective psychological, psychophysical, 
medical and other tests which measure the amount which an in- 
dividual may possess of the complex of underlying component
-P-A-G-E-389
  APPENDIX 367 
traits or capacities needed for acquiring proficiency in any par- 
ticular job; and to express an individual’s fitness for a particular 
job by means of a composite score, giving due consideration to 
the factors of intelligence, education, specialized training, special 
talents, physical capacity, etc. A beginning has been made in the 
construction of tests or composite scales for prospective typists, 
motormen (Miinsterberg), telegraphers (L. L. Thurstone), cler- 
ical workers (E. A. Thorndike, W. D. Scott, H. C. Link, Thur- 
stone, A. S. Otis), secretaries (A. T. Poffenberger), salesclerks 
(Elsie O. Brigman), salesmen (W. W. Charters), stenographers 
~ and comptometers (M. A. Bills, H. C. Link), musicians (C. E. 
Seashore), aviators (V. A. C. Henmon), bicycle-ball inspectors 
(S. E. Thompson), assemblers of gun parts (Link), ete. 
(6) The industrial classification of the feeble-minded grouped 
according to Binet-Simon age. The Vineland classification, indi- 
cating the representative tasks which typical feeble-minded chil- 
dren under twenty in each Binet age were able to do in the Train- 
ing School at Vineland according to the reports submitted by the 
attendants, teachers, and employees, is as follows, exclusive of 
Binet ages ten to twelve (which are based on few observations and 
ona level of ability which, in our judgment, is not predicative 
of feeble-mindedness) :

The writer made a similar, but more elaborate, study of epilep- 
tics of a wider range of ages in 1910-1911. The original data, 
which have never been compiled, are in the files of the New Jer- 
sey State Village for Epileptics. 
No similar ratings have been made of mentally defective adults, 
either institutional or extra-institutional, but numerous recorded 
observations have revealed individuals at large who are not only 
law-abiding but supporting themselves and families as well, and 
yet who have intelligence levels by the Binet scale of only ten 
years, or even less. 
(7) The study of the relation of emotional, temperamental, 
and instinctive traits, volitional disorders, character peculiarities, 
and psychotic tendencies to social, industrial, and economic suc- 
cess. In S. D. Porteus’s social rating scale a numerical index of 
social sufficiency is derived from the weighted ratings given the 
feeble-minded subjects in certain defects of the personality, 
the defects most indicative of social maladaptability being lack 
of planning capacity, suggestibility, irresolution, impulsiveness, 
excitability, obstructiveness, and moodiness. Individuals with 
an index below 22 can get along in the community, while those 
from 36 to 44 require permanent custodial care and are not very 
trainable. Pugnacity, bad temper, disobedience, cunning, sly- 
ness and disrespect for authority had “‘no relation to estimated 
social sufficiency.”” The brightest children among the mental 
defectives were the most disobedient and troublesome. 
Value of this classification. This type of classification is fun- 
damental from the viewpoint of recommendations regarding the 
kind of training to be provided and the ultimate disposition to be 
made of the case. Ultimately we must face the question whether 
the child has sufficient capacity or acquired competency, general 
or special, to earn his living in some useful pursuit, and whether 
he can also exercise sufficient self-control to manage his own af- 
fairs with reasonable discretion, to assume an independent posi- 
tion in society, to assume social obligations, and to conform to 
the laws and conventions of society; or whether he is so defective 
intellectually, emotionally, volitionally and morally, and incom- 
petent industrially, that he will always remain dependent and 
more or. less irresponsible and possibly potentially or actually 
delinquent. We cannot wisely plan the child’s course of training 
without attempting some sort of answer to these questions. The 
larger problem in the case of the feeble-minded is social — the 
 
-P-A-G-E-391
    APPENDIX 369 
proper protection of society from the consequences of mental 
defect, the protection of the helpless and dependent from want 
and the irresponsible from the consequences of their folly or evil 
propensities, and the salvaging of all the assets possessed by 
defectives for productive, constructive work under custody, 
supervision, parole, or the liberties of citizenship. The basic 
criteria in the diagnosis of feeble-mindedness, on which the legal 
definition is framed, are psychological and sociological, as pointed 
out in Chapter III.

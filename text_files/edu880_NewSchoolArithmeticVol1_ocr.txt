Nel PREFACE 
This book is planned to cover the work of the first five years 
in the elementary school. It is not believed either necessary or 
desirable that a book on numbers should be placed in the hands 
of a pupil before he completes the second grade. However, 
matter that is helpful to the teacher in preparing oral and written 
work for the students in the first and second grades is found in 
the first pages of the book. This material should be reviewed when 
the book is placed in the hands of the’ pupil at the beginning of 
the third year. . 
The authors believe that accuracy and rapidity in performing 
the fundamental operations should be acquired in the early years 
of a child’s school life. Hence, an abundance of material for prac- 
tice and drill is provided. But the acquisition of skill in handling 
numbers is of little value within itself unless the power of apply- 
ing the skill to the solution of problems is gained. Consequently, 
there are a large number of problems appealing to the child’s va- 
rious experiences. 
The fundamental operations are several times repeated with 
gradually increasing difficulty. A child’s skill in using numbers 
is not acquired by first coming into contact with numbers to be 
added, then subtracted, then multiplied, and then divided; but 
he gains his experience of them gradually without any particular 
order of occurrence. Nor does a child gain his knowledge of 
whole numbers and then acquire a knowledge of fractions. From 
the time he cries when a piece of his cake is given to his brother, 
he has an appreciation for the difference between the whole and

apart. Therefore, the subject of fractions is introduced early 
in the book and the fundamental operations are frequently re- 
peated, . 
There are many helpful ways in stimulating interest in num- 
ber work, a few of which are suggested for the inexperienced or 
untrained teacher, Due to a lack of space, no text-book can 
illustrate many of the devices that may be used. Experienced 
or trained teachers will naturally, prefer to use the methods they 
have successfully put to test, and the arrangement of the subject 
matter lends itself to the use of any valid method of presenting 
the subject. - . . R.L. J.

2 apples taken from 4 apples leaves 2 apples. 
Finding the difference between two numbers is 
subtraction. 
4 apples — 2 apples = 2 apples. 
The sign of subtraction (—) is read minus or less, 
and is placed before the number that is to be sub- 
tracted or taken from another number. Thus, 4 
apples — 2 apples = 2 apples, is read: 
4 apples minus 2 apples equals 2 apples, or 
4 apples less 2 apples equals 2 apples.

Nore To TeacHEr: Pupils should practice on tables till they 
can make ali combinations at sight. Accuracy and rapidity in 
. handling all simple combinations of numbers should be acquired 
in the early years of a pupil’s life. Have frequent drills. The 
slow calculator is likely to be inaccurate.

You cannot subtract 4 units from 2 units. Take 1 
ten from the 4 tens and add it to the 2 units. 1 ten 
=10units. 10 units + 2 units = 12 units. 12 units— 
4 units=8 units. Write 8 in units’ place. Since 1 ten has been taken from the 4 tens, there are left only 3 tens 
inthe minuend. 3 tens—3 tens = 0. Place 0 in tens’ 
place. 5 hundreds — 2 hundreds = 3 hundreds. Write 3 in hundreds’ place. 
Test: Add the subtrahend to the remainder. If 
the sum equals the minuend, the answer is correct. 56.

THAN THREE FIGURES 
The largest number you have written and read in 
writing exercises and in solving problems is 999. If 
you had 999 dollars and your father gave you $1 more, 
you would then have One Thousand Dollars, which is 
written in figures thus: $1000. 
How many figures does it take to write one thousand? 
The figure on the right is in units’ place. 
The second figure is in tens’ place. 
The third figure is in hundreds’ place. 
The fourth figure is in thousands’ place.

Numbers are written and read in groups or periods 
of three figures. The first group or period of three, 
units, tens, hundreds, is called units’ period. The 
second group of three, thousands, ten thousands, hun-

When dollars and cents are written together, a 
decimal point, (.), is placed after the figure or figures 
indicating the number of dollars. The, cents occupy 
the first two places at the right of the decimal point. 
Mills occupy the first place to the right of cents. 
In reading dollars, the decimal point, which separates 
dollars and cents, is read and. Thus, $4.75 is read: 
“four dollars and seventy-five cents.” —_ $2.978 is read: 
“two dollars and ninety-seven cents eight mills.”

When multiplier is a larger number than can be 
expressed with two figures. 
344 124 =100+-20+4

In multiplying by 2 tens (or 20) and by 1 hundred 
the 0’s may be omitted as shown on the left. The first 
figure of the partial product is always written under 
that figure in the multiplier that produced it. 
3896 Multiplicand The numbers obtained 
248 Multiplier in multiplying the mul- 
  tiplicand by each fig-

4. 2387 In the multiplier 204, there are 0 
204 tens. If each figure in the multipli- 
9518 cand be multiplied by 0, the product 
ATTA in each case is 0. 
486.948 0X7 units =0. 
948 0X8 tens =0. 
0X3 hundreds =0, ©

FACTORS . 157 
188. FACTORS 
You have learned that when two or more numbers 
are multiplied together the result obtained is a product. 
The numbers which are multiplied together to pro- 
duce a product are called factors. 
Any product is exactly divisible by any of its factors. 
Find the missing factor: 
--X7=42, _.X9=54, _.X T= 49, --x6=36. 
--X9=63, -.X8=56, __X 7= 28, -.xX8=72. 
--X6=24, __X7=84, __xX 9= 81, --X7=63. 
--X7=56, _.X4=36, _.x12=144, -_.X7=77. 
The process of separating a number into its factors 
is called factoring. 
Separate at sight each of the following numbers into 
two factors: 
1. 8, 10, 16, 20, 21, 24, 18, 22, 28, 32, 64, 121. 
2. 36, 35, 40, 50, 48, 44, 42, 54, 56, 60, 66, 70. 
3. 72, 77, 84, 80, 81, 90, 88, 96, 100, 110, 132, 144. 
Some numbers may be separated into two or more 
sets of factors. Thus, 36 is composed of 218,312, 
4x9, or 6X6. 
Name at sight all the sets of two factors that make: 
L. 12, 24, 16, 20, 40, 50, 80, 72, 18, 30, 42. 
2. Name five numbers that have only one set of 
two factors.

161 It is sometimes difficult to tell 
74 without making a trial division 
69 just what the quotient figure 
Fe will be. As 2 is contained in 
46 16, 8 times, it might appear that 
pT ind 23 is contained in 168, & times. 
remainder On trial we find 238 =184. As 
the product 184 is larger than 
the partial dividend 168, we know the quotient figure 
is too large. 
If it appears that 23 is contained in 168, 6 times, we 
find by multiplying divisor 23x6=188. 168—138= 
30. Since the remainder 30 is larger than the divisor, 
we know the quotient 6 is too small. 
Remember: If the product of the divisor by the 
quotient figure is larger than the partial dividend, the 
quotient figure is too large. .

204 ROMAN. NOTATION 
CHAPTER V. 
170. Roman Notation 
Notation is the art of writing numbers. 
Numeration is the art of reading numbers. 
The numbers you have learned to read and write 
were represented by the figures: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 
9, 0. This system of writing numbers is called the 
Arabic system, because the Arabs are supposed to 
have introduced it into Europe. 
All numbers in the Roman notation are represented 
by the following letters: 
I= 1 L= 50 
V= 5 C=100 
X=10 D =500 
M =1,000 
Repeating a letter repeats its value, thus: 
I= 1 C= 100 
Il= 2 CC= 200 
X=10 M = 1000 
XX =20 MM =2000 
When a letter of less value is placed before one of 
greater value, the less is subtracted from the greatef. 
IV=4 IX=9 XC =90 
When a letter of less value is placed after one of 
greater value, the less is added to the greater. 
VI=6 XI=11 CX =110 
11 =10+1 is written XI. 
12 =10+2 is written XII. 
13 =10+ is written XIII.
-P-A-G-E-211
ROMAN NOTATION 205 
14=10+4 is written XIV. 
15=10+5 is written XV. 
16=10-+6 is written XVI. 
17 =10+7 is written XVII. 
18=10+8 is written XVIII. 
19 =10+-9 is written XIX. 
20 =104+10 is written XX. 
21 =20+1 is written XXI. 
30=XXX. 40=XL. 
50=L. 60 =LX. 
70=LXX. 80 =LXXX. 
90 =XC. 99 =XCIX. 
All the numbers between any even number of 10's, 
as 20 and 30, etc., are formed by adding to the tens 
the Roman numerals representing the numbers ex- 
pressed by the Arabic figures, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 
40=XL  50=L 60 =LX 90=XC 
49=XLIX 55=LV 62=LXII 96=XCVI 
Write in Roman numerals the following: 72, 74, 76, 
78, 93, 97, 99, 98, 37, 47, 49, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 
800, 700, 1000, 1500, 1600, 2000. , 
Read the following: XIX, XXXIV, CC, DC, DCC, 
M, MD, MDC, MM, M, DCD, MDCDXIV. 
Write your age in Roman numerals. 
Write the date of the breaking out of the great 
World War in Roman numerals. 
Write in Roman numerals the following dates: 1492, 
1776, 1812, 1845, 1918.

eace only to the numbers represented by that period. Illustra- 
tion: Four million forty thousand forty is written 4 comma 040

175. DIVISION 
REVIEW— DIVISION 
1. Divide 934605 by 567. 
SuccEstion: In cases of division where 
1648334 the divisor is a large number, first consider 
567)934605 as a whole the divisor and the partial divi- 
567 dend that will contain it. For instance, 
3676. 567 is contained in the partial dividend, 934, 
6 how many times? Compare 500 and 900. 
3402, Is 900 less than 2500? If so, the quotient 
2740 figure is less than 2. Why? In obtaining 
2268 the second quotient figure, it might appear 
"4725 that 567 is contained in 3676 seven times, 
because 500 is contained in 3600 seven times. 
4536 But the divisor 567 is more nearly 600 than 
189. 500 and we find the second quotient figure 
to be 6.

The word decimal comes from a Latin word meaning 
ten. 
In whole numbers or decimals, 10 units of one place 
equal one unit of the next place to the left. 
10 units =1 ten 
10 tens =1 hundred 
10 hundreds =1 thousand 
-010 (10 thousandths) =.01 (1 hundredth) 
-10 (10 hundredths) =.1 (1 tenth) 
1.0 (10 tenths) =1. (1 unit) 
5. A whole number and a decimal written together, 
as 5.5, is called a mixed decimal, and is read: Five and 
five tenths. 535, = 5.5. Write as mixed decimals: 
Tz, 25345, 4785, 49648, 562y% 57, 32535). 
The decimal point (.) is used to separate the units 
and the parts of units. It is always placed at the 
right of units and before tenths.

Five thousand six hundred eight ten-thousandths, be- 
cause the 8 stands in ten-thousandths’ place. 
7. In writing decimals, every place from the lowest

To divide any number by a decimal: 
Divide: 3+ 3=1 
3+.3=1 
Note: The quotient in each of these problems is the same. 
Multiplying the divisor and dividend by the same number does 
not change the quotient. 
Divide 1.735 by .05. 
1.735 + .05 =173.5 +5 =34.7. 
Divide .35 by .07. 
35 +.07 =35 +7 =5. 
When the divisor contains a decimal: multiply the 
divisor and dividend by 10, 100, or 1000, etc., to make 
the divisor a whole number and proceed as in the di- 
vision of a decimal by a whole number. 
Moving the decimal point to the right the same 
number of places in both divisor and dividend is 2 
short way to multiply by 10, 100, 1000, etc.

230 DENOMINATE NUMBERS 
189. DENOMINATE NUMBERS 
A concrete number applied to measurements es- 
tablished by law or custom, as $5, 4 bushels, 3 yards, 
1 hour, is called a Denominate Number. 
A Denominate Number consisting of a single denom- 
ination, as 4 bushels, is called a Simple Denominate 
Number. 
A Denominate Number consisting of more than one 
denomination, as 4 bushels 3 pecks, is called a Com- 
pound Denominate Number. 
For what is dry measure used? 
Repeat the table of dry measure. 
Change 8 bushels to pecks. 
1 bushel =4 pecks. 
8 bushel =8X4 pecks =32 pecks. 
Changing a denominate number from one denomina- 
tion to another without changing its value is called 
reduction. 
Reducing a denominate number from a higher to a 
lower denomination is called reduction descending, as 
in the case of reducing bushels to pecks. 
Reducing a denominate number from a lower to a 
higher denomination is called reduction ascending, as 
in the case of reducing pecks to bushels. 
Change 64 quarts to bushels. 
8 qt. =1 pk. 4 pk. =1 bu.

234 SQUARE MEASURE 
192. SQUARE MEASURE 
Square measure is used for measuring surfaces, as a 
floor, blackboard, land, ete. 
A surface has two dimensions, length and breadth. 
The greater dimension of a surface is called its 
length, the less dimension its breadth. 
The unit of measure for surfaces is a square inch 
(sq. in.), a square foot, or a square yard, etc., ac- 
cording to the size of the surface measured. 
A square inch is a square 1 in. long and 1 in. wide. 
A square foot is a square 1 ft. long and 1 ft. wide.

The figure ABCD is a rectangle. A rectangle is a 
4-sided figure that has its opposite sides equal and 
parallel and its angles all equal. 
The rectangle ABCD is 4 ft. long and 3 ft. wide. 
What is its area in sq. ft.? As you want to know the 
area in square feet, take 1sq. ft. for the 
unit of measure and see how many times you can lay 
it off on one row 1 ft. wide. You will find you can Jay 
it down exactly 4 times on a surface 1 ft. wide and 4 
ft. long, and the measuring unit can be placed on the 
width of the rectangle three times, thus making 3 rows.
-P-A-G-E-243
APPLICATIONS OF SQUARE MEASURE 2387 
Since there are 4 sq. ft. in one row, in 3 rows there are 
3X4 sq. ft. = 12 sq. ft. in the whole rectangle. The 
number of times a surface contains its unit of measure 
is called its area. 
You may find the area ofa rectangle by multiplying 
the number of square units contained in one dimension 
by the number of rows of such square units contained 
in the other dimension. 
Nore: The same result is obtained by multiplying the length 
by the breadth after expressing both dimensions i in the same de- 
Nomination.

How many years have passed since 1000 B. C.? Since 
1000 A. D.? 
The first century began with 1 A. D. and closed with 
100 A. D. 
The year 1800 A. D. closed the ____ century. 
The year 1801 A. D. was the beginning of the 19th

mal limited to two places or hundredths. 
211. PERCENTAGE 
There is another way of expressing decimal hun- 
dredths which means exactly the same. Instead of 
writing six hundredths thus .06, we may use this sign, 
%, and write it 6%. We read it in the latter form six 
per cent.

266 PERCENTAGE 
We have already learned that hundredths may be 
expressed as per cents and that the sign % may be 
used instead of the words per cent. 
The number of per cent taken, as 5%, 6%, etc., is 
called the rate. 
The number of which the rate is taken is called the 
base. 
The number obtained by finding the per cent of the 
base is called the percentage.

Acircle is a plane figure 
bounded by a curved line, 
every point of which is G H 
equally #Histant from a 
point within called the 
center. D 
The curved line bounding the circle is called the 
circumference. 
A straight line passing through the center of the 
circle and ending in the circumference is called the 
diameter. ce 
The line GH is a diameter of the circle. 
A line drawn from the center of a circle to the cir- 
cumference is called the radius. The line CD is a 
radius. 
The radius is 4 of the diameter. 
_Take a dollar or any other coin and measure its 
circumference and diameter. 
_ Take a stove pipe, oyster can, log, or any object that 
is round, measure the distance around it, or the cit- 
cumference, and measure the distance through the

The wisdom with which one spends his money de- 
termines whether he will become independent or wheth- 
er he will be a burden on some one else when old age 
comes upon him and his earning days are over. If one 
saves a part of what he earns and invests it wisely, he 
will be able to provide for his future needs. If he 
spends more than he earns, he will soon lose the confi- 
dence of the people and will be unable to get credit. 
If he spends all that he earns, he will always be in a 
financial strait. Most fortunes have: been made by 
small earnings wisely invested. Most paupers have 
been made by unwise spending of all earnings.

232. ADDITION OF DENOMINATE NUMBERS. 
Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division 
are called the fundamental operations because all 
problems are solved by the use of one or more of these 
processes. . 
If in compound denominate numbers, ten units of 
one order uniformly made one of the next higher, the 
fundamental operations would be performed exactly 
as in simple numbers.

CHAPTER I. 
STATISTICS OF NORMAL SCHOOLS, 1917-18. 
Prepared under the Supervision of H. R. Bonner, Specialist in Educational Statistics. 
CONTENTS.—Types of schools represented—Number of schools reporting—Length of sessions—Number 
of instructors—Number of students enrolled—Graduates from normal courses—Practice teaching 
and facilities for it—Libraries—Property—Income—Expenditures—Accuracy—Summer sessions in 
1917—Changes in the normal-school list—General summary. 
TYPES OF SCHOOLS REPRESENTED. 
This report includes data on public and private normal schools. 
It does not include data on the State teachers’ colleges of Colorado, 
fowa, and New York. ‘These institutions are included under sta- 
tistics of universities, colleges, and professional schools in another 
chapter of the Biennial Survey. 
The normal schools have been classified chiefly on the basis of 
control. Those under State control are State normal schools. The 
State normal schools of Pennsylvania were, prior to 1911, only 
partly under State control. They were owned by corporations. 
Of the 18 trustees for each institution, 6 were appointed by the 
superintendent of public instruction. The code of 1911 provided 
for the purchase of the institutions by the State.? Six of them 
have become the property of the State under this act. 
A city normal school is one under the control of the city board of 
education. 
The definition of a county normal school varies somewhat in the 
different States.? Wisconsin has the only true county normal 
schools. They are separate from the regular public schools in 
control, school plant, and all other respects. In Michigan the 
county training classes have their own boards. In Ohio the county 
normal schools are operated in connection with first-grade high 
schools. They are under, the supervision of the county superin- 
tendent, and he nominates the director of the school. _The county 
normal schools of Wisconsin and Ohio are included here, as are 
also several from Michigan. Eighteen other States make provision 
for the training of teachers in a number of secondary schools. 
Private schools are under private control. On this basis several 
schools formerly included under public normal schools have been 
included with the private schools for the purposes of this study.

NUMBER OF SCHOOLS REPORTING. 
The number of normal schools reporting since 1900 is shown in 
Tables 1-5 and in figure 1. One fact to be noted is the steady

increase in the number of State normal schools. This is the case 
despite the fact that several States have abandoned their State nor- 
mal schools as separate institutions and that a number of State
-P-A-G-E-21
  
STATISTICS OF NORMAL SCHOOLS, 1917-1918, 21 
normal schools have become State teachers’ colleges, and conse- 
quently are now reported under ‘‘Universities, Colleges, and Profes- 
sional Schools.” The institutions located at the following places 
were transferred to the latter list at the respective dates: Cedar Falls, 
Towa, 1911; Greeley, Colo., 1912; Albany, N. Y., 1913. 
In several States normal schools are organized as part of a State 
college or university. The statistics of such State normal schools 
are included in the data of these higher institutions since they have 
become so organized. The following States, with the respective 
numbers of institutions, are cases in point: Florida 1, Nevada 1, 
Ohio 2, Utah 1, Wyoming 1. The two universities in Ohio which do 
this work were included in the data cited herein for the years 1908, 
1910, and 1912. 
The State Normal and Industrial College for Colored Persons at 
Tallahassee, Fla., was included in the reports on normal schools 
until 1911 and at the same time under the ‘‘Agricultural and 
Mechanical Colleges.”” A similar statement applies to the Georgia 
State Industrial College for Colored Persons, Savannah, Ga., until 
1907. 
There has also been an increase in the number of city normal 
schools. In 1918 there were 26 per cent more reports than in 1900. 
The corresponding increase in the number of State normal schools is 
35 per cent. 
Nearly all of the county normal schools have been established since 
1900. Those in Wisconsin were established under a law enacted in 
‘1899. ‘Twenty-five reported from Wisconsin in 1918. Those of Ohio 
are of more recent date and reported for the first time in 1918. 
Twenty-one of the latter are included in the data of Tables 1-5 and 
in figure 1.- 
Another observation to be made is the decrease in the number of 
private normal schools. Table 5 shows this decrease to have occurred 
in most of the States having such schools. The increase in 1918 is 
partly due to including 25 kindergarten training schools in 1918, 
while in 1916 only 14 reported. The decrease in private normal 
schools is probably largely accounted for by two causes, first, increased 
cost of conducting schools; and, second, the increased public pro- 
vision for higher education and for this type of training. 
The 57 private normal schools reporting in 1918 are classified as 
follows: 
Kindergarten training schools. . -.- 
General normal schools and colleges. 
Normal schools of physical education. . 
Industrial and technical normal schools    
        Bw AMO 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
22 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
The data for 1918 include 24 normal schools for colored persons 
distributed as follows (see Tables 32-39): 
State normal schools 
City normal schools 
Private normal schools. . . 
From Table 5 one may gain a fair knowledge of the change in the 
number of the various kinds of normal schools in the different States. 
Of course a number of schools fail to make reports at times, but, in 
general, the data given indicate the increase or the decrease.

The length of time which the normal schools were in session during 
the year 1917-18 is shown in Table 6. For State normal schools the 
most common number of weeks is 42. This usually includes a sum- 
mer session of 6 weeks. The most common length of session for city 
normal schools is 40 weeks, for county normal schools 40 weeks, and 
for private normal schools 36 weeks. 
NUMBER OF INSTRUCTORS.   The number of instructors in normal schools since 1900 has steadily 
increased, as is shown in Table 1. This increase, as is quite evident 
from figure 2, has been in public normal schools. In 1918 there 
were more than twice as many instructors reported in State normal 
schools as in 1900. In the same time the number in city and county 
normal schools increased approximately 78 per cent, while the num- 
ber in private normal schools decreased approximately 41 per cent. 
From figure 3 it is observed that the average size of faculty in 
State normal schools has increased regularly and rapidly. This indi- 
cates that those institutions are becoming larger and are doing more

work. The data seem to indicate that the faculties of city and 
county normal schools are becoming smaller. This is due largely to 
the increase in the number of county normal schools, most of which 
have small faculties, as will be noted later. 
The average size of faculty in private normal schools is increasing.

these institutions is decreasing, it is obvious that the smaller schools 
are going out of existence, while the larger ones are surviving. The 
decrease in the size of faculty in 1918 is partly due to including more 
kindergarten training schools, which generally have small faculties. 
With those eliminated in 1918 which were not included in 1916 (13 
schools, with a total of 96 instructors) the average size of faculty in 
private normal schools was 20.3 in 1918.

  26 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-18, 
The number of instructors in normal courses in State normal 
schools shows an increase since 1900 (see fig. 4). So does also the 
number in city and county normal schools, except from 1916 to 1918. 
The number in private normal schools shows a general rapid decrease.

  Fia. 5.—Average number ofinstructors per school in normal courses, 1900-1918. 
Figure 5 is of interest as showing the relative average number of 
instructors per school in normal courses in the different kinds of 
institutions. The average is highest in the State schools and lowest 
in private schools. With the 13 kindergarten training schools, as

above mentioned, eliminated in 1918, the average number in private 
schools for that year is 9.8. The decrease in the city and county 
schools since 1910 is probably due to the increase in the number of 
county normal schools, which have small faculties. 
The total number of instructors and the number in normal courses 
are compared in figure 6.1. There is not much regular change in the

creased, thus indicating that those which survived tend to devote 
more energy to instruction in other than normal courses. 
  
In these ratios for 1918 only those schools are used which reported both sets of data.

The size of faculty in the various normal schools in 1918 may be 
noted from Table 7. The county schools generally have the smallest 
faculties, and the State schools the largest. The typical size of the 
State normal school faculty is from 21 to 40.   TaBLe 8.—Distribution of normal schools according to the number of instructors engaged

Table 8 is similar to Table 7 in its make-up. The summer school 
faculty is included in the total for the year, which tends to increase 
the size of the faculty represented in this table over the average 
number in the faculty during the regular year (for the size of summer 
school faculty see Table 30). 
NUMBER OF STUDENTS ENROLLED. 
Since 1912 there has been an increase in the total enrollment (see 
Table 1, item 3 a). Figure 7 shows that the increase was largely in 
State normal schools. The total enrollment in private normal schools 
shows a decided falling off.

A more reliable set of data than the total enrollment for the period 
1900-1918 is the enrollment in normal courses (see fig. 8). The curves 
of figure 8 are fairly regular. Again, it may be observed that the 
number in State normal schools increased rapidly, the number in

city and county normal schools almost as rapidly, while those in pri-

their relative importance has been rapidly increasing.

A number of comparisons are made in Table 9 between the number 
of schools, the number of instructors, and the number of students 
enrolled. Marked changes occur with regularity in only a few cases. 
Item 5 of this table seems to indicate that from 1906 to 1916 private 
normal schools devoted an increasing amount of attention to training 
teachers. This tendency seems different from that noted above in 
figures 3, 5, and 6.

The status of enrollment in 1918 is shown in Tables 10, 11, 12, 32, 
36, and 38. The total enrollment for the year includes the enrollment 
in the summer session of 1917. This means that some schools, 
especially those with large summer schools, are likely to have a much 
larger total enrollment than they would have had if the data only for 
the regular year, not including the summer, had been used. Similar 
remarks apply to the data of Tables 11 and 12.

A better means of comparing the amount of service which the 
schools render is the number of attendance weeks. Table 13 gives 
these for resident students in normal courses. For a number of 
schools not reporting this item the enrollment: weeks were 
computed and the results included in Table 13. The number 
thus computed is somewhat higher than the actual number of enroll- 
ment weeks, the difference being greater in the cases of the longer 
terms. This number is also higher than the number of attendance 
weeks, but it is nevertheless a rough approximate means of compari- 
son and is more nearly correct than the enrollment.

GRADUATES FROM NORMAL COURSES. 
Table 1 shows that the number of graduates from normal courses 
in normal schools increased with fair regularity from 1902 to 1916. 
Figure 9 indicates that this increase has been in public normal 
schoois and chiefly in the State institutions. It also shows the 
relative importance of the three types of institutions in the training 
of teachers as measured by the number of graduates from normal 
courses.

Whether the number of graduates is keeping pace with the demand 
can not be ascertained since the number of new teachers entering 
the profession annually is not known. 
To determine the relative numbers of men and women who gradu- 
ated from normal courses in normal schools, index numbers were 
computed (see fig. 10). The index numbers of the number of men 
graduates were found by dividing the number for each year con- 
sidered (see Table 1) by the average number for the years 1900-1918. S.

  Fia. 9.—Number of graduates from normal courses in normal schools, 1900-1918. 
In the same way the index numbers were computed for the number 
of women graduates. 
The relative increase or decrease in the number of graduates is 
shown by the steepness of the slope of the curves between the dates 
considered. Thus, for example, from 1906 to 1908 both curves 
have practically the same slope, thus indicating that the increase in 
the number of men graduates and in the number of women graduates 
was relatively about the same. From 1908 to 1910 the number of 
women graduates increased relatively much more than did the num- 
ber of men graduates. In general the number of women increased
-P-A-G-E-35
STATISTICS OF NORMAL SCHOOLS, 1917-1918. 35 
more rapidly relatively than did the number of men. The number 
of men decreased rapidly from 1900 to 1906, then increased until 
1916. The falling off from 1916 to 1918 was likely due to the war.

PRACTICE TEACHING AND FACILITIES FOR IT. 
The amount of practice teaching and the facilities for it are impor- 
tant items in normal schools. 
From Table 15 it is clear that there is considerable variation in 
the importance attached to it. Thirty-one schools require fewer 
than 50 hours per student completing the normal course, while in 
7 schools each student received at least 800 hours. Much emphasis 
is placed on practice teaching in a relatively large- proportion of 
city normal schools. The large numbers of hours in private schools 
generally occur in kindergarten training schools. In State normal 
schools the variation is not so marked. The county schools give 
less attention to it than do the others. It is to be noted, however, 
that the normal courses in the county schools of Ohio and Michigan 
are only one year in length.

ariation, as is shown in Table 16. As is to be expected the city 
ormal schools have large model -and practice school enrollments, 
ue to the fact that the whole city system is available for it. County 
ormal schools generally have small model and practice schools. 
LIBRARIES. 
The number of volumes in libraries of normal schools rapidly 
creased from 1900 to 1918 (see Table 1). In Tables 2-4 this 
merease is seen to have occurred chiefly in the State normal schools. 
© number in city and county schools also increased, but the num- 
er in private schools decreased. 
The average size of libraries in the State schools was more than 
oubled from 1900 to 1918 (ee fig. 11). That of private schools 
lalso increased.

The data on the number of volumes in the libraries of normal 
schools for 1918 are exhibited in Table 17. This makes clear the 
great variation in the size of libraries. A number of the State institu- 
tions are very well provided, 32 having more than 16, 000 vol mes 
each. A number of them, however, are inadequately provided. 
The libraries of county normal schools are generally small. 
VALUE OF PROPERTY. 
The total property valuation of normal schools may be noted in 
Tables 33, 36, and 39. The variation in this item is shown in Table 18. 
From this it appears that a number of the institutions are well-to-do in 
this respect. The valuation of more than half of the schools falls 
between $200,000 and $550,000.

INCOME OF NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The receipts of normal schools have increased very rapidly since 
1900. (See Tables 1-4 and fig. 12.) The data show that this increase 
has occurred very largely in the State schools. 
From figure 13 it is evident that the State normal schools in more 
recent years are securing a smaller percentage of their income from 
public appropriations than was the case from 1900 to 1908. This 
means that more is being received from such sources as fees, gifts, 
productive funds, etc.

1 Expenditures. 
The average income of normal schools shows a rapid increase in 
the State and in the private schools. (See fig. 14.) The drop in 
the curve for private schools in 1912 was due partly to the fact 
that several large schools were included in 1910 but not in 1912. 
The decrease shown in the city and county schools occurred largely 
because fewer large schools and more small schools reported their 
income in later years. 
The derivation of the income of State normal schools in 1917-18 
is set forth in figure 15. These percentages were obtained by com- 
paring the total receipts, less the income from public funds for  
-P-A-G-E-40

increase of plant, with the amount received from public funds for 
current expensés. In Wisconsin the income from fees, etc., is 
turned. over to the State. The State appropriations, therefore, 
in Wisconsin cover all receipts for State normal schools. In com- 
puting these percentages the State plan was not followed. The

receipts from the various sources were considered as in other States 
for the reason that the State in reality appropriated so much less 
from public funds, since such receipts really contribute to the State 
appropriations. A similar remark may be made in the case of sev- 
eral other States. (See Table 34 and footnotes.) It is obvious

from figure 15 that there is much variation in the policies of the 
different States in the support of their State normal schools. In 
California almost all of the income for current expenses was received 
from public funds, while in Pennsylvania only 20 per cent was so 
obtained. In the latter State a number of the schools are yet semi- 
private.

EXPENDITURES. 
The variation in total expenditures of normal schools in 1917-18 
is set forth in Table 20.. One State school spent less than $7,500, 
while 54 spent more than $100,000. The county schools are the 
smallest as measured by expenditures. Only two private schools 
expended more than $60,000.

Table 21 shows the distribution of the salaries of principals and 
presidents of normal schools. Here, too, considerable differences 
obtain. No county normal school principal received $3,000. Most 
of the county normal school directors in Ohio received $950 and 
$1,000. Of the State normal school principals and presidents, 133 
received $5,000 or more. Eleven city normal school principals 
received $3,000 or more. The corresponding figure for private 
normal school presidents and principals was four. 
Classification of expenditures.—In the tables which follow the 
items are made up as follows: 
(1) Business administration includes salaries of boards, their 
traveling expenses, and similar items. 
(2) The salary of the principal needs no explanation. 
(3) Other expenses of educational administration include the 
salary of office assistants (clerical) and other office expenses. (Items 
1, 2, and 3 constitute the cost of administration.)
-P-A-G-E-45
STATISTICS OF NORMAL SCHOOLS, 1917-1918, 45 
  (4) Salaries of deans and teachers need no explanation. 
(5) Textbooks, supplies, etc., include such supplies as are used in 
instruction. (Items 4 and 5 constitute the cost of instruction.) 
(6) Operation of school plant includes wages of janitors, engineers, 
etc., and wages paid persons connected with demonstration farms 
and with dormitories; cost of fuel, water, and light; janitors’ supplies; 
and similar expenses of operation. 
(7) Maintenance of school plant includes repair of buildings and 
upkeep of grounds, repair and replacement of equipment, and 
similar items. 3 
(8) Auxiliary agencies include salaries of librarians (sometimes 
reported under salaries of instructors), books and library supplies, 
athletics and promotion of health, lunches, lecture courses, printing, etc. 
(9) Fixed charges include rent, insurance, contributions, and con- 
tingencies. (Items 8 and 9 constitute the expenses for miscellaneous 
items.) 
Detailed expenditures of 58 State normal schools.—For a detail study 
of expenditures of State normal schools, 58 schools were selected. 
Those chosen reported the total number of attendance weeks and 
distribution of their expenditures. Several other schools reported 
these data, but due to the nature of the method used only a limited 
number could be included. The list is thought to be afairsample. It 
contains schools from 27 of the 42 States which have State normal 
schools. From Table 22 it appears that they fairly represent the 
situation with regard to the number of attendance weeks, since the 
schools included therein have from 1,558, in the smallest, to 39,116 in 
the largest school. The greatest possible variation on this score, as 
indicated in Table 13, is limited to a little over 40,000 attendance 
weeks in the largest school, The schools selected are also representa- 
tive with regard to the total current expenses, since the total current 
expenses vary from $12,576, in the school having the lowest amount, 
to $199,212 in the school having the largest amount, as shown in 
Table 26. The highest corresponding expenditure incurred by any 
State normal school is $313,167, as shown in Table 20. The general 
tendencies in the distribution of expenditures can be noted from a 
study of the practice in these schools. Any other school can easily 
be compared with these data if the number of attendance weeks and 
the distribution of expenditures are known.

et ge &             1 These students were enrolled in extension and in correspondence courses. They are not considered in 
any ratios which are used in this discussion of expenditures. 
2? For colored persons. 
  In this study of expenditures of 58 State normal schools each insti- 
tution is assigned a significant number. Table 22 shows the scheme 
of numbering used. The schools-are here arranged in serial order 
according to the number of attendance weeks, the one with the 
largest number of attendance weeks being number 1, etc. The 
number of a school, therefore, denotes the relative size of the insti- 
tution which it represents. Thus school number 29 is about the 
average size, school number 4 is large, school number 57 is small, etc. 
This scheme is to be kept in mind as the reader follows the discussion 
and reads the accompanying figures. | 
In this study no account is taken of the nonresident students in 
extension and in correspondence courses. The number so enrolled is 
given in Table 22. These, of course, add to the amount of current 
expenditures, but there is no convenient means of including them in | 
the ratios which are used. Possibly the exclusion of nonresident 
students may explain why certain schools have relatively very high | 
expenditures per attendance week. 
The data of Table 24 were derived from the corresponding data of 
Table 23 by dividing each item for each school by the number of
-P-A-G-E-47
STATISTICS OF NORMAL SCHOOLS, 1917-1918, 47 
  attendance weeks reported for the school, that is, by dividing for each 
school the data in columns 8 to 16, inclusive, of Table 23 by the data 
in column 2 of the same table. Table 23 also shows the median cost 
and the upper and the lower limits of the middle half of the costs for 
the various purposes. 
To obtain the median here used the various costs per attendance 
week for the same purpose in the different schools were arranged in 
serial order, the largest being first. The middle cost was then taken 
as the median. When there was an even number of costs in the series 
so arranged, the higher one of the two middle costs was taken as the 
median. In a similar manner the upper and the lower limits of the 
middle half of the costs were obtained, the series being divided into 
four nearly equal parts, instead of into two parts as in the case of the 
median. The middle half is frequently called the ‘‘zone of safety.” 
Table 24 is to be read as follows: School No. 58 spends per attend- 
ance week $18.25 for all current expenses, $1.35 for the salary of the 
principal, $0.34 for other expenses of educational administration, 
$9.82 for salaries of deans and teachers, $0.68 for textbooks and sup- 
plies for instruction, ete. 
In order to facilitate comparison, the data of Table 25 were com- 
puted. These were obtained from Table 24 by dividing each item 
in it by the median for the corresponding item. Table 25 is thus a 
table of ratios as is indicated by its heading. The median ratios and 
the upper and the lower limits of the middle half of the ratios are 
given. These aid in interpreting the data of the table. 
Table 25 is to be read as follows: School No. 58 spends per attend- 
ance week 2.84 times the median amount (see Table 24 for median 
amount) for all current expenses, 4.66 times the median amount for 
the salary of the principal, 2.12 times the median amount for other 
expenses of educational administration, etc.

  54 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
  Explanation of Fig. 16. How 58 State normal schools spend their money. 
To read curves observe: 
Schools are numbered according to the total number of attendance weeks in each, No. 1 being the largest 
and 58 the smallest. (See Table 22.) Each radius represents a school. 
Beginning with school No. 58, schools are arranged around the circle in the order of the cost (current 
expenses) per attendance week; No. 58 having the highest cost; No. 51, the next highest; No. 56, the 
next highest; ete. The spiral curve shows what part this cost per attendance week is of the median cost. 
Thus, school No. 58 spends 2.84 times the median cost, which is indicated by circle No. 1. The arrows 
in the central part of each figure indicate the schools which fall within the “middle half”’ on the cost per 
attendance week. A 
In each part of figure 16, some function of expenditures is shown by means of the “dotted” zigzag curve 
In each case the medianis1. Ifa school falls between the two heavy “long-dash” circles, itis within the 
“middle half” or “safety zone’’ on the function charted. is 
Forillustration, note the third radius representing school No. 56in each chart, Parts I-VI. This school 
spends almost two and a half times as much per attendance week for current expenses as the median cost. 
This relationship is indicated by the relative distances of the ‘‘spiral” and the “median” from the “O” 
circle on radius 56. The cost in this school is considerably above “middle half.” 
In Part I this school spends almost three times as much for administration per attendance week as the 
median cost. On this score the cost is also above the “middle half,”’ since the “dotted” curve meets 
radius 56 beyond the outer “long-dash” circle. 
In Part II this school spends for instruction per attendance week 1.75 times the median cost. On this 
score, also, the cost is above the “middle half.”” 
In Part III this school spends for the operation ofits plant over 5 times as much per attendance week as 
the median cost. Again, it is considerably above the “middle half.”” 
In Part IV, a similar statement applies for the cost of maintenance. 
In Part V no data were submitted on the cost of miscellaneous items. 
In Part VI certainitems in Parts I and II are combined to show the amount spent per attendance week 
for the salaries of principals, deans, and teachers. In school No. 56 the amount spent for salaries per 
attendance week is 1.8 times the median cost. The cost is above the “middle half,” since the dotted 
curve meets this radius beyond the outer “long-dash”’ circle. 
By noting the distances of the points on the curves from the “0” circle, it is possible in figure 
16 to compare the expenditures of one school with those of any other school for any function of expense. 
In Part I, for example, school No. 53 spends over twice as much per attendance week for administration 
as does school No. 52, since the “dotted” curve meets radius 53 twice as far from the “0” circle as the 
point of intersection of this curve with radius 52is distant from the “0” circle. 
  
The data of Table 25 are illustrated in figure 16, Parts Ito VI. In 
all parts of figure 16 and in Tables 23, 24, and 25, the order of the 
schools is the same. Attention is again called to the fact that the 
numbers of the schools indicate the relative sizes of the schools as 
measured by the number of attendance weeks. This means that the 
numbers have a significance in the interpretation of figure 16. 
The spiral curve indicates the ratios between the amounts spent 
per attendance week for all current expenses and the median amount 
for all current expenses (see Table 25, column 2). The spiral curve 
was used to represent the total current expenses rather than to 
represent any single function of expense so that comparison might 
easily be made. The spiral could represent any other item, in which 
case the spiral would not be the same and the order of schools would 
be governed by the order of the deviations of the function from the 
median. Schools falling within the middle half on the total cost of 
current expenses per attendance week are indicated in the middle of 
figure 16 (‘Middle half—Current expenses’’). 
The limits of the middle half of the ratios on the various other 
items (administration, instruction, etc.) are indicated by the ‘“long-
-P-A-G-E-55
  
STATISTICS OF NORMAL SCHOOLS, 1917-1918, 55 
dash”’ circles. Thus if the “‘dotted’’ curve meets any radius between 
the two “long-dash”’ circles, the school represented by that radius 
spends for the item considered an amount within the middle half as 
indicated at the bottom of Table 24. 
It is to be noted in considering the middle half that it may be 
creditable to an institution to be located either below or above the 
middle half on certain items. Thus, for instance, it would seem 
altogether creditable for a school to be above the middle half on

cost of instruction or to be below the middle half on expenses of 
operation of school plant. A-school having a very high total cost per 
attendance week will not usually fall within the middle zone on any 
item of expense. Thus the ‘“dotted’’ curve will seldom enter this 
zone for the 14 schools having the highest cost per attendance week. 
Similarly, the “dotted’’ curve will usually fall below this zone for 
the 15 schools having the lowest cost per attendance week. 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  56 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
The dotted curve of figure 16, Part I, shows that the cost for 
administration per attendance week, in general, tends to be high 
when the cost for current expenses per attendance week is high, and 
low when the cost per attendance for current expenses is low, which 
is indicated by the fact that the dotted curve tends to follow the 
spiral curve. In several cases there are notable exceptions such as 
schools Nos. 52 and 39, which are low on this item, ahd schools Nos.

9,27, 21, and 48, which are comparatively high on this item. Thereis 
perhaps some error in the reports in the cases where the curve for 
administration falls beyond the scale. 
Attention is called to the fact that on the spiral curve practically 
all of the schools above the middle half (No. 58, through 51, to and 
including 45) are indicated by large numbers, which means that they 
are the smaller schools. This likely accounts for the high cost per

attendance week for current expenses in these institutions. Most of 
the schools below the median on the spiral (No. 36, through 14, to 
and including 38) are indicated by small numbers, thus signifying 
that they are the larger schools. This seems to point out that the 
larger schools are the less expensive. 
Two types of comparisons are possible in these figures. The first 
type is that of noting how one particular school stands on any one

item, or on all items of expense as related to the central tendency, 
median of middle half. Thus by noting school No. 52 on all the parts 
of figure 16 it is evident that this school is high (above the median) on 
the cost per attendance week for each purpose, though relatively 
not so high on the operation of school plant (see fig. 16, Part IIT) as 
on the other items. It enters the ‘‘safety zone’’ on no function of 
expense. Itis very high or maintenance and on miscellaneous items.

It must be kept in mind that. it is a small school, as is indicated by| 
the high number (52), and that its total current expenses per attend- 
ance week are high as indicated by the spiral curve. In similar] 
manner it may be noted that school No. 2 is below the middle half 
on administration, above the median but within the middle half on| 
instruction, below the median but within the middle half on opera- 
tion, etc.

The second type of comparison is that of showing how the expendi- 
tures of one school compare with those of another school for the same 
purpose. In this the distances of the points from the ‘‘0”’ cir- 
cle are to be noted and compared. Thus, school No. 53 spends 
about twice as much per attendance week for administration 
as does school No. 52, as is explained in the directions for reading the 
figures. 
 
-P-A-G-E-59

The observation may be made that some items show much greater 
eneral variation from the median than do others, as is indicated by 
he different widths of the ‘‘middle half”’ on the different parts of 
gure 16. The ‘‘safety zones’’ are of different widths in the different 
harts. The least variation from the median is in the cost of instruc- 
ion (see fig. 16, Part II) and in salaries of principals, deans, and 
eachers (see fig. 16, Part VI), and the greatest variation is in the cost

of maintenance. In the latter case some schools may have included 
outlays in reporting maintenance. 
The relative proportion of the total current expenses going for each 
function of expense can be noted approximately on figure 16, Parts 
I-VI. If the expenditures for the various purposes in each school 
were ideally distributed, as indicated by the medians in Table 24, 
there would be no fluctuation from the spiral curve and the dotted
-P-A-G-E-60
60 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
curve would fall on the spiral curve in each part of figure 16. In 
general, it is creditable to an institution to have minor deviations 
from the ‘‘spiral.’’ When the percentage for any one item is above 
the median percentage for that item the ‘‘dotted”’ curve in general 
alls outside the spiral, and when the percentage for one item is less 
than the median percentage for that item the ‘‘dotted’’ curve falls 
within the spiral. In Part I school No. 53 is an illustration of the

former, where the ‘‘dotted”’ curve meets the radius beyond the spiral 
point. Judging from the median, this school spends too high a 
proportion of its total current expenses for administration. This 
same fact is evident in Table 27, which shows that this school spends 
14.6 per cent for administration, as compared with 8.7 per cent in 
the median school. In Part I school No. 52 is an example of the 
latter, where the dotted curve falls inside the spiral curve, and where
-P-A-G-E-61
STATISTICS OF NORMAL SCHOOLS, 1917-1918, 61 
the percentage spent for administration is less than the median 
(Table 27, column 12). This comparison holds in general, though 
there are slight differences due to the fact that the median is used 
instead of arithmetical average. The variation is usually restricted 
to about 10 per cent. In other words, when the proportion going 
for any function varies less than 10 per cent from the median propor- 
tion going for that purpose, the dotted curve is likely to fall on the 
opposite side of the spiral from that indicated by the table of per- 
centages. Where this variation is greater than 10 per cent the dotted 
curve falls within or without the spiral curve as indicated by the 
table of percentage.

Figure 17 (see page 58) shows the salaries of the principals of State 
normal schools as compared to the number of attendance weeks (indi- 
cated by the number of the school) and as compared to the total 
amount for current expenses (indicated by the spiral curve). This 
figure is to be read like figure 16, except that the order of the schools 
is nct the same as in figure 16. The data are given in Table 26.

   To show what proportion of their total current expenses the school: 
spend for the various purposes the data of Table 26 were computed 
This table is to be read as follows: The institution at Johnson, Vt. 
expended 7.4 per cent of its total current expense for the salary o 
_the principal, 1.9 per cent for other expenses of educational adminis: 
tration, 53.8 per cent for deans and teachers, etc.

‘THE GALARY OF THB PRINCIPAL AS RECATHD TO THR SALARY OF THR PRINCIPAL IN THR MEDIAN SCHOOL, (#5600). 
  Fig. 17.—The salary of the principals in 58 State normal schools. 
Explanation of figure 17. The salary of the principal in 58 State normal schools. 
To read curves observe: 
Schools are numbered as in figure 16. (See Table 22.) 
Beginning with school No. 2, schools are arranged around the circle in the decreasing order of their tota 
current expenses. Thus, school No. 2 spends 2.61 times as much as the median, or school No. 31; schoo 
No. 1 spends 2.51 times the median, ete. The salary of the principal in school No. 2 is 1.39 times the median salary, which is indicated by circle 
No. 1. The salary of this principal is above the ‘(middle half”’ since the “dotted” curve meets thi: 
radius above the outer “long-dash” circle. 
This school, being No. 2, is second in size as measured by the total number of attendance weeks. Con 
sequently a higher salary than would be indicated by the ‘‘middle zone” is to ke expected. The tota 
current expenses in this school are higher than those in any other of these 58 schools. e large amount 
of money expended is another index as to the importance of this principalship and tends to justify a salary 
above the ‘middle half.” § 
The salary of one principal may be compared with that of another by noting the relative distances o: 
the ‘‘dotted”’ curve from the “0” line. Thus, the salary paid the principal in school No. 1 is 3 times a: 
much as the salary of the principal in school No. 4. These two schools are nearly equal in size and inew 
about the same current expenses. School No. 4 is for colored persons.

Table 28 shows the percentages of Table 25 arranged in seri: 
order. This gives some idea of the variation among the differer 
percentages expended for the various functions. It also shows th 
middle half of each group of percentages. With its use the rel: 
tive expenditures of an institution can easily be compared with ti 
general practice of the 58 schools. Thus, for example, school Ni 
2 falls below the middle half on the percentage expended for bus| 
ness administration, below the middle half on the salary of the pres 
dent, below the middle half on other expenses of educational a 
ministration, above the middle half on the salaries of deans an 
teachers, above the middle half on textbooks and supplies of instru 
tion, within the middle half on operation of school plant, belo 
the middle half on maintenance, within the middle half on auxilia: 
agencies and sundry activities, and below the middle half on fixe 
charges. 
ACCURACY. 
  Every precaution was taken to secure accuracy in this study 
normal schools. There may be, however, some errors in the co: 
puted data. There seem to be a few errors in certain reports 
has been noted above in the discussion of the wide deviation fro: 
the median in the cost of maintenance. There is also a slight err 
due to using the median instead of the arithmetical mean as t! 
average. The median is a counting average and is not much affecte 
by extremely high or low cost. Thus, in Table 24 the sum of th 
median amounts in columns 3-11, inclusive, is $5.76, while th| 
median amount in column 2 is $6.43. To be ideal a school woul: 
spend $6.43 per attendance week and at the same time to be ide 
on the distribution of its expenditures the total cost per attendan 
week would be only $5.76. The variation here, it will be note 
is restricted to about 10 per cent. A similar error may be note 
in Table 28. The sum of the median percentages in columns 1-— 
inclusive, is 96.6, instead of 100. This is due to the fact that th 
median is a counting average and is not mathematically exac 
which means that extremely high and low cost do not materiall; 
affect it. In the case of the arithmetical mean or common average 
extremely high cost or low cost affects the average very materially 
In this chapter, in this study of expenditures, it is thought bes 
to use the median rather than the arithmetical average becaus 
extremely high costs for any purpose may be due to erroneou 
reports. By its use the general effect of an erroneous distribution 
of expenditures in a few schools is minimized. The median, there 
fore, shows the central tendency better than the arithmetical averag 
in studying expenditures.

GENERAL SUMMARY. 
State normal schools.—Of the types of normal schools herein dis- 
ssed the State schools are by far the most important in the train- 
ig of teachers. These institutions have increased in number in the 
riod 1900-1918. They have also increased in size as measured by 
e average size of faculty, the average enrollment, the average size 
library, and the average income. 
The distribution tables on the number of instructors, the enroll- 
ent, the amount of practice teaching, the model and practice school
-P-A-G-E-70
    70 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
enrollment, the property valuation, the size of library, and the to 
expenditures indicate that there is great variation among the diff 
ent State normal schools in these respects. 
Wide differences exist in the policies of the different States rega: 
ing their State normal schools. Several States provide many insti 
tions, while a number of States provide only one or two. Only 
States have State normal schools separately organized; 3 States ha 
State teachers’ colleges. 
The policies of administration and control are very different in t 
different States. In Wisconsin, for example, all receipts which t 
schools received from fees, productive funds, etc., are turned over 
the central State authorities. All available receipts for the scho: 
come directly from State appropriations. A somewhat similar poli 
of centralized control obtains in several other States, as in Massac 
setts and Connecticut. In most States, however, administrative co} 
trol is not so highly centralized, the individual schools having grea 
freedom in this matter. 
A third difference in State policies tae to the financial supp 
of the State normal schools. Figure 15 shows that the proporti 
of total income for current expenses which comes from public fun 
varies in the different States, it being over,97 per cent in one St 
and about 20 per cent in another. 
It is a notable fact that in later years a smaller percentage of t 
income of State normal schools was appropriated from public fun: 
than was the case in the earlier part of the period 1900-1918 (5 
fig. 13). 
The study of expenditures shows that there is great variation 
this item as to the total amounts spent by the different schools, as 
the proportionate amounts spent for various purposes. 
The summer schools are a very important feature in the work 
the State normal schools. 
City and county normal schools.—The number of city normal scho: 
remained almost the same throughout the period considered. Seve 
of these are large institutions, as was noted in the discussion of t 
distribution tables. Others are not so large, the instructors bei 
few in number and the enrollment frequently small. These scho 
usually have large practice schools and give much attention to tl 
phase of training. . 
The county normal schools are of more recent development th: 
are the city normal schools. In late years they have increas 
rapidly in number. They are becoming an important factor in 
training of teachers. é 
Private normal schools ——The number of private normal scho 
decreased rapidly in the period 1900-1918. In general, the avera; 
private normal school of later years is larger than was the aver
-P-A-G-E-71
    
STATISTICS OF NORMAL SCHOOLS, 1917-1918, TA: 
private normal school of carlier years. This means one of two 
things, either that the larger schools tend to survive or that the 
schools which continue are becoming larger. Private normal schools 
tend to become a less important factor in the training of teachers. 
They are yet, however, important in training teachers, especially 
teachers for special phases of work, such as physical education and 
kindergarten teaching.

CHAPTER II. 
STATISTICS OF PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 1917-18. 
\ContENTS.—Classification of high schools—Junior high schools—Number of high schools—Publie and 
private high schools—Size of high schools—Number of schools of each type—Amount of schooling 
afforded by the high schools—Number of instructors—The teaching load—Number of students—Dis- 
tribution of students by grades—How much schooling each student gets—Four-year schools—Rate of 
inerease in high-school enrollment—Per cent of population in high schools—What the schools offer— 
Graduates—Graduates going to college—High-school property—High-school libraries—The cost of 
high-school education—Salaries of principels—Expenditures for sites, buildings, and other permanent 
improvements—Statistical tables. 
The following pages present the statistics of public high schools, 
revealing as far as possible the direct bearing of the data collected 
on current secondary school problems. - To accomplish this end the 
presentation, necessarily, is divided into two fields: First, that 
making historical comparisons, and second, that showing present con- 
ditions. The first shows trend or evolution; the second, status or 
accomplishment. The former treatment is limited by the scope of 
all previous inquiries; the latter, only by the brevity of the statisti- 
cal schedule now in use. As the statistics of public and private 
high schools were not tabulated separately previous to 1890, no 
attempt has been made to antedate this beginning in the establish- 
ment of historical trends. Where the statistics of private high 
schools have been incorporated, their inclusion has been definitely 
indicated. The basis used in separating the public and private 
high school is that of control. A secondary school controlled by a 
publicly elected or appointed board of education has been consid- 
ered as a public high school—all others as private high schools or 
academies. As the classification adopted may not always conform 
to the local conception of a public or private high school, some of 
‘the schools locally considered as public may have been included in 
the report on private high schools, or vice versa. As the list of 
public high schools is very large, the detailed statistics of each school 
have not been printed. State summaries, however, have been made, 
and grand summaries for the United States. The statistics have 
been focalized by means of graphic presentations, disclosing im- 
portant relationships not readily apparent in tabular form. 
CLASSIFICATION OF HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Probably no one factor has influenced the development of the 
modern high school more than the standards determined by the, 
123 :  
-P-A-G-E-124
  124 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
various accrediting associations and bodies. There is no national ac- 
crediting association which would serve to bring all high schools up 
to the same minimum standard. The sectional accrediting associa- 
tions have different standards. It may not be possible for a repre- 
sentative number of high schools in each State to meet the standards 
established by one of these sectional associations operating in another 
part of the country. Consequently, greater fairness will ensue if the 
classification of high schools determined by each State prevails. Or- 
dinarily, the high schools in a State are rated by the State board of 
education, or by the State superintendent of public instruction, to 
determine the fitness of their graduates to meet college entrance re- 
quirements. The standards set vary in the different States, but gen- 
erally a school is not given first rating unless it offers four years of 
secondary work and meets the entrance requirements prescribed by the 
State university or some other recognized college or university. Ina 
few instances the State university prepares the classification of high 
schools. In this report the high schools in each State are divided 
into. three classes, viz, fully accredited, partially accrediied or recog- 
nized, and nonaccredited high schools. The first class includes those 
schools whose graduates are unconditionally admitted to collegiate 
work in the State university or some other generally recognized 
standard college or university. The second class of schools includes 
those whose work is recognized by the college or university for meet- 
ing only a part of the prescribed entrance requirements, and which 
either do not offer four years of secondary work or offer some work 
of.a lower grade than the college or university cares to recognize. 
On the other hand, partially accredited schools may not offer a cur- 
riculum including some of the subjects which first-class schools offer. 
These schools are generally of lower grade than the fully accredited 
schools. The third class of schools includes all high schools which 
have not yet been officially recognized by the accrediting body. In 
a few States such*schools do not exist.. In a few other States many 
important schools, refusing to comply with the standards set by the 
State accrediting body, are still in this class. But in general the 
nonaccredited schools are of lower grade than the partially accred- 
ited high schools. In every case the classification used is the one 
reported to the United States Bureau of Education by the State 
superintendent of public instruction. So many problems are con- 
tingent upon these classifications that the data reported by the 
various high schools have been tabulated accordingly. 
The reports also have been tabulated to show the statistics of 
four-year, three-year, two-year, and one-year high schools. As 
many four-year high schools are not fully accredited, the preceding 
classification as to grade does not suffice for all purposes. In this 
classification the States are fairly and impartially compared. No

local definition operates to put any State at a disadvantage. The 
further importance of this grouping will appear in proper sequence. 
Another classification of the data supplied has been made to show 
separately the statistics of city and rural high schools. This classi- 
fication has been made on the basis of support, it being generally 
agreed that rural support will look toward rural interests, and city 
support toward city interests. The following definition of a rural 
high school has been used in grouping the reports: A rural high school 
is one supported by a State, a county, a township, or a district 
(not in the sense of a single school district), or by.an independent 
village which had a population less than 2,500 in 1910. Union 
high schools are considered as rural. A city high school is one sup- 
ported by a city having a population of 2,500 and over in 1910. 
Many of the rural high schools are located in cities having a population 
of 2,500 or over, and in many instances serve as city high schools as 
well, but are supported by a rural taxing unit, i. e., by a unit larger 
than that determined by the corporate limits of the city proper. 
In case the city had a population of 10,000 or over, such a dual high 
school has been considered as a city high school, it being thought 
that such a large municipality would more generally determine the 
curriculum of the high school and would contribute very largely to 
its support. These city high schools have been divided into two 
groups, the first including all of those high schools supported by 
cities which had a population of 5,000 or over, and the second those 
supported by cities having a population from 2,500 to 4,999 in 1910. 
There are about as many cities in the first group as in the second, 
but about twice as many high schools. This division enables one 
to compare, roughly, the statistics of high schools in the larger 
cities in 1918 with the corresponding data for city schools found in the 
preceding statistical report of the Commissioner of Education. If 
some are inclined to question the practice of considering as cities 
municipalities having a population from 2,500 to 4,999, the statis- 
tics of the high schools located in such places may be combined with 
those of rural high schools. To facilitate reference to these two 
classes of cities in the following pages the larger municipalities are 
denominated ‘‘cities” and the smaller ones, ‘“‘villages.”’ 
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS. 
A further classification of high-school statistics has also been 
made to show the present status of the junior high school movement. 
In no case have any pupils in the sixth grade been considered as 
junior high-school pupils. In only a very few instances has an 
organization of the seventh and eighth grades alone been considered 
as a junior high school, it being thought that such a plan savored  
-P-A-G-E-126
    126 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
ally, the junior high school includes pupils in the seventh, eighth, 
and ninth grades, and the senior high school, students in the tenth, 
eleventh, and twelfth grades. In no case has a junior high-school 
organization been allowed to appear in this report if the senior high 
school associated with it did not continue through the twelfth grade, 
thereby giving opportunity to all students to complete a four-year 
secondary course. The rigidity with which the reports were edited 
in these respects has probably reduced the statistics of junior high 
schools to a truthful minimum. The inclusion of the statistics of 
junior high schools in this report has not obliterated the purely 
secondary school statistics and has not vitiated historical com- 
parisons. 
High schools which have not been organized into junior and 
senior high schools, but which are still operated on the conventional 
two-year, three-year, or four-year plan are called ‘‘regular” bigh 
schools in this report.

STATISTICS OF PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 1917-1918. i181 
NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The total number of high schools included in this report is 13,951. 
‘his number represents an increase of 1,948 over the number report- 
¢ in 1916. The mailing list maintained by. the Bureau of Educa- 
ion includes the names of 16,300 public high schools. This mailing 
has been compiled from lists of high schools supplied by the 
arious State officers of education, and undoubtedly is complete. 
t is, therefore,-evident that 2,349 high schools did not submit a 
eport to this office in 1918. The other figures in Table 1 showing 
lhe number of schools reporting are probably correspondingly small. 
‘he number of public high schools has increased over 452 per cent 
ince 1890. Some concrete conception of this enormous increase 
ay be gained when it is noted that more than one high school has 
een established each day in each calendar year since 1890—a high 
chool a day for 28 years.        
    
   
   
          
       
   
   
    
    
     PUBLIC AND PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The comparative importance of public and private high schools 
n educating the youth of the Nation is shown graphically in figure 1. 
n 1890, when the statistics of public and private high schools were 
st treated separately, only 60.8 per cent of the high schools in the 
ountry were under public control. In 1918 over 87 per cent of all 
econdary schools reporting are under public control. These per- 
entages are not so significant, however, as those pertaining to the 
tudent body. At the former date 68 per cent of all high-school 
tudents were enrolled in public schools; at the latter date the cor- 
esponding percentage had risen to 91.2 These complementary 
thanges should not be misconstrued. It is shown in the report 
m private high schools that the increase in enrollment in these 
chools has about kept pace with the increase in population. In 
gure 18 it is seen that public high school enrollment has advanced 
t a much more rapid rate than the mere increase in population 
ould indicate. It is, therefore, seen that the changes evident in 
igure 1 are not due to an absolute decrease in the status of private 
igh schools, but to the phenomenal increase in the importance of 
public high schools. The ‘“‘student’’ curve in this figure runs above 
the ‘‘school”’ curve because the average public high school enrolls a 
larger student body than the average private high school. 
SIZE OF HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The rapid progress made by the present high-school movement 
has brought into existence a number of small high schools which 
have not yet reached “maturity.” With the growth of cities large 
high schools develop; with the movement to carry high-school ad- 
vantages to rural children many small high schools spring up. Upon

   the size of these high schools depends the possibility of offering a 
narrow, or an enriched, program of studies. The State course of 
study for secondary schools must conform largely to the size of high 
schools which it is destined to govern. With the large high school

comes a larger teaching staff and an opportunity to offer commercial, 
home economics, manual training, trade training, and teacher train- 
ing subjects, as well as the usual academic work. The smaller high 
schools with only one, two, or three teachers can not hope to offer

so great a variety of training and usually limit their activity to giv- 
ing the academic subjects, or possibly a small amount of work in 
agriculture. 
The development of athletic activities must necessarily be re- 
stricted in these smaller schools. So vital is this information thought 
to be to those who determine the policies of the high schools that a 
careful study has been made concerning the distribution of high 
schools in each State according to the number of students enrolled. 
Junior high school students have been included in this analysis.

If the high schools in the United States are assembled in groups 
in such a manner that group one includes all schools enrolling 1 to 
25 students; group two, those schools with 26 to 50 students; group 
three, the schools having from 51 to 75 students, etc., itis found that 
almost one-fourth of the high schools in this country have fewer 
than 26 students, and over one-fourth of them from 26 to 50 stu- 
dents. Thus over one-half of the high schools have an enrollment 
not exceeding 50 students. Less than 5 per cent of the high schools 
have an enrollment exceeding 500 students. These facts are shown 
in Table 3 and in figure 2. 
In this figure, also, similar curves have been constructed for Cali- 
fornia and Massachusetts, both of which have comparatively large 
percentages of schools enrolling a large number of students, and for 
Montana and Virginia, both of which have comparatively large per- 
centages of very small schools. Clearly, the curricula possible in the 
   
-P-A-G-E-134
134 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
larger schools in California and Massachusetts could not be prescribed 
for the smaller schools in Montana and Virginia. It is shown below 
that the per student cost in larger high schools is less than that in 
small high schools. It can not be maintained, therefore, that greater 
efficiency will, necessarily, result from a large per capita cost in sec-

not have an enrollment exceeding 50 students. In California only 
one-sixth of the high schools are so small. More elaborate high-school 
activities, therefore, can be required of the high schools in California 
than of the high schools in Virginia.

  138 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
The data exhibited in Table 5 were secured in the following manner: 
The high schools in each State were arranged in the order of the total 
number of students enrolled in each school, beginning with the smallest 
and advancing to the largest. The enrollment in the smallest school 
and in the largest school in each State is shown in the table. The 
school one-fourth of the way from the smallest to the largest school 
is called the first quartile school; the one half-way up the array, the 
median school; the one three-fourths the way up, the third quartile 
school. Thus, one-fourth of the high schools in the United States 
enroll from 2 to 27 students; another fourth, from 27 to 50 students; 
another fourth, from 50 to 100 students, and the last fourth, over 100 
students. 
Similarly, one-half of the 13,951 high schools in the country have 
an enrollment between 27 and 100 students. A distribution of all the 
high schools in each State also appears in this table. 
These facts for the different States are shown graphically in figure 3. 
The States are here arranged in the order of the magnitude of the 
median school. Rhode Island (the District of Columbia not being 
considered) has the largest and North Dakota the smallest median 
school. In Rhode Island as many schools have an enrollment greater 
than 210 students as have an enrollment less than that number. 
In North Dakota the corresponding dividing line is the school enrolling 
only 29 students. If the arithmetical average had been used instead 
of the median, the graph would tell a different story. Thus New 
York would come seventh in the list instead of sixteenth, the very 
large high schools in New York City having a tendency to draw the 
average away from the median for the State. The inadequacy of the 
arithmetical mean to describe this central tendency is clearly shown 
in this instance, since over three-fourths of the high schools in New 
York State have an enrollment less than the average. A similar 
condition prevails in many other States. In fact, over three-fourths 
of all high schools in the United States have an enrollment consider- 
ably less than the average, the average being 124 and the third quartile 
only 100. 
The dotted line at the left in figure 3 indicates the enrollment in 
the smallest school in each State. Thus, Utah has the largest smallest 
school, and Iowa the smallest smallest school. The left end of the 
black bar in each State indicates the size of the first quartile school 
and the right end of the bar the size of the third quartile school. 
The bars embrace the zone including the middle half of the schools in 
each State. Thus, in Massachusetts one-half of the schools enroll 
from 55 to 520 students. A short bar indicates that one-half (middle) 
the schools in a State are about the same size, while a long bar indicates 
a wider distribution. A few very large schools do not operate mate- 
rially in prolonging the bar.:

140 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
_ It is of interest to note that a few high schools have a very large 
enrollment. Altogether, 632 schools (see Table 4) in the United 
States enroll over 500 students, and 278 schools enroll over 1,000 
students. These schools are larger than most colleges and univer- 
sities, and employ large faculties and offer a wide variety of subjects. 
The five largest high schools in the United States reporting to the 
Bureau of Education in 1917-18 are named below: 
(1) Polytechnic Evening High School (for boys), Los Angeles, Calif. Enrollment, 
8,440. 
(2) Commercial High School (for boys), Brooklyn, N. Y. Enrollment, 7,508. 
(3) Morris High School (coeducational), New York, N. Y. Enrollment, 6,733. 
(4) Washington Irving High School (for girls), New York, N. Y. Enrollment, 5,785. 
(5) Stuyvesant High School (for boys), New York, N. Y. Enrollment, 5,325. 
In no ease do they include the elementary grades of junior high 
schools. In fact, they have not been organized into junior and 
senior departments.

do not definitely indicate the percentage of students enrolled in 
these large schools. While, relatively, few schools are very large, 
they enroll a large percentage of the student body. In figure 4 it is 
shown that 5 per cent of the schools enroll almost 44 per cent of all 
students. Twenty per cent of the schools enroll seven-tenths of — 
the students. Conversely, one-half of the students enrolled are 
found in about 7 per cent of the schools. If each school enrolled 
exactly the same number of students, the curve of actual distribu-

tion would follow the line of equal distribution. The bowing of the 
former away from the latter indicates the inequality in the distri- 
bution of students in the various high schools. Greater variation 
exists among the public high schools than among the private high 
schools, as will be observed if this figure is compared with the cor-

NUMBER OF SCHOOLS OF EACH TYPE. 
In figure 5 the public high schools and the students have been 
classified in accordance with the types of high schools for which 
statistics have been compiled. The number of city high schools 
constitutes less than 10 per cent of the total number of high schools, 
but they enroll over 52 per cent of the total number of students. 
Almost 85 per cent of the high schools are rural, but such schools

nroll only about 40 per cent of the students. The average size of 
city high school is 653 students, while that of a rural school is only 
59 students. The village high schools occupy intermediate grounds, 
s shown in the figure. 
Almost one-half of the high schools are fully accredited, and they 
nroll over 84 per cent of all students. 
The average number of students enrolled in an accredited high 
chool is 213. The recognized or partially accredited high schools 
onstitute almost 34 per cent of the total number of high schools, 
ut they enroll only 10.7 per cent of the total number of students. 
‘hey have an average enrollment of only 39. 
Over 76 per cent of all high schools offer a four-year course. These 
chools enroll over 95 per cent of the total number of students. It 
is highly significant that only 5 per cent of the students attending 
igh school do not have the advantage of taking a four-year high- 
chool course. As many of the three-year high schools annually 
volve into four-year schools, this meager 5 per cent is unquestion- 
lably too large. The average enrollment in these four-year high 
schools is 156, while the schools with shorter courses are very small. 
tt should be remembered that figure 5 includes the statistics of ele- 
mentary grades in junior high schools. 
AMOUNT OF SCHOOLING AFFORDED BY THE HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The length of the high-school course does not afford a good crite- 
rion by which to judge the actual amount of schooling offered. The 
length of the school year, or of the school term, is highly significant 
in this respect. To correlate these two factors, figure 6 has been 
prepared. The high schools are classified into four groups, accord- 
ing to the length of the school term provided. Group I includes 
all schools having a term greater than 180 days; Group II, the 
schools with a term of 161 to 180 days; Group ITI, the schools hav- 
ing a term of 141 to 160 days; and Group IV, the schools having a 
shorter term. ‘The first group includes schools with a term of 94 or 
10 months; the second, schools with a term of 84 or 9 months; the 
third, schools with a term of 74 or 8 months; and the fourth, schools 
with a shorter term. The vertical axis shows the percentage of 
schools having a course of study of one, two, three, or four years. 
The horizontal scale shows the percentage of schools having the term 
groups indicated in the legend. Thus, 76.2 per cent of all high 
schools offer a four-year course, and 64.5 per cent of these are open 
from 161 to 180 days during the year. The three-year zone is sur- 
prisingly large, but represents only a small percentage of the number 
of students, as shown correlatively in figure 16. Figure 6 represents 
the actual amount of all secondary schooling offered in 1917-18, 
since the junior high-school factor has been omitted from consid-

States to see how each compares with this common practice. 
The corresponding data have been given in tabular form for each 
State in Tables 35, 36, and 37. In the first table it is shown that 288 
schools had a term of only 140 days, or fewer. Sixty of these schools 
are in Indiana; 50, in North Carolina; 49, in Pennsylvania; and 63, in 
Texas. Altogether 9,186 high-school students have no longer term

NUMBER OF INSTRUCTORS. 
From a historical viewpoint one very significant trend is apparent 
in figure 7. Since 1902 the number of women teachers has been in- 
creasing more rapidly than the number of men teachers. At the 
present time only about 34 per cent of all high-school teachers are 
men. In 1890 only 9,120 high-school teachers were employed, but 
81,034 teachers were employed in 1918 for purely secondary work 
(omitting instructors in elementary grades of junior high schools). 
With the development of the present high-school movement, many 
new teaching positions have been created. In 28 years this demand 
for high-school teachers has increased eightfold. 
A classification of high-school teachers is given in Table 7, showing 
the number of men and women employed in each type of school. 
These figures are comparable with corresponding data for the student 
body shown in Table 8. 
THE TEACHING LOAD. 
A highly commendable trend is evident in the upper curve of figure 
8. The “teaching load,” or the average number of students to a 
teacher, has decreased from 25.5 in 1900 to 20.3 in 1918. This de- 
crease implies that the high schools are gradually giving a greater 
opportunity for more intensive work. Classes are necessarily smaller, 
or the number of recitations per teacher per day has been reduced. 
In either case more effective work will be done. The second curve 
in this figure shows only a general trend. Many extreme variations. 
are concealed in these general averages for the different years. From

the foregoing discussion concerning the size of high schools, it would 
appear that over three-fourths of the high schools have fewer teachers 
than these averages indicate, the very large high schools with large 
faculties having a tendency to displace the average considerably 
above the median, orcentral practice. In general, the curveshowsthat

the average high-school faculty is gradually getting larger despite the 
“birth” of a new generation of schools annually. In thefully accred- 
ited high schools the average number of teachers to a school is 9.7, 
and in the four-year schools 7.4. Such comparatively large faculties 
.furnish an opportunity to offer a rich program of studies, one intrin- 
sically appealing to the varied interests of adolescent boys and girls.

The teaching load in the high schools of each State is shown graph- 
ically in figures 9 and 10 for all high schools combined and for the 
various grades and types of high schools. It will be seen that Nevada 
has fewer students to a teacher than any other State, and Georgia 
has a greater number of students to a teacher than any other State. 
The teaching load varies from 12 to 27, with an average slightly above 
20. The States are ranked on the increasing order of the magnitude of 
the teaching load in all high schools. In figure 8 the teaching load in

fully accredited, partially accredited, and nonaccredited high schools is 
also shown by States. In general, the number of students to a teacher 
is larger in the fully accredited than in the partially accredited or non- 
accredited high schools—the“ dotted’’ curve running to the right of all 
other curves. The teaching load is an important point for considera- 
tion in rating or classifying high schools. The‘‘dead line” determined 
by the North Central Association is set at 25 students per teacher.!

_ By this standard the average fully accredited high schools in Georgia 
and North Carolina would not be recognized. Possibly, if the average 
daily attendance, instead of enrollment, had been used in ascertaining 
the teaching load, the average fully accredited high school in these 
States might not fall beyond this ‘‘dead line.” In general, the teach- 
ing load in partially accredited and in nonaccredited high schools is 
comparatively small. 
In figure 10 it is shown that the number of students to a teacher in 
four-year schools is only slightly higher than the average for all high 
schools, the ‘‘circled”’ curve falling just beyond the continuous heavy 
curve. Rural high schools have, generally, small teaching loads, as 
is shown by the tendency of the ‘‘dash” curve to fall to the left of the 
average for all high schools. The teaching load in city high schools 
quite frequently extends beyond the ‘‘dead line” of 25, indicating 
that large high schools have a tendency to overload the teaching 
force. The data on which the curves in figures 9 and 10 depend are 
given in Table 16.

152 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
NUMBER OF STUDENTS. 
The total number of high-school students (including 90,448 pupils 
in the elementary grades of junior high schools) enrolled in the 13,951 
high schools reporting to the Bureau of Education in 1918 is 1,735,619, 
as shown in Table 8. Some conception as to the meaning of this 
great number may be gained from the following illustrations: If 
these students were stationed at intervals of 3 feet, they would form 
a line 983 miles long, which would reach from Washington to Kansas 
City. This line would more than encircle the State of Pennsylvania. 
Walking at the rate of 3 miles an hour and 8 hours a day, it would 
take a high-school inspector 41 days to review this line. If these 
students were brought together in a compact mass at intervals of 3 
feet, they would cover a farm of 359 acres. 
Since 1890 the total high-school enrollment has increased 710 per 
cent, while the total population has increased only 68 per cent. 
Of the 1,645,171 secondary students, 704,856 are boys and 940,315 
are girls. Over one-half of the total high-school enrollment, or 57.2 
per cent, consists of girls. In fact, the number of girl students has 
been larger than the number of boys each year represented in figure 
11.. There has been, however, little change since 1890 in the propor- 
tion of girls and boys. In 1890, girls constituted 57.7 per cent of the 
students; in 1900 the corresponding per cent had increased to 58.3; | 
in 1910 it had decreased to 56.4; in 1916 it decreased still further 
to 54.6 but in 1918 it had risen to 57.2. The increase in the pro- 
portion of girls in 1918 was probably due to war conditions—the boys 
going to work, the girls continuing in high school. 
The number of colored students included in figure 11 is shown 
separately in figure 12. One striking feature of this graph is that 
the number of colored girls enrolled in high schools has been for a 
number of years almost double the number of colored boys. Another 
significant deduction to be drawn from figures 11 and 12 is that the 
total number of colored students has increased only 256 per cent, 
while the number of white students has increased 724 per cent, or 
almost three times as rapidly. 
This tendency implies that racial differences in educational achieve- 
ments are becoming more widely divergent from year to year. The 
slight falling off in the number of colored students in 1918 was un- 
doubtedly due to the war. 
It is of interest to compare the enrollment in a given high-school 
grade with the enrollment in the next higher grade the following 
year. Thus the enrollment shown in the first year of high school in 
1907 in figure 13 (288,748) becomes the enrollment in the second 
year of the course in 1908 (209,265), the third-year enrollment in 
1909 (149,955), and the fourth year class in 1910 (111,444). Similarly 
_ the freshman class in 1915 (543,026) becomes the sophomore class in

1916 (391,301), the junior class in 1917 (288,985, estimated), and 
the senior class in 1918 (239,160). These statements do not take 
into consideration the number of retarded or repeating students in 
each grade. As the retardation percentages are not essentially Ks).

pass forward from one grade to another, this factor does not operate 
sufficiently to vitiate deductions concerning survival percentages.

reported is presumably a minor factor, since the shifting of families 
from one locality to another less frequently necessitates that high- 
school students change schools than that elementary school children 
do so. At any rate the percentages of retardation and duplication 
for the different years are about equal and are therefore inoperative

then, that the number of students in the first year of high school

156 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
various classes. Thus it each number in each complete series given 
in figure 13 is divided by the first the survival percentages shown in 
Table 2 are obtained. 
To secure a series of average survival percentages the average 
enrollment in the first year of high school from 1907 to 1915 (418,450), 
inclusive, has been divided into the average enrollment in the second 
year from 1908 to 1916 (291,499); into the average enrollment in 
the third year from 1909 to 1917 (214,768), and into the average 
fourth year enrollment from 1910 to 1918 (172,592)... The quotients, 
100.0, 69.7, 51.3, and 41.2, represent rather stable survival percent- 
ages, practically uninfluenced by the annual variations in the number 
of schools reporting. 
It should be remarked that some of the school mortality resulting 
from the use of the data shown in figure 13 is due to the fact that 
about five per cent of the students in high school are enrolled in 
schools offering a course of study of one, two, or three years only. 
Unfortunately, the enrollment by grades in four-year high schools 
has not been shown for the years preceding 1918, thereby making it 
impossible to eliminate this factor from consideration. It is not pos- 
sible to ascertain from preceding reports the number of graduates of 
four-year high schools, since the total number of graduates always 
includes those who completed the curricula of two-year and three- 
year schools. For this reason the ‘“‘graduate’”’ curve oftens runs 
above the “‘fourth-year-enrollment” curve in figure 13. 
It is possible, however, from this report to ascertain information 
which permits the computation of the percentage representing the 
number completing a four-year high-school course. The 10,638 four- 
year high schools reported a total enrollment of 239,160 students in the 
fourth year of the course, and 210,279 graduates. The latter number 
contains no duplicates. The former number may contain duplicates, 
since students moving from one high school to another during the 
year may be counted by both schools. In the chapter on State 
school systems it is shown that 10.8 per cent of the enrollment figures 
reported to the Bureau of Education are duplicates. Assuming | 
that the duplication in the fourth year high school is only 5 per cent, 
it is found that 92.5 per cent of those actually enrolled in the fourth 
year will graduate. By applying this percentage (92.6) to the fourth- 
year survival percentage for the class entering in 1915, it is found 
that out of each 1,000 students in 1915 entering high school, 721 will 
reach the second year; 582 the third year; 440 the fourth year; and 407 
will graduate in 1918. It is shown below that 28 per cent of these 
graduates will go to college and an additional 14 per cent to other 
than collegiate institutions. The corresponding percentages for the 
same years shown in the chapter on State school systems, when 
reduced to this basis, although computed in a different manner, are
-P-A-G-E-157
  STATISTICS OF PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 1917-1918. 157 
not essentially different. They are: First year, 1,000; second year, 
725; third year, 525; fourth year, 449; and graduating, 418. As- 
suming that these figures are essentially correct, and applying the 
percentages shown above (28 and 14), it is found that 117 of these 
graduates will go to college and an additional 59 will go to other 
schools the year following graduation. (In the chapter on colleges 
and universities of this Biennial Survey it is found that 73 per cent 
more high school graduates actually enter college than high school 
principals reported. This discrepancy is partly accounted for by 
the fact that many high school graduates do not enter college the 
year immediately following graduation.) If the percentage (92.6) 
is applied to the average number reaching the fourth year from 1910 
to 1918, the following ratios obtain: First year, 1,000; second year, 
697; third year, 513; fourth-year, 412; graduating, 382. This series 
of ratios, however, represents past rather than current conditions. 
A highly commendable tendency is in evidence in the fourth year 
survival percentages shown in Table 2. Only 38.5 per cent of those 
beginning in 1907 reach the fourth year in 1910, while in 1918 the 
corresponding percentage reaching this advanced grade had increased 
to 44.0 This-increase has not been wholly due to the more effective 
holding power of the high schools. Part of it must be attributed to 
the fact that an increasing percentage of students are being enrolled 
in four-year schools, thereby reducing mortality by giving them an 
opportunity to advance to the next higher grade. 
The public high schools have greater influence in keeping the girls 
in school than they do in holding the boys, as evidenced in figure 14. 
Of the 654,935 secondary students enrolled in the first year, only 45.3 
per cent were boys, indicating that more girls than boys enter high 
school. In the second year the percentage of boys is still smaller, 
viz, 42.7. In the third year the corresponding percentage of boys 
reduces to 41 and in the fourth year to 38.8. While the data on which 
this graph is constructed relate to the same school year, 1917-18, they 
do indicate, roughly, the relative inadequacy of our high schools in 
attracting and holding the boys. When the fourth-year class in 1918 
entered high school in 1915, 47.4 per cent of its membership consisted 
of boys. By the time these students reached the fourth year the 
number of boys constituted only 38.8 per cent of its total membership. 
The first-year class in 1916, with 47.4 per cent of boys, had only 41 
per cent of boys when it became the third-year class in 1918. It is 
seen, therefore, that mortality is greater among the boys than it is 
among the girls in the public high schools. This condition, however, 
does not exist in the private high schools. In the chapter on private 
high schools it is shown that the boys constitute 45.8 per cent of the 
first-year enrollment, 45.6 per cent of the second-year enrollment, 46
-P-A-G-E-158
158 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
per cent of the third-year enrollment, and 44.6 per centof the fourth- 
year enrollment. From these figures it does not appear that there 
is much difference between the mortality of boys and girls in the 
2,058 private high schools reporting. :

in the fourth year. If the same number of students entered high 
school each year, if all were enrolled in four-year high schools, and if 
none dropped out, these percentages would be equal. If this condi- 
tion prevailed, the four curves shown in figure 15 would constitute a 
single line coinciding with the 25 per cent line. The increase in first- 
year enrollment is commendable and may be expected to continue,

ists, the curves in figure 15 can never meet. ‘If only this factor oper-

the 27.9 per cent line. In other words, as the high-school mortality 
is reduced, the four-year curve is asymptotic to 22.3 per cent, the 
three-year curve to 24 per cent, the two-year curve to 25.8 per cent, 
and the one-year curve to 27.9 per cent. The area embracing these

theoretical lines is termed in the figure “‘the zone of ideal grade dis- 
tribution.” When high-school mortality no longer exists, the actual 
curves will fall within this zone. The fact that they are approaching 
it is hopeful indeed. - The first year of high school still contains its’ 
undue share of students, or rather the last three years of high school 
do not enroll their proportionate share. 
HOW MUCH SCHOOLING EACH STUDENT GETS. 
Almost unanimous practice prevails in giving to each boy and 
girl enrolled in the secondary schools an opportunity to take a four- 
year high-school course, as shown in figure 16. In fact, only about

the greater proportion of this small percentage have the advantage 
of a three-year high school. Of the students enrolled in a four-year 
high school, nearly one-half (47.3 per cent) are in schools maintained 
longer than 180 days annually. Almost all of the other one-half of 
this group of students (48.8 per cent) are found to be enrolled in 
schools running from 161 to 180 days each year, only ‘3.9 per cent

being enrolled in the four-year high schools having a term of 160 
days or fewer. In the three-year high schools over one-third (392. 
per cent) of the students have a term as short as 160 days. Over 
one-half (56.6 per cent) of the students enrolled in these three-year 
high schools have a term of 161 to 180 days. Only afew (4.2 per cent) 
of these students are enrolled in high schools which are in session 
longer than 180 days. The large “‘open” area in this graph portends 
that the length of the high-school term is destined to increase. When
-P-A-G-E-161
  
  STATISTICS OF PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 1917-1918,” 161 
a four-year high school has been established, the next vital problem 
confronting school administrators is how to get still more schooling. 
The solution seems to lie partly in an extension of the school term. 
The.junior college, also, has come in certain sections of the country 
to satisfy this demand for increased educational opportunities. A 
very important factor tending to promote the adoption of a longer 
school term is that great waste results if the high-school building is 
not utilized the year around. Many of the new high-school buildings 
cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. To use this property for only 
180 days out of 365 days is bad management. To keep boys and 
girls in school for 180 days during the year, and to allow most of 
them to spend their time idly during the other months in the year, 
is likewise poor judgment. To solve these vital school problems a 
longer school term is unmistakably foreshadowed in the diagram. 
FOUR-YEAR SCHOOLS. 
Every high school begins with one year of high-school work. Gen- 
erally, the next year the program of studies is expanded to cover an 
additional unit of work. Possibly, the following year another year’s 
work is added. Soon the work is again expanded into a four-year 
cwriculum. If the number of high schools “born” annually in- 
creases more rapidly than the number “promoted” from three-year 
to four-year high schools, an excessive number of short-course schools 
will accumulate. If this condition prevails, the lower curve in figure 
17 would run downward instead of upward. The steady rise in the 
curve implies that more schools are “graduated” annually into the 
four-year group than are initiated into the one-year and two-year 
groups. The rise in the curve is desirable if all of the necessary high 
schools have been established. It would seem logical to assert that 
the curve should descend until a high school is brought within the 
reach of every boy and girl. It is doubtful, therefore, whether we 
should boast that the percentage of high schools offering a four-year 
course has increased from 62.9 per cent to 76.2 within the last eight 
years. It may be much to our discredit. 
On the other hand, it is creditable to have the upper curve in figure 
17 extend upward. The number of students in newly established 
high schools is relatively small, while the number enrolled in three- 
year high schools is comparatively large. Consequently, when a 
three-year school is converted into a four-year school the whole 
student body, from freshmen to seniors, is immediately registered 
in a four-year high school. The chances are at least 4 to 1 working 
in favor of an increased enrollment in four-year high schools. 
It is almost impossible to conceive of an actual condition where 
this curve would descend, unless four-year high schools should begin 
to shorten their course. Itis highly creditable, therefore, that within

or by ether. The efficiency of any one of these means of communica- 
tion is largely determined by comparing its rate of transmission with 
the rate at which the message may be sent by other known means. 
If no other way is known judgment falters and fails. To judge 
wisely concerning the phenomenal growth of our public high-school 
enrollment, a standard rate of growth must be established. If every 
child reaching the age of 14 years since 1890 had had access to a pub- 
lic high school and had enrolled in such a school and continued in it
-P-A-G-E-163

for four years, an ideal high-school enrollment would prevail. The 
increase in high-school enrollment from year to year under such ideal 
conditions would depend wholly upon the increase in population. 
The population rate of increase and the high-school rate of increase 
would then be equal, barring lag in the curves. Fortunately, we 
know the rate of increase in the population from census reports, 64

which also represent the ultimate ideal rate of increase in public 
high-school enrollment. This rate of increase in the population is 
shown by means of index numbers in figure 18. These index numbers 
are secured by dividing the population each biennial year (see Table 
1) by the average population for the period considered (1890-1918). 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  164 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
Similarly, index numbers have been computed forthe actual high- 
school enrollment for each biennial period (1890-1918). The slope 
of each curve indicates the rate of increase, the one having the steeper 
slope between any two consecutive periods having the greater in- 
crease. Throughout the entire period considered the high-school 
‘curve shows the steeper slope. It must be concluded, therefore, 
that high-school enrollment has advanced very rapidly within the 
last quarter of a century. The curve representing it ascends with 
phenomenal speed, as if to atone for its past neglectfulness. - The 
corresponding curve for private high schools takes the same general 
direction as does the population curve. 
PER CENT OF POPULATION IN HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The high-school efficiency of a State may be determined by com- 
paring the number of students in high school with the total population. 
Of course it is not expected that the total population will ever enroll 
at one time in the secondary schools. The States will fall in about 
the same order as if the number of persons of high-school age had 
been used instead of the total population in determining the rank 
of each State. As the high-school age varies somewhat in the same 
school and considerably in the different States, the total population 
forms a comparable basis on which to secure comparative indices. 
Even with 1,645,171 children in high schools, only a very small 
fraction of the entire population is so enrolled. In 1890 only 3.2 
persons in each 1,000 of the population were enrolled in public high 
schools. In 1918 the corresponding number is 15.6, or almost five 
times as great a proportion. It is found, as shown in figure 19, 
that in California 27 persons out of each 1,000 in the population are 
found in high schools. Almost as great a proportion is found in 
the high schools of Kansas. Thus it has been demonstrated that 
it is possible for as much as 2.7 per cent of the population to be 
enrolled in high schools. In the whole country only 15.6 persons in 
a-thousand are attending high schools—a number considerably below 
the average for the leading State. In South Carolina the correspond- 
ing number is only 5.3 persons. It is seen, therefore, that California 
has over five times as great a proportion of its population getting a 
high-school education as has South Carolina. Similar ratios for 
Arkansas and Mississippi are less than one-fourth of those for Cali- 
fornia or Kansas. Clearly, the States at the bottom of the array 
in figure 19 are not reaching a very large percentage of boys and 
girls of high-school age. The foregoing considerations are subject 
to the following errors: First, it is shown in the chapter on State 
school systems that the true high-school enrollment is 1.175 times 
the number of students represented in this report; second, any 
inacuracies in census estimates for the different States. will be re- 
flected in this chart.

Since 1911 the Bureau of Education has collected statistics show- 
ing the number of high schools offering each curriculum and the 
number of students enrolled in each curriculum. In collecting 
these data, from 1911 to 1916, the schools were asked to report the 
number of students enrolled in each course—academic, commercial, 
etc. In 1918 the meaning of the term “course’’ was defined on the 
blank as “not a single subject of study but subjects organized in 
groups.” The reasons. for making this term more specific arose 
from the fact that in 1915, when enrollment by subjects of study 
was also asked for, considerable ambiguity resulted as to the meaning 
of the terms “subject” and “course.” This lack of uniformity in 
replying is clearly in evidence in figure 20, where the curves have a 
decided “hump” in 1915. The term “course’’ in this schedule has 
always implied a group of subjects organized around some central 
subject, such as agriculture, home economics, etc. The term 
“course’”’ is here used in the sense of a program of studies or a 
curriculum. Practically all of the high schools offer the academic 
course. The number of students taking this course, however, has 
decreased from 80 per cent to almost 70 per cent since 1911. The 
decrease indicates the ascendency of vocational courses. The 
superiority of the “academic” curve over the others indicates that 
our public high schools are still preparing students to meet college 
entrance requirements. In discussing the other curves running 
near the bottom of the figure, the data for the year 1915 must be 
omitted from consideration, since the questionnaire used at that 
time was evidently misconstrued. In general, there has been a 
greater tendency for the schools to offer vocational courses than for 
students to enroll in such courses, since the curves in the first part 
of figure 20 are higher, in general, than the corresponding ones 
representing enrollment. Preceding practice appears to deter 
students from entering the new vocational courses. Possibly the 
failure of certain colleges to recognize for entrance requirement the 
work in vocational courses done in high school prevents boys and girls 
from “taking a chance” with the vocational courses. Among the 
vocational courses the commercial course has led, enrolling almost 
twice as many students each year since 1911 as any other vocational 
course. Relatively few students are pursuing an agricultural or a 
teacher-training course. The manual training and the home eco- 
nomics courses enroll about the same percentage of students. The 
enrollment by course of study in 1918 includes junior high-school 
statistics. As relatively few junior high-school pupils have chosen 
a course of study, the trends are not materially affected by this 
inclusion. The slight drop in the vocational curves in 1918 is

  170 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
The present status of high-school curricula is shown graphically 
in figure 21 for all schools combined and for each type of school. 
The group of bars under the heading “academic’’ shows that rela- 
tively few students are enrolled in academic work in the fully ac- 
credited, in four-year, and in city and village high schools. In the 
lower-grade schools, in the shorter-course schools, and in the rural 
high schools most students take the academic work. Only in the 
rural high schools is there a much greater tendency for girls than 
boys to take academic work. From the “pins” shown in this part 
of the diagram it appears that only a few city high schools have 
ventured to depart from the purely academic work. Practically all 
other types of schools are academic. 
Rather large percentages of fully accredited schools, four-year 
schools, and city high schools offer a course in teacher training. 
Relatively few students in any type of high school enroll in this 
course. Few boys are enrolled in this course. Quite large pér- 
centages of fully accredited, four-year, and city and village high 
schools offer a commercial course. These high schools also enroll 
relatively large percentages of students. A slightly higher per- 
centage of boys than of girls take this course. 
Relatively large percentages of high schools offer courses in 
agriculture, but only a small percentage of students take such 
courses. 
The home economics courses are usually taken by girls and the 
manual training courses by boys. Many of the fully accredited, 
the four-year, the city, and village high schools offer home economics 
courses, but they enroll comparatively small percentages of students 
in such courses. The “pins’’ project considerably beyond the bars 
in this part of the diagram. Relatively speaking, few lower grade 
schools, shorter course schools, and rural high schools offer a course’ 
in home economics, but in such courses fairly large percentages of 
students are registered. The manual training work is confined very 
largely to the fully accredited, the four-year, the city, and the village 
high schools. Few high schools offer trade courses, and correspond- 
ingly few students take these courses. 
GRADUATES. 
From a historical viewpoint it is interesting to note from figure 22 
that the number of high-school graduates has increased from 21,882 
in 1890 to 224,367 in 1918. The increase has been over 925 per cent 
in this period. In other words, we are now turning into our popula- 
tion over 10 times as many high-school graduates as we did a quarter 
of a century ago. Considering the increase in population within 
these 28 years (62,622,250 in 1890 and 105,253,300 in 1918), it is 
found that we are becoming over six times as well educated. The’

number of girls graduating has always exceeded the number of boys. 
of all high-school graduates became teachers and remained in the pro- 
fession for three years each, they would be sufficient in number to 
supply a teacher for every elementary and secondary school in the 
land. 
A better notion, however, may be gained as to the degree to which 
we are becoming an educated nation by noting the bars in figure 23.

  Fig. 22.—Number of high school graduates reported, 1890-1918. (For data see Table 1.) 
The States have been ranked on the percentage of the population 
18 years of age graduating from a four-year high-school course, 
either public or private. From this graph it will be seen that 10.32 
per cent of the population of this age graduate annually. Thus about 
one-tenth of the people in the United States are now receiving the 
benefits of a complete high-school education. That the private 
high school plays an important part in its contribution in certain

States may be noted from the “concreted’’ part of the bars. The 
population 17 years of age might have been used as a basis of com- 
putation, but the results would not be essentially different. Some

  will graduate earlier than the age of 18 and a few later, but the total 
number 17 or the total number 18 years of age should graduate 
annually. The degree to which each State should come up to this 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  174 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
ideal standard is shown in the figure. Thus Vermont ranks first 
and Maine second. Over one-fourth of the youth of Vermont are 
now completing a high-school course. In Maine almost as many, 
23 per cent, reach this standard. In South Carolina only 1.44 per 
cent of its population is now completing a high-school course. In 
Arkansas the corresponding percentage is 2.88. In general the 
Southern States rank low in this respect. Judged from this standard 
the high schools of the country are only 10 per cent efficient. Possibly 
a very few children are not capable of receiving a high-school educa- 
tion, and possibly it would not be wise to give every child a high- 
school education as such now exists—unrelated as it often is to the 
requirements of certain vocations. But as the modern high school 
develops, offering a wide variety of subjects, it should come to make 
its contribution to the special need of every boy and girl who is not 
mentally incapable of receiving it. 
The bars representing the different States in figure 23 are in general 
shorter than they should be for this reason: It is found in the chapter 
on State school systems that the true high-school enrollment is 1.175 
times the enrollment represented in this report. Presumably the 
number of graduates shown in this report from four-year schools is 
correspondingly too small for each State. Any inaccuracies in esti- 
mating the population 18 years of age, due to the unusual shifting. 
about of the population since 1910, will be reflected in this graph.

    MTG BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
GRADUATES GOING TO COLLEGE, 
In 1918 the Bureau of Education asked the high schools to report 
the number of graduates from the graduating class of 1917 who went 
to college or to other institutions, such as business, normal, or pro- 
fessional schools, in 1917-18. While no statistics were collected by 
the Bureau of Education in 1916-17, yet the number of graduates in 
that year can be reliably estimated from the number graduating in 
1916 and in 1918, as shown in Table 49. The summary of these 
computations has been assembled in Table 10 and shown graphi- 
cally in figure 24. From this figure it is evident that the term 
‘college’ may have been misinterpreted by certain principals, since 
it is hardly likely that any graduates of two-year high schools will 
enter college. It should be noted that there were only 3,576 graduates 
from two-year schools in 1918. It is altogether possible that grad- 
uates of three-year, of partially accredited, and of non-accredited 
high schools should be admitted conditionally to collegiate work in 
certain institutions. : 
The bars shown in the diagram admit of a number of comparisons. 
Thus, a greater percentage of boys than girls will go to college from 
any type of high school. On the other hand relatively more girls 
than boys will attend other schools than colleges or universities. 
In only one unimportant instance does this not obtain, viz, among 
graduates of two-year high schools. Evidently the girls must com- 
plete immediately a course in some noncollegiate institution to 
enable them to pursue some vocation. Boys go to college rather 
than to minor institutions. Without doubt most girls who continue 
their education in a noncollegiate school attend a commercial school 
or a teacher-training school. More girls go to college, however, than 
attend these purely vocational schools of minor rank. One very 
astonishing condition disclosed by the graph is that partially accred- 
ited and nonaccredited high schools send almost as large a proportion 
of their graduates to college as do those schools whose work is unques- 
tionably recognized for meeting entrance requirements. Little differ- 
ence exists between the percentage of graduates going to college 
from city, village, or rural high schools. The total percentage of 
rural high-school graduates continuing their education is slightly 
greater than that of city and village high-school graduates. It 
must be concluded, however, from an inspection of the bars in the 
last column of figure 24 that the type of high school exerts very 
little influence on the total percentage of graduates who will continue 
their education in some other form of institution. In this whole 
consideration it should be remembered that the data presented relate 
only to the members of the graduating class in 1917 who continued 
their education the following autumn. Other members of this

class may not resume their schooling for one or two years or even for 
a longer period. The great majority of them, however, will undoubt- 
edly continue their education immediately or thenceforth stay out 
of school. 
At this point it is entirely appropriate to compare the influence 
of public and private high schools in sending their graduates to other 
schools. In private high schools 56.2 per cent of the graduates will 
continue their education, while in public high schools only 42 per cent 
will do so. The corresponding percentage for boys in private high 
schools is 68.1, while that in the public high schools is only 47.1.° For 
girls in private high schools this percentage is 46, while in public high 
schoolsitis 38.7. Private high schools send 39.2 per cent of their gradu- 
ates to college, while the public high schools send only 28 per cent. The 
private schools send 58 per cent of their boy graduates to college, while 
the public schools send only 38.1 per cent. From'these private schools 
24 per cent of the girl graduates go to college, while frem public high 
schools only 21.4 per cent go. The private high schools send 17 per cent 
of their graduates to other schools than colleges, while the public high 
schools send 14 per cent of their graduates to such schools. From 
private high school 10.1 per cent of the boy graduates and 22 per 
cent of the girl graduates go to these vocational schools, while from 
public high schools these respective percentages are 9 and 17.3. It 
is seen, therefore, that private high schools make relatively greater 
contributions to enrollment in higher institutions or in vocational. 
schools than do the public high schools. This condition undoubtedly 
prevails, because the children who can afford financially to attend 
private high schools can also afford to attend a college or a vocational 
school later. 
The percentage of graduates from public high schools going to 
college is shown by States in figure 25. The order of the States 
around the circle is determined by the total percentage of graduates 
going to college. The curve representing this ratio is almost a perfect 
spiral with Texas at one end and Maine at the other. In general the 
Southern States lead and manufacturing States come last. It has 
been shown above that the Southern States have proportionately 
few high-school graduates. It is shown here that a very large pro- 
portion of these few graduates go on to college. On the other hand 
some of the New England States graduate relatively large numbers 
of high-school students but send relatively small percentages to 
college. Maine, Vermont, and Massachusetts are in this class. In 
Texas almost 48 per cent of the high-school graduates go to college; 
in Maine less than 18 per cent go. In every State a greater percent- 
age of boy graduates than girl graduates goes to college. In Mississippi 
and Utah these percentages are nearly equal.

Figure 25 does not tell the whole story about the subsequent edu- 
cation of our high-school graduates. Some of these graduates go to 
business schools, normal schools, trade schools, etc. The percentage 
of graduates going to these vocational noncollegiate institutions is 
shown for each State in figure 26. On this score New Mexico leads 
and Mississippi comes last. In other words, 22.2 per cent of the 
graduates in New Mexico go to noncollegiate schools, while in Missis- 
sippi only 6.8 per cent go to such schools. In every State except

Maryland the percentage of girl graduates going to these vocational 
schools is greater than the percentage of boy graduates. The “boy” 
and the “girl” curves in figures 25 and 26 are reversed. These facts 
would seem to indicate that girls must equip themselves quickly for 
a vocation—the high school itself usually failing to give the desired 
vocational work—and do so by entering a school offering a shorter 
course than that usually given by a college or university. The boys 
want collegiate training. The girl may expect to follow her vocation

for “bigger jobs”’ than the girls. 
It is desirable to combine the curves shown in figures 25 and 26 
to show what percentage of the high-school graduates in each State 
continue their education in some kind of school. In this array ‘of 
States Texas leads, North Carolina comes second, and Kentucky, 
third. Rhode Island, Maine, Connecticut, and Nebraska come last, 
ranking 46th, 47th, 48th, and 49th, respectively. It is highly sig-

nificant that in Texas over 60 per cent of the high-school graduates 
continue their education. This standard has been set by the largest 
State (in area) in the Union. Other States could unquestionably 
attain it. ‘‘Sixty per cent to college” is no longer an ideal, but a 
reality. It should be observed that great differences between boys - 
and girls do not exist in this graph. These curves representing the 
sexes criss-cross considerably. More generally, however, the boys 
excel. The motive for making a living operates about equally with

shown in figures 26 and 27, the boys going to college and the girls to a 
vocational school. The boys are willing to pay the price for recogni-

True, exceptions are found, but the tendency of the curves unmis-

HIGH-SCHOOL PROPERTY. 
Probably no single factor, outside of the teaching staff itself, con- 
tributes more to asuccessful high school than the value of property and 
equipment. The investment measures public interest in the welfare 
of boys and girls. The high-school building is, at once, a monument 
to ignorance and a light-house to progress. The relative importance 
of these beacons in the different States is shown in Tables 78 to 83. 
Figure 28 presents the facts for all high schools reporting them. The 
average value of buildings and grounds is shown at the left; that of 
furniture, apparatus, etc., at the right. As the same schools did not 
always report both facts, the corresponding bars could not be properly 
combined. This figure shows wide differences between the different 
types of schools. The average building of a fully accredited high 
school is worth about $75,000, while that for partially accredited and 
non-accredited schools is less than one-fourth this average. High- 
school buildings of four-year schools are about five times as valuable 
as buildings of three-year high schools. The average value of a city 
high-school building is over $200,000, while the average value of a 
rural high-school building is about $25,000, or less than one-eighth 
the value of a city high-school building. Presumably junior high- 
school buildings are modern and of recent construction, as their aver- 
age value is over $100,000. The average value of all types of high- 
school buildings is over $45,000. 
The fully accredited, the four-year, the city, the village, and the 
junior high schools have relatively greater average values of furniture 
and apparatus than do the other types shown in the diagram. City 
schools are especially fortunate in this respect. In interpreting this 
figure it should be remembered that only 1,049 schools did not report 
the value of high-school buildings and grounds. The averages shown, 
therefore, are especially dependable. 
The average value of all school property per high school for a 
period of years is shown by the continuous heavy curve in figure 29. 
There has been almost a steady increase in this average since 1896. 
At that time the average value of property was about $20,000. In 
1918 the corresponding average was almost $50,000. Within this 
period of 22 years the average value of high-school buildings, grounds, 
and equipment has more than doubled. The increased cost of new 
buildings and equipment has, undoubtedly, caused a part of this 
increased valuation. The curve therefore exaggerates the actual 
progress made. The increase in the value of equipment alone is 
shown for the past 10 years by the ‘‘dotted”’ line in the same figure. 
The increase for this purpose has been about proportional to the 
total increase.

HIGH-SCHOOL LIBRARIES. 
Figure 29 also shows the average number of volumes in high- 
school libraries. The curve representing the average exhibits con- 
siderable irregularity, but the general trend unmistakably denotes 
larger library facilities. ‘This hopeful tendency has been established 
despite the fact that new high schools with practically no libraries 
come into existence annually. This de-averaging factor indicates 
that the large high schools have been unusually active in increasing 
their library facilities.

  Fia. 29.—The average value of high-school property, 1894-1918. 
As these averages conceal a multitude of variations from the usual 
high-school library a better conception of this condition may be 
gained from a study of the library facilities in each State for each 
significant group of high schools. The results of this study are 
exhibited in figure 30. From this graph it will be seen that the 
District of Columbia has the largest libraries. California ranks 
second, and New York third. Maine has the smallest libraries, 
with Delaware just above it. California has over eight times as

curves in figure 30 undoubtedly represent very accurately, therefore, 
the real library facilities of high schools. The average high-school 
library in the United States has 694 volumes. Fully accredited 
high schools average 1,047 volumes; four-year high schools, 825 
volumes; city schools, 1,980 volumes; village high schools, 1,000 
volumes; and rural high schools, only 524 volumes. The “rural” 
curve in figure 30 shows that rural high schools generally are not 
so well equipped with libraries as are the other types of high schools 
represented in this chart. City high schools in certain States have 
fairly large libraries. The States particularly fortunate in this 
respect are the District of Columbia, California, New York, Minne- 
sota, Wisconsin, Colorado, Washington, Utah, Kansas, Idaho, and 
Oregon. At any rate, these States average over 2,000 volumes to 
a city high-school library. The average number of volumes in four- 
year high schools and in fully accredited high schools falls generally 
just above the average line for all high schools.

STATISTICS OF PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 1917-1918. 189 
THE COST OF HIGH-SCHOOL EDUCATION. 
It is desirable to measure the cost of high-school education. To 
ascertain this average and the corresponding one for elementary 
education is the purpose of these few paragraphs. Unfortunately, 
the schedules used in gathering the data which have been summarized, 
herein did not ask for a complete statement of high-school expendi- 
tures, it being thought that the high-school principal would not 
have at hand a complete statement of high-school finances, but 
would know his own salary and official expenses, the salary and 
expenses of his supervisors devoting all or part time to high-school 
subjects, the salary of his teachers, the cost of high-school textbooks, 
and the amount spent for supplies used in instruction. The func- 
‘tions of expense just enumerated are technically known as ‘expenses 
of instruction.’ The other general functions not mentioned are 
treated elaborately in the chapter on State school systems. It 
becomes necessary, therefore, to resort to the State report to supple- 
ment the information summarized in this report. The first of these 
functions, general control, can not be easily divided into elementary 
and secondary school costs. Neither can interest paid on indebted- 
ness. The others can. They are: First, operation of plant, includ- 
ing the wages of janitors, firemen, engineers, etc., and the cost of 
fuel, water, light, power, and janitor’s supplies; second, maintenance 
of plant, including all up-keep or repair costs; third, auxiliary agencies, 
including library, health, recreational, and other miscellaneous activi- 
ties; fourth, fixed charges, including annual fixed expenditures, such 
as rent, insurance, contributions, etc.; and fifth, outlays, including 
cost of new buildings and of grounds and of new equipment. 
In the chapter on State school systems of the Biennial Survey it 
will be found that the following States made a fairly reliable separa- 
tion of expenditures between elementary and secondary schools for 
the functions named above, except for general control and for interest 
on indebtedness: Arizona, California, Connecticut, District of Colum- 
bia, Louisiana, Maine, Utah, Vermont, and West Virginia. The 
expenditures in these States aggregate $76,940,194, or over 10 per 
cent of the corresponding expenditures for the United States 
($763,678,089). These States enroll in school almost 10 per cent of 
all the pupils in the public schools of the country (2,031,878 out of 
20,853,516). Our “‘sample,’’ therefore, represents about one-tenth 
of the Nation. The average length of the school term in these nine 
States is 160.7 days, exactly the same as it is for the United States. 
The States are also located in the East, South, and West. They are 
also distributed at intervals in figures 31, 32, and 33. The total per 
capita cost of education for the United States based on the total 
enrollment is $36.62; for these nine States, $37.86. The correspond-

-P-A-G-E-193
STATISTICS OF PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 1917-1918, 193 
ing per capita for the United States for current expenses only (out- 
lays omitted) is $30.91, for these nine States, $32.56. In the State 
report it is shown that out of each $1 spent for education 3.3 cents 
goes for general control, 58.2 cents for instruction, 15.5 cents for 
outlays, and 23 cents for other miscellaneous purposes. In these 
nine States it is found that a school dollar is distributed as follows: 
For general control, 2.9 cents; for instruction, 62.6 cents; for outlays, 
14.1 cents; and for other purposes, 20.4 cents. As corresponding 
figures in each series of computations are practically equivalent, 
“sample” of States should be fairly dependable. 
Of the $76,940,194 spent for education in these nine States, 
$2,246,207 went for general control and $919,534 for interest on the 
school debt, neither of which can be reliably separated into elemen- 
tary and secondary school costs. The per pupil cost for general 
control and interest in these States, therefore, is $1.56 and is assumed 
to be the same for elementary and secondary school pupils. On the 
other functions of expense it was found necessary in only a few minor 
instances to prorate an amount between elementary and secondary. 
These nine States spent for instruction in the elémentary schools 
$35,714,450 and in secondary schools $12,467,234; for outlays in 
the elementary schools $7,330,484 and in the secondary schools 
$3,452,761 (the total amount spent was prorated in the ratio of 138 
to 65); for operation of the elementary school plant $7,069,241 and 
of the secondary school plant $2,792,243; for maintenance of ele- 
mentary schools $1,717,091 and of secondary schools $385,533; for 
auxiliary agencies in the elementary. schools $1,467,339 and in sec- 
ondary schools $529,726; and for fixed charges incident to elementary 
schools $639,870 and to secondary schools $208,481. Of the 2,031,878 
pupils enrolled in the schools of these States, 1,792,681 were regis- 
tered in elementary schools and 239,197 in secondary schools. 
From these data significant relationships may be computed. Ex- 
cluding the cost of general control and interest on indebtedness the 
total amount spent on the 1,792,681 elementary school pupils was 
$53,938,475, or a per capita of $30.09. With the same exclusions the 
total amount spent on the 239,197 secondary school students was 
$19,835,978, or a per capita of $82.93. If the per pupil cost of gen- 
eral control and interest, viz, $1.56, is added to these per capitas, 
the average cost of elementary education is found to be $31.65 and of 
secondary education $84.49 per year. These aggregate per capitas 
include per pupil costs for outlays amounting to $4.09 and $14.43. 
respectively, which should be deducted if it is desired to secure an 
average expressing the per capita current expenses only. These 
remainders are $27.56 and $70.05, respectively. Thus it is shown 
that %t costs annually 2.67 times as much to keep a high-school student 
in school as it does an elementary-school pupil. It should be remem-

    bered, however, that the elementary-school year is not so long as the 
high-school year. Estimating for Vermont only (using the New 
Hampshire ratios), it is found that the average length of the elemen- 
tary-school term in these 9 States is 158.7 days, while that of the 
high-school term is 176.2 days. The total per pupil cost per day in 
elementary schools is therefore 19.94 cents and in high schools 47.95 
cents, or only 2.40 times as much. It is also found that the average 
annual cost of instruction only for pupils in the elementary schools 
is $19.92, while the corresponding average for secondary-school 
students is $52.12. These averages imply that the quality of instruc- 
tion in high school is 2.62 times as great as that in the elementary 
school. The ratio, therefore, expressing comparative instruction 
costs (2.62) is about equivalent to that expressing total costs (2.67). 
The near-equality of these ratios implies that for other costs than 
instruction costs a difference exists between the elementary and the 
secondary school. In the elementary schools this amounts to only 
$11.73, while in the secondary school it totals $32.37. It is often 
difficult to differentiate between elementary and secondary school 
costs for operation, maintenance, fixed charges, auxiliary agencies, 
and outlays. Considerable guessing and prorating are necessary, 
especially when elementary and secondary schools occupy the same 
building. To ask principals to go into all this detail would have re- 
duced the number of replies and would have made the costs of 
instruction shown in the figures much less reliable, since fewer schools 
would have reported the facts desired. As practically all high schools 
reported the cost on instruction, the deductions made below are 
sound, 
From the foregoing it is found that 61.7 ver cent of all high-school 
costs goes for instruction, while 62.9 per cent of all elementary-school 
costs goes for this purpose. In Tables 90 to 95 the average cost of 
instruction in each type of high school considered is shown. The 
average for all schools is $58.96. This amount represents only 61.7 
per cent of the total cost for all high-school purposes. If this per- 
centage has been accurately established, the total cost per student 
is $95.56, instead of $84.49, as deduced from the reports of 9 State 
superintendents. This difference may be due to several factors: 
First, principals report contractual salaries rather than the amount 
actually paid; second, they may give the entire salaries of super- 
visors who devote only part time to high-school work—business 
agents being more likely to credit such employees to the elementary 
school; third, principals may report under ‘‘supplies used in instruc- 
tion” a variety of expenditures, if they do not heed the technical 
limitation. As these possibilities of error are all on one side, it must 
be concluded that the $84.49 comes more nearly representing the
-P-A-G-E-195
  
STATISTICS OF PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 1917-1918. 195 
average annual cost per student than does the $95.56. The average 
cost of instruction for all high schools ($58.96) is therefore about 
69.78 per cent of the total cost. Consequently, any per capita costs 
appearing in this report represent about seven-tenths of the total 
per capita cost. Since the multiplier is constant, the per capitas 
given in Tables 90 to 95 may be compared directly. Likewise the 
curves in figures 31, 32, and 33 may be compared. 
The curves show that the per capita cost of high-school education 
in fully accredited high schools is less than it is in partially accredited 
schools; in city schools, less than in rural schools; and in four-year 
schools, less than it is in shorter-term schools. Where large schools 
are maintained, per capita costs are relatively low, and vice versa. 
Small, short-term, partially-accredited rural high schools are main- 
tained at high cost. This factor alone does not argue that they are 
better schools than those more fortunately situated and conducted 
at a lower average cost. These conditions prevail in nearly all the 
States, the ‘‘dotted” curve in figures 31 and 32 falling to the left of 
the average for all schools, and the city and village high-school curves 
in figure 33 occupying much the same relative positions. 
The high schools of Nevada, Montana, Arizona, and California are 
maintained at high cost; while those of Vermont, Maine, Alabama, 
Georgia, and the two Carolinas are comparatively inexpensive. In 
5 States the average cost exceeds $75. In 14 States the average is 
less than $50. In each case, of course, these averages represent only 
seven-tenths of the total annual cost of maintaining the high schools.

SALARIES OF PRINCIPALS. 
       
   
    From the data submitted it would have been possible to comput 
the average annual salaries of teachers. This study will appear i 
another bulletin including a study of the qualifications and experienc 
of teachers in the different types of high school. As this specia 
bulletin will not contain anything concerning the salaries of princi- 
pals, the average annual salaries (including expenses) of these ad 
ministrative officers have been shown in Tables 13 and 90 to 95 and in| 
figures 34 and 35. In this study it should be remembered that three- 
fourths of these principals have charge of schools enrolling not over 
100 students. : 
The average high-school principal receives $1,272 per year, or| 
about $100 per month for the entire year. Principals in fully ac- 
credited high schools get on an average $1,557. In four-year schools 
the corresponding average is $1,378. In city high schools the princi- 
pal receives an average salary of $2,431, or over $200 per month. 
Rural high-school principals get only $1,134. Principals in low-grade 
schools and in short-term high schools get relatively low pay. This 
inequality in pay makes it difficult for one of these schools to get 
recognition in the fully accredited group, since so small a salary will 
not attract the best principals. 
Principals in the District of Columbia, California, Arizona, Massa- 
chusetts, and New Jersey receive the highest salaries,in the order 
named. Nebraska pays the lowest average salary. Maine, Michi- 
gan, Indiana, and Iowa, together with several Southern States, also 
pay relatively low salaries to their high-school principals. An in- 
spection of the individual reports reveals the fact that high-school 
principals are poorly paid. Few capable college graduates will con- 
descend to accept such paltry amounts as are sometimes given when 
other more remunerative vocations are open to them. If we wish 
to attract the strongest young men and women to the teaching pro- 
fession, we must amyl competitors. 
EXPENDITURES FOR SITES, BUILDINGS, AND OTHER PERMANENT 
IMPROVEMENTS. 
In Table 84 it is shown that 4,598 schools incurred expenses for 
capital outlays or permanent improvements in 1918. The amount so 
spent aggregates $39,713,848. Similar data have been collected from 
high schools since 1910. In that year, 2,596 schools reported out- 
lays amounting to $19,366,049; in 1912 the corresponding expendi- 
tures by 2,645 schools amounted to $21,530,142; and 3,668 schools 
reported expenditures in 1916 totaling $30,220,656. From these 
comparative figures it does not appear that war conditions interfered 
to any great extent with the high-school building program. From

STATISTICS OF PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS, 1917-1918. 199 
the statistics of State school systems it is found that the following 
amounts were spent for outlays for both elementary and secondary 
schools: In 1910, $69,978,370; in 1912, $78,018,967; in 1914, $91,- 
606,460; in 1916, $103,507,315; and in 1918, $119,082,944. Assum- 
ing that these corresponding reports are correct, the proportion of all 
outlays going for high-school purposes may be ascertained. Thus, 
in 1910, this ratio was 27.7 per cent; in 1912, 28 per cent; in 1914, 23.5 
per cent; in 1916, 29.2 per cent; and in 1918, 33.4 per cent. It is 
seen, therefore, that from one-fourth to one-third of the total amount 
spent in the United States for new buildings, grounds, and new 
equipment goes for high-school purposes. The high percentage is 
significant in view of the fact that only 8.3 per cent of the total 
public-school enrollment is found in high school. In other words, in 
1918 we spent for permanent improvements in our elementary schools 
$79,369,096 for the 19,117,897 children enrolled in such schools, or a 
per capita of only $4.15. For the same purpose in our high-schools 
we spent $39,713,848 for the 1,735,619 children registered in such 
schools, or a per capita of $22.88. These average costs show that 
we spent in 1918 for capital outlays over 5.5 times as much for a high- 
school student as we spent on a child in the elementary schools. Of 
course, some of the high-school buildings are often used to accom- 
modate elementary school pupils, and this fact tends to reduce 
slightly the disproportionate ratio of 5.5. These facts do not imply 
that we are spending too much on high-school buildings, most of 
which have been recently constructed along modern lines, but that 
we are spending too little on our elementary school buildings. The 
rural school child in particular quite often uses an old building which 
was constructed many years ago and which can not usually be called 
modern in any sense of the term.‘

  CHAPTER ITI. 
PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES, 1917-18. 
ContENts.—Schools—Length of course and term—Instructors—Students—A mount of schooling offered— 
Graduates—Military drill—Property—Income—F our-year high schools—Statistical tables. 
SCHOOLS INCLUDED. 
The schools represented in this chapter are either private secondary 
schools or schools ranking higher than secondary schools but not 
offering a four-year collegiate course or not classed as junior colleges. 
Only a very small percentage of them offer any work beyond the 
secondary grades. A large number offer elementary as well as 
secondary work; in fact, the number of elementary pupils exceeds 
the number of secondary students, as will be noted in Table 6. The 
statistics in this chapter, however, relate only to private secondary 
schools unless elementary schools are specifically designated. The 
private secondary schools offering only a commercial course have 
been included in the report on private commercial and business 
schools. About 60 schools, formerly included in this chapter, have 
been transferred to the chapter on commercial schools, thereby 
tending to reduce the list of schools represented herein. No school 
has been included which does not enroll at least 10 secondary 
students. 
NUMBER OF SCHOOLS REPORTING. 
The number of private secondary schools reporting since 1900 
shows considerable variation, as will be noted in figure 1. It is 
doubtful if the total number of such schools in the United States has 
decreased during any interval represented in the graph. There was 
apparently a rapid decrease from 1900 to 1909, but the very abrupt 
rise in the curve after that date seems to indicate that a decreasing 
number of schools submitted a report within this period. Many 
private secondary schools are organized each year, and many go out 
of existence annually. A frequent and thorough revision of the 
mailing list maintained by the Bureau of Education is necessary in 
order to insure comparable returns from year to year. It is evident 
that a thorough revision of the list was made in the years following 
1909. Avslight decrease is shown for 1916, and a decided decrease for 
1918. It is not possible from the inquiries sent out to ascertain how 
many of these private secondary schools were closed on account of 
the war. The greatest number of schools reported in 1915 and the 
309

smallest number in 1909. The total number reporting in 1900 was 
1,978, and the number reporting in 1918 was 2,058. Considering only 
the number of schools reporting in 1900 and 1915 (a period unaffected 
by war conditions), there was an increase of 270 schools, or almost 14 
per cent. 
Prior to 1902 no data were collected as to the number of schools 
open exclusively for boys or for girls, or as to the number which were 
coeducational. The three lower curves in figure 1 show the number 
of schools of each type reporting each year since that date (except in 
1917, when no reports were solicited). In 1902, 53 per cent of the 
schools were coeducational, but in 1918 only 45 per cent were coedu- 
cational. In 1902, the number of girls’ schools was only 29 per cent 
of the total number, but in 1918 they constituted 36 per cent of the 
total. Within the same period the percentage of boys’ schools 
increased only from 18 to 19 per cent. In other words, within the  
-P-A-G-E-313
  PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES, 1917-1918, 313 
last 16 years the percentage of coeducational private high schools and 
academies has decreased 15 per cent; the percentage of such schools 
exclusively for girls has increased 24 per cent; and the percentage 
exclusively for boys has remained practically the same, the increase 
being only a little over 5 per cent. The validity of these percentages 
is based on the assumption that the same relative percentage of each ” 
of the three types of schools in the United States reported in 1902

DENOMINATIONAL AND NONSECTARIAN SCHOOLS. 
A casual inspection of figure 2 reveals the fact that the nonsectarian. 
private high schools and academies have gradually decreased. The 
abrupt rise in the upper curve in figure 1 in the period 1910 to 1915 
is due almost wholly to the increase in the number of denominational

schools reporting. In 1900, over 52 per cent of all private secondary 
schools were nonsectarian, while in 1918 only 28 per cent of such 
schools were nonsectarian. In other words, there are now only sbout 
half as many nonsectarian private secondary schools as there were 18 
years ago, while the number of schools controlled by church organiza- 
tions has increased over 56 per cent. 
A review of the chronological statistics summarized in Table 2 
shows that this increase has been due very largely to the increase in 
the number Roman Catholic schools, and to a much smaller

  extent to the increase in the number of Lutheran schools. Within this 
period the number of Roman Catholic schools has increased from 361 
o 940, and the number of Lutheran schools from 32 to 53. The 
number of Baptist schools also has increased very slightly. All 
other private secondary denominational schools for which statistics 
are available during this entire period show decreases.   SIZE OF SCHOOLS. 
The distribution of private high schools and academies, according 
to the number of secondary students enrolled in each, is shown 
graphically in figure 3. The largest group of schools enrolls fewer than

total number. The next largest group, .enrolling from 51 to 100 
students, includes 611 schools, or almost 30 per cent of the total 
number. Altogether, 467 schools enroll over 100 students. Three 
of these schools enroll over 1,000 students, as indicated by the last

vertical bar in the diagram. Certain detailed statistics of all schools 
enrolling 100 students or more are given in Tables 28 and 29. 
The central tendency with reference to the size of schools may be 
indicated by the arithmetical average, the median, and the mode. 
The average enrollment in all schools reporting is 77 students. 
The median enrollment is 53 students. In other words, as many 
schools have more than 53 students as have fewer than that number. 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
316 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
Half the schools have from 30 students (first quartile) to 94 students 
(third quartile). One-fourth of the schools have fewer than 30 
students, and another one-fourth have more than 94 students. More 
schools enroll 40 students than any other single number (mode). 
PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTION OF STUDENTS. 
From figure 4 it is possible to ascertain the percentage of students 
in any given percentage of schools and vice versa. For example, 20 
per cent of the schools enroll 50 per cent of the students, and 50 per 
cent of the schools enroll almost 80 per cent of the students. Con- 
versely, 20 per cent of the students are enrolled in about 5 per cent 
of the schools, etc. If the enrollment in each school were the same, 
the ‘‘curve of actual distribution’? would follow the ‘‘line of equal 
distribution.” The bowing of the curve of actual distribution away 
from the line of equal distribution indicates the degree of inequality 
in the distribution of students.

Figure 5 shows the distribution of private high schools and acade- 
mies according to the length of course offered and according to the 
length of the term in days. Over 85 per cent of the schools offer a 
four-year course; over 7 per cent, a three-year course; almost 4 per 
cent, a two-year course; and 3.5 per cent, a one-year course. The 
number of schools offering a four-year course is almost six times as 
great as the combined number offering a one, twe, or three year course.

    Less than 10 per cent of the four-year schools have a term of 160 
days, or fewer. Over 40 per cent of these schools have a term 
exceeding 180 days. About half of them have a term of 161 to 180 
days. Similar computations can be made for one, two, and three- 
year schools.

If the four groups of schools having one, two, three, and four year

This curve is practically unaffected by the variation in the number 
of schools reporting, since a representative sample was secured each 
year. 
The average size of faculty has increased from 5.1 in 1900 to 6.9 
in 1918. When the number of schools reporting was small, 1905 to 
1909 (see fig. 1), the average size of faculty was comparatively large,

varying from 6.1 to 6.7. This condition indicates that the larger 
schools continued to report from 1900 to 1909, while the smaller 
schools kept dropping off and new ones were not added. It appears, 
therefore, that the list of schools, from which reports were sought

STUDENTS. 
The total number of students reported in 1918 was 158,745, includ- 
ing 86,507 girls and 72,238 boys. The total is a small increase over 
the enrollment in 1916. Within this two-year period the number of 
girls increased from 81,920 to 86,507, while the number of boys 
decreased from 73,215 to 72,238. The “total” eurve in figure 8 takes 
the same general trend as the number of schools reporting, shown 
graphically in figure 1. The highest enrollment reported was for 
the year 1918, while the greatest number of schools reported in 1915. 
The divergence of the two curves for girls and for boys since 1909 
indicates that the proportion of girls in private secondary schools 
has increased more rapidly than the number of boys. Until 1909 
the number of boys was about equal to the number of girls. In 1918 
54.5 per cent of the students were girls. Undoubtedly the propor-
-P-A-G-E-321

tionally greater increase in the number of girls is due to the fact 
that the number of private secondary schools exclusively for girls

exclusively for boys, as shown in figure 1. How much of this increase 
in the number of girls enrolled is due to an increase in a greater pro- 
portion of additional reports received from girls’ schools than from 
boys’ schools since 1909 can not be ascertained.

ELEMENTARY PUPILS. 
Of the 2,058 schools reporting, 1,517 reported pupils in elementary 
grades. The total number of such pupils, 207,525, includes 87,495 
boys and 120,030 girls. In 1916 only 89,679 elementary pupils were 
reported, including 37,311 boys and 52,368 girls. This difference 
is accounted for by the fact that a large number of elementary pupils 
in private schools in years preceding 1918 were rejected from the 
tabulation. ; 
ENROLLMENT IN BOYS’ SCHOOLS, GIRLS’ SCHOOLS, AND COEDUCA- 
TIONAL SCHOOLS, 
  It was shown in figure 1 that the number of coeducational schools 
reporting exceeded the number of girls’ schools, and that the number 
of girls’ schools exceeded the number of boys’ schools each year 
since 1900. The same relationship exists among the number of 
students reported by these three types of schools as shown in figure 9. 
One exception to the comparison occurs, viz, in 1909, when the 
enrollment in boys’ schools exceeded the enrollment in girls’ schools. 
In 1918 44.7 per cent of the students were enrolled in coeducational 
schools; 28.4 per cent, in girls’ schools; and 26.9 per cent, in boys’ 
schools. In 1915, 44.3 per cent of the students were enrolled in 
coeducational schools; 30.1 per cent, in girls’ schools; and 25.6 per 
cent in boys’ schools. It is evident, therefore, that the percentage 
of students enrolled in girls’ schools has decreased slightly within 
the last three years. The increased enrollment in boys’ schools in 
1918 is probably due to the demand for military training, which is 
usually given in schools exclusively for boys. The decrease in the 
number of students enrolled in girls’ schools is partly caused by the 
transfer of 60 private secondary schools offering only a commercial 
course to the chapter on private commercial schools, since the enroll- 
ment in such schools in 1918 consisted chiefly of girls. 
In 1900, 55.6 per cent of the students were enrolled in coeduca- 
tional schools; 24 per cent in girls’ schools; and 20.4 per cent in 
boys’ schools. Comparing these percentages with the corresponding 
percentages above for 1918, it is found that there has been a notice- 
able decrease in the proportion of students enrolled in coeducational 
schools within this period of 18 years, and an increase in the propor- 
tion of students enrolled in schools open exclusively to boys and to 
girls. It appears, therefore, that private secondary schools are becom- 
ing more and more noncoeducational. 
ENROLLMENT BY YEARS AND THE NUMBER GRADUATING. 
The relationship of the curves in figure 10 is significant. From 
them it is possible to compare the enrollment in any year of the 
course with the enrollment in any other year of the course by noting

PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES, 1917-1918, 325 
the relative distances of the curves from the base line. In 1918 the 
enrollment in the third year is about equal to the enrollment in the 
fourth year, both curves on this year being about equidistant from 
the zero line. The enrollment in the first year in 1918 is proportion- 
ally greater than that in preceding years, probably accounted for by 
the fact that unclassified students are tabulated in the first year 
and by the fact that a greater number of special students were 
enrolled in private secondary schools, especially in military schools, 
during the period of the war than in preceding years. The number 
graduating is less than the number in the fourth year and the relative 
distances between these two curves is becoming greater year after 
year. It should be added in this connection that the curve repre- 
senting the number of graduates has in it two compensating errors. 
Schools which: offer a course extending a year or two beyond the 
usual secondary course will report fewer graduates than they would 
have reported if their course ended at the completion of the twelfth 
grade. This factor tends to reduce the number of students complet- 
ing the secondary course and at the same time to increase the enroll- 
ment in the fourth year, since all collegiate students in these schools - 
are classed as fourth-year students in the tabulation. Schools which 
offer only a one, two, or three year course often report graduates 
which are included with the graduates from four-year schools. This 
factor tends to increase the number of graduates and to decrease the 
enrollment in the fourth year from what it would be if all schools 
offered a four-year course. As these factors counteract each other, 
the relative positions of the curves in figure 10 are essentially correct. 
The greatest inaccuracy is found in the enrollment in the first year, 
since it includes all special and unclassified students. 
In Table 3 the percentage of students enrolled in each year of the 
course since 1907 is shown. For example, 34.9 per cent of the 
students in 1912 were enrolled in the first year, 26.8 per cent in the 
second year, 20.9 per cent in the third year, and 17.4 per cent in the 
fourth year. Since 1907, when these data were first collected, the 
proportion of students enrolled in each year of the course has not 
changed materially.. In the first year there has been an increase 
from 33.1 per cent in 1907 to 36.6 per cent in 1918; in the second 
year a slight decrease, from 26.5 per cent to 25.7 per cent; in the 
third year a more pronounced decrease, from 22.4 per cent to 19.5 
per cent; and in the fourth year a slight increase, from 18 per cent 
to 18.2 per cent. These slight proportional changes are not readily 
apparent from the figure. 
A comparison between the curves in figure 10 indicates fairly accu- 
rately the school mortality. The enrollment in the first year in 1907 
becomes the enrollment in the second year in 1908, the enrollment in 
the third year in 1909, and the enrollment in the fourth year in 1910.  
-P-A-G-E-326
  326 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
  The enrollment of 21,856 in the first year in 1907 reduces to 17,674 
in the fourth year in 1910. The mortality within these secondary 
schools is therefore 4,182, or 19.1 per cent for students entering in 
1907. This percentage does not include the number enrolled in the 
fourth year who fail to graduate. If these are included the mortality 
increases to 7,447, or to 34.1 per cent. 
It is desirable to secure a series of stable percentages showing the 
mortality of students as they advance in the course from the first to 
the second year, from the second to the third, from the third to the 
fourth, and from the fourth year to graduation. To ascertain these 
percentages the progress of a single class through school would not 
give a dependable ratio; it would be subject to variation with different 
classes entering the private secondary schools in different years. 
A more stable group of ratios, unaffected by variable reports, may be 
computed by securing the average enrollment for a period of con- 
secutive years for the number of students in each year of the course 
and by ascertaining the mortality percentages between these averages. 
It is necessary to observe that the average enrollment in any class 
(first year, second year, etc.) lags one year behind the average enroll- 
ment in the class next above it. The averages must be computed, there- 
fore, for different consecutive periods as follows: The average enroll- 
ment in the first year from 1907 to 1915 was 39,187; in the second 
year from 1908 to 1916, 32,887; in the third year from 1909 to 1917, 
26,672; and in the fourth year from 1910 to 1918, 24,833. The aver- 
age number graduating from 1910 to 1918 was 19,638. The loss 
between the first average and the second is 6,300, or 16.1 per cent of 
the number in the first year; between the second and the third is 
6,215, or 18.9 per cent of the number in the second year; between the 
third and fourth is 1,839, or 6.9 per cent of the number in the third 
year; and between the average fourth-year enrollment and the 
average number of graduates is 5,195, or 20.9 per cent of the number 
in the fourth year. The total loss between the first-year average 
enrollment and the fourth is 14,354, or 36.7 per cent, and between the 
first-year average and the average number who graduate is 19,549, 
or almost 50 per cent. In other words, only four-fifths of the students 
enrolled in the fourth year graduate and only half of those who enter 
privato secondary schools graduate. 
Considering the average enrollment in the uxst year (39,187) as 
the base, it is found that 16.1 per cent of this number will not enter 
the second year, an additional 15.9 per cent will not enter the third 
year, an additional 4.7 per cent will not enter the fourth year, and 
an additional 13.3 per cent of those who do enroll the fourth year 
will not graduate. Care should be taken not to confuse these mortal- 
ity percentages, viz, 16.1, 15.9, 4.7, and 13.3, with the percentages 
given above, viz, 16.1, 18.9, 6.9, and 20.9, which are computed respec-
-P-A-G-E-327
PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES, 1917-1918, 827 
tively on the average enrollments for the first, second, third, and 
fourth years of the course. The former series when added give the 
total mortality of 50 per cent, while the latter series can not be 
accumulated. 
The methods suggested above for estimating school mortality are 
only approximate. Students attending schools offering a course 
shorter than four years often have no opportunity to continue their 
school work after they have completed the course offered. These 
students are counted, by the methods employed above, as among 
those who drop out of school. Possibly they may complete the 
secondary course in a public high school. Students who transfer 
from a private high school to other types of schools not represented 
in this chapter have been considered among those dropping out of 
school. On the other hand, pupils completing a public high school 
offering a short course may enter private secondary schools. Also 
some transfer from public to private secondary schools. It is assumed 
that these two factors compensate for each other, or are of minor im- 
portance. Since all appreciable errors likely to occur are compen- 
sating, it is held that the mortality percentages given above are 
essentially correct. 
If there were no school mortality, the four curves representmg 
enrollment would fall nearer together, and the enrollment in any 
class in any year would be equal to the enrollment in the class below 
it for the year just preceding. A line joining these hypothetical 
points representing the enrollment of the same class for four con- 
secutive years would run parallel to the base line. The negative 
slope or declination of any line joining the actual enrollment points 
representing the same class in different years indicates approximately 
the mortality rate. If there is no mortality, such lines will run 
parallel to the zero line. The greater the incline the greater the 
mortality. For example, the line joining the point 21,856 in 1907 
with 21,403 in 1908 is not so precipitous as the line joining the latter 
point with the point 18,086 in 1909. The mortality between the 
second and the third year is greater, therefore, than that between : 
the first and the second year for the class entering in 1907. Caution 
should be used in employing this method of comparing mortality 
rates since the same declination on widely different parts of the 
scale does not give close approximations. 
STUDENTS IN DENOMINATIONAL AND NONSECTARIAN SCHOOLS. 
An inspection of figure 11 shows that the enrollment in denomi- 
national schools has exceeded the enrollment in nonsectarian schools 
since 1900. The increase in enrollment since 1909 has been almost 
wholly due to students in denominational schools. (The enrollment 
in nonsectarian schools since 1900 has decreased from 57,173 to  
-P-A-G-E-328
  
328 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
50,721, while the enrollment in denominational schools has increased 
from 53,624 to 108,024, or has more than doubled. An inspection 
of Table 2 shows that the increase in enrollment in denominational 
schools has been due almost wholly to the increasing number of 
students in Roman Catholic schools. The Baptist, Episcopal, and 
Lutheran schools show slight gains for this 18-year period. The 
curves in figure 11 are very similar in outline to those in figure 2, 
which represent the number of schools reporting.

STUDENTS TO A SCHOOL. 
The average number of students in private high schools and acade- 
mies has increased from 56 in 1900 to 77.1 in 1918, or an increase of 
37.7 per cent. A marked increase in the size of schools occurred be- 
tween 1916 and 1918, when the average was raised from 70.5 to 77.1. 
The relatively high averages occurring from 1903 to 1909 are proba- 
bly due to the fact that the larger schools continued to report while a 
number of the smaller schools did not report or were discontinued as 
has been explained elsewhere. It is doubtful, therefore, if these 
high averages (1903-1909) are consistent with the averages for other 
years.

  The distribution of students as to sex and color is shown graphi- 
cally in figure 18. The number of colored students enrolled in pri-

total, but in schools for colored youth the number of boys equals only 
33.9 per cent of the total. It is evident therefore from figure 13 that

private secondary schools for colored students do not enroll as large 
a percentage of boys as is characteristic of private schools for white 
students. 
COLORED STUDENTS. 
Figure 14 shows over a series of years the distribution of colored 
students in private secondary schools as to sex. The number of col- 
ored girls has exceeded the number of colored boys each year since 
1900, except in 1903. Until 1911 the boys and girls were about

equally divided. Since that date the two lower curves diverge, 
indicating that there is a tendency for these private schools to enroll a 
much larger percentage of girls than boys. The total number of 
colored students enrolled has increased from 2,390 in 1900 to 9,107 
in 1918, or 253 percent. This percentage is significant in view of the 
fact that the corresponding increase in the number of white students 3152

PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOLS EXCLUSIVELY FOR COLORED STUDENTS. 
The statistics of private high schools exclusively for colored youth 
are shown in detail in Table 29 and in summarized form in Tables 26 
and 27. Altogether, 133 schools of this type reported. Of these 
schools, 105 offer a four-year course. The total number of instruc- 
tors was 780 and the total number of students 9,032. Of this num- 
ber, 7,885 students are enrolled in four-year schools. An additional 
number of 75 colored students were enrolled in other private sec- 
ondary schools. The total number of graduates reported was 1,189. 
The total number of colored students in military drill was 850. The  
-P-A-G-E-332

distribution of enrollment by course of study is shown in Table 26. 
The total number of volumes in the libraries of these schools was 
122,765, and the total valuation of all property was $6,036,849. In 
all, 129 schools reported a total income of $999,765.

dents (58,143) are in the first year; about one-fourth (40,751) are in 
the second year; almost one-fifth (31,016) are in the third year; and 
18.2 per cent (28,835) are in the fourth year. The horizontal scale 
shows the distribution of boys and girls in each year of the course. 
A very striking feature of this sex distribution is that the percentage 
of boys and girls remains about the same as students advance in the 
course. Some force must operate in private secondary schools to 
keep the boys in school. The number of girls, however, constitutes 
over half the total enrollment in each year.

while 7.1 per cent of the schools offer a three-year course, they enroll 
only 3.2 per cent of the students; while 3.8 per cent of the schools 
offer a two-year course, they enroll only 1.6 per cent of the students; 
and while 3.5 per cent of the schools offer a one-year course, they 
register 5.1 per cent of the students. It is evident, therefore, that the 
larger schools offer a four-year or one-year course. The exact average 
size of schools in each class may be obtained by dividing the number 
of students in each group of schools by the corresponding number of
-P-A-G-E-334

schools. The average size of the four-year schools is 81; of the three- 
year schools, 35; of the two-year schools, 32; and of the one-year 
schools, 111. 
The horizontal scale of figure 16 shows the percentage distribution 
of students according to the length of the school term. A very small 
percentage of students in four-year schools have a term of 140 days 
or fewer, as indicated by that part of the diagram colored black.

    Fic. 17.—Rate of increase in the number of students in private high schools and academies as compared 
with that in the total population 5 to 18 years, 1900-1918. (‘The average enrollment since 1900 is 121,215. 
The enrollment for each year since 1900 is divided by this average to get the index numbers for students. 
The similar method used in securing the population indices is given in detail in the chapter on “Indus- 
trial Schools for Delinquents.’ The ‘moving average” is secured by averaging the indices for seven 
consecutive years and plotting the average for the fourth year of the series. The moving average shows 
the general trend.) 
180 days. Over one-fourth have a term of 181 to 200 days. Combin- 
ing the last two groups, it is found that about one-third of the students 
in four-year schools have a term exceeding 180 days. For all schools 
combined, it is found that 1.8 per cent of the students have a term of 
140 days or fewer; that 7.8 per cent have a term of 141 to 160 days; 
that 47.7 per cent have a term of 161 to 180 days; that 27.7 per cent 
have a term of 181 to 200 days; and that 15 per cent have a term 
exceeding 200 days. The corresponding percentages appearing on
-P-A-G-E-335
PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES, 1917-1918, 835 
the graph should be compared with these percentages for all types 
combined. Thus the percentage of students in three-year schools 
haying a term of 161 to 180 days (28.5 per cent) is not nearly so large 
as the corresponding percentage (47.7 percent) for all groups combined. 
The students in one-year schools have either a very short term (20.6 
per cent of the students) or a very long term (38.1 per cent of the 
students.) 
COMPARATIVE RATES OF INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SECONDARY 
STUDENTS IN PRIVATE SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND IN THE TOTAL 
POPULATION 5 TO 18 YEARS. 
By reducing the population 5 to 18 years and the enrollment in 
private secondary schools to index numbers, it is possible to compare 
rates of increase. The method used in securing the indices is to 
divide the population each year by the average population for the 
period 1900-1918, and to divide the enrollment each year by the 
average enrollment for the same period. The respective curves are 
then plotted according to the indices appearing at the top of the figure. 
The population curve shows a fairly steady increase, but the enroll- 
ment curve takes the same general course as that representing the 
total enrollment in figure 8. The sudden fluctuations in this curve 
have been eliminated by applying a moving average to the index 
numbers for enrollment, as explained above. The rate of increase 
between any two consecutive years is indicated approximately by the 
slope of the curve joining these points. Thus from 1914 to 1915 the 
population curve has about the same slope as the moving average, 
indicating that rates of increase are about equal. Since 1914 the 
enrollment and the population have also increased at about the same 
rate. If the extremities of the two curves are compared, it is found 
that the moving average has increased a little more rapidly than the 
population curve. The drop in the enrollment curve from 1900 to 
1909 has been explained elsewhere. This part of the enrollment curve 
and the corresponding moving average should not be compared with 
the population indices. It would have been impossible to compare 
graphically the absolute enrollment with the total population 5 to 18 
years without reducing the actual numbers to indices. Any relation- 
ship existing would have been imperceptible, since the totals would 
have occupied widely different parts of the scale. 
NUMBER OF GRADUATES. 
A distribution of graduates according to sex is shown graphically 
in figure 18. Until 1909 the number of boys graduating was about the 
same as the number of girls. Since that date the number of girls 
graduating has increased more rapidly than the number of boys, as 
indicated by the divergence of the two lower curves in the figure.

   336 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
There was a slight decrease in the number of boys graduating in 1918. 
This is probably accounted for by war conditions, many of the older 
boys probably coming within the draft age or leaving school to accept 
positions made vacant by draftees. The number of girls graduating 
continued to increase regardless of war conditions. 
GRADUATES GOING TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING,    In 1916, and in years preceding, data were collected to show the 
number of graduates from private secondary schools who were pre- 
paring to enter college or other institutions of learning. The replies 
to this question did not show how many graduates actually went 
to higher institutions. In 1918 the inquiry was changed so as to 
secure the actual number who go to other schools after graduation 
from the private secondary school. At the time these reports are 
furnished, just after the close of the school term, graduates have 
not yet entered college or other institutions. Consequently, prin- 
cipals were asked to give the number of graduates from the class 
of 1917 who went to college or to other institutions of learning in 
1719-18. The replies, therefore, to this inquiry are not directly com-

338 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
  parable to the number graduating in 1918. Since the Bureau of 
Education collects statistics only for even-numbered years, the exact 
number of graduates in 1917 is not known. It can be estimated, 
however, from the number graduating in 1916 and 1918. In 1916 
the total number of graduates was 22,991, including 10,768 boys 
and 12,223 girls. In 1918 the total number of graduates was 23,832, 
including 10,218 boys and 13,614 girls. The average of these respect- 
ive numbers gives approximately the number of graduates in 1917, 
viz, total, 23,412; boys, 10,493; and girls, 12,919. It is found from 
Table 11 that the total number of graduates (class 1917) who went 
to college in 1917-18 was 9,186, including 6,091 boys and 3,095 
girls, and that the total number who went to other institutions, 
such as normal schools, business schools, trade schools, etc., was 
3,981, including 1,056 boys and 2,925 girls. Assuming that the 
estimates made above are correct, it is found that 39.2 per cent of 
the graduates in 1917 went to college in 1917-18 and that an additional 
17 per cent went to other schools, making a total of 56.2 per cent 
who continued their education after graduating from the private 
secondary school. These percentages are not essentially different 
from those shown in Table 11, columns 11 and 15, which are based 
on the number graduating in 1918. 
It is of special interest to compare the percentages of boys and 
girls graduating from private secondary schools who go to other 
institutions of learning. Of the 10,493 boys graduating in 1917, 
58 per cent went to college in 1917-18 and an additional 10.1 per 
cent went to other schools. Altogether, 68.1 per cent’ of the boys 
continued their education after completing the work of the private 
secondary school. Of the 12,919 girls graduating in 1917, 24 per cent 
went to college in 1917-18 and an additional 22 per cent went to 
other schools. Altogether, only 46 per cent of the girls graduating 
in 1917 continued their education after completing the secondary 
school. By comparing the percentages of boys and girls going to 
college it is found that 2.4 times as great a proportion of boys as girls, 
graduating from the private secondary school, will attend college, 
while almost 2.2 times as great a proportion of girls as boys will go 
to other schools. The great influx of girls to private commercial 
schools during the war, shown elsewhere in this report, may partly 
account for the large percentage of girls graduating from private 
secondary schools who go to other schools not of collegiate rank. 
The small percentage of boys enrolled in normal schools and private 
commercial schools indicates that teaching, bookkeeping, steno- 
graphic and secretarial work, etc., are not so attractive to boys as 
to girls. Consequently, boys go to colleges and universities, while 
a proportionally large percentage of girls go to other schools, such 
~ as normal schools, business schools, ete.

PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES, 1917-1918, 339 
It has been estimated above that 50 per cent of the students enter- 
ing private secondary schools do not remain to graduate. It has 
just been shown that only 56.2 per cent of those graduating con- 
tinue their education in other institutions. There is an additional 
loss, therefore, of 43.8 per cent after graduation from the secondary 
school... Of 100 students entering private secondary schools, only 
50 will graduate and only 28 or a little over one-fourth the original 
number will enter college or other educational institutions. Con- 
sidering only the graduates going to college, it is found that only 
20 students out of the 100 entering the secondary school will enter 
college four years later. In other words, four-fifths of the students 
entering high school will not enter college. 
NUMBER OF SCHOOLS REPORTING THE VARIOUS COURSES OF STUDY. 
It will be observed in figure 20 that practically all schools (2,019) 
offer the academic course. Until 1918 all schools were considered 
as offering an academic course. The number of schools offering a 
commercial course has increased from 614 in 1911 to 872 in 1918. 
The number of schools offering a course in home economics has 
increased from 186 in 1911 to 411 in 1918. The high point in the 
curve in 1915, viz, 511, is probably an error. The number of schools 
offering a teachers’ training course has remained practically the same, 
increasing only from 259 in 1911 to 281 in 1918. The number of 
schools offering a course in agriculture has increased from 100 to 152 
within the same period, and the number offering a technical or manual 
training course from 102 to 194.1. The number of studentsenrolled 
in each course for each year since 1910 is given in Table 3. Onlya 
small percentage of students in private secondary schools are enrolled 
in these special courses, outside of the commercial. Only a small 
percentage of schools offer a course in manual training, in home 
economics, in agriculture, or in teacher training. The private high 
schools are largely academic. 
STUDENTS IN MILITARY DRILL. 
As will be noted in Table 1, no data were collectedfrom 1907 to 1913, 
inclusive, from private secondary schools concerning the number of 
students in military drill. Since 1913 the enrollment in this subject 
has increased. In 1914, 86 schools reported 6,835 students in this 
subject; in 1915, 113 schools reported 8,836 students; in 1916, 134 
schools reported 10,324 students; and in 1918, 532 schools reported 
31,532 students in military drill. Within the last two years the num- 
ber of schools offering military drill has increased almost four-fold 
  
1 As shown in Table 13, 118 schools offer trade training courses in which 3,834 students are enrolled, 
including 1,875 boys and 1,959 girls. The purely trade training schools, public and private, will be 
treated in another chapter.

By reference to Table 9 it will be noted that 65 schools offer military

girls were reported as being enrolled in military drill. The boys 
taking military drill number 28,893 and are enrolled in 474 schools. 
About one-fourth of the private secondary schools offer military drill 
and about one-fifth of all secondary students in all private secondary

schools are enrolled in this work. The effect of the war in stimulat- 
ing private secondary schools to offer military training is clearly 
evident. * 
LIBRARIES, 
The average number of volumes in the libraries of private high 
schools and academies has increased from 1,264 volumes in 1900 to 
2,122 volumes in 1918. The relatively high averages from 1904 to 
1909 are probably due to the fact that only the larger schools reported 
during this period. The data for 1904 are probably erroneous.

PROPERTY, 
By reference to Table 23 it will be found that 1,680 schools reported 
grounds and buildings valued at $176,897,467. If each of the other 
schools had the same average valuation ($105,296), the aggregate 
for all 2,058 schools would be $216,699,168. It should be remem- 
bered that the property is used by both elementary and secondary 
pupils, d . 
Altogether, 1,638 schools reported the value of scientific apparatus, 
furniture, machinery, libraries, etc., amounting to $15,568,693. If 
each school not reporting this information had the same average 
valuation ($9,505), the total valuation of such property in the 2,058 
schools would be $19,561,290. - 
Only 336 schools reported endowment funds, aggregating 
$34,179,242. 
In all, 788 schools reported expenditures for sites and buildings 
during the year amounting to $5,052,289. 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
  INCOME. 
As shown in Table 24, only 168 private secondary schools received 
money from public appropriations. The total amount ‘thus appro- 
priated was $441,463. 
The total amount received from tuition and other educational 
fees was $13,662,413, as reported by 1,393 schools. The total amount 
received from productive funds was $1,945,781, as reported by 331 
schools. The number of schools reporting this information agrees 
fairly well with the number reporting the value of productive endow- 
ment funds, viz, 336 schools. Assuming that the $1,945,781 is the 
income on the total amount of productive funds, $34,179,242, the 
rate of interest received is 5.69 per cent. 
Altogether, 977 schools reported an income from“ other sources” 
amounting to $6,602,372. The total income available for use was 
$22,652,029. The total number of schools reporting income was 
1,761. These schools enrolled 126,720 students. The average in- 
come per secondary student, therefore, was $179, as shown in Table 25. 
This average should be used with care, since the income reported 
includes receipts for both the elementary and the secondary school. 
The income from tuition fees per secondary student was $108, as 
shown in Table 25. Pupils in the elementary grades contribute also 
to this tuition fund of $13,662,413. The total per capita income of 
$179 and the per capita income of $108 from student fees, while not 
strictly accurate, in that elementary pupils are not considered, are 
probably equally erroneous. The ratio between them, 60 per cent, 
indicates the extent to which student fees support private secondary 
schools. ; 
Altogether, 186 schools received endowment funds amounting to 
$1,748,258. FOUR-YEAR HIGH SCHOOLS. 
For several reasons it is desirable to show separately the statistics 
of four-year private secondary schools. Of the 2,058 schools report- 
ing, 1,760 offer a course of at least four years. Of the 14,199 instruc- 
tors in private secondary schools, 13,011, or over 91 per cent, are 
employed in four-year schools. These four-year schools enroll 
143,027 secondary students, or 90.1 per cent of the total number of 
students reported. In 1918, of the 23,832 graduates reported, 
21,256, or 89.2 per cent, were graduates of four-year schools. Strictly 
speaking, these are the only graduates who are eligible to attend 
college. The number of graduates from these four-year schools is 
73.7 per cent of the enrollment in the fourth year. In other words, 
26.3 per cent of students in the fourth year of four-year schools fail 
to graduate. As pointed out elsewhere, the fourth-year enrollment 
often includes students registered in grades beyond the secondary 
school. This condition tends to increase the graduation mortality
-P-A-G-E-343
PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES, 1917-1918, 3438 
  percentage (26.3 per cent) above what it really should be. It is 
impossible to compute mortality percentages between the enrollment 
of one year and another in four-year schools, since statistics of such 
schools have not been segregated in preceding reports. 
If the total number of graduates reported for all schools (23,832) 
is divided by the total number of students in the fourth year (28,835), 
a quotient of 82.6 per cent is obtained. This quotient, indicating a 
loss of only 17.4 per cent, is erroneous, since one-year, two-year, and 
three-year schools also report graduates but have no fourth-year 
enrollment. The method used in connection with a discussion of 
figure 10, in estimating mortality between.the fourth year and gradu- 
ation, is likewise probably erroneous to the same degree, since a similar 
method has been used in ascertaining it. Expressed mathematically, 
17.4 per cent is to 26.3 per cent as 20.9 per cent is to an unknown 
quantity, which is found to be 31.6 percent. This result means that 
31.6 per cent of students enrolled in the fourth year of private second- 
ary schools, from 1910 to 1918, did not graduate, aloss of almost one- 
third instead of one-fifth (20.9 per cent) as computed above. Both 
percentages, however, have value, the one showing the graduation 
mortality for all schools combined and the other for four-year schools 
only. The decrease in graduation mortality from 31.6 per cent for a 
nine-year period to 26.3 per cent in 1918 is very commendable. 
From the 1917 class 8,378 graduates of four-year schools went to 
college and an additional 3,647 graduates went to other institutions. 
Assuming that the same number of graduates from the class of 1918 
will continue their education in 1918-19, it is found that 39.4 per cent 
will attend college and 17.2 per cent will go to other schools. In 
other words, 56.6 per cent of the graduates of four-year schools will 
continue their education. 
Of 100 students registered in the fourth year of four-year schools, 
only 74 will graduate and only 42 will enter college or other institu- 
tions of learning. A high mortality rate is, therefore, shown between 
the last year in high schools and the first year in college. 
By reference to Table 22 it is found that 32.4 per cent of the 
students enrolled in four-year schools are in the first year, 26.6 per 
cent in the second year, 20.8 per cent in the third year, and 20.2 per 
cent in the fourth year. The corresponding percentage distribution 
of enrollment for all private secondary schools is 36.6, 25.7, 19.5, and 
18.2 per cent for these respective years. Since the first percentage 
in the latter group (36.6) includes unclassified and special students, 
the first percentage in the former group (32.4) comes more nearly 
representing the correct percentage in the first year. Since the last 
percentage in the former group includes students enrolled beyond 
secondary grades, the latter percentage comes more nearly represent- 
ing the correct percentage enrolled in the fourth year of the secondary 
school. For all schools combined the following distribution percent-
-P-A-G-E-344
844 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
ages are estimated to be essentially correct: First year, 34 per cent; 
second year, 27 per cent; third year, 21 per cent; and fourth year, 
18 per cent; the fourth year including all students in these schools 
doing collegiate work.

BIENNIAL STATISTICS. 
Throughout the following report it will be observed that no his- 
torical statistics are given for the school year 1916-17. After the 
statistical report for the scholastic year 1915-16 had been compiled 
the Bureau of Education adopted the plan of collecting statistical 
reports biennially instead of annually as had been done the preceding 
years. The changes in the totals of corresponding items for consecu- 
tive years are very slight, and for most purposes biennial statistics 
will suffice. 
SCHOOLS INCLUDED. 
In corresponding preceding reports certain statistics of commercial 
departments of public high schools have been included in the chapter 
on private commercial and business schools. This year this chapter 
will be published before the high-school reports will have been 
tabulated. A report on the larger commercial departments in 
public and private high schools will appear in the chapter on ‘High 
Schools” in the Biennial Survey. Statistics on commercial depart- 
ments in colleges and universities will be found in the chapter on 
“Colleges, universities, and professional schools” of the Biennial 
Survey. CLASSIFICATION OF SCHOOLS. 
This chapter contains statistics of two types of schools hitherto 
tabulated together in alphabetical order: First, the purely private 
commercial and business schools not connected or affiliated with any 
religious organization and, second, the Y. M. C. A. commercial 
departments and schools conducted by religious organizations. In 
the following pages the two types will be referred to for convenience 
as nondenominational and denominational schools, although it is 
well understood that the Y. M. C. A. schools are not ‘denomina- 
tional” in the usual sense. The statistics of these two types of 
schools are so unlike that it is thought advisable to separate them 
and to make summary tables for each group. The historical graphs 
and the graphs on shorthand systems taught, as used herein, embrace 
both types of schools, while the graphs showing ‘‘students per 
387 
   
-P-A-G-E-388
388 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
  instructor,” and “hours per day,” and showing tuition rates include 
only nondenominational commercial schools. This classification, 
therefore, separates the schools which are conducted on a purely 
commercial basis from those having a religious or denominational 
trend and warrants certain deductions concerning the former which 
would be more or less vitiated if the latter had not been placed in a 
separate tabulation. : GRADUATES, 
So unsatisfactory have been the returns designating the number of 
graduates that this inquiry was omitted from the statistical schedule 
for 1917-18. A large number of commercial school students leave 
school before they have finished the prescribed course or just as soon 
as they can qualify for a position. In many schools students are 
permitted to leave at any time and no regular graduation exercises 
are held. Consequently, it is difficult for commercial schools to keep 
accurate records on the number of graduates. Further, graduation 
from a 3-months’ course is not equivalent to graduation from a 
12-months’ course, and the total number of graduates is without 
special significance.

NUMBER OF SCHOOLS REPORTING. 
This year a slight decrease is shown in the number of private com- 
mercial and business schools reporting. In 1916, reports were re- 
ceived from 912 schools, while in 1918 only 890 schools submitted 
reports which could be used. This decrease may be due to the dis- 
continuation of a number of smaller schools on account of war con-

PRIVATE COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS, 1917-1918, 3889 
ditions, but many schools this year either refused to report or sub- 
mitted an inconsistent report which could not be included in the 
detailed tabulations. The Bureau of Education maintains a mailing 
list of private commercial and business schools which contains 1,329 
schools, as indicated in columns 2 and 11 of Table 7. This list has 
been revised annually, and probably includes a large percentage of 
such schools in the United States. It can be seen, therefore, that 
this chapter is not a complete presentation of private commercial 
school statistics, but it is representative in that it contains 67 per 
cent of all schools listed.

390 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
The increase in the number of commercial schools reporting each 
year since 1900 is shown in Table 1 and in figure 1. A decided in- 
crease is shown since 1912. Previous to this date a certain irregu- 
larity in the curve exists, an abrupt rise being evident in 1901 and 
1902 and a falling off in 1906 and 1907. Presumably in the past 
few years a more thorough method has been used in procuring reports 
- than was used in the years immediately preceding, or possibly there 
has been a growing interest on the part of private commercial schools 
in submitting reports. The general rise in the curve can not be 
attributed wholly to these two factors, but chiefly to the rapid 
multiplication of schools of this type throughout the country.

SIZE OF SCHOOLS. 
By reference to figure 2 it will be noted that many schools are very 
small, 248 having an enrollment of less than 100 for the year, and 
227 having an enrollment of from 100 to 199, inclusive. Only three 
schools have an enrollment exceeding 2,500. The median enroll- 
ment of the 890 schools falls between 186 and 187. This means 
that 445 schools have an enrollment of 187 or over and 445 schools 
have an enrollment of 186 or less. The median, therefore, falls in 
the second bar in figure 2 in the group having an enrollment of be-
-P-A-G-E-391
PRIVATE COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS, 1917-1918, 391 
tween 100 and 199, inclusive. If the enrollment in all schools is 
arranged in order of magnitude, and the array is divided into four 
nearly equal groups of 222, 223, 222, and 223 schools, respectively, 
it is found that the first group contains schools having an enroll- 
ment of 90 students or fewer; the second an enrollment of from 90 to 
186; the third an enrollment of between 187 and 400; and the highest 
group, an enrollment of 400 and over. In other words, half the 
commercial schools have an enrollment of between 90 and 400, inclu- 
sive. The average enrollment is 325 students.

—————_ CURVE OF ACTUAL DrsTRIBUTION. _ — — — LIME OF RQUAL DISTRIBUTION. 
  Fig. 3,—Distribution of students in private commercial schools, 1917-18. 
The curve in figure 3 enables the reader to determine readily the 
percentage of students in any desired percentage of schools, or vice 
versa. Reading from the vertical scale, one will observe that 60 
per cent of the students are enrolled in about 22 per cent of the schools, 
and 90 per cent of the students in about 59 per cent of the schools. 
Reading from the base line, one may’ see that 50 per cent of the 
schools enroll 85.5 per cent of the students, and 30 per cent of the  
-P-A-G-E-392
392 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
schools enroll 70.4 per cent of the students. If the enrollment were 
equally distributed in all schools, the curve would follow the ‘line 
of equal distribution” in such a way that 50 per cent of the schools 
would enroll 50 per cent of the students, and 70 per cent of the 
students would be enrolled in 70 per cent of the schools. The ‘‘bow- 
ing” of the curve away from the line of equal distribution indicates 
the degree of inequality in the distribution, or, in technical terms, 
the dispersion in the distribution. The further the curve recedes 
from the line of equal distribution the greater the dispersion. The 
nearer the curve comes to the vertical and horizontal axes of the 
graph, the nearer the maximum dispersion is reached. For a large 
group of measures the two axes represent for all practical purposes 
the greatest inequality possible between the largest and the smallest 
schools.

posed alternately of 44 and 45 schools, the total not admitting of an

45 next largest schools, etc. Approximately 5 per cent of the schools

ENROLLMENT. 
By reference to figure 4 of Table 1 it will be observed that a decided 
increase in enrollment has taken place since 1916. This increase of 
97,191 students, or over 50 per cent, has not been due to an increase 
in the number of schools reporting, since it has been shown above 
that there was an actual decrease of 22 schools reporting. Assuming 
that there are 1,329 private commercial schools in the United States, 
one can readily see that the 912 schools reporting in 1916 and the 
890 reporting in 1918 constitute fair samples of the total number. 
It is unlikely, also, that larger schools reported in 1918 than did in 
1916. The increase of 50 per cent in enrollment within the past two 
years has undoubtedly been due to war demands. The call for 
clerks, stenographers, bookkeepers, and telegraph operators has
-P-A-G-E-394
  894 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
caused many students to enter private commercial schools where the 
necessary training could be secured in the shortest time. 
This conclusion is further warranted by the fact that the large: 
increment in enrollment is due wholly to the increase in the number 
of women students. It will be noted that there has been a decrease 
of 2,685, or 27 per cent, in the number of men students enrolled and 
an increase of 99,876, or 107 per cent, in the number of women 
students enrolled. In other words, the enrollment of women students 
has more than doubled within the past two years. From the graph 
it will be observed that there has been a more rapid increase since 
1900 in the number of women than in the number of men. The rate 
of increase, while gradual, does not become pronounced until 1918. 
The figures warrant, therefore, the further conclusion that an increas- 
ingly larger number of women than men are attending private com- 
mercial schools. The demand for stenographers, the large percentage

  Fia.5.—Students and average attendance in day and night courses in private commercial schools, 1900-1918, 
of whom are women, may account for the rapid rise in the curve 
representing the enrollment of women. Eliminating from considera- 
tion the abnormal statistics for 1918, it is found that from 1900 to 
1916 the number of women enrolled shows an increase of 60,101, or 
181 per cent, while the number of men enrolled shows an increase of 
 
-P-A-G-E-395
  PRIVATE COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS, 1917-1918. 395 
only 40,738, or 70 per cent. All this indicates a shifting in the 
personnel of the student body. The slight irregularities in the curves 
are undoubtedly due to the fact that the Bureau of Education must 
depend entirely upon the good will of the presidents of commercial 
schools to submit a report, and consequently at no time do the statis- 
tics present the whole situation. 
ENROLLMENT IN DAY AND IN NIGHT COURSES. 
This year 716 private commercial schools reported night courses. 
This means that over 80 per cent of such schools maintained night 
courses. It is of interest to note the very rapid rise in enrollment 
in night courses as depicted in figure 5. The increase has been very 
pronounced since 1912, and especially so within the past two years. 
In the day courses there has been a corresponding increase for the 
same periods, but the rate of increase has not been so great. This 
fact can not be readily determined from the graph, but is very 
apparent in figure 6, in which the enrollment for each year has been 
reduced to index numbers.

tively. By means of these index numbers the two curves are 
brought nearer each other in such a way that comparisons showing 
the rates of increase may be made. The relative steepness of the 
slopes of the two curves between any two consecutive points indi- 
cates the tate of change. Thus between 1916 and 1918 the curve 
for the night school enrollment shows a steeper slope than the curve 
for the day schools. Consequently a more rapid change in night 
school enrollment within this period has taken place.

THE MOVING AVERAGE OF INDEX NUMBERS. 
In both curves certain irregularities will be observed. Undoubt- 
edly these low points are due more to the failure of commercial 
schools to submit reports than to any other factor. If all schools 
had reported each year presumably a more gradual rise would have 
appeared in the curves. To eliminate these fluctuations in the 
index curves, moving averages have been applied. The method 
employed in securing the points used in locating these moving 
averages is shown in Table 3. For example, to secure the point
-P-A-G-E-397
PRIVATE COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS, 1917-1918. 397 
for the day school moving average in 1910 the corresponding index 
numbers for 1908 to 1912, inclusive, are added. In other words, 
111, 100, 90, 103, and 91 are added to give the corresponding total 
for 1910 in column 6. This total of 495 is divided by 5, since 5 
consecutive numbers have been used in securing it. The quotient, 
99, is placed in column 8 and is used in locating the moving average 
for the day school in 1910. In a similar manner the other points 
are determined. It is necessary in computing the first two and the 
last two points in the series to repeat the index numbers at each 
end a sufficient number of times to secure the interval of 5 years. 
The two points on each curve at either end may be fictitious, there- 
fore, since the data beyond the limits of the period under con- 
sideration have not been or could not be secured. It is assumed 
that the terminal numbers are repeated. By reference again to 
figure 6, it will be noted that the moving averages have only slight 
fluctuations and that the one for the night school rises more rapidly 
throughout the period under discussion than does the moving average 
for the day school. This means that the enrollment in night schools 
is increasing much more rapidly than enrollment in day schools. 
In fact, the enrollment in night schools since 1900 has increased 
560 per cent, while the enrollment in day schools has increased only 
157 per cent. Without doubt these percentages would not have 
been so large had not the war demands for commercial school gradu- 
ates been so great. 
AVERAGE ATTENDANCE IN DAY AND NIGHT SCHOOLS. 
In figure 5 it is difficult to ascertain whether the per cent of average 
attendance is greater in day or night schools. To answer this ques- 
tion the per‘cent of average attendance for each year since 1905 
has been computed for both day and night schools and the results 
inserted in Table 1. By reference to this table it will be found that 
the average attendance in the day schools varies from 40 per cent 
in 1906 to 47 per cent in 1914. Since the latter date a gradual 
decrease is shown. These percentages are significant, yet likely 
to be misconstrued. They do noéf mean that each student attends 
only 47 per cent of the time while he is in school. Of course, absence 
while in attendance cuts down the percentage, but it is doubtful 
if such absence amounts to as much as 10 per cent. On the other 
hand, these small percentages mean that in the “average” private 
commercial school the time required to complete the course is very 
short, even less than 6 months. Assuming that the capacity of an 
“average”? commercial school is 200 students and an average attend- 
ance of 200 is reported and the total enrollment for the year is 400, 
evidently the “turnover” in the school during the year is 100 per 
cent. In other words, the student body must change once during
-P-A-G-E-398
    398 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
the year. Consequently the “‘average’”’ student would remain only 
6 months in the institution. Allowing for absence while students 
are actually enrolled, the percentages given in Table 1 would un- 
doubtedly be less than 50 per cent, and consequently the ‘‘average”’ 
student in private commercial schools does not remain longer than 
6 months. The fact that some students are enrolled for a part 
of two consecutive years does not modify this conclusion, since 
consecutive reports show approximately the same percentages of 
“turnover” and since ‘leftovers’ will be counted both in enroll- 
ment and average attendance. It is true that some students enter 
commercial schools but do not complete the course. This tendency 
makes the “turnover” greater than if all should remain to graduate. 
A sufficient allowance has probably already been made to com- 
pensate for withdrawals. A casual glance at columns 22, 23, and 
25 in Table 20 will convince the reader that this conclusion is sound. 
An inspection of the graphs herein on tuition rates for all courses 
except the combined will reveal a central tendency in the bars 
representing 34 to 6 months or 63 to 9 months. These will be dis- 
cussed later in this chapter. It is gratifying to note that in general 
there was a gradual increase in the percentage of average attendance 
from 1905 to 1914. After this date a decrease is evident.

In night schools no pronounced tendency is evident in the per- 
centages of attendance given in Table 1. In 1918 the percentage is 
smaller than it has been since 1906. Few schools reported the time 
required for graduation from the night course; consequently, these 
items have not been tabulated in this report. From a casual 
inspection of the reports submitted, it appears that it takes about 
twice as long to complete the night course as the day course. There- 
fore, the percentages given for the night course in Table 1 show the 
“turnover” but afford no index as to the average time required to 
complete the night course. 
ENROLLMENT BY COURSE OF STUDY. 
It will be observed in figure 7 that a decided increase in the number 
of students enrolled in stenographic courses is shown in 1918. The 
number increased from 70,554 in 1916 to 152,402 in 1918, or 116 per

cent. This abnormal increase has presumably been caused by the 
demand for stenographers on account of the war. The enrollment 
in the combined course which includes a study of shorthand also
-P-A-G-E-400
400 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
shows a gradual rise since 1910, but no very pronounced increase is 
evident in 1918. Evidently the demand for stenographers in 1918 
was so insistent that few students would resist it long enough to 
complete both a stenographic and a bookkeeping course. The book- 
keeping or commercial course shows in general a decrease fron 1902 
to 1912, and a gradual increase since that time. This course evidently 
did not receive a very great impetus on account of war conditions. 
The bookkeeping course in 1900 apparently was more popular than 
the other courses offered in private commercial schools. It con- 
tinued to lead until 1911. Since 1911 the stenographic course has 
been decidedly the most popular. . 
Since the curves in figure 7 are so far apart, it is difficult to compare 
the increases in enrollment in the various courses offered. For 
example, was the increase in enrollment in the course in telegraphy 
(wire), from 1916 to 1918, proportionally as great as the correspond- 
increase in the combined or in the bookkeeping course? To answer 
such questions the enrollments given in figure 7 have been reduced 
to index numbers which are plotted in figure 8. From this graph 
it will be noted that the slope of the curve for the course in telegraphy 
(wire) is steeper between 1916 and 1918 than either of the curves for 
the bookkeeping or the combined course. The relative rate of 
increase has, therefore, been greater. However, for the same interval 
the curve for the stenographic course is steeper even than that for 
the course in telegraphy (wire). In the rate of increase in enroll- 
ment, therefore, between 1916 and 1918, the stenographic ranks first; 
the telegraphic, second; the combined, third; and the bookkeeping, 
fourth. Similar comparisons might be made between any other two. 
consecutive intervals. It must be borne in mind that the relative 
positions of the curves do not indicate rates of increase. Only the 
slope or steepness of the curves shows the rate of increase. For 
example, between 1916 and 1918 the curve for the combined course 
stands above the ‘‘telegraphic”’ curve, but the latter shows the greater 
increase during this period. By means of index curves inconspicuous 
fluctuations in original curves running near the base of the graph are 
magnified in such a way as to make them comparable with the 
corresponding fluctuations in the original curves more centrally 
located in the graph of the absolute data. In other words, index 
curves facilitate comparisons which could not be made from the 
original graph.

1 Obtained by dividing enrollment for each year by the average enrollment. 2 Estimated. 
The method used in computing the index numbers used in figure 8 
is shown in Table 4. The enrollment for each year is divided by 
the average enrollment in each course since 1900. The quotients 
obtained in this way are called ‘‘index’’ numbers and are used in 
locating the curves in the “index” graph. This method of showing 
rates of change has come into general use. 
: INSTRUCTORS. 
As would naturally be anticipated, the curve representing the 
teaching staff as shown in figure 9 takes roughly the same general 
trend as the curve representing the student body shown in a previous 
graph. After 1912 a rapid rise isevident in each. In 1918, however, 
the increase in enrollment is much more pronounced than the increase 
in the teaching force, the former being approximately 50 per cent 
and the latter only 14 per cent. These percentages would indicate 
that private commercial schools in 1918 had an unusually large 
number of students enrolled, to each instructor employed. Evi- 
dently the teaching staff had a heavy ‘“‘load” in 1917-18. 
Another similarity exists between the ‘“‘enrollment”’ curves and the 
“imstructor’’ curves, viz, the curve representing the women gradually 
approaches the one representing the men, the former crossing the 
latter in the interval 1916 to 1918, in both curves. This condition 
59872°—21—_26  
-P-A-G-E-402
  402 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
means that a larger and larger percentage of instructors in private 
commercial schools are women. Undoubtedly the curves would not 
have crossed in 1918 had not the war called so many men into the 
Army. However, it is evident that there is a decided tendency for

them to interchange positions, and unless some unforeseen counter- 
acting influence appears they may retain in the future the relative 
positions now occupied. The slight exception to this tendency in 
1915 and 1916 may be due to incomplete reports. Barring from con- 
sideration the unusual statistics for 1918, it is significant that there 
has been an increase of 184 per cent in the number of women teachers 
since 1900, but an increase of only 84 per cent in the number of men 
teachers. 
AVERAGE NUMBER OF STUDENTS PER INSTRUCTOR. 
In order to show the number of students per instructor in private 
commercial schools the data given in figure 10 have been computed 
and arranged. The total number of students enrolled during the 
_year was not used in ascertaining this distribution as the total enroll- 
ment for the year is usually more than twice the number actually 
present each day. To ascertain a fair average for the distribution, 
the average daily attendance in each school reporting such attendance 
was divided by the total number of instructors in corresponding
-P-A-G-E-403
  
PRIVATE COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS, 1917-1918. 403 
schools. The quotients obtained were then arranged as shown in the 
figure. The result is what is known as a ‘‘skewed’’ distribution; 
that is, there are more measures on the right than on the left of the 
central tendency. The most common number of students to each 
instructor is from 16 to 20, inclusive. In all, 143 schools have this 
“load.” Almost an equal number of schools (138) fall in the next 
higher group with a load varying from 21 to 25, inclusive. It is of 
interest to note that 476 schools, or 69 per cent of the total number 
of 690 schools reporting the data used in the construction of this 
distribution table, have from 11 to 30 students per instructor. While

no attempt has been made to ascertain the exact range of the ‘‘mid- 
dle half” of the distribution, it may be safely said the four bars 
included between the limits 11 and 30, inclusive, represent the 
“safety zone.” Schools having a load of 10 or fewer students per 
instructor, or more than 30, may be in ‘‘danger zones.” Possibly 
in certain types of commercial schools it may not be discreditable to 
fall in the extremes of the distribution. It may be added, however, 
that this graph does not include Y. M. C. A. schools, in which the 
enrollment per instructor is usually very large, nor denominational 
schools, in which the load is very small. Only purely nondenomina- 
 
-P-A-G-E-404
  404 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
  tional private commercial and business schools have been used in 
the construction of the curve. 
Several private commercial schools refused to report this year on 
the ground that other commercial schools exaggerated their enroll- 
ment in submitting a report. The skewed distribution shown in 
this graph seems to uphold the criticism offered by the few schools 
declining to report. If several schools reported an exaggerated 
attendance but the actual number of instructors, an asymmetrical 
distribution would result such as that shown in the bar diagram. 
At any rate, the lack of symmetry shows that there is a larger number 
of schools reporting an unusually large average number of students 
‘to an instructor than a small one. It may be added, further, that it 
is doubtful whether the most efficient instruction can be given when 
the average exceeds 45 students to an instructor. 
It should be noted that the number of students per instructor 
is not the same as the average size of classes. If a school had 400 
students in attendance each day and 20 instructors employed, each 
teacher would be charged with instructing an equivalent of 20 students 
daily in all subjects pursued by them. If each student had 5 recita- 
tions daily and each instructor 4 classes the size of each class would 
be 25. 
The average daily attendance used in compiling this graph in- 
cludes the average attendance in both day and night classes. Pos- 
sibly some teachers give instruction to students in both kinds of 
classes. If such condition exists in any school, the fact still re- 
mains that the load for the instructors is the same as represented 
above. It would be advantageous for each school to ascertain its 
own location in the graph from the statistics incorporated in the fol- 
lowing detailed tables. If it falls in the “danger zone” it should be 
able to justify its position both to the instructors employed and to 
the students taught. 
LENGTH OF DAILY SESSION. 
From figure 11 it will be noted that the most common length of 
the daily session is 5 hours or more, but less than 6 hours. A total 
of 355 schools fall in this group. The next group, almost as large, 
consisting of 253 schools, maintains a daily session of 6 hours or 
more, but less than 7 hours. Out of the 751 nondenominational 
private commercial and business schools reporting the length of the 
daily session, 608 hold a session of 5 or 6 hours. In other words, 81 
per cent of such schools fall within the two long bars in the graph. 
The lack of symmetry of this distribution—not so pronounced, how- 
ever, as that shown for the teaching load in the preceding graph— 
may partly nullify the assumption that a few schools reported an 
exaggerated enroliment, since with a heavy load teachers might be

HOURS PER DAY. 
  Fig. 11,—Length of the daily session in 751 private commercial schools, 1917-18. 
This graph does not inciude the length of daily session in the night 
school. By reference to the detailed tables at the end of this chapter 
it will be observed that night classes are usually held for 2 or 24 
hours. In the schedule used in collecting information for this report 
no attempt was made to ascertain whether the students were obliged 
to remain for the entire day session, it being assumed that schools 
generally require attendance for the entire day. The assumption 
evidently is erroneous for schools holding a daily session of 8 hours 
or more. 
TUITION FEES. 
In the following pages an attempt has been made to study the 
tuition rates charged by private commercial schools. These rates 
vary with the nature of the course taken, and higher rates are charged 
for day than for night courses. Again, some schools charge a tuition 
rate by the month, and others require payment for the entire course. 
In most schools the student may pay either by the month or purchase 
   
-P-A-G-E-406
    . 
406 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
ascholarship good for the entire course. In general, the cost of taking 
a course and paying by the month is greater than the cost of a scholar- 
ship, unless the student completes the course in a much shorter time 
than is ordinarily required. The data on which the following graphs 
are based are all tabulated in Table 20. This study of tuition rates 
does not include rates charged in Y. M. C. A. and denominational 
schools. In the following figures the integral number of dollars 
includes also any fractional part of the integer as well. Thus $9 
includes $9 up to $9.99. 
TUITION FEES IN THE DAY COURSE PER MONTH. 
As will be noted from figure 12, the usual charge by the month for 
tuition for either the stenographic, the bookkeeping, the combined, 
or the telegraphic (wire) course varies from $9 to $16. The charge 
is usually $10, $12, or $15. A comparativeiy small number of schools 
charge a monthly tuition rate of $13, or $14, or fraction thereof, as

indicated in the figure. Any school charging tuition rates desig- 
nated by the two groups of bars on the extreme right of the graph 
must either offer a very high grade of instruction, maintain very 
long daiiy sessions, or else charge an unusually high rate of tuition. 
Conversely, schoois charging only $5 to $8, inclusive, either offer an

inexpensive grade of instruction, maintain very short daily sessions, 
or charge unduly low tuition rates. This graph probably represents 
accurately the tuition rates charged by private commercial schools,: 
since in it are given the tuition rates charged by 612 schools offering 
the commercial course, by 636 schools offering the stenographic 
course, by 458 schools offering the combined courses, and by 35 schools 
teaching wire telegraphy. It wouid be difficult, indeed, to assemble 
a more representative list of schools than has been included in this 
graph. 
TUITION FEES IN THE NIGHT COURSE PER MONTH. 
It will be observed in figure 13 that the usual tuition rates charged 
for the night course are lower than the corresponding rates for the 
day course, as shown in the preceding figure. In no case does the 
rate for the night course exceed $10 per.month. The usual charge 
is $5, as shown in the graph. About half as many schools charge $6, 
or some fraction thereof, and a still smaller group charge only $4.

  Fig. 13.—Tuition fee per month in the night course in private commercial schools, 1917-18. 
A number of schools charge $7 to $10 for each course. It is of interest 
to note that the longest biack bar, cross-hatched bar, and single- 
hatched bar, which represent the commercial, stenographic, and 
combined courses, respectively, fall in the same group of bars, viz, 
in the $5 group. One must conclude, therefore, that in general the 
 
-P-A-G-E-408
  408 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
same monthly charge is made for each of these three courses. The 
same conclusion might be made for the “telegraphic” bars, but as 
only 28 schools offer a night course in wire telegraphy, any deduc- 
tion made might be subject to question. Any school charging 
tuition rates of $3, $7, $8, $9, or $10 falls in a ‘‘danger zone’’ in 
the graph. 
TUITION RATES FOR ENTIRE DAY COURSES. 
  It was found more difficult to show graphically the tuition rates 
charged students for the entire course in the day school than it was 
to show the rate by the month, since the time required to complete 
the entire course varies in different schools and with the course 
pursued. For example, in one school it takes 12 months to complete 
the stenographic course, while in another it takes only 3 months, 
Evidently the former school will make the higher charge for tuition. 
To evade difficulties like these, the schools offering each course were 
divided into 5 groups. Group 1 includes all schools in which it was 
estimated that the course could be completed in 3 months or less; 
group 2, from 34 to 6 months, inclusive; group 3, from 64 to 9 months; 
group 4, from 94 to 12 months; and group 5, from 12} to 15 months. 
This grouping has not been done arbitrarily, as the schools seem to 
fall readily into this classification. For example, many schools 
estimate that 6 months are necessary for the completion of the 
course, others 6 to 8 months or 6 to 9 months. Where two limiting 
numbers have been reported, the average of the two has been used 
in locating the school in the graph. It will be noticed in the figures 
which follow that the majority of the schools fall in groups 2 and 3, 
the former group including the larger number for the commercial, 
the stenographic, and the telegraphic (wire) courses, and the latter 
leading in the combined course, as would naturally be anticipated. 
These facts verify the deduction drawn above that the average time 
required to complete a course in a private commercial school does not 
exceed 6 months. In this connection it must be remembered that a 
school does not always fall in the same group in each graph. A 
school might fall in group 3 when the tuition charge for the entire 
stenographic course is considered, but in group 5 when the charge 
for the combined course is considered. 
TUITION RATES FOR THE ENTIRE COMMERCIAL OR BOOKKEEPING DAY 
COURSE. 
A remarkable symmetry is evident in figure 14 in groups 2 and 8, 
showing that almost as large a proportion of schools charge a fuition 
rate in excess of the usual charge as charge a lower rate. A slight 
irregularity toward the right of the graph, in group 3, is apparent.

If lines were drawn joining the tops of corresponding bars, two 
almost perfect curves would be seen, each possessing remarkable 
symmetry. The slight rise at the right in the curve for group 3 
shows that a few schools charge unusually high rates. The curve 
is slightly skewed in this direction. The highest curve represents 
the number of schools which offer a course requiring from 3} to 6 . 
months for completion and charge the tuition rates inserted just 
below the base line. This means that the largest number of schools 
(217) are included in group 2, and that the most customary charge 
for the entire bookkeeping course, covering a period from 3} to 6 
months, is from $60 to $69, inclusive. Schools charging higher or 
lower rates can not justify their charge on the ground that they 
offer a longer or a shorter course. In a similar way it is evident 
that the most usual charge made for this course by schools offering

a course covering a period from 64 to 9 months, inclusive, is from 
$70 to $79, inclusive. No central tendency is evident for schools 
falling in either groups 1, 4, or 5. The small number of schools 
in each group, viz, 11, 44, and 7, respectively, does not justify any 
deductions. It is evident, however, that several schools charge 
unusually high rates; 11 schools charging $130 or more for the 
course.
-P-A-G-E-410
          410 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918,     Altogether, 454 schools reported i tuition rate charged for the 
commercial or bookkeeping course. Of this number, 217 schools, 
or 48 per cent, offer a course extending from 34 to 6 months; and 85 
of these, or 39 per cent, charge a fee ranging from $60 to $69. Again, 
175 schools, or 39 per cent of the total number reporting, maintain a 
6} to 9 months’ course; and 48 of these, or 27 per cent, charge a fee 
of $70 to $79. Only 44 schools, or less than 10 per cent of the total 
number, offer a 94 to 12 months’ course, and the charge for tuition 
in most instances is over $100.

in this graph have almost the same number of schools charging lower

the group. In the 3} to 6 months’ group the most common rate is $60 
to $69, 88 schools charging this fee. In all, 64 schools charge a lower 
and 70 schools a higher rate than this. In the 64 to 9 months’ 
group 49 schools charge a tuition fee of from $70 to $79. Altogether, 
in this group 53 schools charge a lower and 95 a higher rate than this. 
Greater variation from the central tendency is shown in this group 
than in group 2. . In other words, the distribution is slightly skewed 
 
-P-A-G-E-411
    
  PRIVATE COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS, 1917-1918. 411 
in the direction of higher tuition rates. Any school falling in this 
group and charging $110 or more for the course should be able to 
justify its action. The single-hatched bars representing’ group 4 
in this graph show the same irregularity as the corresponding bars 
did in the next preceding graph. Likewise, groups 1 and 5 are 
small and consequently show no marked central tendency. 
Altogether the tuition rates for the stenographic course in 463 
schools are represented in this figure. Of this total, 222 schools, 
or 48 per cent, offer courses requiring from 34 to 6 months for com- 
pletion; and 197 schools, or 43 per cent, offer courses requiring from 
64 to 9 months for completion. In other words, 91 per cent of the 
schools represented in this graph fall in these two groups. This 
tendency to centralize around a 6 months’ course further supports 
the statement made above that the ‘‘average’’ graduate from a 
private commercial schoql has had only six months of training. 
TUITION RATES FOR THE ENTIRE COMBINED DAY COURSE. 
As it takes about twice as long to complete the combined course 
as either the bookkeeping or the stenographic course, a higher scholar- 
ship fee is necessarily charged. In figure 16 it will be observed that

no schools undertake to give this course in three months or less, 
consequently, group 1 is not represented. There are relatively 
fewer schools in groups 2 and 3 than in the two graphs next preceding. 
The majority of the schools are found in group 4; that is they require
-P-A-G-E-412
412 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
from 94 to 12 months for the completion of the course. Altogether, 
321 schools reported the scholarship fee charged for the combined 
course. Of this number, 172 schools, or 54 per cent, fall in group 4. 
The customary fee charged students in schools of this type for this 
course is from $100 to $139, inclusive. Only 30 schools charge a 
higher rate, while 33 charge a lower rate. In the schools in group 5, 
that is in schools offering a course requiring from 124 to 15 months 
for completion, the largest group of schools charge from $140 to 
$149. Two other groups almost as large, consisting of 12 schools 
each, charge $100 to $119 and $120 to $139, respectively. It will 
be noticed that remarkable symmetry is evident for the single- 
hatched, double-hatched, and black bars. A tendency for a few 
schools to charge an unusually high fee is shown in the isolated bars 
at the right. 
In addition to the schools listed in figure 16, 12 schools offer a 
combined course extending from 16 to 42 months and charge tuition 
fees varying from $60 in one school to $270 in another. Only 3 
schools have a course longer than 18 months, and 5 offer an 18 
months’ course. The usual charge for the course ranges from $110 
to $180. 
  TUITION FEE CHARGED FOR THE ENTIRE DAY COURSE IN WIRE 
TELEGRAPHY. 
As will be noted in figure 17, only 25 schools reported the scholar- 
ship fee charged for the entire day course in wire telegraphy. No 
schools appear in groups 1, 4, or 5. In all, 19 schools offer a course 
requiring from 34 to 6 months to complete it, and 6 schools give a

$50 to $59; 7 schools, $60 to $69; 8 schools, $70 to $79; and 1 school, 
$120 to $129. The most usual fee is from $60 to $79. The fee 
charged for the longer courses varies from $50 to $130 and over, no 
* central tendency or customary fee being evident. 
TUITION FEES CHARGED FOR OTHER COURSES. 
By reference to detailed Tables 14, 15, 16, and 17, the tuition fees 
charged by individual schools for courses in wireless telegraphy, 
accountancy, secretarial course, and course in salesmanship, respec- 
tively, will be found. Since these groups are small, nothing would 
be gained by presenting the data graphically. In these tables the 
tuition fee charged is shown for both day and night courses by the 
month and for the entire day course. The number of months usually 
required for completing the entire day course is given in these respec- 
tive tables. A casual inspection of these detailed tables shows that 
there is no customary charge for the entire day course and no usual 
time required for completing it. In fact, these courses have not 
become generally standardized, and time required for completing 
them may be either long or short and the tuition rate low, high, or 
even exorbitant. Frequently no data have been submitted. 
SHORTHAND SYSTEMS TAUGHT. 
On the schedule used in collecting data for this report the following 
question was asked, ‘‘What systems of shorthand do you teach?” 
On, the blank the schools also reported the total number of students 
taking the stenographic course. From the replies to these two ques- 
tions and from the published tabulation of the replies to the first 
question in 1916, Table 5 has been made and the following graphs 
have been constructed and conclusions drawn therefrom. Table 5 
represents a mass of data which is very difficult to comprehend 
without the use of the graphic presentations following. 
In 1918, 53 different systems of shorthand were reported. Four- 
teen systems which were reported in 1916 were not reported in 1918, 
and 11 new systems were reported in 1918. It may be added that 
this study of shorthand systems taught includes all schools reporting, 
both nondenominational and denominational. 
As it is impossible to ascertain from the blank used in collecting 
the data just how many students are taking each system of shorthand 
in all schools reporting it is thought advisable to consider in the fol- 
lowing pages the schools teaching one system only as well as those 
teaching one or more systems. From the one-system schools the 
number of students enrolled in each system can be ascertained, 
while this information is not available for the different systems in 
schools teaching more than one system. Figure 18 enables the reader 
to ascertain at a glance the relative number of schools included in 
each classification.

  416 "BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
NUMBER OF SHORTHAND SYSTEMS TAUGHT IN EACH SCHOOL. 
By reference to this figure it will be noted that 50 schools reporting 
did not teach shorthand in 1918; 547 taught only one system; 202, 
two systems; 38, three systems; 11, four systems; 2, five systems; 
1, six systems; 8 replies were indeterminate; and 31 schools did not 
report the names of the systems taught, although they offered 
shorthand courses. Eliminating from consideration all schools not 
reporting the exact number of systems taught or not offering steno- 
graphic courses, it is found that 68 per cent of the 801 schools report- 
ing such information offered only one system of shorthand. In

    Fig. 18.—Number of systems of shorthand taught in 890 private commercial schools, 1917-18. 
1916, out of a total of 701 schools reporting corresponding data, 480 
schools, or 68 per cent, taught only one system. Apparently, there- 
fore, there has been no change since 1916 in the relative number of 
schools teaching only one system. of shorthand. Eliminating the 
50 schools not teaching shorthand, the 8 schools whose replies were 
indefinite, and the 31 schools not reporting the systems taught, it is

PRIVATE COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS, 1917-1918. 417 
found that 93 per cent, or practically all commercial schools in 1918, 
teach only one or two systems of shorthand. 
WHAT SYSTEMS THE LARGEST SCHOOLS TEACH. 
It is of special interest to know what systems of shorthand the 
largest schools teach. To answer this question figure 19 has been 
prepared. It was found that 76 schools enrolled 500 students or 
more in the stenographic course and these schools were arbitrarily 
chosen for the construction of this figure. Of the 76 schools, 44 
taught only one system, and 32, two or more systems of shorthand. 
It should be remembered, however, that the number (500) is about 
twice as large as the number actually present at any one time in the 
schools chosen for this graph, since the student body in the steno- 
graphic course usually changes twice during the year. Consequently,

all private commercial schools enrolling approximately 250 students 
or more at any one time in the stenographic course have been in- 
cluded. The black section of the bars contain many duplicates, 
since a school may teach the Gregg, one or more of the Pitman, sys- 
tems, and possibly a machine system. This statement applies only 
to the schools represented by the black section of the bars, which

-P-A-G-E-418
418 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
indicates schools teaching this system and one or more other systems. 
Thus, the 31 schools teaching the Gregg, shown by the black bar, are 
duplicated in the other systems specifically indicated and many of 
them also in the bar, ‘‘All Pitman Systems.” The bar, both black 
and white, representing ‘‘All Pitman Systems,”’ is wholly duplicated 
in the Pitman systems definitely named above it or in the “‘catch- 
all”? phrase, ‘‘All other systems.’’ The white section of the bars 
represents schools teaching only one system of shorthand and con- 
tains no duplication except in the second bar from the top as just 
explained. 
The Gregg is taught in the largest number of large schools; viz., 
48 schools. If all duplicates are eliminated from the systems con- 
sidered as Pitmanic, as indicated in Table 5, it is found that 40 
different schools teach a Pitman system or a system based on Pitman 
Among the Pitman systems the Benn Pitman and the Isaac Pitman 
lead with 10 and 9 schools respectively. 
Tn all, 17 schools teach the Gregg exclusively and 13 others a 
Pitman system. 
Tt is found that the machine shorthand systems are also repre- 
sented here, 5 schools teaching the stenotype and 2 schools the 
National shorthand machine. The machine method is not used 
exclusively in any school reporting. 
All systems which are taught in 2 or more of these large schools 
have been named specifically in the graph. Six schools grouped 
together in the last bar teach one system each, viz, the Barnes- 
Pitman, Dement-Pitmanic, Pitman-Schoch, the Modern Pitmanic, 
and Sloan-Duployan, each of which is taught in connection with 
some other system, and the Byrne Simplified which is taught exclu- 
sively in one large school. The first four systems just named and 
considered herein as Pitman have been included also in the second 
bar, ‘‘All Pitman Systems.” 
AVERAGE ENROLLMENT IN THE STENOGRAPHIC COURSE IN SCHOOLS 
TEACHING ONE SYSTEM OF SHORTHAND. 
  It is not sufficient to show the number of large schools teaching 
each system, since only the exceptional schools are considered. To 
show the average size of classes in shorthand for the 12 leading sys- 
tems, figure 20 has been prepared. It should be remembered, how- 
ever, that these averages are almost twice as large as the average 
enrollment in shorthand courses at any one time, since the student 
body changes approximately twice during the year. 
In Table 5, column 9, the average enrollment in stenographio 
courses offered in one-system schools is shown. These averages are 
obtained by dividing the total enrollment in such courses by the cor- 
responding number of schools teaching each system. It is almost
-P-A-G-E-419
  PRIVATE COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS, 1917-1918. 419 
impossible and not very desirable to show graphically the average en- 
rollment in stenographic courses for all the different systems of short- 
hand taught. Consequently, the 12 systems most generally taught 
by all private commercial and business schools have been selected 
for study. These 12 systems are the only ones taught in 1 or more 
than 1 per cent of the schools teaching one system only as shown in 
Table 5, column 2. It is found, as will be observed in figure 20, that 
the Isaac Pitman system ranks highest in this score, with an average 
enrollment of 281 students in shorthand courses in one-system schools.

  Fig. 20.—Average enrollment in the stenographic course in private commercial schools teaching only one 
system of shorthand—for the 12 systems most frequently given, 1917-18. 
The Graham-Pitman shows an average of 219; the Munson, an ayver- 
age of 173; and the Gregg, an average of 164. The average for all 
Pitman systems is 177, and for all systems is 164, the same as that for 
the Gregg. Undoubtedly, the average is determined very largely 
by the Gregg, as 53.8 per cent of all students in stenographic courses 
in one-system schools are taking the Gregg system of shorthand. 
From column 1, Table 5, it is found that the averages used in this 
graph have been secured by using the total number of one-system 
schools reporting. . In the case of the Pitman-Howard, only 7 schools 
reported one system of shorthand. It is possible that the average    
-P-A-G-E-420
  420 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
used for this system is not representative. Similarly, the averages for 
the Barnes-Pitman, the Boyd, the Byrne Simplified, and the Spen- 
cerian may not be accurate, since only 8, 8, 8, and 9 schools, respec- 
tively, reported these systems only. In securing all other averages 
at least 11 schools were used. In each case, however, the total 
number of schools reporting enrollment in one system only was used, 
and, consequently, it is doubtful if more representative averages 
could be secured. 
AVERAGE ENROLLMENT FOR THE YEAR IN STENOGRAPHIC COURSES. 
  It has been remarked above that the average enrollment for the 
year in stenographic courses in one-system schools is 164. It is of 
interest to compare this average with that of two-or-more-system 
schools. If the total enrollment in the stenographic courses in such 
schools, 66,712, is divided by the number of such schools (262) a 
quotient of 255 is obtained. It is seen, therefore, that the average 
enrollment in the stenographic course in two-or-more-system schools 
is 55 per cent higher than the corresponding enrollment in one- 
system schools. The average for all schools teaching shorthand is 
184 students (149,124 students divided by 809 schools). In general, 
it is shown in the following pages that any conclusion drawn from 
the data on either type of school applies also to the other. 
PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS TAKING AND OF ONE-SYSTEM SCHOOLS 
TEACHING THE 12 SYSTEMS OF SHORTHAND MOST GENERALLY 
TAUGHT IN 1918. | 
The black bars in figure 21 show the percentage of schools teach- 
ing each of the 12 leading systems of shorthand in schools offering 
only one system in 1918. Altogether, 547 schools teach only one 
system of shorthand. It is found in Table 5, column 2, that 53.2 
per cent of these schools teach the Gregg system; 37.7 per cent, 
some Pitman system; 8.4 per cent the Benn Pitman; 8.2 per cent, 
the Isaac Pitman; and so on as shown in the graph. In all, 83,412 
students in stenographic courses were reported by these 547 schools 
teaching only one system of shorthand. Of this number 53.8 per 
cent were taking the Gregg; 39.72 per cent, some Pitman system; 
13.10 per cent, the Isaac Pitman; 7.92 per cent, the Benn Pitman, 
etc. It will be observed that the 12 systems are ranked in the order 
of magnitude of the black bars representing the number of schools. 
It is preferable to have the percentage of schools rather than the 
percentage of students determine the order of precedence since in 
figure 23, where only the number of schools is used, the same order 
will be maintained and the same systems represented. It is remark- 
able that the black and the open bars show so much similarity in 
their relative lengths.

In 1916 no statistics were published showing the number of stu- 
dents taking each system of shorthand offered in one-system schools. 
It is more desirable to show whether each system has gained or lost 
students since 1916 than to show whether there has been an increase 
or decrease in the percentage of schools offering each of the 12 lead- 
ing systems. The former condition can not be shown, as compara- 
tive data are not available. In the preceding paragraph, however, 
it was pointed out that a great similarity exists between the per- 
centage of schools offering and of students taking each system.

Fia. 22.—Percentage of private commercial schools (teaching only one system) which teach the systems 
of shorthand most generally offered, 1917-18. 
As comparative data in the number of schools offering only one 
system of shorthand for the consecutive biennial reports, 1916 and 
1918, are available, this information has been used in the construc- 
 
-P-A-G-E-423
PRIVATE COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS, 1917-1918. 423 
tion of figures 22, 23, and 24. In figure 22 it will be observed that 
the Gregg system in 1918 (black bars) was taught in 53.2 per cent 
of the 547 schools teaching only one system and in 1916 (open bars) 
in 42.1 per cent of the 480 one-system schools reporting at that time. 
The Gregg has gained the difference between 53.2 per cent and 42.1 
per cent, or 11.1 per cent, in the number of one-system schools. 
This means an increase of 11.1 per cent on 42.1 per cent, or a gain 
of 26.4 per cent. This increase is shown by the open bar in figure 
24. During this interval a decrease of 20.3 per cent is shown for 
all Pitman systems. It will be observed in figure 22 that the black 
bar is longer than the white one in only four instances, viz, Byrne 
Simplified, Graham-Pitman, Gregg, and Isaac Pitman. The other 
8 systems show a decrease in the percentage of schools teaching 
each exclusively. 
It will be observed that the percentage of schools rather than the 
total number of schools teaching each system exclusively has been 
used and the percentage of increase or decrease computed therefrom. 
A different but erroneous result would be obtained by computing the 
percentage of increase or decrease from the total number of schools 
reporting, since, in 1916, only 77 per cent of the schools (701 schools 
out of a total of 912 reporting) indicated the systems of shorthand 
taught, whereas in 1918, 90 per cent (801 out of 890 reporting) indi- 
cated the systems taught. In other words, this year replies were 
received from 100 more schools than reported the systems of short- 
hand taught two years ago. It should be noted also that 22 more 
schools reported in 1916 than did in 1918. Undoubtedly, these 100 
schools taught shorthand in 1916 but did not name the systems 
taught, since the question, ‘‘What system of shorthand do you 
teach?” was asked for the first time two years ago. Presumably, 
68 of these 100 schools, in 1916, taught one system only and 32, two 
or more systems, if the ratio between one-system and more-than-one- 
system schools holds as indicated in figure 18. It would be erroneous, 
therefore, to count such schools, not reporting in 1916 but reporting 
in 1918, as increases in the number of schools teaching the respective 
systems of shorthand, either for one-system schools or for more-than- 
one-system schools. The reliability of this percentage method of 
computing rates of change is based on the assumption that the same 
relative percentage of schools taught each system in 1916 as in 1918. 
INCREASE OR DECREASE SINCE 1916 IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SCHOOLS 
TEACHING EACH OF THE 10 SYSTEMS OF SHORTHAND MOST GENER- 
ALLY TAUGHT IN 1918. 
In considering the total number of schools teaching each system of 
shorthand the 10 leading systems, as indicated in Table 5, column 13, 
have been chosen for comparison. It will be observed that each of 
   
-P-A-G-E-424
  424 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
these 10 systems is taught in 17 schools or more, or in at least 2 per 
cent of all schools reporting shorthand courses. The Barnes-Pitman, 
Boyd, and Byrne Simplified systems do not appear,. therefore, in 
figures 23, 24, and 25, while the Stenotype, which deos not appear in 
the discussion of one-system schools, has been added. If the three 
systems dropped from consideration had been included it would have 
been necessary to add the Eclectic, which is tatfght in 9 schools.

  Fig. 23.—Percentage of all private commercial schools which teach the systems most generally given, 
1917-18. 
In 1918, altogether 809 schools reported the system or systems of 
shorthand taught. As shown in figure 23, 64.4 per cent of these 
schools offered the Gregg; 10.5 per cent, the Isaac Pitman, etc. 
In 1918, 381 different schools, or 44 per cent of the total number 
reporting, offered a Pitmanic system, but in 1916 this information 
was not tabulated, so that the percentage of increase or decrease for 
all Pitman systems since 1916 in all schools can not be ascertained 
from the data at hand. In 1916, 701 schools hamed the system or 
systems taught. Figure 23 shows that 54.8 per cent offered the 
Gregg; 9.3 per cent the Isaac Pitman, ete. The same condition 
prevails as was pointed out in the preceding graph, viz, that the Gregg, 
Graham-Pitman, and the Isaac Pitman in 1918 show an increase 
over 1916 in the percentage of all schools teaching these systems. 
The other 7 systems show a decrease. The method used in computing 
the change in percentage is the same as that used for schools teaching 
only one system of shorthand. For example, the Munson was
-P-A-G-E-425
  
PRIVATE COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS, 1917-1918, 425 
taught in 1916 in 6 per cent of the schools and in 1918 in only 5 per 
cent of the schools. The decrease is, therefore, 1 per cent on a base 
of 6 per cent, or 16.7 per cent as shown in figure 24, 
CHANGE SINCE 1916 IN THE PERCENTAGE OF PRIVATE COMMERCIAL 
SCHOOLS TEACHING EACH OF THE TEN SYSTEMS OF SHORTHAND 
MOST GENERALLY TAUGHT IN 1918. 
As explained above, figure 24 shows whether a system of short- 
hand has “gained” or “lost” schools within the past two years. 
The Graham-Pitman system has gained the largest percentage of 
schools, showing an increase of 30 per cent in the relative percentage 
of schools teaching this system. This does not mean that this 
system is being learned by 30 per cent more students than studied 
it in 1916. It shows only the increase in the percentage of schools 
teaching this system. The Gregg system shows the greatest gain in 
the number of schools teaching one system exclusively, while the 
Graham-Pitman ranks second. The Stenotype shows the greatest 
loss in the total number of schools teaching this system, and the 
Pitman-Howard the greatest loss in one-system schools. It must 
be remembered that the other systems not chosen for study, and, 
therefore, not included in the graphs, also show increases or decreases. 
In fact, the systems not taught in 1916 but reporting only a few 
schools in 1918 would show infinite gains. Likewise discontinued 
systems show loss of 100 per cent. The percentages of increase or 
decrease similar to those shown in figure 24 can be readily ascertained 
for other systems of shorthand from Table 5, columns 3, 5, 14, and 16. 
The exact method used in computing the length of the bars used in 
figure 24 is given in Table 6. It should be added that since 1916 
the Barnes-Pitman and the Boyd Syllabic have decreased 39 per 
cent and 7 per cent, respectively, while the Byrne Simplified has 
increased 56 per cent in the percentage of schools teaching each 
system. As the number of schools reporting each system is small, 
these percentages may not be authentic and consequently have not 
been inserted in figure 24. 
OPPORTUNITY OF STUDENTS TO ELECT THE TEN LEADING SYSTEMS 
OF SHORTHAND. 
It is unfortunate that the total number of students taking each 
system of shorthand offered in all private commercial schools is not 
- known. Fairly accurate deductions have been drawn already from 
schools teaching only one system. It is of interest to note the 
opportunity which students have to elect the different systems 
taught. In other words, how many students are ‘“exposed’”’ to each 
system? The richness of a curriculum is determined by the oppor- 
tunity afforded students to choose among a variety of subjects.

PRIVATE COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS, 1917-1918. 427 
It is found in Table 5 that the total number of students enrolled 
in stenographic courses in schools reporting the names of the 
systems taught was 149,124. Of this number, 106,083 students 
were enrolled in schools teaching the Gregg only or the Gregg and one 
or more other systems. This means that 71.14 per cent of all stu- 
dents enrolled in the stenographic courses were ‘‘exposed”’ to the 
Gregg. This percentage is somewhat higher than that representing

the actual percentage of students taking the Gregg in one-system 
schools; viz, 53.8 per cent. This apparent discrepancy is explained 
by the fact that the two percentages represent different things— 
the former “opportunity” to take, the latter, the percentage actually 
taking. Altogether 87,062 students, or 58.3 per cent of the total 
number in stenographic courses, were enrolled in schools offering a 
Pitman system. This percentage also is higher than the 39.72 per 
cent given for Pitman systems in figure 21, for the reasons just cited. 
The same variance is shown for other systems as well. The fact that - 
a student may have chosen a school because a certain system of 
shorthand is taught has not been considered since schools are more 
generally selected because a certain course of superior quality is 
offered, because the tuition rates are reasonable, or because a position 
is guaranteed upon graduation. In figure 25 the relative rank of the 
10 leading systems is shown. By comparing the ranking in this 
graph with that shown in figure 21, it will be observed that the four 
leading systems—the Gregg, Isaac Pitman, Benn Pitman, and Gra- 
ham—maintain their relative positions on both scores in the order 
just named. In general, the same relative ranks are maintained in 
both figures. It should be noted that the total number of students 
   
-P-A-G-E-428
  428 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
“exposed” in the second column of figure 25 exceeds the total enroll- 
ment in stenographic courses. Likewise the corresponding per- 
centages exceed 100. This apparent discrepancy is explained by 
the fact that a large number of students have an opportunity to 
take more than one system. ‘ : 
  COURSES NOT CONSIDERED. 
It should be remarked that the foregoing study of shorthand 
systems does not include the total number of students pursuing the 
subject of shorthand in private commercial and business schools. 
The students in the combined and secretarial courses offered by 
many schools are not included in this study. However, the con- 
clusions reached above undoubtedly will hold for the total number 
of students in private commercial schools taking shorthand in all 
courses in which it is a requisite. 
It should be remembered also that no attempt has been made to 
determine whether one system of shorthand is better than another, 
nor to ascertain the usual time required to complete each. These 
two factors, however, may function in producing the situation just 
presented, but no data are available to warrant conclusive deductions 
relative thereto.

BIENNIAL REPORT. 
_ After compiling educational statistics for 1916 the Bureau of Edu- 
cation adopted the plan of collecting statistics biennially instead of 
annually as in preceding years. Consequently, no special statistics 
on summer schools were collected for 1917. However, the number 
of students in such schools in 1917 is given in the Biennial Survey 
in the chapters on colleges, universities, and professional schools, 
and on normal schools, and are roughly comparable with the corre- 
sponding statistics for such institutions appearing herein. 
CLASSIFICATION OF SUMMER SCHOOLS. 
It was thought’advisable this year to divide the summer schools 
into two classes; one consisting of summer schools more or less closely 
identified with standard colleges, universities, and professional 
schools, and normal schools; the other made up very largely of 
independent summer schools and schools conducted by private high 
schools and academies and by institutions of higher rank which do 
not offer a full collegiate or normal school course. This classification 
makes possible a.comparison. of the enrollment in summer schools 
of the first group, as summarized herein, with the enrollment in 1917, 
as given in the preceding chapters of the Biennial Survey on colleges, 
universities, and professional schools, and on normal schools. Con- 
sequently, by means of this classification, annual statistics on the 
enrollment in summer schools of colleges, universities, and normal 
schools are obtainable. .

NUMBER OF SCHOOLS. 
Hitherto all types of summer schools have been included in this 
report. As many of these were more or less temporary in nature, 
comparative statistics of such a heterogeneous group of schools have 
limited application and are of doubtful value. Consequently, no 
attempt was made in 1918 to secure a report from Y. M. C. A. 
schools, from summer camps, from summer schools organized for the 
expressed purpose of preparing persons for examinations for teachers’ 
certificates, from summer schools conducted by cities, or from special 
summer schools for training teachers of the deaf, blind, and feeble- 
minded. For the benefit of persons who desire to know the name, 
location, and date of session of such schools, this information will be 
included in each annual educational directory published by the 
Bureau of Education and will answer most inquiries satisfactorily. 
This change in the plan of collecting statistical data from summer 
schools has caused a noticeable variation from the corresponding 
statistics collected in preceding years. It is desirable therefore to 
point out by means of comparative tables and graphs the variation 
in certain fundamental data. 
The total number of summer schools included in this report is 480. 
This number includes 358 schools conducted by the colleges, uni- 
versities, and normal schools listed in Table 9, and 122 other summer 
schools listed in Table 10. The 358 schools of collegiate or normal 
school rank include 104 summer schools of standard universities, 119 
schools of standard colleges, and 135 schools conducted by normal 
schools. Comparative data on the total number of schools reported 
in preceding years are given in Table 1. In 1916 the number of 
summer schools reporting was 734. Of this number, 231 schools 
were not asked to submit a report this year. The actual decrease, 
therefore, in the number of schools is only 23, which may be accounted 
for by the failure of certain schools to submit a report this year. In 
fact, it has been found extremely difficult to secure statistical reports, 
because of war conditions and the epidemic of Spanish influenza. It

has been assumed throughout the following discussion that the list 
of schools reporting this year has been as representative as in pre- 
ceding years, barring the exclusions enumerated above.

INSTRUCTORS. 
In the summer schools of colleges, universities, and normal schools, 
10,564 instructors were reported, including 6,713 men and 3,851 
women; and in the second group of summer schools 1,396 instructors 
were reported, including 759 men and 637 women. ‘The total number 
of instructors in all summer schools reported in 1918 was 11,960, 
including 7,472 men and 4,488 women. Comparative statistics on 
the teaching staff in summer schools since 1911, the date when the 
Bureau of Education began systematically to collect reports on sum- 
mer schools, are given in Table 1. Figure 1 shows graphically the 
increase or decrease in the teaching staff in summer schools since 
1911. The upper curve represents the total number of instructors, 
and the lower curves the number of men and women composing the 
total. : 
To secure comparable data for 1916 and 1918 the number of 
instructors in the 231 schools not included in this year’s report has 
been ascertained. The vertical distance between the corresponding 
disconnected lines in figure 1 represents this elimination. The sup- 
plementary points, indicated by “stars”? on the graph, show the
-P-A-G-E-512
    512 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
teaching staff in all other schools reporting in 1916 and are directly 
comparable with the corresponding data for 1918, to which they are 
connected. The drop, therefore, in the two upper curves between 
1916 and 1918 can not be attributed to the exclusion of certain 
schools from the report this year, but must indicate an actual decrease 
in the total teaching force and in the number of men instructors. 
In these 231 schools included in the 1916 report, but eliminated 
from the 1918 report, 1,839 men and 2,689 women instructors were 
employed. If only the same type of schools as are included in this 
report had been included in the 1916 report, the statistics would have 
shown 8,807 men and 4,265 women instructors, instead of 10,646 and 
6,954, respectively. Consequently, the report for 1918 shows a 
decrease of 1,335 men instructors and an increase of 223 women 
instructors in summer schools. This increase of 5 per cent in the 
number of women instructors and decrease of 15 per cent in the 
number of men instructors since 1916 has undoubtedly been caused 
by war conditions. On the whole there has been an actual decrease 
of 1,112, or 7.7 per cent, in the teaching staff in summer schools of 
the types included in this report. 
STUDENTS. 
The total number of students enrolled in summer schools in 1918 
was 160,422, consisting of 33,445 men and 126,977 women. Of the 
total number reported, 90 per cent, or 144,686 students, were enrolled 
in summer schools of standard colleges, universities, and normal 
schools. Twenty per cent of the total collegiate or normal school 
enrollment, or 28,666 students, were men, and 80 per cent, or 116,020 
students, were women. In the summer schools of other institutions 
15,736 students were enrolled, of whom 4,779, or 30 per cent, were 
men, and 10,957, or 70 per cent, women. Comparative historical 
data on summer-school enrollment are shown in figure 2. 
As in the case of the teaching staff, so in figure 2 supplementary 
points representing the enrollment in 1916 have been ascertained and 
are indicated by “stars” on the graph. These points are directly 
comparable to the corresponding points for 1918, to which they have 
been connected. The vertical distance between the corresponding 
disconnected lines in 1916 represents the elimination incident to the 
exclusion of certain schools from the report. The enroliment in 1916 
in the 231 schools not included in the list this year was 39,608 men 
and 56,241 women. If these numbers are deducted from the total 
enrollment reported in 1916 in Table 1, remainders of 68,347 and 
134,023 are obtained respectively for men and women. In other 
words, in corresponding types of schools reporting in 1916 and in 
1918 there has been a decrease of 34,902 in the number of men stu- 
dents and of 7,046 in the number of women students enrolled. It
-P-A-G-E-513
  
SUMMER SCHOOLS IN 1918. 513 
can be safely assumed that this decrease of 51 per cent in the number 
of men students and of 5 per cent in the enrollment of women students, 
or a combined decrease of 21 per cent, has been due to war conditions. 
A comparison with the percentages obtained above for the teaching 
staff shows that the student body has been more affected by war 
conditions than the instructing force, a fact which might have been 
anticipated. :

Apparently from figure 2 there has been from 1911 to 1916 a greater

To secure the indices used in the graph the enrollment for each 
year is divided by the average enrollment of men and of women, 
respectively... The indices for the male enrollment for the past seven 
years are plotted in the graph as the solid line and the corresponding 
indices for the female enrollment are plotted as the broken line. In 
general, a greater proportional rate of change is shown for the 
male enrollment than for female enrollment. From 1915 to 1918 the 
proportional rate of increase is greater for the female enrollment. 
It is safe to assume that fewer men in 1918 attended summer school 
on account of war conditions. This method of presentation does not 
measure the proportional rate of change but only shows that a varia- 
tion exists. The graph warrants the conclusion that in general an 
increasingly larger number of men than women are attending summer 
schools. In other words, if the average summer school in 1913 
enrolled 100 men and 100 women, in 1914 it might be assumed that 
possibly the same school would enroll 120 men and 110 women. An 
increasing number of institutions are offering summer courses accred- 
ited for degrees, as will be observed in figure 8, and many students 
enrolled during the regular terms are induced to remain for the sum- 
mer term to shorten the time required for graduation. As a greater 
percentage of men than women are enrolled in collegiate courses, it 
 
-P-A-G-E-515
  SUMMER SCHOOLS IN 1918. 515 
is a fairly correct inference that more regular men than women stu- 
dents will remain in the institution for summer school work, thereby 
tending to produce the result shown in figure 3.

LENGTH OF TERM. 
The average length of session of all summer schools reported in 
1918 was 7.6 weeks. This average, however, is not especially sig- 
nificant, since not a single summer school had a session of exactly 
this period. In fact, only 18 summer schools had a session of 7 
weeks. By reference to figures 4 and 5, it is noted that the most 
common type of summer school is the one having a session of 6 
weeks. Of the total number, 158 colleges, universities, and normals, 
or 44.3 per cent, held a session of 6 weeks, and 42 other summer 
schools, or 34.4 per cent of the total number, held a session for the 
same length of time. In other words, 200 schools out of a total of 
480, or 42 per cent, held a session of 6 weeks. 
It will be observed especially in figure 4 that a fairly large group 
of schools hold sessions of 8, 9,10, or 11 weeks. Altogether, 126 col- 
leges, universities, and normal schools fallin this group. In all prob- 
ability the tendency in such institutions is to maintain a longer 
term than 6 weeks. Future comparative studies of the summer 
schools of these institutions will verify or refute this assumption. 
Another significant fact portrayed in figure 4 is that, while 44.3 per 
cent of such schools maintain a 6 weeks term, they enroll only 38.8 
per cent of the students; and that, while the institutions maintain- 
ing sessions of 8, 9, 10, or 11 weeks constitute 35.3 per cent of the 
total number, they enroll 45.4 per cent of the students. This fact   
 
-P-A-G-E-517
  SUMMER SCHOOLS IN 1918. 517 
may be taken to indicate a tendency on the part of students to seek 
schools maintaining the longer term. This conclusion seems to apply 
only to summer schools or colleges, universities, and normal schools, as 
the converse is true of other summer schools offering work below col-

legiate grade, as is shown in figure 5, where 34.4 per cent of the 6 
weeks’ schools enroll 40.1 per cent of the total number of students, 
while 24.6 per cent of the schools running 8, 9, 10, or 11 weeks enroil 
only 14.8 per cent of the students. It is pride, therefore, that 
there is a tendency for students to attend a longer summer term if 
the work offered therein is accredited on a degree or counts toward 
graduation. Whether these conditions are characteristic of these 
institutions during the regular year’s work has not been ascertained 
and is not germane to the discussion. The conclusion that students 
attend summer schools to shorten the period required for gradua- 
tion is warranted. 
It may be pointed out that the institutions in figures 4 and 5 fall- 
ing at the extremes of each graph are extraordinary. Those offer- 
ing a very short course are more like institutes than summer schools, 
while those maintaining a very long term either hold two or more 
sessions or begin the special summer term very early in the spring, 
usually to accommodate teachers who seek admission to a summer 
school as soon as their school term is ended. 
COST OF MAINTAINING SUMMER SCHOOLS. 
Figure 6 shows the variation in average cost for a period of years. 
Tt will be noticed that the average cost per student of conducting 
summer schools in 1918 was $24.14. This is a decided increase over

  SUMMER SCHOOLS IN 1918. 519 
the average cost in 1916, which was only $14.85. This apparent dis- 
crepancy is partly explained by the fact that so many special inde- 
pendent teacher-training schools, in which the cost of maintenance 
is extremely low, have not been included in the report this year. 
In 1916, 187 schools included in the 231 schools from which a report 
was not sought this year reported an enrollment of 74,225 students 
and a total aggregate cost of $546,366. The per capita cost of main- 
tenance, therefore, was only $7.36. As the per capita cost for all 
summer schools in 1916 was $14.85, the per capita cost of mainte- 
nance in the 187 schools eliminated was only about one-half as much 
as the cost in all schools reporting at that time. If the 187 schools 
had been excluded from the 1916 report, the per capita cost would 
have been $17.85. This average cost is directly comparable with 
the average cost for 1918 and has been so indicated on the graph. 
The increased per capita cost, therefore, for maintaining summer 
schools since 1916 has been 35 per cent. 
Here again, the average does not tell the whole story, inasmuch as 
no account has been taken of the increase or decrease of the length 
of term of summer sessions. Evidently the per capita cost of main- 
taining a group of schools for 7 weeks will be greater than for 6 weeks. 
For this reason it is necessary to compute the per capita cost per 
week. 
In Table 4 the schools reporting cost of maintenance have been 
grouped according to the length of the session held. In the col- 
legiate and normal school group the per capita cost per week varies 
from $16.73 in schools maintained for 2 weeks to $0.89 in schools 
maintained for 18 weeks. In other summer schools the per capita 
cost ranges from $10.64 in schools running for 2 weeks to $0.35 in a 
school maintained for 20 weeks. In general, the longer the term the 
less the per capita cost of maintenance. This statement is made 
clearer by reference to figure 7, in which a gradual decrease in cost 
is shown from left to right. The per capita cost per week in the - 
largest groups of colleges, universities, and normal schools, viz, in 
schools running for 6, 8, 9, 10, and 11 weeks is less in schools main- 
tained for 8, 9, and 10 weeks. The per capita costs reported for 
schools maintained for a very short or for a very long term are 
unusual and are not characteristic of the group as a whole. The 
extreme variation from the usual cost of summer schools is brought 
out clearly in figure 7, in which the per capita cost per week is given 
for colleges, universities, and normal schools, for other summer 
schools below collegiate rank, and for both classes combined. It may 
be added that 454 summer schools, out of a total of 480, reported 
the estimated cost of maintenance. In other words, 95 per cent of 
all summer schools reported cost. In these schools over 97 per cent 
of the total enrollment is represented.

COURSES ACCREDITED FOR DEGREES. 
By reference to Table 1 and figure 8 it will be observed that in 
general an increasing number of institutions offer at least a few 
courses accredited for degrees. A slight drop occurs in 1918, which 
may be due to war conditions. Only 11 schools which have been 
dropped from the list were counted in the preceding report as in- 
stitutions offering courses accredited for degrees. The remaining 
number of 284 institutions, reporting courses accredited for degrees 
in 1916, is comparable with the total reported this year and has been 
so indicated on the graph. It must be borne in mind that several 
institutions which do not themselves grant degrees offer courses 
accredited for degrees in other institutions. This is true of a great 
many courses offered in summer normal schools. In 1918, 270 in- 
stitutions offered courses for first or undergraduate degrees, and 88 
institutions for graduate degrees. Only 2 schools offered courses 
accredited for graduate degrees only. The total number of institu- 
tions, therefore, offering courses accredited for degrees was 272, 
LECTURERS. 
The total number of lecturers reported by summer schools in 1918 
was 1,762. The number reported in preceding years, excluding 1917, 
when no statistics were collected, was 1,911, 1,748, 1,910, 2,215, 
2,512, and 2,337 in the years 1911 to 1916, respectively. The de- 
crease shown in this report may be due to the exclusion of certain 
summer schools therefrom. 
In 1918 the total number of semipopular lectures, music recitals, 
- etc., reported was 3,568, 
OBSERVATION OR PRACTICE SCHOOLS. 
The number of schools reporting observation or practice schools in 
1913 was 157; 1914, 189; 1915, 200; 1916, 233; and in 1918, 190. 
The enrollment in such schools for these respective years was 10,599, 
14,013, 17,655, 21,295, and 18,345. As practice schools are main- 
tained to supplement the teacher training work, the omission of the 
special independent teacher-training schools from this report may 
account for the noticeable decrease in enrollment and in the number 
of such schools, No data were collected on such schools prior to 
1913, 
A COMPARISON OF ENROLLMENT IN SUMMER SCHOOLS. 
If the 160,422 students enrolled in the summer schools of 1918 had 
been equally distributed among the 480 schools included in this report, 
the enrollment in each would have been 334. It may be said, there- 
fore, that the average size of summer schools maintained in 1918 was 
334. The average does not convey to the reader an accurate picture 
of the enrollment in these schools inasmuch as only 33 schools had
-P-A-G-E-523

an enrollment between 300 and 399 and only 1 school had exactly 
this average enrollment.

A clearer conception of the size of summer schools is gained by 
reference to figure 9, in which the schools have been grouped according 
to the enrollment in each. It will be observed that the most com- 
mon type of summer school is the one enrolling fewer than 100 
students. 
‘fall in this group. Over 36 per cent of all summer schools, or 174 schools, 
In the first three groups 322 schools, or 67 per 
cent of the total number, are included, In other words, about two- . 
thirds of all summer schools have an enrollment considerably less 
than the average. To be exact, 333 schools had an enrollment less than 
the average, whileonly 146 schools had an enrollment greater than the 
average. The average, therefore, is very misleading in this instance 
and does not give so good a picture of the real situation as does the 
distribution table in figure 9. The three very large schools shown 
at the extreme right of the diagram lend undue weight to the aver- 
age and serve to draw it out of a position which would indicate a 
more central tendency if these larger schools had not been included,

SUMMER SCHOOLS IN 1918. 525 
Figure 10 enables the reader to grasp the idea that a very few 
summer schools enroll a very large percentage of the total number 
of pupils attending such schools. Reading from the vertical scale 
it will be observed that half of the total summer school enrollment . 
is found in about 12.5 per cent of the schools. Reading from base 
line it is found that half of the schools enroll almost 90 per cent of 
the total student body. This condition prevails because such a 
large number of summer schools as shown in figure 9 have a very 
small enrollment. Reading the curve conversely from the viewpoint 
of the smaller schools represented, it is noted that 50 per cent of the 
schools enroll only a little over 10 per cent of the students. In this 
group the 240 smaller schools are included. For the purpose of 
showing the dispersion in the distribution of enrollment, a ‘‘line of 
equal distribution”” has been drawn diagonally across the figure 
connecting the extremes of the ordinate and the abscissa. If the 
enrollment were equally distributed in summer schools the points 
locating the curve would fall on the ‘‘line of equal distribution” in 
such a way that 30 per cent of the schools would enroll 30 per cent 
of the students; 50 per cent of the schools, 50 per cent of the students, 
etc. The ‘‘bowing” of the curve away from this ‘‘line”’ indicates 
that great inequality in enrollment exists. The farther the curve 
recedes from the ‘‘line of equal distribution’’ the greater is the 
dispersion. The curve does not give a numerical measurement of 
the dispersion but indicates that it exists. It also enables one to 
read readily the percentage of enrollment in any given percentage 
of schools. The curve forms a very valuable supplement to the dis- 
tribution bars represented in figure 9.

NURSE TRAINING SCHOOLS, 1917-18.

schools—Pupils and graduates—Requirements for admission—Hours of duty required—Remunera-

REASONS FOR SEPARATE TREATMENT. 
Hitherto the statistics of nurse training schools have been in- 
cluded with those of theology, law, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, 
and veterinary science in the chapter of the Annual Report of the 
Commissioner of Education devoted to professional education. This 
year (1918) the statistics of the other professional schools are included 
in the chapter on colleges, universities, and professional schools, and 
the statistics of nurse training schools are printed separately. It is 
highly desirable this year to publish detailed statistics of each nurse 
training school reporting to the Bureau of Education, especially 
since no printed lists or statistics of these schools have appeared 
during the past seven years. In 1912 this bureau published a bulle- 
tin entitled, ‘‘Educational Status of Nursing,’ prepared by M. 
Adelaide Nutting, of Columbia University, in which detailed statis- 
tics were given for the school year 1910-11, and in which the leading 
tendencies in the education of professional nurses were pointed out. 
Since that date the Bureau of Education has published only sum- 
mary tables for these schools. Within the past few years the subject 
of nurse training has received so much attention that it is thought 
desirable this year to publish a special chapter on these schools, 
giving detailed information regarding each school and summary 
tables by States, and pointing out a number of the most pronounced 
conditions and tendencies as revealed by the data contained herein. 
It will be noticed that all schools known to be in existence have 
been included, whether they were able to submit a report or not. 
The list, therefore, forms a complete directory of these schools. No 
reports for the year 1916 have been incorporated in the statistics 
contained herein. The revision of the blank statistical form used in 
collecting data from these schools precluded this possibility. If a 
school failed to report in 1918, only the name and location of it are 
given in this chapter. If estimates had been made for the 67 schools 
not reporting this year, the statistics would have shown a much 
greater increase than is shown in the following pages.

METHODS OF TABULATION FORMERLY USED. 
_ Hitherto, except in 1917, an attempt was made annually to secure 
a complete report from all schools, so that the statistics would repre- 
sent the whole nurse training situation throughout the country. 
Often it became necessary to use the reports for the preceding year, 
to make the statistics complete. For instance, if a school did not 
report in 1916 the report of that school for the preceding year was 
incorporated in the statistics then compiled. An office ruling in 
force in 1912 and in 1913, to the effect that any school in arrears for 
two years with its report should be dropped from the list of schools

  maintained in the Bureau of Education, cut down the aggregate sta- 
tistics for those years as will appear below. If a school did not report 
for two consecutive years it was deemed a ‘‘dead school.’”’ The result 
of this procedure is shown in figure 1. 
CLASSIFICATION OF SCHOOLS. 
As in preceding reports, all schools have been divided into two 
classes: First, schools maintained in hospitals which are more or less 
of general character and function, and second, schools maintained in 
hospitalsfor the treatment of insane patients. It should be remarked, 
however, that many schools classified in the first group offer highly 
specialized training courses, but for the sake of convenience in 
 
-P-A-G-E-551
  NURSE TRAINING SCHOOLS, 1918, 551 
referring to them they all have been designated as nurse training 
schools in ‘‘general hospitals.” These two types of schools have 
been treated separately throughout except in figures 1 to 5, which are 
historical in nature and in which the totals for both types of schools 
havebeencombined. The reasons for continuing this classification are 
self-evident, as will appear in the comparative figures which follow. 
Postgraduate and special training schools have not been grouped 
in a separate table, but have been inserted in their proper places in 
the table giving the detailed statistics on general hospitals. They, 
however, can be readily ascertained by glancing down the column on 
“educational requirements for admission”? where they have been 
definitely indicated. Possibly several other schools offering short 
courses are also graduate or special training schools, but the reports 
did not so indicate. In all, there are only nine graduate schools and 
five special training schools with short courses of instruction. In 
addition, four other schools offer a special course to pupils registered 
in other hospitals.

-P-A-G-E-552
  552 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
NUMBER OF SCHOOLS. 
The total number of schools represented in this chapter is 1,776. 
Of this number, 1,692 are schools maintained in general hospitals, and 
84 are schools maintained in hospitals used exclusively for the treat-: 
ment of insane patients. Of the 1,692 schools in general hospitals, 65 
did not, or could not, report, and only 2 schools in hospitals for the 
insane failed to make statistical reports. Altogether, 1,709 schools 
made a report, nearly all of them giving in full the data requested on 
the statistical blank. 
By reference to figure 1 it will be observed that the number of nurse 
training schools has multiplied rapidly since 1903. The increasesin 
1914, 1915, and 1918 are pronounced. The evident decreases in 1912 
and 1913 are not due to an actual decrease in the number of schools, 
but to the fact that if a school had failed to report its statistics for two 
consecutive years it was dropped from the list of schools maintained 
in the Bureau of Education, and consequently was considered a ‘‘ dead 
_ school.” From 1879, when this bureau first collected the statistics 
of nurse training schools, to 1893 the number of schools reporting did 
not exceed 100. Since the latter date the number of schools has 
increased from 66 to 1,776. The curve, however, represents the total 
number of such schools throughout the country which were known on 
the respective dates to be in existence, and not at any time the total 
number reporting for the current year. The curve shows graphically 
the rapid multiplication of schools of this type throughout the United 
States, which has been almost phenomenal within the last five years. 
Assuming that there were 1,250 schools instead of the low number of 
1,094 in 1913, as accounted for above, there has been an increase of 
526 schools, or 42 per cent, in five years. Approximately 100 new 
schools are being organized annually. 
SIZE OF SCHOOLS. 
In figure 2 the nurse training schools have been classified according 
to the number of nurse pupils enrolled in each school. It is found 
that 804 schools have from 1 to 20 pupils each, and about one-half as 
many, 470 schools, have an enrollment between 21 and 40 pupils, 
inclusive. In other words, 76 per cent of the 1,680 schools reporting 
enrollment do not have more than 40 pupils. The school most fre- 
quently found does not enroll more than 20 pupils, as will be noted by 
the longest bar in the diagram. One very large school enrolls more 
than 300 pupils.

DISTRIBUTION OF PUPILS IN NURSE TRAINING SCHOOLS. 
From the preceding figure it is impossible to tell just how many 
pupils are enrolled in each class of schools represented. Conse- 
quently figure 3 has been arranged to show just what percentage of 
pupils are enrolled in any desired percentage of schools, or vice versa. 
Reading from. the vertical line, it is found that 50 per cent of the 
pupils are enrolled in about 18 per cent of the schools and 80 per cent 
of the pupils in about 48 per cent of the schools. Reading from the 
base line, it is found that 10 per cent of the schools enroll about 35 
per cent of the pupils and 70 per cent of the schools enroll about 92 
per cent of the pupils. If the pupils were equally distributed among 
all of the schools, the curve would follow the “‘line of equal distribu- 
tion” in such a way that 50 per cent of the schools would enroll 50 per 
cent of the pupils, etc. The “bowing” of the curve away from the 
line of equal distribution shows the degree of inequality in the dis- 
tribution of pupils among the schools. The greater the tendency of 
a few schools to enroll a large number of pupils the farther the curve 
“bows”? away from the straight line and recedes toward the lower 
left corner of the figure. As the curve does not bend far from the 
line of equal distribution, it is shown that pupils in nurse training 
schools are rather equally distributed. 
The method used in locating this curve is shown in Table 2. The 
enrollments in the 1,680 schools reporting such data are arranged  
-P-A-G-E-555
  
NURSE TRAINING SCHOOLS, 1918. 555 
in order of size from the largest to the smallest and are placed in 20 
groups, so that each group contains 84 schools, or 5 per cent of the 
total number. It is found that group 1 contains 22.6 per cent of 
the total enrollment in these 1,680 schools and that groups 1 and 2 
combined contain 34.9 per cent of the total. These percentages are 
then plotted on the vertical 5 per cent and 10 per cent lines, respec- 
tively, at the points indicated on the curve. The other points are 
obtained and located in the same manner.

  NURSE PUPILS AND GRADUATES. 
In figure 4 the number of nurse pupils and graduates is shown 
for each year since 1879, except for the years 1882 and 1917 when no 
statistics were collected. The curve representing the number of 
pupils shows the same general fluctuations as were shown in figure 1, 
in which the total number of nurse training schools in the United 
States was represented. A decrease is shown for the years 1911 and 
1912, but very rapid increases appear since 1912. In 1911 and

1912 each school known to be in existence was asked to make a 
report, but if it failed to report, statistics more than two years in 
arrears were not included. 
The data for 1911 are particularly significant for two reasons: 
First, the only comprehensive study of nurse training school statistics 
containing data comparable to the data included herein was made 
by Miss Nutting in 1911. Second, these reports are all the more 
comparable since in 1911 the statistics are practically all for the 
year 1910-11, the reports two years in arrears having been rejected

as explained, and since in this report no “arrearage” data whatever 
have been used. 
The dotted curve represents the number of graduates from nurse 
training schools. The relative percentage of graduates to nurse 
pupils enrolled has not been so great in the more recent years. In 
the period 1894 to 1898, inclusive, 35 per cent of all pupils enrolled 
graduated; in the years 1899 to 1903, inclusive, 31 per cent of all 
pupils graduated; in the years 1904 to 1908, inclusive, 29.2 per 
cent of the pupils graduated; in the years 1909 to 1913, inclusive, 
 
-P-A-G-E-557
  NURSE TRAINING SCHOOLS, 1918, 557 
25.8 per cent of the pupils graduated. In the last five years the 
total number of graduates has been only 24.7 per cent of the total 
number of pupils enrolled. Within recent years about one-fourth 
of the pupils enrolled graduate annually, whereas from 25 to 30 
years ago over one-third of the pupils enrolled graduated. It is 
seen, therefore, that the increase in the number of graduates has not 
been proportional to the increase in the number of pupils enrolled. 
The explanation. of this tendency is probably due to the fact that 
many schools have lengthened the number of years in training from 
two to three years, thereby obliging pupils to remain longer in the 
hospital school to complete the required course. A smaller per- 
centage of pupils will remain to complete a three-year than a two- 
year course. _ 
The small number of nurse training schools, nurse pupils, and 
graduates reported prior to the year 1893 would indicate that few 
professional nurses were being trained in nurse training schools. 
The movement for the training of professional nurses seems to have 
received its most marked and permanent impetus about the year 
1893. 
CAPACITY OF HOSPITALS AND AVERAGE PATIENTS DAILY. 
It is important that a nurse training school have a sufficient 
capacity and an average number of patients daily to make the training 
course have most value. It is a rather generally accepted principle 
that a thoroughly efficient nurse training school should have, at 
least, a capacity of 50 beds with a daily average of 25 patients. In 
fact, with certain accrediting bodies a school is not recognized as a 
standard school unless it meets some such requirement.’ Already 
a movement has begun looking to the consolidation of small nurse 
training schools. Therefore it is desirable to give to the statistics 
bearing on this phase of nurse training some consideration. 
As will be observed from figure 5, the total number of beds, or the 
capacity of the hospitals in which nurse training schools are maintained, 
has increased rapidly since 1900, the year in which the Bureau of 
Education began to collect this class of statistics. Since that date 
the total number of beds reported has increased from 84,227 to 
303,193. Out of the 1,709 nurse training schools reporting only 14 
did not give the number of beds. If each one of these schools had 
the same average number of beds as did the schools reporting this 
item, viz, 180, the total capacity of all hospitals maintaining nurse 
training schools would be 305,713. Each year preceding 1918 also 
needs a corresponding corrective increment. This number still is 
low, since 5 of these 14 schools are in hospitals for the treatment of 
the insane, in which the average capacity is much greater than in

the general hospitals, and since 67 schools failed to submit a report. 
It is possible that this very great increase in the capacity of hospitals 
in which nurse training schools are maintained may be misunder- 
stood, since, with the increase in the number of schools, new hospitals 
are not necessarily organized; but hospitals which previously main- 
tained no nurse training school, and therefore were not asked to 
make a report, are now included in the list of such hospitals, thereby 
apparently greatly increasing the capacity of hospitals in general 
throughout the country, but in reality not doing so in any marked 
degree. These total statistics imply the correct intent when they 
are used in the sense that nurse pupils are now trained in hospitals 
having the capacity indicated for each year. Therefore, the totals 
as given are germane to the subject of training professional nurses. 
It is of interest to note that, since 1900, the total number of nurse 
pupils has increased 395 per cent, while the capacity of the hospitals 
in which they are being trained, as shown in figure 5, has increased 
only 260 per cent. These facts, however, do not necessarily indicate 
that the opportunity afforded for a variety of training has been 
lessened for each individual pupil, since with the advent of larger 
schools, due to consolidation as well as to actual growth, a decrease 
in the per capita capacity does not lessen the variety of observation 
or practice. 
By comparing the curve representing the average number of 
patients with that for the capacity in beds for the same year, it is 
found that the highest percentage of the capacity was utilized in 
1912, the per cent being 79.5, and the lowest percentage was utilized 
in 1915, when only 72.3 per cent was shown. In 1918 the daily 
average number of patients was almost 75 per cent of the capacity 
of the hospitals. This percentage needs modification in view of the 
fact that annually a number of schools do not report the average 
number of patients, but do, generally, give the capacity of the hos- 
pital with which they are affiliated, it being much more convenient 
to report accurately the latter fact than to make an estimate of the 
former. In 1918, 70 schools in general hospitals and 10 schools in 
hospitals used exclusively for the treatment of insane patients did 
not give the average number of patients, but each one did give the 
capacity in beds, aggregating 28,216. Of this number, 7,018 were 
in general hospitals and 21,198 were in hospitals for the insane. 
Only 3 schools reporting the average number of patients, totaling 
1,429, failed to give the number of beds. Only 11 schools, 6 in general 
hospitals and 5 in hospitals for the insane, gave neither capacity nor 
average number of patients. Altogether, 1,615 schools reported both 
the capacity and the average number of patients, the capacity 
aggregating 274,977 beds and the average number of patients 
aggregating 224,470. From these corresponding totals it is found
-P-A-G-E-560
  560 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
that 81.6 per cent of the capacity of hospitals maintaining nurse 
training schools was utilized in 1918. Owing to world war condi- 
tions, this percentage may be higher than in preceding years, but it 
is doubtful if it exceeds the average of preceding years. If the per- 
centages for these years could be accurately determined and plotted 
on the graph, the curve representing the average number of patients 
would fall nearer to the “capacity” curve than it does now.

DISTRIBUTION OF NURSE TRAINING SCHOOLS ACCORDING TO

By reference to Table 3 it will be noted that practically all schools 
in general hospitals have a capacity less than 500 beds, 1,592 schools, 
or over 98 per cent of the total number, falling in this large group. 
If all schools are classified as shown in Table 3, it is found that the 
most common group, that of schools having from 26 to 50 beds each, 
contains 470 schools, or 29 per cent of the total number. Altogether, 
632 schools, or 39 per cent of the total number of such schools, have 
capacity of 50 beds or fewer—the minimum standard often set for an 
efficient nurse training school. 
In hospitals for the insane, as will be observed in Table 4, three- 
fourths of the schools have a capacity of 2,000 beds or fewer. The 
most common group, that of schools having from 1,301 to 1,400 beds, 
has 8 schools, no central tendency for these schools, however, being 
evident. Only one school has fewer than 100 beds, and only eight 
as few as 300.

The capacity of hospitals is not so important as is the average daily 
number of patients, when the facilities for the training of professional 
nurses are considered. For this reason it is thought advisable to 
 
-P-A-G-E-563
  NURSE TRAINING SCHOOLS, 1918, 563 
include in distribution Tables 3 and 4 the number of schools reporting 
the average number of patients. 
By reference to Table 3 it will be noted that 426 general hospitals, 
or 27.5 per cent of the total number of hospitals reporting this item, 
do not report more than 25 daily patients. In 1911, 25 per cent of 
these schools reported 25, or fewer, daily patients, according to 
Bureau of Education Bulletin No. 7, 1912, prepared by Miss Nutting. 
It will be further noted that 455 schools, or 29.3 per cent of the total 
number, report from 26 to 50 patients daily, and 214 schools, or 13.8 
per cent, report from 51 to 75 patients daily. By combining these 
percentages it is found that 70.6 per cent of the total number of 
schools reporting do not have a greater number than 75 daily patients. 
In 1911 the corresponding percentage was 60. Altogether, 1,537 
schools have 500, or fewer, patients daily, only 14 schools exceeding 
this average. 
It is found from Table 4 that only 4 hospitals for the insane main- 
taining nurse training: schools have 100 or fewer daily patients. 
Altogether, 14 schools have 2,000 or more daily patients.

AVERAGE NUMBER OF PATIENTS PER NURSE PUPIL. 
A better index as to the variety of training offered in nurse training 
schools is the average number of patients per nurse pupil. It is, 
however, assumed in the consideration of this phase of the question 
that the care of patients, in the main, is left wholly to the nurse 
pupils. By reference to figure 6, which relates solely to general 
hospitals, it will be observed that the largest group of schools, 615, 
have from 1 to 1.9 patients daily for each nurse pupil in training.

    The actual number of patients cared for by a nurse pupil at any time 
is two or three times this number, since, as is shown below, ordinarily 
a nurse pupil is required to be on duty about 10 hours each day. It 
will be further noted that 443 schools have from 2 to 2.9 patients to 
each nurse pupil. Referring to the extreme instances, it is found 
that 13 schools have 14 or a greater number of patients to each 
nurse pupil and that 99 schools do not have one patient daily to each 
nurse pupil in training. 
In figure 7, representing hospitals for the insane, no central tend- 
ency is shown, no bar being noticeably longer than the other ones.
-P-A-G-E-565
NURSE TRAINING SCHOOLS, 1918, 565 
The most outstanding feature is that practically all schools have a 
greater average of number of patients to each nurse pupil than do the 
schools in general hospitals. In other words, 88 per cent of the 
hospitals for the treatment of the insane have 10 or a greater number 
of daily patients to each nurse pupil, whereas 98 per cent of the 
schools affiliated with general hospitals have fewer than 10 daily 
patients to each nurse pupil.

hospitals reporting, 255, or 36.8 per cent, required 21 years of age for 
admission, while in 1918, out of a total of 1,682 schools reporting, only 
158, or 9.4 per cent, required this age for admission. As will be 
observed in figure 8, the largest group for 1918 requires 18 years of age 
for admission. In other words, 721 schools, or 42.9 per cent of all of 
the schools reporting this information in 1918, gave 18 years as the 
minimum age requirement. It should be added that only 91 schools, 
or 13.2 per cent of the total number of schools, had this requirement 
in 1911. Further, in 1911, it was found that 241 schools, or 34.8 per 
cent, required 20 years as the minimum age for admission. In 1918, 
465 schools, or 27.6 per cent, required 19 years of age for admission,

respective years, it is found that 71.6 per cent of all of the nurse 
training schools maintained in general hospitals required 20 or 21 
years as the age for admission in 1911, whereas, 70.5 per cent required 
either 18 or 19 years in 1918. Itis evident, therefore, that the usual

age requirement for admission has been lowered two years within the 
last seven years. As yet, there appears no decided tendency to admit 
nurse pupils under 18 years of age, since only 13 schools are enumerated 
inthis group. This tendency tolowerthe age requirement for admission 
in the various hospital schools of nursing undoubtedly, in a large

number of nurse pupils to staff the hospitals. 
In hospitals for the insane the most common age requirement for 
admission is also 18 years. 
The number of schools having the various age requirements for 
admission has been shown by States in Tables 7 and 8. In only a 
few States do training schools admit pupils under 18 years of age.

HOURS OF DUTY REQUIRED. 
The number of hours of work required daily in nurse training 
schools maintained in general hospitals has a vital bearing on the 
efficiency of the course offered. Figure 9 shows the distribution of 
schools according to the number of hours of duty required daily. 
Tables 9 and 10 show the number of hours of duty required in the 
various schools by States. Comparable data for the years 1896 and 
1911 on the hours of duty required are available in the ‘“ Educa- 
tional Status of Nursing,” so that comparison may be made between 
the years 1896, 1911, and 1918. 
By reference to Table 11 it is found that 37.9 per cent of the nurse 
training schools reporting in 1896 required of their pupils fewer 
than 10 hours duty; 56.9 per cent in 1911; and only 49.1 per cent 
in 1918. Therefore it is evident that in the more recent years 
there has been a tendency to require 10 or more hours of duty rather 
than fewer hours. It will be observed from figure 9 that a greater 
number of schools, viz, 42.7 per cent of the total number reporting 
this item, require 10 hours of duty. The next largest group, includ 
ing 434 schools, or 26.9 per cent of the total number, requires 9 hours. 
Altogether 232 schools, or 14.4 per cent of the total number, require 
8 hours of duty daily. A slight tendency toward an 8-hour day may 
be foreshadowed in the increasing percentage of schools requiring

8 or fewer hours of duty, viz, 1.8 per cent in 1896, 10.4 per cent in 
1911, and 16.8 per cent in 1918, but as yet the tendency in that 
direction is not very pronounced. It is significant, however, to 
note that only 8.2 per cent of the schools required more than 10 
hours of duty in 1918, while 9.9 per cent held to this requirement 
in 1911, and while 49.5 per cent held to this seemingly questionable 
requirement in. 1896.

In hospitals for the treatment of the insane the hours of duty 
required are usually much longer than in the general hospitals. 
In all, 16 schools require 10 hours of duty; 18 schools, 12 hours; 
and 25 schools require more than 12 hours of duty daily. Two 
schools require 144 hours. 
The long hours of daily duty required in many of these schools 
must be viewed with apprehension, since practically all schools now 
offer a course covering a period of three or more years, whereas 
until 1904 no school had offered a three-year course. To require 
long hours of duty for a period of three years must necessarily work 
a hardship, if not a positive harm, on the nurse pupils in training."

NURSE TRAINING SCHOOLS, 1918. 5T5 
REMUNERATION OF PUPILS. 
This year for the first time nurse training schools were asked to 
report on the regular statistical blank the remuneration granted to 
their pupils. A very large number of replies admitting of tabulation 
were received. The summarized results of this inquiry are shown by — 
States in Tables 9 and 10, and in summarized form in figure 10. 
Only schools reporting both the remuneration granted and their 
enrollment have been included in Tables 12 and 13, and consequently 
in figure 10. For example, the open bars in the first-year group in 
this diagram represent the percentage of schools included in each 
salary group which report both their enrollment and the remuneration 
paid the first year. The percentages for each year total 100. By 
including only the schools reporting both the enrollment and re- 
muneration, it is possible to compare the percentage of schools 
granting a certain remuneration with the corresponding percentage 
of pupils receiving it, which is represented by the straight lines 
within the open bars—more conveniently referred to as “pins.” 
The schools which report remuneration but not enrollment, and which 
have been omitted from consideration, are so few in number that the 
results are not vitiated. It should be added to prevent misunder- 
standing that the number of pupils represented by each “pin” is the 
total number who are now enrolled in institutions granting the remu- 
neration indicated and who, therefore, have already received this fee, 
either in 1918 or in the two years next preceding. The 94 schools which 
report “0” for remuneration have been included in the diagram but 
not in the table. It should be stated that 17 schools, included in the 
94, reported a tuition fee but did not indicate whether a remuneration 
was granted. It has been inferred that no remuneration is granted 
by these institutions. 
Only two schools, one in Minnesota and the other in Mississippi, 
reported the granting of remuneration for the fourth year, the former 
being $204 and the latter being $45. 
The remuneration granted to nurse pupils in the first, second, and 
third year for all schools reporting such information is graphically 
shown above for general hospitals and for hospitals for the treatment ? 
of the insane. Very few general hospitals pay over $200, as is shown. 
In the first year 84 per cent of the schools pay less than $100, while 
only 15.7 per cent pay from $100 to $199. In the second year a 
higher remuneration in general is paid, since 34.1 per cent of the 
schools pay from $100 to $199, and only 65.1 per cent pay less than 
$100. A still higher remuneration is indicated in the third year, 
where almost one-half of the schools, 44.4 per cent, pay from $100 
to $199, and only 53.9 per cent less than $100. Therefore, it is evident 
that a higher remuneration is generally granted as the pupils progress

in the course and as their services pecercaeily become more valuable 
to the institution. 
By comparing the two longer bars in each year in figure 10 it will 
be noted that the ‘‘pin” representing the percentage of the total 
pupil body, paid the remuneration indicated, projects beyond the open 
bar in every instance in which the remuneration is less than $100 and 
does not extend to the end of the bar in schools granting $100 to $199 
per annum. In the latter instance the percentage of pupils does not 
equal the percentage of schools, while in the former one the percentage 
of schools is less than the percentage of pupils. These inequalities 
indicate that the largest schools pay in general the lower remunera- 
tion, in other words tho larger schools have less difficulty in securing 
nurse pupils, presumably, because the variety of training neces- 
sarily offered is correspondingly attractive. On the other hand, 
smaller schools are obliged to pay a higher remuneration that they 
may secure the services of nurse pupils as aids in carrying on the 
work in a well-regulated hospital. 
In hospitals for the treatment of insane patients, as indicated in 
Table 22, the remuneration granted to men is much higher than that 
granted to women in all cases where any difference in remuneration 
is specified, as is done in 10 schools. Only 5 schools report a fee for 
any year in the course which is less than $200, and these are so varia- 
ble in amount and so few in number that they have not been given 
separately in figure 10. They are definitely specified, however, in 
both Table 22 and Table 13, and have been included in the $200 group 
in the graph. 
As indicated in figure 10 the salary, for such it might be correctly 
termed, which is paid the nurse pupils in hospitals for the insane is 
much higher than the remtineration granted to nurse pupils in the 
general hospitals. In the first year in hospitals for the insane 50.8 
per cent of the hospitals, or over one-half of them, pay $300 to $399; 
18.4 per cent pay $400 or a greater sum. In the second year 45.2 
per cent of the schools are placed in the $300 group, and 40.3 per cent 
in the $400 group. In the third year the $300 group has decreased 
to 39.5 per cent and the $400 group has increased to 51.2 per cent. 
In other words, as nurse pupils progress in their training course and 
thereby become more valuable to the hospital, a higher remuneration 
is awarded them. In the third year only 4 schools in hospitals for 
the insane pay as low as $200 to $299. 
The relative length of the ‘“‘pins” and the open bars representing 
respectively, pupils and schools in hospitals for the insane, has been 
reversed from that shown for schools in general hospitals. The ‘‘pins” 
are longer than the bars in the high salary group, viz, $400 and over; 
about the same length in the $300 group, and shorter in the $200 
group, pointing out very clearly that the higher remuneration is

-P-A-G-E-578

granted by the larger schools. It should be remarked, however, in 
this connection that higher salaries should be paid to nurses in the - 
hospitals for the insane than to those in the general hospitals for the 
reason that the hours of duty required in the former are ordinarily 
much longer than those required in the latter, and the duties are 
necessarily of a much more strenuous character, by reason of the pos- 
sible violence of the patients. Therefore, it may be added inferen- 
tially that the increased responsibility in caring for a large number of 
patients induces the larger schools to offer a higher remuneration 
with a view to securing a more advanced group of aids. It does not 
appear from a casual inspection of the detailed reports that longer 
hours of duty are required in the larger schools. It does appear, 
however, that in the larger schools there is usually a large average 
number of patients daily to each nurse pupil enrolled which, in nearly 
every instance, equals or exceeds 40. 
TUITION. 
An inspection of all the reports received from nurse training 
schools reveals the fact that only 42 schools, or 2.4 per cent of 
the total number reporting, charge tuition. All of these schools are 
maintained in general hospitals and charge a fee only for the pre- 
liminary course. Altogether, 26 of these schools grant no remunera- 
tion, or at any rate they do nor report a remuneration fee, and pre- 
sumably give none. The other 16 schools grant a remuneration which 
usually exceeds the tuition charged. The usual tuition fee is either 
$20 or $25, this charge being made by 12 schools. Two schools charge 
$100, 1 school $155, 1 school $225, and 1 school $250. One of the 
schools charging a tuition fee of $100 grants a remuneration of equal 
or greater amount. The other 3 schools reporting these high tuition 
fees offer no remuneration whatever. 
In 1911 only 6 schools charged a tuition for the preliminary instruc- 
tion given in the first year. A fee of $25 was charged by 4 schools, 
and a fee of $50 was charged by 1 other school. One school at that 
time charged $250 for the first two years in the course.

YEARS IN NURSE TRAINING COURSE. 
In view of the fact that practically all courses in nurse training 
schools maintained in general hospitals have been lengthened from 
two to three years within almost the last decade, this subject deserves 
consideration. Altogether, in 1918 the length of course offered was 
reported by 1,606 training schools in general hospitals, and in 1911 
by 688 schools, as follows: 
Length of course. 
  
Schools. 
‘Years in course. ae 
1911 1918 
  
Less than 1 year. 
From 1 to 1.9 yi From 2 to 2.9 years. 
From 3 to 3.9 years... 
A four years’ course...    
      
In 1918 nearly all of the schools in the 2 to 2.9 years group offer a, 
two-year course, only a few giving a fractional part of a year addi- 
tional. Similarly nearly all of the schools falling in the 3 to 3.9 years 
group offer only a three-year course. Only three schools report a 
four-year course, viz: College Hospital, Talladega College, Ala.; 
Evangelical Saint Lucas Deaconess Hospital, Faribault, Minn.; and 
Scudder Infirmary, Alcorn, Miss. 
The greater number of schools by far offer a three-year course, 
88 percent of all the training schools in general hospitals falling in this 
class. Only 10 per cent of these schools offer a two-year course. A 
decided tendency toward a three-year course isevident when acompari- 
son is made between these percentages and the corresponding ones in 
1911. In 1911 a course of three or three and a half years was offered 
by 73 per cent of the schools reporting, as against 88 per cent in 1918; 
and a course of two or two and a half years was offered by 27 per cent, 
as against 10 per cent in 1918. Practically all nurse training schools 
have extended their course to three years within the last few years. 
Long hours of duty, lack of facilities for imparting the technical 
training which should accompany the practical work of the hospital, 
or low educational entrance requirements may prevent nurse pupils 
from receiving the equivalent of a college education. The fact that 
training courses have been lengthened may partly account for the 
increased difficulty in getting qualified pupils to staff the hospitals. 
In schools maintained in hospitals for the treatment of insane 
patients only two and three year courses are offered, 34 schools offer- 
ing a two-year course and 47 schools offering a three-year course.
-P-A-G-E-581
    NURSE TRAINING SCHOOLS, 1918, 581 
ENROLLMENT OF PUPILS IN TRAINING SCHOOLS OFFERING THE 
VARIOUS COURSES. 
By assembling the corresponding groups in Table 14 it is found 
that 7 schools, enrolling 137 pupils, offered a course of less than one 
year; 15 schools, with 261 pupils, a one-year course; 161 schools, 
with 3,306 pupils, a two-year course; 1,397 schools, with 47,644 
pupils, a three-year course; and 3 schools, with 17 pupils, a four-year 
course. These 1,583 schools enroll an aggregate of 51,365 nurse pu- 
pils. The schools offering a course shorter than one year are four- 
tenths of 1 per cent of the total, but enroll only three-tenths of 1 per 
cent of the pupils; those offering a one-year course are 1 per cent of 
the total, but enroll five-tenths of 1 per cent of the pupils; those 
offering a two-year course are 10.2 per cent of the total, but enroll 
only 6.4 per cent of the pupils; but those offering a three-year course 
are 88.2 per cent of the total and enroll 92.8 per cent of the pupils. 
It is seen, therefore, that, in general, the larger schools offer the longer 
course of three years, since these schools enroll a correspondingly 
larger percentage of pupils than the percentage of schools in this 
group would indicate. 
Reducing these percentages to absolute numbers, it is found that 
the average enrollment in a training school of less than one year is 
only 20 nurse pupils; in a one-year school only 18 pupils; in a two- 
year school, 20 pupils; but in a three-year school it is 34 pupils. In 
other words, the schools offering a three-year course enroll 70 per 
cent more pupils on an average than schools offering only a two-year 
course. These very great differences are not apparent from a casual 
inspection of the reports. Two facts appear from these figures: First, 
that practically all professional nurses are now taking a three-year 
course of training; second, the larger schools are giving generally a 
three-year course of training.

  582 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
MINIMUM EDUCATIONAL ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. 
By summarizing the corresponding groups in Table 14 it is found 
that, altogether, 1,592 nurse training schools reported the educational 
entrance requirement for admission in the year 1918. The following 
summary compares the requirement of that year with corresponding 
requirement in the year 1911: 
Educational requirement for admission.

0] 1,592 100.0 794| 100 
  
The most usual requirement in 1918 was one year of high-school 
work. About two-thirds as many schools, however, required a full 
high-school course for admission. Few schools require three years of 
high-school work. 
Considerable shifting in the educational requirements for admission’ 
to nurse training schools has taken place since the year 1911, as will 
be noticed from the comparable data given above. The percentage 
of schools requiring a full high-school course for admission has de- 
creased from 40.6 per cent in 1911, to 28.1 per cent in 1918, while 
the percentage requiring one year of high school has increased from 
24 per cent to 42.7 per cent during the same period. During this 
period the percentage requiring only an eighth-grade education for 
admission has decreased from 31.7 per cent to 12.1 per cent and the 
percentage requiring two years of high-school work has increased 
from 3.3 per cent to 16.5 per cent. It is evident, therefore, that there 
is a tendency on the part of nurse training schools not to require 
either the completion of a high-school course or of the elementary 
grades only, but to require either one or two years of high-school work 
for admission. 
It should be distinctly understood that the minimum educational 
entrance requirement by no means indicates the average educa- 
tional qualifications of pupils who are admitted to nurse training 
schools. Many nurse pupils have a college education, and perhaps 
most of them the equivalent of a full high-school education. The 
standard set for admission governs only the admission of nurse pupils 
who have the lowest educational qualifications which the school will 
consider. With the rapid multiplication of public high schools
-P-A-G-E-583
NURSE TRAINING SCHOOLS, 1918, 583 
throughout the country there should be in the future little reason 
for nurse training schools to lower their educational standard for ad- 
mission. A decided tendency away from only an eighth-grade re- 
quirement is evident already. It is to be regretted that so large a 
percentage of schools have been obliged to retract from the full high- 
school requirement. 
EDUCATIONAL ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS TO NURSE TRAINING 
SCHOOLS IN HOSPITALS FOR THE INSANE. 
In hospitals for the insane, 42 schools for the training of nurse 
pupils require the completion of the eighth grade for admission; 30 
schools require one year of high-school work; and only 6 schools a 
two or three year high-school course. No school requires a 
four-year high-school education. In 1911 it was found that of the 
49 schools reporting educational requirements for admission, 38 
schools required a “common school” or the equivalent of an eighth- 
grade education; 6 schools required one year of high-school work, and 
5 schools a full high-school course. It is evident here also that there 
is a tendency away from the requirement of a full high-school course, 
as no school reporting in 1918 holds to it, and also away from the 
eighth-grade requirement, as 77.6 per cent of the schools of this class 
in 1911 held to this requirement and only 53.8 per cent in 1918. 
The educational requirements for admission to nurse training 
schools is summarized by States in Tables 15 and 16. These tables 
show how many pupils now in training have met these minimum 
standards and how many graduates completing a nurse training course 
in 1918 presumably met these requirements when admitted to train- 
ing. As State legislation often governs the educational requirements 
for admission, it is thought advisable to summarize these minimum 
requirements by States.

    590 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
ENROLLMENT OF PUPILS IN NURSE TRAINING SCHOOLS REPORTING 
BOTH PUPILS AND EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENT FOR ADMISSION. 
The relations between percentage of pupils enrolled in the corre- 
sponding percentage of schools having the various educational require- 
ments for admission is significant. Assembling the corresponding 
data for schools and pupils given in Table 14, it is found that 1,569 
schools report both the educational requirements for admission and 
a total enrollment aggregating 51,082 nurse pupils, distributed as 
follows: 
  
    
  
   
      Requirement for admission (1918). Schools, | Per cent. alee Per cent 
| 
Eighth grade. 190 1251 3,757 | 78 One year of high school 670 42.7 | 21,087 41.3 Two years of high school. - 260 16.5 | 9,769 19.1 ‘Three years of high school. 9 26 304 6 Complete high-school course. 28.1 16, 165 31.7 
sbotalsseres fa scece oda 100.0 0 | 51, 082 | 100. 
  
When the educational requirement for admission is low, i. e., the 
eighth grade or one year of high school, the percentage of schools 
exceeds the corresponding percentage of pupils, and when this re- 
quirement is high, i. e., two years of high-school work or a full high- 
school course, the percentage of pupils exceeds the corresponding 
percentage of schools. To state this condition in averages, it is found 
that schools requiring the completion of the eighth grade for admis- 
sion have an average enrollment of 19 pupils; those requiring one 
year of high school for admission, 31 pupils; those requiring two 
years of high school for admission, 37 pupils; and those requiring a 
full high-school course for admission, 37 pupils. Thus it is seen that 
the larger schools on an average have the higher requirements for 
admission. Combining the schools requiring only the completion of 
the eighth grade or one year of high school for admission and the 
pupils enrolled in these schools, and also adding the schools requiring 
two years of high-school work or a full high-school course for admis- 
sion and the corresponding pupils enrolled in these schools, it is found 
that the average enrollment in the former group is only 29, as against 
37 in the latter. In other words, the schools with high admission 
requirements are more than 27 per cent larger than those with low 
requirements. This condition implies that schools having high edu- 
cational requirements for admission enroll more than the average 
number of pupils. Therefore, it may be said that the larger schools 
generally have the higher educational requirements for admission. 
In training schools in hospitals for insane patients it is found that 
the schools requiring an eighth-grade course for admission aggregate 
54 per cent of the total number of schools reporting, but they enroll
-P-A-G-E-591
  NURSE TRAINING SCHOOLS, 1918, 591 
only 48.3 per cent of the nurse pupils, while the schools requiring a 
one-year high-school education for admission aggregate 39.5 per cent 
of the total and enroll 46.4 per cent of the nurse pupils. Considering 
only the two larger groups of schools, i. e., those requiring the com- 
pletion of the eighth grade or of one year of high school for admission, 
it is found that schools having the former requirement enroll on an 
average only 34 nurse pupils, whereas schools having the latter 
requirement enroll 45 nurse pupils. It is seen, therefore, that the 
schools requiring one year of high-school work for admission are 32 
per cent larger than those requiring only an eighth grade for admis- 
sion. It is evident, also, as in the case of the general hospitals, 
that the larger schools generally have the higher educational require- 
ment for admission. In other words, smaller schools must generally 
maintain lower educational entrance requirements to secure a suffi- 
cient number of nurse pupils to care for their patients, while the 
larger hospitals offering exceptional and varied facilities for profes- 
sional training can maintain higher educational standards for admis- 
sion and still secure asufficient number of pupils to carry on the 
work of the hospital. 
RELATION BETWEEN LENGTH OF COURSE AND ENTRANCE 
REQUIREMENT. 
An inspection of Table 14 reveals the fact that only the schools 
appearing in the first five general groups made a complete report on 
the educational entrance requirement, the length of the course in 
years, and the number of nurse pupils enrolled. These statistics for 
these 1,640 schools for both general hospitals and hospitals for the 
insane are shown graphically in figure 11 for several specific purposes: 
First, to show the number and percentage of schools having the 
various requirements for admission, as indicated by the cross-lined 
bars. The “pins” inclosed in these bars represent the percentage of 
students who have presumably met these requirements. This distri- 
bution of schools and pupils according to the requirement for admis- 
sion has been discussed above, where every school making a report on 
its educational entrance requirement, as indicated in Table 14, was 
added to make a complete summary which would be ‘comparable to 
the corresponding statistics for 1911. 
Second, to show that the larger pone generally have the higher 
entrance requirements since the “ pins’ ” proj ject beyond the cross-lined 
bars for schools in general hospitals requiring a two-year high-school 
or a full high-school coursé for admission and for schools in hospitals 
for the insane requiring two years of high school work for admission, 
both of which tendencies have been pointed out above for all schools 
which give, as shown in Table 14, both the educational requirement 
for admission and their enrollment. :

  NURSE TRAINING SCHOOLS, 1918, 593 
Third, to show graphically by means of the last group of bars, ‘Total 
of all groups above,’’ just how many schools offer courses varying 
from less than one year to four years in length. Almost nine times 
as many schools offer a three-year course as offer a two-year course 
in general hospitals, and about one and one-half times as many in 
schools in hospitals for the insane offer a three-year as offer a two- 
year course. This situation has been indicated for all schools re- 
porting the length of course offered, as shown in Table 14, and the 
data were compared with corresponding data for 1911. 
Fourth, to show that the larger schools generally have the longer 
course of three years. This condition was pointed out in the dis- 
cussion of Table 14, wherein all schools reporting both the length 
of course and the enrollment are assembled. In figure 11 this 
situation is shown graphically. By reference to the last group of 
bars, ‘‘Total of all groups above,” it will be seen that the ‘‘pins” 
project beyond the open bars only in bars representing schools hav- 
ing a three-year course, indicating that these schools enroll more 
pupil nurses on an average than do schools offering only a two-year 
course. : 
Fifth, to show that the schools having high requirements for 
admission more generally offer the longer course. By comparing 
the lengths of the two bars in figure 11 representing two and three 
year courses in general hospitals under the different subdivisions for 
the respective requirements for admission, it will be observed that 
the three-year bar is over four times as long as the two-year bar in 
the first group, representing schools having the eighth grade require- 
ment for admission; overseven times as long in the second group, repre- 
senting schools with the requirement.of one year of high school work 
for admission; nearly twelve times as long in the third group, repre- 
senting schools with the requirement of two years of high school work 
for admission; and over fifteen times as long in the fifth group, repre- 
senting schools with the requirement of a full high-school course for 
admission. The schools in the fourth group requiring three years 
of high school work for admission are omitted from this comparison 
since only 9 schools have this requirement. Thus it will be seen 
that the higher the minimum requirement for admission the greater 
the proportion of schools offering a three-year course. In other 
words, more than three times as great a proportion of nurse training 
schools in general hospitals having the minimum requirement of a 
full high-school course for admission offer a three-year course as 
do schools having only the eighth grade requirements for admission, 
By making similar comparison for the bars representing hospitals 
for the insane, it will be noted that the same situation prevails. 
Since practically all schools of this type require only an eighth grade 
or one year of high school for admission the few schools having a 
59872°—21-—--38
-P-A-G-E-594
  594 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
higher requirement should not be considered, as they are so few in 
number that they are not representative of these higher groups. 
Where only an eighth-grade education is required for admission, 
about two-thirds as many schools give a three-year as give a two- 
year course, while four times as many schools requiring one year of 
high school for admission give a three-year as give a two-year course. 
This reversal in the relative lengths of the two and three year bars 
clearly implies that the higher the educational requirement for 
admission the longer the course offered in hospitals for the treat- 
ment of the insane. To state this relationship numerically, over 
six times as great a proportion of nurse training schools in hospitals 
for the insane, having as a minimum requirement for admission 
one year of high-school work, offer a three-year course as do schools 
with the lower requirement of an eighth-grade education for admis- 
sion. 
NURSE TRAINING SCHOOLS AFFILIATED WITH COLLEGES AND 
UNIVERSITIES. 
One of the very essential features of an efficient nurse training 
course is that adequate facilities be available for giving the pre- 
liminary academic instruction incident to such a course. A few 
schools meet this problem by a carefully planned course given within 
the hospital, but frequently nurse training schools have no regular 
instructors and no available laboratory properly equipped for im- 
parting the academic instruction so essential to every well organized 
course. Often the instruction is left entirely to the superintendent 
of nurses, and not infrequently to some of the more mature pupils in 
training. Frequently the laboratory is not well enough equipped 
to give the instructor, either physician, paid instructor, superintend- 
ent of nurses, or nurse pupil, an opportunity to present the pre- 
liminary instruction in the most efficient manner. Many nurse 
training schoois have solved this difficulty by having regular college 
or university instructors, usually in the school of medicine, give these 
general science courses to the nurse pupil in training. Wherever 
such an arrangement exists the hospital which maintains the nurse 
training school is affiliated with the college or university. A de- 
cided advantage accrues to the training school from this affiliation, 
since the teaching is left entirely to specialists who are not only 
thoroughly familiar with their special work but who are also profes- 
sionally trained for presenting the instruction in the most effective 
manner, and since a well equipped laboratory is always at the dis- 
posal of the instructor. By this plan the academic training is placed 
on a college basis, and collegiate credit is generally given for it, 
thereby tending to elevate and dignify the professional training of 
nurses. The following colleges and universities offer nurse training

courses of the character just described. Only those institutions 
have been included in which nurse training courses have been made

    648 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
NUMBER OF SCHOOLS REPORTING. 
This report, for 1917-18, includes the statistics of 62 schools for the 
blind. In addition to these, 9 other such schools, known to be in 
existence, did not submit a report. The list of institutions not report- 
ing this year follows. By including these schools this chapter serves 
as a complete directory of schools for the blind. 
Arkansas School for the Blind, Little Rock, Ark. 
Florida School for the Deaf and Blind (both white and colored), St. aa Fla. 
Georgia Academy for the Blind (colored only), Macon, Ga. 
Louisiana State School for the Blind, Baton Rouge, Ta. 
Tennessee School for the Blind (colored only), Nashville, Tenn. 
Virginia State School for Colored Deaf and Blind Children, Newport News, Va. 
Racine Day School for the Blind, Racine, Wis. 
Catholic Institute for the Blind, One hundred and seventy-fifth Street and Univer- 
sity Avenue, New York City. 
NUMBER OF SCHOOLS FOR THE BLIND.

ee °. 
1900) 
  The Institution for the Deaf, Blind, and Orphans (colored only) at 
Taft, Okla., has had thus far no blind pupils to report. 
The Austine Institution for the Deaf and Blind, Brattleboro, Vt., 
no longer admits blind pupils and is not properly included in this 
chapter. 
The highest number of schools reporting in any year was in 1913, 
when 64 schools were represented. The increase from 41 schools in 
1909 to 64 schools in 1913 is very pronounced. The decrease since 
the latter date is due to the failure of certain institutions to report 
and not to an actual decrease in the number of such schools, as will 
be noted from the list of delinquent schools given above. 
 
-P-A-G-E-649
    
SCHOOLS AND CLASSES FOR THE BLIND, 1917-18. 649 
DUAL SCHOOLS. 
Thirteen of the 62 schools reporting in 1918 are dual schools, i. e., 
they are schools for both deaf and blind. These schools, therefore, 
will appear again in the chapter on ‘Schools for the deaf,” wherein 
the statistics relating to all schools for the deaf will be found. 
Altogether, 14 States provide for such dual schools, viz, Alabama 
(colored only), California, Colorado, Florida (both white and colored), 
Idaho, Maryland (colored only), Montana, Oklahoma (colored only), 
North Carolina (colored only), South Carolina (both white and 
colored), Texas (colored only), Utah, Virginia (both white and 
colored), and West Virginia. As explained in a preceding paragraph, 
the dual schools in Florida and Oklahoma (colored only) are not 
represented in the statistics of this report. 
In addition to the 13 dual schools represented herein, there are 
2 other schools of this character which did not report in 1918. They 
are listed in the first paragraph of this chapter. So far as the reports 
indicate, all dual schools are State institutions. 
CONTROL. 
Ten of the schools for the blind included in this report are main- 
tained as a part of the city public school system and are located as 
follows: Chicago, Ill.; Detroit, Mich.; Jersey City, N. J.; Newark, 
N. J; New York City; Cincinnati, Cleveland, Mansfield, and Toledo, 
Ohio; and Milwaukee, Wis. Four schools are under private control 
or management: St. Joseph’s Asylum for Blind Girls, Prince Bay, 
N. Y.; the International Sunshine Society, Summit, N. J., and 
Brooklyn, N. Y.; New York Institute for the Education of the Blind 
(412 Ninth Avenue), New York City; and Brooklyn Home for Blind, 
Crippled, and Defective Children, Port Jefferson, N. Y. The Perkins 
Institution and Massachusetts School for the Blind, Watertown, 
Mass., is under private control but receives State aid. All other 
schools listed in this chapter in the detailed statistical tables are 
State institutions. INSTRUCTORS. 
The number of instructors in schools and classes for the blind has 
increased almost steadily since 1900, from 437 at that time to 728 
in 1918, or an increase of over 66 per cent within this period. The 
curve representing the total number of instructors is governed very 
largely by the curve in figure 1, which represents the number of schools 
reporting. Despite the fact that fewer schools have reported since 
1918, the number of instructors has continued to increase. The 
largest number reported in any year was 728, in 1918. 
The majority of the teachers in schools for the blind are women. 
In 1900 the men numbered about half as many as the women. In 
1918 over 72 per cent of all teachers in these schools were women.

  SCHOOLS AND CLASSES FOR THE BLIND, 1917-18, 651 
NUMBER OF PUPILS. 
The number of pupils in schools and classes for the blind in 1918 
was 5,386. In 18 years, as shown in figure 3, the number of pupils 
has increased from 4,021 to 5,386, or over 31 per cent. The “total” 
curve in this figure follows in general the same course as that shown 
in figure 1, representing the number of schools. 
In a preceding paragraph it was shown that the number of teachers 
increased 66 per cent within this same period of 18 years. These 
percentages imply that teachers are not obliged to instruct so many 
pupils at present as they did several years ago. The average num- 
ber of pupils per teacher in 1900 was 9, as against 7 in 1918. 
The number of boys slightly exceeds the number of girls in schools 
for the blind. This difference has been practically the same since 
1900, as shown in figure 3, indicating that the data within this period 
have been remarkably consistent.

  GRADUATES. 
The data on the number of graduates prior to 1910 are not very 
reliable, since the blank used in collecting this information did not 
specify that only graduates from the secondary school should be 
reported. This indefiniteness in the question accounts for the zigzag 
nature of the curve in figure 4 prior to that date. In general, since
-P-A-G-E-652
652 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
1910 the number of graduates has increased. The relatively high 
numbers, 111 and 119, respectively, reported in 1912 and 1913, are 
due largely to the high points in the curve in figure 1 representing 
these years, when an unusual number of schools reported. The 
number of graduates has been about equally divided between boys and 
girls. The interweaving of the curves representing boys and girls 
in figure 4 is probably due to the small number of graduates reported 
annually. 
ENROLLMENT BY GRADES. 
The distribution of pupils by grade groups is shown in ‘Table 3. 
In the kindergarten, 498 pupils were enrolled; in grades 1 to 4, 2,138 
pupils; in grades 5 to 8, 1,614 pupils; and in classes corresponding 
to the high-school grades, 1,005 pupils. Only 2 of the 62 schools 
reporting did not make this distribution by grade groups. Of the 
5,245 pupils represented in this distribution, 9 per cent were in kin- 
dergartens, 41 per cent in grades 1 to 4, 31 per cent in grades 5 to 8, 
and 19 per cent in high school. About one-fifth of those in high 
schools graduated. One-half the pupils are below the fifth grade 
and the other half are in the fifth grade or above. 
ENROLLMENT BY COURSES OF STUDY. 
The number of pupils enrolled in the different courses of study in 
schools and classes for the blind are represented graphically in figure 5. 
The number reported in 1918 was 3,164. Of this number, 1,686 
pupils were boys and 1,478 girls. Since 1900 the curve for the 
number of pupils in industrial or trade training courses has stood 
above the curves for the enrollment in music courses. The trend of 
this curve follows that in figure 1, showing that the enrollment in 
trade courses is proportional to the number of schools reporting. 
The highest number of pupils in these courses was reported in 1914, 
when the greatest number of schools reported. The decided drop 
in 1918 is probably due to war conditions. Presumably most of the 
trade courses are taught by men, and the draft would necessarily 
deplete the male teaching force. Further, there was a special demand 
for men who could teach trade-training courses. In corresponding 
courses in the other chapters of this Biennial Survey a decrease is 
shown for 1918. 
‘The number enrolled in music courses is also: shown in figure 5. 
In general the number in instrumental music exceeds the number in 
vocal culture. A decided drop in the number in vocal culture is 
noted in 1910 and a decided increase in 1914, which are both probably 
due to erroneous reports. In general these two curves do not rise 
so rapidly as the upper curve for enrollment in trade courses. This 
tendency indicates that increased emphasis is placed on industrial 
work.

  VALUE OF PROPERTY. 
Altogether, 54 schools reported the value of property as follows: 
Buildings and grounds, $11,586,064; apparatus, furniture, library, 
etc., $1,378,231; permanent endowment or productive funds, 
$3,306,964. In 1915-16, 48 schools reported for these items 
$10,152,802, $916,426, and $3,590,278, respectively. A slight decrease 
in productive funds is shown. The 6 additional schools reporting 
the value of property in 1918 may account largely for the increased 
value of buildings and grounds and for apparatus, etc. Assuming 
that the 8 schools not reporting the value of property in 1918 had 
the average value of $214,557 for buildings and grounds, and 
$25,523 for apparatus, etc., the total value of the former item for the 
62 schools reporting would be $13,302,520 and for the latter item,
-P-A-G-E-654
654 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
$1,582,415. These amounts are probably high, since city schools 
for the blind usually do not report the value of property, inasmuch 
as separate buildings for blind pupils are seldom provided.

  SCHOOLS AND CLASSES FOR THE BLIND, 1917-18, 655- 
VOLUMES IN LIBRARIES. 
In schools for the blind two kinds of libraries are usually found, 
one with books in raised type and the other with books printed in 
ink. The statistics on the number of volumes in libraries are not 
very reliable, since dual schools sometimes reported the number of 
volumes printed in ink with the library used by the department for 
the deaf, and since often a school reported the total number of 
volumes interchangeably, under one nomenclature or the other. 
As shown in Table 1 the data on the number of volumes in ink vary 
considerably from year to year, being the lowest in 1910, when 
34,754 volumes were reported, and highest in 1916, when 60,622 
volumes were reported. The number of volumes in raised type 
shows a more stable tendency, rising almost steadily from 88,493 
volumes in 1907 to 149,621 volumes in 1918. The data on libraries 
previous to 1907 do not distinguish between these two types. The 
totals for each year more nearly represent the general tendency to 
increase the number of volumes. In Table 5 it will be noted that 
in several instances the library statistics in dual schools have been 
included in the chapter on schools for the deaf, thereby decreasing 
correspondingly the number of volumes reported in this chapter. 
The average total number of volumes in the libraries of the 48 schools 
reporting is 4,270. 
HOW THE STATES PROVIDE FOR THE EDUCATION OF THEIR BLIND. 
An index as to the interest manifested by a State in educating 
its blind is the per capita investment for each blind person in its 
institutions. In figure 6 it is seen that Indiana has property valued 
at $8,615 for each person in its school for the blind. Kansas ranks 
second, with a per capita valuation of $5,379. The corresponding 
average per capita for the United States is $2,669. In the construc- 
tion of this figure, only those schools were used that reported both 
the valuation of property and the total enrollment for the year. 
A State having large schools necessarily has a lower per capita valua- 
tion than a State with a small school, where the per capita cost of 
housing, etc., is necessarily high. This fact must be considered in 
judging a State near the bottom of the list. The data on which 
figure 6 is based are shown in Table 2. In the case of dual schools 
the valuation of property has been prorated between deaf and blind 
in proportion to the enrollment in each as shown in the detailed 
tables of this chapter. 
It should be remembered that the schools included in the construc- 
tion of this figure are not all State institutions. The school repre- 
senting New Jersey is a private school. Only one of the four schools 
for New York is a State institution. In all other instances the 
State is represented by State institutions.
-P-A-G-E-656
  - 656 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, ‘1916-1918, 
RECEIPTS. 
Tn all, 49 schools for the blind reported their receipts aggregating 
$2,385,049, or an average of $48,674 per school. Of this total, 
$2,304,278 was itemized as follows: $1,724,969, or about 75 per cent, 
came from public funds; $89,101, or over 4 per cent, from private 
benefactions; $267,336, or over 11 per cent, from endowment funds; 
and $222,872, or almost 10 per cent, from other sources. The sig- 
nificant implication of these data is that about three-fourths of the 
income of all schools for the blind comes from public sources, usually 
from the State. 
Thirteen schools represented in this report did not give a statement 
of their income. If these schools each received the average indicated 
above, the total receipts of all 62 schools reporting would be $3,017,811. 
This total is only a gross estimate and should be used with caution. 
The schools not submitting any report whatever for 1917-18 have not 
been considered in estimating this total. 
EXPENDITURES. 
Altogether, 52 schools for the blind reported their expenditures, 
amounting to $2,459,252, or an average of $47,293 per school. - Of 
this amount $2,404,169 was itemized by function as follows: For 
buildings and other lasting improvements, $393,032, or over 16 per 
cent; for teachers’ salaries, books, etc., $547,663, or almost 23 per 
cent; and for other salaries and all other current expenses, $1,463,474, 
or about 61 percent. If the average for the 10 schools not reporting 
expenditures was the same as that for those reporting, the total 
expenditures for the 62 schools represented in this report would be 
$2,932,182. This amount is almost equal to the estimated total 
receipts for the same schools given above, viz, $3,017,811. This 
comparatively slight difference signifies that these totals are essen- 
tially correct. The validity of these estimates is further supported 
by the fact that receipts usually exceed expenditures. : 
Figure 7 shows the amount of money spent in 1918 on each person © 
in schools for the blind in the different States represented. The States 
are arranged in the order of the per capita cost for current expenses. 
Montana spent $1,178 for each person for current expenses and $556 
additional for buildings, sites, or other permanent improvements. 
Maine ranks second witha per capita of $865, and Massachusetts 
’ third with a per capita cost of $845. The corresponding per capita 
amount going for current expenses for the United States is $428 and 
for outlays $82. This graph is a good index as to the importance 
which a State attaches to the education of its blind. In the case of 
dual schools the expenditures have been prorated between deaf and 
blind in proportion to the enrollment in each type of school as shown 
in Table 6.

  It should be kept in mind in reading this figure that New Jersey is 
represented by a private school and two city schools for the blind; 
New York by one State, one city, and three private schools; and 
Ohio by one State and two city schools. It is altogether proper, 
however, to include these municipal and private schools in ranking 
the States, since it is evident that these city and private schools are 
patronized by State pupils, and, therefore, reduce the responsibility 
of the State in providing for these blind pupils in a State institution. 
All the private schools represented in this report receive public funds 
and usually pupils are admitted at the request of some State officer. 
They serve, therefore, in several ways as State schools and are properly 
included in the graph.

  CHAPTER VIII. 
SCHOOLS FOR THE DEAF, 1917-18. 
ContEeNnts.—Types of schools included—Dual schools—Schools not reporting—Number of schools—Instruc- 
tors—Pupils—Enrollment by grades—Graduates—Pupils taught speech—Volumes in libraries—Valu- 
ation of property—Receipts—Expenditures—Statistical tables. 
TYPES OF SCHOOLS INCLUDED. 
From an administrative viewpoint three types of schools for the 
deaf are included in this chapter: First, those controlled and sup- 
ported by the State; second, those controlled and financed by private 
organizations; and, third, those operated as a part of the city public 
school systems. This latter type is referred to herein as city day 
schools, since children attend them during school hours generally and 
are not housed in dormitories as is usually the cage in State and pri- 
vate institutions. These three types of schools are kept separate 
and distinct throughout the chapter. All States, except Delaware, 
Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Wyoming have State 
schools for the deaf. Some of the schools in Massachusetts, New 
York, and Pennsylvania included with the State schools are only 
semipublic, i. e., they are partly controlled by private organizations 
but serve as State institutions, receiving pupils at public expense. 
Some of these schools admit pupils at public expense from other 
States than the one in which the school is located. 
DUAL SCHOOLS. 
Altogether, 13 dual State schools are included in this report. The 
Florida State School for the Deaf and Blind (both white and colored 
departments), St. Augustine, and the Virginia State School for Col- 
ored Deaf and Blind, Newport News, did not report. Altogether, 
there are 15 dual schools in 14 different States. South Carolina and 
Virginia each provide two dual schools, one for white and the other 
for colored youth. In Florida, white and colored pupils are taught 
in different departments of the same school. Dual schools are limited 
to State institutions. For a more detailed discussion of this type of 
school, see the chapter on schools for the blind. :

670 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
SCHOOLS NOT REPORTING. 
  In addition to the two dual schools mentioned above, five other 
Schools for the deaf did not report in 1918. They are given here so 
that this publication may form a complete directory of such schools 
throughout the United States: 
_ St. Joseph’s Deaf-Mute Institute, St. Louis, Mo. 
The Davidson School of Individual Instruction, Tamworth, N. H. 
New Mexico Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, Santa Fe, N. Mex. 
Reno Margulies School for the Deaf, New York, N. Y. 
Racine Day School for the Deaf, Racine, Wis.

NUMBER OF SCHOOLS. 
As will be observed in figure 1, the total number of schools report- 
ing in 1918 was 155. Of this number, 68 are State or semi-State 
institutions, 69 are city day schools, and 18 are private schools. The 
highest number of schools reporting in any year was in 1916, when 
159 reports were received. The decrease this year is due to the 
failure of a few schools to report and not to an actual decrease in the 
total number of schools throughout the United States. The number 
of State and private schools for the deaf since 1900 has remained 
practically the same. The increase in the number of such schools 
has been due very largely to the formation of city day-school classes 
for the deaf. The number has increased from 41 in 1900 to 71 in 1916 
and to 69 in 1918. The number of private schools was about the
-P-A-G-E-672
  672 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, ° 
same in 1918 as it was in 1900. At no time within this period did 
the number exceed 20. The number of State schools increases 
slowly but steadily. It is evident that the drop in the total curve 
in figure 1 from 1907 to 1911 is due to the failure of a number of city 
day schools to report, since a corresponding synchronous fluctuation 
is observed in the “long-dash”’ curve representing these schools and 
classes as is shown in the “total” curve. The number of schools 
reporting has a marked influence on the summarized data. For 
example, note the corresponding drops in 1908 in figure 1, repre-

The deviation from the line of tendency in any year is due more 
generally to incompleteness of reports than to any other single factor. 
A truer condition would be presented if lines should be drawn con- 
necting only the highest points in the figures. | 
INSTRUCTORS, 
Since 1900 the number of instructors in schools for the deaf has 
increased from 1,184 to 1,821, or 54 per cent, as shown in figure 2. 
The number of men instructors has remained practically constant,
-P-A-G-E-673
  SCHOOLS FOR THE DEAF, 1917-18, 673 
the corresponding increase being from 366 to 410 within this period 
of 18 years. The greater proportion of the increase has been in the 
number of women teachers. In 1900 there were 818 and in 1918 
1,411 women teachers in schools for the deaf. The increase within 
this period has been over 72 per cent. 
The teaching “load” in these schools has lessened within the 
period under consideration. In 1900 the average number of pupils 
per teacher was 9.3. In 1918 the corresponding average was only 
7.9. These figures indicate that the teaching “load’’ has been

  decreased about 15 per cent within a period of 18 years. This means 
that teachers have greater opportunity for giving individual instruc- 
tion. It is an index of increasing efficiency. 
The number of pupils per teacher is largest in city day-school 
classes and smallest in private schools. The average number of 
pupils per teacher in the former in 1918 was 7.7 and in the latter 5.2. 
The corresponding average in State schools is 8.2. It is evident, 
therefore, that larger numbers of pupils are taught by a teacher in 
State schools for the deaf than in city or private institutions. More 
individual attention is evidently given to pupils in private than in 
either State or city schools.

  674 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
PUPILS. 
A rather unexpected situation is revealed by figure 3. A very 
large proportion of the pupils in schools for the deaf is found in 
State institutions; of the 14,442 pupils reported in 1918, 11,316, or 78 
per cent, were enrolled in State institutions; in 1900 the corresponding 
ratio was 89 per cent. While the actual number of pupils in State 
institutions has steadily increased, these schools are enrolling a smaller 
and smaller proportion of all such pupils. The reason is found in the 
increasing importance of city day school classes for the deaf. The 
enrollment in these classes has increased from 749 in 1900 to 2,482 in 
1918. It has increased 231 per cent within this period. The num- 
ber of pupils enrolled in private schools, not serving as State institu- 
tions, has not materially increased within this period. The very 
rapid rise in the upper curve in figure 3 does not indicate that the num- 
ber of deaf persons in the population has increased so rapidly, but 
that a greater interest is manifested by States and cities in the educa- 
tion of the deaf and consequently that a greater proportion of deaf 
persons are enrolled in school. 
ENROLLMENT BY GRADES. 
By assembling the data on enrollment by grade-groups found in 
the summary tables the following distribution is obtained:

This summary does not include the total enrollment in all schools 
for the deaf, since several schools did not make a complete distribu- 
tion of their total enrollment. The percentages in the last column 
show very accurately, however, the relative proportion of pupils in 
the different grade-groups. Over one-half of the enrollment is found 
in grades 1 to 4, inclusive. Less than one-twentieth of it is found in 
high-school grades, about one-ninth in kindergartens, and over one- 
fourth in grades 5 to 8, inclusive. City schools have relatively small 
percentages of deaf pupils in kindergartens and in high schools. Pri- 
vate schools have relatively a high percentage of pupils in kinder- 
gartens, but below the average percentage in high schools.

-GRADUATES. 
Prior to 1911 the blank on which the statistics were collected did 
not specify that only graduates from secondary schools should be 
reported. Consequently, many schools reported the number com- 
pleting the elementary as well as the secondary course as shown in 
Table 1. Since 1911 a more stable increase in the number graduating 
from secondary schools is shown, as will be noted in figure 4. Prac- 
tically all graduates are found in State institutions, indicating that 
city boards of education have not generally provided secondary 
schools for deaf children. In fact only five cities reported pupils in 
high-school grades. The reports show that 28 State institutions have 
548 pupils enrolled in high-school classes. Altogether, there are en- 
rolled in high-school classes of five city schools for the deaf only 30 
pupils, and in four private schools only 22 pupils. Of these numbers, 
206, 5, and 3 pupils graduated from State, city, and private schools, 
respectively. The number of graduates from city and private sec- 
ondary schools for the deaf has been almost negligible, as shown in 
figure 4. 
PUPILS TAUGHT SPEECH. 
The following table shows the number of pupils in each type of 
school who were taught speech during the year.

Of the 14,442 pupils enrolled in schools for the deaf, 10,757, or 74 
per cent, were taught speech during the year. In all three types of 
schools combined, 9,699 pupils were taught by the oral method, i. e., 
they were taught to speak and to understand the speech of others by 
lip reading or speech reading. Only 435 pupils were taught by the 
auricular method, which consists in attempting to improve the hearing 
of those not absolutely deaf. 
VOLUMES IN LIBRARIES. 
As shown in Tables 5, 8, and 11, the total number of volumes in the 
libraries of schools for the deaf is 144,281 volumes in State institu- 
tions, 2,225 volumes in private schools, and 7,153 volumes in city day 
schools. In the case of three dual State schools the number of vol- 
umes given in the detailed tables includes the number of volumes 
(printed in ink) in schools for the blind. On the other hand, the

library in another school of this type has been reported with schools 
for the blind. The total number of volumes reported in all schools 
for the deaf is 153,659, or an average of 1,652 volumes per school re- 
porting this information. This average in State institutions is 2,531 
volumes; in private schools, only 318 volumes; and in city day schools, 
247 volumes. It should be remembered, however, that other libraries 
are also accessible to children enrolled in city schools for the deaf. 
The library facilities in private schools are not nearly so adequate as 
those in State institutions. 
VALUATION OF PROPERTY.

the valuation of the property reported for each type of school rep- 
resented:

Only 5 State schools did not report the value of buildings and 
grounds, and 15 did not give the value of apparatus, ete. Assuming 
that each State school not reporting had the same average value of 
property as those reporting, viz, $289,948 for buildings and grounds 
and $29,839 for apparatus, etc., the total value of the former for the 
68 institutions represented in this report would be $19,716,494 and of 
the latter $2,029,056. In the case of dual State schools, the valuation 
of property has been prorated between schools for the blind and deaf 
in proportion to the enrollment in each. The total valuation of prop- 
erty in private schools and in city day schools can not be estimated 
with any degree of accuracy, since so few schools of each type repor- 
ted this information. In the case of city schools for the deaf, a part 
of the regular public school buildings is often used as classrooms for 
the deaf. Consequently few of these schools could supply the data 
desired. : 
Altogether, 13 schools reported a total endowment of $1,934,166. 
The greater part of this belongs to State or semi-State schools.

A good index as to how well a State provides for its deaf is found in 
the valuation of property for each one enrolled in its schools for the 
deaf. A great variation obtains in this respect, as will be noted from 
figure 5. The District of Columbia, ranking highest, has an average 
per capita of $6,296; while West Virginia, ranking lowest, has an 
average per capita value of only $402. Arizona, with a per capita of 
$132, rents the buildings used by its school for the deaf. The average 
per capita for the United States is $1,791 for State or semi-State insti- 
tutions and $1,218 for private schools. California and the District of 
Columbia seem to form a separate class in the investments which they 
have made for deaf pupils. The next highest State, Indiana, has only 
about three-fifths the per capita value shown for California and only 
about one-half that shown for the District of Columbia. Little infor- 
mation would be derived from attempting to show the per capita value 
of property in city schools for the deaf, since so few cities report the 
valuation of property. 
RECEIPTS. 
The receipts of city day schools for the deaf are inseparably bound 
up with the total receipts of city public schools.. So few city schools 
for the deaf reported receipts that it was not thought advisable to 
tabulate the returns.

1 Part of this amount was not itemized as to source. 
In State schools almost 90 per cent of the revenue comes from 
public sources, and in private schools over half the revenue comes 
from private benefactions and productive funds. In private schools 
almost 40 per cent comes from other sources, most of it presumably 
. from tuition fees. In State or semi-State schools only 5 per cent of 
the revenue comes from private benefactions or productive endow- 
ment. 
Only 59 State schools reported receipts, the total being $4,494,484, 
or an average of $76,177 per school. If each of the 9 State schools 
 
-P-A-G-E-681
SCHOOLS FOR THE DEAF, 1917-18, 681 
not reporting receipts received the same average amount, the total 
receipts for State schools would be $5,180,077. This estimate for 
State schools does not take into account the 3 State schools which 
submitted no report whatever. Not even a gross estimate is possible 
in case of private schools, since only 8 out of 18 reported their receipts. 
EXPENDITURES. 
Altogether 61 State schools for the deaf reported expenditures, the 
aggregate amount reported being $4,292,789, or an average of $70,378 
per school. If the other 8 State schools not reporting incurred the 
same average expenses, the total amount spent by the 68 State schools 
reporting in 1918 would be $4,855,822, which is almost as much as 
the estimated total receipts for the same schools, viz, $5,180,077. 
The total amount spent by the 8 private schools reporting was 
$102,990, or an-average of $12,874 per school. The unusual amount 
of $42,682 spent for buildings by one private institution has materially 
increased this average. Omitting this one relatively large school 
from consideration, the average expenditure in the other 7 schools 
is only $5,525.

In State schools about one-tenth of the total expenditures are made 
for outlays. In private schools the expenditures for the same purpose 
were unusual in 1918. In State schools about three-tenths of the 
expense is incurred for instruction. In both types of schools the 
expenditures made for “other salaries and other current expenses” 
are about double the amount spent for teachers’ salaries, books, etc., 
i. e. for instruction. Presumably, the greater portion of this large 
group of expenditures is incurred because pupils are housed and 
boarded in the school dormitories. 
Only 49 city day schools for the deaf reported their expenditures. 
Usually, financial accounts for such schools are not kept by the 
teacher or principal, but by the superintendent or the board of educa- 
tion. Table 17 shows the amount spent by each of the 49 cities 
reporting. The total amount spent for all purposes was $294,952, 
or an average cost of $195 per pupil enrolled. Assuming that this
-P-A-G-E-682
- 682 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
average applies to all pupils enrolled in such schools, viz, 2,482 pupils, 
the total cost of maintaining all city day schools for the deaf would 
be $483,990. The total amount spent for instruction, usually for 
teachers’ salaries, was $215,330, or an average of $1,080 per teacher. 
This average represents rather accurately the average salaries of 
teachers in city day schools for the deaf. It may be slightly too 
high, since it includes both the salary of the teacher and other ex- 
penses of instruction, such as books, pencils, paper, etc. In many 
instances the round numbers given in Table 17 indicate that only 
the teachers’ salaries were reported under this item of expenditure 
(column 4). 
The per capita expenditures in schools for the deaf is shown graphi- 
cally by States in figure 6. Montana ranks highest both in the total 
expense incurred, $1,734, and in the amount spent for current ex- 
penses, $1,178. The District of Columbia ranks second, with a per 
capita current expense of $713. Texas had the smallest per capita for 
current expenses, $139. The average per capita for current expenses 
for the United States is $358, and for outlays, $41. The correspond- 
ing averages for the United States for private schools are $238 and 
$225, respectively. 
The “open” portion of the bars represent per capita expenditures 
for buildings and other lasting improvements. This item will vary 
considerably from year to year for the various States, and conse- 
quently is not considered in ranking the States. It is shown addition- 
ally to indicate the total per capita expense incurred by any State 
for the year considered. Where the open bar is long, the State 
represented evidently incurred an unusual expense for permanent 
improvements. In the case of dual schools the expenditures have 
been prorated between deaf and blind schools in proportion to the 
number of pupils in each type of school.

SCHOOLS AND CLASSES FOR FEEBLE-MINDED AND 
SUBNORMAL CHILDREN. 
ConTENTS.—Types of schools represented—Number of schools reporting—Instructors—Assistants—En- 
rollment in schools and classes for feeble-minded and subnormal children—W hat children in schools 
and classes for the feeble-minded and subnormal study—Pupils per teacher—Per capita valuation 
of property in schools for the feeble-minded—Per capita cost in schools for the feeble-minded. 
TYPES OF SCHOOLS REPRESENTED. 
With regard to administration three types of schools for mentally 
defective children are represented in this report, viz, State institu- 
tions, private institutions, and city day schools. The State insti- 
tutions reporting are distributed among 31 States. In addition to 
these, two other States, Maryland and South Dakota, maintain, each, 
a school for the feeble-minded, but no report on, the statistics of these 
schools was received for the school year 1917-18. These State insti- 
tutions receive and care for those who are mentally defective, but not 
insane nor juvenile criminals. No statistics were collected as to the 
type of inmates admitted to these institutions, but the catalogues of 
many of them indicate that most of the inmates are children, a few 
institutions admitting older persons. The private institutions are 
generally very similar to the State institutions, and the statistics of 
these two types of schools are more or less comparable. The city day 
schools are controlled by city boards of education and constitute a 
part of the city school system. Adults are not admitted to these 
schools and classes. Throughout this report these schools have been 
designated as city day schools, this term being preferable to the 
designation ‘‘public day schools,” used in former reports, since the 
State institutions are also public. Children attend these schools only 
during the day and are not furnished with board and lodging as are 
the children in State and private institutions. 
A further distinction much more significant than these should be 
pointed out, viz, that the children in city day schools are usually 
retarded or backward school children who have been placed in special 
classes for special teaching and direction. These classes are usually 
designated ‘‘special classes,” “opportunity classes,” ‘‘exceptional 
classes,” ‘“‘ungraded classes,” or ‘‘classes for defective children.” 
In only four instances are these schools professedly for feeble-minded 
children. Usually, children in city day schools are able to take care 
of themselves, and no ‘‘attendants” are necessary. In general, 
707
-P-A-G-E-708
  708 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
these children have a much higher type of mentality than do inmates 
in State and private institutions. For these reasons, it is doubtful 
whether the statistics of city day schools should be treated with, or 
should be compared with, the statistics of schools for the feeble- 
minded. These three types of schools have been treated separately 
where any advantage would be gained by so doing. In many of the 
graphic illustrations, however, the three types of schools have been 
skown correlatively, both to make comparisons and to economize 
space in presentation. 
NUMBER OF SCHOOLS REPORTING. 
This year (1918) the statistics show a total of 206 schools or classes 
for the mentally defective. About one-half of these, or 131, were

  classes in city day schools, 43 were State institutions, and 32 were pri- 
vate institutions. In figure 1 and Table 1 comparative statistics for 
these types of schools are shown. Since 1900 the number of State 
institutions reporting has increased from 19 to 48, and the number of 
private schools from 10 to 32. No data on special classes in city day 
schools for retarded or subnormal children were collected prior to 
1918. - Since that date the number of cities making special provision 
for these subnormal children has increased from 52 to 131. The very 
rapid rise in the curve representing these city day schools indicates
-P-A-G-E-709
  
FEEBLE-MINDED AND SUBNORMAL CHILDREN. 709 
the unusual interest manifested by city superintendents and city 
boards of education in caring for the subnormal children in their 
schools. For the sake of promoting the organization of city day 
schools for subnormal children, the State of Minnesota allows $100 
for each child enrolled in such schools. 
The increase in the total number of schools for mental defectives 
since 1900 does not show that a greater percentage of children are 
becoming mentally defective from year to year, but rather indicates 
a growing interest on the part of cities, States, and private organi- 
zations. in making provision for this unfortunate class of mentally

curve in 1913 is due, of course, to the inclusion of the piace of 
city day schools for subnormal children.

The same general fluctuations are found in the curve representing 
the teaching force as shown in figure 2 as were indicated in figure 1 
for the total number of schools reporting. A very abrupt rise is 
evident in 1913, since in that year city day schools were asked for 
the first time to submit a report. Figure 2 shows, also, the number

-P-A-G-E-712
  712 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
of men and women teachers composing the total. In 1918, out of 
1,680 teachers in schools and classes for the feeble-minded, 92 per 
cent were women and only 8 per cent were men. In 1912, the last 
year in which only the statistics of State and private institutions 
were included, out of a total of 424 teachers 82 per cent were women. 
It is apparent, therefore, that very few teachers in the city day 
schools are men, since the percentage of women teachers has in- 
creased from 82 per cent to 92 per cent of the total since that date. 
_ As shown by the curves, the number of men teachers has increased 
from 78 in 1912 to 135 in 1918, or 73 per cent, while the number of 
women teachers has increased from 346 to 1,545, or 347 per cent, 
during the same period. This very rapid increase in the upper curve 
is due almost wholly, therefore, to the number of women teachers 
employed in city day schools to give instruction to backward and 
subnormal children. With the rapid multiplication of city day- 
school classes for subnormal children, as shown in figure 1, and 
with corresponding increase in the number of instructors employed, 
as shown in figure 2, an increasing need for teachers who are specially 
qualified in methods of teaching and in abnormal psychology is 
foreshadowed. 
It is evident, also, that specially trained mental diagnosticians 
will be necessary to make careful classifications of children who 
ordinarily attend the public schools. A classification of children 
according to mental rather than physical age is undoubtedly coming. 
ASSISTANTS. 
Assistants in schools for the feeble-minded do not give instruction 
but usually devote their time to caring for the inmates. Accordingly, 
they are usually employed in State and private institutions rather 
than in city day schools. The curves in figure 3 indicate as much, 
since no abrupt rise is evident in 1913 such as was shown in both 
figure 1 and figure 2. The “‘total” curve shows a gradual rise from 
1900 to 1918, with no unusual jump in any year. War conditions 
may have caused the drop in 1918. In 1918 over 71 per cent of 
these assistants were women, while in 1907 only 67 per cent were 
women. ‘These percentages indicate a tendency on the part of in- 
stitutions for the feeble-minded to employ women rather than men 
as assistants. 
ENROLLMENT IN SCHOOLS AND CLASSES FOR FEEBLE-MINDED AND 
SUBNORMAL CHILDREN. 
The impression inferred from figure 1 concerning the number of 
schools reporting might lead one to believe that about one-half as 
many inmates were enrolled in private as were enrolled in State 
institutions, since the curve for the latter is about twice as far from 
 
-P-A-G-E-713
  
FEEBLE-MINDED AND SUBNORMAL CHILDREN. 713 
the base line as that representing private schools. Most of the 
private schools are small schools, as will be seen from figure 4. For 
example, 32 private schools enrolled only 983 inmates in 1918, or 
about 31 to each school on an average. The 43 State institutions 
enrolled 35,968 inmates, or about 836 inmates in each institution on 
an average. In other words, State schools for the feeble-minded 
usually have about 27 times as many inmates as private schools of

  the same class. The total number of pupils enrolled in the 131 city 
day schools for backward and subnormal children in 1918 was 18,133, 
or an average of 138 to each city. It is seen in figure 4 that the 
curve for inmates in State schools stands above the corresponding 
curves for city day schools and private schools. 
Since 1900 the number of inmates in State schools has increased 
267 per cent, and in private institutions only 131 percent. The organ- 
ization of city day-school classes for subnormal children has caused 
an increase of 93 per cent in the enrollment in these classes since
-P-A-G-E-714
  714 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
1913. It should be remembered that these large percentages of 
increase do not necessarily mean that society is becoming burdened 
with unusually increasing percentages of feeble-minded and sub- 
normal children, but rather indicate that provision is being made 
for the education and care of children who in years gone by had 
little opportunity for education. When these children found that 
they could not do the regular school work required of them, they

  usually dropped out of school and no further account was taken 
of them. With the advent of scientific mental tests a larger per- 
centage of children are placed in classes or schools for retarded and 
backward children, thereby promoting greater efficiency in the 
schools from which they are withdrawn and enabling the retarded 
children themselves to receive the type of instruction best suited to 
their peculiar needs. Those who can not profit materially from 
these special classes in city school systems are usually sent to State 
institutions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-715
  FEEBLE-MINDED AND SUBNORMAL CHILDREN. 15 
It should be added that the total enrollment in State and private © 
institutions, as shown in figure 4, includes ail inmates on the roll of 
these institutions during the year. The numbers include, therefore, 
those not enrolled in the school classes as well as those who were 
enrolled in such classes, or who were learning a trade. 
By reference to Table 6 a significant relationship between the rela- 
tive number of boys and girls is shown. Of the total enrollment in 
city day school classes for backward and subnormal children, only 
34 per cent are girls and almost 66 per cent are boys. In other words, 
there are almost twice as many boys as girls in these city day schools. 
In the State and private institutions the boys and girls are about 
equally divided. No data are available by which to explain this very 
great inequality in the relative number of boys and girls in city day 
schools for subnormal children. Usually mental tests when properly 
given do not reveal such great differences in mental ability of boys 
and girls. It can not be determined from the data at hand whether 
such schools enroll an unusually high percentage of incorrigible, 
indolent, indifferent, or truant, rather than mentally defective, boys, 
whether there exists a certain hesitancy in assigning girls to classes 
for subnormal children, or whether actual differences in mental 
attributes of the two sexes exist. Accurate methods of determining 
the mental characteristics of the two sexes will probably show that 
the last-named inference is without foundation. 
WHAT CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS AND CLASSES FOR THE FEEBLE-MINDED 
AND SUBNORMAL STUDY. 
Figure 5 shows, graphically, what children in schools and classes 
for the feeble-minded and subnormal study. In State schools the 
greatest number of inmates take work in home economics while 
almost as many are enrolled in manual training courses. Approxi- 
mately, 4,000 children in these schools are enrolled in music, agricul- 
ture, and trade training courses. In private schools music leads 
with an enrollment of 426 pupils and manual training ranks second 
with 337 pupils. A few pupils are taught agriculture and almost 
none are enrolled in trade training courses. In city day schools 
music and manual training are the leading subjects taught, each study 
enrolling approximately 16,000 pupils. Home economies ranks 
third with an enrollment of nearly 5,000 pupils. Relatively few 
children in these schools are taught agriculture or trade training. 
It is of greater interest to compare the types of training offered by 
these three classes of schools or institutions. In city day schools 
90 per cent of the pupils are taught music; in State institutions only 
11 per cent; in private schools 43 per cent. Home economics is 
taught to 26 per cent of the children in State institutions; to 27 per 
cent of the children in city day schools, and to 24 per cent of the
-P-A-G-E-716
  716 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
pupils in private schools. Manual training is taught to 86 per cent 
of the children in city day schools; to only 19 per cent of the inmates 
in State institutions, and to 34 per cent of the pupils in private 
schools. It should be remarked that a large number of girls is en- 
rolled in classes in manual training in city day schools for backward 
and subnormal children. In all three of these types of schools about 
the same percentage of the pupils is taught agriculture, viz, 11 per 
cent in State institutions, 10 per cent in city day schools, and 14 per 
cent in private schools. State institutions teach trade subjects to 
13 per cent of their inmates, city day schools to 12 per cent of their

  pupils, and private schools to only 4 per cent of their pupils. It is 
seen, therefore, that the widest divergence in the subjects taught by 
these three types of institutions occurs in music and manual training, 
the city day schools emphasizing these subjects very greatly and the 
State institutions giving little attention to them. 
PUPILS PER TEACHER. 
In figure 6 a comparison has been arranged to show the relative 
number of pupils per teacher in the three types of schools and classes 
for feeble-minded and subnormal children. The most common 
number of children to each teacher in city day schools is from 15 to 
19, inclusive, 49 cities having this average. The most common
-P-A-G-E-717

number in State institutions is from 10 to 14, inclusive, 12 insti- 
tutions reporting this average. The most common number in 
private schools is less than 5, 16 schools having this low average. It

  would seem from these comparisons an 
schools should be comparatively good.     from a knowledge of defect- 
ive children attending the three kinds of schools, that opportunities 
for effective care and teaching of very defective children in private 
It is not probable that the
-P-A-G-E-718
  718 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
children in private schools are of lower mental ability and more difficult 
to teach than those in the State institutions. It is to be expected 
that the number of pupils per teacher would be higher in city day 
schools than in either State institutions or in private schools, since 
the children in such schools are very slightly subnormal and very 
seldom fall in the classes with idiots or imbeciles so frequently found 
in State and private institutions, and consequently they do not need so 
much individual attention. 
Considerable deviation from the usual number of pupils per teacher 
is found for each type of school. In the group 20 to 24 are found 2 
private schools. Altogether, 15 State institutions have 25 or more 
pupils to each teacher employed. In all, 6 city day schools have 30 
or more pupils to each teacher employed. The unusually high aver- 
ages in these extreme instances are not indicative of the highest 
grade of efficiency in instruction. One State at least (New Jersey) 
_has passed a law limiting the size of classes for subnormal children to 
15 pupils each. The result of such legislation enables teachers to give 
more personal attention to the individual needs of each subnormal 
child in her charge.

PER CAPITA VALUATION OF PROPERTY IN SCHOOLS FOR THE FEEBLE- 
MINDED. 
It is difficult to secure from the cities maintaining special schools 
for subnormal children a statement concerning either the valuation 
of property or the current expenditures for the maintenance for such 
schools. Often a separate building is not used and separate accounts 
for expenditures are not kept. Consequently no attempt has been 
made in this chapter to secure such data for incorporation herein. 
Table 2 shows by States, for both State and private institutions, the 
total enrollment, the total valuation of property, and the per capita 
value for each inmate therein. This table measures the degree to 
which each State maintaining a school for the feeble-minded has 
provided for this unfortunate class of persons. The measure is not 
strictly correct, however, since the per capita value necessarily de- 
creases with the increase in the size of the schools. In other words, 
a large school with a low per capita investment, say $400, may offer 
as good an opportunity to those committed to its care as a smaller 
school with a per capita investment of $500 or $600. 
The data in Table 2 are shown graphically in figure 7. It will be 
noted that the State of Montana has an investment of $1,907 for each 
child committed to its school for the feeble-minded. Wyoming 
ranks second and Maine third. Possibly the long and severe winters 
in these three Northern States may necessitate correspondingly larger 
investments to insure equal facilities to those offered in other States 
farther south. The average investment for all of the States com- 
bined is $813. Ten States have a higher average than this and 15 
States a lower average. ; 
The average investment by States in private institutions is only a 
little less, $787. A greater variation exists among the private in- 
stitutions than among the State institutions, as indicated by the very 
unequal length of the open ‘‘bars.”” New Jersey ranks first on this 
score, having an average per capita investment of $2,584 per child in 
three private schools reporting. As Tennessee and Texas have no 
State institutions for the feeble-minded, and the one State school in 
California did not report all the items entering into this comparison, 
no black bars for these States appear on the graph. 
The heavy vertical line drawn at the extremity of the black ‘‘aver- 
age” bar for the United States enables each State to determine its 
location with reference to this average. Any State falling very far 
short of this average is in a ‘“‘danger zone’’ and may not be making 
proper provision for its feeble-minded.

PER CAPITA COST IN SCHOOLS FOR THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
The per capita cost of maintaining State and private schools for 
the feeble-minded is shown by States in Table 3 and figure 8. Only 
those schools have been included which report both the total enroll- 
ment and the current expenses. Where an additional expenditure 
has been incurred for new sites, buildings, etc. (outlays), the amount 
has been inserted both in the table and in the figure. Colorado ranks 
first in the per capita amount expended for current expenses or main- _ 
tenance. Current expenses rather than total expenses have been 
used in determining the order of precedence since the former remains 
practically the same from year to year, while the total expenses, 
which may include outlays, varies annually with unusual expendi- 
tures for buildings and sites. Five States would rank ahead of Colo- 
rado if the total expenses were used as a basis of ranking. North 
Carolina, North Dakota, Montana, and Oregon, each, have almost as 
large a per capita current expense as Colorado.

The average per capita expenditure for all State institutions for 
feeble-minded is $209. The vertical broken line at the end of the 
black bar, representing this average, facilitates a ready comparison 
between the per capita expenditures incurred by any State and the

average amount. Fourteen States expend a greater amount than the 
average, and only eleven States a smaller amount. 
The average amount spent for each child in private schools is much 
greater than the per capita expenditures in State institutions, the 
former being $473 as against $209 in the latter. This situation 
might have been anticipated from figure 6, which indicated that the 
number of pupils per instructor in private schools was much smaller

than the average number to each teacher in State institutions or in 
city day schools, thereby necessarily increasing the per capita cost 
of maintenance in private schools. The very large per capita expen- 
diture of $1,281 shown for two private schools in New Jersey is 
accounted for by the fact that in one school the children are taken 
each summer to Maine, thereby increasing the actual cost of main- 
tenance and adding the cost of transportation to and from this sum- 
mer home. 
The greatest per capita expenditure for outlays was incurred by the 
State of Maine, aggregating $349. Several States had no capital 
outlays in 1918.

    CHAPTER X. 
INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS FOR DELINQUENTS, 1917-18. 
ConTENTS.—Schools reporting—Nomenclature—Size of schools—Inmates—Teachers—Parentage of 
inmates—Illiteracy—Valuation of property per inmate—Receipts—Total Expenditures—Endow- 
ment funds, 
After the statistical report found in Volume II, 1917, Report of 
the Commissioner of Education, containing statistics for the year 
1915-16, had been prepared, the Bureau of Education adopted the 
plan of collecting statistics biennially instead of annually, as had been 
done in preceding years. Consequently, in this chapter no historical 
statistics for 1916-17 willappear in the comparative studies. Further, 
corresponding statistics for the year 1918-19 will not be solicited. 
For most purposes biennial statistics will suffice, since fairly accu- 
rate interpolations can be made for the years not represented in 
the reports. As only slight changes appear in thesestatistics from year 
to year, a biennial report will answer most inquiries satisfactorily.

  746 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
SCHOOLS REPORTING. 
As most schools of this type are established by legislative enact- 
ment, a very large annual increase in the number of schools report- 
ing is not to be expected. In Table 1 the number of schools reporting 
each year since 1900 is shown. These data are shown graphically in 
figure 1. It will be observed that the number reporting has increased 
from 80 in 1900 to 135 in 1918, representing an increase of 69 per 
cent. The curve falls below the regular “line of tendency” in 1908, 
1913, 1914, and 1915. These drops are probably due to inability 
to secure reports from all schools. In preceding years no record 
has been kept of the number of institutions not reporting. This 
year, as will be found in Table 8, the number of schools not report- 
ing, as well as the number reporting, has been shown. According 
to the records which are revised regularly by the Bureau of Edu- 
cation, there are 159 public and private industrial schools for delin- 
quents in the United States. Of this number, 135 submitted at 
least a partial report and 24 did not report. These statistics are fairly 
representative of the group, inasmuch as almost 85 per cent of such 
schools are included. The detailed table includes the names of the 
schools not responding as well as the names of those reporting. This 
arrangement is desirable, since no attempt is made annually to in- 
clude the list in the Educational Directory published by this bureau. 
NOMENCLATURE. 
The schools whose reports are included in this chapter have been 
designated heretofore as State industrial schools. They are all, 
however, reformatory institutions for delinquents receiving inmates 
committed by juvenile or other court decision. The designation 
“State industrial schools” is a misnomer, since 31 schools listed in 
the detailed tables following are private institutions controlled by 
corporations or associations, but they admit children committed by 
public authority and receive public appropriations to care for these 
children. A small number of city and county industrial schools 
for delinquents are also included in the detailed tables following. 
It is thought advisable, therefore, to change the title of this chapter 
from that of ‘‘State industrial schools” to that of ‘‘ Industrial schools 
for delinquents.” The lists of private, county, and city schools are 
given below:

It is of interest to compare the ‘‘size”’ or enrollment of the 134 
industrial schools for delinquents reporting such data. It will be

found in figure 2 that 17 schools have an enrollment less than 100, 
and one school has over 2,500. The most common size is from 100 
to 199—25 schools falling in this group. About as many schools, 23, 
fall in the next higher group. From an analysis of the data used in 
the construction of this graph, it was found that as many schools 
had an enrollment less than 304 as had an enrollment greater than 
this number. The “median” school in the array had, therefore, 
an enrollment of 304 inmates. Approximately one-fourth, or 33

schools, have an enrollment of 160 or less, and an equal number have 
an enrollment of 713 or more. In other words, about half the in- 
dustrial schools for delinquents have an enrollment from 165 to 
689, inclusive. The average enrollment for all schools reporting is 493. 
INMATES. 
The number of inmates has increased much more rapidly than 
would be indicated by the increase in the number of schools reporting. 
As will be noted in figure 3, the total number of inmates on the roll
-P-A-G-E-749
  
INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS FOR DELINQUENTS, 1917-18. 749 
of industrial schools for delinquents has increased from 23,901 in 
1900 to 63,762 in 1918, or an increase of 167 per cent. This very large 
increase of inmates in reformatory institutions would be an exaggera- 
tion, if a smaller percentage of institutions reported in 1900 than did 
in 1918. This inference, however, is probably not true, as the curve 
shows a gradual rise, indicated more clearly by the “‘moving average’’ 
in the figure. The method used in determining the location of this 
“average” is shown in Table 1. Its use is to eliminate the fluctua- 
tions in the original curve due to the negligence of a few schools to 
submit a report. It shows a gradual rise from the beginning to the 
end of the period considered. Any decided irregularity in the total

percentage of inmates reported would tend to show a greater devia- 
tion from the moving average than appears in any year. Since the 
‘average line” shows remarkable regularity in its incline, it must be 
assumed that approximately the same percentage of the total number 
of inmates has been reported each year, and consequently there must 
have been the very large increase of 167 per cent as shown above. 
The “total” curve has been ‘‘broken up”’ to show the number of 
boys and girls in industrial schools for delinquents. These curves 
show in general the same fluctuations as are shown in the total, indi- 
cating that the relative number of boys and girls is about the same 
each year.

1 Divide the enrollment for each year by the average enrollment. 2 Fstimated, $ This is the sum of the index numbers from 1900 to 1904, inclusive, ete. 
To show this relativity and divergence more clearly it is necessary 
to reduce the enrollment to index numbers. Table 2 shows the 
method used in securing the index numbers used in plotting the 
curves in figure 4. The average number of boys for the 18 years 
considered was 35,334. This average is divided into the number of 
boys on the roll each year. The quotients are the indices given in 
column 4 and are used in locating the curve for boys in figure 4. In 
a similar manner the curve for girls is determined. So great are the 
irregularities in these two index curves that it becomes necessary 
to compute a moving average for each. The method of computation 
is shown in Table 2. Consider, for example, the interval between 
1916 and 1918. The moving average for the girls shows a steeper 
slope than the one for the boys, indicating that the percentage of 
increase for the girls was greater than that for the boys during this 
interval. In other words, the increase in the number of girls in an 
“average” institution may have been from 50 to 60, or 20 per cent, 
while the increase in the number of boys in an ‘‘average’’ institution 
may have been from 100 to 105, or 5 per cent, only one-fourth as 
much as in the case of the girls. Because one curve is above another 
does not indicate that the upper curve shows the greater increase. 
Between 1902 and 1903 the upper curve shows a decrease, while the 
lower one shows an increase. It will be seen, therefore, that the 
relative slope or steepness of the curves between any two consecutive 
intervals indicates the relative rate of change. In general, the two  
-P-A-G-E-751
  
  INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS FOR DELINQUENTS, 1917-18, TBL 
moving averages show the same sfope until 1915, where a tendency 
to diverge is evident, the average for girls rising the more rapidly. 
Whether the ‘‘breaking down” of home life is responsible for the 
increase in the number of delinquent girls within the past few years 
one can not judge from the curves. In general, a slight tendency 
in this direction has been evident since 1904, but did not become 
pronounced until 1915. It must be remembered, however, that 78 
per cent of all inmates in 1918 were boys. In other words, there 
were more than three times as many boys as girls in reformatory 
institutions. Consequently, the apparent tendency noted above need 
not be alarming.

  Fria. 4.—Relative rates of increase in the number of boys and girls in industrial schools for delinquents, 
since 1900. 
The very large increase in the total number of children committed 
from year to year may be partly due to any one of four factors—a 
tendency on the part of courts to construe the laws more rigidly, 
the enactment of more stringent laws or of laws having wider appli- 
cation, the organization of a more vigilant police force, or a ‘‘breaking 
down”’ in the control of children in the home and school. In short, 
either more children are ‘‘caught”’ or our methods of building charac- 
ter are becoming more ineffective. 
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF AVERAGE ENROLLMENT. 
In Table 12 it will be noted that the average enrollment in 130 
schools for the year was 26,721 boys and 9,270 girls, or a total of 
35,991. This total is only 58 per cent of the total number of inmates
-P-A-G-E-752
  752 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF) EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
on the rolls of these same industrial schools for delinquents during 
the year. This percentage seems to indicate that the average child 
remains in a reformatory institution only 58 per cent of a year, or 
~ almost 212 days. Of course, some inmates remain for a longer period 
and others for a shorter period, but the average period is only 212 
days. The fact that some inmates are counted in the enrollment 
for two consecutive years does not vitiate this deduction, since pre- 
sumably the same ratio would hold for two successive years. 
The ‘‘average enrollment”’ also indicates approximately the num- 
ber found in industrial schools for delinquents at any one time. 
INMATES COMMITTED AND DISCHARGED. 
During the year 22,498 boys and 5,525 girls, or 28,023 children, 
were committed to reformatory institutions, and 20,969 boys and 
4,714 girls, or 25,683 children, were discharged. Altogether, 134 
schools reported the number committed and 129 the number dis- 
charged. Five schools, not reporting the number discharged, 
reported the number committed as 959. One school reported 
neither the number committed nor the number discharged. Deduct- 
ing these numbers respectively from the total numbers committed 
and discharged, it is found that 27,064 inmates were committed and 
25,683 discharged from the 129 institutions reporting this informa- 
tion. The number committed, therefore, exceeded the number dis- 
charged by 1,381, or by 5.4 per cent. This was to be expected in 
view of the fact that the total number of inmates has increased 
annually—as shown above in Table 1 and figure 3. No attempt was 
made to ascertain the number of inmates on parole.

INMATES AND POPULATION. 
It is desirable to show whether the rate of increase in the number of 
inmates in industrial schools for delinquents has been proportional to 
the increase in the total population 5 to 18 years. It is difficult to 
make these comparisons graphically, since the quantities to be com- 
pared are so unequal numerically. In 1918 there were only 24 inmates 
in industrial schools for delinquents out of every 10,000 children be- 
tween 5 and 18 years of age. In other words one curve would be 
about 400 times as far from the base line as the other. Consequently, 
the numbers representing the total population and inmates have been 
reduced to indices as shown in Table 4, thus facilitating a convenient 
method of showing rates of increase as shown graphically in figure 5. 
To eliminate irregularities in the curve for inmates, a moving average 
has been applied the computation of which is given in Table 3. 
Throughout the period under consideration, 1900 to 1918, a more rapid 
rise is shown for the number of inmates than for the corresponding 
population. The moving average is steeper throughout the entire in- 
terval than the index curve for the population. This figure furnishes 
additional evidence that a larger and larger proportion of children are 
committed each year to reformatory institutions than would be indi- 
cated by the more stable increases in population. 
WHITE AND COLORED INMATES. 
The number of white and of colored inmates in industrial schools 
for delinquents since 1900 is shown in figure 6. The number of 
white inmates has increased from 20,278 in 1900 to 54,610 in 1918, 
or an increase of almost 170 per cent, while the number of colored 
inmates has increased from 2,695 to 8,479, or 215 per cent in the same 
period. One school, in Indiana, admitting colored youth as well as 
white, enrolling 673 inmates, did not report white and colored sepa- 
rately. Consequently, the total number of white and of colored as 
shown in the graph lacks 673 of making the total of 63,762 enrolled 
in all institutions. According to the Federal Census of 1910, in 
Indiana 1.9 per cent of the population was colored. Assuming that 
this ratio holds for the number of inmates in reform schools, it is 
estimated that 13 inmates in the Indiana school are colored. Apply- 
ing this correction to the totals in the graph the estimated number 
of white children in reform schools is 55,270 and the number of 
colored, 8,492. Assuming that these figures are essentially correct, 
it is found that the number of whites has increased 173 per cent and 
the number of colored 215 per cent since 1900. These percentages 
are more nearly correct than the corresponding percentages given 
above. It is evident, therefore, that there has been a greater increase 
in the number of colored than of white inmates in industrial schools 
for delinquents within the last 18 years. 
This inequality in relative increases can not be attributed to a 
more rapid increase in the colored than in the white population of the
-P-A-G-E-755

country, since this condition does not prevail. Between 1900 and 
1910 the percentage of increase in the white population was 22.3 and 
in the colored population only 11.2 per cent. These percentages, 
therefore, show that the conclusion drawn above is valid. 
In 1910 the number of colored children 5 to 19 years, inclusive, in 
the United States constituted 12.4 per cent of the population of 
corresponding ages. The estimated number of colored children in

industrial schools for delinquents as shown above is 8,492, or 13.3 
per cent of the total number of inmates. In other words if the 
population percentage for 1910 holds in 1918, the number of colored 
children in these schools is over 7 per cent more than would be 
indicated by the number of colored children in the population. 
Briefly stated, there is a slightly larger proportion of colored than of 
white children in reformatory institutions.

  INDEX CURVES FOR WHITE AND COLORED INMATES. 
A more thorough analysis showing the relative rates of increase 
of white and colored inmates is made possible by the index curves 
shown in figure 7. The method used in locating the index curve is 
the same as that used in determining similar curves shown in figures 
4 and 5. The moving averages are also computed in the same 
manner as explained for the moving averages in those figures. The 
exact data and the method of securing the data used in the con- 
struction of figure 7 are given in Table 4. It was necessary to 
compute the moving averages for this figure so as to eliminate the 
irregularities in the index curves due to variation in the number of 
schools reporting each year. Consider, for example, the interval from ” 
1903 to 1904. The moving average for the whites during this period 
shows a more rapid rise- than is indicated by the moving average 
for the colored inmates. In other words, the curve for the white is 
steeper than that for the colored inmates during this interval. The 
fact that the curve for the colored inmates is superior to that for 
white inmates indicates nothing. Only the relative slopes show 
relative rates of increase. If the last points for 1918 on each 
index curve had been located by numbers representing a complete 
distribution of the total enrollment between white and colored, the 
moving average for white between 1917 and 1918 would show a 
   
-P-A-G-E-757
INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS FOR DELINQUENTS, 1917-18. 757 
slightly lower drop than appears, the index being 146 instead of 144. 
In general, therefore, since 1914 the curve for colored inmates has 
risen more rapidly than the one for white inmates. This means of 
course, that in recent years the increases in the number of colored 
inmates has been greater than that for white inmates. It was 
pointed out above that since 1900 the number of colored inmates 
has increased more rapidly than the number of white inmates. 
This fact, however, need not be alarming since the moving averages 
show about the same relative slopes throughout. These deductions

+ should be borne in mind that the ‘‘moving average” does not 
epresent actual accurate figures, but only indicates trends, and for 
his reason is probably more accurate than either index curves or 
aphs showing actual figures, since both of these contain fluctuations 
ue to variation in the percentage of schools reporting annually. 
INMATES IN SCHOOL CLASSES AND LEARNING SOME TRADE. 
The total number of inmates, and the enrollment in school classes 
r in trade courses, are shown in figure 8. The statistics for 1907 
nd 1908 are not comparable with the statistics for other years, as
-P-A-G-E-758
  
758 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
will be noted from the unusual drop in the curves at these periods. 
The curve for the enrollment in school classes has been rectified 
since the schools in these years reported ‘‘average enrollment in the 
school classes.”’ In the case of the other two lines no rectification is 
warranted, since the reports do not state that ‘‘ averages” were asked 
for. Undoubtedly, many schools reported only the average, since 
the numbers assumed to be in the school classes during these years 
exceed the actual enrollment. This drop is not wholly due, how- 
ever, to inaccurate reports, but also to the failure of many schools 
to report in 1907 and 1908, as will be evident from figure 1. The

total number of inmates has increased 167 per cent, the enrollmen 
in school classes 140 per cent, and the number learning some trad 
172 per cent since 1900. 
These percentages show that the relative number in school classe: 
has not kept pace with the increase in total enrollment and that th 
number learning a trade has increased in greater proportion th: 
the total number of inmates. The falling off of the enrollment i 
trade classes in 1918 may be due to war conditions. The numbe 
in school classes actually increased between 1916 and 1918, in abou 
the same proportion as the corresponding increase in the tot 
enrolment.

\ 
By means of the index curves shown in figure 9 the rates of change 
in enrollment between any two consecutive intervals becomes 
readily apparent. For instance, in 1918 the steepest slope is shown 
for the ‘‘total enrollment” curve, the next steepest slope for the 
curve representing enrollment in school classes. The “‘reversed”’ 
or ‘‘negative” slope representing the number learning some trade 
indicates an actual decrease. Possibly the decreases in enrollment 
in trade courses may be due to the fact that many men teachers 
were drafted into the Army. The three curves in general show 
remarkable similarity in slopes throughout the period 1900 to 1918, 
indicating about the same relative increase annually in the number 
in the school classes or who are learning some trade. The method 
used in constructing these index curves is shown in Table 5,

It should be remarked that 81 per cent of all inmates reported 
in 1918 were enrolled in the school classes, and 68 per cent were 
learning a trade, as shown in Table 1. Since 1900 the average per- 
centage enrolled in school classes is 85, and learning some trade 69. 
The slight falling off from this average in 1918 may be due to war 
conditions. These percentages contain slight errors, as some insti- 
tutions reporting total enrollment do not report enrollment in school 
classes or the number learning some trade. In the summary table 
(11) only those institutions reporting all these data have been in- 
cluded. It is found that 83 per cent of all inmates are enrolled in 
school classes and 75 per cent of all are learning some trade. These 
are only slightly higher (2 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively) 
than the corresponding figures given above. These differences,
-P-A-G-E-760
  760 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
however, indicate that approximately the same percentage should 
be added, respectively, to the average obtained for the period 1900 
to 1918. If this is done it is found that on an “‘average’’ about 87 
per cent of all inmates are enrolled in school classes and 76 per cent 
are learning a trade in industrial schools for delinquents. These 
percentages are essentially correct, since allowance has been made 
for institutions not reporting. 
TEACHERS. 
By reference to figure 10 it will be noted that the number of teach- 
ers has increased from 538 in 1900 to 1,137 in 1918, or an increase of 
111 per cent. This increase has not been so marked as the increase 
in the number of inmates, 167 per cent. A more detailed discussion 
of these relative increases will be given below, in connection with 
figure 12. In brief, it may be said that in 18 years the number of 
inmates in industrial schools for delinquents has almost been tripled, 
while the corresponding number of teachers has been only a little 
more than doubled. The moving average shows more accurately 
the general trend than does the irregular curve representing the 
absolute numbers. The method used in computing this average is 
shown in Table 1. 
In comparing the relative numbers of men and women teachers, 
the numbers for the years 1907 and 1908 can not be considered, since 
they represent only the “average”? number of teachers employed 
during the year. From 1909 to 1918 there has been only a slight 
increase in the teaching force. It will be noted that approximately 
the same relative number of men and women are employed from 
year to year—the number of women exceeding the number of men. 
Tn fact, in 1918, about 58 per cent of the teachers were women and 
42 per cent were men. The slight decrease in the number of men 
teachers may be incident to the draft. This decrease in the male 
teaching force in 1918 may cause the decrease in the number of 
inmates learning some trade, as shown in figures 8 and 9, since most 
trades are presumably taught by men. 
On the blank used in collecting the statistics for this report the 
“number of assistants caring for inmates not included as teachers” 
was secured. Figure 11 shows the corresponding statistics since 
1900. Within this period an increase of 125 per cent is shown. 
This percentage is higher than the corresponding increase of 111 per 
cent in the number of teachers, but lower than that for total inmates, 
167 per cent. These percentages indicate that the number of per- 
sons teaching and caring for inmates in industrial schools for delin- 
quents has not been increased in proportion to the number of inmates 
committed. Combining the figures for teachers and assistants, it is 
found that there has been an increase of 121 per cent since 1900, as 
compared with an increase of 167 per cent in the number of inmates.

  762 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
The average number of inmates for each year from 1900 to 1918 is 
44,566, and the average number of teachers and assistants combined 
is 3,473. The average number of inmates under the “entire charge”’ 
of each teacher and assistant is 12.8. In other words the average 
“load” since 1900 is 12.8. This “load” has increased from 11.3 
in 1900 to 13.7 in 1918. The actual average increase in the load has 
been 2.4 within this period, or an increase of 21 per cent. To state 
this significance clearly in different words, teachers are obliged 
in 1918 to teach 6 pupils where they instructed only 5 in 1900, and 
assistants are obliged to care for 6 inmates in 1918 where they 
cared for only 5 in 1900.. This extra burden thrust upon teachers 
is even greater than the ratio of 6 to 5 given above indicates, since 
the increase in number of teachers has not been so great as that of 
assistants, as shown above. It was thought advisable, in arriving 
at the deduction made above, to combine the data on teachers and 
assistants, since it is not always possible for institutions to make an 
exact distribution of employees when reporting.

The index curves given in figure 12 show in detail the relative rate 
of increase in the number of inmates, teachers, and assistants. The 
relative slope of the curves between any two consecutive dates 
indicates the approximate rates of increase. Thus between 1916 and 
1918 the curves for inmates and assistants show about the same 
slope, and therefore about the same rate of increase. The curve for 
teachers shows a negative slope, and therefore an actual decrease. 
The number of teachers increased very rapidly from 1900 to 1910, 
much more rapidly than the number of assistants, but in general 
not quite so rapidly as the number of inmates, since the curve repre-

senting the latter begins at a lower point in 1900 and ends at a higher 
point in 1910. From 1908 to 1910 the ‘‘inmate’’ curve shows a 
veryrapidrise. Themethod used in determining the location of these 
curves is shown in Table 6, and of course, is the same as that used 
in computing similar graphs used above. By means of index numbers 
curves are placed near together in such a way as to facilitate ready 
comparisons.

PARENTAGE OF INMATES. 
In figure 13 an analysis has been made of the parentage of inmates, 
boys and girls. As only 56 schools made a complete and accurate 
distribution of their total enrollment under the classification shown 
in the graph and in Table 10, the figure is based upon the data 
in Table 10 rather than upon Table 9, which is comparable to the 
corresponding statistics tabulated in preceding years, and which 
has been retained in the report only for this reason. It will be noted 
from the graph that 89. 5 per cent of the inmates are American born

and 10.5 per cent foreign born. In other words, only one child in 
10 in industrial schools for delinquents is foreign born. Also 59.7 
per cent of all American-born inmates have both parents American, 
and 7.9 per cent, have one parent American, and 21.9 per cent 
have both parents foreign born. Combining the foreign-born inmates 
with those American born, having both parents foreign born, it is 
found that about 3 children out of every 10 in industrial schools for 
delinquents are either foreign born or have foreign-born parents. 
By comparing the number of boys and girls in each group it is 
found that for all inmates there are 51 boys to every 10 girls (5.1); 
for all American-born inmates, 50 boys to every 10 girls (5.0); for 
inmates with both parents American-born, 47 boys to every 10 girls 
(4.7); for all inmates of mixed parentage, 34 boys to every 10 girls 
(3.4); for inmates having both parents foreign born, 74 boys to every 
10 girls (7.4); and for all inmates foreign born, 56 boys to every 10 
girls (5.6). It is noted that the ratio between boys and girls is 
highest where the foreign-born element enters and lowest in the 
mixed parentage group. These statistics show that a larger percent- 
age of American girls of American or mixed parentage get into reform 
schools than do foreign-born girls with both parents foreign born. 
Conversely, a higher percentage of ‘‘foreign’’ boys than ‘‘American’’ 
boys are committed. This situation is a very difficult one to unravel, 
and one can only conjecture an explanation. Possibly, ‘‘foreign’’ 
girls are kept under closer home supervision than are American girls. 
On the other hand, a larger percentage of ‘‘foreign’’? boys than of 
“‘American’’ boys may spend their time on the streets and become 
subject to unusual temptations. The ‘‘foreign’’ child does not 
always understand our customs and laws, and, consequently, may 
more often meet with friction from peace officers than do American 
children. Many means have been provided for the employment, 
amusement, or recreation of “American” children which are not 
open socially to the ‘‘foreign’’ child. The low ratio shown between 
boys and girls of mixed parentage may not be conclusive, as only 
7.9 per cent of all children inreformatory institutions fallin this group. 
The high ratio between boys and girls in the ‘‘foreign’’ groups 
can not be attributed wholly to the inequality of boys and girls in 
the population. From the Federal Census of 1910 it is found that 
there are only 106 foreign-born boys to every 100 foreign-born girls 
from 5 to 19 years, inclusive. This slight difference does not account 
for the high ratio of 5.6 shown in the graph. If the total foreign-born 
population is considered, it is found that there are 129 males to 100 
females, but these figures are not comparable with those for boys 
and girls in industrial schools for delinquents. According to the 
census of 1910 the relative number of boys and girls 5 to 19, inclu- 
sive, having foreign-born parents, was 100 boys to 100 girls. It 
can be seen, therefore, that inequality in the distribution by sexes

does not account for the high ratio of 7.4 shown in the fifth group of 
bars. The difference in the ratio, therefore, in the third column of 
figures in the graph can not be explained on the unequal distribution 
of the sexes from 5 to 19 years, inclusive. 
PARENTAGE OF INMATES COMPARED WITH THE TOTAL POPULATION 
5 TO 19 YEARS, INCLUSIVE. 
By reference to figure 14 it will be noted that 95.2 per cent of all 
children 5 to 19, inclusive, in our population are American-born, and 
that 89.5 per cent of the children in 56 reformatory institutions are 
American-born. These percentages show that not as many American- 
born children as would be indicated by the corresponding population 
are in reform schools. In the case of foreign-born children, they 
constitute 4.8 per cent of the population but 10.5 per cent of the total 
number of inmates in reformatory institutions. These institu- 
tions have an unusually high percentage of foreign-born children; 
in fact, more than twice as many as the foreign-born population 5 to 
19 years, inclusive, in this country would indicate. Comparing the 
bars representing the distribution of American children according to 
parentage, it is found that reformatory institutions have a very high 
percentage of children with foreign-born parents, a relatively low 
percentage of children with American-born parents, and about the 
proportion of children with one parent American as is shown for all in- 
mates combined. The ratios given in the second column of figures in 
the graph are secured by dividing the number of inmates by the 
population 5 to 19, inclusive, in corresponding groups. The average 
ratio between the total number of inmates and the total population is 
0.00102, found by dividing 28,426 by 27,824,207. The ratio for all 
“American” children is slightly lower than this average and for all 
“foreign” children, considerably higher than this. The American- 
born children are 6 per cent below this average, and the foreign-born 
122 per cent above this. An analysis of the American born shows 
that children with both parents American born are 16 per cent below 
this average; children with one American parent, 6 per cent below; 
and children with both parents foreign born, 41 per cent above. 
It can be seen, therefore, that the foreign element in our population 
makes unusually high contributions to our reformatory institutions. 
ILLITERACY. 
In Table 11 it will be noted that 10 per cent of the children com- 
mitted to industrial schools for delinquents can neither read nor 
write. Of the number discharged, 10 per cent can neither read nor 
write. It appears from. the statistics of the 109 schools and 116 
schools reporting these facts, respectively, that industrial schools for 
delinquents do not eliminate illiteracy. It should be noted that only 
those schools are considered which report both the total number com- + 
mitted and the total number of these who could neither read nor
-P-A-G-E-768
  768 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
write and the total number discharged and the number of these who 
could neither read nor write. These percentages, therefore, seem 
conclusive. It should be remarked however, that the expression 
“read and write” is subject to different interpretations by different 
schools. Presumably, many schools do not give actual tests to deter- 
mine the per cent of incoming illiterates. At any rate, the same test 
is not given by all schools reporting. The percentage of illiterates 
among drafted men for the Army as revealed by the Alpha and Beta 
tests was much higher than would be indicated by replies to the 
inquiry of the Bureau of the Census, ‘‘can you read and write?” 
It is possible, therefore, that more stringent tests are held for out- 
going than for in-coming inmates. If this is true, the percentages 
given above may be questionable. 
In addition to the per cent of persons committed to industrial 
schools for delinquents who could neither read nor write, another 8 
per cent could read the second reader but could not write. Alto- 
gether, 18 per cent of the children committed to reform schools can 
not write and 8 per cent can read only in the second reader. 
VALUATION OF PROPERTY PER INMATE. 
Altogether, 126 schools reported the value of property, but only 
122 gave both the valuation of property and the number of inmates 
in average enrollment, as given in Table 13. The valuation of prop- 
erty per child in ‘‘average enrollment” is shown in figure 16 for 
such States as had schools, either public or private, reporting both 
items. As the “‘average enrollment” represents the average number 
of inmates at the institutions and using the school property, it was 
used in preference to the total number of inmates enrolled during the 
year. Wyoming ranks highest with an average of $5,069, and 
Arizona second, with an average of $3,071. The only school in Utah 
reporting gave “‘0”’ as the valuation of property. The property used 
by the school is rented. Possibly some of the States are not fairly 
represented in this graph, since representative schools did not report 
the valuation of property. The average investment for the United 
States is $1,645 per child. Only 13 States have a higher average valua- 
tion than this and 30 States have a lower average. . This inequality 
of 13 and 30 States above and below the average, respectively, is due to 
the fact that a few States have an unusually high average investment. 
The most common investment is represented by the bars extending 
between $900 and $1,000, which are below the average. It should 
be remarked that the total valuation of property for these 122 schools 
is $50,660,801. The average valuation per school, therefore, is 
$415,252. If all schools of this type, numbering 159, had this 
average valuation of property, the total value of all property owned 
by industrial schools for delinquents would be $66,025,141. This 
aggregate, however, is only a very rough estimate and should be 
used with caution.

  770 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
RECEIPTS. 
As will be noted in Table 14, 130 schools reported receipts amount- 
ing to $13,031,130. Several of these schools reported only the total 
amount received and did not itemize the amounts received either as 
to ‘‘source” or ‘‘function.” The amount received from State, 
county, or city was $11,099,216, or 85 per cent of the total amount 
itemized ; from private benefactions, $315,473, or 2 per cent; andfrom 
all other sources, $1,616,441, or 13 per cent. In other words practi- 
cally all money received by these schools comes from public sources. 
The amount received for permanent equipment was $1,839,861, 
and for current expenses $10,460,166, in so far as the schools itemized 
their receipts as to function. In other words, 15 per cent of the 
receipts are to be used for making permanent improvements, and 
85 per cent for meeting current expenses. 
TOTAL EXPENDITURES. 
Out of 135 schools reporting this year, 132 gave a statement of 
their expenditures. -As will be noted in Table 14, the amount spent 
for buildings and lasting improvements in 1917-18 was $1,695,617; 
for teachers’ salaries, books, etc., $2,778,785; and forother salaries and 
all other expenses, $7,177,768, or a total of $12,401,067. It will be 
noted in Table 14 that the total amount spent was not always 
itemized by allschools. Consequently, the total given above exceeds 
the sum of the itemized amounts. The average expenditure of each 
institution was $93,947. If the three schools not reporting expendi- 
tures incurred the same average expense, the total expenditures for 
the 135 schools included in this report would be $12,682,908. If the 
24 industrial schools for delinquents, not reporting, should incur the 
same average expense, the total amount expended by all such schools 
would be $14, 937,636. This amount, however, is only a very rough 
eee PER CAPITA EXPENDITURES. 
By reference to Table 15 it will be found that 127 schools, public 
and private, reported both their total expenditures and their aver- 
age enrollment. The whole length of the horizontal bars in figure 
16 represents this total per capita cost. In all, 120 schools reported 
the cost of maintenance, as shown in Table 15. This per capita 
cost includes current expenses, but does not include outlays for 
new buildings or grounds. The black portion of the bars represents 
the cost of maintenance only. The open bars at the end of, the 
black ones represent, therefore, the per capita cost of new build- 
ings and grounds during the year. The States have been ranked on 
the magnitude of the bars representing current expenses or mainte- 
nance only, since ‘‘outlays”’ is subject to great periodical fluctuations 
and a State ranking very high in this score in 1918 might fall very low 
in 1920. Not so, however, with the cost of maintenance. 
Louisiana ranks first in the cost of maintenance, with an average 
per capita cost of $596, and Texas last with an average of $216, The

average for the United States is $287 for each child in average attend- 
ance at school. This average would be much lower if the total num- 
ber on the roll during the year had been used in computing it. Since 
each child in reformatory institutions, as will be shown below, is on 
the roll only 58 per cent of a year, the actual per capita cost for each 
inmate enrolled would be 58 per cent of $287 or $166. This latter 
number should be used with consideration. It means that each 
child committed to a reform school costs the State $166, while the 
former number means that the cost of keeping an inmate in a reform 
school for one year is $287. 
The highest per capita expenditure made by any State for new 
buildings or grounds was in Wyoming, the average being $894. The 
State ranking second on this score was Nevada, with an average of 
$563. As would be expected, several States made no expenditures 
for outlays. The highest per capita total expenditures made by any 
State was in Wyoming, where the average was $1,150, and the low- 
est in New Hampshire, where the average was only $103, If any 
States have not been fairly considered in this figure, it is because the 
reform schools within their boundaries did not give the facts necessary 
for the computation of these averages or did not report at all. For 
most States, however, the list will be representative. It is evident 
from the graph that a large number of States are making small per 
capita expenditures for their reform schools. No attempt has been 
made, however, to determine the relative efficiency of the schools in 
the different States, but undoubtedly a greater ‘‘reformation”’ can 
be effected with $500 than with $100. 
ENDOWMENT FUNDS. 
In Table 7 the names of the industrial schools for delinquents 
having endowment funds are given. It is found that 16 schools 
have such funds, and only 3 of these received any endowment during 
the year. The aggregate endowment reported is $780,378. The 
additional amount received in 1917-18 was $10,750.

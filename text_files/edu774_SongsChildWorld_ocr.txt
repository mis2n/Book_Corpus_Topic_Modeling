Preface. (2) 
In this hook of songs for little children thes is an effort to lead kindergartners in- 
to a use of such songs as reflect the ideals of universal truths which the kindergar- 
ten aims to present to the child by means of stories, songs, pictures and games. 
Froehel’s “Mother Play Book” has furnished the standard of thought and we have 
tried to discriminate carefully in the song - pictures here given in order that the child 
may sing of ideal experiences and may grow into a love of harmonious living at the 
same time that he grows in love of harmonious sounds. ‘ 
Carlyle tells us that “All deep things are song, x x x Poetry is musical thought. 
x x x See deep enough and you see musically; the heart of nature being every where 
music, if you can only reach it.” 
With the three-fold force of Music,Poetry and Thought, we have worked togeth- 
er, hoping to add to the power for good which lies in song; to the culture and ad - 
vancement of little children towards musical seeing and finally to lead them into 
harmonious being, until the music of the spheres shall be within them and thus 
“Make life death and that vast forever, 
One grand, sweet song.” 
‘ : HELEN A. LLOYD. 
— 
Preface. (b) 
The gratifying recognition accorded by the public to a previous -issue of songs for 
little folks has led the composer to undertake the writing of the songs in this little 
book for use in Kindergarten and Primary work. 
Realizing the necessity of harmony between the thought of the song and the anu- 
sic, we have worked together in their production in order that the text and the mu- 
sic might add each to the other. : 
Understanding as we do the innate fondness of children for rich harmonies we have 
given special attention to the harmonization of the melodies, and although it is occa- 
sionally necessary for children to sing without accompaniment yet euch a lack is to be 
deplored, as the accompaniment often serves as the rhythmic expression of- the thought. 
Children perceive rhythm before they do melody: and the cultivation of this perception is 
essential to any musical education. It has been our earnest endeavor to make the rhythm 
of music and words so fit the idea to he expressed that the child shall be trained to the re- 
cognition and conciousness of the rhythm that sways all nature. 
In the trade songs we have found it necessary to deal withthe primitive forms of theva- 
rious trades since to think of the modern methods of production is to Jeave,all poetry far 
behind. As will be seen,the Naturesongs occupy a large portion of the book. It is gratify- 
ing to us to realize the almost infinite scope of music and verse in this.directiun, for in 
the’study, appreciation’ and love of nature the child’s heart is opened and made respun- 
sive to the higher things of life. 11428 JESSIE. L. GAYNOR

HIS STORY OF POCAHONTAS* — va 
Here more than two hundred of tilowe grim 
Courtiers stood wondering at him [John Smith], 
as he had beene a monster; till Powhatan’ 
and his train had put themselves in their 
greatest braveries. Before a fire upon a 
seat like a bedsted, he sat covered with a great 
robe, made of Raroweun skinnes, and all the 
tayles hanging by. On either hand did sit a 
young wench of 16 or 18 years, and along on 
each side the house, two rowes of men, and be- 
hind them as many women, with all their heads 
1From Smith’s “General! Historie of Virginia.” 
2 Powhatan was chief of a confederacy of Indians known 
as the Powhatans, which he had raised from one com- 
prizing only seven tribes to one of thirty. The word Pow- 
hatan means “falls in a stream,” and was originally applied 
to the falls in the James river at Richmond,

  and shoulders painted red; many of their heads 
bedecked with the white downe of Birds; but 
every one with something: and a great chain of 
white beads about their necks. 
At his entrance before the King, all the people 
gave a great shout. The Queene of Appamatuck 
wae apps ed to bring him water to wash his 
Shands, and. ‘another brought him a bunch of feath- 
ers, instead of a towel to dry them. Having 
feasted him ‘after’ their best barbarous manner 
they could. 8 ‘long consultation was held, but the 
conclusion. was, two, great stones were brought 
before Powhatan: then as many as could laid 
hands on him, dragged him to them, and thereon 
laid his head, and being ready with their clubs, 
to beate out his braines, Pocahontas the King’s 
dearest daughter, when no intreaty could prevaile, 
got his head in her armes, and laid her owne 
upon his to save him from death: whereat the 
Emperour was contented he should live to make 
him hatchets, and her bells, beads, and copper; 
for they thought bim as well of all occupations 
as themselves. For the King himselfe will make 
his owne robes, shooes, bowes, arrowes, pots; 
plant, hunt, or doe any thing so well as the 
rest. . . 
To conclude our peace, thus it happened. Cap- 
taine Argall* having entered into a great ac- 
quaintance with Japazaws, an old friend of Cap- 
taine Smith’s, and so to all our Nation, ever 
since hee discovered the Countrie: hard by him 
% Argall, through intimidation or bribery, had made Poca- 
hontas a captive in 1612, when she was the wife of an 
Indian attached to her father as a subordinate chief or 
leader.

JOHN SMITH 
  there was Poeahontas, whom Captaine Smith’s 
Relations intituleth the Numparell of Virginia, 
and tho she had beene many times a preserver 
of him and the whole Colenie, yet till this ac 
cident shee was never seene at James towne since 
his departure, being at Patawomeke, as it seemes, 
thinking her selfe unkncwn, was easily by her 
friend Japazaws perswaded to goe abroad with 
him and his wife to see the ship, for Captaine 
Argall had promised him a Copper Kettle to 
bring her but to him, promising no way to hurt 
her, but keepe her till they could conclude a 
peace with her father. The Salvage for this 
Copper Kettle would have done any thing, it 
seemed by the Relation; for tho she had seene 
and beene in many ships, yet he caused his wife 
to faine how desirous she was to see one, and 
that he offered to beat her for her importunitie, 
till she wept. 
But at last he told her, if Pocahontas would goe 
with her, he was content: and thus they betrayed 
the poore innocent Pocahontas aboord, where they 
were all kindly feasted in the cabin. Japazaws 
treading oft on the Captaine’s foot, to remember 
he had done his part, the Captaine when he saw 
his time, perswaded Pocahontas to the gun-roome, 
faining to have some conference with Japazaws, 
which was only that she should not perceive he 
was any way guiltie of her captivitie: so sending 
for her againe, he told her before her friends, 
she must goe with him, and compound peace be- 
twixt her Countrie and us, before she ever should 
see Powhatan, whereat the old Jew and his wife 
began to howle and crie as fast as Pocahontas, 
that upon the Captaine’s fair perswasions, by

  degrees pacifying her selfe, and Japazaws and 
his wife, with the Kettle and other toys, went 
merrily on shore, and she to James towne. A 
messenger forthwith was sent to her father, that 
his daughter Pocahontas he loved so dearly, he 
must ransome with. our men, swords, pieces, 
tooles, ete., he trecherously had stolne. . . 
Long before this, Master John Rolfe, an honest 
Gentleman, and of good behaviour, had beene in 
love with Pocahontas, and she with him, which 
thing at that instant I made knowne to Sir 
Thomas Dale by a letter from him, wherein hee 
intreated his advice, and she aequainted her 
brother with it, which resolution Sir Thomas Dale‘ 
well approved. The bruit of this mariage came 
soone to. the knowledge of Powhatan, a thing 
acceptable to him, as appeared by his sudden 
eonsent, for within ten days he sent Opachiseo, 
an old Unele of hers, and two of his sons, to see 
the manner of the mariage, and to doe in that 
behalfe what they requested, for the confirmation 
thereof, as his deputie; which was accordingly 
done about the first of Aprill, And ever since 
we have had friendly trade and commerce, as 
well with Powhatan himself, as all his sub- 
jects. . . 
The Lady Rebecea,® alias Pocahontas, daughter 
to Powhattan, by the diligent care of Master John 
Rolfe her husband and his friends, as taught to 
‘Dale was colonial governor of Virginia in 1611 and 
again in 1614-16. In the latter year he returned to Eng- land, taking with him Captain Rolfe and Pocahontas. 5 Under that name Pocahontas had been baptized in the 
original Jamestown church. A legend has survived that 
an old font, now preserved in the church at Williamsburg, 
is the one from which she was baptized.

  speake such English as might well bee understood, 
well instructed in Christianitie, and was become 
very formal and civil after our English manner; 
she had also by him a childe which she loved most 
dearely and the Treasurer and Company tooke 
order both for the maintenance of her and it, 
besides there were divers persons of great ranke 
and qualitie had beene very kinde to her; and 
before she arrived at London, Captaine Smith 
to deserve her former courtesies, made her quali- 
ties knowne to the Queene’s most excellent Maj- 
estie and her Court, and writ a little booke to 
this effect to the Queene: An abstract whereof 
followeth. 
“*To the most high and vertuous Princesse 
Queene Anne of Great Brittante. 
‘*Most ADMIRED QUEENE, 
“The love I beare my God, my King, and 
Countrie hath so oft emboldened me in the worst 
of extreme dangers, that now honestie doth con- 
straine mee presume thus far beyond my selfe, 
to present your Majestie this short discourse: 
If ingratitude be a deadly poyson to all honest 
vertues, I must bee guiltie of that crime if IT 
should omit any meanes to bee thankful. So it 
is, that some ten yeers agoe being in Virginia, 
and taken prisoner by the power of Powhatan 
their chiefe King, I received from this great 
Salvage exceeding great courtesie, especially from 
his son Nantaquaus, the most manliest, comeliest, 
boldest spirit, I ever saw in a Salvage, and his 
sister Poeahontas, the King’s most deare and 
well-beloved daughter, being but a childe of 
twelve or thirteene yeers of age, whose compas- 
sionate pitiful heart, of desperate estate, gave

  me much cause to respect her: I being the first 
Christian this proud King and his grim attend- 
ants ever saw: and thus inthralled in their bar- 
barous power, I cannot say I felt the least occa- 
sion of want that was in the power of those my 
mortal foes to prevent, notwithstanding all their 
threats. After some six weeks fatting among 
those Salvage Courtiers, at the. minute of my 
execution, she hazarded the beating out of her 
owne braines to save mine, and not only that, but 
so prevaild with her father, that I was safely 
condueted to James towne, where I found about 
eight and thirtie miserable poore and sicke crea- 
tures, to keepe possession of ail those large ter- 
ritories of Virginia. Such was the weakuesse 
of this poore Commonwealth, as had the Salvages 
not fed us, we directly had starved. 
‘‘And this reliefe, most gracious Queene, was 
commonly brought us by this Lady Poeahontas, 
notwithstanding all these passages when ineon- 
stant Fortune turned our peace to war, this tender 
Virgin would still not spare to dare to visit us, and 
by her our jars have beene oft appeased, and 
our wants still supplyed; were it the policie of 
her father thus to imploy her, or the ordinance 
of God thus to make her His instrument, or her 
extraordinary affection to our Nation, I know 
-not: but of this I am sure:—when her father 
with the utmost of his policie and power, sought 
to surprize mee, having but eighteene with mee, 
the darke night could not affright her from com- 
ming through the irkesome woods, and with 
watered eyes gave me intelligence, with her best 
advice to eseape his furie; which had hee knowne, 
hee had surely slaine her. James towne with her

wild traine she as freely frequented, as her fath- 
er’s habitation; and during the time of two or 
three yeeres, she next under God, was still the 
instrument to preserve this Colonie from death, 
famine and utter confusion, which if in those 
times had once beene dissolved, Virginia might 
have line as it was at our first arrival to this 
day. Since then, this businesse having beene 
turned and varied by many accidents from that 
I left it at: it is most ecertaine, after a long and 
troublesome war after my departure, betwixt her 
father and our Colonie, all which time shee was 
not heard of, about two yeeres after she her selfe 
was taken prisoner, being so detained neere two 
yeeres longer, the Colonie by that meanes was 
relieved, peace concluded, and at last rejecting 
her barbarous condition, was maried to an Eng- 
lish Gentleman, with whom at this present she 
is in England; the first Christian ever of that 
Nation, the first Virginian ever spake English, 
or had a childe in mariage by an Englishman, 
a matter surely, if my meaning bee truly con- 
sidered and well understood, worthy a Prince’s 
understanding. . 
The small time I staid i in London, divers Cour- 
tiers and others, my acquaintances, hath gone 
with mee to see her, that generally concluded, 
they did thinke God had a great hand in her con- 
version, and they have seen many English Ladies 
worse favored, proportioned and behaviored, and 
as since I have heard, it pleased both the King 
and Queene’s Majestie honorably to esteeme her, 
accompanied with that honorable Lady the Lady 
De la Warre, and that honorable Lord her hus- 
band, and divers other persons of good qualities,

both publikely at the maskes and otherwise, to 
her great satisfaction and content, which doubt- 
lesse she would have deserved had she lived to 
arrive in Virginia.® 
® Pocahontas in England gave birth to a son, She diced 
at Gravesend in the following year, in 1617, The parish 
records of Gravesend describe her as “‘a Virginia lady borne, 
here was buried in ye chauncell.” In London a well-known 
street preserves a memorial of her in its name—La Belle 
Sauvage. Her son, Thomas Rolfe, after living many years 
in England, settled in Virginia. Several families in that 
State have traced their descent from him. One of these 
was the famous John Randolph of Roanoke.

WILLIAM BRADFORD 
Born in England in 1590, died at Plymouth, Mass. in 
1657; governor of Plymouth Colony from 1627, except for 
five years, to 1657; wrote a “History of the Plymouth 
Plantation” for the period 1602-47, the manuscript of which 
was lost in England, but after the lapse of about seventy- 
five years it was found in a library in 1855, and in the 
following year published. 
THE PILGRIMS LAND AND MEET THE 
INDIANS?* 
(1620) 
Havine the wind good, we sailed all that day. 
along the coast about fifteen leagues; but saw 
neither river nor creek to put into. After we 
had sailed an hour or two, it began to snow and 
rain, and to be bad weather. About the midst of 
the afternoon the wind increased, and the seas 
began to be very rough; and the hinges of the 
rudder broke, so that we could steer no longer 
with it, but two men, with much ado, were fain 
to serve with a couple of oars. The seas were 
grown so great that we were much troubled and 
in great danger; and night grew on. Anon, Mas- 
ter Coppin bade us be of good cheer; he saw 
the harbor. As we drew near, the gale being

generally, called the “Journal,” or diary, of Bradford and 
Edward Winslow. This important historical document covers 
the first year of the Plymouth colony.

  stiff, and we bearing great sail to get in, split 
our mast in three pieces, and were like to have 
east away our shallop. Yet, by God’s mercy, 
recovering ourselves, we had the fiood with us, 
and struck into the harbor. 
Now he that thought that had been the place, 
was deceived, it being a place where not any of 
us had been before; and coming into the harbor, 
he that was our pilot, did bear up northward, 
which if he had continued, we had been cast away. 
Yet still the Lord kept us and we bare up 
for an island before us, and recovering of 
that island, being compassed about with many 
rocks, and dark night growing upon us, it pleased 
the Divine Providence that we fell upon a place 
of sandy ground, where our shallop did ride safe 
and secure all that night; and coming upon a 
strange island, kept our watch all night in the 
rain upon that island. And in the morning we 
marehed about it, and found no inhabitants at 
all; and here we made our rendezvous all that 
day, being Saturday, 10th of December. On the 
Sabbath day we rested; and on Monday we 
sounded the harbor, and found it a very good 
harbor for our shipping. We marched also into 
the land, and found divers cornfields, and little 
running brooks, a place very good for situation. 
So we returned to our ship again with good news 
to the rest of our people, which did much comfort 
their hearts. a 
Some of us, having a good mind, for safety, 
to plant in the greater isle, we crossed the bay, 
which is there five or six miles over, and found 
the isle about a mile and half or two miles about, 
all wooded, and no fresh water but two or three 
12
-P-A-G-E-26
  WILLIAM BRADFORD 
  pits, that we doubted of fresh water in summer, 
and so full of wood as we could hardly clear so 
much as to serve us for corn. Besides, we judged 
it cold for our corn, and some part very rocky; 
yet divers thought of it as a place defensible, and 
of great security. That night we returned again 
a shipboard, with resolution the next morning to 
settle on some of those places. 
So in the morning, after we had called on God 
for direction, we came to this resolution, to go 
presently ashore again, and to take a better view 
of two places which we thought most fitting for 
us; for we could not now take time for further 
search or consideration, our victuals being much 
spent, especially our beer, and it being now the 
19th of December. After our landing and view- 
ing of the places, so well as we could, we came 
to a conclusion, by most voices, to set on the 
main land, on the first place, on a high ground, 
where there is a great deal of land cleared, and 
hath been planted with corn three or four years 
ago; and there is a very sweet brook runs under 
the hill side, and many delicate springs of as 
good water as can be drunk, and where we may 
harbor our shallops and boats exceeding weil; 
and in this brook much good fish in their seasons; 
on the further side of the river also much ecorn- 
ground cleared. In one field is a great hill, on 
which we point to make a platform, and plant 
our ordnance, which will command all round 
about. From thence we may see into the bay, 
and far into the sea; and we may see thence 
Cape Cod. Our greatest labor will be fetching 
of our wood, which is half a quarter of an English 
mile; but there is enough so far off. What people 
13
-P-A-G-E-27

  inhabit here we yet know not, for as yet we 
have seen none. So there we made our rendez- 
vous, and a place for some of our people, about 
twenty, resolving in the morning to come all 
ashore and to build houses. 
But the next morning, being Thursday, the 21st 
of December, it was stormy and wet, that we 
could not gc ashore; and those that remained 
there all night could do nothing, but were wet, 
not having daylight enough to make them a 
sufficient court of guard, to keep them dry. All 
that night it blew and rained extremely. It was 
so tempestuous that the shallop could not go on 
land so’soon as was meet, for they had no vic- 
tuals on land. About eleven o’clock the shallop 
went off with much ado with provision, but could 
not return, it blew so strong; and was such foul 
weather that we were forced to let fall our 
anchor, and ride with three anchors ahead. 
Friday, the 22d, the storm still continued, that 
we could not get a land, nor they come to us 
aboard. . . . . 
Saturday, the 23d, so many of us as could 
went on shore, felled and carried timber, to-pro- 
vide themselves stuff for building. 
Sunday, the 24th, our people on shore heard 
a ery of some savages, as they thought, which 
caused an alarm and to stand on their guard, 
expecting an assault; but all was quiet. 
Friday, the 16th, a fair warm day toward. 
This morning we determined to conclude of the 
military orders, which we had begun to consider 
of before, but were interrupted by the savages, 
as we mentioned formerly. And while we were 
busied, hereabout, we were interrupted again;

  for there presented himself a savage, which 
caused an alarm. He very boldly came all alone, 
and along the houses, straight to the rendezvous; 
where we intercepted him, not suffering him to 
go in, as undoubtedly he would out of his bold- 
ness. He saluted us in English, and bade us 
‘‘Welcome!’’ for he had learned some broken 
English among the Englishmen that eame to fish 
at Monhiggon, and knew by name the most of 
the captains, commanders and masters, that usu- 
ally come. He was a man free in speech, so far 
as he could express his mind, and of a seemly 
earriage. We questioned him of many things; 
he was the first savage we could meet withal. 
He said he was not of these parts, but of Morat- 
tiggon, and one of the sagameres or lords there- 
of; and had been eight months in these parts, 
it lying hence a day’s sail with a great wind, and 
five days by land. He discoursed of the whole 
eountry, and of every province, and of their 
sagamores, and their number of men and strength. 
The wind beginning to rise a little, we cast a 
horseman’s coat about him; for he was stark 
naked, only a leather about his waist, with a 
fringe about a span long or little more. He had 
a bow and two arrows, the one headed, and the 
other unheaded. He was a tall, straight man, 
the hair of his head black, long behind, only 
short before, none on his face at all. He asked 
some beer, but we gave him strong water, and 
biseuit, and butter, and cheese, and pudding, and 
a piece of mallard; all which he liked well, and 
had been acquainted with such amongst the Eng- 
lish. He told us the place where we now live 
is called Patuxet, and that about four years ago

  all the inhabitants died of an extraordinary 
plague, and there is neither man, woman, nor 
child remaining, as indeed we have found none; 
so as there is none to hinder our possession, or 
to lay claim unto it. All the afternoon we spent 
in communication with him. We would gladly 
have been rid of him at night, but he was not 
willing to go this night. Then we thought to 
earry him on shipboard, wherewith he was well 
content, and went into the shallop; but the wind 
was high and the water scant, that it could not 
return back. We lodged him that night at Steven 
Hopkin’s house, and watched him. 
The next day he went away back to the Masa- 
soits, from whence he said he came, who are 
our next bordering neighbors. They are sixty 
strong, as he saith. The Nausites are as near, 
southeast of them, and are a hundred strong; 
and those were they of whom our people were 
encountered, as we before related. They are 
much incensed and provoked against the English ; 
and about eight months ago slew three English- 
men, and two more hardly escaped by flight to 
Monhiggon. They were Sir Ferdinando Gorge’s? 
men, as this savage told us; as he did likewise of 
the huggery, that is, fight, that our discoverers 
had with the Nausites, and of our tools that were 
taken out of the woods, which we willed him, 
shonld be brought again; otherwise we would

called “the father. of English colonization in America.”

right ourselves. These people are ill affected to- 
ward the English by reason of one Hunt, a master 
of a ship, who deceived the people and got them, 
under color of trucking with them, twenty out 
of this very place where we inhabit, and seven 
men from the Nausites, and carried them away, 
and sold them for slaves, like a wretched man 
(for twenty pound a man) that cares not what 
mischief he doth for his profit. 
Saturday, in the morning, we dismissed the 
savage, and gave him a knife, a bracelet, and 
a ring. He promised within a night or two to 
come again and to bring with him some of the 
Masasoits, our neighbors, with such beavers’ 
skins as they had to truck with us. 
Saturday and Sunday reasonable fair days. 
On this day came again the savage, and brought 
with him five other tall, proper men. They had 
every man a deer’s skin on him, and the principal 
of them had a wild cat’s skin, or such like, on 
the one arm. They had most of them long hosen 
up to their groins, close made, and above their 
groins to their waist another leather; they were 
altogether like the Irish trousers. They are of 
complexion like our English gipseys; no hair or 
very little on their faces; on their heads long 
hair to their shoulders, only cut before; some 
trussed up before with a feather, broad-wise, 
like a fan; another a fox-tail, hanging out. These 
left (aceording to our charge given him before) 
their bows and arrows a quarter of a mile from 
our town. We gave them entertainment as we 
thought was fitting them. They did eat liberally 
of our English vietuals. They made semblance 
unto us of friendship and amity. They sang and

  danced after their manner, like antics. They 
brought with them in a thing like a bow-case 
(which the principal of them had about his waist) 
a little of their corn pounded to powder, which, 
put to a little water, they eat. He had a little 
tobacco in a bag; but none of them drank but 
when he liked. Some of them had their faces 
painted black, from the forehead to the chin, four 
or five fingers broad; others after other fashions, 
as they liked. They brought three or four skins; 
but we would not truck with them at all that 
day, but wished them to bring more, and we 
would truek for all; which they promised within 
a night or two, and would leave these behind 
them, tho we were not willing they should; and 
they brought us all our tools again, which were 
taken in the woods, in our men’s absence. So, 
because of the day, we dismissed them so soon 
as we could. But Samoset,’ our first acquaint- 
ance, either was sick or feigned himself so, and 
would not go with them, and stayed with us till 
Wednesday morning. Then we sent him to them 
to know the reason they came not according to 
their words; and we gave him a hat, a pair of 
stockings and shoes, a shirt, and a piece of cloth 
to tie about bis waist.

firm in his friendship with the Plymouth colonists,

HOW HE COURTED MADAM 
WINTHROP* 
(1720) 
Sepremser 5, 1720. Mary Hirst goes to Board 
with Madam Oliver and her Mother Loyd. Going 
to Son Sewall’s I there meet with Madam Win- 
throp, told her I was glad to meet her there, had 
not seen her a great while; gave her Mr. Homes’s 
Sermon. . . . 
2¥rom Sewall’s “Diary,” as published by the Massachu- 
setts Historical Society in 1882, 
Mrs. Winthrop was the widow of General Waite Still 
‘Winthrop, a son of John Winthrop, Governor of Connecticut, 
who was a son of John Winthrop, Governor of the Massa- 
chusetts Bay Colony. Her maiden name was Katharine 
Brattle. She had first married John Eyre, with whom she 
lived about twenty years, and by whom she had twelve 
children. She was born in 1664, and ‘at the time of Sewall’s 
courtship of her was fifty-six and he sixty-nine. General 
‘Winthrop and Mrs. Sewall had died a few years before 
within & month of each other. Madam Winthrop did not 
marry Judge Sewall, nor any one else. She died five 
years after the date of this courtship.

September 30. Mr. Colman’s Leeture: Daugh- 
ter Sewall acquaints Madam Winthrop that if 
she pleas’d to be within at 3 p.m. I would wait 
on her. She answer’d she would be at home. 
Oetober 1. Satterday, I dine at Mr. Stod- 
dard’s: from thence I went to Madam Winthrop’s 
just at 3. Spake to her, saying, my loving wife 
died so soon and suddenly, ‘twas hardly conve- 
nient for me to think of marrying again; however 
T came to this Resolution, that I would not make 
my Court to any person without first Consulting 
with her. Had a pleasant discourse about 7 
[seven] Single persons sitting in the Fore-seat. 
She propounded one and another for me; but 
none would do, said Mrs. Loyd was about her 
Age. 
October 3. 2. Waited on Madam Winthrop 
again; ’twas a little while before she came in. 
Her daughter Noyes being there alone with me, 
I said, I hoped my Waiting on her Mother would 
not be disagreeable to her. She answer’d she 
should not be against that that might be for 
her Comfort. I Saluted her, and told her I 
perceived I must shortly wish her a good Time; 
(her mother had told me, she was with Child, 
and within a Moneth or two of her Time). By 
and by in came Mr. Airs, Chaplain of the Castle, 
and hang’d up his Hat, which I was a little 
startled at, it seeming as if he was to lodge there. 
At last Madam Winthrop came too. After a con- 
siderable time, I went up to her and said, if it 
might not be inconvenient I desired to speak with 
her. She assented, and spake of going into an- 
other Room; but Mr. Airs and Mrs. Noyes pres- 
ently rose up, and went out, leaving us there alone.

  Then I usher’d in Discourse from the names in the 
Fore-seat; at last I pray’d that Katharine [Mrs. 
Winthrop] might be the person assign’d for me. 
She instantly took it up in the way of Denyal, “ 
as if she had catch’d at an Opportunity to do 
it, saying she could not do it before she was 
asked. Said that was her mind unless she should © 
Change it, which she believed she should not; 
could not leave her Children. I express’d my 
Sorrow that she should do it so Speedily, pray’d 
her Consideration, and ask’d her when I should 
wait on her agen. She setting no time, I men- 
tioned that day Sennight. Gave her Mr. Wil- 
lard’s Fountain open’d with the little print and 
verses; saying, I hop’d if we did well read that 
book, we should meet together hereafter, if we 
did not now. She took the Book, and put it in 
her Pocket. Took Leave. 
Oetober 5. Midweek, I din’ed with the Court; 
from thence went and visited Cousin Jonathan’s 
wife, Lying in with her little Betty. Gave the 
Nurse 2s. Altho I had appointed to wait upon 
her, Madam Winthrop, next Monday, yet-I went 
from my Cousin Sewall’s thither about 3 p.m. 
The Nurse told me Madam dined abroad at her 
daughter Noyes’s, they were to go out together. 
T ask’d for the Maid, who was not within. Gave 
Katee a penny and a Kiss, and came away. Ac- 
eompanyed my Son and daughter Cooper in their 
Remove to their New House. 
October 6. A little after 6 p.m. I went to 
Madam Winthrop’s. She was not within, I 
gave Sarah Chickering the Maid 2s., Juno, who 
brought in wood, 1s. Afterward the Nurse came 
in, I gave her 18d., having no other. small Bill.

  After awhile Dr. Noyes came in with his Mother ; 
and quickly after his wife came in: They sat 
talking, I think, till eight a-clock. I said I fear’d 
I might be some Interruption to their Business : 
Dr. Noyes reply’d pleasantly: He fear’d they 
might be an Interruption to me, and went away. 
Madam seem’d to harp upon the same string. 
Must take care of her Children; could not leave that 
House and Neighborhood where she had dwelt so 
Jong. I told her she might doe her children as 
much or more good by bestowing what she laid 
out in Hous-keeping, upon them. Said her Son 
would be of age the 7th of August. I said it 
might be inconvenient for her to dwell with her 
Daughter-in-Law, who must be Mistress of the 
House. I gave her a piece of Mr. Belcher’s Cake 
and Ginger-Bread wrapped up in a clean sheet 
of Paper; told her of her Father’s kindness to 
me when Treasurer, and I Constable. My Daugh- 
ter Judith was gon from me and I was more 
lonesom—might help to forward one another in 
our Journey to Canaan.—Mr. Hyre* came within 
the door; I saluted him, ask’d how Mr. Clark 
did, and he went away. I took leave about 9 
aclock. I told [her] I came now.to refresh her 
Memory as to Monday night; said she had not 
forgot it. In discourse with her, I ask’d leave 
to speak with her Sister; I meant to gain Madam 
Mico’s favour to persuade her Sister. She seem’d 
surpris’d and displeas’d, and said she was in the 
same condition! . . - 
October 10. In the Evening I visited Madam 
Winthrop, who treated me with a great deal of 
2A gon of Madam Winthrop by her first marriage.

SAMUEL SEWALL an 
Curtesy; Wine, Marmalade. I gave her a News- 
Letter about the Thanksgiving; Proposals, for 
sake of the Verses for David Jeffries. She tells 
me Dr. Increase Mather visited her this day, in 
Mr. Hutchinson’s Coach. 
October 11. I writ a few Lines to Madam 
Winthrop to this purpose: ‘‘Madam, These wait 
on you with Mr. Mayhew’s Sermon, and Account 
of the state of the Indians on Martha’s Vinyard. 
I thank you for your Unmerited Favors of yes- 
terday; and hope to have the Happiness of Wait- 
ing on you to-morrow before Hight a-clock after 
Noon. I pray Gop to keep you, and give you a 
joyfull entrance upon the Two Hundred and 
twenty-ninth year of Christopher Columbus his 
Discovery; and take Leave, who am, Madam, your 
humble Servant. 8. 8.77 
Sent this by Deacon Green, who deliver’d it 
to Sarah Chickering, her Mistress not being at 
home. 
October 12. At Madam Winthrop’s Steps I 
took leave of Capt Hill, &. Mrs. Anne Cotton 
eame to door (twas before 8.) said Madam Win- 
throp was within, directed me into the little 
Room, where she was full of work behind a 
Stand Mrs. Cotton came in and stood. Madam 
Winthrop pointed to her to set me a Chair. 
Madam Winthrop’s. Countenance was much 
changed from what ’twas on Monday, look’d 
dark and lowering. At last, the work, (black 
stuff or Silk) was taken away, I got my Chair 
in place, had some Converse, but very Cold and 
indifferent to what "twas before. Ask’d her 
to acquit me of Rudeness if I drew off her Glove. 
Enquiring the reason, I told her twas great odds

  between handling a dead Goat, and a living Lady. 
Got it off. I told her I had one Petition to ask 
of her, that was, that she would take off the 
Negative she laid on me the third of October; 
She readily answer’d she could not, and enlarg’ad 
upon it; She told me of it so soon as she could ; 
could not leave her house, children, neighbours, 
business. I told her she might do som Good to 
help and support me. Mentioning Mrs. Gookin, 
Nath, the widow Weld was spoken of; said I 
had visited Mrs. Denison. I told her Yes! After- 
ward I said, If after a first and second Vagary 
she would Accept of me returning, Her Victorious 
Kindness and Good Will would be very Obliging. 
She thank’d me for my Book, (Mr. Mayhew’s 
Sermon), But said not a word of the Letter. 
When she insisted on the Negative, I pray’d there 
might be no more Thunder and Lightening, I 
should not sleep all night. I gave her Dr. Pres- 
ton, The Church’s Marriage and the Chureh’s 
Carriage, which cost me 6s. at the Sale. The 
door standing open, Mr. Airs came in, hung up 
His hat, and sat down. After awhile, Madam 
Winthrop moving, he went out. Jno. Eyre look’d 
in, I said How do ye, or your servant Mr. Eyre: 
but heard no word from him. Sarah fill’d a 
Glass of Wine, she drank to me, I to her, She 
sent Juno home with me with a good Lantern, 
I gave her 6d. and bid her thank her Mistress, 
In some of our Discourse, I told her I had rather 
go the Stone-House adjoining to her, than to come 
to her against her mind. Told her the reason why 
I came every other night was lest I should drink 
too deep draughts of Pleasure. She had talk’d 
of Canary, her Kisses were to me better than the

ing Columbus,

that the Weather was not so fair as I apprehended. 
October 17. In the Evening I visited Madam 
Winthrop, who Treated me Courteously, but not 
in Clean Linen as somtimes. She said, she did 
not know whether I would come again, or no. 
T ask’d her how she could so impute inconstancy 
to me. (I had not visited her since Wednesday 
night being unable to get over the Indisposition 
received by the Treatment received that night, 
and I must in it seem’d to sound like a made 
piece of Formality.) Gave her this day’s Gazett. 
Heard David Jeffries say the Lord’s Prayer, and 
some other portions of the Seriptures. He came 
to the door, and ask’d me to go into Chamber, 
where his Grandmother was tending Little Katee, 
to whom she had given Physick; but I chose 
to sit below. Dr. Noyes and his wife came in, 
and sat a considerable time; had been visiting 
Son and daughter Cooper. Juno came home with 
me. 
October 18. Visited Madam Mico, who came 
to me in a splendid Dress. I said, It may be 
you have heard of my Visiting Madam Winthrop, 
her Sister. She answered, Her Sister had told 
her of it. I ask’d her good Will in the Affair. 
She answer’d, If her Sister were for it, she 
should not hinder it. I gave ber Mr. Homes’s 
Sermon. She gave me a Glass of Canary, enter- 
tain’d me with good Discourse, and a Respectfull 
Remembrance of my first Wife. I took Leave.

throp; Sarah told me she was at Mr. Walley’s,

  would not come home till late. I gave her Han- 
nah 3 oranges with her Duty, not knowing wheth- 
er I should find her or no. Was ready to go 
home: but said if I knew she was there, I would 
go thither. Sarah seem’d to speak with pretty 
good Courage, She would be there. I went and 
found her there, with Mr. Walley and his wife 
in the little Room below. At 7 a-clock I men- 
tioned going home; at 8. I put on my Coat, and 
quickly waited on her home. She found oceasion 
to speak loud to the servant, as if she had a 
mind to be known. Was Courteous to me; but 
took occasion to speak pretty earnestly about 
my keeping a Coach: I said ’twould cost £100. 
per annum: she said twould cost but £40. Spake 
much against John Winthrop, his false-hearted- 
ness. Mr, Eyre came in and sat awhile; I offer’d 
him Dr. Iner. Mather’s Sermons, whereof Mr. 
Appleton’s Ordination Sermon was one; said he 
had them already. I said I would give him an- 
other. Exit. Came away somewhat late. 
October 20. Promis’d to wait on the Governor 
about 7. Madam Winthrop not being at Lecture, 
I went thither first; found her very Serene with 
her daughter Noyes, Mrs. Dering, and the widow 
Shipreev sitting at a little Table, she in her 
arm’d Chair. She drank to me, and I to Mrs. 
Noyes. After awhile pray’d the favor to speak 
with her. She took one of the Candles, and went 
into the best Room, clos’d the shutters, sat down 
upon the Couch. She told me Madam Usher had 
been there, and said the Coach must be set on 
Wheels, and not by Rusting. She spake some- 
thing of my needing a Wigg. Ask’d me what 
her Sister said to me. I told her, She said, If

SAMUEL SEWALL 
  her Sister were for it, She would not hinder it. 
But I told her, she did not say she would be 
glad to have me for her Brother. Said, I shall 
keep you in the Cold, and asked her if she would 
be within to morrow night, for we had had but 
a running Feat. She said she could not tell 
whether she should, or no. I took Leave. As 
were drinking at the Governour’s, he said: In 
England the Ladies minded little more than that 
they might have Money, and Coaches to ride in. 
I said, And New-England brooks its Name. At 
which Mr. Dudley smiled. Governour said they 
were not quite so bad here. 
October 21. Friday, My Son, the Minister, 
eame to me P.M. by appointment and we pray 
one for another in the Old Chamber; more espe- 
cially respecting my Courtship. ‘About 6, a-clock 
I go to Madam Winthrop’s; Sarah told me her 
Mistress was gon out, but did not tell me whither 
she went. She presently order’d me a Fire; so I 
went in, having Dr. Sibb’s Bowels with me to 
read. I read the two first Sermons, still no body 
came in: at last about 9. a-clock Mr. Jno. Eyre 
eame in; I took the opportunity to say to him 
as I had done to Mrs. Noyes before, that I hoped 
my Visiting his Mother would not be disagreeable 
to him; He answered me with much Respect. 
When twas after 9. a-clock He of himself said 
he would go and call her, she was but at one 
of his Brothers: A while after I heard Madam 
Winthrop’s voice, enquiring somthing about John. 
After a good while and Clapping the Garden door 
twice or thrice, she came in. I mention’d som- 
thing of the lateness; she banter’d me, and said 
I was later. She receiv’d me Courteously. I 
27
-P-A-G-E-41

  ask’d when our proceedings should be made pub- 
lick: She said They were like to be no more 
publick than they were already. Offer’d me no 
Wine that I remember. I rose up at 11 a-clock 
to come away, saying I would put on my Coat, 
She offer’d not to help me. I pray’d her that 
Juno might light me home, she open’d the Shut- 
ter, and said twas pretty light abroad; Juno was 
weary and gon to bed. So I came home by 
Star-light as well as I could. At my first coming 
in, I gave Sarah five Shillings. I writ Mr. Eyre 
his name in his book with the date October 21, 
1720. It cost me 8s. Jehovah jireh! Madam 
told me she had visited M. Mico, Wendell, and 
Wm. Glark of the South [Church]. 
October 22. Daughter Cooper visited me be- 
fore my going out of Town, staid till about Sun 
set. I brought her going near as far as the 
Orange Tree. Coming back, near Leg’s Corner, 
Little David Jeffries saw me, and looking upon 
me very lovingly, ask’d me if I was going to see 
his Grandmother? I said, Not to-night. Gave 
him a peny, and bid him present my Service to 
his Grandmother. 
October 24. I went in the Hackny Coach 
through the Common, stop’d at Madam Win- 
throp’s {had told her I would take my departure 
from thence), Sarah came to the door with 
Katee in her Arms: but I did not think to take 
notice of the Child. Call’d her Mistress. I told 
her, being encourag’d by David Jeffries loving 
eyes, and sweet Words, I was come to enquire 
whether she could find in her heart to leave 
that House and Neighbourhood, and go and dwell 
with me at the South-end; I think she said softly,

  Not yet. I told her It did not ly in my Lands 
to keep a Coach. If I should, I should be in 
danger to be brought to keep company with her 
Neighbour Brooker, (he was a little before sent 
to prison for Debt). Told her I had an Antipathy 
against those who would pretend to give them- 
selves; but nothing of their Estate. I would 
a proportion of my Estate with my self. And 
I supposed she would do go. As to a Perriwig, 
My best and greatest Friend, I could not possibly 
have a greater, began to find me with Hair before 
I was born, and had eontinued to do so ever 
since; and I could not find in my heart to go to 
another. She commended the book I gave her, 
Dr. Preston, the Church Marriage; quoted him 
saying ’twas inconvenient keeping out of 2 Fash- 
ion commonly used. I said the Time and Tide 
did cireumscribe my Visit, She gave me a Dram 
of Blaek-Cherry Brandy, and gave me a lump 
of the Sugar that was in it. She wish’d me a 
good Journy. I pray’d God to keep her, and 
came away. Had a very pleasant Journy to 
Salem. *

not go if I would.

of giving her a Hundred pounds per annum if 
I dy’d before her. Ask’d her what sum she 
would give me, if she should dy first? Said I 
would give her time to Consider of it. She said

by Deeds of Gift. I told her ‘twas a mistake, 
Point-Judith was mine &e. That in England I 
own’d, my Father’s desire was that it should go 
to my eldest Son; ’twas 20£ per annum; she 
thought ’twas forty. I think when I seem’d to 
excuse pressing this, she seemed to think twas 
best to speak of it; a long winter was coming 
on. Gave me a Glass or two of Canary. 
November 4. Friday, Went again, about 7. 
a-clock; found there Mr. John Walley and his 
wife: sat discoursing pleasantly. I shew’d them 
Igaac Moses’s [an Indian] Writing. Madam W. 
serv’d Comfeits to us. After a-while a Table was 
spread, end Supper was set. I urg’d Mr. Walley 
_ to Crave a Blessing; but he put it upon me. 
About 9. they went away. I ask’d Madam what 
fashioned Neck-lace I should present her with, 
She said, None at all. I ask’d her Whereabout 
we left off last time; mention’d what I had 
offer’d to give her; Ask’d her what she would 
give me; She said she could not Change her 
Condition: She had said so from the beginning; 
could not be so far from her Children, the Lee- 
ture. Quoted the Apostle Paul affirming that a 
single Life was better than a Married. I an- 
swered That: was for the present Distress. Said 
she had not pleasure in things of that nature as 
formerly: I said, you are the fitter to make me 
a Wife. If she held in that mind, I must go 
home and bewail my Rashness in making more 
haste than good Speed. However, considering 
the Supper, I desired her to be within next Mon- 
day night, if we liv’d so long. Assented. She 
charg’d me with saying, that she must put away 
Juno, if she came to me: I utterly deny’d it, it

it; saying it came in upon discourse about the 
Indian woman that obtained her Freedom this 
Court. About 10. I said I would not disturb the 
good orders of her House, and came away. She

Monday, November 7. My Son pray’d in 
the Old Chamber. Our time had been taken up 
by Son and Daughter Cooper’s Visit; so that 
I only read the 130th and 143. Psalm. Twas on 
the Account of my Courtship. I went to Mad. 
Winthrop; found her rocking her little Katee in 
the Cradle. I excus’d my Coming so late (near 
Eight). She set me an arm’d Chair and Cusheon; 
and so the Cradle was between her arm’d Chair 
and mine. Gave her the remnant of my Almonds; 
She did not eat of them as before; but laid them 
away; I said I came to enquire whether she 
had alter’d her mind since Friday, or remained 
of the same mind still. She said, Thereabouts. 
I told her I loved her, and was so fond as to 
think that she loved me: she said had a great 
respect for me. I told her, I had made her an 
offer, without asking any advice; she had so many 
to advise with, that ’twas an hindrance. The 
Fire was come to one short Brand besides the 
Block, which Brand was set up in end; at last 
it fell to pieces, and no Recruit was made: She 
gave me a glass of Wine. I think I repeated 
again that I would go home and bewail my Rash- 
ness in making more haste than good Speed. I 
would endeavor to contain myself, and not go 
on to sollicit her to do that which she could not

the steps she bid me have a care. Treated me 
Courteously. Told her she had enter’d the 4th 
year of her Widowhood. I had given her the

her Glove as sometime I had done. Her Dress 
was not so clean as somtime it had been. Jehovah

Stoddard’s: were so kind as to enquire of me 
if they should invite Madam Winthrop; I an- 
swer’d No. Thank’d my Sister Stoddard for her 
Courtesie. Had a noble Treat. At night our 
Meeting was at the Widow Belknap’s. Gave each 
one of the Meeting One of Mr. Holmes’s Ser- 
mons, 12 in all; She sent her servant home with 
me with a Lantern. Madam Winthrop’s Shutters

He that will write of Eliot must write of 
eharity, or say nothing. His charity was a star 
of the first magnitude in the bright constellation 
of his vertues, and the rays of it were wonder- 
fully various and extensive. His liberality to 
pious uses, whether publick or private, went much 
beyond the proportions of his little estate in the 
world. Many hundreds of pounds did he freely 
bestow upon the poor; and he would, with a very 
forcible importunity, press his neighbors to join 
with him in such beneficences. It was a mar- 
velous alacrity with which he imbraced all oppor- 
tunities of relieving any that were miserable; 
and the good people of Roxbury doubtless cannot 
remember (but the righteous God will!) how

  often, and with what ardors, with what argu- 
ments, he became a beggar to them for collections 
in their assemblies, to support such needy objects 
as had fallen under his observation. The poor 
counted him their father, and repaired still unto 
him with a filial confidence in their necessities ; 
and they were more than seven or eight, or 
indeed than so many scores, who received their 
portions of his bounty. Like that worthy and 
famous English general, he could not perswade 
himself ‘‘that he had anything but what he gave 
away,’’ but he drove a mighty trade at such 
exercises as he thought would furnish him with 
bills of exchange, which he hoped ‘‘after many 
days’’ to find the comfort of; and yet, after all, he 
would say, like one of the most charitable souls 
that ever lived in the world, ‘‘that looking over 
his aecounts he could nowhere find the God of 
heaven charged a debtor there.’? He did not put 
off his charity to be put in his last will, as many 
who therein shew that their charity is against 
their will; but he was his own administrator; 
he made his own hands his executors, and his 
own eyes his overseers. It has been remarked 
‘that liberal men are often long-lived men; so do 
they after many days find the bread with whieh 
they have been willing to keep other men alive. 
The great age of our Eliot was but agreeable to 
this remark; and when his age had unfitted him 
for almost all employments, and bereaved him 
of those gifts and parts which once he had been 
accomplished with, being asked, ‘‘How he did?’’ 
he would sometimes answer, ‘‘Alas, I have lost 
everything; my understanding leaves me, my 
memory fails me, my utterance fails me; but, I

COTTON MATHER 
  
thank God, my charity holds out still; I find that 
rather grows than fails!’? And I make no ques- 
tion, that at his death his happy soul was re- 
ceived and welcomed into the ‘‘everlasting hab- 
itations,’’ by many scores got thither before him, 
of such as his charity had been liberal unto. 
But besides these more substantial expressions 
of his charity, he made the odors of that grace 
yet more fragrant unto all that were about him, 
by that pitifulness and that peaceableness which 
rendered him yet further amiable. If any of his 
neighborhood were in distress, he was like a 
‘‘brother born for their adversity,’’ he would 
visit them, and comfort them with a most frater- 
nal sympathy; yea, tis not easy to recount how 
many whole days of prayer and fasting he has 
got his neighbors to keep with him, on the behalf 
of those whose calamities he found himself touched 
withal. It was an extreme satisfaction to him 
that his wife had attained unto a considerable 
skill in physick and chirurgery, which enabled 
her to dispense many safe, good and useful med- 
ieines unto the poor that had occasion for them; 
and some hundreds of sick and weak and maimed 
people owed praises to God for the benefit which 
therein they freely received of her. The good 
gentleman her husband would still be easting oil 
into the flame of that charity, wherein she was 
of her own accord abundantly forward thus to 
be doing of good unto all; and he would urge 
her to be serviceable unto the worst enemies that 
he had in the world. Never had any man fewer 
enemies than he! but once having delivered some- 
thing in his ministry which displeased one of his 
hearers, the man did passionately abuse him for 
35
-P-A-G-E-49
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  it, and this both with speeches and with writings 
that reviled him. Yet it happening not long after 
that this man gave himself a very dangerous 
wound, Mr. Eliot immediately sends his wife to 
eure him; who did accordingly. When the man 
was well, he came to thank her, but she took 
no rewards;.and this good man made him stay 
and eat. with him, taking no notice of all the 
ealumnies with which he had loaded him; but 
by this carriage he mollified and conquered the 
stomach of his reviler. 
He was also a great enemy to all contention, 
and would ring aloud courfeu bell wherever he 
saw the fires of animosity. When he heard any 
ministers complain that such and such in their 
flocks were too difficult for them, the strain of his 
answer still was, ‘‘Brother, compass them!’’ and 
“Brother, learn the meaning of those three little 
words, bear, forbear, forgive.’’ Yea, his inclina- 
tions for peace, indeed, sometimes almost made 
him to sacrifice right itself. When there was laid 
before an assembly of ministers a bundle of pa- 
pers which contained certain matters of difference 
and contention between some people which our 
Eliot thought should rather unite, with an am- 
nesty upon all their former quarrels, he (with 
some imitation of what Constantine did upon 
the like occasion) hastily threw the papers into 
the fire before them all, and, with a zeal for peace 
as hot as that fire, said immediately, ‘‘Brethren, 
wonder not at what I have done; I did it on my 
knees this morning before I came among you.’’ 
Such an excess (if it were one) flowed from his 
charitable inclinations to be found among those 
peace-makers which, by following the example of 
36
-P-A-G-E-50
  COTTON MATHER 
  that Man who is our peace, come to be called 
‘‘the children of God.’? Very worthily might he 
be called an Irengus as being all for peace; and 
the commendation which Epiphanius gives unto 
the ancient of that name, did belong unto our 
Eliot; he was ‘‘a most blessed and a most holy 
man.’’ He disliked all sorts of bravery; but yet 
with an ingenious note upon the Greek word in 
Col. iii. 15, he propounded, ‘‘that peace might 
brave it among us.’’ In short, wherever he came, 
it was like another old John, with solemn and 
earnest persuasives to love; and when he could 
say little else he would give that charge, ‘‘My 
children, love one another!’’ 
Finally, ’twas his charity which disposed him 
to continual apprecations for, and benedictions 
on those that he met withal; he had an heart 
full of good wishes and a mouth full of kind 
blessings for them. And he often made his ex- 
pressions very wittily agreeable to the cireum- 
stances which he saw the persons in. Sometimes 
when he eame into a family, he would eall for 
all the young people in it, that so he might very 
distinctly lay his holy hands upon every one of 
them, and bespeak the mercies of heaven for 
them all.

WILLIAM BYRD 
Born in Virginia in 1674, died in 1744; educated in Eng- 
land and the Netherlands; visited the court of France; 
chosen a Fellow of the Royal Society; receiver-general of the revenue in Virginia and three times colenial agent for 
Virginia in England; for thirty-seven years member, and 
finally president, of the Council of Virginia; his home in 
Virginia the famous ancestral seat called Westover. 
AT THE HOME OF COLONEL SPOTS- 
woop" 
Sept., 1732. Colonel Spotswood’s enchanted 
eastle is on one side of the street, and a baker’s 
dozen of ruinous tenements on the other, where 
so many German families had dwelt some years 
ago; but are now removed ten miles higher, in 
the Fork of Rappahannock, to land of their own. 
There had also been a chapel about a bow-shot 
from the colonel’s house, at the end of an avenue 
of cherry trees, but some pious people had lately 
burned it down, with intent to get another built 
1BProm “A Progress to the Mines,” the date of the visit 
being 1732, which was the year in which Washington was 
born. Byrd’s work is one of several admired writings by 
Byrd, now known collectively as the ‘Westover Manuscripts’? 
Colonel Spotswood, of whom Byrd here writes, in early 
life had been a soldier under Marlborough, and in 1710 
Governor of Virginia. In 1714, on his appointment to 
command a British expedition to the West Indies, he was 
made a major-general, but he died before embarking. He 
maintained fine establishments at Yorktown and on the 
Rapidan.

nearer to their own homes. Here I arrived about 
three o’clock, and found only Mrs. Spotswood at 
home, who received her old acquaintance with many 
a gracious smile. I was carried into a room 
elegantly set off with pier glasses, the largest of 
which came soon after to an odd misfortune. 
Amongst other favorite animals that cheered this 
lady’s solitude, a brace of tame deer ran famil- 
iarly about the house, and one of them ‘came to 
stare at me as a stranger. But unluckily spying 
his own figure in the glass, he made a spring 
over the tea-table that stood under it, and shat- 
tered the glass to pieces, and falling back upon 
the tea-table made a terrible fracas among the 
china. 
This exploit was so sudden, and accompanied 
with such a noise, that it surprized me, and per- 
fectly frightened Mrs. Spotswood. But ’twas 
worth all the damage to show the moderation and 
good humor with which she bore this disaster. 
In the evening the noble colonel came home from 
his mines, who saluted me very civilly, and Mrs. 
Spotswood’s sister, Miss Theky, who had been 
to meet him en cavalier, was so kind too as to 
bid me welcome. We talked over a legend of 
old stories, supped about 9, and then prattled 
with the ladies, till it was time for a traveler to 
retire. In the mean time I observed my old 
friend to be very uxorious, and exceedingly fond 
of his childreu. This was so opposite to the 
maxims he used to preach up before he was mar- 
ried, that I could not forbear rubbing up the 
memory of them. But he gave a very good- 
natured turn to his change of sentiments by al- 
leging that whoever brings a poor gentlewoman 
39
-P-A-G-E-53
  ‘THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  into so solitary a place, from all her friends and 
acquaintance, would be ungrateful not to use her 
and all that belongs to her with all possible 
tenderness. 
We all kept snug in our several apartments 
till nine, except Miss Theky, who was the house- 
wife of the family. At that hour we met over 
a pot of coffee, which was not quite strong enough 
to give us the palsy. After breakfast the colonel 
and I left the ladies to their domestie affairs, 
and took a turn in the garden, which has nothing 
beautiful but three terrace walks that fall in 
slopes one below another. I let him understand 
that, besides the pleasure of paying him a visit, 
I came to be instructed by so great a master in 
the mystery of making of iron, wherein he had led 
the way, and was the Tubal Cain of Virginia. 
He corrected me a little there, by assuring me 
he was not only the first in this country, but the 
first in North America who had erected a regular 
furnace. That they ran altogether upon bloom- 
eries in New England and Pennsylvania till his 
example had made them attempt greater works. 
But in this last colony they have so few ships 
to carry their iron to Great Britain that they 
must be content to make it only for their own 
use, and must be obliged to manufacture it when 
they have done. That he hoped he had done the 
country very great service by setting so good an 
example. . . - 
Qur conversation on this subject continued till 
dinner, which was both elegant and plentiful. 
The afternoon was devoted to the ladies, who 
showed me one of their most beautiful walks. 
They conducted me through a shady lane to the 
40
-P-A-G-E-54
  WILLIAM BYRD 
  landing, and by the way made me drink some 
very fine water that issued from a marble foun- 
tain, and ran incessantly. Just behind it was 
a covered bench, where Miss Theky often sat and 
bewailed her virginity. Then we proceeded to 
the river, which is the south branch of Rappa- 
hannock, about fifty yards wide, and so rapid 
that the ferry boat is drawn over by a chain, 
and therefore called the Rapidan. At night we 
drank prosperity to all the colonel’s projects in 
a bowl of rack punch, and then retired to our 
devotions. 
Having employed about two hours in retire- 
ment, I sallied out at the first summons to break- 
fast, where our conversation with the ladies, like 
whip syllabub, was very pretty, but had nothing 
in it. This, it seems, was Miss Theky’s birthday, 
upon which I made her my compliments, and 
wished she might live twice as long a married 
woman as she had lived a maid. I did not 
presume to pry into the secret of her age, nor was 
she forward to disclose it, for this humble reason, 
lest I should think her wisdom fell short of her 
years. 2. . 
We had a Michaelmas goose for dinner, of Miss 
Theky’s own raising, who was now good-natured 
enough to forget the jeopardy of her dog, In 
the afternoon we walked in a meadow by the 
river side, which winds in the form of a horse- 
shoe about Germanna, making it a peninsula 
containing about four hundred acres. Rappa- 
hannock forks about fourteen miles below this 
place, the northern branch being the larger, and 
consequently must be the river that bounds my 
Lord Fairfax’s grant of the northern neck. 
41
-P-A-G-E-55
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  The sun rose clear this morning, and so did I, 
and finished all my little affairs by breakfast. 
It was then resolved to wait on the ladies on 
horseback, since the bright sun, the fine air, and 
the wholesome exercise, all invited us to it. We 
forded the river a little above the ferry, and 
rode six miles up the neck to a fine level piece of 
rich land, where we found about twenty plants 
of ginseng, with the scarlet berries growing ou 
the top of the middle stalk. The root of this 
is of wonderful virtue in many cases, particularly 
to raise the spirits and promote perspiration, 
which makes it a specifie in colds and coughs. 
The colonel complimented me with all we found, 
in return for my telling him the virtues of it. 
We were all pleased to find so much of this king 
of plants so near the colonel’s habitation, and 
growing, too, upon his own land; but were, how- 
ever surprized to find it. upon level ground, after 
we had been told it grew only upon the north 
side of Stony Mountains. I carried home this 
treasure with as much joy as if every root had 
been a graft of the Tree of Life, and washed and 
dried it carefully. This airing made us as hungry 
as so many hawks, so that between appetite and 
a very good dinner, ’twas difficult to eat like a 
philosopher. In the afternoon the ladies walked. 
me about amongst all their little animals, with 
which they amuse themselves, and furnish the 
table; the worst of it is, they are so tender- 
hearted they shed a silent tear every time any 
of them are killed. At night the colonel and I 
quitted the threadbare subject of iron, and 
changed the scene to polities. He told me the 
ministry had receded from their demand upon

all sueceeding governors, for fear some curious 
members of the House of Commons should in- 
quire how the money was disposed of that had 
been raised in the other American colonies for 
the support of their governors. 
Our conversation was interrupted by a sum- 
mons to supper, for the ladies, to show their 
power, had by this time brought us tamely to 
go to bed with our bellies full, tho we both at 
first declared positively against it. So very 
pliable a thing is frail man, when women have 
the bending of him.

OF LIBERTY AND MORAL AGENCIES? 
Tue plain and obvious meaning of the words 
freedom and liberty, in common speech, is 
power, opportunity, or advantage, that any one 
has, to do as he pleases. Or, in other words, 
his being free from hindrance or impediment in 
the way of doing, or conducting in any respect, 
as he wills. (I say not only doing, but econ- 
ducting; because a voluntary forbearing to do, 
sitting still, keeping silence, ete., are instances 
of persons’ conduct, about which liberty is ex- 
ercised; tho they are not so properly called 
1¥From “The Freedom of the Will.” Tt is not alone as 
a contribution to theology that this work has been much 
admired. It is probably the most famous theological treatise 
yet produced in America; one writer has called it ‘one of 
the most famous philosophical works in the world.” But 
as an intellectual achievement solely, and for the perfection 
of its style, it has been quite ae generally praised. 
44
-P-A-G-E-58
  JONATHAN EDWARDS 
  doing.) And the contrary to Liberty, whatever 
name we call that by, is a person’s being hin- 
dered or unable to conduct as he will, or being 
necessitated to do otherwise. 
If this which I have mentioned be the meaning 
of the word liberty, in the ordinary use of lan- 
guage; as I trust that none that has ever learned 
to talk, and is unprejudiced, will deny: then it 
will follow that in propriety of speech neither 
liberty, nor its contrary, can properly be ascribed 
to any being or thing but that which has such 
a faculty, power or property as is called will. 
For that which is possest of no such thing as 
will, can not have any power or opportunity of 
doing according to its will, nor be necessitated 
to act contrary to its will, nor be restrained 
from acting agreeably to it. And therefore to 
talk of liberty, or the contrary, as belonging 
to the very will itself is not to speak good sense; 
if we judge of sense and nonsense by the original 
and proper signification of words. For the will 
itself is not an agent that has a will: the power 
of choosing itself has notea power of choosing. 
That which has the power of volition or choice 
is the man or the soul, and not the power of 
volition itself. And he that has the liberty of 
doing according to his will, is the agent or doer 
who is possest of the will; and not the will which 
he is possest of. We say with propriety that 
a bird let loose has power and liberty % fly; 
but not that the bird’s power of flying has a 
power and liberty of flying. To be free is the 
property of an agent, who is possest of powers 
and faculties, as much as to be cunning, valiant, 
bountiful, or zealous. But these qualities are the 
45
-P-A-G-E-59
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  
properties of men or persons and not the prop- 
erties of properties. 
There are two things that are contrary to this 
which is called liberty in common speech. One 
is constraint; the same is otherwise called force, 
compulsion, and coaction; which is a person’s being 
necessitated to do a thing contrary to his will. 
The other is restraint; whieh is his being hin- 
dered, and not having power to do according to 
his will. But that which has no will, can not 
be the subject of these things. I need say the 
* Jess on this head, Mr. Locke having set the same 
thing forth, with so great clearness, in his ‘‘Essay 
on the Human Understanding.’’ 
But one thing more I would observe concerning 
what is vulgarly called liberty; namely, that 
power and opportunity for one to do and conduct 
as he will, or according to his choice, is all that 
is meant by it; without taking into the meaning 
of the word anything of the cause or original 
of that choice; or at all considering how the 
person came to have such a volition; whether 
it was caused by some external motive or in- 
ternal habitual bias; whether it was determined 
by some internal antecedent volition, or whether 
it happened without a cause; whether it was nee- 
essarily connected with something foregoing, or 
not conneeted. Let the person come by his voli- 
tion or choice how he will, yet, if he is able, 
and there is nothing in the way to hinder his 
pursuing and executing his will, the man is fully 
and perfectly free, according to the primary and 
eommon notion of freedom. 
‘What has been said may be sufficient to show 
what is meant by liberty, according to the com- 
46
-P-A-G-E-60
  JONATHAN EDWARDS 
  mon notions of mankind, and in the usual and 
primary acceptation of the word: but the word, 
as used by Arminians, Pelagians and others, who 
oppose the Calvinists, has an entirely different 
signification. These several things belong to their 
notion of liberty. 1. That it consists in a self- 
determining power in the will, or a certain sov- 
ereignty the will has over itself, and its own 
acts, whereby it determines its own volitions; 
so as not to be dependent, in its determinations, 
on any cause without itself, nor determined by 
anything prior to its own acts. 2. Indifference 
belongs to liberty in their notion of it, or that 
the mind, previous to the act of volition, be in 
equilibrio. 3. Contingence is another thing that 
belongs and is essential to it; not in the common 
acceptation of the word, as that has been already 
explained, but as opposed to all necessity, or any 
fixt and certain connection with some previous 
ground or reason of its existence. They suppose 
the-essence of liberty so much to consist in these 
things that unless the will of man be free in 
this sense, he has no real freedom, how much 
soever he may be at liberty to act according to 
his will. 
A moral agent is a being that is capable of 
those actions that have a moral quality, and 
which can properly be denominated good or evil 
in a moral sense, virtuous or vicious, commend- 
able or faulty. To moral agency belongs a moral 
faeulty, or sense of moral good and evil, or of 
such a thing as desert or worthiness, of praise 
or blame, reward or punishment; and a capacity 
which an agent has of being influenced in his 
actions by moral inducements or motives, ex-

  hibited to the view of understanding and reason, 
to engage to a conduct agreeable to the moral 
faculty. 
The sun is very excellent and beneficial in its 
action and influence on the earth, in warming 
it, and causing it to bring forth its fruits; but 
it is not a moral agent. Its action, tho good, is 
not virtuous or meritorious. Fire that breaks 
out in a city, and consumes great part of it, is 
very mischievous in its operation; but is not a 
moral agent. What it does is not faulty or sin- 
ful, or deserving of any punishment. The brute 
ereatures are not moral agents. The actions of 
some of them are very profitable and pleasant; 
others are very hurtful; yet, seeing they have 
no moral faculty, or sense of desert, and do not 
act from choice guided by understanding, or with 
a capacity of reasoning and reflecting, but only 
from instinet, and are not capable of being in- 
fluenced by mora] inducements, their actions are 
not properly sinful cr virtuous; nor are they 
properly the subjects of any such moral treatment 
for what they do, as moral agents are for their 
faults or good deeds. 
Here it may be noted that there is a cireum- 
stantial difference between the moral agency of 
a ruler and a subject. I call it circumstantial, 
because it lies only in the difference of moral 
inducements they are capable of being influenced 
by, arising from the difference of circumstances. 
A ruler, acting in that capacity only, is not 
eapable of being influenced by a moral law, and 
its sanctions of threatenings and promises, re- 
wards and punishments as the subject is; tho 
both may be influenced by a knowledge of moral 
48

  good and evil. And therefore the moral agency 
of the Supreme Being, who acts only in the ¢a- 
pacity of a ruler toward His creatures, and never 
as a subject, differs in that respect from the 
moral agency of created intelligent beings. God’s 
actions, and particularly those which are to be 
attributed to Him as moral governor, are morally 
good in the highest degree. They are most per- 
fectly holy and righteous; and we must conceive 
of Him as influenced in the highest degree by 
that which, above all others, is properly a moral 
indueement, viz., the moral good which He sees 
in such and such things: and therefore He is, 
in the most proper sense, a moral agent, the 
source of all moral ability and agency, the foun- 
tain and rule of all virtue and moral good; tho 
by reason of His being supreme over all, it is 
not possible He should be under the influence of 
law or command, promises or threatenings, re- 
wards or punishments, counsels or warnings. The 
essential qualities of a moral agent are in God, 
in the greatest possible perfection; such as un- 
derstanding, to perceive the difference between 
moral good and evil; a capacity of discerning 
that moral worthiness and demerit, by which 
some things are praiseworthy, others deserving 
of blame and punishment; and also a capacity 
of choice, and choice guided by understanding, 
and a power of acting according to his choice 
or pleasure, and being capable of doing those 
things which are in the highest sense praise- 
worthy. And herein does very much consist that 
image of God wherein He made man (which we 
read of Gen. i. 26, 27, and chapter ix. 6), by 
which God distinguishes man from the beasts,

viz., in those faculties and principles of nature, 
whereby he is capable of moral agency. Herein 
very much consists the natural image of God; 
as His spiritual and moral image, wherein man 
was made at first, consisted in that moral ex- 
cellency, that he was endowed with.

HIS FIRST ENTRY INTO PHILADELPHIA’ 
(1729). 
I nave been the more particular in this de- 
scription of my journey, and shall be so of my 
first entry into that city, that you may in your 
mind compare such unlikely beginnings with the 
figure I have since made there. I was in my 
working dress, my best clothes being to come 
round by sea. I was dirty from my journey; my 
pockets were stuffed out with shirts and stock- 
ings, and I knew no soul nor where to look for 
lodging. I was fatigued with traveling, rowing 
and want of rest, I was very hungry; and my 
whole stock of cash consisted of a Dutch dollar, 
and about a shilling in eopper. The latter I gave

  the people of the boat for my passage, who at 
first refused it, on account of my rowing; but 
I insisted on their taking it. A man being some- 
times more generous when he has but a little 
money than when he has plenty, perhaps through 
fear of being thought to have but little. 
Then I walked up the street, gazing about till 
near the market-house I met a boy with bread. 
I had made many a meal on bread, and, inquiring 
where he got it, I went immediately to the baker’s 
he directed me to, in Second street, and asked 
for biscuit, intending such as we had in Boston; 
but they, it seems, were not made in Philadelphia, 
Then I asked for a three-penny loaf, and was 
told they had none such. So, not considering 
or knowing the difference of money, and the 
greater cheapness nor the names of his bread, 
I had him give me three pennyworth of any 
sort. He gave me, accordingly, three great puffy 
rolls. I was surprized at the quantity, but took 
it, and, having no room in my pockets, walked 
eff with a roll under each arm, and eating the 
other. Thus I went up Market street as far as 
Fourth street, passing by the door of Mr. Read, 
my future wife’s father;* when she, standing 
at the door, saw me, and thought I made, as TF 
certainly did, a most awkward, ridiculous ap-

illustration of her limited education. It was saddrest to 
Franklin while he was in England, being dated “October 
ye 11, 1770”:

  pearance. Then I turned and went down Chest- 
nut street and part of Walnut street, eating my 
roll all the way, and, coming round, found myself 
again at Market street wharf, near the boat I 
came in, to which I went for a draft of the river 
water; and, being filled with one of my rolls, 
gave the other two to a woman and her child 
that came down the river in the boat with us, 
and were waiting to go farther. 
Thus refreshed, I walked again up the street, 
which by this time had many clean-drest people 
in it, who were all walking the same way. I 
joined them, and thereby was led into the great 
meeting-house of the Quakers near the market. 
Isat down among them, and, after looking round 
awhile and hearing nothing said, being very 
drowsy through labor and want of rest the pre- 
eeding night, I fell fast asleep, and continued 
so till the meeting broke up, when one was kind 
enough to rouse me. This was, therefore, the 
first house I was in, or slept in, in Philadelphia. 
Walking down again toward the river, and, 
looking in the faces of people, I met a young 
Quaker man, whose countenance I liked, and, 
accosting him, requested he would tell me where 
a stranger could get lodging. We were then near 
the sign of the Three Mariners. ‘‘Here,’’ says 
he, ‘‘is one place that entertains strangers, but

it is not a reputable house; if thee wilt walk 
with me, I’ll show thee a better.’ He brought 
me to the Crooked Billet in Water street. Here 
I got a dinner; and, while I was eating it, several 
sly questions were asked me, as it seemed to be 
suspected, from my youth and appearance, that 
I might be some runaway. 
After dinner, my host having shown me to a 
bed, I laid myself on without undressing, and 
slept till six in the evening, when I was called 
to supper. I went to bed again very early, and 
slept very soundly till next morning. Then I 
drest myself as neat as I could, and went to 
Andrew Bradford the printer’s. I found in the 
shop the old man his father, whom I had seen 
at New York, and who, traveling on horseback, 
had got to Philadelphia before me. He intro- 
duced me to his son, who received me civilly, 
gave me a breakfast, but told me he did not at 
present want a hand, being lately supplied with 
one; but there was another printer in town, lately 
set up, one Keimer, who, perhaps, might employ 
me; if not, I should be welcome to lodge at his 
house, and he would give me a little work to do 
now and then till fuller business should offer.

WARNINGS BRADDOCK DID NOT HEED* 
THs general [Braddock] was, I think, a brave 
man, and might probably have made a figure as 
a good officer in some European war. But he 
had too much self-confidence, too high an opinion 
of the validity of regular troops, and too mean 
a one of both Americans and Indians. George 
Croghan,‘ our Indian interpreter, joined him on 
his march with one hundred of those people, who 
might have been of great use to his army as 
guides, scouts, etc., if he had treated them kindly; 
but he slighted and neglected them, and they 
gradually left him. 
In conversation with him one day he was giving 
me some account of his intended progress. ‘‘Af- 
ter taking Fort Duquesne,’’” says he, ‘I am to 
proceed to Niagara; and, having taken that, to 
*From Chapter X of the “Autobiography.” 
4Croghan afterward became associated closely with Sir 
William Johnson in the Mohawk and Upper Susquehanna 
Valleys. He acquired title to a large tract of land at the 
foot of Otsego Lake, but, while settling it, mortgaged the 
land heavily, and eventually lost it through foreclosure. 
‘William Cooper, father of the novelist, subsequently obtained 
title to these Jands and went into the country to settle 
them, In the course of his labors, he founded the village 
of Cooperstown, and made it bis home. It was this’ circum- 
stance which led to Fenimore Cooper's knowledge of Indian 
and frontier life as depicted in his writings. The home 
of William Cooper had previously been in Burlington, N. J. 
SNow Pittsburg.

Frontenac, if the season will allow time; and 
I suppose it will, for Duquesne can hardly detain 
me above three or four days; and then I see 
nothing that ean obstruet my march to Niagara.’” 
Having before revolved in my mind the long line 
his army must make in their march by a very 
narrow road, to be eut for them through the 
woods and bushes, and also what I had read of 
a former defeat of fifteen hundred French, who 
invaded the Iroquois country, I had conceived 
some doubts and some fears for the event of the 
campaign. But I ventured only to say, ‘‘To be 
sure, sir, if you arrive well before Duquesne, with 
these fine troops, so well provided with artillery, 
that place, not yet completely fortified and as 
we hear with no very strong garrison, can prob- 
ably make but a short resistance. The only dan- 
ger I apprehend of obstruction to your march 
is from ambuseades of Indians, who, by constant 
practise, are dextrous in laying and executing 
them; and the slender line, near four miles long, 
which your army must make, may expose it to 
be attacked by surprize in its flanks, and to be 
eut like a thread into several pieces, which, from 
their distance, can not come up in time to sup- 
port each other.’’ 
He smiled at my ignoranee, and replied, ‘‘ These 
savages may, indeed, be a formidable enemy to 
your raw American militia, but upon the King’s 
regular and disciplined troops, sir, it is impos- 
sible they should make any impression.’’ I was 
@%n early times commonly called Fort Frontenac, bot now 
Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The name was changed te 
Kingston by Loyalists who settled at the fort after the 
American Revolution.

  conscious of an impropriety in my disputing with 
a military man in matters of his profession, and 
said no more. The enemy, however, did not take 
advantage of his army which I apprehended its 
long line of march exposed it to, but let it ad- 
vanee without interruption till within nine miles 
of the place; and then, when more in a body 
(for it had just passed a river, where the front 
had halted till all were come over), and in a more 
open part of the woods than any it had passed, 
attacked its advanced guard by a heavy fire from 
behind trees and bushes, which was the first 
intelligence the general had of an enemy’s being 
near him. This guard being disordered, the gen- 
eral hurried the troops up to their assistance, 
which was done in great confusion, through 
wagons, baggage, and cattle; and presently the 
fire came upon their flank: the officers, being on 
horseback, were more easily distinguished, picked 
out as marks, and fell very fast; and the soldiers 
were crowded together in a huddle, having or 
hearing no orders, and standing to be shot at 
till two-thirds of them were killed; and then, 
being seized with a panic, the whole fied with 
precipitation. 
The wagoners took each a horse out of his 
team and seampered; their example was imme- 
diately followed by others; so that all the wag- 
ons, provisions, artillery, and stores were left to 
the enemy. The general, being wounded, was 
brought off with difficulty; his secretary, Mr. 
Shirley, was killed by his side; and out of eighty- 
six officers, sixty-three were killed or wounded, 
and seven hundred and fourteen men killed out 
of eleven hundred. These eleven hundred had 
57
-P-A-G-E-71
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  been picked men from the whole army; the rest 
had been left behind with Colonel Dunbar, who 
was to follow with the heavier part of the stores, 
provisions, and baggage. The flyers, not being 
pursued, arrived at Dunbar’s camp, and the panic 
they brought with them instantly seized him and 
all his people; and, tho he had now above one 
thousand men, and the enemy who had beaten 
Braddock did not at most exceed four hundred 
Indians and French together, instead of proeeed- 
ing, and endeavoring to recover some of the lost 
honor, he ordered all the stores, ammunition, ete., 
to be destroyed, that he might have more horses 
to assist his flight toward the settlements, and 
less lumber to remove. He was there met with 
requests from the governors of Virginia, Mary- 
land and Pennsylvania that he would post his 
troops on the frontiers, so as to afford some pro- 
tection to the inhabitants; but he continued his 
hasty march through all the country, not thinking 
himself safe till he arrived at Philadelphia, where 
the inhabitants could protect him. This whole 
transaction gave us Americans the first suspicion 
that our exalted ideas of the prowess of British 
regulars had not been well founded, 
In their first march, too, from their landing 
till they got beyond the settlements, they had 
plundered and stript the inhabitants, totally ruin- 
ing some poor families, besides insulting, abusing, 
and confining the people if they remonstrated. 
This was enough to put us out of conceit of such 
defenders, if we had really wanted any. How 
different was the conduct of our French friends 
in 1781, who, during a march through the most 
inhabited part of our country, from Rhode Island

not the smallest complaint for the loss of a pig,

HOW TO DRAW LIGHTNING FROM THE 
CLOUDS’ 
As frequent mention is made in public papers 
from Europe of the success of the Philadelphia 
experiment for drawing the electric fire from 
elouds by means of pointed rods of iron erected 
on high buildings, ete., it may be agreeable to 
the curious to be informed that the same experi- 
ment has succeeded in Philadelphia, tho made 
in a different and more easy manner, which is 
as follows. + 
Make a small eross of two light strips of cedar, 
the arms so long as to reach to the four corners 
of a large thin silk handkerchief when extended; 
tie the corners of the handkerchief to the ex- 
tremities of the cross, so you have the body of 
a kite; which, being properly accommodated with 
a tail, loop, and string, will rise in the air, like 
those made of paper; but this being of silk is 
fitter to bear the wet and wind of a thunder-gust 
without tearing. To the top of the upright stick 
of the cross is to be fixt a very sharp-pointed 
wire, rising a foot or more above the wood. To

  the end of the twine, next the hand, is to be tied 
a silk ribbon, and where the silk and twine join, 
a key may be fastened. This kite is to be raised 
when a thunder-gust appears to be coming on, 
and the person who holds the string must stand 
within a door or window, or under some cover, 
so that the silk ribbon may not be wet; and care 
must be taken that the twine does not touch the 
frame of the door or window. As soon as any 
of the thunder-clouds come over the kite, the 
pointed wire will draw the electrie fire from them, 
and the kite, with all the twine, will be electrified, 
and the loose filaments of the twine will stand 
out every way, and be attracted by an approach- 
ing finger. And when the rain bas wetted the 
kite and twine, so that it ean conduct the electric 
fire freely, you will find it stream out plentifully 
from the key on the approach of your knuckle. 
At this key the vial may be charged; and from 
electric fire thus obtained, spirits may be kindled, 
and all the other electrie experiments be per- 
formed, which are usually done by the help of 
a rubbed glass globe or tube, and thereby the 
sameness of the electric matter with that of light- 
ning completely demonstrated.

THE WAY TO WEALTH® 
CourTEOUS reader: 
I have heard that nothing gives an author so 
great pleasure as to find his works respectfully 
quoted by others. Judge, then, how much I must 
have been gratified by an incident I am going 
to relate to you. I stopt my horse lately, where 
a great number of people were collected at an 
auction of merchants’ goods. The hour of the 
sale not being come, they were conversing on the 
badness of the times; and one of the company 
called to a plain, clean old man, with white 
locks, ‘‘Pray, Father Abraham, what think you 
of the times? Will not these heavy taxes quite 
ruin the country? How shall we ever be able 
to pay them? What would you advise us to do?’’ 
Father Abraham stood up and replied, ‘‘If 
you would have my advice, I will give it you 
in short; for “A word to the wise is enough,’ as 
Poor Richard says.’? They joined in desiring 
him to speak his mind, and gathering round him 
he proceeded as follows. 
‘*Friends,’’ said he, ‘‘the taxes are indeed very 
From “Poor Richard’s Almanac” for 1757, where it 
was printed as a preface signed “Richard Saunders.” Frank- 
lin began this Almanac in 1732. John Bigelow, Franklin's 
biographer and editor, says it “attained an astonishing pop- 
ularity.” For twenty-five years it had an average circula- 
tion of 10,000 copies. Sometimes it was sent to press as early as October in order to supply remote colonists in time 
for the new year. ‘Translations of it have been printed in 
nearly all written languages.

  heavy, and, if those laid on by the government 
were the only ones we had to pay, we might more 
easily discharge them; but we have many others, 
and much more grievous to some of us. We are 
taxed twice as much by our idleness, three 
times as much by our pride, and four times 
as much by our folly; and from these taxes the 
commissioners can not ease or deliver us by 
allowing an abatement. However, let us harken 
to good advice, and something may be done for 
us; ‘God helps them that help themselves,’ as 
Poor Richard says. 
“T. It would be thought a hard government 
that should tax its people one-tenth part of their 
time, to be employed in its service; but idleness 
taxes many of us much more; sloth, by bringing 
on diseases, absolutely shortens life. ‘Sloth, like 
rust, consumes faster than labor wears; while the 
used key is always bright,’ as Poor Richard 
says. ‘But dost thou love life, then do not squan- 
der time, for that is the stuff life is made of,’ 
as Poor Richard says. How muck more than is 
necessary do we spend in sleep, forgetting that 
‘The sleeping fox eatehes no poultry,’ and that 
‘There will be sleeping enough in the grave,’ as 
Poor Richard says. 
‘« ‘If time be of all things the most precious, 
wasting time must be,’ as Poor Richard says, ‘the 
greatest prodigality’; since, as he elsewhere tells 
us, ‘Lost time is never found again; and what 
we call time enough, always proves little enough.’ 
Let: us, then, up and be doing, and doing to the 
purpose; so by diligence shall we do more with 
less perplexity. Ei makes all things difficult, 
a but industry all é: and ‘He that riseth late

  must trot all day, and shall scarce overtake his 
business at night’; while ‘Laziness travels so 
slowly that Poverty soon overtakes him, Drive 
thy business, let not that drive thee’; and ‘Early 
to bed, and éarly to rise, makes a man healthy, 
wealthy, and wise,’ as Poor Richard says. . . 
‘‘Methinks I hear some of you say, ‘Must a 
man afford himself no leisure?’ I will tell thee, 
my friend, what Poor Richard says, ‘Employ thy 
time well, if thou meanest to gain leisure; and, 
since thou art not sure of a minute, throw not 
away an hour.’ Leisure is time for doing some- 
thing useful; this leisure the diligent man will 
obtain, but the lazy man never; for ‘A life of 
leisure and a life of laziness are two things. 
Many, without labor, would live by their wits 
only, but they break for want of stock’; whereas 
industry gives comfort, and plenty, and respect. 
‘Fly pleasures, and they will follow you. The 
diligent spinner has a large shift; and now I 
have a sheep and a cow, everybody bids me good 
morrow.’ 
“TI. But with our industry we must likewise 
be steady, settled, and careful, and oversee our 
own affairs with our own eye, and not trust too 
much to others; for, as Poor Richard says, 
‘T never saw an oft-removed tree, 
Nor yet an oft-removed family, 
That throve so well as those that settled be.’ 
And again, ‘Three removes are as bad as a fire’; 
and again, ‘Keep thy shop, and thy shop will 
keep thee’; and again, ‘If you would have your 
business done, go; if not, send.’ And again,

— ee 
‘He that by the plough would thrive, 
Himself must either hold or drive.’ 
And again, ‘The eye of a master will do more 
work than both his hands’; and again, ‘Want of 
eare does us more damage than want of knowl- 
edge’; and again, ‘Not toe oversee workmen, is to 
leave them your purse open.’ Trusting too much 
to others’ care is the ruin of many; for ‘In the 
affairs of this world men are saved not by faith, 
but by the want of it’; but a man’s own care is 
profitable; for ‘If you would have a faithful 
servant, and one that you like, serve yourself. 
A little negleet may breed great mischief; for 
want of a nail the shoe was lost; for want of 
a shoe the horse was lost; and for want of a 
horse the rider was lost, being overtaken and 
slain by the enemy; all for want of a little care 
about a horseshoe nail.’ 
“TIT. So much for industry, my friends, and 
attention to one’s own business; but to these we 
must add frugality, if we would make our in- 
dustry more certainly successful. A man may, 
if he knows not how to save as he gets, keep 
his nose all his life to the grindstone, and die 
not worth a groat at last. ‘A fat kitchen makes 
a lean will’; and 
“Many estates are spent in the getting, 
Since women for tea forsook spinning and 
knitting, 
And men for punch forsook hewing and 
splitting.’

as of. getting.) The Indies have not made Spain

  rich, because her outgoes are greater than her 
incomes.’ 
“Away, then, with your expensive follies, and 
you will not then have so much cause to complain 
of hard times, heavy taxes, and chargeable fam- 
ilies; for 
‘Women and wine, game and deceit, 
Make the wealth small and the want great.’ 
‘And further, ‘What maintains one vice would 
bring up two children.’ You may think, perhaps, 
that a little tea, or a little punch now and then, 
diet a little more costly, clothes a little finer, 
and a little entertainment now and then can be 
no great matter; but remember, ‘Many a little 
makes a mickle.’ Beware of little expenses; ‘A small leak will sink a great ship,’ as Poor Richard 
says; and again, ‘Who dainties love, shall beggars 
prove’; and moreover, ‘Fools makes feasts, and 
wise men eat them. . . . If you would know 
the value of money, go and try to borrow some; 
for he that goes a-borrowing goes a-sorrowing,’ 
as Poor Richard says; and, indeed, so does he 
that lends to such people, when he goes to get 
it in again. Poor Dick further advises, and says, 
‘Fond pride of dress is sure a very curse; 
Ere faney you consult, consult your purse.’ 
And again, ‘Pride is as loud a beggar as Want, 
and a great deal more saucy.” When you have 
bought one fine thing, you must buy ten more, 
that your appearance may be all of a piece; but 
Poor Dick says, ‘It is easier to suppress the first desire than to satisfy all that follow it.’ And it 
1x5 oo 65

  is as truly folly for the poor to ape the rich as 
for the frog to swell in order to equal the ox. 
‘Vessels large may venture more, 
But little boats should keep near shore.’ 
It is, however, a folly soon punished; for, as 
Poor Richard says, ‘Pride that dines on vanity 
sups on contempt. Pride breakfasted with Plen- 
ty, dined with Poverty, and supped with Infamy.’ 
And, after all, of what use is this pride of ap- 
pearance, for which so much is risked, so much 
is suffered? It can not promote health, nor ease 
pain; it makes no increase of merit in the per- 
son; it creates envy; it hastens misfortune. 
‘*But what madness must it be to run in debt 
for these superfiuities. . . . When you have 
got your bargain, you may, perhaps, think little 
of payment; but, as Poor Richard says, ‘Creditors 
have better memories than debtors; creditors are 
a superstitious sect, great observers of set days 
and times.’ The day comes round before you 
are aware, and the demand is made before you 
are prepared to satisfy it; or, if you bear your 
debt in mind, the term, which at first seemed so 
long, will, as it lessens, appear extremely short. 
Time will seem to have added wings to his heels 
as well as his shoulders. ‘Those have a short 
Lent who owe money to be paid at Haster.’? At 
present, perhaps, you may think yourselves in 
thriving circumstances, and that you can bear 
a little extravagance without injury; but 
‘For age and want save while you may; 
No morning sun lasts a whole day.’ 
66
-P-A-G-E-80
  BENJAMIN FRANKLIN 
  Gain may be temporary and uncertain, but ever, 
while you live, expense is constant and certain; 
and ‘It is easier to build two chimneys than to 
keep one in fuel,’ as Poor Richard says; so, 
‘Rather go to bed supperless than rise in debt.? 
‘Get what you can, and what you get hold; 
Tis the stone that will turn all your lead into 
gold.’ 
And when you have got the philosopher’s stone, 
sure you will no longer complain of bad times, 
or the difficulty of paying taxes. 
“TV. This doctrine, my friends, is reason and 
wisdom; but, after all, do not depend too munch 
upon your own industry, and frugality, and pru- 
dence, tho excellent things; for they may all be 
blasted without the blessing of Heaven; and, 
therefore, ask that blessing humbly, and be not 
uncharitable to those that at present seem to 
want it, but comfort and help them. Remember, 
Job suffered, and was afterward prosperous. 
‘And now, to conclude, ‘Experience keeps a 
dear school, but fools will learn in no other,’ as 
Poor Richard says, and searce in that; for, it is 
true, ‘We may give advice, but we can not give 
conduct.’ However, remember this, ‘They that 
will not be counseled, can not be helped;’ and 
further, that ‘If you will not hear Reason, she 
will surely rap your knuckles’ as Poor Richard 
says.’” 
Thus the old gentleman ended his harangue. 
The people heard it and approved the doctrine; 
and immediately practised the contrary, just as 
if it had been a common sermon; for the auction 
opened, and they began to buy extravagantly.

A DIALOG WITH THE GOUT 
[Dated at midnight, 22 October, 1780.] 
Franxuin. Eh! Oh! Eh! What have I done to 
merit these cruel sufferings? 
Gout. Many things; you have ate and drank 
too freely, and too much indulged those legs of 
yours in their indolence. 
Franklin. Who is it that accuses me? 
Gout. It is I, even I, the Gout. 
Franklin, What! my enemy in person? 
Gout. No, not your enemy. 
Franklin. I repeat it; my enemy; for you woule 
not only torment my body to death, but ruin my 
good name; you reproach me as a glutten and

  a tippler; now all the world that knows me will 
allow that I am neither the one nor the other. 
Gout. The world may think as it pleases; it is 
always. very complaisant to itself, and sometimes 
to its friends; but I very well know that the 
quantity of meat and drink proper for a man 
who takes a reasonable degree of exercise, would 
be too much for another, who never takes any. 
Franklin. I take—Eh! Oh!—as much exercise 
~-Eh!—as I can, Madam Gout. You know my 
sedentary state, and on that account, it would 
seem, Madam Gout, as if you might spare me 
a little, seeing it is not altogether my own fault. 
Gout. Not a jot; your rhetoric and your polite- 
ness are thrown away; your apology avails noth- 
ing. If your situation in life is a sedentary one, 
your amusements, your recreations, at least, 
should be active. You ought to walk or ride; or, 
if the weather prevents that, play at billiards. 
But let us examine your course of life. While 
the mornings are long, and you have leisure to 
go abroad, what do you do? Why, instead of 
gaining an appetite for breakfast, by salutary. 
exercise, you amuse yourself with books, pam- 
phiets, or newspapers, which commonly are not 
worth the reading. Yet you eat an inordinate 
breakfast, four dishes of tea, with eream, and 
one or two buttered toasts, with slices of hung 
beef, which I fancy are not things the most easily 
digested. Immediately afterward you sit down 
to write at your desk, or converse with persons 
who apply to you on business. Thus the time 
passes till one, without any kind of bodily exer- 
cise. 
But all this I could pardon, in regard, es 
69
-P-A-G-E-83
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  you say, to your sedentary condition. But what 
is your practise after dinner? Walking in the 
beautiful gardens of those friends with whom 
you have dined would be the choice of men of 
sense; yours is to be fixt down to chess, where 
you are found engaged for two or three hours! 
This is your perpetual recreation, which is the 
least eligible of any for a sedentary man, because, 
instead of accelerating the motion of the fluids, 
the rigid attention it requires helps to retard the 
cireulation and obstruct internal seeretions. 
Wrapt in the speculations of this wretched game, 
you destroy your constitution. What can be 
expected from such a course of living but a body 
replete with stagnant humors, ready to fall a 
prey to all kinds of dangerous maladies, if I, 
the Gout, did not occasionally bring you relief 
by agitating those humors, and so purifying or 
dissipating them? If it was in some nook or 
alley in Paris, deprived of walks, that you played 
awhile at chess after dinner, this might be ex- 
eusable; but the same taste prevails with you in 
Passy, Auteuil, Montmartre, or Sanoy, places 
where there are the finest gardens and walks, a 
pure air, beautiful women, and most agreeable 
and instructive conversation; all which you might 
enjoy by frequenting the walks. But these are 
rejected for this abominable game of chess. Fie, 
then, Mr. Franklin! But amidst my instructions, 
I had almost forgot to administer my wholesome 
corrections; so take that twinge—and that. 
Franklin. Oh! Eh! Oh! Obbh! As much in- 
struction as you please, Madam Gout, and as 
many reproaches; but pray, Madam, a truce with 
your corrections! 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  BENJAMIN FRANKLIN 
  Gout. No, Sir, no—I will not abate a particle 
of what is so much for your good—therefore— 
Franklin. Oh! Ehbh!—It is not fair to say I 
take no exercise, when I do very often, going out 
to dine and returning in my carriage. 
Gout. That, of all imaginable exercises, is the 
most slight and insignificant, if you allude to the 
motion of a carriage suspended on springs. By 
observing the degree of heat: obtained by different 
kinds of motion we may form an estimate of 
the quantity of exercise given by each: Thus, 
for example, if you turn out to walk in winter 
with cold feet, in an hour’s time you will be 
in a glow all over; ride on horseback, the same 
effect will scarcely be perceived by four hours’ 
round trotting; but if you loll in a earriage, such 
as you have mentioned, you may travel all day, 
and gladly enter the last inn to warm your feet 
by a fire. Flatter yourself then no longer that 
half an hour’s airing in your carriage deserves 
the name of exercise. Providence has appointed 
few to roll in carriages, while he has given to 
all a pair of legs, which are machines infinitely 
more commodious and serviceable. Be grateful, 
then, and make a proper use of yours. Would 
you know how they forward the circulation of 
your fluids, in the very action of transporting 
you from place to place; observe when you walk 
that all your weight is ‘alternately thrown from 
one leg to the other; this occasions a great pres- 
sure on the vessels of the foot, and repels their 
contents; when relieved, by the weight being 
thrown on the other foot, the vessels of the first 
are allowed to replenish, and, by a return of this 
weight, this repulsion again succeeds, thus ac- 
71
-P-A-G-E-85
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  celerating the circulation of the blood. The heat 
produced in any given time depends on the degree 
of this acceleration; the fluids are shaken, the 
humors attenuated, the secretions facilitated, and 
all goes well; the cheeks are ruddy, and health is 
established. Behold your fair friend at Au- 
teuil;° a lady who received from bounteous na- 
ture more really useful science than half a dozen 
of such pretenders to philosophy as you have been 
able to extract from all your books. When she 
honors you with a visit, it is on foot. She walks 
all hours of the day, and leaves indolence, and 
its concomitant maladies, to be endured by her 
horses. In this see at once the preservative of 
her health and personal charms. But when you 
go to Auteuil, you must have your earriage, tho 
it is no farther from Passy to Auteuil than from 
Auteuil to Passy. 
Franklin. Your reasonings grow very tiresome. 
Gout. I stand corrected. I will be silent and 
eontinue my office; take that, and that. . 
Franklin. Oh! Ohh! Talk on, I pray you. 
Gout. No, no; I have a good number of twinges 
for you to-night, and you may be sure of some 
more to-morrow. 
Franklin. What, with such a fever! I shall 
go distracted. Oh! Eh! Can no one bear it for 
me? 
*The reference is to Madame Helvetius, whom Franklin 
knew as the widow of the writer Claude Adrien Helvetius. 
Her home was long a center of literary society in France. 
The friendship with Franklin was # notable incident in his 
career as American Ambassador to France. See his. letter

  BENJAMIN FRANKLIN 
  Gout. Ask that of your horses; they have 
served you faithfully. 
Franklin. How can you so eruelly sport with 
my torments? 
Gout. Sport! I am very serious. I have here 
a list of offenses against your own health dis- 
tinetly written, and can justify every stroke in- 
flieted on you. 
Franklin. Read it then. 
Gout. It is too long a detail; but I will briefly 
mention some particulars. 
Franklin. Proceed. I am all attention. 
Gout. Do you remember how often you have 
promised yourself, the following morning, a walk 
in the grove of Boulogne, in the garden de la 
Muette, or in your own garden, and have violated 
your promise, alleging at one time it was too 
cold, at another too warm, too windy, too moist, 
or what else you pleased; when in truth it was 
too nothing but your insuperable love of ease? 
Franklin. That I confess may have happened 
oceasionally, probably ten times in a year. 
Gout. Your confession is very far short of the 
truth; the gross amount is one hundred and 
ninety-nine times. 
Franklin. Is it possible? 
Gout. So possible that it is fact; you may rely 
on the accuracy of my statement. You know Mr. 
Brillon’s gardens, and what fine walks they con- 
tain; you know the handsome flight of a hun- 
dred steps, which lead from the terrace above 
to the lawn below. You have been in the practise 
of visiting this amiable family twice a week, after 
dinner, and it is a maxim of your own, that ‘‘a 
man may take as much exercise in walking a 
3
-P-A-G-E-87
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  mile up- and down-stairs as in ten on level 
ground.’? What an opportunity was here for 
you to have had exercise in both these ways! 
Did you embrace it, and how often? 
Franklin. I can not immediately answer that 
question. 
Gout. I will do it for you; not once. 
Franklin. Not once? 
Gout. Even so. During the summer you went 
there at six o’clock. You found the charming 
lady, with her lovely children and friends, eager 
to walk with you, and entertain you with their 
agreeable conversation; and what has been your 
choice? Why, to sit on the terrace, satisfying 
yourself with the fine prospect, and passing your 
eye over the beauties of the garden below, with- 
out taking one step to descend and walk about 
in them. 
On the contrary, dear sir, you call for tea and 
the chess-board; and lo! you are occupied in 
your seat till nine o’clock, and that besides two 
hours’ play after dinner; and then, instead of 
walking home, which would have bestirred you a 
little, you step into your carriage. How absurd 
to suppose that all this carelessness can be recon- 
cilable with health, without my interposition! 
Franklin. I am convinced now of the justness 
of Poor Richard’s remark that ‘‘Our debts and 
our sins are always greater than we think for.’’ 
Gout. So it is. You philosophers are sages in 
your maxims, and fools in your conduct. 
Franklin, But do you charge, among my crimes, 
that I return in a carriage from Mr. Brillon’s? 
Gout. Certainly; for having been seated all the 
while, you can not object the fatigue of the day, 
vea
-P-A-G-E-88
  BENJAMIN FRANKLIN 
  
and can not want, therefore, the relief of a 
earriage. 
Franklin. What, then, would you have me do 
with my carriage? 
Gout. Burn it, if you choose; you would at least 
get heat out of it once in this way, or, if you 
dislike that proposal, here’s another for you; 
observe the poor peasants, who work in the vine- 
yards and grounds about the villages of Passy, 
Auteuil, Chaillot, ete.; you may: find every day, 
among these deserving creatures, four or five old 
men and women, bent and perhaps crippled by 
weight of years and too long and too great labor. 
After a most fatiguing day, these people have 
to trudge a mile or two to their smoky huts. 
Order your coachman to set them down. This 
is an act that will be good for your soul; and, 
at the same time, after your visit to the Brillons, 
if you return on foot, that will be good for your 
ody. 
Franklin. Ah! how tiresome you are! 
Gout. Well, then, to my office; it should not 
be forgotten that I am your physician. There. 
Franklin, Obhh! what a devil of a physician! 
Gout. How ungrateful you are to say so! Is 
it not I who, in the character of your physician, 
have saved you from the palsy, dropsy and apo- 
plexy? one or other of which would have done 
for you long ago but for me. 
Franklin, I submit, and thank you for the past, 
but entreat the discontinuance of your visits for 
the future; for, in my mind, one had better die 
than be cured so dolefully. Permit me just to 
hint that I have also not been unfriendly to you. 
I never feed physician or quack of any kind, to

  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  enter the list against you; if, then, you do not 
leave me to my repose, it may be said you are 
ungrateful too. 
Gout. I ean scarcely acknowledge that as any 
objection. As to quacks, I despise them; they 
may kill you, indeed, but can not injure me. And 
as to regular physicians, they are at last con- 
vinced that the gout, in such a subject as you are, 
is no disease, but a remedy; and wherefore cure 
a remedy?—but to our business—there. 
Franklin. Oh! Oh!—for Heaven’s sake leave 
me; and I promise faithfully never more to play 
at chess, but to take exercise daily, and live tem- 
perately. 
* Gout. I know you too well. You promise fair; 
after a few months of good health you will return 
to your old habits; your fine promises will be 
forgotten like the forms of the last year’s clouds. 
Let us then finish the account, and I will go. But 
lJeave you with an assurance of visiting you again 
at a proper time and place; for my object is 
your good, and you are sensible now that I am 
your real friend.

life as a compliment due to the memory of your

  husband, I retired to my chamber. Throwing 
myself upon my bed I dreamt that I was dead, 
and was transported to the Elysian fields. 
I was asked whether I wished to see any per- 
sons in particular; to which I replied that I 
wished to see the philosophers. ‘‘There are two 
who live here at hand in this garden; they are 
good neighbors and very friendly toward one 
another.’? ‘‘Who are they?’’ ‘‘Soerates and 
Helvetius.’’ <‘‘I esteem them both highly; but 
let me see Helvetius first, because I understand 
a little French but not a word of Greek.’’ I 
was conducted to him; he received me with much 
courtesy, having known me, he said, by character 
some time past. He asked me a thousand ques- 
tions relative to the war, the present state of 
religion, of liberty, of the government in France. 
‘*You do not inquire, then,’’ said I, ‘‘after your 
dear friend, Madame Helvetius; yet she loves you 
exceedingly. I was in her company not more 
than an hour ago.’’ ‘‘Ah,’’ said he, ‘‘you make 
me recur to my past happiness, which ought to 
be forgotten in order to be happy here. For 
many years I could think of nothing but her, tho’ 
at length I am consoled. I have taken another 
wife, the most like her that I could find; she is 
not, indeed, altogether so handsome, but she has 
a great fund of wit and good sense, and her 
whole study is to please me. She is at this mo- 
ment gone to fetch the nectar and ambrosia to 
regale me } stay here awhile and you will see 
her.’’ ‘‘T' perceive,’’ said I, ‘‘that your former 
friend is more faithful to you than you are to 
her; she has had several good offers, but has 
refused ‘them all. I will confess to you that I 
17
-P-A-G-E-91
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  love her extremely, but she was cruel to me and 
rejected me peremptorily for your sake.’’ ‘‘T 
pity you sineerely,’’ said he, ‘‘for she is an ex- 
cellent woman, handsome and amiable. But do 
not the Abbe de la R— and the Abbe M— visit 
her?’’? ‘‘Certainly they do; not one of your 
friends has dropt her acquaintance.’’ ‘‘If you 
had gained the Abbe M— with a bribe of good 
coffee and eream perhaps you would have sue- 
ceeded; for he is as deep a reasoner as Dun 
Scotus or St. Thomas; he arranges and meth- 
odizes his arguments in such a manner that they 
are almost irresistible. Or if by a fine edition 
of some old classic you had gained the Abbe de 
la R— to speak against you, that would have 
been still better, as I always observed that when 
he recommended anything to her, she had a great, 
inclination to do exactly the contrary.’’ 
As he finished these words the new Madame 
Helvetius entered with the nectar and I recog- 
nized her immediately as my former American 
friend, Mrs. Franklin! I reclaimed her, but she 
answered me coldly, ‘‘I was a good wife to you 
for forty-nine years and four months, nearly haif 
a century; let that content you. I have formed 
a new condition here, which will last to eternity.’? 
Indignant at this refusal of my Eurydice, I 
immediately resolved to quit those ungraceful 
shades and return to this good world again, to 
behold the sun and you. Here am I, let us 
avenge ourselves.

THE ARMY* 
My prarzst: I am now set down to write to 
you on a subject which fills me with inexpressible 
eoncern, and this concern is greatly aggravated 
and increased when I reflect upon the uneasiness 
I know it will give you. It has been determined 
in Congress that the whole army raised for the 
defense of the American cause shall be put under 
my ¢are, and that it is necessary for me to pro- 
ceed immediately to Boston to take upon me the 
eommand of it. 
You may believe me, my dear Patsy, when T 
assure you, in the most solemn manner, that, so 
far from seeking this appointment, I have used 
2A letter written in Philadelphia on June 18, 1775, three

  every endeavor in my power to avoid it, ‘not only 
, from my unwillingness to part with you and the 
family, but from a consciousness of its being 
a trust too great for my capacity, and that I 
should enjoy more real happiness in one month 
with you at home than I have the most distant 
prospect of finding abroad, if my stay were to 
be seven times seven years. But as it has been 
a kind of destiny that has thrown me upon this 
service, I shall hope that my undertaking it is 
designed to answer some good purpose. 
You might, and I suppose did perceive, from 
the tenor of my letters, that I was apprehensive 
I could not avoid this appointment, as I did not 
pretend to intimate when I should return. That 
was the ease. It was utterly out of my power 
to refuse this appointment without exposing my 
character to such censures as would have reflected 
dishonor upon myself, and given pain to my, 
friends. This, I am sure, could not, and ought 
not, to be pleasing to you, and must have lessened 
me considerably in my own esteem. I shall rely, 
therefore, confidently on that Providence which 
has heretofore preserved and been bountiful to ~ 
me, not doubting but that I shall return safe 
to you in the fall. I shall feel no pain from the 
toil or the danger of the campaign; my unhappi- 
ness will flow from the uneasiness I know you 
will feel from being left alone. I therefore beg 
that you will summon your whole fortitude, and 
pass your time as agreeably as possible. Nothing 
will give me so much sincere satisfaction as to 
hear this, and to hear it from your own pen. My 
earnest and ardent desire is that you would pur- 
sue any plan that is most likely to produce con-

  tent, and a tolerable degree of tranquillity; as it 
must add greatly to my uneasy feelings to hear 
that you are dissatisfied or complaining at what 
I really could not avoid. 
As life is always uncertain, and common pru- 
dence dictates to every man the necessity of 
settling his temporal concerns, while it is in his 
power, and while the mind is calm and undis- 
turbed, I have, since I came to this place (for 
I had not time to do it before I left home) got 
Colonel Pendleton to draft a will for me, by the 
directions I gave him, which will I now enclose. 
The provision made for you in case of my death 
will, I hope, be agreeable. 
I shall add nothing more, as I have several 
letters to write, but to desire that you will re- 
member me to your friends, and to assure you 
that I am with the most unfeigned regard, my 
dear Patsy, your affectionate, ete.

  that the man who wished to steer clear of shelves 
and rocks must know where they lie. I know the 
integrity of my own heart, but to declare it, unless 
to a friend, may be an argument of vanity; I 
know the unhappy predicament I stand in: I 
know that much is expected of me; I know that 
without men, without arms, without ammunition, 
without anything fit for the accommodation of a 
soldier, little is to be done; and, what is morti- 
fying, I know that I can not stand justified to 
the world without exposing my own weakness, 
and injuring the cause by declaring my wants, 
which I am determined not to do, further than 
unavoidable necessity brings every man ac- 
quainted with them. 
If, under these disadvantages, I am able to 
keep above water, in the esteem of mankind, I 
shall feel myself happy; but if, from the un- 
known peculiarity of my circumstances, I suffer 
in the opinion of the world, I shall not think you

reflections that may be cast upon my conduct. 
My own situation is so irksome to me at times 
that, if I did not consult the publie good more 
than my own tranquillity, I should long ere this 
have put everything on the cast of a die. So 
far from my having an army of twenty thousand 
men well armed, I have been here with less than 
one-half of that number, including sick, fur- 
loughed, and on command, and those neither 
armed nor clothed, as they should be. In short, my 
situation has been such, that J have been obliged 
to use art to conceal it from my own officers.

courts have been held on the conduct of part of 
them. To be plain, these people are not to be 
depended upon if exposed; and any man will 
fight well if he thinks himself in no danger. I 
do not apply this only to these people. I suppose 
it to be the case with all raw and undisciplined 
troops. You may rely upon it that transports 
left Boston six weeks ago with troops; where 
they are gone, unless driven to the West Indies, 
I know not. You may also rely upon General 
Clinton’s sailing from Boston about three weeks 
ago, with about four or five hundred men; his 
destination I am also a stranger to. I am sorry 
to hear of the failures you speak of from France. 
But why will not Congress forward part of the 
powder made in your province? They seem to 
look upon this as the season for action, but will 
not furnish the means. I will not blame them. 
I dare say the demands upon them are greater 
than they ean supply. The cause must be starved 
till our resources are greater, or more certain 
within ourselves. 
With respect to myself, I have never enters 
tained an idea of an accommodation since’ I 
heard of the measures which were adopted in 
consequence of the Bunker Hill fight. The 
King’s speech has confirmed the sentiments I 
entertained upon the news of that affair; and, 
if every man was of my mind, the ministers of 
Great Britain should know, in a few words, upon 
what issue the cause should be put. I would 
not be deceived by artful declarations, nor spe- 
cious pretenses; nor would I be amused by un- 
meaning propositions; but in open, undisguised, 
and manly terms proclaim our wrongs, and our

that we had borne much, that we had long and 
ardently sought for reconciliation upon honorable 
terms, that it had been denied us, that all our 
attempts after peace had proved abortive, and 
had been grossly misrepresented, that we had 
done everything whieh could be expected from 
the best of subjects, that the spirit of freedom 
rises too high in us to submit to slavery, and 
that, if nothing else would satisfy a tyrant and 
his diabolical ministry, we are determined to 
shake off all connections with a state so unjust 
and unnatural. This I would tell them, not under 
covert, but in words as clear as the sun in its

TO THE MARQUIS DE CHASTELLUX ON 
HIS MARRIAGE* 
My pear Marquis: In reading your very 
friendly and- acceptable letter, which came to 
hand by the last mail, I was, as you may well 
suppose, not less delighted than surprized to 
meet the plain American words, ‘‘my wife.’? A

frain from smiling to find you are caught at 
last. I saw by the eulogium you often made on 
the happiness of domestic life in America, that

  you had swallowed the bait, and that you would 
as surely be taken, one day or another, as that 
you were a philosopher and a soldier. 
So your day has at length come. I am glad 
of it, with all my heart and soul. It is quite 
gocd enough for you. Now you are well served 
for coming to fight in favor of the American 
rebels, all the way across the Atlantic Ocean, 
by catching that terrible ‘contagion, domestic 
felicity, which, like the smallpox or the plague, 
a man can have only once in his life, beeause it 
commonly lasts him (at least with us in America; 
I know not how you manage these matters in 
France), for his whole lifetime. And yet, after 
all, the worst wish which I can find in my heart to 
make against Madame de Chastellux and your- 
self is that you may neither of you ever get the 
better of this same domestic felicity, during the 
entire course of your mortal existence. 
If so wonderful an event should have ocea- 
sioned me, my dear Marquis, to write in a strange 
style, you will understand me as clearly as if 
I had said, what in plain English is the simple 
truth, ‘‘Do me the justice to believe that I take 
a heartfelt interest in whatsoever concerns your 
happiness.’’ And, in this view, I sincerely con- 
gratulate you on your auspicious matrimonial 
connection. I am happy to find that Madame de 
Chastellux is so intimately connected with the 
Duchess of Orleans; as I have always understood 
that this noble lady was an illustrious example of 
eonnubial love, as well as an excellent pattern 
of virtue in general. 
While you have been making love under the 
banner of Hymen, the great personages in the

  north have been making war under the inspira- 
tion, er rather under the infatuation, of Mars. 
Now, for my part, I humbly conceive that you 
have acted much the best and wisest part; for 
certainly it is more consonant to all the prin- 
ciples of reason and religion, natural and re- 
vealed, to replenish the earth with inhabitants 
than to depopulate it by killing those already in 
existence. Besides, it is time for the age of 
knight-errantry and mad heroism to be at an end. 
Your young military men, who want to reap the 
harvest of laurels, do not care, I suppose, how 
many seeds of war are sown; but for the sake 
of humanity it is devoutly to be wished, that 
the manly employnient of agriculture, and the 
humanizing benefits of commerce, would super- 
sede the waste of war and the rage of conquest; 
that the swords might be turned into plowshares, 
the spears into pruning-hooks, and, as the Serip- 
tures express it, the ‘‘nations learn war no 
more.’’ 
Now I will give you a little news from this 
side of the water, and then finish. As for us, 
we are plodding on in the dull road of peace 
and polities. We, who live in these ends of the 
earth, only hear of the rumors of war like the 
roar of distant thunder. It is to be hoped that 
our remote local situation will prevent us from 
being swept into its vortex.

ON HIS NOMINATION OF WASHINGTON 
TO BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF?* 
Wuew Congress had assembled, I rose in my 
place, and in as short a speech as the subject 
would admit, represented the state of the col- 
onies, the uncertainty in the minds of the people, 
their great expectation and anxiety, the distresses. 
of the army, the danger of its dissolution, the 
difficulty of collecting another, and the probabili- 
ty that the British army would take advantage

Adams,” as edited by Charles Francis Adams. In his speech 
naming Washington, Adams referred to him as ‘one who 
could unite the cordial exertions of all the colonies better 
than any other person.” Two days later he wrote to his 
wife that Congress had chosen “the modest and virtuous, 
the amiable, generous and brave George Washington, Esq., 
to be chief of the American army.”

  of our delays, march out of Boston, and spread 
desolation as far as they could go. I coneluded 
with a motion, in form, that Congress would 
adopt the army at Cambridge, and appoint a 
general; that tho this was not the proper time to 
nominate a general, yet, as I had reason to believe, 
this was a point of the greatest difficulty. I had no 
hesitation to declare that I had but one gentleman 
in my mind for that important command, and that 
was a gentleman from Virginia who was among us 
and very well known to all of us, a gentleman 
whose skill and experience as an officer, whose 
independent fortune, great talents, and excellent 
universal character, would command the approba- 
tion of all America, and unite the cordial exer- 
tions of all the colonies better than any other 
person in the Union. Mr. Washington, who hap- 
pened to sit near the door, as soon as he heard 
me allude to him, from his usual modesty, darted 
into the library-room. Mr. Hancock—who was 
our President, which gave me an opportunity to 
observe his countenance while I was speaking 
on the state of the colonies, the army at Cam- 
bridge, and the enemy—heard me with visible 
pleasure; but when I came to describe Washing- 
ton for the commander, I never remarked a more 
sudden and striking change of countenance. Mor- 
tification and resentment were exprest as forcibly 
as his face could exhibit them. Mr, Samuel 
Adams seconded the motion, and that did not 
soften the President’s physiognomy at all. 
The subject came under debate, and several 
gentlemen declared themselves against the ap- 
pointment of Mr. Washington, not on account 
of any personal objection against him, but be-

cause the army were all from New England, had 
a general of their own, appeared to be satisfied 
with him, and had proved themselves able to 
imprison the British army in Boston, which was 
all they expected or desired at that time. Mr. 
Pendleton, of Virginia, Mr. Sherman, of Con- 
necticut, were very explicit in declaring this opin- 
ion; Mr. Cushing and several others more faintly 
exprest their opposition, and their fears of dis- 
contents in the army and in New England. Mr. 
Paine exprest a great opinion of General Ward 
and a strong friendship for him, having been his 
classmate at college, or at least his contemporary ; 
but gave no opinion upon the question. The sub- 
ject was postponed to a future day. In the 
mean time, pains were ‘taken out-of-doors to 
obtain a unanimity, and the voices were gen- 
erally so clearly in favor of Washington, that the 
dissentient members were persuaded to withdraw 
their opposition, and Mr. Washington was nom- 
inated, I believe by Mr. Thomas: Johnson of 
Maryland, unanimously elected, and the army 
adopted.

AN ESTIMATE OF FRANKLIN* 
His reputation was more universal than that 
of Leibnitz or Newton, Frederick or Voltaire, 
and his character more beloved and esteemed 
than any or all of them. Newton had astonished 
perhaps forty or fifty men in Europe, for not 
more than that number probably at any one time 
had read him and understood him, by his dis- 
coveries and demonstrations. And these being 
held in admiration in their respective countries, 
as at the head of the philosophers, had spread 
among scientific people a mysterious wonder at 
the genius of this, perhaps, the greatest man 
that ever lived. But this fame was confined to 
men of letters. The common people knew little 
and eared nothing about such a recluse philos- 
opher. Leibnitz’s name was more confined still. 
Frederick was hated by more than half of En- 
rope as much as Louis XIV was and Napoleon 
is. Voltaire, whose name was more universal 
than any of these before mentioned, was con-

The differences of Adams and Franklin form a striking 
incident ia the biographies of the two men. Colaborers 
as they were in & common cause, they had constant dis- 
agreements as to methods while serving their country in 
Europe. That they never openly quarreled Adams’s biog- 
rapher, John T. Morse, attributes to “their sense of propriety 
and dignity, and to the age and position of Dr. Franklin.” 
The radical cause lay in the fact that “they were utterly 
incompatible, both mentally and morally.”

  sidered as a vain, profligate wit, and not much 
esteemed or beloved by anybody, tho admired 
by all who knew his works. But Franklin’s fame 
was universal. His name was familiar to gov- 
ernments and people, to kings, courtiers, nobility, 
clergy and philosophers, as well as plebeians, to 
such a degree that there was scarcely a peasant 
or citizen, a valet de chambre, coachman, or foot- 
man, a lady’s maid, or a scullion in a kitchen, 
who was not familiar with it, and who did not 
consider him a friend to human kind. When 
they spoke of him they seemed to think he was 
to restore the Golden Age. . . . 
Nothing perhaps that ever occurred upon this 
earth was so well caleulated to give any man 
an extensive and universal celebrity as the dis- 
covery of the efficacy of iron points and the in- 
vention of lightning-rods. The idea was one of 
the most sublime that ever entered a human 
imagination that a mortal should disarm the 
elouds of heaven and almost ‘‘snatch from his 
hand the scepter and the rod.’’ The ancients 
would have enrolled him with Bacchus and Ceres, 
Hereules and Minerva. . . 
Franklin had a great genius, original, saga- 
cious, and inventive, capable of discoveries in 
science no Jess than of improvements in the fine 
arts and the mechanic arts. He had a vast 
imagination, equal to the comprehension of the 
greatest objects, and capable of a steady aad 
cool comprehension of them. He had wit at will. 
He had humor that, when he pleased, was delicate 
and delightful. He had a satire that was good- 
natured or caustic, Horace or Juvenal, Swift 
or Rabelais, at his pleasure. He had talents for 
91
-P-A-G-E-105
  
THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  irony, allegory, and fable, that he could adapt 
with great skill to the promotion of moral and 
political truth. He was master of that infantine 
simplicity which the French call naiveté, which 
never fails to charm, in Phedrus and La Fon- 
taine, from the eradle to the grave. 
Had he been blest with the same advantages 
of scholastic education in his early youth, and 
pursued a course of studies as unembarrassed 
with oceupations of public and private life, as 
Sir Isaac Newton, he might have emulated the 
first philosopher. Altho IT am not ignorant that 
most of his positions and hypotheses have been 
controverted, I can not. but think he has added 
much to the mass of natural knowledge, and con- 
tributed largely to the progress of the human 
mind, both by his own writings and by the con- 
troversies and experiments he has excited in all 
parts of Europe. He had abilities for inves- 
tigating statistical questions, and in some parts 
of his life has written pamphlets and essays upon 
public topies with great ingenuity and success; 
but after my acquaintance with him, which com- 
menced in Congress in 1775, his excellence as 
a legislator, a politician, or a negotiator most 
certainly never appeared. No sentiments more 
weak and superficial were ever avowed by the 
most absurd philosopher than some of his, par- 
ticularly one that he procured to be inserted in 
the first constitution of Pennsylvania, and for 
which he had such a fondness ag to insert it 
in his will. I call it weak, for so it must have 
been, or hypocritical; unless he meant by one 
satirie touch to ridieule his own republie, or 
throw it into everlasting contempt.

I must acknowledge, after all, that nothing 
in life has mortified or grieved me more than the 
necessity which compelled me to oppose him so 
often as I have. He was a man with whom I 
always wished to live in friendship, and for that 
purpose omitted no demonstration of respect, es- 
teem, and veneration in my power, until I had 
unequivocal proofs of his hatred, for no other 
reason under the sun, but because I gave my 
judgment in opposition to his, in many points 
which materially affected the interests of our 
country, and in many more which essentially con- 
cerned our happiness, safety, and well-being. I 
could not and would not sacrifice the clearest 
dictates of my understanding and the purest 
principles of morals and policy in compliance to

Tue blood of the slain, the weeping voice of

distance at which the Almighty hath placed Eng- 
land and America, is a strong and natural proof 
that the authority of the one over the other was - 
never the design of heaven. The time, likewise, 
at which the continent was discovered, adds 
weight to the argument, and the manner in which 
it was peopled, increases the force of it. The 
Reformation was preceded by the discovery of 
2¥rom “Common Sense,” a pamphlet issued by Paine 
in Philadelphia on January 1, 1776. In this work Paime 
advocated complete separation from England. His argu: 
ments helped to consolidate and make effective a sentiment

many men.”

  America, as if the Almighty graciously meant 
to open a sanctuary to the persecuted in future 
years, when home should afford neither friend- 
ship nor safety. 
The authority of Great Britain over this con- 
tinent is a form of government which sooner or 
later must have an end: and a serious mind can 
draw no true pleasure by looking forward, under 
the painful and positive conviction that what he 
ealls ‘‘the present constitution’’ is merely tem- 
porary. As parents, we can have no joy knowing 
that this government is not sufficiently lasting 
to insure anything which we may bequeath to 
posterity; and by a plain method of argument, 
as we are running the next generation into debt, 
we ought to do the work of it, otherwise we use 
them meanly and pitifully. In order to discover 
the line of our duty rightly, we should take our’ 
children in our hand, and fix our station a few 
years farther into life; that eminence will pre- 
sent a prospect which a few present fears and 
prejudices conceal from our sight. 
Tho I would carefully avoid giving unnecessary 
offense, yet I am inclined to believe that all 
those who espouse the doctrine of reconciliation 
may be included within the following deserip- 
tions: 
Interested men, who are not to be trusted; 
weak men, who can not see; prejudiced men, 
who will not see; and a certain set of moderate 
men, who think better of the European world 
than it deserves: and this last class, by an ill- 
judged deliberation, will be the cause of more 
calamities to this continent than all the other 
three.

  It is the good fortune of many to live distant 
from the scene of sorrow; the evil is not suffi- 
ciently brought to their doors to make them feel 
the precariousness with which all American prop- 
erty is possest. But let our imaginations trans- 
port us a few moments to Boston; that seat of 
wretchedness will teach us wisdom, and instruct 
us forever to renounce a power in whom we ean 
have no trust. The inhabitants of that unfor- 
tunate city, who but a few months ago were in 
ease and affluence, have now no other alternative 
than to stay and starve, or turn out to beg. En- 
dangered by the fire of their friends if they

soldiery if they leave it. In their present situ- 
ation they are (prisoners without the hope of 
redemption, and in a general attack for their relief 
they would be exposed to the fury of both armies. 
Men of passive tempers look somewhat lightly 
over the offenses of Britain, and, still hoping for 
‘the best, are apt to call out, “Come, come, we 
shall be ‘friends again for all this.’? But examine 
the passions and feelings of mankind, bring the 
doctrine of reconcilation to the touchstone of 
nature, and then tell me whether you can here- 
after love, honor, and faithfully serve the power 
that hath carried fire and sword into your land? 
If you ean not do all these, then are you only 
deceiving yourselves, and by your delay bringing 
ruin upon your posterity. Your future connec- 
tion with Britain, whom you can neither love 
nor honor, will be forced and unnatural, and 
being formed only on the plan of present con-

more wretched than the first. But if you say

  you can still pass the violations over, then I 
ask, hath your house been burnt? Hath your 
property been destroyed before your face? Are 
your wife and children destitute of a bed to lie 
on, or bread to live on? Have you lost a parent 
or a child by their hands, and yourself the ruined 
and wretched survivor? If you have not, then 
are you not a judge of those who have. But if 
you have, and can still shake hands with the 
murderers, then are you unworthy the name of 
husband, father, friend, or lover, and, whatever 
may be your rank or title in life, you have the 
heart of a coward and the spirit of a syeophant.

In the meantime these troops, to the number 
of twenty to thirty thousand, had arrived and 
were posted in and between Paris and Ver- 
sailles. The bridges and passes were guarded. 
The King was now completely in the hands of 
men the principal among whom had been noted, 
through their lives, for the Turkish despotism 
of their characters, and who were associated 
around the King as proper instruments for what 
was to be executed. The news of this change 
began to be known at Paris about one or two 
o’clock. In the afternoon a body of about one 
hundred German cavalry were advanced, and 
drawn up in the Place Louis XV, and about two 
hundred Swiss posted ai a little distance in their 
rear. This drew people to the spot, who thus

accidentally found themselves in front of the 
troops, merely at first as spectators; but, as their 
numbers inereased, their indignation rose. They 
retired a few steps, and posted themselves on 
and behind large piles of stones, large and small, 
collected in that place for a bridge, which was 
to be built adjacent to it. 
In this position, happening to be in my ear- 
riage on a visit, I passed through the lane they 
had formed without interruption. But the mo- 
ment after I had passed, the people attacked the . 
cavalry with stones. They charged, bntsthe af- 
vantageous position of the people, and the show- 
ers of stones, obliged the horse to ‘retire, and 
quit the field altogether, leaving ont, of their 
number on the ground, and the Swiss in’the rear 
not moving to their aid. This was the/signal 
for universal insurreetion, and’this body of ‘cay- 
alry, to avoid being massacréd, retired towotd 
Versailles. The people now’ armed themselvés” , 
with such weapons as they could find in armorers’ “ 
shops, and private houses, and with bludgeons; 
and were roaming all night, through yy parts 
of the city, without any decided object. §  ' 
The next day (the 13th) the Assembly prest 
on the King to send away the troops, to permit 
the bourgeoisie of Paris to arm for the preserva- 
tion of order in the city, and offered to send a 
deputation from their body to tranquillize them; 
but their propositions were refused. A committee 
of magistrates and electors of the city were 
appointed by those bodies, to take upon them 
its government. The people, now openly joined 
by the French guards, forced the prison of St. 
Lazare, released all the prisoners, and took a

great store of corn, which they carried to the 
eorn-market. Here they got some arms, and the 
French guards began to form and train them. 
The city committee determined to raise forty- 
eight thousand bourgeoisie, or rather to restrain 
their numbers to forty-eight thousand. 
On the 14th, they sent one of their members 
(Monsieur de Corny) to the Hotel des Invalides, 
to ask arms for their Garde Bourgeoisie. He 
was followed by, and he found there, a great 
eollection of people. The Governor of the Tn- 
Yalids came out, and represented the impossibility 
” of his delivering arms without the orders of those 
from whom he received them. De Corny advised 
the people then to retire, and retired himself; 
but the people took possession of the arms. It 
was remarkable that not only the Invalids them- 
selves made no opposition, but that a body of 
five thousand foreign troops, within four hundred. 
yards, never stirred. M. De Corny, and five 
others, were then sent to ask arms of M. de 
Launay, Governor of the Bastile. They found 
‘a great collection of people already before the 
plave, and they immediately planted a flag of 
truce, which was answered by a like flag hoisted 
on the parapet. The deputation prevailed on the 
people to fall back a little, advanced themselves 
to make their demand of the Governor, and in 
that instant a discharge from the Bastile killed 
four persons of those nearest to the deputies. 
The deputies retired. I happened to be at the 
house of M. de Corny, when he returned to it, 
and received from him a narrative of these trans- 
actions. 
On the retirement of the deputies the people

in possession of a fortification of infinite strength, 
defended by one hundred men, which in other times 
had stood several regular sieges, and had never 
been taken. How they forced their entrance has 
never been explained. They took all the arms, 
discharged the prisoners, and such of the gar- 
rison as were not killed in the first moment of 
fury; earried the Governor and Lieutenant-Gov- 
ernor to the Place de Gréve (the place of public 
execution), eut off their heads, and sent them 
through the city, in triumph, to the Palais royal. 
About the same instant a Freacherous correspond- 
ence having been discovered in M. de Filesseles, 
Prevét des Marchands, they seized him in the 
Hotel de Ville, where he was in the execution 
of his office, and cut off his head. 
These events, carried imperfectly to Versailles, 
were the subject of two successive deputations 
from the Assembly to the King, to both of which 
he gave dry and hard answers; for nobody had 
as yet been permitted to inform him, truly and 
fully, of what had passed at Paris. But at night 
the Duke de Lianeourt forced his way into the 
King’s bedchamber, and obliged him to hear a 
full and animated detail of the disasters of the 
day in Paris. He went to bed fearfully imprest. 
The decapitation of de Launay worked power- 
fully through the night on the whole Aristocratie 
party; insomuch that in the morning those of the 
greatest influence on the Count d’Artois repre- 
sented to him the absolute necessity that the 
King should give up everything to the Assembly. 
This according with the dispositions of the King, 
he went about eleven o’clock, accompanied only 
101

  by his brothers, to the Assembly, and there read 
to them a speech, in which he asked their inter- 
position to reestablish order. Altho couched in 
terms of some caution, yet the manner in which 
it was delivered made it evident that it was 
meant as a surrender at discretion. He returned 
to the Chateau afoot, accompanied by the As- 
sembly. 
They sent off a deputation to quiet Paris, at 
the head of which was the Marquis de La Fayette, 
who had, the same morning, been named Com- 
mandant en chef of the Milice Bourgeoise; and 
Monsieur Bailly, former President of the States 
General, was called for as Prevét des Marchands. 
The demolition of the Bastile was now ordered 
and begun. A body of the Swiss guards, of the 
regiment of Ventimille, and the city horse guards 
joined the people. The alarm at Versailles in- 
creased. The foreign troops were ordered off 
instantly. Every minister resigned. The King 
confirmed Bailly as Prevét des Marchands, wrote 
to M. Necker, to recall him, sent his letter open 
to the Assembly, to be forwarded by them, and 
invited them to go with him to Paris the next 
day, to satisfy the city of his dispositions; and 
that night, and the next morning, the Count d’Ar- 
tois, and M. de Montesson, a deputy connected 
with him, Madame de Polignac, Madame de 
Guiche, and the Count de Vaudreuil, favorites of 
the Queen, the Abbe de Vermont, her confessor, 
the Prince of Conde, and the Duke of Bourbon 
led. 
The King eame to Paris, leaving the Queen 
in consternation for his return. Omitting the 
less important figures of the procession, the

  King’s carriage was in the center; on each side 
of it the Assembly, in two ranks afoot; at their 
head the Marquis de La Fayette, as Commander- 
in-chief, on horseback, and Bourgeois guards be- 
fore and behind. About sixty thousand citizens, 
of all forms and conditions, armed with the con- 
quests of the Bastile and Invalids, as far as 
they would go, the rest with pistols, swords, 
pikes, pruning-hooks, seythes, ete., lined all the 
streets through which the procession passed, and 
with the crowds of people in the streets, doors, 
and windows, saluted them everywhere with the 
cries of ‘‘vive la nation,’’ but not a single ‘‘vive 
le roi’? was heard. The King stopt at the Hotel 
de Ville. There M. Bailly presented, and put 
into his hat the popular cockade, and addrest 
him. The King being unprepared, and unable to 
answer, Bailly went to him, gathered from him 
some scraps of sentences, and made out an an- 
swer, which he delivered to the audience as from 
the King. On their return, the popular cries 
were ‘‘vive le Roi et la nation.’? He was con- 
ducted by a Garde Bourgeoise to his palace at 
Versailles, and thus coneluded an ‘‘amende hono- 
rable,’’ as no sovereign ever made, and no people 
ever received. 
And. here, again, was lost another precious 
occasion of sparing to France the crimes and 
cruelties through which she has since passed, and 
to Europe, and finally America, the evils which 
flowed on them also from this mortal source. The 
King was now become a passive machine in the 
hands of the National Assembly, and had he been 
left to himself, he would have willingly acqui- 
esced in whatever they should devise as best 
103

  for the nation. A wise constitution would have 
been formed, hereditary in his line, himself placed 
at its head, with powers so large as to enable 
him to do all the good of his station, and so 
limited as to restrain him from its abuse. - This 
he would have faithfully administered, and more 
than this I do not believe he ever wished. But 
he had a Queen of absolute sway over his weak 
mind and timid virtue, and of a character the 
reverse of his in all points. This angel, as gaudi- 
ly painted in the rhapsodies of! Burke,’ with some 
smartness of fancy, but no sound sense, was 
proud, disdainful of restraint, indignant at all 
obstacles to her will, eager in the pursuit of 
pleasure, and firm enough to hold to her desires, 
or perish in their wreck. Her inordinate gam- 
bling and dissipations, with those of the Count 
d’Artois, and others of her clique, had been a 
sensible item in the exhaustion of the treasury, 
which called into action the reforming hand of 
the nation; and her opposition to it, her inflexible 
perverseness, and dauntless spirit, led herself to 
the guillotine, drew the King on with her, and 
plunged the world into erimes and calamities 
which will forever stain the pages of modern 
history. 
I have ever believed that had there been no 
Queen there would have been no revolution. No 
foree would have been provoked, nor exercised. 
The King would have gone hand in hand with 
the wisdom of his sounder counselors, who, guided 
by the increased lights of the age, wished only, 
with the same pace, to advance the principles

  of their social constitution. The deed which 
elosed the mortal course of these sovereigns I 
shall neither approve nor condemn. I am not 
-perpared to say that the first magistrate of a 
nation can not commit treason against his coun- 
try, or is unamenable to its punishment; nor yet 
that where there is no written Jaw, no regulated 
tribunal, there is not a law in our hearts, and 
a power in our hands, given for righteous em- 
ployment in maintaining right and_ redressing 
wrong. Of those who judged the King many 
thought him wilfully criminal; many, that his 
existence would keep the nation in perpetual. 
conflict with the horde of kings who would war 
against a generation which might come home 
to themselves, and that it were better that one 
should die than all. I should not have voted 
with this portion of the Legislature. I should 
have shut up the Queen in a convent, putting 
harm out of her power, and placed the King in 
his station, investing him with limited powers, 
which, I verily believe, he would have honestly 
exercised, according to the measure of his under- 
standing. In this way no void would have been 
ereated, courting the usurpation of a military 
adventurer, nor oceasion given for those enormi- 
ties which demoralized the nations of the world, 
and destroyed, and are yet to destroy millions 
and millions of its inhabitants.

THE FUTILITY OF DISPUTES* 
I wave mentioned. good humor as one of the 
preservatives of our peace and tranquillity. It 
is among the most effectual, and its effect is.so 
well imitated and aided, artificially, by politeness 
that this also becomes an acquisition of first-rate 
value. In truth, politeness is artificial good hu- 
mor; it covers the natural want of it, and. ends 
by rendering habitual a substitute nearly equiv- 
alent to the real virtue. It is the practise of 
sacrificing to those whom we meet in society all 
the little conveniences and preferences which will 
gratify them, and deprive us of nothing worth 
a moment’s consideration; it is the giving a 
pleasing and flattering turn to our expressions, 
which will conciliate others, and make them 
pleased with us as well as themselves. How 
cheap a price for the good will of another! When 
this is in return for a rude thing said by an- 
other, it brings him to his senses, it mortifies 
and corrects him in the most salutary way, and 
places him at the feet of your good nature in 
the eyes of the company. 
But in stating prudential rules for our govern- 
ment in society I must not omit the important 
one of never entering into dispute or argument 
with another. I never saw an instance of one 
of two disputants convincing the other by argu-

Washington, Nov. 24, 1808.

ment. I have seen many, on their getting warm, 
becoming rude, and shooting one another. Con- 
viction is the effect of our own dispassionate 
reasoning, either in solitude, or weighing within 
ourselves, dispassionately, what we hear from 
others, standing uncommitted in argument our- 
selves. It was one of the rules which, above all ~ 
others, made Doctor Franklin the most amiable 
of men in society ‘‘never to contradict anybody.’’ . 
If he was urged to announce an opinion, he did 
it rather by asking questions, as if for informa- 
tion, or by suggesting doubts. When I hear an- 
other express an opinion which is not mine, I 
say to myself he has a right to his opinion, as 
I to mine; why should I question it? His error 
does me no injury, and shall I become a Don 
Quixote, to bring all men by force of argument 
to one opinion? If a fact be misstated, it is 
probable he is gratified by a belief of it, and I 
have no right to deprive him of the gratification. 
If he wants information, he will ask it, and then 
I will give it in measured terms; but if he still 
believes his own story, and shows a desire to 
dispute the fact with me, I hear him and say 
nothing. It is his affair, not mine, if he prefers 
error. 
There are two classes of disputants most fre- 
quently to be met with among us. The first is 
of young students, just entered the threshold of 
science, with a first view of its outlines, not yet 
filled up with the details and modifications which 
a further progress would bring to their knowl- 
edge. The other consists of the ill-tempered and 
rude men im society, who have taken up a pas- 
sion for polities. (Good humor and politeness

  never introduce into mixt society a question on 
which they foresee there will be a difference of 
opinion.) From both of those classes of dis- 
putants, my dear Jefferson, keep aloof as you 
would from the infected subjects of yellow fever 
or pestilence. Consider yourself, when with 
them, as among the patients of Bedlam, needing 
medical more than moral counsel. Be a listener 
only, keep within yourself, and endeavor to es- 
tablish with yourself the habit of silence, espe- 
cially on politics. In the fevered state of our 
country no good can ever result from any attempt 
to set one of these fiery zealots to rights, either 
in faet or principle. They are determined as to 
the facts they will believe, and the opinions on 
which they will act. Get by them, therefore, as 
you would by an angry bull; it is not for a man 
of sense to dispute the road with such an animal.

corrected and enlarged in the winter of 1782, in answer 
to quéries propesed to the author by a foreigner of dis 
tinction then residing among us,”

  whites; ten thousand recollections, by the blacks, 
of the injuries they have sustained; new prov- 
ocations; the real distinctions which nature has 
made; and many other cireumstances will divide 
us into parties, and produce convulsions which 
will probably never end but in the extermination 
of the one or the other race. To these objections, 
which are political, may be added others, which 
are physical and moral. 
The first difference which strikes us is that of 
color. Whether the black of the negro resides 
in the reticular membrane between the skin and 
the searf-skin, or in the scarf-skin itself; whether 
it proceeds from the color of the blood, the color 
of the bile, or from that of some other seeretion, 
the difference is fixt in nature, and is as real 
as if its seat and cause were better known to 
us. And is this difference of no importance? 
Is it not the foundation of a greater or less share 
of beauty in the two races? Are not the fine 
mixtures of red and white, the expressions of 
every passion by greater or less suffusions of color 
in the one, preferable to that eternal monotony 
which reigns in the countenances, that immovable 
veil of black which covers all the emotions of 
the other race? 
Add to these flowing hair, a more elegant sym- 
metry of form, their own judgment in favor of 
the whites, declared by their preference of them, 
as uniformly as is the preference of the orang- 
utan for the black women over those of his own 
species. The circumstance of superior beauty 
is thought worthy attention in the propagation 
of our horses, dogs, and other domestic animals; 
why not in that of man? Besides those of color, 
109
-P-A-G-E-123
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  figure, and hair, there are other physical distine- 
tions proving a difference of race. They have 
less hair on the. face and body. They secrete 
less by the kidneys, and more by the glands of 
the skin, which gives them a very strong and 
disagreeable odor. This great degree of trans- 
piration renders them more tolerant of heat, and 
less so of cold than the whites. 
Perhaps, too, a difference of structure in the pul- 
monary apparatus, which a late ingenious experi- 
mentalist has discovered to be the principal regula- 
tor of animal heat, may have disabled them from 
extricating, in the act of inspiration, so much 
of that fluid from the outer air, or obliged them 
in expiration to part with more of it. They 
seem to require less sleep. A. black, after hard 
labor through the day, will be induced by the 
slightest amusement to sit up till midnight, or 
later, tho knowing he must be out with the first 
dawn of the morning. They are at least as brave, 
and more adventuresome. 
But this may perhaps proceed from a want 
of forethought, which prevents their seeing a 
danger till it be present. When present, they 
do not go through it with more coolness or steadi- 
ness than the whites. They are more ardent 
after their female; but love seems with them 
to be more an eager desire than a tender, delicate 
mixture of sentiment and sensation. Their griefs 
are transient. Those numberless afflictions, which 
render it doubtful whether heaven has given life 
to us in merey or in wrath, are less felt, and 
sooner forgotten with them. In general, their 
existence appears to participate more of sensa- 
tion than reflection. To this must be aseribed 
110

  their disposition to sleep when abstracted from 
their diversions, and unemployed in labor. An 
animal, whose body is at rest and who does not 
reflect, must be disposed to sleep, of course. Com- 
paring them by their faculties of memory, reason, 
and imagination, it appears to me that in memory 
they are equal to the whites; in reason much 
inferior, as I think one could searcely be found 
capable of tracing and comprehending the in- 
vestigations of Euclid; and that in imagination 
they are dull, tasteless, and anomalous. 
It would be unfair to follow them to Africa 
for this investigation. We will -consider them 
here, on the same stage with the whites, and 
where the facts are not apocryphal on which a 
judgment is to be formed. Ht will be right to 
make great allowances for the difference of con- 
dition, of education, of conversation, of the 
sphere in which they move. Many millions of 
them have been brought to, and born in America. 
Most of them, indeed, have been confined to 
tillage, to their own homes, and their own so- 
ciety; yet many have been so situated that they 
might have availed themselves of the conversa- 
tion of their masters; many have been brought 
up to the handicraft. arts, and from that cireum- 
stance have always been associated with the 
white. Some have been liberally edueated, and 
all have lived in countries where the arts and 
sciences are cultivated to a considerable degree, 
and have had before their eyes samples of the 
best works from abroad. 
The Indians, with no advantages of their kind, 
will often carve figures on their pipes not desti- 
tute of design and merit. They will crayon out 
11
-P-A-G-E-125
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  an animal, a plant, or a country, so as to prove 
the existence of a germ in their minds which only 
wants cultivation. They astonish you with 
strokes of the most sublime oratory; such as 
prove their reason and sentiment strong, their 
imagination glowing and elevated. But never 
yet could I find that a black had uttered a 
thought above the level of plain narration; never 
saw even an elementary trait of painting or 
sculpture. In music they are more generally 
gifted than the whites with accurate ears for 
tune and time, and they have been found capable 
of imagining a small catch, Whether they will 
be equal to the composition of a more extensive 
run of melody, or of complicated harmony is yet 
to be proved. Misery is often the parent of the 
most affecting touches in poetry. Among the 
blacks is misery enough, God knows, but no 
poetry. Love is the peculiar wstrum of the poet. 
Their love is ardent, but it kindles the senses 
only, not the imagination. 
There must doubtless be an unhappy influenee 
on the manners of our people produced by the 
existence of slavery among us. The whole com- 
merce between master and slave is a perpetual 
exercise of the most boisterous passions — the 
most unremitting despotism on the one part and 
degrading submissions on the other. Our chil- 
dren see this, and learn to imitate it; for man 
is an imitative animal. This quality is the germ 
of all education in him. From his eradle to his 
grave he is learning to do what he sees others 
do. If a parent could find no motive either in 
his philanthropy or his self-love for restraining 
the intemperance of passion toward his slave, 
112
-P-A-G-E-126
  THOMAS JEFFERSON 
  it should always be a sufficient one that his child 
is present. 
But generally it is not sufficient. The parent 
storms; the child looks on, catches the lineaments 
of wrath, puts on the same airs, in the circle 
of smaller slaves gives a loose to the worst of 
passions, and thus nursed, educated, and daily 
exercised in tyranny, can not but be stamped 
by it with odious peculiarities. The man must 
be a prodigy who ean retain his manners and 
morals undepraved by such circumstances. And 
with what execrations should the statesman be 
loaded who, permitting one-half the citizens thus 
to trample on the rights of the other, transforms 
those into despots and these into enemies, de- 
stroys the morals of the one part and the amor 
patria of the other! For if a slave can have a 
country in this world, it must be any other in 
preference to that in which he is born to live 
and labor for another; in which he must lock 
up the faculties of his nature, contribute as far 
as depends on his individual endeavors to the 
evanishment of the human race, or entail his 
own miserable condition on the endless genera- 
tions proceeding from him. With the morals of 
the people, their industry is destroyed. For in 
a warm climate no man will labor for himself 
who can make another labor for him. This is 
so true that of the proprietors of slaves a very 
small proportion indeed are ever seen to labor.

HIS ACCOUNT OF LOGAN’S FAMOUS 
SPEECH*® 
Tue principles of their society forbidding all 
compulsion, they are to be led to duty and to 
enterprise by personal influence and persuasion. 
Hence eloquence in council, bravery and success 
in war become the foundations of all consequence 
with them. To these acquirements all their facul- 
ties are directed. Of their bravery and address 
in war we have multiplied proofs, because we 
have been the subjects on which they were ex- 
ercised. Of their eminence in oratory we have 
fewer examples, because it is displayed chiefly 
in their own councils. Some, however, we have 
of very superior luster. I may challenge the 
whole orations of Demosthenes and Cicero, and 
of any more eminent orator, if Europe has fur- 
nished any more eminent, to produce a single 
passage superior to the speech of Logan, a Mingo 
chief, to Lord Dunmore, when governor of this 
State. And, as a testimony of their talents in 
this line, I beg leave to introduce it, first stating 
the incidents necessary for understanding it. 
In the spring of the year 1774 a robbery was 
committed. by some Indians on certain land ad- 
venturers on the river Ohio. The whites in that 
quarter, according to their custom, undertook 
to punish this outrage in a summary way. Cap-

  . house leading on these parties, surprized, at dif- 
ferent times, traveling and hunting parties of 
the Indians, having their women and children 
with them, and murdered many. Among these 
were unfortunately the family of Logan, a chief 
celebrated in peace and war, and long distin- 
guished as the friend of the whites. This un- 
worthy return provoked his vengeance. He ac- 
cordingly signalized himself in the war which 
ensued. In the autumn of the same year a deci- 
sive battle was fought at the mouth of the Great 
Kanawha, between the collected forees of the 
Shawanese, Mingoes and Delawares, and a de- 
tachment of the Virginia militia. The Indians 
were defeated and sued for peace. Logan, how- 
ever, disdained to be seen among the suppliants. 
But lest the sincerity of a treaty should be dis- 
turbed, from which so distinguished a chief ab- 
sented himself, he sent, by a messenger, the 
speech, to be delivered to Lord Dunmore® . . . 
The story of Logan is repeated precisely as 
it had been current for more than a dozen years 
before it was published. When Lord Dun- 
more returned from the expedition against the 
Indians, in 1774, he and his officers brought the 
speech of Logan, and related the circumstances 
connected with it. These were so affecting, and 
the speech itself so fine a morsel of eloquence, 
that it became the theme of every conversation, 
in Williamsburg particularly, and generally, in- 
deed, wheresoever any of the officers resided or

  resorted. I learned it in Williamsburgh; I be- 
lieve at Lord Dunmore’s; and I find in my 
pocket-book of that year (1774) an entry of the 
narrative, as taken from the mouth of some 
person, whose name, however, is not noted, nor 
recollected, precisely in the words stated in the 
‘Notes on Virginia.’? The speech was published 
in the Virginia Gazette of that time (I have it 
myself in the volume of gazettes of that year), 
and tho in a style by no means elegant, yet it 
was so admired that it flew through all the 
publie papers of the continent, and through the 
magazines and other periodical publications of 
Great Britain; and those who were boys at that 
day will now attest that the speech of Logan 
used to be given them as a school exercise for 
repetition. It was not till about thirteen or 
fourteen years after the newspaper publications 
that the ‘‘Notes on Virginia’’ were published in 
America. Combating in these the contumelious 
theory of certain European writers, whose celeb- 
rity have currency and weight to their opinions, 
that our country, from the combined effeets of 
soil and climate, degenerated animal nature, in 
the generai, and particularly the moral faculties 
of man, I considered the speech of Logan as an 
apt proof of the contrary, and used it as such; 
and I eopied, verbatim, the narrative I had taken 
down in 1774 and the speech as it had been 
given us in a better translation by Lord Dun- 
more.”

sentatives of the nobility, drest in a robe of 
black, waisteoats of cloth of gold, and over their 
shoulders, so as to hang forward to their waists, 
a kind of lapels about a quarter of a yard wide 
at top, and wider at bottom, made of cloth of 
gold. On benches, which reached quite across 
_ the hall, and facing the stage, sat the representa- 
tives of the people clothed in black. In the 
space between the clergy and nobles, directly in 
front of the representatives of the people, and 
facing the throne, stood the heralds-at-arms, with 
their staves and in very rich dresses. 
When the King entered, he was saluted with 
a shout of applause. Some time after he had 
taken his seat, he put on a round beaver, or-

  namented with white plumes, the part in front 
turned up, with a large diamond button in the 
center. He read his speech well, and was inter- 
rupted at a part which affected his audience by 
a loud shout of Vive le Roi. After this had sub- 
sided, he finished his speech, and received again 
an animated acclamation of applause. He then 
took off his hat, and after a while put it on 
again, at which the nobles also put on their hats, 
which resembled the King’s, excepting the but- 
ton. The effect of this display of plumage was 
fine. 
The Keeper of the Seals then performed his 
genuflexions to the throne, and mumbled out, in 
a very ungraceful manner, a speech of consider- 
able length, which nobody pretends to judge of, 
because nobody heard it. He was succeeded by 
M. Necker,’ who soon handed his speech to his 
clerk, being unable to go through with it. The 
clerk delivered it much better than the minister, 
and that is no great praise. It was three hours 
long, contained many excellent things, but too 
much of compliment, too much of repetition, and 
indeed too much of everything, for it was too 
long by two hours, and yet fell short in some 
eapital points of great expectation. He received, 
however, very repeated plaudits from the au- 
dience, some of which were merited, but more 
were certainly paid to his character than to his

eomes to a close, and the King rises to depart. 
The hall resounds with a long loud Vive le Rot. 
He passes the Queen, who rises to follow him. 
At this moment some one, imbued with the milk 
of human kindness, originates a faint Vive la 
Reine. She makes a humble courtesy and pre- 
sents the sinking of the high Austrian spirit; 
a livelier acclamation in return, and to this her 
lowlier bending, which is succeeded by a shout 
of loud applause. Here drops the curtain on the 
first great act of this great drama, in which 
Bourbon gives freedom. His courtiers seem to 
feel what he seems to be insensible of, the pang 
of greatness going off.

OF THE EXECUTION OF LOUIS XVI* 
Tue late King of this country has been pub- 
liely executed. He died in a manner becoming 
his dignity. Mounting the scaffold, he exprest 
anew his forgiveness of those who persecuted 
him, and a prayer that his deluded people might 
be benefited by his death. On the scaffold he 
attempted to speak, but the commanding officer, 
Santerre, ordered the drums to beat. The King 
made two unavailing efforts, but with the same 
bad success. The executioners threw him down,

  and were in such haste as to let fall the ax before 
his neck was properly placed, so that he was 
mangled. 
It would be needless to give you an affecting 
narrative of particulars. I proceed to what is 
more important, having but a few minutes to 
write in by the present good opportunity. The 
greatest care was taken to prevent @ concourse 
of people. This proves a conviction that the 
majority was not favorable to that severe measure. 
In fact, the great mass of the people mourned 
the fate of their unhappy prince. I have 
seen grief, such as for the untimely death of 
a beloved parent. Everything wears an appear- 
ance of solemnity which is awfully distressing. 
I have been told by a gentleman from the spot 
that putting the King to death would be a signal 
for disbanding the army in Flanders. I do not 
believe this, but incline to think it will have 
some effect on the army, already perishing by 
want and moldering fast away. The people of 
that country, if the French army retreats, will, 
I am persuaded, take a severe vengeance for the 
injuries they have felt and the insults they have 
been exposed to. Both are great. The war 
against France is become popular in Austria, 
and is becoming so in Germany. If my judg- 
ment be good, the testament of Louis the Six- 
teenth will be more powerful against the present 
rulers of this country than any army of a hun- 
dred thousand men. You will learn the effeet it 
has in England. I believe that the English will 
be wound up to a pitch of enthnsiastie horror 
against France, which their cool and steady tem- 
per seems to be scarcely susceptible of.

  I enclose you a translation of a letter from 
Sweden, which I have received from Denmark. 
You will see thereby that the Jacobin principles 
are propagated with zeal in every quarter. 
Whether the Regent of Sweden intends to make 
himself king is a moot point. All the world 
knows that the young prince is not legitimate, 
altho born under circumstances which render it, 
legally speaking, impossible to question his legit” 
imacy. I consider a war between Britain and 
France is inevitable. I have not proof, but some 
very leading circumstances. Britain will, I think, 
suspend her blow until she can strike very hard, 
unless, indeed, they should think it advisable to 
seize the moment of indignation against late 
events for a declaration of war. This is not 
improbable, because it may be coupled with those 
general declarations against all kings, under the 
name of tyrants, which contain a determination 
to destroy them, and the threat that if the min- 
isters of England presume to declare war, an 
appeal shall be made to the people at the head 
of an invading army. Of course, a design may 
be exhibited of entering into the heart of Great 
Britain, to overrun the Constitution, destroy the 
rights of property, and finally to dethrone and 
murder the King—all which are things the Eng- 
lish will neither approve of nor submit to.

OF THE FAILURE OF CONFEDERATION ~* 
In the course of the preceeding papers, I have 
endeavored, my fellow citizens, to place before 
you, in a clear and convincing light, the impor- 
tance of union to your political safety and hap- 
piness. I have unfolded to you a complication 
of dangers to which you would be exposed, should 
you permit that sacred knot, which binds the 
people of America together, to be severed or dis- 
solved by ambition or by avarice, by jealousy 
or by misrepresentation. In the sequel of the 
inquiry through which I propose to accompany

receive further confirmation from facts and argu- 
ments hitherto unnoticed. If the road over which 
you will still have to pass should in some places

  lect that you are in quest of information on a 
subject the most momentous which can engage 
the attention of a free people; that the field 
through which you have to travel is in itself 
spacious, and that the difficulties of the journey 
have been unnecessarily increased by the mazes 
with which sophistry has beset the way. It will 
be my aim to remove the obstacles to your 
progress in as compendious a manner as it ean 
be done without sacrificing utility to dispatch. 
In pursuance of the plan which I have laid 
down for the diseussion of the subjeet, the point 
next in order to be examined is the ‘‘insufficiency 
of the present confederation to the preservation 
of the Union.’’ 
It may perhaps be asked what need there is 
of reasoning or proof to illustrate a position 
which is neither controverted nor doubted; to 
which the understandings and feelings of all 
classes of men assent; and which in substance is 
admitted by the opponents as well as by the 
friends of the new constitution? It must in 
truth be acknowledged that, however these may 
differ in other respects, they in general appear 
to harmonize in the opinion that there are mate- 
rial imperfections in our national system, and 
that something is necessary to be done to rescue 
us from impending anarchy. The facts that sup- 
port this opinion are no longer objects of specu- 
Jation. They have forced themselves upon the 
sensibility of the people at large, and have at 
length extorted from those whose mistaken pol- 
icy has had the principal share in precipitating 
the extremity at which we are arrived, a reluctant 
confession of the reality of many of those defects 
124
-P-A-G-E-138
  ALEXANDER HAMILTON 
  in the scheme of our federal government whieh 
have been long pointed out and regretted by the 
intelligent friends of the Union. 
We may, indeed, with propriety be said to have 
reached almost the last stage of national humilia- 
tion. There is searcely anything that can wound 
the pride, or degrade the character of an inde- 
pendent people which we do not experience. Are 
there engagements, to the performance of which 
we are held by every tie respectable among men? 
These are the subjects of constant and unblushing 
violation. Do we owe debts to foreigners, and 
to our own citizens, contracted in a time of im- 
minent peril, for the preservation of our political 
existence? These remain without any proper or 
satisfactory provision for their discharge. Have 
we valuable territories and important posts in 
the possession of a foreign power, which, by 
express stipulations, ought long sinee to have 
been surrendered? These are still retained, to 
the prejudice of our interests not less than of our 
rights. Are we in a condition to resent or to 
repel the aggression?. We have neither troops, 
nor treasury, nor government. Are we even 
in a condition to remonstrate with dignity? The 
just imputations on our own faith, in respect 
to the same treaty, ought first to be removed. 
Are we entitled, by nature and compact, to a 
free participation in the navigation of the Mis- 
sissippi? Spain excludes us from it. Is public 
eredit an indispensable resource in time of public 
danger? We seem to have abandoned its cause 
as desperate and irretrievable. Is commerce of 
importance to national wealth? Ours is at the 
lowest point of declension. Is respectability in 
125
-P-A-G-E-139
  
THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  
the eyes of foreign powers a safeguard against 
foreign encroachments? The imbecility of our 
government even forbids them to treat with us: 
our ambassadors abroad are the mere pageants 
of mimic sovereignty. 
Is a violent and unnatural decrease in the 
value of land a symptom of national distress? 
The price of improved land, in most parts of the 
country, is much lower than. can be accounted 
for by the quantity of waste land at market, and 
ean only be fully explained by that want of 
private and public confidence which are so alarm- 
ingly prevalent among all ranks, and which have 
a direct tendency to depreciate property of every 
kind. Is private credit the friend and patron of 
industry? That most useful kind which relates 
to borrowing and lending is reduced within the 
narrowest limits, and this still more from an 
opinion of insecurity than from a searcity of 
money. To shorten an enumeration of particulars 
which can afford neither pleasure nor instruc- 
tion, it may in general be demanded what indica- 
tion is there of national disorder, poverty, and 
insignificance that could befall a community so 
peculiarly blest with natural advantages as we 
are, which does not form a part of the dark 
eatalog of our public misfortunes? 
This is the melancholy situation to which we 
have been brought by those very maxims and 
eounsels which would now deter us from adopting 
the proposed constitution; and which, not content 
with having condueted us to the brink of a pree- 
ipice, seem resolved to plunge us into the abyss 
that awaits us below. Here, my countrymen,

ALEXANDER HAMILTON ET 
an enlightened people, let us make a firm stand 
for our safety, our tranquillity, our dignity, our 
reputation. Let us at last break the fatal charm 
which has too long seduced us from the paths 
of felicity and prosperity. 
It is true, as has been before observed, that 
facts too stubborn to be resisted have produced 
a species of general assent to the abstract prop- 
osition that there exist material defects in our 
national system; but the usefulness of the con- 
cession, on the part of the old adversaries of 
federal measures, is destroyed by a strenuous _ 
opposition to a remedy, upon the only principles 
that can give it a chance of success. While they 
admit that the government of the United States 
is destitute of energy, they contend against con- 
ferring upon it those powers which are requisite 
to supply that energy. They seem still to aim 
at things repugnant and irreconcilable; at an 
augmentation of federal authority, without a 
diminution of State authority; at sovereignty in 
the Union, and complete independence in the 
members. They still, in fine, seem to cherish with 
blind devotion the political monster of.an ¢mpe- 
rium in imperio. This renders a full display of 
the principal defects of. the confederation nec- 
essary in order to show that the evils we ex- 
perience do not proceed from minute or partial 
imperfections, but from fundamental errors in 
the structure of the building, which ean not be 
amended otherwise than by an alteration in the 
very elements and main pillars of the fabric. 
The great and radical vice in the construction 
of the existing confederation is in the principle 
of legislation for states or governments in their 
127
-P-A-G-E-141
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  eorporate or collective capacities, and as contra- 
distinguished from the individuals of whom they 
consist. Tho this principle does not run through 
all the powers delegated to the Union; yet it 
pervades and governs those on which the efficacy 
of the rest depends: except as to the rule of 
apportionment, the United States have an indefi- 
nite discretion to make requisitions for men and 
money; but they have no authority to raise either 
by regulations extending to the individual citi- 
zens of America. The consequence of this is 
that, tho in theory their resolutions coneerning 
those objects are laws constitutionally binding on 
the members of the Union, yet in practise they 
are mere recommendations, which the States ob- 
serve or disregard at their option. 
It is a singular instance of the capriciousness 
of the human mind that after all the admoni- 
tions we have had from experience on this head, 
there should still be found men who object to 
the new constitution for deviating from a prin- 
ciple which has been found the bane of the old; 
and which is, in itself, evidently incompatible 
with the idea of a government; a principle, in 
short, which, if it is to be exeeuted at all, must 
substitute the violent and sanguinary ageney of 
the sword to the mild influence of the magistracy.

HIS REASONS FOR NOT DECLINING 
BURR'S CHALLENGE* 
On my expected interview with Col, Burr, I 
think it proper to make some remarks explana- 
tory of my conduct, motives, and views. I was 
certainly desirous of avoiding this interview for 
the most urgent reasons: 
1. My religious and moral principles are 
strongly opposed to the practise of duelling, and 
it would ever give me pain to be obliged to shed 
the blood of a fellow creature in a private com- 
bat forbidden by the law. 
2. My wife and children are extremely dear 
to me, and my life is of the utmost importance 
to them in various views. 
3. I feel a sense of obligation toward my eredi- 
tors, who, in case of accident to me, by the 
forced sale of my property, may be in some 
degree sufferers. I did not think myself at lib- 
erty, as a man of probity, lightly to expose them 
to this hazard. 
4. I am conscious of no ill-will toward Col. 
Burr, distinct from political opposition, which, 
as I trust, has proceeded from pure and upright 
motives. 
Lastly, I shall hazard much and can probably 
gain nothing by the issue of this interview.

Weehawken, N. J., on July 11, 1804. Hamilton, wounded, was taken to his house in the upper part of Manhattan

THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
But it was, as I conceive, impossible to avoid 
it. There were intrinsic difficulties in the thing, 
an artificial embarrassment from the manner of 
proceeding on the part of Col. Burr. 
Intrinsic, because it is not to be denied that 
my animadversion on the political principles, 
character and views of Col. Burr have been ex- 
tremely severe; and on different occasions I, in 
common with many others, have made very un- 
favorable criticisms on particular instances of 
the private conduct of this gentleman. In pro- 
portion as these impressions were entertained 
with sincerity and uttered with motives and for 
purposes which might appear to me commendable 
would be the difficulty (until they could be re- 
moved by evidence of their being erroneous) of 
explanation or apology. The disavowal required 
of me by Col. Burr in a general and indefinite 
form was out of my power, if it had really been 
proper for me to submit to be questioned, but 
I was sincerely of the opinion that this could 
not be, and in this opinion I was confirmed by 
a very moderate and judicious friend whom I 
consulted. Besides that, Col. Burr appeared to 
me to assume, in the first instance, a tone un- 
necessarily peremptory and menacing, and, in 
the second, positively offensive. Yet I wished 
as far as might be practicable to leave a door 
open to accommodation. This, I think, will be 
inferred from the written communication made 
by me and by my directions, and would be con- 
firmed by the conversation between Mr. Van Ness 
and myself which arose out of the subject. I 
am not sure whether, under all the circumstances, 
I did not go further in the attempt to accom- 
130
-P-A-G-E-144

  modate than a punetilious delicacy will justify. 
If so, I hope the motives I have stated will ex- 
euse me. It is not my design by what I have 
said to affix any odium on the conduct of Col. 
Burr in this case. He doubtless has heard of 
animadversions of mine which bore very hard 
upon him, and it is probable that, as usual, they 
were accompanied with some falsehoods. He may 
have supposed himself under the necessity of 
acting as he has done. I hope the ground of 
his proceeding is such as ought to satisfy his 
own conscience. I trust, at the same time, that 
the world will do me the justice to believe that 
I have not censured him on light grounds nor 
from unworthy motives. I certainly have had 
strong reasons for what I have said, tho it is 
possible in some particulars I may have been 
influenced by misconstructions or misinformation. 
It is also my ardent wish that I may have been 
more mistaken than I think I have been, and 
that he, by his future conduct, may show himself 
worthy of all confidence and esteem and prove 
an ornament and a blessing to the country as 
well, because it is possible I may have injured 
Col. Burr, however convinced myself that my 
opinions and declarations may have been well 
founded. 
As for my general principles and temper in 
relation to similar affairs, I have resolved, if 
our interview is conducted in the usual manner, 
and it pleases God to give me the opportunity, 
to reserve and throw away my first fire, and I 
have thoughts even of reserving my second fire, 
and thus giving a double opportunity to Col. 
Burr to pause and reflect. It is not, however, 
181
-P-A-G-E-145
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  my intention to enter into any explanation on 
the ground. Apology, from principle, I hope, 
rather than pride, is out of the question. To 
those who, with me abhorring the practise of 
duelling, may think that I ought on no account 
to have added to the number of examples, I 
answer that my relative situation as well in pub- 
lie as in private, enforcing all the considerations 
which constitute what men of the world denominate 
honor, inspired in me (as I thought) a peculiar 
necessity not to decline the call. The ability to 
be useful in future, whether in resisting mischief 
or in effecting good, in those crises of our publie 
affairs which seem lately to happen would prob- 
ably be inseparable from a conformity with pub- 
lie prejudice in this particular.® 
S Among the Hamilton papers is a letter addrest as fol- 
lows to Mrs. Hamilton, dated the day before the duel: 
“This letter, my dear Eliza, will not be delivered to you 
unless I shall first have terminated my earthly career, to 
begin, as I humbly hope from redeeming grace and divine 
mercy, a happy immortality. If it had been possible for 
me to have avoided the interview, my love for you and my 
precious children would have been alone a decisive motive. 
But it was not possible without sacrifice which would have 
rendered me unworthy of your esteem. I need not tell you 
of the pangs I feel from the idea of quitting you and 
exposing you to the anguish I know you would feel. Nor 
could I dwell on the topic lest it should unman me, The 
eonsolations of religion, my beloved, can alone support you; 
and these you have a right to enjoy. Fly to the bosom 
of your God and be comforted. With my last idea I shall 
cherish the sweet hope of meeting you in a better world.

TERE is not a virtue that can abide in the 
female heart but it was the ornament of hers. 
She had been fifty-four years the delight of my 
father’s heart, the sweetener of all his toils, 
the comforter of all his sorrows, the sharer and 
heightener of all his joys. It was but the last 
time when I saw my father that he told me,

  struggles and in all his sorrows, the affectionate 
participation and cheering encouragement of his 
wife had been his never-failing support, without 
which he was sure he should never have lived 
through them. 
Never have I known another human being the 
perpetual object of whose life was so unremit- 
tingly to do good. It was a necessity of her 
nature. Yet so unostentatious, so unconscious 
even of her own excellence that even the objects 
of her kindness often knew not whenee it 
came. She had seen the world—its glories with- 
out being dazzled; its vices and follies without 
being infected by them. She had suffered often 
and severely from fits of long and painful siek- 
ness, always with calmness and resignation. She 
had a profound, but not an obtrusive sensibility. 
She was always cheerful, never frivolous; she 
had neither gall nor guile. 
Her attention to the domestic economy of her 
family was unrivaled—rising with the dawn, and 
superintending the household concerns with in- 
defatigable and all-foreseeing care. She had a 
warm and lively relish for literature, for social 
conversation, for whatever was interesting in the 
oceurrences of the time, and even in political 
affairs. She had been, during the war of our 
Revolution, an ardent patriot, and the earliest 
lesson of unbounded devotion to the cause of 
their country that her children received was from 
her. She had the most delicate sense of propriety 
of conduct, but nothing uncharitable, nothing 
bitter. Her price was indeed above rubies.

THE MORAL TAINT INHERENT IN 
SLAVERY ®* 
Arter this meeting I walked home with Cal- 
houn, who said that the principles which I had 
avowed were just and noble; but that in the 
Southern country, whenever they were mentioned, 
they were always understood as applying only to 
white men. Domestic labor was confined to the 
blacks, and such was the prejudice that if he, 
who was the most popular man in his district, 
were to keep a white servant in his house, his 
character and reputation would be irretrievably 
ruined. 
I said that this confounding of the ideas of 
servitude and labor was one of the bad effects 
of slavery; but he thought it attended with many 
excellent consequences. It did not apply to all 
kinds of labor—not, for example, to farming. 
He himself had often held the plow; so had 
his father. Manufacturing and mechanical labor 
was not degrading. It was only manual labor— 
the proper work of slaves. No white person 
eould descend to that. And it was the best 
guarantee to equality among the whites. It pro- 
duced an unvarying level among them. It not 
only did not excite, but did not even admit of 
inequalities by which one white man could dom- 
ineer over another.

  same light. It is, in truth, all perverted senti- 
ment—mistaking labor for slavery, and dominion 
for freedom. The discussion of the Missouri 
question has betrayed the secret of their souls. 
In the abstract they admit that slavery is an 
evil, they disclaim all participation in the intro- 
duction of it, and cast it all upon the shoulders 
of our old granddam Britain. But when probed to 
the quick upon it, they show at the bottom of 
their souls pride and vainglory in their condition 
of masterdom. They fancy themselves more gen- 
erous and noble-hearted than the plain freemen 
who labor for subsistence. They look down upon 
the simplicity of a Yankee’s manners, because 
he has no habits of overbearing like theirs and 
ean not treat negroes like dogs. 
Tt is among the evils of slavery that it taints 
the very sources of moral principle. It estab- 
lishes false estimates of virtue and vice; for what 
ean be more false and heartless than this doc- 
trine which makes the first and holiest rights 
of humanity to depend upon the color of the 
skin? It perverts human reason, and reduces 
man endowed with logical powers to maintain 
that slavery is sanctioned by the Christian re- 
ligion, that slaves are happy and contented in 
their condition, that between master and slave 
there are ties of mutual attachment and affection, 
that the virtues of the master are refined and 
exalted by the degradation of the slave; while 
at the same time they vent execrations upon the 
slave-trade, curse Britain for having given them 
slaves, burn at the stake negroes convicted of © 
crimes for the terror of the example, and writhe 
in agonies of fear at the very mention of human

rights as applicable to men of color. The im- 
pression produced upon my mind by the progress 
of this discussion is that the bargain between 
freedom and slavery contained in the Constitu- 
tion of the United States is morally and political- 
ly vicious, inconsistent with the principles upon , 
whieh alone our Revolution ean be justified; cruel 
and oppressive, by riveting the chains of slavery, 
by pledging the faith of freedom to maintain 
and perpetuate the tyranny of the master; and 
grossly unequal and impolitic, by admitting that 
slaves are at once enemies to be kept in subjec- 
tion, property to be secured or restored to their 
owners, and persons not to be represented them- 
selves, but for whom their masters are privileged 
with nearly a double share of representation: 
The consequence has been that this slave rep- 
resentation has governed the Union. Benjamin 
portioned above his brethren has ravened as a 
wolf. In the morning he has devoured the prey, 
and at night he has divided the spoil. It would 
be no difficult matter to prove, by reviewing the 
history of the Union under this Constitution, that 
almost everything which has contributed to the 
honor and welfare of the nation has been accom- 
plished in despite of them or forced upon them, 
and that everything unpropitious and dishonor- 
able, including the blunders and follies of their 
adversaries, may be traced to them. I have fa- 
vored this Missouri compromise, believing it to 
be all that could be effected under the present 
Constitution, and from extreme unwillingness to 
put the Union at hazard. But perhaps it would 
have been a wiser as well as a bolder course to 
have persisted in the restriction upon Missouri,

  till it should have terminated in a convention of 
the States to amend and revise the Constitution. 
This would have produced a new Union of thir- 
teen or fourteen States unpolluted with slavery, 
with a great and glorious object to effect, namely, 
‘that of rallying to their standard the other States 
by the universal emancipation of their slaves. 
If the Union must be dissolved, slavery is pre- 
cisely the question upon which it ought to break. 
For the present, however, this contest is laid 
asleep.

OF GREATNESS IN NAPOLEON* 
We close our view of Bonaparte’s character 
by saying that his original propensities, released 
from restraint, and pampered by indulgence to 
a degree seldom allowed to mortals, grew up into 
a spirit of despotism as stern and absolute as 
ever usurped the human heart. The love of pow- 
er and supremacy absorbed, consumed him. No 
other passion, no domestic attachment, no private 
friendship, no love of pleasure, no relish for let- 
ters or the arts, no human sympathy, no human 
weakness, divided his mind with the passion for 
dominion and for dazzling manifestations of his 
power. Before this, duty, honor, love, humanity 
fell prostrate. Josephine, we are told, was dear 
to him; but the devoted wife, who had stood 
firm and faithful in the day of his doubtful for- 
tunes, was cast off in his prosperity to make 
room for a stranger, who might be more sub-

  servient to his power. He was affectionate, we 
are told, to his brothers and mother; but his 
brothers, the moment they ceased to be his tools, 
were disgraced; and his mother, it is said, was 
not allowed to sit in the presence of her imperial 
son. He was sometimes softened, we are told, 
by the sight of the field of battle strewn with 
the wounded and dead. But, if the Moloch of 
his ambition claimed new heaps of slain to- 
morrow, it was never denied. With all his sen- 
sibility, he gave millions to the sword with as 
little eompunction as he would have brushed 
away so many insects which had infested his 
march; To him all human will, desire, power 
were to bend. His superiority none might ques- 
tion. He insulted the fallen, who had contracted 
the guilt of opposing his progress; and not even 
woman’s loveliness, and the dignity of a queen 
could give shelter from his contumely. His allies 
were his vassals, nor was their vassalage concealed. 
Too lofty to use the arts of conciliation, preferring 
command to persuasion, overbearing, and all-grasp- 
ing, he spread distrust, exasperation, fear, and 
revenge through Europe; and, when the day of 
retribution came, the old antipathies and mutual 
jealousies of nations were swallowed up in one 
burning purpose to prostrate the common tyrant, 
the universal foe. 
Such was Napoleon Bonaparte. But some will 
say he was still a great man. This we mean not 
to deny. But we would have it understood that 
there are various kinds or orders of greatness, 
and that the highest did not belong to Bonaparte. 
There are different orders of greatness. Among 
these the first rank is unquestionably due to 
140
-P-A-G-E-154
EEO EEO ood 
WILLIAM E. CHANNING 
  moral greatness, or magnanimity; to that sublime 
energy by which the soul, smitten with the love 
of virtue, binds itself indissolubly, for life and 
for death, to truth and duty; espouses as its own 
the interests of human nature; scorns all mean- 
ness and defies all peril; hears in its own con- 
science a voice louder than threatenings and: 
thunders; withstands all the powers of the uni- 
verse which would sever it from the cause of 
freedom and religion; reposes an unfaltering 
trust in God in the darkest hour, and is ever 
‘tready to be offered up’’ on the altar of its 
country or of mankind. 
Of this moral greatness, which throws all other 
forms of greatness into obscurity, we see not a 
trace in Napoleon. Tho clothed with the power 
of a god, the thought of consecrating himself 
to the introduction of a new and higher era, to | 
the exaltation of the character and condition 
of his race, seems never to have dawned on his 
mind. The spirit of disinterestedness and self- 
sacrifice seems not to have waged a moment’s 
war with self-will and ambition. His ruling pas- 
sions, indeed, were singularly at variance with 
magnanimity. Moral greatness has too much sim- 
plicity, is too unostentatious, too self-subsistent 
and enters into others’ interests with too much 
heartiness, to live an hour for what Napoleon 
always lived, to make itself the theme, and gaze, 
and wonder of a dazzled world. Next to moral, 
eomes intellectual greatness, or genius in the 
highest sense of that word; and by this we mean 
that sublime eapacity of thought, through which 
the soul, smitten with the love of the true and 
the beautiful, essays to comprehend the universe, 
141

  soars into the heavens, penetrates the earth, pene- 
trates itself, questions the past, anticipates the 
future, traces out the general and all-compre- 
hending laws of nature, binds together by in- 
numerable affinities and relations all the objects 
of its knowledge, rises from the finite and transi- 
ent to the infinite and the everlasting, frames to 
itself from its own fulness lovelier and sublimer 
forms than it beholds, discerns the harmonies 
between the world within and the world without 
us, and finds in every region of the universe 
types and interpreters of its own deep mysteries 
and glorious inspirations. This is the greatness 
which belongs to philosophers, and to the master- 
spirits in poetry and the fine arts. 
Next comes the greatness of action; and iby 
this we mean the sublime power of conceiving 
bold and extensive plans; of constructing and 
bringing to bear on a mighty object a complicated 
machinery of means, energies, and arrangements, 
and of accomplishing great outward effects. To 
this head belongs the greatness of Bonaparte, 
and that he possest it we need not prove, and 
none will be hardy enough to deny. A man who 
raised himself from obscurity to a throne, who 
changed the face of the world, who made himself 
felt through powerful and civilized nations, who 
sent the terror of his name across seas and 
oceans, whose will was pronounced and feared 
as destiny, whose donatives were crowns, whose 
antechamber was thronged by submissive princes, 
who broke down the awful barrier of the Alps 
and made them a highway, and whose fame was 
spread beyond the boundaries of civilization to 
the steppes of the Cossack, and the deserts of the

Arab; a man who has left this record of himself

accompanied with innumerable vines that here

  as she passed over the earth, and, opening her 
stores, to have strewed with unsparing hand the 
diversified seeds from which have sprung all the 
beautiful and splendid forms which I should in 
vain attempt to describe, that the mocking-bird 
should have fixt its abode—there only that its 
wondrous song should be heard. 
But where is that favored land? It is in that 
great continent to whose distant shores Europe 
has sent forth her adventurous sons, to wrest 
for themselves a habitation from the wild in- 
habitants of the forest, and to convert the neg- 
lected soil into fields of exuberant fertility. It 
is, reader, in Louisiana that these bounties of 
nature are in the greatest perfection. It is there 
that you should listen to the love song of the 
mocking-bird, as T at this moment do. See how - 
he flies round his mate, with motions as light 
-as those of the butterfly! His tail is widely 
expanded, he mounts in the air to a small dis- 
tance, describes a circle, and, again alighting, 
approaches his beloved one, his eyes gleaming 
with delight, for she has already promised to be 
his and his only. His beautiful wings are gently 
raised, he bows to his love, and, again bouncing 
upward, opens his bill and pours forth his mel- 
ody, full of exultation at the conquest he has 
made. 
They are not the soft sounds of the flute or 
the hautboy that I hear, but the sweeter notes 
of nature’s own music. The mellowness of the 
song, the varied modulations and gradations, the 
extent of its compass, the great brilliancy of © 
execution are unrivaled. There is probably no 
bird in the world that possesses all the musical

  qualifications of this king of song, who has de- 
rived all from Nature’s self. Yes, reader, all! 
No sooner has he again alighted, and the con- 
jugal contract has been sealed, than, as if his 
breast were about to be rent with delight, he 
again pours forth his notes with more softness 
and richness than before. He now soars higher, 
glancing around with a vigilant eye, to assure 
himself that none has witnessed his bliss. When 
these love scenes are over, he dances through 
the air, full of animation and delight, and, as if 
to convince his lovely mate that to enrich her 
hopes he has much more love in store, he that 
moment begins anew, and imitates all the notes 
which nature has imparted to the other songsters 
of the grove.

  and unrelenting of all ancient spinsters, destined 
them to inextricable confusion. 
To say merely that he was a hero‘ would be 
doing him great injustice—he was in truth a 
combination of heroes—for he was of a sturdy, 
raw-boned make like Ajax Telamon, with a pair 
of round shoulders that Hercules would have 
given his hide for (meaning his lion’s hide) 
when he undertook to ease old Atlas of his load. 
He was, moreover, as Plutarch describes Corio- 
lanus, not only terrible for the force of his arm, 
but likewise of his voice, which sounded as tho 
it eame out of a barrel; and, like the self-same 
warrior, he possest a sovereign contempt for the 
sovereign people, and an iron aspect, which was 
enough of itself to make the very bowels of his 
adversaries quake with terror and dismay. All 
this martial excellency of appearance was in- 
expressibly heightened by an accidental advan- 
tage, with which I am surprized that neither 
Homer nor Virgil have graced any of their 
heroes. This was nothing less than a wooden 
leg? which was the only prize he had gained in 
bravely fighting the battles of his country, but 
of which he was so proud that he was often 
heard to declare he valued it more than all his 
other limbs put together; indeed, so highly did he

of the colony of Curacao. In 1636 he was made director- 
general of the Dutch colony in North America. He retained 
this office, in which he was notably efficient, until the sur- 
render of New Amsterdam to the English in 1664. Stuy- 
vesant spent the remainder of his life in New York on a 
farm called the Bowery, where he died in 1672. He was

  esteem it that he had it gallantly enchased and 
relieved with silver devices, which caused it to 
be related in divers histories and legends that he 
wore a silver leg. 
Like that cholerie warrior Achilles, he was 
somewhat subject to extempore bursts of passion, 
which were rather unpleasant to his favorites and 
attendants, whose perceptions he was apt to 
quicken, after the manner of his illustrious imita- 
tor, Peter the Great, by anointing their shoulders 
with his walking-staff. 
Tho I can not find that he had read Plato, 
or Aristotle, or Hobbes, or Bacon, or Algernon 
Sydney, or Tom Paine, yet did he sometimes 
manifest a shrewdness and sagacity in his meas- 
ures that one would hardly expect from a man 
who did not know Greek, and had never studied 
the ancients. True it is, and I confess it with 
sorrow, that he had an unreasonable aversion 
to experiments, and was fond of governing his 
provinee after the simplest manner; but then 
he contrived to keep it in better order than did 
the erudite Kieft,> tho, he had all the philosoph- 
ers, ancient and modern, to assist and perplex 
him. I must likewise own that he made but 
very few laws; but then again he took care that 
those few were rigidly and impartially enforeed:

of sage acts and statutes yearly made, and daily 
neglected and forgotten. 
He was, in fact, the very reverse of his pred- 
ecessors, being neither tranquil and inert, like 
Walter the Doubter, nor restless and fidgeting, 
like William the Testy; but a man, or rather a 
governor of such uncommon activity and decision 
of mind that he never sought nor accepted the 
advice of others; depending bravely upon his 
single head, as would a hero of yore upon his 
single arm, to carry him through all difficulties 
and dangers. To tell the simple truth, he wanted. 
nothing more to complete him as a statesman 
than to think always right; for no one can say 
but that he always acted as he thought. He 
was never a man to flinch when he found himself 
in a serape; but to dash forward through thick 
and thin, trusting, by hook or by crook, to make 
all things straight in the end. In a word, he 
possest, in an eminent degree, that great quality 
in a statesman, called perseverance by the polite, 
but nicknamed obstinacy by the vulgar. A won- 
derful salve for official blunders; since he who 
perseveres in error without flinching gets the 
eredit of boldness and consistency, while he who 
wavers in seeking to do what is right gets stig- 
matized as a trimmer. This much is certain; 
_and it is a maxim well worthy the attention of 
all legislators, great and small, who stand shaking 
in the wind, irresolute which way to steer, that 
a ruler who follows his own will pleases himself; 
while he who seeks to satisfy the wishes and whims 
of others runs great risk of pleasing nobody.

  foot resolutely, when in doubt, and letting things 
take their course. The clock that stands still 
points right twice in the four-and-twenty hours: 
while others may keep going continually and be 
continually going wrong. 
Nor did this magnanimous quality escape the 
discernment of the good people of Nieuw Neder- 
landts; on the contrary, so much were they struck 
with the independent will and vigorous resolu- 
tion displayed on all occasions by their new gov- 
ernor, that they universally called him Hard- 
Koppig Piet; or Peter the Headstrong—a great 
eompliment to the strength of his understanding. 
Tf, from all that I have said, thou dost not 
gather, worthy reader, that Peter Stuyvesant was 
a tough, sturdy, valiant, weather-beaten, mettle- 
some, obstinate, leather-sided, lion-hearted, gen- 
erous-spirited old governor, either I have written 
to but little purpose, or thou art very dull at

  twittering among the bushes, and the eagle was 
wheeling aloft, and breasting the pure mountain 
breeze. ‘‘Surely,’’ thought Rip, ‘‘I have not 
slept here all night.’’ He recalled the oceur- 
rences before he fell asleep. The strange man 
with a keg of liquor—the mountain ravine—the 
wild retreat among the rocks—the wo-begone 
party at nine-pins—the flagon—‘‘Oh! that flag- 
on! that wicked flagon!’’ thought Rip—‘ what 
excuse shall I make to Dame Van Winkle!’’ 
He looked round for his gun, but in place of 
the clean well-oiled fowling-piece, he found an 
old firelock lying by him, the barrel inerusted 
with rust, the lock falling off, and the stock 
worm-eaten. He now suspected that the grave 
roysterers of the mountain had put a trick upon 
him, and, having dosed him with liquor, had 
robbed him of his gun. Wolf, too, had disap- 
peared, but he might have strayed away after 
a squirrel or partridge. He whistled after him 
and shouted his name, but all in vain; the echoes 
repeated his whistle and shout, but no dog was 
to be seen. 
He determined to revisit the scene of the last 
evening’s gambol, and if he met with any of 
the party, to demand his dog and gun. As he 
rose to walk, he found himself stiff in the joints, 
aud wanting in his usual activity. ‘‘These moun- 
tain beds do not agree with me,’’ thought Rip, 
‘¢and if this frolie should lay me up with a fit 
of the rheumatism, I shall have a blest time 
with Dame Van Winkle.’’? With some difficulty 
he got down into the glen: he found the gully 
up which he and his companion had ascended 
the preceding evening; but to his astonishment 
152
-P-A-G-E-166
  WASHINGTON IRVING 
— 
a mountain stream was now foaming down it, 
leaping from rock to rock, and filling the glen 
with babbling murmurs. He, however, made shift 
to scramble up its sides, working his toilsome 
way through thickets of birch, sassafras, and 
witch-hazel, and sometimes tript up or entangled 
by the wild grape-vines that twisted their coils 
or tendrils from tree to tree, and spread a kind 
of network in his path. 
At length he reached to where the ravine had. 
opened through the cliffs to the amphitheater; 
but no traces of such opening remained. The 
rocks presented a high impenetrable wall over 
which the torrent came tumbling in a sheet of 
feathery foam, and fell into a broad deep basin, 
black from the shadows of the surrounding forest. 
Here, then, poor Rip was brought to a stand. 
He again called and whistled after his dog; he 
was only answered by the cawing of a flock of 
idle crows, sporting high in air about a dry tree 
that overhung a sunny precipice; and who, secure 
in their elevation, seemed to look down and scoff 
at the poor man’s perplexities. What was to be 
done? the morning was passing away, and Rip 
felt famished for want of his breakfast. He 
grieved to give up his dog and gun; he dreaded 
to meet his wife; but it would not do to starve 
among the mountains. He shook his head, shoul- 
dered the rusty firelock, and, with a heart full 
of trouble and anxiety, turned his steps home- 
ward. 
As he approached the village he met a number 
of people, but none whom he knew, which some- 
what surprized him, for he had thought himself 
acquainted with every one in the country round.

  Their dress, too, was of a different fashion. from 
that to which he was accustomed. They all stared 
at him with equal marks of surprize, and when- 
ever they cast their eyes upon him, invariably 
stroked their chins. The constant reeurrence of 
this gesture induced Rip, involuntarily, to do the 
same, when, to his astonishment, he found his 
beard had grown a foot long! 
He had now entered the skirts of the village. 
A troop of strange children ran at his heels, 
hooting after him, and pointing at his gray beard. 
The dogs, too, not one of which he recognized 
for an old acquaintance, barked at him as he 
passed. The very village was altered; it was 
larger and more populous, There were rows of 
houses which he had never seen before, and those 
. whieh had been his familiar haunts had disap- 
peared. Strange names were over the doors— 
strange faces at the windows—everything was 
strange. His mind now misgave him; he began 
to doubt whether both he and the world around 
him were not bewitched. Surely this was his 
native village, which he had left but the day 
before. There stood the Catskill Mountains— 
there ran the silver Hudson at a distance—there 
was every hill and dale precisely as it had always 
been—Rip was sorely perplexed—‘‘That flagon 
last night,’’? thought he, ‘‘has addled my poor 
head sadly!’’ 
It was with some difficulty that he found the 
way to his own house, which he approached with 
silent awe, expecting every moment to hear the

house gone to decay—the roof fallen in, the win-

  half-starved dog that looked like Wolf was skulk- 
ing about it. Rip called him by name, but the 
cur snarled, showed his teeth, and passed on. 
This was an unkind cut indeed—‘My very dog,’’ 
sighed poor Rip, ‘‘has forgotten me!’’ 
He entered the house, which, to tell the truth, 
Dame Van Winkle had always kept in neat order. 
It was empty, forlorn, and apparently abandoned. 
This desolateness overcame all his connubial 
fears—he called loudly for his wife and children 
—the lonely chambers rang for a moment with 
his voice, and then all again was silence. 
He now hurried forth, and hastened to his old 
resort, the village inn—but it too was gone. A 
large rickety wooden building stood in its place, 
with great gaping windows, some of them broken 
and mended with old hats and petticoats, and 
over the door was painted, ‘‘The Union Hotel, 
by Jonathan Doolittle.’’ Instead of the great 
tree that used to shelter the quiet little Dutch 
inn of yore, there now was reared a tall naked 
pole, with something on the top that looked like 
a red night-cap, and from it was fluttering a flag, 
on which was a singular assemblage of stars and 
stripes—all this was strange and incomprehen- 
sible. He recognized on the sign, however, the 
ruby face of King George, under which he had 
smoked so many a peaceful pipe; but even this 
was singularly metamorphosed. The red coat 
was changed for one of blue and buff, a sword 
was held in the hand instead of a scepter, the 
head was deeorated with a cocked hat, and under- 
neath was painted in large characters, GenERAL 
WasuHINGTON. 
There was, as usual, a crowd of folk about the 
155

door, but none that Rip recollected. The very 
character of the people seemed changed. There 
was a busy, bustling, disputatious tone about 
it, instead of the accustomed phlegm and drowsy 
tranquillity. He looked in vain for the sage 
Nicholas Vedder, with his broad face, double 
chin, and fair long pipe, uttering clouds of _to- 
baceo-smoke instead of idle speeches; or Van 
Bummel, the schoolmaster, doling forth the eon- 
tents of an ancient newspaper. In place of these, 
a lean, bilious-looking fellow, with his pockets full 
of handbills, was haranguing vehemently about 
rights of citizens—elections—~—members of Con- 
gress—liberty—Bunker Hill—heroes of seventy- 
six—-and other words, which were a perfect Baby- 
lonish jargon to the bewildered Van Winkle. 
The appearance of Rip, with his long grizzled 
beard, his rusty fowling-piece, his uncouth dress, 
and an army of women and children at his heels, 
soon attracted the attention of the tavern po- 
liticians. They crowded round him, eyeing him 
from head to foot with great curiosity. The 
orator bustled up to him, and, drawing him partly 
aside, inquired ‘‘on which side he voted???’ Rip 
stared in vacant stupidity. Another short but 
busy litile fellow pulled him by the arm, and, risi 
on tiptoe, inquired in his ear ‘‘whether he was 
Federal or Democrat?’’ Rip was equally at a 
loss to comprehend the question; when a know- 
ing, self-important old gentleman, in a sharp 
eocked hat, made his way through the crowd, 
putting them to right and left with his elbows as 
he passed, and planting himself before Van Win- 
kle, with arms akimbo, the other resting on his 
cane, his keen eyes and sharp hat penetrating,

  as it were, into his very soul, demanded in an 
austere tone ‘‘what brought him to the election 
with a gun on his shoulder, and a mob at his 
heels, and whether he meant to breed a riot in 
the village?’’ ‘Alas! gentlemen,’’ eried Rip, 
somewhat dismayed, ‘‘I am a poor quiet man, 
a native of the place, and a loyal subject of the 
King, God bless him!’’ 
Here a general shout burst from the bystand- 
ers—‘A Tory! a Tory! a spy! a refugee! hustle 
him! away with him!’’ It was with great dif- 
fieulty that the self-important man in the cocked 
hat restored order; and, having assumed a ten- 
fold austerity of brow, demanded again of the 
unknown culprit what he came there for, and 
whom he was seeking? The poor man humbly 
assured him that he meant no harm, but merely 
came there in search of some of his neighbors, 
who used to keep about the tavern. 
‘¢Well—who are they ?—name them.’’ 
Rip bethought himself a moment, and inquired, 
‘¢Where’s Nicholas Vedder?’’ 
There was a silence for a little while, when 
an old man replied, in a thin piping voice, ‘‘ Nich- 
olas Vedder! why, he is dead and gone these 
eighteen years! There was a wooden tombstone 
in the churchyard that used to tell all about 
him, but that’s rotten and gone téo.’’ 
‘*Where’s Brom Dutcher?’’ 
‘¢Oh, he went off to the army in the beginning 
of the war; some say he was killed at the storm- 
ing of Stony Point—others say he was drowned 
in a squall at the foot of Antony’s Nose. I don’t 
know—he never came back again.’’ 
‘*Where’s Van Bummel, the schoolmaster ?’’ 
157
-P-A-G-E-171
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  ‘‘He went off to the wars too, was a great 
militia general, and is now in Congress.’’ 
Rip’s heart died away at hearing of these sad 
ehanges in his home and friends, and finding 
himself thus alone in the world. Every answer 
puzzled him too, by treating of such enormous 
lapses of time, and of matters which he could 
not understand: war-—Congress—Stony Point; 
he had no courage to ask after any more friends, 
but eried out in despair, ‘‘Does nobody here 
know Rip Van Winkle?’’ 
‘Oh, Rip Van Winkle!’’ exclaimed two or 
three—‘‘oh, to be sure! that’s Rip Van Winkle 
yonder, leaning against the tree.’’ 
Rip looked, and beheld a precise counterpart 
of himself, as he went up the mountain: appar- 
ently as lazy, and certainly as ragged. The poor 
fellow was now completely confounded. He 
doubted his own identity, and whether he was 
himself or another man. In the midst of his 
bewilderment, the man in the cocked hat de- 
manded who he was, and what was his name? 
‘(God knows,’’ exclaimed he, at his wit’s end; 
*“T’m not myself—I’m somebody else—that’s me 
yonder—no—that’s somebody else got into my 
shoes—I was myself last night, but I fell asleep 
on the mountain, and they’ve changed my gun, 
and everything’s changed, and I’m changed, and 
I can’t tell what’s my name, or who I am!’’ 
The bystanders began now too look at each 
other, nod, wink significantly, and tap their fin- 
gers against their foreheads. There was a whis- 
per, also, about securing the gun, and keeping 
the old fellow from doing mischief, at the very 
suggestion of which the self-important man in 
158

the cocked hat retired with some precipitation. 
At this critical moment a fresh comely woman 
prest through the throng to get a peep at the 
gray-bearded man. She had a chubby child in 
her arms, which, frightened at his looks, began 
to ery. ‘‘Hush, Rip,’’ eried she, ‘‘hush, you little 
fool; the old man won’t hurt you.’’ The name of 
the child, the air of the mother, the tone of her 
voice, all awakened a train of recollections in 
his mind. ‘‘What is your name, my good wom- 
an,’’ asked he. 
‘Judith Gardenier.’’ 
‘¢And your father’s name?’ 
‘* Ah, poor man, Rip Van Winkle was his name, 
but it’s twenty years since he went away from 
home with his gun, and never has been heard 
of since—his dog came home without him; but 
whether he shot himself, or was carried away 
by the Indians, nobody can tell. I was then but 
a little girl.’’ 
Rip had but one question more to ask; but 
he put it with a faltering voice: 
‘¢Where’s your mother?’’ 
‘Oh, she too had died but a short time since; 
she broke a blood-vessel in a fit of passion at a 
New England peddler.’’ 
There was a drop of comfort, at least, in this 
intelligence. The honest man could contain him- 
self no longer. He caught his daughter and her 
child in his arms. ‘‘I am your father!’’ eried 
he—‘‘ Young Rip Van Winkle once—old Rip Van 
Winkle now!—Does nobody know poor Rip Van 
Winkle?’’ 
All stood amazed, until an old woman, totter- 
ing out from among the crowd, put her hand to 
159
-P-A-G-E-173

  her brow, and peering under it in his face for 
a moment, exclaimed, ‘‘Sure enough! it is Rip 
Van Winkle—it is himself! Welcome home 
again, old neighbor—why, where have you been 
these twenty long years?’’ . 
Rip’s stery was soon told, for the whole twenty 
years had been to him but as one night. The 
neighbors stared when they heard it; some were 
seen to wink at each other, and put their tongues 
in their cheéks: and the self-important man 
in the cocked hat, who, when the alarm was over, 
had returned to the field, serewed down the cor- 
ners of his mouth, and shook his head—upon 
which there was a general shaking of the head 
throughout the assemblage. 
It was determined, however, to take the opin- 
ion of old Peter Vanderdonk, who was seen slow- 
ly advancing up the road. He was a descendant 
of the historian of that name, who wrote one 
of the earliest accounts of the province. Peter 
was the most ancient inhabitant of the village, 
and well versed in all the wonderful events and 
traditions of the neighborhood. He recollected 
Rip at once, and corroborated his story in the 
most satisfactory manner. He assured the com- 
pany that it was a fact, handed down from his 
ancestor the historian, that the Catskill Moun- 
tains had always been haunted by strange beings. 
That it was affirmed that the great. Hendrick 
Hudson, the first discoverer of the river and 
country, kept a kind of vigil there every twenty 
years, with his crew of the Half-moon; being 
permitted in this way to revisit the scenes of 
his enterprise, and keep a guardian eye upon 
the river, and the great city called by his name.

  That his father had once seen them in their old 
Dutch dresses playing at ninepins in a hollow of 
the mountain; and that he himself had heard, 
one summer afternoon, the sound of their balls, 
like distant peals of thunder. 
To make a long story short, the company broke 
up, and returned to the more important concerns 
of the election. Rip’s daughter took him home 
to live with her; she had a snug, well-furnished 
house, and a stout cheery farmer for a husband, 
whom Rip recollected for one of the urchins that 
used to climb upon his back. As to Rip’s son 
and heir, who was the ditto of himself, seen 
leaning against the tree, he was employed to 
work on the farm; but evinced an _ hereditary

AT ABBOTSFORD WITH SCOTT® 
I wap a letter of introduction to him from 
Thomas Campbell the poet, and had reason to 
think, from the interest he had taken in some 
of my earlier scribblings,’ that a visit from me 
would not be deemed an intrusion. 
On the following morning, after an early break- 
fast, I set off in a post-chaise for the Abbey. 
5¥rom the collection of papers entitled “Crayon Mis- 
cellany.” Irvying’s visit was made in 1817. His account 
of it was not published until nearly twenty years afterward 
—that is, after Scott’s death. 
e ‘Irving at that time had published little more than the 
yaomagundi” papers and “Knickerboeker's History of New ork.”

  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  On the way thither I stopt at the gate of Abbots- 
ford, and sent the postilion to the house with 
the letter of introduction and my card, on which 
I had written that I was on my way to the ruins 
of Melrose Abbey, and wished to know whether 
it would be agreeable to Mr. Scott (he had not 
yet been made a baronet) to receive a visit from 
me in the course of the morning. 
In a little while the ‘‘lord of the castle? * him- 
self made his appearance. I knew him at once 
by the descriptions I had read and heard, and 
the likeness that had been published of him. 
He was tall, and of a large and powerful frame. 
His dress was simple, and almost rustie: an old 
green shooting-coat, with a dog-whistle at the 
buttonhole, brown linen pantaloons, stout shoes 
that tied at the ankles, and a white hat that 
had evidently seen service. He came limping up 
the gravel-walk, aiding himself by a stout walking- 
staff, but moving rapidly and with vigor. By his 
side jogged along a large iron-gray stag-hound 
of most grave demeanor, who took no part in the 
clamor of the canine rabble, but seemed to con- 
sider himself bound, for the dignity of the house, 
to give me a courteous reception. 
Before Scott had reached the gate he called 
out in a hearty tone, welcoming me to Abbots- 
ford, and asking news of Campbell. Arrived 
at the door of the chaise, he grasped me warmly 
by the hand: ‘‘Come, drive down, drive down to 
the house,’’ said he, ‘‘ye’re just in time for 
breakfast, and afterward ye shall see all the 
wonders of the Abbey.’’ 
I would have excused myself, on the plea of 
having already made my breakfast. ‘Hout, 
162

  man,’’ cried he, ‘‘a ride in the morning in the 
keen air of the Seotch hills is warrant enough 
for a second breakfast.’’ I was accordingly 
whirled to the portal of the cottage, and in a 
few moments found myself seated at the break- 
fast-table. : 
Scott proposed a ramble to show me something 
of the surrounding country. As we sallied forth, 
every dog in the establishment turned out to 
attend us. There was the old stag-hound Maida, 
a noble animal, and a great favorite of Scott’s; 
and Hamlet, the black greyhound, a wild thought- 
less youngster, not yet arrived to the years of 
discretion; and Finette, a beautiful setter, with 
soft silken hair, long pendent ears, and a mild 
eye, the parlor favorite. When in front of the 
house, we were joined by a superannuated grey- 
hound, who came from the kitchen wagging his 
tail, and was cheered by Scott as an old friend 
and comrade. 
In our walks, Seott would frequently pause 
in conversation to notice his dogs and speak to 
them, as if rational companions; and, indeed, 
there appears to be a vast deal of rationality 
in these faithful attendants on man, derived from 
their close intimacy with him. Maida deported 
himself with a gravity becoming his age and 
size, and seemed to consider himself called upon 
to preserve a great degree of dignity and deco- 
rum in our society. As he jogged along a little 
distance ahead of us, the young dogs would gam- 
bol about him, leap on his neck, worry at his 
ears, and endeavor to tease him into a frolie. 
The old dog would keep on for a long time with 
imperturbable solemnity, now and then seeming 
163
-P-A-G-E-177
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  to rebuke the wantonness of his young com- 
panions. 
We had not ‘walked much further before we 
saw the two Miss Scotts advancing along the 
hillside to meet us. The morning’s studies being 
over, they had set off to take a ramble on the 
hills, and gather heather-blossoms with which to 
decorate their hair for dinner. As they came 
bounding lightly, like young fawns, and their 
dresses fluttering in the pure summer breeze, 
I was reminded of Scott’s own description of 
his children in his introduction to one of the 
eantos of ‘‘Marmion.’’ 
As they approached, the dogs all sprang for- 
ward and gamboled around them. They played 
with them for a time, and then joined us with 
countenances full of health and glee. Sophia,’ 
the eldest, was the most lively and joyous, having 
much of her father’s varied spirit in conversa- 
tion, and seeming to catch excitement, from his 
words and looks. Ann was of quieter mood, rath- 
er silent, owing, in some measure, no doubt, to 
her being some years younger. 
At the dinner Seott had laid by his half-rustie 
dress, and appeared clad in black. The girls, 
too, in completing their toilet, had twisted in 
their hair the sprigs of purple heather which 
they had gathered on the hillside, and looked 
all fresh and blooming from their breezy walk. 
There was no guest at dinner but myself. 
Around the table were two or three dogs in at- 
tendance. Maida, the old stag-hound, took his 
seat at Scott’s elbow, looking up wistfully in his

Lockhart, the biographer of Scott.

master’s eye, while Finette, the pet spaniel, 
placed herself near Mrs. Scott, by whom, I soon 
pereeived, she was completely spoiled. . . 
Among the other important and privileged mem- 
bers of the household who figured in attendance at 
the dinner was a large gray cat, who, I observed, 
was regaled from time to time with titbits from the 
table. This sage grimalkin was a favorite of 
both master and mistress, and slept at night in 
their room; and Scott laughingly observed that 
one of the least wise parts of their establishment 
was that the window was left open at night for 
puss to go in and out. The cat assumed a kind 
of ascendency among the quadrupeds—sitting in 
state in Scott’s armchair, and occasionally sta- 
tioning himself on a chair beside the door, as 
if to review his subjects as they passed, giving 
each dog a euff beside the ears as he went by. 
This clapper-clawing was always taken in good 
part; it appeared to be, in fact, a mere act of 
sovereignty on the part of grimalkin, to remind 
the others of their vassalage; which they ac- 
knowledged by the most perfect acquiescence. 
A general harmony prevailed between sovereign 
and subjects, and they would all sleep together 
in the sunshine. . . - 
After dinner we adjourned to the drawing- 
room, which served also for study and library. 
Against the wall on one side was a long writing- 
table, with drawers; surmounted by a small cab- 
inet of polished wood, with folding-drawers 
richly studded with brass ornaments, within 
which Scott kept his most valuable papers. Above 
the cabinet, in a kind of niche, was a complete 
corselet of glittering steel, with a closed helmet, 
165
-P-A-G-E-179
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  and flanked by gantlets and battle-axes. Around 
were hung trophies and relies of various kinds; 
a simitar of Tipu Sahib; a Highland broad- 
sword from Flodden field; a pair of Rippon 
spurs from Bannockburn, and above all, a gun 
which had belonged to Rob Roy, and bore his 
initials, R. M. C.,° an object of peculiar interest 
to me at the time, as it was understood Scott 
was actually engaged in printing a novel founded 
on the story of that famous outlaw. 
On each side of the cabinet were bookcases, 
well stored with works of romantic fiction in 
various languages, many of them rare and an- 
tiquated. This, however, was merely his cottage 
library, the principal part of his books being at 
Edinburgh. 
From this little cabinet of curiosities Seott 
drew forth a manuscript picked up on the field 
at Waterloo, containing copies of several songs 
popular at the time in France. The paper was 
dabbled with blood—‘‘the very life-blood, very 
possibly,’’ said Scott, ‘‘of some gay young officer 
who had cherished these songs as a keepsake 
from some lady-love in Paris.”? . . . 
The evening passed away delightfully in this 
quaint-looking apartment, half study, half draw- 
ing-room. Scott had read several passages from 
the old romances of Arthur, with a fine deep 
sonorous voice, and a gravity of tone that seemed 
to suit the antiquated black-letter volume. It 
was a: rich treat to hear such a work, read by 
such a person, and in such a place; and his ap- 
pearance as he sat reading, in a large armed

  chair, with his favorite hound Maida at his feet 
and surrounded by books and relics, and border 
trophies, would have formed an admirable and 
most characteristic picture. 
While Seott was reading, the sage grimalkin 
already mentioned had taken his seat in a chair 
beside the fire, and remained with fixt eye and 
grave demeanor, as if listening to the reader. 
I observed to Scott that his cat seemed to have 
a black-letter taste in literature. 
‘‘Ah,’’ said he, ‘‘these cats are a very mys- 
terious kind of folk. There is always more pass- 
ing in their minds than we are aware of. It 
comes, no doubt, from their being so familiar 
with witehes and warlocks.’”? . . . . 
When I retired for the night, I found it aimost 
impossible to sleep; the idea of being under the 
roof of Scott, of being on the borders of the 
Tweed in the very center of that region which 
had for some time past been the favorite scene 
of romantic fiction, and above all, the recollec- 
tions of the ramble I had taken, the company in 
which I had taken it, and the conversation which 
had passed, all fermented in my mind, and nearly 
drove sleep from my pillow. 
On the following morning the sun darted his 
beams from over the hills through the low lattice 
window. I rose at an early hour, and looked out 
between the branches of eglantine which over- 
hung the casement. To my surprize Scott was 
already up and forth, seated on a fragment of 
stone, and chatting with the workmen employed 
on the new building.” I had supposed, after the

be closely occupied this morning; but he ap- 
peared like a man of leisure, who had nothing 
to do but bask in the sunshine and amuse himself. 
I soon drest myself and joined him. He talked 
about his proposed plans of Abbotsford: happy 
would it have been for him could he have ¢on- 
tented himself with his delightful little vine- 
covered cottage, and the simple yet hearty and 
hospitable style in which he lived at the time of 
my visit. The great pile of Abbotsford, with the 
huge expense it entailed upon him, of servants, 
retainers, guests, and baronial style, was a 
drain upon his purse, a tax upon his exertions, 
and a weight. upon his mind, and finally crusht 
After breakfast Scott was occupied for some 
time correcting proof-sheets, which he had re- 
ceived by the mail. The novel of ‘‘Rob Roy,’’” as 
I have already observed, was at that time in the 
press, and I supposed them to be the proof- 
sheets of that work. The authorship of the 
Waverley novels was still a matter of conjecture 
and uncertainty; tho few doubted their being 
principally written by Scott. One proof to me 
of his being the author was that he never ad- 
verted to them. A man so fond of anything 
Scottish, and anything relating to national his- 
tory or local legend, could not have been mute

Near the center of the State of New York lies

is a suecession of hills and dales, or, to speak 
with greater deference to geographical defini-

father, Judge William Cooper, the founder of Cooperstown,

1787 and in 1790 made it the permanent home of his 
family. In 1790 the place contained 35 other people. Thé

flowing from the limpid lakes and thousand 
springs of this region, the numerous sources of 
the Susquehanna meander through the valleys, 
until, uniting their streams, they form one of 
the proudest rivers of the United States. The 
mountains are generally arable to the tops, altho 
instances are not wanting where the sides are 
jutted with rocks, that aid greatly in giving to 
the country that romantic and picturesque char- 
acter which it so eminently possesses. 
The vales are narrow, rich and cultivated, with 
a stream uniformly winding through each. Beau- 
tiful and thriving villages are found interspersed 
along the margins of the small Jakes, or situated 
at those points of the stream which are favorable 
for manufacturing; and neat and comfortable 
farms, with every indication of wealth about 
them, are scattered profusely through the vales, 
and even to the mountain tops. Roads diverge 
in every direction from the even and graceful 
bottoms of the valleys to the most rugged and 
intricate passes of the hills. Academies’ and 
minor edifices of learning meet the eye of the 
stranger at every few miles as he winds his way 
through this uneven territory, and places for the 
worship of God abound with that frequency 
Judge Cooper's settling at Cooperstown was 8 consequence 
of his having acquired, through foreclosure, extensive lands 
which George Croghan had failed in an attempt to settle, 
near the Iske. Except for this circumstance, it is unlikely 
that his son ever would have acquired that intimate knowl- 
edge of Indian and frontier life of which he has left such 
notable pictures in his hooks,

Jt was near the setting of the sun, on a clear, 
cold day in December, when a sleigh was moving 
slowly up one of the mountains in the district 
we have deseribed. The day had been fine for 
the season, and but two or three large clouds, 
whose color seemed brightened by the light re- 
flected from the mass of snow that covered the 
earth, floated in a sky of the purest blue. The 
road wound along the brow of a precipice, and 
on one side was upheld by a foundation of logs, 
piled one upon the other, while a narrow ex- 
eavation in the mountain in the opposite direc- 
tion had made a passage of sufficient width for 
the ordinary traveling of that day. But logs, 
excavation, and everything that did not reach 
several feet above the earth lay alike buried 
beneath the snow. A single track, barely wide 
enough to receive the sleigh, denoted the route 
of the highway, and this was sunk nearly two 
feet below the surrounding surface. 
In the vale, which lay at a distance of several 
hundred feet lower, there was what, in the lan- 
guage of the country, was called a clearing, and 
all the usual improvements of a new: settlement; 
these even extended up the hill to the point 
where the road turned short and ran across the 
level land, which lay on the summit of the 
mountain; but the summit itself remained in 
the forest. There was glittering in the atmos- 
phere, as if it was filled with innumerable shining 
particles; and the noble bay horses that drew

  the sleigh were covered, in many parts, with a 
coat of hoar-frost. The vapor from their nos- 
trils was seen to issue like smoke; and every 
object in the view, as well as every arrangement 
of the travelers, denoted the depth of a winter 
in the mountains. 
The harness, which was of a deep, dull black, | 
differing from the glossy varnishing of the pres- 
ent day, was ornamented with enormous plates 
and buckles of brass, that shone like gold in 
those transient beams of the sun which found 
their way obliquely through the tops of the 
trees. Huge saddles, studded with nails and fitted 
with cloth that served as blankets to the shoul- 
ders of the cattle, supported four high, square- 
topped turrets, through whieh the stout reins 
led from the mouths of the horses to the hands 
of the driver, who was a negro of apparently 
twenty years of age. His face, which Nature 
had colored with a glistening black, was now 
mottled with the eold, and his large shining eyes 
filled with tears; a tribute to its power, that the 
keen frosts of those regions always extracted 
from one of his African origin. Still, there was 
a smiling expression of good humor in his happy 
countenance, that was created by the thoughts 
of home, and a Christmas fireside, with its Christ- 
mas frolics. : 
A dark spot of a few acres in extent at the 
southern extremity of this beautiful flat, and 
immediately under the feet of our travelers, alone 
showed by its rippling surface, and the vapors 
which exhaled from it, that what at first might 
seem a plain was one of the mountain lakes, 
locked in the frosts of winter. A narrow current 
173

  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  rushed impetuously from its bosom at the open 
place we mentioned and was to be traced for 
miles as it wound its way toward the south 
through the real valley, by its borders of hem- 
lock and pine, and by the vapor which arose 
from its warmer surface into the chill atmosphere 
_ of the hills. The banks of this lovely basin, at 
its outlet,’ or southern end, were steep, but not 
high; and in that direction the land continued, 
far as the eye could reach, a narrow but graceful 
valley, along which the settlers had scattered 
their humble habitations, with a profusion that 
bespoke the quality of the soil, and the compara- 
tive facilities of intercourse. 
Immediately on the bank of the lake and at 
its foot stood the village of Templeton.* It con- 
sisted of some fifty buildings, including those 
of every description, chiefly built of wood, and 
which in their architecture bore no great marks 
of taste, but which also, by the unfinished ap- 
pearance of most of the dwellings, indicated the 
hasty manner of their construction. To the eye 
they presented a variety of colors. A few were 
white in both front and rear, but more bore that 
expensive color on their fronts only, while their 
economical but ambitious owners had covered the 
remaining sides of the edifices with a dingy red. 
One or two were slowly assuming the russet of 
age; while the uncovered beams that were to 
be seen through the broken windows on their 
second stories showed that either the taste or 
the vanity of their proprietors had led them to 
®The outlet of this lake is the Susquehanna River. 
*Templeton is another name for Cooperstown.

undertake a task which they were unable to 
accomplish. 
The whole were grouped in a manner that 
aped the streets of the city, and were evidently 
so arranged by the directions of one who looked 
to the wants of posterity rather than to the 
convenience of the present incumbents. Some 
three or four of the better sort of buildings, 
in addition to the uniformity of their color, were 
fitted with green blinds, which, at that season at 
least, were rather strangely contrasted to the 
chill aspect of the lake, the mountains, the for- 
ests, and the wide fields of snow. Before the 
doors of these pretentious dwellings were placed 
a few saplings, either without branches, or 
possessing only the feeble shoots of one or two 
summers’ growth, that looked not unlike tall 
grenadiers on post near the threshold of princes. 
In truth, the occupants of these favored habita- 
tions were the nobles of Templeton, as Marma- 
duke was its king. They were the dwellings of 
two young men who were cunning in the law; 
an equal number of that class who chaffered to 
the wants of the community under the title of 
storekeepers; and a disciple of Aisculapius, who, 
for a novelty, brought more subjects into the 
world than he sent out of it. 
In the midst of this incongruous group of 
dwellings rose the mansion of the Judge, towering 
above all its neighbors. It stood in the center 
of an enclosure of several acres, which was cov- 
ered with fruit-trees. Some of the latter had 
been left by the Indians, and began already to 
assume the moss and inclination of age, therein 
forming a very marked contrast to the infant

  plantations that peered over most of the picketed 
fences of the village. In addition to this show 
of cultivation were two rows of young Lombardy 
poplars, a tree but lately introduced into Amer~ 
iea, formally lining either side of a pathway 
which led from a gate that opened on the prin- 
cipal street to the front door of the building. 
The house itself had been built entirely under 
the superintendence of a certain Mr. Richard 
Jones, whom we have already mentioned, and 
who, from his cleverness in small matters, and 
an entire willingness to exert his talents, added 
to the circumstances of their being sisters’ chil- 
dren, ordinarily superintended all the minor con- 
eerns of Marmaduke Temple. Richard was fond 
of saying that this child of invention consisted 
of nothing more or Jess than what should form the 
groundwork of every clergyman’s discourse, viz., 
a firstly and a lastly. He had commenced his 
labors, in the first year of their residence, by 
erecting a tall, gaunt edifice of wood, with its 
gable toward the highway. In this shelter, for 
it was little more, the family resided three years. 
By the end of that period Richard had completed 
his design. He had availed himself, in this heavy 
undertaking, of the experience of a certain wan- 
dering Eastern mechanic, who, by exhibiting a 
few soiled plates of English architecture, and 
talking learnedly of friezes, entablatures, and 
particularly of the composite order, had obtained 
@ very undue influence over Richard’s taste in 
everything that pertained to that branch of the 
fine arts. Not that Mr. Jones did not affect to 
consider Hiram Doolittle a perfect empiric in his profession, being in the constant habit of 
176
-P-A-G-E-190
  JAMES FENIMORE COOPER 
  listening to his treatises on architecture with a 
kind of indulgent smile; yet, either from an 
inability to oppose them by anything plausible 
from his own stores of learning, or from secret 
admiration, Richard generally submitted to the 
arguments of his coadjutor. 
Together they had not only directed a dwelling 
for Marmaduke, but they had given a fashion 
to the architecture of the whole country. The 
composite order, Mr. Doolittle would contend, 
was an order composed of many others, and 
was intended to be the most useful of all, for 
it admitted into its construction such altera- 
tions as convenience or circumstances might re- 
quire. To this proposition Richard usually as- 
sented; and when rival geniuses, who monopolize 
not only all the reputation, but most of the 
money of the neighborhood, are of a mind, it is 
not uncommon to see them lead the fashion, even 
in graver matters. In the present instance, as 
we have already hinted, the castle, as Judge 
Temple’s dwelling was termed in common par- 
lance, came to be the model, in some one or 
other of its numerous excellences, for every 
aspiring edifice within twenty miles of it.’ 
8 Judge Cooper’s new home was called Otsego Hall. It 
was afterward improved by Fenimore Cooper and remained 
his home during the many years he spent in Cooperstown. 
A few years after his death it was destroyed by fire. Its 
sitg is now a village park.

THO astonished at first by the uproar, Heyward 
was soon enabled to find its solution by the 
scene that followed. There yet lingered sufficient 
light in the heavens to exhibit those bright open- 
ings among the treetops where different paths 
left the clearing to enter the depths of the wilder- 
ness. Beneath one of them, a line of warriors 
issued from the woods and advanced slowly to- 
ward the dwellings. One in front bore a short 
pole, on which, as it afterward appeared, were 
suspended several human scalps. The startling 
sounds that Duncan had heard were what the 
whites have not inappropriately called the 
‘*death-hallo’’; and each repetition of the ¢ 
was intended to announce to the tribe the fate 
of an enemy. Thus far the knowledge of Hey- 
ward assisted him in the explanation; and as 
he knew that the interruption was caused by 
the unlooked-for return of a successful war-party, 
every disagreeable sensation was quieted in in. 
ward congratulations for the opportune relief 
and insignificance it conferred on himself. 
When at the distance of a few hundred feet 
from the lodges, the newly arrived warriors halt- 
ed. The plaintive and terrifie ery which was 
intended to represent equally the wailings of 
the dead and the triumph of the victors, had 
entirely ceased. One of their number now ealled 
aloud, in words that were far from appalling, 
‘From Chapter XXIII of “The Last of the Mohicans.” 
178

  JAMES FENIMORE COOPER 
  tho not more intelligible to those for whose ears 
they were intended than their expressive yells. 
It would be difficult to convey a suitable idea of 
the savage ecstasy with which the news thus 
imparted was received. The whole encampment 
in a moment became a scene of the most violent 
bustle and commotion. The warriors drew their 
knives, and flourishing them, they arranged them- 
selves in two lines, forming a lane that extended 
from the war-party to the lodges. The squaws 
seized clubs, axes, or whatever weapons of offense 
first offered itself to their hands, and rushed 
eagerly to act their part in the cruel game that 
was at hand. Even the children would not be 
excluded; but boys, little able to wield the in- 
struments, tore the tomahawks from the belts of 
their fathers, and stole into the ranks, apt imita- 
tors of the savage traits exhibited by their 
parents. 
Large piles of brush lay scattered about the 
elearing, and a wary and aged squaw was occu- 
pied firmg as many as might serve to light the 
coming exhibition. As the flame arose, its power 
exceeded that of the parting day, and assisted 
to render objects at the same time more distinet 
and more hideous. The whole scene formed a 
striking pieture, whose frame was composed of 
the dark and tall border of pines. The warriors 
just arrived were the most distant figures. A 
little in advance stood two men, who were ap- 
parently selected from the rest as the principal 
actors in what was to follow. The light was not 
strong enough to render their features distinct, 
tho it was quite evident that they were governed 
by very different emotions. While one stood 
179
-P-A-G-E-193
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  erect and firm, prepared to meet his fate like 
a hero, the other bowed his head, as if palsied 
by terror or stricken with shame. 
The high-spirited Duncan felt a powerful im- 
pulse of admiration and pity toward the former, 
tho no opportunity could offer to exhibit his 
generous emotions. He watched his slightest 
movement, however, with eager eyes; and as he 
traced the fine outline of his admirably propor- 
tioned and active frame, he endeavored to per- 
suade himself that if the powers of man, sec- 
onded by such noble resolution, could bear one 
harmless through so severe a trial, the youthful 
eaptive before him might hope for success in 
the hazardous race he was about to run. In- 
sensibly the young man drew nigher to the swar- 
thy lines of the Hurons, and scarcely breathed, 
so intense became his interest in the spectacle. 
Just then the signal yell was given, and the 
momentary quiet which had preceded it was 
broken by a burst of cries that far exceeded 
any before heard. The most abject of the two 
victims continued motionless; but the other 
pounded from the place at the ery, with the 
activity and the swiftness of a deer. Instead 
of rushing through the hostile lines as had been 
expected, he just entered the dangerous defile, 
and before time was given for a single blow, 
turned short, and leaping the heads of a row 
of children, he gained at once the exterior and 
safer side of the formidable array. The artifice 
was answered by a hundred voices raised in 
impreeations, and the whole of the excited mul- 
titude broke from their order and spread them- 
selves about the place in wild confusion.

————————— ee 
A dozen blazing piles now shed their lurid 
brightness on the place, which resembled some 
unhallowed and supernatural arena in which 
malicious demons had assembled to act their 
bloody and lawless rites. The forms in the 
background looked like unearthly beings gliding 
before the eye and cleaving the air with frantic 
and unmeaning gestures; while the savage pas- 
sions of such as passed the flames were rendered 
fearfully distinct by the gleams that shot athwart 
their inflamed visages. 
It will easily be understood that amid such 
a concourse of vindictive enemies no breathing- 
time was allowed the fugitive. There was a 
single moment when it seemed as if he would 
have reached the forest; but the whole body of 
his captors threw themselves before him, and 
drove him back into the center of his relentless 
persecutors. Turning like a headed deer, he shot 
with the swiftness of an arrow through a pillar 
of forked flame, and passing the whole multitude 
harmless he appeared on the opposite side of 
the clearing. Here, too, he was met and turned 
by a few of the older and more subtle of the 
Hurons. Once more he tried the throng, as if 
seeking safety in its blindness; and then several 
moments sueceeded, during which Duncan be- 
lieved the active and courageous young stranger 
was lost. 
Nothing could be distinguished but a dark 
mass of human forms tossed and involved in 
inexplicable confusion. Arms, gleaming knives, 
and formidable clubs appeared above them, but 
the blows were evidently given at random. The 
awful effect was heightened by the piercing 
181
-P-A-G-E-195
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  shrieks of the women and the fierce yells of the 
warriors. Now and then Duncan caught a 
glimpse of a light form cleaving the air in some 
desperate bound, and he rather hoped than be- 
lieved that the captive yet retained the command 
of his astonishing powers of activity. Suddenly 
the multitude rolled backward, and approached 
the spot where he himself stood. The heavy body 
in the rear prest upon the women and children 
in front, and bore them to the earth. The 
stranger reappeared in the confusion. Human 
power could not, however, much longer endure 
so severe a trial . . . 
There was no term of abuse known to the 
Huron vocabulary that the disappointed women 
did not lavishly expend on the successful 
stranger. They flouted at his efforts, and told 
him with bitter scoffs that his feet were better 
than his hands, and that he merited wings, while 
he knew not the use of an arrow or a knife. To 
all this the captive made no reply, but was con- 
tent to preserve an attitude in which dignity was 
singularly blended with disdain. Exasperated as 
much by his composure as by his good fortune, 
their words became unintelligible, and were sue- 
ceeded by shrill piercing yells. Just then the 
erafty squaw who had taken the necessary pre- 
cautions to fire the piles made her way through 
the throng, and cleared a place for herself in 
front of the captive. The squalid and withered 
person of this hag might well have obtained for 
her the character of possessing more than human 
eunning. Throwing back her light vestment, she 
stretched forth her long skinny arm in derision, 
and using the language of the Lenape, as more 
182
-P-A-G-E-196

  intelligible to the subject of her gibes, she com- 
menced aloud: 
‘‘Look you, Delaware,’’ she said, snapping her 
fingers in his face, ‘‘your nation is a race of 
women, and the hoe is better fitted to your hands 
than the gun. Your squaws are the mothers of 
deer; but if a bear or a wild cat or a serpent 
were born among you, ye would flee. The Huron 
girls shall make you petticoats, and we will find 
you a husband.’’ 
A burst of savage laughter succeeded this at~ 
tack, during which the soft and musical merri- 
ment of the younger females strangely chimed 
with the cracked voice of their older and more 
malignant companion. But the stranger was 
superior to all their efforts. His head was im- 
movable, nor did he betray the slightest con- 
sciousness that any were present, except when 
his haughty eyes rolled toward the dusky forms 
of the warriors who stalked in the background, 
silent and sullen observers of the scene. 
Infuriated at the self-command of the captive, 
the woman placed her arms akimbo, and throw- 
ing herself into a posture of defiance she broke 
out anew, in a torrent of words that no art 
of ours could commit successfully to paper. Her 
breath was, however, expended in vain; for, al- 
tho distinguished in her nation as a proficient in 
the art of abuse, she was permitted to work 
herself into such a fury as actually to foam at 
the mouth, without causing a muscle to vibrate 
in the motionless figure of the stranger. The 
effect of his indifference began to extend itself 
to the other spectators, and a youngster who 
was just quitting the condition of a boy to enter 
183
-P-A-G-E-197
  
THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  the state of manhood, attempted to assist the 
termagant by flourishing his tomahawk before 
their victim and adding his empty boasts to the 
taunts of the woman. Then, indeed, the captive 
turned his face toward the light, and looked down 
on the stripling with an expression that was 
superior to contempt. At the next moment he 
resumed his quiet and reclining attitude against 
the post. But the change of posture had per- 
mitted Duncan to exchange glances with the 
firm and piercing eyes of Uneas. 
Breathless with amazement, and heavily op- 
prest with the critical situation of his friend, 
Heyward recoiled before the look, trembling lest 
its meaning might in some unknown manner 
hasten the prisoner’s fate. There was not, how- 
ever, any instant cause for such an apprehen- 
sion. Just then a warrior forced his way into 
the exasperated crowd. Motioning the women 
and children aside with a stern gesture, he took 
Uneas by the arm and led him toward the door 
of the council lodge. Thither all the chiefs and 
most of the distinguished warriors followed, 
among whom the anxious Heyward found means 
to enter without attracting any dangerous at- 
tention to himself. 
A few minutes were consumed in disposing 
of those present in a manner suitable to their 
rank and influence in the tribe. An order very 
similar to that adopted in the preceding inter- 
view was observed, the aged and superior chiefs 
occupying the area of the spacious apartment, 
within the powerful light of a glaring torch, 
while their juniors and inferiors were arranged 
in the background, presenting a dark outline of 
184

  JAMES FENIMORE COOPER 
  swarthy and marked visages. In the very center 
of the lodge, immediately under an opening that 
admitted the twinkling light of one or two stars, 
stood Uneas, calm, elevated, and collected. His 
high and haughty carriage was not lost on his 
captors, who often bent their looks on his person 
with eyes which, while they lost none of their 
inflexibility of purpose, plainly betrayed their 
admiration of the stranger’s daring.

LEATHER-STOCKING’S FAREWELL" 
EvpineHam and Elizabeth were surprized at 
the manner of the Leather-Stocking, which was 
unusually impressive and solemn; but, attributing 
it to the seene, the young man turned to the 
monument, and read aloud: 
“Sacred to the memory of Oliver Effingham, 
Esquire, formerly a major in his B. Majesty’s 
60th Foot; a soldier of tried valor; a subject of 
chivalrous loyalty; and a man of honesty. To 
these virtues he added the graces of a Christian. 
7From Chapter XLI of “The Pioneers.” Leather-Stocking 
was a name given by Cooper to his character Natty Bumppo, 
who, also, in various works, bore the name of Hawkeye, Path- 
finder and Deerslayer. Leather-Stocking appears in five of 
Cooper’s books, which are commonly and collectively known 
as “the Leather-Stocking Tales." He has generally been 
aceepted as & type of the hardy frontiersman who, in the 
years following the Revolution, carried civilization westward.

The morning of his life was spent in honor, 
wealth, and power; but its evening was obscured 
by poverty, neglect, and disease, which were al- 
leviated only by the tender care of his old, faith- 
ful, and upright friend and attendant, Nathaniel 
Bumppo. His descendants rear this stone to the 
virtues of the master, and to the enduring grati- 
tude of the servant.’’ 
The Leather-Stocking stared at the sound of 
his own name, and a smile of joy illumined 
his wrinkled features as he said: 
‘fAnd did ye say it, lad? have you then got 
the old man’s name eut in the stone by the side 
of his master’s? God bless ye, children! ’twas 
a kind thought, and kindness goes to the heart 
as life shortens.’’ 
Elizabeth turned her back to the speakers. 
Effingham made a fruitless effort before he suc- 
ceeded in saying: 
“Tt is there cut in plain marble; but it should 
have been written in letters of gold!’’ 
‘‘Show me the name, boy,’’ said Natty, with 
simple eagerness; ‘‘let me see my own name 
placed in such honor. ‘Tis a gin’rous gift to a 
man who leaves none of his name and family 
behind him, in a country where he has tarried 
so long.’’ 
Effingham guided his finger to the spot, and 
Natty followed the windings of the letters to the 
end with deep interest, when.he raised himself 
from the tomb, and said: 
“I suppose it’s all right; and it’s kindly 
thought, and kindly done! But what have ye 
put over the redskin?’’

**Mohican; ‘and Chingagook’ ’’— 
‘Gach, boy; ’gach-gook; Chingachgook, which, 
intarpreted, means Big Sarpent. The name 
should be set down right, for an Indian’s name 
has always some meaning in it.’’ 
*¢T will see it altered. ‘He was the last of his 
people who continued to inhabit this country; 
and it may be said of him that his faults were 
those of an Indian, and his virtues those of a 
man,’ ’? 
“You never said truer word, Mr. Oliver; ah’s 
me! if you had knowed him as I did, in his prime, 
in that very battle where the old gentleman, who 
sleeps by his side, saved his life, when them thieves, 
the Iroquois, had him at the stake, you’d have 
said all that, and more too. I eut the thongs 
with this very hand, and gave him my own toma- 
hawk and knife, seeing that the rifle was always 
my fav’rite weapon. He did Jay about him like 
aman! I met him as I was coming home from 
the trail, with eleven Mingo scalps on his pole. 
You needn’t shudder, Madam Effingham, for they 
was all from shaved heads and warriors. When 
I look about me, at these hills, where I used to 
eount sometimes twenty smokes, curling over the 
tree-tops, from the Delaware camps, it raises 
mournful thoughts, to think that not a redskin 
is left of them all; unless it be a drunken vaga- 
bond from the Oneidas, or them Yankee Indians,

8 The Leather-Stocking, who had imbibed, un- 
consciously, many of the Indian qualities, tho 
he always thought of himself as of a civilized 
being, compared with even the Delawares, averted 
his face to conceal the workings of his muscles, 
as he stooped to lift a large pack from behind 
the tomb, which he placed deliberately on his 
shoulders. 
“Gol? exclaimed Elizabeth, approaching him 
with a hurried step; ‘‘you should not venture 
so far in the woods alone, at your time of life,

Effingham, on some distant hunting.’’ 
‘What Mrs. Effingham tells you is true, Leath-

so I got aside to look at the graves by myself,

Major gave me, when we first parted in the 
woods, ye wouldn’t take it unkind, but would 
know that, let the old man’s body go where

exclaimed the youth; ‘‘where is it, Natty, that 
you purpose going?’’ 
The hunter drew nigh him with a confident, 
reasoning air, as if what he had to say would 
silence all objections, and replied: 
‘Why, lad, they tell me that on the Big Lakes 
there’s the best of hunting, and a great range, 
without a white man on it, unless it may be one 
like myself. I’m weary of living in clearings, 
and where the hammer is sounding in my ears 
from sunrise to sundown. And tho I’m much 
bound to ye both, children—I wouldn’t say it 
if it was not true—I crave to go into the woods 
ag’in, I do.’’ 
‘Woods!’ echoed Elizabeth, trembling with 
her feelings; ‘‘do you not call these endless 
forests woods?’ 
‘Ah! child, these be nothing to a man that’s 
used to the wilderness. I have took but little 
eomfort sin’ your father come on with his set- 
tlers; but I wouldn’t go far, while the life was 
in the body that lies under the sod there. But 
now he’s gone, and Chingachgook is gone; and 
you be both young and happy. Yes! the big 
house has rung with merriment this month past! 
And now, I thought, was the time to try to get a 
little comfort in the close of my days. Woods!

  indeed! I doesn’t call these woods, Madam Effing- 
ham, where I lose myself every day of my life in 
the clearings.’’ 
“Tf there be anything wanting to your com- 
fort, name it, Leather-Stocking; if it be attain- 
able it is yours.’’ 
‘You mean all for the best, lad; I know it; 
and so does Madam, too: but your ways isn’t 
my ways. ’Tis like the dead there, who thonght, 
when the breath was in them, that one went east, 
and one went west to find their heavens; but 
they’ll meet at last; and so shall we, children. 
Yes, ind as you’ve begun, and we shall meet in 
the land of the just at last.’’ 
“This is so new! so unexpected!’’ said Eliza- 
beth, in almost breathless excitement; ‘“‘I had 
thought you meant to live with us and die with us, 
Natty.’ 
‘*Words are of no avail,’’ exclaimed her hus- 
band; ‘‘the habits of forty years are not to be 
dispossest by the ties of a day. I know you 
too well to urge you further, Natty; unless you 
will let me build you a but on one of the dis- 
tant hills, where we can sometimes see you, and 
know that you are comfortable.’’ 
“Don’t fear for the Leather-Stoeking, chil- 
dren; God will see that his days be provided 
for, and his ind happy. I know you mean all 
for the best, but our ways doesn’t agree. I love 
the woods, and ye relish the face of man; I 
eat when hungry, and drink when a-dry; and

use, and I’m formed for the wilderness; if ye 
love me, let me go where my soul craves to be 
ag?in!?? 
The appeal was decisive; and not another word 
of entreaty for him to remain was then uttered; 
but Elizabeth bent her head to her bosom and 
wept, while her husband dashed away the tears 
from his eyes; and, with hands that almost re- 
fused to perform their office, he produced his 
pocketbook, and extended a parcel of bank- 
notes to the hunter. 
‘“‘Take these,’’ he said, ‘‘at least take these; 
secure them about your person, and in the hour 
of need they will do you good service.’’ 
The old man took the notes, and examined 
them with a curious eye. 
‘“‘This, then, is some of the new-fashioned 
money that they’ve been making at Albany, out 
of paper! It can’t be worth much to they that 
hasn’t Warning! No, no, lad—take back the 
stuff; it will do me no sarvice. I took kear to 
get all the Frenchman’s powder afore he broke 
up, and they say lead grows where I’m going. 
Tt isn’t even fit for wads, seeing that I use none 
but leather!. Madam Effingham, let an old man 
kiss your hand, and wish God’s choicest blessings 
on you and your’n.’’ 
“Once more let me beseech you, stay!’’ eried 
Elizabeth. ‘‘Do not, Leather-Stocking, leave me 
to grieve for the man who has twice reseued me 
from death, and who has served those I love so 
faithfully. For my sake, if not for your own, 
stay. I shall see you in those frightful dreams 
that still haunt my nights, dying in poverty and 
age, by the side of those terrific beasts you slew.

  There will be no evil that sickness, want, and 
solitude can inflict that my fancy will not con- 
jure as your fate. Stay with us, old man, if 
not for your own sake, at least for ours.’’ 
“‘Such thoughts and bitter dreams, Madam. 
Effingham,’’ returned the hunter, solemnly, ‘‘ will 
never haunt an‘ innocent parson long. They’ll 
pass away with God’s pleasure. And if the 
eatamounts be yet brought to your eyes in sleep, 
tis not for my sake, but to show you the power 
of Him that led me there to save you. Trust in 
God, madam, and your honorable husband, and 
the thoughts for an old man like me can never 
be long nor bitter. I pray that the Lord will 
keep you in mind—the Lord that lives in clear- 
ings as well as in the wilderness—and bless you, 
and all that belong to you, from this time till 
the great day when the whites shall meet the 
redskins in judgment, and justice shall be the 
law, and not power.’’ 
Elizabeth raised her head, and offered her col- 
orless cheek to his salute, when he lifted his 
eap and touched it respectfully. His hand was 
grasped with convulsive fervor by the youth, 
who continued silent. The hunter prepared him- 
self for his journey, drawing his belt tighter, 
and wasting his moments in the little reluctant 
movements of a sorrowful departure. Onee or 
twice he essayed to speak, but a rising in his 
throat prevented it. At length he shouldered 
his rifle, and eried with a clear huntsman’s call 
that echoed through the woods: 
‘*Fle-e-e-re, he-e-e-re, pups—away, dogs, away; 
ye’ll be footsore afore ye see the ind of the 
journey!”’

  The hounds leapt from the earth at this ery, 
and scenting around the graves and the silent 
pair, as if conscious of their own destination, 
they followed humbly at the heels of their mas- 
ter. A short pause succeeded, during which even 
the youth concealed his face on his grandfather’s 
tomb. When the pride of manhood, however, had 
supprest the feelings of nature, he turned to 
renew his entreaties, but saw that the cemetery 
was occupied only by himself and his wife. 
‘He is gone!’’ cried Effingham. 
Elizabeth raised her face, and saw the old 
hunter standing, looking back for a moment, on 
the verge of the wood. As he caught their 
glances, he drew his hard hand hastily across 
his eyes again, waved it on high for an adieu, 
and uttering a forced ery to his dogs, who were 
erouching at his feet, he entered the forest. 
This was the last that they ever saw of the 
Leather-Stocking, whose rapid movements pre- 
ceded the pursuit which Judge Temple both or- 
dered and conducted. He had gone far toward 
the setting sun—the foremost in that band of 
pioneers who are opening the way for the march 
of the nation across the continent.

AN OCTOBER DAY IN FLORENCE* 
Waxep by the jangling of all the bells in 
Florence and by the noise of carriages departing 
loaded with travelers for Rome and other places 
in the south of Italy, I rise, dress myself, and 
take my place at the window. I see crowds of 
men and women from the country, the former in 
brown velvet jackets, and the latter in broad- 
brimmed straw hats, driving donkeys loaded with 
panniers or trundling handearts before them, 
heaped with grapes, figs and all the fruits of the 
orchard, the garden, and the field. They have 
hardly passed when large flocks of sheep and 
goats make their appearance, attended by shep- 
herds and their families, driven by the approach

  of winter from the Apenines, and seeking the 
pastures of the Maremma, a rich, but, in the 
summer, an unhealthy tract on the coast. The 
men and boys are drest in knee-breeches, the 
women in bodices, and both sexes wear capotes 
with pointed hoods, and felt hats with conical 
erowns; they carry long staves in their hands, 
and their arms are loaded with kids and lambs 
too young to keep pace with their mothers. 
After the long procession of sheep and goats and 
dogs and men and women and children, come horses 
loaded with cloths and poles for tents, kitchen 
utensils, and the rest of the younglings of the 
flock. A little after sunrise I see well-fed don- 
keys, in coverings of red cloth, driven over the 
bridge to be milked for invalids. Maid-servants, 
bareheaded, with huge, high-carved combs in their 
hair, waiters of coffee-houses carrying the morning 
cup of coffee or chocolate to their customers, 
bakers’ boys with a dozen loaves on a board 
balanced on their heads, milkmen with rush 
baskets filled with flasks of milk are crossing the 
streets in all directions. A little later the bell 
of the small chapel opposite to my window rings 
furiously for a quarter of an hour, and then I 
hear mass chanted in a deep strong nasal tone. 
As the day advances, the English, in white hats 
and white pantaloons, come out of their lodgings, 
accompanied sometimes by their hale and square- 
built spouses, and saunter stiffly along the Arno, 
or take their way to the public galleries and 
museums. ‘Their massive, clean, and brightly 
polished carriages also begin to rattle through the 
streets, setting out on excursions to some part 
of the environs of Florence—to Fiesole, to the

  Pratolino, to the Bello Sguardo, to the Poggio 
Imperiale. 
Sights of a different kind now present them- 
selves. Sometimes it is a troop of stout Fran- 
eciscan friars, in sandals and brown robes, each 
earrying his staff and wearing a brown, broad- 
brimmed hat with a hemispherical crown. Some- 
times it is a band of young theological students, 
in purple cassocks with red collars and cuffs, 
let out on a holiday, attended by their clerical 
instructors, to ramble in the Cascine. There is 
a priest coming over the bridge, a man of ven- 
erable age and great reputation for sanctity. 
The common people crowd around him to kiss 
his hand, and obtain a kind word from him as 
he passes. But what is that procession of men 
in black gowns, black gaiters, and black masks 
moving swiftly along, and bearing on their shoul- 
ders a litter covered with black cloth? These are 
the Brethren of Mercy, who have assembled at 
the sound of the cathedral bell, and are conveying 
some sick or wounded person to the hospital. 
As the day begins to decline, the number of 
carriages in the streets, filled with gaily drest 
people attended by servants in livery, increases, 
The Grand Duke’s equipage, an elegant carriage 
drawn by six horses, with coachmen, footmen, 
and outriders'in drab-colored livery, comes from 
the Pitti Palace, and crosses the Arno, either by 
the bridge close to my lodgings, or by that called 
Alla Santa Trinita, which is in full sight from 
the windows. The Florentine nobility, with their 
families, and the English residents now throng 
to the Cascine, to drive at a slow pace through 
its thickly planted walks of elms, oaks and ilexes,

  As the sun is sinking I perceive the quay on the 
other side of the Arno filled with a moving erowd 
of well-drest people walking to and fro and 
enjoying the beauty of the evening. 
Travelers now arrive from all quarters, in 
cabriolets, in calashes, in the shabby vettura, 
and in the elegant private carriage drawn by 
post-horses, and driven by postilions in the tight- 
est possible deerskin breeches, the smallest red 
coats, and the hugest jack-boots. The streets 
about the doors of the hotels resound with the 
erackling of whips and the stamping of horses, 
and are encumbered with carriages, heaps of bag- 
gage, porters, postilions, couriers, and travelers, 
Night at length arrives—the time of spectacles 
and funerals. The carriages rattle toward the 
opera-houses. Trains of people, sometimes in 
white robes and sometimes in black, carrying 
blazing torches and a cross elevated on a high 
pole before a coffin, pass through the streets 
ehanting the service for the dead. The Brethren 
of Merey may also be seen engaged in their office. 
The rapidity of their pace, the flare of their 
torches, the gleam of their eyes through their 
masks, and their sable garb, give them a kind 
of supernatural appearance. I return to bed 
and fall asleep amidst the shouts of people re- 
turning from the opera, singing as they go 
snatches of the music with which they had been 
entertained during the evening.

THE FATE OF EGMONT AND HOORNE?* 
On the second of June, 1568, a body of three 
thousand men was ordered to Ghent to escort the 
Counts Egmont and Hoorne to Brussels. No 
resistance was offered, altho the presence of the 
Spaniards caused a great sensation among the 
inhabitants of the place, who too well foreboded 
the fate of their beloved lord. 
The nobles, each accompanied by two officers, 
were put into separate chariots. They were 
guarded by twenty companies of pikemen and 
arquebusiers; and a detachment of lancers, 
among whom was a body of the duke’s own horse, 
rode in the van, while another of equal strength 
protected the rear. Under this strong escort they 
moved slowly toward Brussels. One night they 
. halted at Dendermonde, and toward evening, on

of Philip II, King of Spain.”

the fourth of the month, entered the capital. As 
the martial array defiled through its streets, there 
was no one, however stout-hearted he might be, 
says an eye-witness, who vould behold the funeral 
pomp of the procession, and listen to the strains 
of melancholy musie without a feeling of sick- 
ness at his heart. 
The prisoners were at ouee conducted to the 
Brod-huys, or ‘‘Bread-house,’’ usually known as 
the Maison du Roi—that venerable pile in the 
market-place of Brussels, still visited by every 
traveler for its curious architecture, and yet more 
as the last resting-place of the Flemish lords. 
Here they were lodged in separate rooms, small, 
dark, and uncomfortable, and soantily rovided 
with furniture. Nearly the ‘whole! of ‘the foree 
which had escorted themsto Brussels was estab- 
lished in the great square, to defeat any attempt 
at a rescue. But none was.made; and the night 
passed away without, distadibance, except what, 
was occasioned by the sound ‘6f/busy worknien , 
employed in construeting a scaffold for, the scene ; 
of execution on the following day. : é . 
On the afternoon ofthe fourth, the Duke of 
Alva? had sent for Martin Rithovius, bishop of 
Ypres; and, communicating to him the sentence 
of the nobles, he requested the prelate to visit 
the prisoners, acquaint them with their fate, and 
prepare them for their execution on the following 
day. The bishop, an excellent man, and the per-

ernor in 1567 where, as an instrument of his cruelty, he 
established what is known as “The Council of Blood,” a 
court of inquiry and persecution which, in the course of 
three months, put to death 1,660 persons.

  sonal friend of Egmont, was astounded by the 
tidings. He threw himself at Alva’s feet, im- 
ploring merey for the prisoners, and if he could 
not spare their lives, beseeching him at least to 
grant them more time for preparation. But Alva 
sternly rebuked the prelate, saying that he had 
been summoned not to thwart the execution of 
the law, but to console the prisoners and enable 
them to die like Christians. The bishop, finding 
his entreaties useless, rose and addrest himself 
to his melancholy mission. 
It was near midnight when he entered Eg- 
mont’s apartment, where he found the poor 
nobleman, whose strength had been already re- 
duced: by, oq nement, and who was wearied by 
the fati de | sf the journey, buried in slumber. 
Tt ag) said that the two lords, when summoned 
to Brussels, had indulged the vain hope that it 
was to inform them of the conclusion of their 
trial and their acquittal! However this may be, 
Egmont seems ‘to have been but ill prepared for 
the dread fa ‘tidings he received. He turned 
deadly\pale as he listened to the bishop, and 
exclaimed, with deep emotion, ‘‘It is a terrible 
sentence. Little did I imagine that any offense 
I had committed against God or the king could 
merit such punishment. It is not death that I 
fear. Death is the common lot of all. But I 
shrink from dishonor. Yet I may hope that 
my sufferings will so far expiate my offenses 
that my innocent family will not be involved in 
my ruin by the confiscation of my property. This 
much, at least, I think I may claim in considera- 
tion of my past services.’’ Then, after a pause, 
he added, ‘‘Since my death is the will of God

and his Majesty, I will try to meet it with pa- 
tience.’? He asked the bishop if there were no 
hope. On being answered, ‘‘None whatever,’’ 
he resolved to devote himself at once to pre- 
paring for the solemn change. 
He rose from his couch, and hastily drest him- 
self. He then made his confession to the prelate, 
and desired that mass might be said, and the 
sacrament administered to him. This was done 
with great solemnity, and Egmont received the 
communion in the most devout manner, mani- 
festing the greatest contrition for his sins. He 
next inquired of the bishop to what prayer he 
could best have recourse to sustain him in this 
trying hour. The prelate recommended to him 
that prayer which our Savior had commended 
to his disciples. The advice pleased the count, 
who earnestly engaged in his devotions. But a 
host of tender recollections crowded on his mind, 
and the images of his wife and children drew 
his thoughts in another direction, till the kind 
expostulations of the prelate again restored him 
to himse?f, 
Egmont asked whether it would be well to say 
anything on the seaffold for the edification of 
the people. But the bishop discouraged him, 
saying that he would be imperfectly heard, and 
that the people, in their present excitement, 
would be apt to misinterpret what he said to 
their own prejudice. 
Having attended to his spiritual concerns, 
Egmont ealled for writing materials, and wrote 
a letter to his wife, whom he had not seen during 
his long confinement; and to her he now bade a 
tender farewell. He then addrest another letter, 
201
-P-A-G-E-215
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  written in French, in a few brief and touching 
sentences, to the King—which fortunately has 
been preserved to us. ‘This morning,’’ he says, 
‘*T have been made acquainted with the sentence 
which it has pleased your majesty to pass upon 
me. And altho it has never been my intent to 
do aught against the person or the service of 
your majesty, or against our true, ancient, and 
Catholic faith, yet I receive in patience what it 
has pleased God to send me. If during these 
troubles I have counseled or permitted aught 
which might seem otherwise, I have done so from 
a sincere regard for the service of God and your 
majesty, and from what I believed the necessity 
of the times. Wherefore I pray your majesty 
to pardon it, and for the sake of my past services 
to take pity on my poor wife, my children, and 
my servants. In this trust I commend myself 
to the merey of God.’’ The letter is dated Brus- 
sels, ‘‘on the point of death,’’ June 5th, 1568. 
Having time still left, the count made a fair 
copy of the two letters, and gave them to the 
bishop, entreating him to deliver them according 
to their destination. He accompanied, that to 
Philip with a ring, to be given at the same time to 
the monarch. It was of great value, and, as it 
had been the gift of Philip himself during the 
count’s Jate visit to Madrid, it might soften the 
heart of the King by reminding him of happier 
days, when he had looked with an eye of favor 
on his unhappy vassal. 
Having completed all his arrangements, Hg- 
mont became impatient for the hour of his 
departure; and he exprest the hope that there 
would be no unnecessary delay. At ten in the

morning the soldiers appeared who were to con- 
duet him to the scaffold. They brought with them 
cords, as usual, to bind the prisoner’s hands. 
But Egmont remonstrated, and: showed that he 
had himself eut off the collar of his doublet and 
shirt, in order to facilitate the stroke of the 
executioner. This he did to convince them that 
he meditated no resistance; and on his promising 
that he would attempt none, they consented to 
his remaining with his hands unbound. 
Egmont was drest in a erimson damask robe, 
over which was a Spanish mantle fringed with 
gold. His breeches were of black silk, and 
his hat, of the same material, was garnished with 
white and sable plumes. In his hand, which, as 
we have seen, remained free, he held a white 
handkerchief. On his way to the place of ex- 
ecution he was accompanied by Julian de Ro- 
mero, maitre de camp, by the captain, Salinas, 
who had charge of the fortress of Ghent, and 
by the bishop of Ypres. As the procession moved 
slowly forward, the count repeated some portion 
of the fifty-first Psalm—‘‘Have merey on me, 
O God!?’—in which the good prelate joined with 
him. In the center of the square, on the spot 
where so much of the best blood of the Nether- 
lands had been shed, stood the scaffold, covered 
with black cloth. On it were two velvet cushions 
with a small table, shrouded likewise in black, 
and supporting a silver erucifix. At the corners 
of the platform were two poles, pointed at the 
end with steel, intimating the purpose for which 
they were intended. 
In front of the seaffold was the provost of 
the eourt, mounted on horseback, and bearing 
203
-P-A-G-E-217

  the red wand of office in his hand. The execu- 
tioner remained, as usual, below the platform, 
sereened from view, that he might not, by his 
presence before it was necessary, outrage the 
feelings of the prisoners. The troops, who had 
been under arms all night, were drawn up around 
in order of battle; and strong bodies of arque- 
busiers. were posted in the great avenues which 
led to the square. The space left open by the 
soldiery was speedily oceupied by a crowd of 
eager spectators. Others thronged the roofs and 
windows of the buildings that surrounded the 
market-place, some of which, still standing at 
the present day, show, by their quaint and ven- 
erable architecture, that they must have looked 
down on the tragic scene we are now depicting. 
It was indeed a gloomy day for Brussels—so 
Jong the residenee of the two nobles, where 
their forms were as familiar and where they 
were held in as much love and honor as in 
any of their own provinces. All business 
was suspended. The shops were closed. The 
bells tolled in all the churches. An air of 
gloom, as of some impending calamity, settled 
on the city. ‘‘It seemed,’’ says one residing 
there at the time, ‘‘as if the day of judgment 
were at hand!’’ 
As the procession slowly passed through the 
ranks of the soldiers, Egmont saluted the officers 
—some of them his ancient companions—with 
such a sweet and dignified composure in his man- 
ner as was long remembered by those who saw it. 
And few even of the Spaniards could refrain 
from tears as they took their last look at the 
gallant noble who was to perish so miserably.

With a steady step he mounted the scaffold, 
and, as he crossed it, gave utterance to the vain 
wish that, instead of meeting such a fate, he 
had been allowed to die in the service of his 
King and country. He quickly, however, turned 
to other thoughts, and, kneeling on one of the 
cushions, with the bishop beside him on the other, 
he was soon engaged earnestly in prayer. With 
his eyes raised toward heaven with a look of 
unutterable sadness, he prayed so fervently and 
loud as to be distinctly heard by the specta- 
tors. The prelate, much affected, put into his 
hands the silver crucifix, which Egmont repeated- 
ly kissed; after which, having received absolution 
for the last time, he rose and made a sign to the 
bishop to retire. He then stript off his mantle 
and robe; and, again kneeling, he drew a silk 
cap, which he had brought for the purpose, over 
his eyes, and, repeating the words, ‘‘Into Thy 
hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit,’’ he calmly 
awaited the stroke of the executioner. 
The low sounds of lamentation which from 
time to time had been heard among the populace 
were now hushed into silence as the minister 
of justice, appearing on the platform, approached 
his victim and with a single blow of the sword 
severed the head from the body. <A ery of horror 
rose from the multitude, and some, frantic with 
grief, broke through the ranks of the soldiers 
and wildly dipped their handkerchiefs in the 
blood that streamed from the scaffold, treasuring 
them up, says the chronicler, as precious memo- 
rials of love and incitements to vengeance. The 
head was then set on one of the poles at the 
end of the platform, while a mantle thrown over

the mutilated trunk hid it from the publie gaze. 
It was near noon when orders were sent to 
lead forth the remaining prisoner to execution. 
It had been assigned to the curate of La Chapelle 
to acquaint Count Hoorne with his fate. That 
nobleman received the awful tidings with less 
patience than was shown by his friend. He 
gave way to a burst of indignation at the cruelty 
and injustice of the sentence. It was a poor 
requital, he said, for eight-and-twenty years of 
faithful service to his sovereign. Yet, he added, 
he was not sorry to be released from a life of 
such incessant fatigue. For some time he refused 
to confess, saying he had done enough in the 
way of confession. When urged not to throw 
away the few precious moments that were left 
to him, he at length consented. 
The count was drest in a plain suit of black, 
and wore 2, Milanese cap upon his head. He was, 
at this time, about fifty years of age. He was 
tall, with handsome features, and altogether of 
& commanding presence. His form was erect, 
and as he passed with a steady step through the 
files of soldiers, on his way to the place of ex- 
ecution, he frankly saluted those of his acquaint- 
ance whom he saw among the spectators. His 
look had in it less of sorrow than of indignation, 
like that of one conscious of enduring wrong. 
He was spared one pang, in his last hour, which 
had filled Egmont’s eup with bitterness; tho, 
“like him, he had a wife, he was to leave no 
orphan family to mourn him. 
As he trod the scaffold, the apparatus of death 
seemed to have no power to move him. He still 
repeated the declaration that, ‘‘often as he had 
206

  offended his Maker, he had never, to his knowl- 
edge, committed any offense against the King.’’ 
When his eyes fell on the bloody shroud that 
enveloped the remains of Egmont, he inquired 
if it were the body of his friend. Being an- 
swered in the affirmative, he made some remark 
in Castilian, not understood. He then prayed 
for a few moments, but in so low a tone that 
the words were not caught by the bystanders, 
and, rising, he asked pardon of those around if 
he had ever offended any of them, and earnestly 
besought their prayers. Then, without further 
delay, he knelt down, and, repeating the words, 
“In manus tuas, Domine,’’ he submitted himself 
to his fate. 
His bloody head was set up opposite to that 
of his fellow sufferer. For three hours these 
ghastly trophies remained exposed to the gaze of 
the multitude. They were then taken down, 
and, with the bodies, placed in leaden coffins, 
which were straightway removed—that contain- 
ing the remains of Egmont to the convent of 
Santa Clara, and that of Hoorne to the ancient 
church of Ste. Gudule. To these places, espe- 
cially to Santa Clara, the people now flocked as 
to the shrine of a martyr. They threw themselves 
on the coffin, kissing it and bedewing it with 
their tears, as if it had eontained the relies of 
some murdered saint; while many of them, taking 
little heed of the presence of informers, breathed _ 
vows of vengeance, some even swearing not to 
trim either hair or beard till these vows were 
executed. The government seems to have thought 
it prudent to take no notice of this burst of 
popular feeling. But a funeral hatchment, bla-

  zoned with the arms of Egmont, which, as usual 
after the master’s death, had been fixt by his 
domestics on the gates of his mansion, was or- 
dered to be instantly removed—no doubt, as 
tending to keep alive the popular excitement. 
The bodies were not allowed to remain long in 
their temporary places of deposit, but were trans- 
ported to the family residences of the two lords 
in the country, and laid in the vaults of their 
ancestors. 
Thus by the hand of the common executioner 
perished these two unfortunate noblemen, who, 
by their rank, possessions, and personal charac- 
ters, were the most illustrious victims that could 
have been selected in the Netherlands. Both 
had early enjoyed the favor of Charles the Fifth, 
and both had been entrusted by Philip with some 
of the highest offices in the state. Philip de 
Montmoreney, Count Hoorne, the elder of the 
two, came of the ancient house of Montmorency 
in France. Besides filling the high post of Ad- 
miral of the Low Countries, he was made goy- 
ernor of the provinces of Guelders and Zutphen, 
was a councilor of state, and was created by the 
Emperor a knight of the Golden Fleece. His 
fortune was greatly inferior to that of Count 
Egmont; yet its eonfiseation afforded a supply 
by no means unwelcome to the needy exchequer 
of the Duke of Alva. 
However nearly on a footing they might be 
in many respects, Hoorne was altogether eclipsed 
by his friend in military renown.

THE GENESIS OF “DON QUIXOTE”* 
Tur age of chivalry, as depicted in romances, 
could never, of course, have had any real ex- 
istence; but the sentiments which are described 
ag animating that age have been found more’ 
or less operative in different countries and dif- 
ferent periods of society. In Spain, especially, 
this influence is to be diseerned from a very 
early date. Its inhabitants may be said to have 
lived in a romantic atmosphere, in which all the 
extravagances of chivalry were nourished by 
their peculiar situation. Their hostile relations 
with the Moslem kept alive the full glow of relig- 
ious and patriotic feeling. Their history is one 
interminable crusade. An enemy always on the 
borders invited perpetual displays of personal 
daring and adventure. The refinement and mag- 
nificence of the Spanish Arabs throw a luster 
over these contests such as eould not be reflected 
from the rude skirmishes with their Christian 
neighbors. Lofty sentiments, embellished by 
the softer refinements of courtesy, were blended 
in the martial bosom of the Spaniard, and Spain 
became emphatically the land of romantic chiv- 
alry. 
The very laws themselves, conceived in this

ican Review.

spirit, contributed greatly to foster it. The an- 
cient code of Alfonso X, in the thirteenth cen- 
tury, after many minute regulations for the de- 
portment of the good knight, enjoins on him to 
“‘invoke the name of his mistress in the fight, 
that it may infuse new ardor into his soul and 
preserve him from the commission of unknightly 
actions.’’ Such laws were not a dead letter. The 
history of Spain shows that the sentiment of 
romantic gallantry penetrated the nation more 
deeply and continued longer than in any other 
quarter of Christendom. 
The taste for these romantie extravagances 
naturally fostered a corresponding taste for the 
perusal of tales of chivalry. Indeed, they acted 
reciprocally on each other. These chimerical leg- 
ends had onee, also, beguiled the long evenings 
of our Norman ancestors, but, in the progress 
of civilization, had gradually given way to other 
and more natural forms of composition. They 
still maintained their ground in Italy, whither 
they had passed later, and where they were con- 
seerated by the hand of genius. But Italy was 
not the true soil of chivalry, and the inimitable 
fictions of Bojardo, Pulci, and Ariosto were com- 
posed with that lurking smile of half-supprest 
mirth which, far from a serious tone, could raise 
only a corresponding smile of incredulity in the 
reader. 
In Spain, however, the marvels of romance 
were all taken in perfect good faith. Not that 
they were received as literally true; but the 
reader surrendered himself up to the illusion, and 
was moved to admiration by the recital of deeds 
which, viewed in any other light than as a wild 
210
-P-A-G-E-224
  WILLIAM H. PRESCOTT 
  
frolie of imagination, would be supremely ridicu- 
lous; for these tales had not the merit of a 
seductive style and melodious versification to 
relieve them. They were, for the most part, an 
ill-digested mass of incongruities, ia which there 
was as little keeping and probability in the char- 
acters as in the incidents, while the whole was 
told in that stilted ‘‘Hercles’ vein’? and with 
that licentiousness of allusion and imagery which 
could not fail to debaueh both the taste and the 
morals of the youthful reader. The mind, famil- 
iarized with these monstrous, over-colored pic- 
tures, lost all relish for the chaste and sober 
productions of art. The love of the gigantie and 
the marvelous indisposed the reader for the simple 
delineations of truth in real history. 
Cervantes brought forward a personage, in 
whom were embodied all those generous virtues 
which belong to chivalry; disinterestedness, con- 
tempt of danger, unblemished honor, knightly 
courtesy, and those aspirations after ideal ex- 
eellence which, if empty dreams, are the dreams 
of a magnanimous spirit. They are, indeed, rep- 
resented by Cervantes as too ethereal for this 
world, and are successively dispelled as they come 
in contact with the coarse realities of life. It 
is this view of the subject which has led Sis- 
mondi, among other critics, to consider that the 
principal end of the author was ‘‘the ridicule 
of enthusiasm—the contrast of the heroie with 
the vulgar’’—and he sees something profoundly 
sad in the conclusions to which it leads. This 
sort of criticism appears to be over-refined. It 
resembles the efforts of some commentators to 
allegorize the great epics of Homer and Virgil, 
241
-P-A-G-E-225
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  throwing a disagreeable mistinesss over the story 
by converting mere shadows into substances, and 
substances into shadows. 
The great purpose of Cervantes was, doubtless, 
that expressly avowed by himself, namely, to 
correct the popular taste for romances of chiv- 
alry. It is unnecessary to look for any other 
in so plain a tale, altho, it is true, the conduct 
of the story produces impressions on the reader, 
to a certain extent, like those suggested by Sis- 
mondi. The melancholy tendency, however, is 
in a great degree counteracted by the exquisitely 
Indicrous character of the incidents. Perhaps, 
after all, if we are to hunt for a moral as the 
key of the fiction, we may with more reason 
pronounce it to be the necessity of proportioning 
our undertakings to our capacities. 
The mind of the hero, Don Quixote, is an ideal 
world into which Cervantes has poured all the 
rich stores of his own imagination, the poet’s 
golden dreams, high romantic exploit, and the 
sweet visions of pastoral happiness; the gorgeous 
chimeras of the fancied age of chivalry, which 
had so long entranced the world; splendid illu- 
sions, which, floating before us like the airy 
bubbles which the child throws off from his pipe, 
reflect, in a thousand variegated tints, the rude 
objects around, until, brought into collision with 
these, they are dashed in pieces and melt into 
air. These splendid images derive tenfold beauty 
from the rich antique coloring of the author’s 
language, skilfully imitated from the old ro- 
mances, but which necessarily escapes in the 
translation into a foreign tongue. Don Quixote’s 
insanity operates both in mistaking the ideal for 
212
-P-A-G-E-226
  WILLIAM H. PRESCOTT EE EEEEEeeT 
the real, and the real for the ideal. Whatever 
he has found in romances he believes to exist in 
the world; and he converts all he meets with in 
the world into the visions of his romances. It 
is difficult to say which of the two produces the 
most ludicrous resulis. 
For the better exposure of these mad fancies 
Cervantes has not only put them into action in 
real life, but contrasted them with another char- 
acter which may be said to form the reverse side 
of his hero’s. Honest Sancho represents the 
material principle as perfectly as his master does 
the intellectual or ideal. He is of the earth, 
earthy. Sly, selfish, sensual, his dreams are not 
of glory, but of good feeding. His only concern 
is for his carcass. His notions of honor appear 
to be much the same with those of his jovial 
contemporary Falstaff, as conveyed in his mem- 
orable soliloquy: In the sublime night-piece 
which ends with the fulling-mills—truly sublime 
until we reach the dénouement—Sancho asks his 
master: ‘‘Why need you go about this adven- 
ture? It is main dark, and there is never a living 
soul sees us; we have nothing to do but to sheer 
off and get out of harm’s way. Who is there 
to take notice of our flinching?’’ Can anything 
be imagined more exquisitely opposed to the 
true spirit of chivalry? The whole compass of 
fietion nowhere displays the power of contrast 
so forcibly as in these two characters; perfectly 
opposed to each other, not only in their minds 
and general habits, but in the minutest details 
of personal appearance. 
Tt was a great effort of art for Cervantes to 
maintain the dignity of his hero’s character in 
213
-P-A-G-E-227

  the midst of the whimsical and ridiculous dis- 
tresses in which he has perpetually involved him. 
His infirmity leads us to distinguish between his 
character and his conduct, and to absolve him 
from all responsibility for the latter. The au- 
thor’s art is no less shown in regard to the other 
principal figure in the piece, Sancho Panza, who, 
with the most contemptible qualities, contrives 
to keep a strong hold on our interest by the kind- 
ness of his nature and his shrewd understanding. 
He is far too shrewd a person, indeed, to make 
it natural for him to have followed so crack- 
brained a master unless bribed by the promise 
of a substantial recompense. He is a personifica- 
tion, as it were, of the popular wisdom—a ‘‘bun- 
dle of proverbs,’’ as his master somewhere styles 
him; and proverbs are the most eompact form 
in which the wisdom of a people is digested. 
They have been collected into several distinet 
works in Spain, where they exceed in number 
those of any other, if not every other country 
in Europe. As many of them are of great an- 
tiquity, they are of inestimable price with the 
Castilian jurists, as affording rich samples of 
obsolete idioms and the various mutations of the 
language. 
“Don Quixote’’ may be said to form an epoch 
in the history of letters, as the original of that 
kind of composition, the novel of character, 
which is one of the distinguishing peculiarities 
of modern literature. When well executed, this 
sort of writing rises to the dignity of history 
itself, and may be said to perform no insignificant 
part of the functions of the latter. History de- 
scribes men less as they are than as they appear,

as they are playing a part on the great political 
theater—men in masquerade. It rests on state 
documents, which too often cloak real purposes 
under an artful veil of policy, or on the accounts 
of contemporaries blinded by passion or interest. 
Even without these deductions, the revolutions of 
states, their wars, and their intrigues do not 
present the only aspect, nor, perhaps, the most 
interesting, under which human nature can be 
studied. It is man in his domestic relations, 
around his own fireside, where alone his real 
character can be truly disclosed; in his ordinary 
occupations in society, whether for purposes of 
profit or pleasure; in his every-day manner of 
living, his tastes and opinions, as drawn out in 
social intercourse; it is, in short, under all those 
forms which make up the interior of society that 
man is to be studied, if we would get the true 
form and pressure of the age—if, in short, we 
would obtain clear and correct ideas of the actual 
progress of civilization. 
But these topics do not fall within the scope 
of the historian. He can not find authentic mate- 
rials for them. They belong to the novelist, who, 
indeed, contrives his incidents and creates his 
characters, but who, if true to his art, animates 
them with the same tastes, sentiments, and mo- 
tives of action which belong to the period of 
his fiction. His portrait is not the less true 
because no individual has sat for it. He has 
seized the physiognomy of the times. Who is 
there that does not derive a more distinet idea 
of the state of society and manners in Scotland

manner, the pencil of Cervantes has given a far

in Spain in the sixteenth century than can be 
gathered from a library of monkish chronicles.

the departure ‘‘of the fleet and troops, the prov- 
ince would not be in a condition to drive them 
out.’? ‘Such a juncture as the present might 
never oceur’’; so he [the chief justice, Belcher] 
advised ‘‘against receiving any of the French 
inhabitants to take the oath,’’ and for the re- 
moval of ‘‘all’’ of them from the province. 
That the eruelty might have no palliation, let- 
ters arrived leaving no doubt that the shores 
of the Bay of Fundy were entirely in the pos- 
session of the British; and yet at a council, at 
which Vice-Admiral Boscawen and Rear-Admiral 
Mostyn were present by invitation, it was unan- 
imously determined to send the French in- 
habitants out of the province; and, after mature 
consideration, it was further unanimously agreed 
that, to prevent their attempting to return and 
molest: the settlers that were to be set down on 
their lands, it would be most proper to distribute 
them among the severa: colonies on the continent. 
To hunt them into the net was impracticable; 
artifice was therefore resorted to. By a general 
proclamation, on one and the same day, the 
seareely conscious victims, ‘‘both old men and 
young men, as well as all the lads of ten years 
of age,’? were peremptorily ordered to assemble 
at their respective posts. On the appointed fifth 
of September they obeyed. At Grand Pré, for 
example, four hundred and eighteen unarmed 
men came together. They were marched into 
the church and its avenues were closed, when 
Winslow, the American commander, placed him- 
self in their center, and spoke:

“You are convened together to manifest to 
you his majesty’s final resolution to the French 
inhabitants of this his province. Your lands 
and tenements, cattle of all kinds, and live stock 
of all sorts, are forfeited to the crown, and you 
yourselves are to be removed from this his prov- 
ince. I am, through his majesty’s goodness, di- 
rected to allow you liberty to carry off your 
money and household goods, as many as you can, 
without discommoding the vessels you go in.’’ 
And he then declared them the King’s prison- 
ers. Their wives and families shared their lot; 
their sons, five hundred and twenty-seven in 
number; their daughters, five hundred and seven- 
ty-six; in the whole, women and babes and old 
men and children all included, nineteen hundred 
and twenty-three souls. The blow was sudden; 
they had left home but for the morning, and they 
never were to return. Their cattle were to stay 
unfed in the stalls, their fires to die out on their 
hearths. They had for that first day even no 
food for themselves or their children, and were 
eompelled to beg for bread. 
The tenth of September was the day for the 
embarkation of a part of the exiles. They were 
drawn up six deep; and the young men, one 
hundred and sixty-one in number, were ordered 
to march first on board the vessel. They could 
leave their farms and cottages, the shady rocks 
on which they had reclined, their herds, and their 
garners; but nature yearned within them, and 
they would not be separated from their parents. 
Yet of what avail was the frenzied despair of 
the unarmed youth? They had not one weapon; 
the bayonet drove them to obey; and they

  marched slowly and heavily from the chapel to the 
shore, between women and children, who, kneel- 
ing, prayed for blessings on their heads, they 
themselves weeping and praying and singing 
hymns. The seniors went next; the wives and 
children must wait till other transport vessels 
arrive. The delay had its horrors. The wretched 
people left behind were kept together near the 
sea, without proper food, or raiment, or shelter, 
till other ships came to take them away; and 
December, with its appalling cold, had struck 
the shivering, half-clad, broken-hearted sufferers, 
before the last of them were removed. 
‘‘The embarkation of the inhabitants goes on 
but slowly,’’? wrote Monekton, from Fort Cum- 
berland, near which he had burned three ham- 
lets; ‘‘the most part of the wives of the men 
‘we have prisoners are gone off with their chil- 
dren, in hopes I would not send off their hus- 
bands without them.’’ heir hope was vain. 
Near Annapolis a hundred heads of families fled 
to the woods, and a party was detached on the 
hunt to bring them in. ‘‘Our soldiers hate 
them,’’ wrote an officer on this occasion; ‘‘and, 
if they can but find a pretext to kill them, they 
will.’? Did a prisoner seek to escape, he was 
shot down by the sentinel. Yet some fled to 
Quebec; more than three thousand had with- 
drawn to Miramachi and the region south of the 
Restigouche; some found rest on the banks of 
the St. John’s and its branches; some found a 
lair in their native forests; some were charitably 
sheltered from the English in the wigwams of 
the savages. But seven thousand of these ban- 
ished people were driven on board ships, and 
220

  seattered among the British colonies, from New 
Hampshire to Georgia—one thousand and twenty 
to South Carolina alone. They were cast ashore 
without resources, hating the poorhouse as a 
shelter for their offspring, and abhorring the 
thought of selling themselves as laborers. House- 
holds, too, were separated; the colonial news- 
papers contained advertisements of members of 
families seeking their companions, of sons anx- 
ious to reach and relieve their parents, of moth- 
ers moaning for their children. : 
The wanderers sighed for their native country; 
but, to prevent their return, their villages, from 
Annapolis to the isthmus, were laid waste. Their 
old homes were but ruins. In the district of 
Minas, for instance, two hundred and fifty of 
their houses, and more than as many barns, were 
consumed. ‘The live stock which belonged to 
them, consisting of great numbers of horned 
cattle, hogs, sheep, and horses, were seized as 
spoils and disposed of by the English officials. 
A beautiful and fertile tract of country was 
reduced to a solitude. There was none left round 
the ashes of the cottages of the Acadians but the 
faithful watch-dog, vainly seeking the hands that 
fed him. Thickets of forest-trees choked their 
orchards; the ocean broke over their neglected 
dikes, and desolated their meadows. 
Relentless misfortune pursued the exiles wher- 
ever they fled. Those sent to Georgia, drawn 
by a love for the spot where they were born, 
as strong as that of the captive Jews who wept 
by the rivers of Babylon for their own temple 
and land, escaped to sea in boats, and went 
coasting from harbor to harbor; but when they

  had reached New England, just as they would 
have set sail for their native fields, they were 
stopt by orders from Nova Scotia. Those who 
dwelt on the St. John’s were torn from their 
new homes. When Canada surrendered, hatred 
with its worst venom pursued the fifteen hundred 
who remained south of the Restigouche. Once 
those who dwe:t in Pennsylvania presented a 
humble petition to the Earl of Loudoun, then 
the British commander-in-chief in America; and 
the cold-hearted peer, offended that the prayer 
was made in French, seized their five principal 
men, who in their own land had been persons 
of dignity and substance, and shipped them to 
England, with the request that they might be 
kept from ever again becoming troublesome by 
being consigned to service as common sailors on 
board ships-of-war. No doubt existed of the 
King’s approbation. The lords of trade, more 
merciless than the savages and than the wilder- 
ness in winter, wished very much that every one 
of the Acadians should be driven out; and, when 
it seemed that the work was done, congratulated 
the King that ‘‘the zealous endeavors of Law- 
rence had been crowned with an entire success.’

  is all my art: my pencils will draw no other; 
my jack-knife will cut nothing else; I do not 
use it as a means.’’? This was the muse and 
genius that ruled his opinions, conversation, 
studies, work and course of life. This made him 
a searching judge of men. At first glance he - 
measured his companion, and, tho insensible to 
some fine traits of culture, could very well report 
his weight and caliber. And this made the im- 
pression of genius which his conversation often 
gave. 
I think his fancy for referring everything to 
the meridian of Concord did not grow out of 
any ignorance or depreciation of other longitudes 
or latitudes, but was rather a playful expression 
of his conviction of the indifferency of all places, 
and that the best place for each is where he 
stands. He exprest it once in this wise: ‘‘I think 
nothing is to be hoped from you, if this bit of 
mold under your feet is not sweeter to you to 
eat than any other in this world, or in any 
world.’’ 
The other weapon with which he conquered all 
obstacles in science was patience. He knew how 
to sit immovable, a part of the rock he rested 
on, until the bird, the reptile, the’ fish, which 
had retired from him, should come back, and re- 
sume his habits, nay, moved by curiosity, should 
come to him and watch him. 
It was a pleasure and a privilege to walk with 
him. He knew the country like a fox or a bird, 
and passed through it as freely by paths of his 
own. He knew every track in the snow or on 
the ground, and what creature had taken this 
path before him. One must submit abjectly to

  such a guide, and the reward was great. Under 
his arm he carried an old musie-book to press 
plants; in his pocket his diary and pencil, a spy- 
glass for birds, microscope, jack-knife, and 
twine, He wore straw hat, stout shoes, strong 
-gray trousers, to brave shrub-oaks and smilax, 
and to climb a tree for a hawk’s or a squirrel’s 
nest. He waded into the pool for the water- 
plants, and his strong legs were no insignificant 
part of his armor. 
No eollege ever offered him a diploma, or a 
professor’s chair; no academy made him its 
corresponding secretary, its discoverer, or even 
its member. Perhaps these learned bodies feared 
the satire of his presence. Yet so much knowl- 
edge of Nature’s secret and genius few others 
possest, none in a more large and religious syn- 
thesis. For not a particle of respect had he 
to the opinions of any man or body of men, but 
homage solely to the truth itself; and as he 
discovered everywhere among doctors some lean- 
ing of courtesy, it diseredited them. He grew 
to be revered and admired by his townsmen, who 
had at first known him only as an oddity. The 
farmers who employed him as a surveyor soon. 
discovered his rare aceuraey and skill, his knowl- 
edge of their lands, of trees, of birds, of Indian 
remains, and the like, which enabled him to tell 
every farmer more than he knew before of his 
own farm; so that he began to feel as if Mr. 
Thoreau had better rights in his land than he. 
They felt, too, the superiority of character which 
addrest all men with a native authority. 
His virtues, of course, sometimes ran into ex- 
tremes. It was easy to trace to the inexorable

  ' demand on all for exact truth that austerity 
which made this willing hermit more solitary 
even than he wished. Himself of a perfect probi- 
ty, he required not less of others. He had a 
disgust for erime, and no worldly success could 
cover it. He detected paltering as readily in 
dignified and prosperous persons as in beggars, 
and with equal scorn. Such dangerous frankness 
was in his dealing that his admirers called him 
‘that terrible Thoreau,’’ as if he spoke’ when 
silent, and was still present when he had de- 
parted. I think the severity of his ideal inter- 
fered to deprive him of a healthy sufficiency 
of human society. 
The habit of a realist to find things the reverse 
_of their appearance inclined him to put every 
statement in a paradox. A certain habit of 
antagonism defaced his earlier writings—a trick 
of rhetoric not quite outgrown in his later, of 
substituting for the obvious word and thought 
its diametrical opposite. He praised wild moun- 
tains and winter forests for their domestic air, 
in snow and ice he would find sultriness, and com- 
mended the wilderness for resembling Rome and 
Paris, ‘‘It was so dry that you might eall it 
wet.’’ 
The tendency to magnify the moment, to read 
all the laws of Nature in the one object or one 
eombination under your eye, is of course comic 
to those who do not share the philosopher’s per- 
ception of identity. To him there was no such 
thing as size. The pond was a small ocean; the 
Atlantic a large Walden Pond. He referred ev- 
ery minute fact to eosmical laws. Tho he meant 
to be just, he seemed haunted by a certain chronic 
226
-P-A-G-E-240
  RALPH WALDO EMERSON 
  ‘assumption that the science of the day pretended 
eompleteness, and he had just found out that the 
savants had neglected to discriminate a particular 
botanical variety, had failed to describe the seeds 
or count the sepals. ‘‘That is to say,’’ we re- 
plied, ‘‘the blockheads were not born in Concord; 
but who said they were? It was their unspeak- 
able misfortune to be born in London, or Paris, 
or Rome; but, poor fellows, they did what they 
could, considering that they never saw Bateman’s 
Pond, or Nine-acre Corner, or Becky Stow’s 
Swamp. Besides, what were you sent into the 
world for but to add this observation ?’” 
Had this genius been only contemplative, he 
had been fitted to his life, but with his energy 
and practical ability he seemed born for great 
enterprise and for command; and I so much 
regret the loss of his rare powers of action that 
I can not help counting it a fault in him 
that he had no ambition. Wanting this, instead 
of engineering for all America, he was the cap- 
tain of a huckleberry party. Pounding beans 
is good to the end of pounding empires one of 
these days; but if, at the end of years, it is still 
only beans! 
But these foibles, real or apparent, were fast 
vanishing in the incessant growth of a spirit 
so robust and wise, and which effaced its defeats 
with new triumphs. His study of nature was a 
perpetual ornament to him, and inspired his 
friends with curiosity to see the world through 
his eyes, and to hear his adventures. They pos- 
sest every kind of interest. 
He had many elegances of his own, while he 
scoffed at conventional elegance. Thus, he could 
227

  not bear to hear the sound of his own steps, the 
grit of gravel; and therefore never willingly 
walked in the road, but in the grass, on moun- 
tains and in woods. His senses were acute, and 
he remarked that by night every dwelling-house 
gives out bad air, like a slaughter-house. He 
liked the pure fragrance of melilot. He honored 
certain plants with special regard, and, over all, 
the pond lily, then the gentian, and the Mikania 
scandens, and ‘‘life-everlasting,’’ and a bass-tree 
which he visited every year when it bloomed, 
in the middle of July. He thought the scent 
a more oracular inquisition than the sight—more 
oracular and trustworthy. The scent, of course, 
reveals what it concealed from the other senses. By 
it he detected earthiness. He delighted in echoes, 
and said they were almost the only kind of 
kindred voices that he heard. He loved Nature 
so well, was so happy in her solitude, that he 
became very jealous of cities, and the sad work 
which their refinements and artifices made with 
man and his dwelling. The ax was always 
destroying his forest. ‘‘Thank God,’’ he said, 
“(they ean not eut down the clouds!’? . . . 
The seale on which his studies proceeded was 
so large as to require longevity, and we were the 
less prepared for his sudden disappearance. The 
country knows not yet, or in the least part, how 
great a son it has lost. It seems an injury that 
he should leave in the midst his broken “task, 
which none else can finish—a kind of indignity 
to so noble a soul, that it should depart out of 
Nature before yet he has been really shown to his 
peers for what he is. But he, at least, is content.

THE INTELLECTUAL HONESTY OF 
MONTAIGNE? 
A sinciz odd volume of Cotton’s translation 
of the Essays remained to me from my father’s 
library, when a boy. It lay long neglected, until, 
after many years, when I was newly escaped 
from college, I read the book, and procured the 
remaining volumes. J remember the delight and . 
wonder in which I lived with it. It seemed to 
me as if I had myself written the book, in some 
former life, so sincerely it spoke to my thought 
» and experience. It happened, when in Paris, in 
1833, that, in the cemetery of Pere le Chaise, 
I came to a tomb of August Collignon, who died 
in 1830, aged sixty-eight years, and who, said 
the monument, ‘‘lived to do right, and had 
formed himself to virtue on the Essays of Mon- 
taigne.’’ Some years later, I became acquainted 
with an accomplished English poet, John Ster- 
ling; and, in prosecuting my correspondence, I 
found that, from a Jove of Montaigne, he had 
made a pilgrimage to his chateau, still standing 
near Castellan, in Perigord, and, after two hun- 
dred and fifty years, had copied from the walls 
3¥rom “Montaigne; or The Skeptic," in “Representative Men.” Published by Houghton, Miflin & Company.

  of his library the inscriptions which Montaigne 
had written there. That Journal of Mr. Ster- 
ling’s, published in the Westminster Review, Mr. 
Hazlitt has reprinted in the Prolegomena to his 
edition of the Essays. I heard with pleasure 
that one of the newly-discovered autographs of 
William Shakespeare was in a copy of Florio’s 
translation of Montaigne. It is the only book 
which we certainly know to have been in the 
poet’s library. And, oddly enough, the duplicate 
copy of Florio, which the British Museum pur- 
chased with a view of protecting the Shakespeare 
autograph (as I was informed in the Museum), 
turned out to have the autograph of Ben Jonson 
in the fly-leaf. Leigh Hunt relates of Lord Byron 
that Montaigne was the only great writer of 
past times whom he read with avowed satisfae- 
tion. Other coincidences, not needful to be men- 
tioned here, concurred to make this old Gascon 
still new and immortal for me. 
In 1571, on the death of his father, Montaigne, 
then thirty-eight years old, retired from the 
practise of law at Bordeaux, and settled himself 
on his estate. Tho he had been a man of pleas- 
ure, and sometimes a courtier, his studious habits 
now grew on him, and he loved the compass, 
staidness, and independence of the country gen- 
tleman’s life. He took up his economy in good, 
earnest, and made his farms yield the most. 
Downright and plain-dealing, and abhorring to 
be deceived or to deceive, he was esteemed in the 
country for his sense and probity. In the civil 
wars of the League, which converted every house 
into a fort, Montaigne kept his gates open, and 
his house without defense. All parties freely

  eame and went, his courage and honor being 
universally esteemed. The neighboring lords and 
gentry brought jewels and papers to him for 
safe-keeping. Gibbon reckons, in these bigoted 
times, but two men of liberality in France — 
Henry IV and Montaigne.

HIS VISIT TO CARLYLE AT CRAIGEN- 
PUTTOCK* 
(1833) 
From Edinburgh I went to the Highlands. On 
_ my return I came from Glasgow to Dumfries, 
and being intent on delivering a letter which 
I had brought from Rome, inquired for Craigen- 
puttock. It was a farm in Nithsdale, in the 
parish of Dunscore, sixteen miles distant. No 
public coach passed near it, so I took a private 
carriage from the inn. I found the house amid 
desolate heathery hills, where the lonely scholar 
nourished his mighty heart. Carlyle was a man 
from his youth, an author who did not need to 
hide from his readers, and as absolute a man of 
the world, unknown and exiled on that hill-farm, 
as if holding on his own terms what is best in 
*¥rom Chapter I of “English Traits,” published by Hough- 
ton, Mifflin Company. At the time of this visit, Emerson had 
published none of his books, but Carlyle was known as the 
author of many of the “Essays” now included among his 
collected writings, and had published the “Life of Schiller”

  London. He was tall and gaunt, with cliff-like 
brow, self-possest, and holding his extraordinary 
powers of conversation in easy command; cling- 
ing to his northern accent with evident relish; 
full of lively anecdote, and with a streaming hu- 
mor, which floated everything he looked upon. 
His talk playfully exalting the familiar objects, 
put the companion at once into an acquaintance 
with his Lars and Lemurs, and it was very pleas- 
‘ant to learn what was predestined to be a pretty 
mythology. Few were the objects and lonely 
the man, ‘‘not a person to speak to within six- 
teen miles except the minister of Dunscore’’; 
so that books inevitably made his topics. 
He had names of his own for all the matters 
familiar to his discourse. Blackwood's was the 
‘‘sand magazine’’; Fraser’s nearer approach to 
possibility of life ‘was the ‘mud magazine’; a 
piece of road near by that marked some failed 
enterprise was the “grave of the last sixpence.’? 
When too much praise of any genius annoyed 
him, he profest hugely to admire the talent shown 
by his pig. He had spent much time and con- 
trivance in confining the poor beast to one en- 
elosure in his pen, but pig, by great strokes of 
judgment, had found out how to let a board 
down, and had foiled him. For all that, he still 
thought man the most plastic little fellow in the 
planet, and he liked Nero’s death, ‘‘Qualis artifex 
pereo!’’ better than most history. He worships 
a man that will manifest any truth to him. At 
one time he had inquired and read a good deal 
about America. Landor’s principle was mere 
rebellion, and that he feared was the American 
prineiple. The best thing he knew of that coun- 
232

  try was that in it a man can have meat for his 
labor. He had read in Stewart’s book that, when 
he inquired in a New York hotel for the Boots, 
he had been shown across the street and had 
found Mungo in his own house dining on roast 
turkey. 
We talked of books. Plato he does not read, 
and he disparaged Socrates; and, when prest, 
persisted in making Mirabeau a hero. Gibbon 
he called the splendid bridge from the old world 
to the new. His own reading had been multifa- 
rious. ‘‘Tristram Shandy’’ was one of his first 
books after ‘‘Robinson Crusoe,’’ and Robertson’s 
*« America’? an early favorite. Rousseau’s ‘‘Con- 
fessions’’ had discovered to him that he was not 
a dunce; and it was now ten years since he had 
learned German, by the advice of a man who told 
him he would find in that language what he 
wanted. ‘ 
He took despairing or satirical views of litera- 
ture at this moment; recounted the ineredible 
sums paid in one year by the great booksellers 
for puffing. Hence it comes that no newspaper 
is trusted now, no books are bought, and the 
booksellers are on the eve of bankruptcy. 
He still returned to English pauperism, the 
crowded eountry, the selfish abdication by public 
men of all that publie persons should perform. 
“¢Government should direct poor men what to do. 
Poor Irish folk come wandering over these moors. 
My dame makes it a rule to give to every son 
of Adam bread to eat, and supplies his wants to 
the next house. But here are thousands of acres 
which might give them all meat, and nobody to bid 
these poor Irish go to the moor and till it. They

  burned the stacks, and so found a way to force 
the rich people to attend to them.’’ 
We went out to walk over long hills, and 
looked at Criffel, then without his cap, and down 
into Wordsworth’s country. There we sat down, 
and talked of the immortality of the sonl. It 
was not Carlyle’s fault that we talked on that 
topic, for he had the natural disinclination of 
every nimble spirit to bruise itself against walls, 
and did not like to place himself where no step 
ean be taken. But he was honest and true, and 
cognizant of the subtile links that bind ages 
together, and saw how every event affects all 
the future. ‘‘Christ died on the tree: that built 
Dunscore kirk yonder: that brought you and me 
together. Time had only a relative existence.’’ 
He was already turning his eyes toward London 
with a scholar’s appreciation. London is the 
heart of the world, he said, wonderful only from 
the mass of human beings. He liked the huge 
machine. Hach keeps its own round. The ba- 
ker’s boy brings muffins to the window at a 
fixt hour every day, and that is all the Londoner 
knows or wishes to know on the subject. But 
it turned out good men. He named certain in- 
dividuals, especially one man of letters, his 
friend, the best mind he knew, whom London 
had well served.

OCCUPANTS OF AN OLD MANSE* 
Brrwren two tall gate-posts of rough-hewn 
stone (the gate itself having fallen from its 
hinges at some unknown epoch) we beheld the 
gray front of the old parsonage terminating the 
. vista of an avenue of black-ash trees. It was 
now a twelvemonth since the funeral procession 
of the venerable clergyman, its last inhabitant, 
had turned from that gateway toward the village - 
burying-ground. The wheel track leading to the 
door, as well as the whole breadth of the avenue, 
was almost overgrown with grass, affording dain- 
ty mouthfuls to two or three vagrant cows and

house, built in 1765, is still standing in Concord. Emerson

  an old white horse who had his own living to 
pick up along the roadside. The glimmering 
shadows that lay half asleep between the door 
. of the house and the publie highway were a kind 
of spiritual medium, seen through which the 
edifice had not quite the aspect of belonging to 
the material world. Certainly, it had little in 
common with those ordinary abodes which stand 
so imminent upon the road that every passer-by 
ean thrust his: head, as it were, into the domestic 
circle. From these quiet windows the figures of 
passing travelers look too remote and dim to 
disturb the sense of privacy. In its near retire- 
ment and accessible seclusion, it was the very 
spot for the residence of a clergyman—a man 
not estranged from human life, yet enveloped, 
in the midst of it, with a veil woven of inter- 
mingled gloom and brightness. It was worthy to 
have been one of the time-honored parsonages 
of England, in which through many generations a 
suceession of holy occupants pass from youth to 
age, and bequeath each an inheritance of sanctity 
to pervade the house and hover over it as with 
an atmosphere. 
Nor, in truth, had the Old Manse ever been 
profaned by a lay occupant until that memorable 
summer afternoon when I entered it as my home. 
A priest had built it; a priest had sueceeded to 
it; other priestly men from time to time had 
dwelt in it; and children born in its chambers 
had grown up to assume the priestly, character. 
It was awful to reflect how many sermons must 
have been written there. The latest inhabitant 
alone—he by whose translation to paradise the 
dwelling was left vacant—had penned nearly 
236

  three thousand discourses, besides the better if 
not the greater number that gushed living from 
his lips. How often, no doubt, had he paced 
to and fro along the avenue, attuning his medita- 
tions to the sighs and gentle murmurs and deep 
and solemn peals of the wind among the tops of 
the lofty trees! In that variety of natural utter- 
anees he could find something accordant with ev- 
ery passage of his sermon, were it of tenderness 
or reverential fear. The boughs over my head 
seemed shadowy with solemn thoughts, as well 
as with rustling leaves. 
I took shame to myself for having been so long 
a writer of idle stories, and ventured to hope 
that wisdom would descend upon me with the 
falling leaves of the avenue, and that I should 
light upon an intellectual treasure in the Old 
Manse well worth those hoards of long-hidden 
gold which people seek for in moss-grown houses. 
Profound treatises of morality, a layman’s un- 
professional and therefore unprejudiced views 
of religion, histories (such as Bancroft might 
have written had he taken up his abode here, 
as he once proposed) bright with picture, gleam- 
ing over a depth of philosophic thought—these 
were the works that might fitly have flowed from 
such a retirement. In the humblest event, I 
resolved at least to achieve a novel that should 
evolve some deep lesson, and should possess phys- 
ical substance enough to stand alone. . . . 
The study had three windows set with little 
old-fashioned panes of glass, each with a erack 
across it, The two on the western side looked 
or rather peeped between the willow branches 
down into the orchard, with glimpses of the river 
237
-P-A-G-E-251

  through the trees. The third, facing northward, 
commanded a broader view of the river at a spot 
where its hitherto obscure waters gleam forth 
into the light of history. It was at this window 
that the clergyman who then dwelt in the manse 
stood watching the outbreak of, a long and deadly 
struggle between two nations.? He saw the ir- 
regular array of his parishioners on the farther 
side of the river, and the glittering line of the 
British on the hither bank; he awaited in an 
agony of suspense the rattle of the musketry. 
It came; and there needed but a gentle wind 
to sweep the battle smoke around this quiet 
house. 
When summer was dead and buried, the Old 
Manse became as lonely as a hermitage. Not 
that ever—in my time at least—it had been 
thronged with company; but at no rare intervals 
we welcomed some friend out of the dusty glare 
and tumult of the world, and rejoiced to share 
with him the transparent obscurity that was 
floating over us. In one respect our precincts - 
were like the Enchanted Ground through which 
the pilgrim traveled on his way to the Celestial 
City. The guests, each and all, felt a slumbrous 
influence upon them; they fell asleep in chairs, 
or took a more deliberate siesta on the sofa, or 
were seen stretched among the shadows of the 
orchard, looking up dreamily through the boughs. 
* They could not have paid a more acceptable com- 
pliment to my abode, nor to my own qualities 
as a host. I held it as a proof that they left 
their cares behind them.as they passed between

Hobgoblins of flesh and blood were attracted 
thither by the wide-spreading influence of a great 
original thinker, who had his earthly abode at 
the opposite extremity of our village. His mind 
acted upon other minds of a certain constitution 
with wonderful magnetism, and drew many men 
upon long pilgrimages to speak with him face to 
faee. Young visionaries, to whom just so much 
of insight had been imparted as to make life 
all a labyrinth around them, came to seek the 
clue that should guide them out of their self- 
involved bewilderment. Gray-headed_ theorists, 
whose systems, at first air, had finally imprisoned 
them in an iron framework, traveled painfully 
to his door, not to ask deliverance, but to invite 
the free spirit into their own thraldom. People 
that had lighted on a new thought, or a thought 
that they fancied new, eame to Emerson, as the 
finder of a glittering gem hastens to a lapidary 
to ascertain its quality and value. Uncertain, 
troubled, earnest wanderers through the midnight 
of a moral world beheld its intellectual fire as a 
beacon burning on a hill-top, and climbing the 
difficult ascent, looked forth into the surrounding 
obscurity more hopefully than hitherto. The 
light revealed objects unseen before—mountains, 
gleaming lakes, glimpses of a creation among 
the chaos; but also, as was unavoidable, it at- 
tracted bats and owls and the whole host of night 
birds, which flapped their dusky wings against 
the gazer’s eyes, and sometimes were mistaken

ways hover nigh whenever  beacon-fire of truth 
is kindled. . : 
For myself, there had been epochs of my life 
when I too might have asked of this prophet 
the waster word that should solve me the riddle 
of the universe; but now, being happy, I felt 
as if there were no question to be put, and there- 
fore admired Emerson as a poet of deep beauty 
and austere tenderness, but sought nothing from 
him as a philosopher. It was good nevertheless 
to meet him in the wood paths, or sometimes in 
our avenue, with that pure intellectual gleam 
diffused, about his presence like the garment of a 
Shining One; and he so quiet, so simple, so with-~ 
out pretension, encountering each man alike as 
if expecting to receive more than he could im~ 
part. And in truth, the heart of many an or- 
dinary man had, perchance, inscriptions which 
he could not read. 
But it was impossible to dwell in his vicinity 
without inhaling more or less the mountain at- 
mosphere of his lofty thought, which in the 
brains of some people wrought a singular giddi- 
ness—new truth being as heady as new wine. 
Never was a poor little country village infested 
with such a variety of queer, strangely drest, 
oddly behaved mortals, most of whom took upon 
themselves to be important agents of the world’s 
destiny, yet were simply bores of a very intense 
water. Such, I imagine, is the invariable char- 
acter of persons who erowd so closely about an 
original thinker as to draw in his unuttered 
breath, and thus to become imbued with a false 
originality. This triteness of novelty is enough

  ’ to make any man of common sense blaspheme at 
all ideas of less than a century’s standing, and 
pray that the world may be petrified and ren- 
dered immovable in precisely the worst moral 
and physical state that it ever yet arrived at, 
rather than be benefited by such schemes of such 
philosophers. . . . 
Glancing back over what I have written, it 
seems but the seattered reminiscences of a single 
summer. In fairyland there is no measurement 
of time; and in a spot so sheltered from the tur- 
moil of life’s ocean, three years hasten away with 
a noiseless flight, as the breezy sunshine chases 
the cloud shadows across the depths of a still 
valley. Now came hints, growing more and more 
distinct, that the owner of the old house was 
pining for his native air. Carpenters next ap- 
peared, making a tremendous racket among the 
outbuildings, strewing the green grass with pine 
shavings and chips of chestnut joists, and vexing 
the whole antiquity of the place with their dis- 
cordant renovations. Soon, moreover, they di- 
vested our abode of the veil of woodbine which 
had crept over a large portion of its southern 
face. All the aged mosses were cleared unspa- 
ringly away, and there were horrible whispers 
about brushing up the external walls with a coat 
of paint—a purpose as little to my taste as might 
be that of rouging the venerable cheeks of one’s 
grandmother. But the hand that renovates is 
always more sacrilegious than that which de- 
stroys. In fine, we gathered up our household 
goods, drank a farewell cup of tea in our pleasant 
little breakfast-room—delicately fragrant tea, en 
unpurchasable luxury, one of the many angel

gifts that had fallen like dew upon us—and

me by the hand, and—an oddity of dispensation

ARTHUR DIMMESDALE ON THE 
SCAFFOLD * 
THE crowd was in a tumult. The men of rank 
and dignity, who stood more immediately around 
the clergyman, were so taken by surprize, and 
so perplexed as to the purport of what they saw 
—unable to receive the explanation. which most 
readily presented itself, or to imagine any other— 
that they remained silent and inactive spectators 
of the judgment which Providence seemed about 
to work. They beheld the minister, leaning on 
Hester’s shoulder, and supported by her arm 
around him, approach the scaffold, and ascend 
its steps; while still the little hand of the sin- 
born child was clasped in his. Old Roger Chill-

ingworth followed, as one intimately connected 
with the drama of guilt and sorrow in which they 
had all been actors, and well entitled, therefore, 
to be present at its closing scene. 
“‘Hadst thou sought the whole earth over,’? 
said he, looking darkly at the clergyman, ‘‘there 
‘was no one place so seeret—no high place nor 
lowly place, where thon couldst have escaped 
me—save on this very seaffold!’’ 
‘Thanks be to Him who hath led me hither!’? 
answered the minister. 
Yet he trembled, and turned to Hester with 
an expression of doubt and anxiety in his eyes, 
not the less evidently betrayed that there was 
a feeble smile upon his lips. 
“Tg not this better,’’ murmured he, ‘‘than 
what we dreamed of in the forest?’’ 
“T know not! I know not!’’ she hurriedly 
replied. ‘‘Better? Yea; so we may both die, 
and little Pearl die with us!’’ 
‘<Poy thee and Pearl, be it as God shall order,’’ 
said the minister; ‘‘and God is merciful! Let 
me now do the will which He hath made plain 
before my sight. For, Hester, I am a dying 
man. So let me make haste to take my shame 
upon me!’” 
Partly supported by Hester Prynne, and hold- 
ing one hand of little Pearl’s, the Reverend Mr. 
Dimmesdale turned to the dignified and venerable 
rulers; to the holy ministers, who were his breth- 
ren; to the people, whose great heart was thor- 
oughly appalled, yet overflowing with tearful 
sympathy, as knowing that some deep life-matter 
—which, if full of sin, was full of anguish and 
repentance likewise—was now to be laid open to 
243

  them. The sun, but little past its meridian, shone 
down upon the clergyman, and gave a distinctness 
to his figure as he stood out from all the earth 
to put in his plea of guilty at the bar of Eternal 
Justice. . 
‘People of New England!’’ cried he, with a 
voice that rose over them, high, solemn, and 
majestic—yet had always a tremor through it, 
and sometimes a shrick, struggling up out of 
a fathomless depth of remorse and wo—‘ye 
that have loved me!—ye that have deemed me 
~ holy!—behold me here, the one sinner of the 
world! At last!—at last!—I stand upon the 
spot where, seven years since, I should have 
stood; here, with this woman, whose arm, more 
than the little strength wherewith I have erept 
hitherward, sustains me, at this dreadful moment, 
from groveling down upon my face! Lo, the 
scarlet letter which Hester wears! Ye have all 
shuddered at it! Wherever her walk hath been— 
wherever, so miserably burdened, she may have 
hoped to find repose—it hath cast a lurid gleam 
of awe and horrible repugnance round about her. 
But there stood one in the midst of you, at whose 
brand of sin and infamy ye have not shuddered!’’ 
It seemed, at this point, as if the minister 
must leave the remainder of his secret undis- 
closed. But he fought back the bodily weak- 
ness—and, still more, the faintness of heart— 
that was striving for the mastery with him. He 
threw off all assistance, and stept passionately 
forward a pace before the woman and the child. 
**Tt was on him!’’ he continued, with a kind 
of fiereeness—so determined was he to speak 
out the whole. ‘‘God’s eye beheld it! The an- 
244
-P-A-G-E-258
  NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE 
  gels were forever pointing at it! The devil knew 
it well, and fretted it continually with the touch 
of his burning finger! But he hid it cunningly 
from men, and walked among you with the 
mien of a spirit, mournful, because so pure in 
a sinful world—and sad, because he missed his 
heavenly kindred! Now, at the death-hour, he 
stands up before you! He bids you look again 
at Hester’s scarlet letter! He tells you that, 
with all its mysterious horror, it is but the 
shadow of what he bears on his own breast, and 
that even this, his own red stigma, is no more 
than the type of what has seared his inmost 
heart! Stand any here that question God’s judg- 
ment on a sinner? Behold! Behold a dreadful 
witness of it!’’ 
With a convulsive motion, he tore away the 
ministerial band from his breast. It was re- 
vealed! But it were irreverent to describe that 
revelation.. For an instant the gaze of the hor- 
ror-stricken multitude was concentrated on the 
ghastly miracle; while the minister stood, with 
a flush of triumph in his face, as one who, in the 
crisis of acutest pain, had won a victory. Then, 
down he sank upon the scaffold! Hester partly 
raised him, and supported his head against her 
bosom. Old Roger Chillingworth knelt down be- 
side him, with a blank, dull countenance, out of 
whieh the life seemed to have departed. 
‘¢Thou hast escaped me!’’ he repeated more 
than once. ‘‘Thou hast escaped me!’’ 
‘‘May God forgive thee!’’ said the minister. 
*¢Thou, too, hast deeply sinned!’’ 
He withdrew his dying eyes from the old man, 
and fixt them on the woman and the child. 
245

  ‘‘My little Pearl,’’ said he, feebly—and there 
was a sweet and gentle smile over his face, as of 
a spirit sinking into deep repose; nay, now that 
the burden was removed, it seemed almost as if 
he would be sportive with the child—‘dear little 
Pearl, wilt thou kiss me now? Thou wouldst not 
yonder, in the forest! But now thou wilt?’’ 
Pear! kissed his lips, A spell was broken. The 
great scene of grief, in which the wild infant 
bore a part, had developed all her sympathies; 
and as her tears fell upon her father’s cheek, 
they were the pledge that she would grow up 
amid human joy and sorrow, nor forever do 
battle with the world, but be a woman in it. To- 
ward her mother, too, Pearl’s errand as a mes- 
senger of anguish was all fulfilled. 
‘*Hester,’’ said the clergyman, ‘‘farewell!’’ 
‘*Shall we not meet again?’’ whispered she, 
bending her face down elose to his. ‘‘Shall we 
not spend our immortal life together? Surely, 
surely, we have ransomed one. another with all 
this wo! Thou lookest far into eternity, with 
those bright dying eyes! Then tell me what 
thou _seest ?’’ 
‘‘Hush, Hester, hush!’’ said he, with tremulous 
solemnity. ‘‘The law we broke!—the sin here 
so awfully revealed! — let these be in thy 
thoughts! I fear! I fear! It may be that, when 
we forgot our God—when we violated our rever- 
ence each for the other’s soul—it was thenceforth 
vain to hope that we could meet hereafter, in an 
everlasting and pure reunion. God knows; and 
He is merciful! He hath proved His mercy, most 
of all, in my afflictions. By giving me this burn- 
ing torture to bear upon my breast! By sending 
246 .
-P-A-G-E-260

yonder dark and terrible old man, to keep the 
torture always at red heat! By bringing me 
hither to die this death of triumphant ignominy 
before the people! Had either of these agonies 
been wanting, I had been lost forever! Praised 
be His name! His will be done! Farewell!’’ 
That final word came forth with the minister’s 
expiring breath, The multitude, silent till then, 
broke out in a strange, deep voice of awe and 
wonder, which could not as yet find utterance 
save in this murmur that rolled so heavily after 
the departed spirit. 
After many days, when time sufficed for the 
people to arrange their thoughts in reference to 
the foregoing scene, there was more than one 
aecount of what had been witnessed on the scaf- 
‘old. 
Most of the spectators testified to having seen 
on the breast of the unhappy minister a SC4RLET 
Lerrer—the very semblance of that worn. by 
Hester Prynne—imprinted in the fiesh. As re- 
garded its origin, there were various explana- 
tions, all of which must necessarily have been 
conjectural. Dome affirmed that the Reverend 
Mr. Dimmesdale, on the very day when Hester « 
Prynne first wore her ignominious badge, had 
begun a course of penance—which he afterward, 
in so many futile methods, followed out—by in- 
flicting a hideous torture on himself. Others con- 
tended that the stigma had not been produced 
until a long time subsequent, when old Roger 
Chillingworth, being a potent necromancer, had 
caused it to appear, through the agency of magic 
and poisonous drugs. Others, again—and those 
best able to appreciate the minister’s peculiar

  sensibility, and the wonderful operation of his 
spirit upon the body—whispered their belief that 
the awful symbol was the effect of the ever-active 
tooth of remorse, rnawing from the inmost heart 
outwardly, and at last manifesting Heaven’s 
dreadful judgment by the visible presence of the 
letter. The reader may choose among these the- 
ories. We have thrown all the light we could 
acquire upon the portent, and would gladly, now 
that it has done its office, erase its deep print 
out of our own brain, where long meditation 
has fixt it in very undesirable distinctness. 
YI 
OF LIFE AT BROOK FARM* 
We had very young people with us, it is true— 
downy lads, rosy girls in their first teens, and 
children of all heights above one’s knee; but 
these had chiefly been sent hither for education, 
which it was one of the objects and methods of 
our institution to supply. Then we had boarders 
from town and elsewhere, who lived with us in 
a familiar way, sympathized more or less in our 
theories, and: sometimes shared in our labors. 
On the whole, it was a society such as has 
seldom met together; nor, perhaps, could it rea- 
sonably be expected to hold together long. Per- 
sons of marked individuality—erooked sticks, as 
‘From “The Blithedale Romance,” published by Houghton, Mifflin Company. Hawthorne was a member of the Brook 
Farm Community of Roxbury, Mass., and from it derived at 
least suggestions for the scene and action of this story,

  some of us might be called—are not exactly the 
easiest to bind up into a fagot. But, so long as 
our union should subsist, a man of intellect and 
feeling, with a free nature in him, might have 
sought far and near without finding so many 
points of attraction as would allure him hither- 
ward. We were of all ereeds and opinions, and 
generally tolerant of all, on every imaginable 
subject. Our.bond, it seems to me, was not af- 
firmative, but negative. We had individually 
found one thing or another to quarrel with in 
our past life, and were pretty well agreed as to 
the inexpediency of lumbering along with the old 
system any further. As to what should be sub- 
stituted there was much less unanimity. We did 
not greatly care—at least, I never did—for the 
written constitution under which our millennium 
had commenced. My hope was that, between 
theory and practise, a true and available mode 
of life might be struck ont; and that, even should © 
we ultimately fail, the months or years spent in 
the trial would not have been wasted, either as 
regarded passing enjoyment, or the experience 
which makes men wise. 
Arcadians tho we were, our costume bore no 
resemblance to the. beribboned doublets, silk 
breeches and stockings, and slippers fastened 
with artificial roses, that distinguish the pastoral 
people of poetry and the stage. In outward 
show, I humbly conceive, we looked rather like 
a gang of beggars, or banditti, than either a 
company of honest laboring-men, or a conclave 
of philosophers. Whatever might be our points 
of difference, we all of us seemed to have come 
to Blithedale with the one thrifty and laudable 
249
-P-A-G-E-263
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  idea of wearing out our old clothes. Such gar- 
ments as had an airing whenever we strode afield! 
Coats with high eollars and. with no collars, 
broad-skirted or swallow-tailed, and with the 
waist at every point between the hip and the 
armpit; pantaloons of a dozen successive epochs, 
and greatly defaced at the knees by. the humilia- 
tions of the wearer before his lady-love—in short, 
‘we were a living epitome of defunct fashions, 
and the very raggedest presentment of men who 
had seen better days. It was gentility in tatters. 
Often retaining a scholarlike or clerical air, you 
might have taken us for the denizens of Grub 
street, intent on getting a comfortable livelihood 
by agricultural labor; or, Coleridge’s projected 
Pantisocracy in full experiment; or Candide and 
his motley associates, at work in their cabbage- 
garden; or anything else that was miserably out 
at elbows, and most clumsily patched in the rear. 
We might have been sworn comrades to Falstaft’s 
yagged regiment. Little skill as we boasted in 
other points of husbandry, every mother’s son of 
us would have served admirably to stick up for 
a searecrow. And the worst of the matter was 
that the first energetic movement essential to 
one downright stroke of real labor was sure to 
put a finish to these poor habiliments. So we 
gradually flung them all aside, and took to hon- 
est homespun and linsey-woolsey, as preferable, 
on the whole, to the plan recommended, I think, 
by Virgil—‘ Ara nudus; sere nudus,’’—which, as 
Silas Foster remarked, when I translated the 
maxiza, would be apt to astonish the women- 
‘olks. ‘ 
After a reasonable training, the yeoman life 
250
-P-A-G-E-264
  NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE 
  throve well with us. Our faces took the sunburn 
kindly; our chests gained in compass, and our 
shoulders in breadth and squareness; our great 
brown fists looked as if they had never been capa- 
ble of kid gloves. The plow, the hoe, the seythe, 
and the hay-fork grew familiar to our grasp. 
The oxen responded to our voices. We could do 
almost as fair a day’s work as Silas Foster him- 
self, sleep dreamlessly after it, and awake at 
daybreak with only a little stiffness of the joints, 
which was usually quite gone by breakfast-time. 
To be sure, our next neighbors pretended to 
be incredulous as to our real proficiency in the 
business which we had taken in hand. They told 
slanderous fables about our inability to yoke our 
own oxen, or to drive them afield when yoked, 
or to release the poor brutes from their conjugal 
bond at nightfall. They had the face to say, too, 
that the cows laughed at our awkwardness at 
milking-time, and invariably kicked over the 
pails; partly in consequence of our putting the 
stool on the wrong side, and partly because, 
taking offense at the whisking of their tails, we 
were in the habit of holding these natural fly- 
flappers with one hand, and milking with the 
other. They further averred that we hoed up 
whole acres of Indian corn and other erops, and 
drew the earth carefully about the weeds; and 
that we raised five hundred tufts of burdock, 
mistaking them for cabbages; and that, by dint 
of unskilful planting, few of our seeds ever came 
up at all, or, if they did come up, it was stern- 
foremost; and that we spent the better part of 
the month of June in reversing a field of beans, 
which had thrust themselves out of the ground 
251

  in this unseemly way. They quoted it as nothing 
more than an ordinary occurrence for one or 
other of us to crop off two or three fingers, of a 
morning, by our clumsy use ofthe hay-eutter. 
Finally, and as an ultimate catastrophe, these 
mendacious rogues circulated a report that we 
communitarians were exterminated, to the last 
man, by severing ourselves asunder with the 
sweep of our own scythes!—and that the world 
had lost nothing by this little accident.

THE DEATH OF JUDGE PYNCHEON® 
Mranwuits the twilight is glooming upward 
out of the corners of the room. .'The shadows 
of the tall furniture grow deeper, and at first 
become more definite; then, spreading wider, they 
lose their distinctness of outline in the dark 
gray tide of oblivion, as it were, that creeps 
slowly over the various objects, and the one hu- 
man figure sitting in the midst of them. The 
gloom has not entered from without; it has 
brooded here all day,'and now, taking its own 
inevitable time, will. possess itself of everything. 
The Judge’s face, indeed, rigid, and singularly 
white, refuses to melt into this universal solvent. 
Fainter and fainter grows the light. It is as 
if another double-handful of darkness had been 
seattered through the air. Now it is no longer 
gray, but sable. There is still a faint appearance

at the window; neither a glow, nor a gleam, nor 
a glimmer—any phrase of light would express 
something far brighter than this doubtful per- 
ception, or sense, rather, that there is a window 
there. Has it yet vanished? No!—yes!—not 
quite! And there is still the swarthy whiteness 
—we shall venture to marry these ill-agreeing 
words—the swarthy whiteness of Judge Pyn- 
cheon’s face. The features are all gone: there 
is only the paleness of them left. And how looks 
it now? There is no window! There is no face! 
An infinite, inscrutable blackness has annihilated 
sight! Where is our universe? All crumbled 
away from us; and we, adrift in chaos, may 
harken to the gusts of homeless wind, that go 
sighing and murmuring about, in quest of what 
‘was once a world! 
Is there no other sound? One other, and a fear- 
fal one. It is the ticking of the Judge’s watch, 
which, ever since Hepzibah left the room in 
search of Clifford, he has been holding in his 
hand. Be the cause what it may, this little, 
quiet, never-ceasing throb of Time’s pulse, re- 
peating its small strokes with such busy reg- 
ularity, in Judge Pyncheon’s motionless hand, 
has an effect of terror, which we do not find in 
any other accompaniment of the scene. 
But, listen! That puff of the breeze was 
louder; it had a tone unlike the dreary and sullen 
one which has bemoaned itself, and afflicted all 
mankind with miserable sympathy, for five days 
past. The wind has veered about! It now comes ' 
boisterously from the northwest, and, taking hold 
of the aged framework of the Seven Gables, gives 
it a shake, like a wrestler that would try strength 
253

with his antagonist. Another and another sturdy 
tussle with the blast! The old house ecreaks 
again, and makes a vociferous but somewhat un- 
intelligible bellowing in its sooty throat (the big 
flue, we mean, of its wide chimney), partly in 
complaint at the rude wind, but rather, as befits 
their century and a half of hostile intimacy, in 
tough defianee. A rumbling kind of a bluster roars 
behind the fireboard. A door has slammed above 
stairs. A window, perhaps, has been left open, 
* or else is driven in by an unruly gust. It is not 
to be conceived, beforehand, what wonderful 
wind-instruments are these old timber mansions, 
and how haunted with the strangest noises, which 
immediately begin to sing, and sigh, and sob, and 
shriek—and to smite with sledge-hammers, airy 
but ponderous, in some distant chamber—and to 
tread along the entries as with stately footsteps, 
and rustle up and down the staircase, as with 
silks miraculously stiff — whenever the gale 
catches the house with a window open, and gets 
fairly into it. Would that we were not an at- 
tendant spirit here! It is too awful! This cla- 
mor of the wind through the lonely house; the 
Judge’s quietude, as he sits invisible; and that 
pertinacious ticking of his watch! . . . 
Yonder leaden Judge sits immovably upon our 
soul, Wili he never stir again? We shall go 
mad unless he stirs! You may the better estimate 
his quietude by the fearlessness of a little mouse, 
which sits on its hind legs, in a streak of moon- 
light, close by Judge Pyncheon’s foot, and seems 
to meditate a journey of exploration over this 
great black bulk. Ha! what has startled the 
nimble little mouse? It is the visage of: grimal-

  kin, outside of the window, where he appears to 
have posted himself for a deliberate watch. This 
grimalkin has a very ugly. look. Is it a cat 
watching for a mouse, or the devil for a human 
soul? Would we could scare him from the win- 
dow! 
Thank heaven, the night is well-nigh past! The 
moonbeams have no longer so silvery a gleam, 
nor contrast so strongly with the blackness of 
the shadows among which they fall. They are 
paler, now; the shadows look gray, not black. 
The boisterous wind is hushed. What is the 
hour? Ah! the watch has at last ceased to tick; 
for the Judge’s forgetful fingers neglected to 
wind it up, as usual, at ten o’clock, being half 
an hour or so before his ordinary bedtime—and 
it has run down, for the first time in five years. 
But the great world-clock of Time still keeps 
its beat. The dreary night—for, oh, how dreary 
seems its haunted waste, behind us—gives place 
to.a fresh, transparent cloudless morn. Blest, 
blest radiance! The day-beam—even what little 
of it finds its way into this always dusky parlor— 
seems part of the universal benediction, annuilling 
evil, and rendering all goodness possible and 
happiness attainable. Will Judge Pyncheon now 
rise up from his chair? Will he go forth, and 
receive the early sunbeams on his brow? Will 
he begin this new day—which God has smiled 
upon, and blest, and given to mankind—will he 
begin it with better purposes than the many 
that have been spent amiss? Or are all the 
deep-laid schemes of yesterday as stubborn in his 
heart, and as busy in his brain, as ever? . .

away? Art thou too sluggish? Thou man, that

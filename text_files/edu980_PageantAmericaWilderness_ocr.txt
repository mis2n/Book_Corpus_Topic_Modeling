    THE AMERICAN INDIAN 
S the sun came up out of the Atlantic on the twelfth of October, 1492, an un- 
A wonted bustle stirred aboard three small and somewhat weather-beaten Spanish 
ships pushing westward. Crews, plainly worried and surly, crowded the rails 
to discover what the watch had seen. For weeks the masts had bent before the steady 
trade winds blowing the boats farther and farther into the unknown ocean. For weeks 
the Spanish sailors had watched the western horizon with a growing dread of what 
monsters might be hidden behind it. There they saw on the morning of the twelfth a 
blurred spot in the slanting morning light. “Land!” was shouted from ship to ship. 
Superstitious fear relaxed into excitement. A little later, Columbus, clad in armor over 
which he had thrown the crimson robe of an admiral of Castile, with sword and banner 
in hand, stepped from the ship’s boat on to a sandy beach. There was a ceremony; 
he knelt and kissed the earth and took possession in the name of the Spanish king. A 
little knot of officers and men looked on, glad to have a chance to stretch their legs on 
shore and vaguely thrilled at the drama of the landfall. All, including the admiral, 
were ignorant of the true significance of the thing that had come to pass. 
Columbus, cruising amid the islands he had discovered, lost no time in searching out 
the people that he might learn where lived the mighty monarch for whom he bore a 
letter from the Spanish king. He did not find the cities that Marco Polo had said were 
in China and India but only a primitive people living in little villages of huts. It was a 
strange scene, that first meeting of the red and white races. Neither had any compre- 
hension of the identity of the other. Columbus thought the redmen Orientals and 
misnamed them Indians; no record has been left of the terrifying thoughts that passed 
through the minds of the natives as they gazed upon the beings that had come to their 
country. Scores of centuries stood between the white man and the chief with whom 
he tried to communicate and neither could cross the gulf. 
Columbus, setting out on his pioneering voyage, had left behind him a civilization 
that expressed itself in a Venice, a Divine Comedy or a Rheims cathedral, and in the 
New World had stumbled upon a primitive forest people. The Indian hunted his quarry 
and built his lodges and council fires amid the trees. He seemed to be the very child 
of the woods, his untutored impetuosity born of its wild life, his strength the fruit of 
centuries of conflict with the rough forces of nature, his gods articulate in the whistle of 
the winds in the evergreens. The rhythm of the wilderness beat in his ceremonies and 
dances. During the years when Europe saw the rise of Greece and Rome and later, the 
states of modern Europe, the redman in America remained little more than a forest 
hunter — in a land unsurpassed in climate and wealth of natural resource. The soil 
which was one day to make America the greatest of agricultural nations, he left uncleared. 
His squaw scratched it with a sharpened stick. The storehouses of mineral wealth that 
were to furnish the sinews of a later civilization the Indian never unlocked. For thousands 
of years destiny seemed to hold before him a priceless opportunity and he let it slip. 
Because of this failure to utilize the resources of his environment, the redskin has fre- 
quently been put down as belonging to an inferior race and as incapable of achieving 
1

  2 THE PAGEANT OF AMERICA 
civilization. In these later days, when scholarship has drawn the veil a little aside and 
men can look back over the long vista that marks the trail of human progress, the strange 
story of the Indian begins to appear. We can see now the catastrophe that cast its long 
shadow over practically the whole history of the red race in America. 
The Indian did not originate in America. Far back in the dim twilight, we can make 
out shapes moving eastward from Asia by way of the Bering Strait. We cannot see 
clearly what urged them on; we can only see them coming, making their way southward 
and spreading finally over the whole continent. The Indian plunged into the vast 
forest and found subsistence there; he ventured out on the broad grasslands, and followed 
the wandering herds of bison there. 
His people differentiated into a multitude of tribes speaking a multitude of languages. 
He threw away his early weapons of stone for new ones more beautifully and skilfully 
wrought. In places he dragged copper from its native bed and worked it. The prairie 
peoples who hunted the bison drew colored pictures, developed to a high state of per- 
fection, on the skin coverings of their tipis. In the forested valleys of the Ohio and the 
Mississippi, the early Algonquins built mounds of heroic proportions. The traveler of 
today may see them, one an almost perfect circle a thousand feet in diameter, another 
a serpent five hundred feet in length with writhing body, an elaborate head and a coiled 
tail. To the eastward, the tribes of the Iroquois built up a confederation worthy to be 
compared with many whose origin is better known, a piece of statecraft that withstood 
the shocks of more than two centuries, and then only collapsed when the white menace 
could be fought off no longer. Throughout his long racial history in America the Indian 
made progress. But the acme of his development came south of the Rio Grande. 
In Guatemala and the peninsula of Yucatan, partially sheltered from the attacks of 
invaders, the Mayas through many centuries developed a culture that, with its written 
language, crossed the boundary of civilization. During the centuries in which Rome 
was passing from the splendor of world empire to defeat at the hands of barbarian in- 
vaders, the Mayas were building great cities on the plains just back of the western shore 
of the Caribbean Sea. They erected truly noble temples of masonry, embellished with 
beautiful and effective sculpture. Beside these sanctuaries stood impressive mono- 
lithic monuments profusely carved. Maya astronomers calculated the calendar of the 
sun and the moon with an accuracy greater than that of their Roman contemporaries. 
Maya chroniclers set down the dates of the passing centuries in picture writing some- 
times chiseled in the temple wall, sometimes painted on it in polychrome designs and 
sometimes recorded on the paper pages of a book. But when the whites first stumbled 
upon the western continent, the civilized Mayas were gone. Gold-seeking Spaniards 
found in Yucatan the ruins of splendid cities, but the Indians who dwelt in the region 
did not live in them, and knew little or nothing of their origin. The Cross was set up; 
the Spaniard proclaimed a victory for Christendom. He had no time to speculate on 
ruins. 
But the man of a later day cannot escape the thought, as he pores over the remains 
of that vanished culture and pictures to himself the active, beauty-loving people who 
once worshiped in those temples: what would have been the history of the New World 
had that Maya civilization lived; had it spread northward, like the Roman culture in 
Europe, to the plains Indians, the mound-building Algonquins and the empire-building 
Troquois. What if Columbus had found in America the fabled seven cities and discovered 
the redman harnessing the mighty resources of the continent? But the Mayas passed
-P-A-G-E-11
  
THE AMERICAN INDIAN 3 
away. The Aztecs of Mexico and the Incas of Peru fell short of their achievements and, 
for the most part, the American Indians remained plains nomads or forest hunters. 
The culture of the Mayas is the high point in the race history of the Indian. It demon- 
strates beyond the shadow of a doubt the redman’s intellectual capacity to achieve civi- 
lization. It raises insistently the question, why did he not do so in that rich environment 
where in three centuries the white race created the modern United States of America. 
Much of the answer may be found in a catastrophe which occurred at the very beginning 
of the career of the red race on the continent of North America. 
In distant geologic ages before man appeared, North America became the home of 
a number of mammals, like the horse, the elephant and the camel, that were one day to 
be important factors in human progress. In those far-off days a land-bridge is believed 
to have bound Alaska to Siberia and another, stretching eastward from Labrador, spanned 
the north Atlantic. Over these, animals and plants migrated from continent to continent. 
At the height of the epoch of mammalian evolution, glaciers as broad as continents and 
thousands of feet deep moved out of the north, grinding their slow way southward in 
North America as far as the Ohio valley. The forests and grasslands gave place to a 
waste of ragged ice. Not once, but four times they came, and the land was green in the 
intervals. In one of these the first Indians probably came to America. Four times 
the wild creatures of America were inexorably pushed before the advancing ice sheets. 
Unable to withstand such colossal changes of climate practically all those animals which, 
like the elephant, the camel and the horse, were sufficiently tractable and intelligent to 
be domesticated, had either made their way to other continents or had perished. Just 
before the advance of the first glacier, the land-bridge across the north Atlantic had 
foundered. When the warm sun of a changing climate had driven northward the last 
of the ice sheets, Bering Strait joined the Pacific to the Arctic Ocean. America was 
isolated. 
It was a strange destiny that cut off the western continents from the rest of the world 
almost at the time when man first appeared upon them. The redman faced the long 
task of racial evolution with no source of power outside the human body to aid in sub- 
duing the natural environment. He did not accept the handicap without a struggle. 
He sought to domesticate all manner of beasts and birds; he tamed bears, deer, hawks 
and turkeys. The bison was too fierce and too stupid. With the exception of the dog 
and the llama and alpaca of the Andean highland, he failed. Even the city-building 
Mayas had no beasts to do their work or to augment their food supply. Living on 
the edge of the tropics, the Maya tribes could raise crops with a minimum of labor. 
But, without draught animals and the plows and carts that make the strength of such 
animals useful, the civilization of the Mayas was built upon an inadequate foundation. 
It crumbled apparently because of a slight change in the climate. Even more conspic- 
uously than among these Maya cities, the disaster of the Ice Age tied the hands of the 
Indian. He had no flocks of sheep or goats to furnish him with materials for weaving 
cloth, no herds of cattle to give him milk or hides or meat. He had no beasts of burden 
to haul his property or till his fields. All such beasts had perished as he was coming to 
North America. Had they been in America, doubtless he would have tamed them, for 
he found wild, food-bearing plants and domesticated them: gourds, beans, sunflowers, 
tobacco, corn. The gardens that the white men discovered beside the Indian villages 
were the fruit of thousands of years of intelligent effort. But half the value of this great 
achievement was lost because he had no beasts to aid him in the struggle for existence.

4 THE PAGEANT OF AMERICA 
He could never shake off his dependence upon wild animals for meeting part of the needs 
of life. He could not pass from the hunting to the agricultural stage of culture; he 
was caught between the two. No large population could grow up, no lasting civilization 
could be built upon so insecure a foundation. The achievement of the lost Mayas was 
merely the measure of how near to an impossible goal the redman came. 
Elements of tragedy may be found in this story of the American Indian. There was 
bitter irony in the destiny that put him so well equipped physically and mentally, yet 
with hands tied, in one of the richest environments of the world, and that spurred him 
on, ignorant of the disaster which blocked his progress, to make the best of a bad situa- 
tion. At the end, without warning, he was brought face to face with a more fortunate 
race which had achieved the civilization that he could not. The ancient law of life began 
to operate; a struggle developed; and the weaker race gave place to the stronger. The 
familiar hunting grounds, the garden plots, the graves of his ancestors were all obliterated. 
His fate even compelled him to be the tutor of his conquerors. They borrowed from him 
the American plants which he had domesticated and learned how they were raised; he 
taught them where to hunt and how to fish; from him the adventurers from the villages 
and cities of Europe learned the art of living in the forest. When the English had mastered 
it well enough to make their little coast settlement permanent, there began that cease- 
less westward pushing of the white frontier which was not to end until the Pacific had 
been reached and the Indian engulfed. For the redman, it meant that a futile racial 
struggle had been brought to a cruel end; for America, it signified that the culture of 
Europe was to be the culture likewise of the New World.

INDIANS.OF THE FOREST 
from Florida to Alaska. They touched the Pacific coast below the Aleutian Island 
chain, extended thence inland across the region of the Great Lakes to the Atlantic 
and stretched onward to the Gulf of Mexico. Yet this vast forest was not one uniform 
tract of woodland. There were coniferous trees in the north, deciduous areas in the 
middle, and evergreens in the extreme south. When Europeans first reached the Atlantic 
coast, they found many separate tribes of Indians living in villages scattered here and 
there throughout these woodlands. Though these tribes differed much in their modes 
of life, yet, because they lived in the forest and got their sustenance from it, they all 
had much in common and were thereby distinguished from the Eskimo and the Barren 
Ground peoples of the extreme north and from the tribes of the open plains and prairies 
to the west. 
The forest Indians were pre-eminently hunters, and deer was their principal game. 
In favorable regions they fished, but only as a supplement to the chase. Supplemental 
also were such attempts as they made at agriculture. The hunt was the most important 
task, and it was man’s work. Searching for berries, fruits, and edible roots fell to the lot 
of the women, as well as caring for the little garden plots near the lodges. 
The forest peoples, except for occasional pets, had no domestic animals but the dog, 
and it was only in the far north that they used him for draft or burden. They traveled 
on foot over forest trails or by canoe on forest-bordered streams. From the woods came 
their food, and the materials from which they made their clothing and habitations. The 
forest was their home, and its influence was felt in every phase of their life. [: prehistoric times the forests of North America spread in one continuous sweep

A TYPICAL FOREST INDIAN FAMILY 
In a forest that stretched down to the water’s edge, the Indian, strange and unexpected inhabitant of an 
unknown continent, faced the first white man to set foot on shore. Hunter, warrior and man of peace, held 
by circumstance to a culture far behind that of the new-comer, the redman marshalled all his experience 
and all his knowledge in an attempt to understand and appraise the new, strange people. And the Euro- 
pean, on his part, watching the native glide noiselessly among the trees or seeing him lounge about his squalid 
huts, dubbed him a savage, a noxious creature of the forest like the wolf or the wild cat, to be guarded 
against and ultimately exterminated.

JOHN WHITE’S INDIAN FIGURES 
Axout 1585 an Englishman, John White (or Wyth) by name, made a series of remarkable portraits repre- 
senting the Indians of Virginia and vicinity. The four drawings, done with the most careful attention to 
detail, represent (above) a woman and a chief, (below) an old man and a priest, in their ordinary garb; 
the first two with aprons of deerskin, the universal garment, the old man in a robe of dressed skin, and 
the priest with a cloak. Though all are barefoot, moccasins were frequently used by the Indians. 
Naturally the costume varied with the climate and the season of the year. Moreover, there were special 
costumes for ceremonial occasions. Nowhere among the forest Indians, however, did the garb attain the 
barbaric splendor to be found on the Western plains,

INDIAN TYPES BY JOHN WHITE 
Mosr picturesque of the figures in the Indian tribe was the magician, or medicine man, who claimed the 
magical power of communing with the spirits of another world. White drew him dancing according to 
the rites of his primitive religion, a bird charm on his head and a bag of charms in his girdle. So equipped, 
he fought off the evil spirits that lurked in air and earth and water. The equipment of the warrior was 
different, and his body was finely tattooed. The costume of the figure with the bowl may have been modi- 
fied by the artist, since the fringe shown belongs to a robe. The group of pictures gives a vivid idea of 
how the tribes from Virginia to Florida appeared: to the first explorers.

INDIAN COSTUME, 18TH CENTURY 
Tue Indians of the forest had no beasts of burden but carried their packs on their backs, partly supported 
by a strap passing over the forehead. To the women fell most of this labor, for the men must be left free 
to hunt and fight. The tribes to the north of Virginia needed more and heavier clothing to protect themselves 
against the sharp frosts of winter, when for many moons the snow lay white beneath the leafless trees. For 
the most part the skins of animals were used.

IN COLONIAL COSTUME 
WueEn the whites came, the redmen acquired new 
costumes of borrowed finery. Sometimes in gar- 
ments in which little of the aboriginal remained, 
they met their new and dangerous neighbors in 
solemn conclave, while at home among their 
fellows they wore the native garb. Yet every- 
where the coming of the Europeans wrought 
changes in costume, for the redman_ preferred 
the highly colored cloth of the trader, and for 
their own purposes the French and English com- 
peted in presenting to the chiefs shoes, fine uni- 
forms, and beads — gifts fraught with danger. 
This portrait, drawn in London, shows one of 
four Iroquois chiefs who were brought to Eng- 
land by Philip Schuyler in 1709. They were 
presented to the Queen and to the Archbishop of 
Canterbury who wrote them a Christian message. 
The costume may have been one provided in 
England or it may represent merely the artist’s 
fancy. 
FORTIFIED VILLAGES 
No Indian tribe could ever tell when war with a 
neighboring people might break out or when its 
braves might be called upon to defend the village 
against a hostile raid. Even before the whites came, 
the palisade had been developed»Jacques Le Moyne 
came to America about 1564, as a member of a 
little colony of French Huguenots planted in what 
was then known as Florida. When the Spanish wiped out the settlement, Le Moyne was among the few 
who escaped. His picture, drawn from intimate knowledge of the Florida peoples, shows the council

village, the sturdy stockade, 
and the fortified entrance 
which could be defended with 
ease. John White, a few 
years later, found and drew a 
imilar village in Virginia (see 
p- 29). The houses shown in 
both pictures were common 
to the eastern forests, each 
constructed with a frame- 
work of poles covéred with 
mats and bark. Close to the 
huts were the gardens of the 
Indians, and the surrounding 
forest was the tribal hunting 
ground.

AN IROQUOIS VILLAGE 
Tue Iroquois of the north, ablest of the eastern forest peoples, built habitations very like those in the south. 
On the Finger Lakes, as in the deepest valleys of the southern New York plateau, their shaggy villages were 
set in little clearings amid the trees. Within the stockades centered their work and their play. Here the 
hunter brought home his game, and here his squaw tended the hearth. Here children were born who would 
add to the strength of the tribe, and from here the dead were borne out to their final resting-place.

EverywHere within the eastern forests 
the bark huts of the Indians were much 
the same. Thatch was also in common 
use. Their chimneys were holes in the 
roof whence issued the smoke of the 
hearth fire and the odor of the meat, 
corn bread, and succotash.

A MINISINK VILLAGE, 1651 
Woop was the universal building material of the eastern forest Indians. Their culture had not advanced 
to a point where they were able to erect temples of masonry like the Aztecs in Mexico or the Mayas in 
Guatemala. Their only enduring monuments are the mounds of earth piled up in the Mississippi valley. 
The picture, a representation taken from an old map, shows the typical village surroundings of the Iroquois, 
who developed the greatest confederation among the eastern Indians. Such primitive habitations had no 
influence on the development of American architecture. 
  ERECTING A CHIPPEWA 
BARK LODGE 
To make a bark lodge, slender 
poles were planted in the ground, 
bent over, and tied. Sheets of 
bark were then added for the 
covering. Building the lodge 
was woman’s work. The drudg- 
ery of the camp was hers, but 
the tremendous exertion of the 
hunt and the dangers of battle 
fell to the man. The division 
of tasks was not unequal. Such 
flimsy habitations easily caught 
fire: Burning arrows to fire an 
enemy village were commonly 
used in war.

THE FOREST HUNTER 
Tue Indian was above all a hunter. When game failed, starvation stalked through the camp. Equipped 
with flint-tipped spears and arrows, the redman matched his wits and skill against the instincts and 
cunning of the birds and beasts. Moose and deer were especially difficult to kill, and a favorite device 
was to attack them in deep water.

CATCHING GAME 
Cuamp.ain’s record depicts 
two common devices of the 
forest hunters. In trails 
were set snares to be jerked 
up by a small tree bent over 
as a spring. A hunting 
party armed with devices 
for making a noise would 
beat through the woods 
stirring up the game and 
driving the animals before 
it. The deer were directed 
toward a fence and, as they 
leaped over it, were speared 
by hunters concealed be- 
hind. The spear made of a 
straight, strong shaft tipped 
with a sharp flint point was

STALKING DEER 
Tue bow and arrow were the chief dependence of the redskin in his pursuit of game. The development of 
this weapon was a triumph of inventive skill and was the product of an evolution running through many 
_generations. The bow and arrow had advantages over the crude matchlock which the first settlers brought 
to the American forest. The arrow sped silently on its mission. The weapon could be used many times in 
rapid succession. It was light and required no awkward rest for aiming. Oftentimes the white hunter 
adopted the Indian device. 
    , Voyages, Part II (Florida), , after a drawing by Jacques Le Moyne, Stalking game was practised by all the forest tribes. Dire necessity drove the 
Indian hunter to 
the quest of food 
and forced him 
to devise divers 
ways and means 
to secure his 
catch, for if he 
returned home 
empty-handed, 
there were many 
mouths that 
would go unfed. 
Sometimes he 
concealed him- 
self with skins. 
Patiently he 
watched by for- 
est paths and 
drinking places.

  RETURN OF THE HUNTER 
To a hunting camp of the Senecas, one of the Six Nations, 
the hunter returns successful. The women are preparing 
venison and dressing skins. To tan deerskins for clothing 
was a laborious process, and a woman’s standing among her 
people was gauged by the quality and number of skins she 
tanned. The smoked venison was dried on poles for the long 
cold months of winter, when the snow made hunting difficult 
and game scarce. The division of labor between the sexes 
made for greater economic efficiency within the tribe. 
FISHING 
In early days fish were abundant in the lakes and streams 
and in the inlets of the sea, and at times from convenience or 
necessity the forest Indians became fishermen. They used 
neat hooks of bone and spears with sharp bone points. Some 
tribes devised a three-pronged spear, like Neptune’s trident, 
which would catch and hold the fish securely. 
Some tribes made annual pilgrimages to the fishing grounds 
when the fishing season was on, just as they went on hunting 
trips in the autumn. Such seasonal migrations led many 
early observers to think that the forest Indians were nomadic. 
On the contrary, the activities of a village were normally 
confined to a restricted area.       18 From the sculpture by Louis Philippe Hébert een 1olyy for the Parliament building, awa,

     SHOOTING FISH 
Sometmes, where fish were abundant and the 
water clear, the Indian killed his fish as he did his 
game, with sharp arrows shot with practised aim. 
THE “MANNER OF FISHYNGE 
IN VIRGINIA ” 
Joun Wurre observed the fishing customs of 
the Virginia and Carolina natives. He noted the 
Indian weirs for guiding the fish into a trap, the 
spear, and the dugout in the midst of which a 
fire was often built on an earthen hearth to warm 
the fishermen and to cook the catch. All the 
practices in his faithful representation were cus- 
tomary on the Atlantic coast. But the Indians 
never ventured beyond the shallow waters im- 
mediately adjoining the shore. Unlike the Poly- 
nesians of the Pacific islands they developed no 
ocean-going canoes. The discovery of the cod 
banks off New England and Newfoundland was 
left to the whites.

A WORKSHOP OF THE IROQUOIS 
Tuere is a fascination in looking back across the intervening years at the simple yet’ busy life of the wild 
people who dwelt in forests that have long since given place to farms and cities. The scene is in the Iroquois 
country. In the midst a stoneworker chips out flint blades and arrowheads and grunts a tale to which the 
rest listen, while carrying on their own work. Another man finishes the hollowing of a wooden bowl. Two 
of the women are making skin clothing; one braids a pack strap from cords of twisted bark fibre, and another 
weaves baskets from wooden splints. Raw materials gathered from the forest are being transformed into 
things useful in the primitive life of the redman. Common enough were such scenes to the wandering traders 
and Jesuit missionaries.

THE CORN HARVEST 
Tur Indians were also farmers, and every village had its garden wherein corn was the chief crop. Corn meal 
and smoked and dried meat were the two staples of diet. To the women fell the work of husbandry, the 
preparing of the crops for storage, the grinding of the meal, and the cooking. For hundreds of years this 
simple life, unchanged by progress, had characterized the forest Indian.

In the villages of the Indians, rough

many industries were practised, for 
Indian life required the making 
of many things: clothing, tools, 
weapons, and stores of food pre- 
served for future use.

sents to a certain extent the work 
of all the forest Indians of the 
south: cooking, weaving, pounding 
and winnowing meal, dressing skins, 
and grating and pressing roots. The 
hammock and the grating and 
pressing are not typical of all the 
forest. tribes, but the method of 
weaving is. The warp was sus- 
pended from the limbs of trees or 
some other support. So far as is 
known, the forest Indians did not 
use a bar loom but wove downward. 
Cloth could not be made in this 
way, but only bags and soft baskets. 
Elsewhere in North America were 
Indian peoples who had perfected 
the art of weaving durable cloth 
ornamented with attractive designs.

  INDIAN ARROWMAKERS 
Cuxrura.y, the forest Indians lived in a stone age. 
Flint was the most useful, and boulders of this 
material were sought in bluffs of rivers and in other 
likely places. Fortunate indeed was the tribe that 
controlled a supply; not only were its weapons 
assured but it had a commodity of the greatest 
value to trade. Chunks were fractured from the 
native rock to be chipped later into knives, scrapers, 
or arrow points. The work of shaping the stone 
tools and weapons fell appropriately chiefly to the 
men. 
INDIAN FLINT QUARRIES 
One of the most extensive areas where the Indians 
excavated flint has been found in Ohio. From this 
multitude of pits came the raw material for count- 
less beautifully shaped arrowheads and spear points. 
“The ancient pittings cover hundreds of acres, 
and in numerous cases are still open to a depth of 
from 10 to 20 feet. About the pits are ridges and 
heaps of débris and many shop sites where the 
implement forms were roughed out, and masses 
of fractured flint and flakage, as well as countless 
hammerstones used in the shaping operations.” 
— W. H. Houmss, in Handbook of American Indians, 
Washington, 1912. 
We have come to think of the Indian almost 
entirely as a hunter and warrior. To walk among 
these pits and piles of debris is to realize what an 
important factor in the tribal life was the artisan.

CHIPPING FLINTS 
Tux first step in the process of turning 
the rough flint or chert as it came from 
the quarry into an arrow point or a 
knife was the shaping of the piece. 
Large flakes were struck off with a 
hammerstone until the crude outline 
of the final tool appeared.

sharpened by chipping with a bone point. 
This method is capable of trimming the edges 
of flakes or of blades already well advanced, 
but is apparently incapable of specialization of 
any other kind, unless, indeed, a sharp-edged 
rest is employed as shown above (No. 34). By 
this method it is possible to chip out notches 
of considerable depth, by reversing the piece to 
be chipped, from time to time.

GAMES OF FLORIDA INDIANS 
In archery the test of highest skill was to hit an arrow shot from the bow of another. Sometimes an arrow 
or a braid of grass was tossed up to be shot at. Foot races were common. The peculiar game shown here, 
with a basket on a pole, may be fanciful.

SPORT 
Tue Indians, like most primitive peoples, were 
fond of games, and old and young joined in 
the sports of the village. There were tests 
of skill and endurance which often provided 
a useful training for hunting and war. Archery 
and a kind of handball were common. The 
picture showing the ball and curved sticks 
is, no doubt, lacrosse, a favorite sport of the 
woodlands. The children’s games differed 
from those of the adults and consisted of 
top spinning, mimic fights and other imitative 
sports that were of use in their preparation 
  for the duties of later life. 40 From J. F, Lafitau, Maurs des Sauvages Amériquain: 
    
THE MOCCASIN GAME 
Games of chance were well known 
to the Indians, as to practically 
all primitive peoples, and gambling 
was often carried to excess. A 
favorite game was one in which 
the player concealed a bone or 
button in one of several moccasins, 
his opponents guessing its where- 
abouts. There were many vari- 
ations of this type of guessing 
game. The Indians represented 
— are of a later period. 
From W arcau of Mihnsloey, Washington, 1906, drawing by Ali Wright 
THE CHALLENGE 
Many of the old Indian fights were little more than raids or skirmishes. The redman’s code usually 
required the attacking tribe to notify its enemy. Sometimes the method was planting arrows secretly at 
night, or sometimes the sending . 
of a sheaf of arrows as the Nar- 
ragansett chief, Canonicus, did 
to the Pilgrims. Whatever the 
form, the symbolism and the 
hostile intent were clear. 
The Indians recognized two 
kinds of warfare; on the one 
hand, fighting for the protection 
of women and children, the 
home and the village, and, on 
the other hand, the going forth 
on expeditions to avenge in- 
juries or to take spoils.

THE LAST STAND 
Vator and heroism were the ideals of the forest Indian, 
and to die in battle was considered the best possible way to 
end life. When a war party was trapped, they seldom 
surrendered but fought on to the end. With the scalps of 
the vanquished as trophies, the victors returned to their 
village to be applauded by the old men and the women, 
while the forest echoed with the shrieks and howls of the 
victory dance. 45 
  THE ATTACK 
Tue forest Indians fought from 
the cover of trees. They had 
little military organization. The 
war chief directed the action in 
a general way, but an Indian 
battle was little more than a 
series of individual encounters. 
When a fortified village was 
assaulted, the attackers strove 
to fire the lodges and to drive 
the defenders into the open.

being made with flaming arrows 
in order to set fire to the houses 
within the palisade.

  THE SECRET SOCIETY 
Among the redmen of the northern forests was a 
secret society called Midewin. The initiation 
was an impressive occasion. A war party ap- 
proaches with scalps, asking to be initiated. A 
pole adorned with scalps is raised in the middle 
of an open space. The members of the society 
are seated about the outer wall awaiting the 
ceremony. Later a tribesman will show the 
candidates the sacred medicine bag. As they 
gaze upon the holy object, he will simulate the 
shooting of a small shell from the bag into their 
bodies and they will fall as dead. When revived, 
they will spit out shells upon the ground as proof 
that magic power has entered into them. 
PRISONERS OF WAR 
Many times when the fight was over or the 
enemy’s village captured, a group of unhappy 
prisoners followed the victors homeward — 
women and children to be adopted into the 
tribe of their successful adversaries, and warriors 
to be tortured or sometimes adopted. Torture 
was an accepted custom and was governed by 
code. Rarely did the Indian appear to better 
advantage than when he stood silent, immovable, 
victor over the anguish that his captors inflicted 
upon him. To die without a cry of pain was to 
achieve greatness.

THE CALUMET 
Ir the tomahawk was the symbol of war, the calumet 
stood for peace. The picture represents the peace 
ceremony between Bienville and the hostile tribes 
of Louisiana. 
“The peace calumet has a stem at least a foot 
and a half long; it is adorned with the skin of the 
neck of a duck, ‘branchu’ (?) — whose plumage of 
many different colors is very beautiful —at the 
end is a bowl. At the same end is fastened a sort 
of fan made of the feathers of a white eagle, a 
quarter of a circle in form, at the end of each feather 
is a tuft of ‘poit’ or bright red. The other end of the 
stem is uncovered to allow for smoking.” So wrote 
Bienville of the pipe he saw. Inevitably when a formal 
meeting occurred between members of different tribes 
the calumet passed from hand to hand. It was sol- 
emnly puffed by each person. This ceremony was one 
of the most impressive of the Indian formalities. 
AN IROQUOIS COUNCIL HOUSE 
Many symbolic terms borrowed from the Iroquois 
have enriched our language, as the “council fire,” 
“keeper of the wampum,” “the sachem,” “burying 
the hatchet,” etc., and here we have a glimpse of 
the council at work. The young man at the right 
is a messenger ready to carry the belt of wampum 
that may mean peace or war, as the case may be. 
Every Indian village throughout the forest land had 
some kind of a building in which the older men and 
sometimes the women also met to exercise the func- 
tions of government. Its usual place was in the 
center of the village.

INDIANS OF 
VILLAGE CEREMONIES 
Truty remarkable in its comprehension is this 
representation of Indian village life. The redman 
felt compelled to adjust himself to the requirements 
of two worlds — that which he saw and touched 
and heard about him, and the invisible world of 
the spirits mingling with the other as the mist 
mingles with the air. The Elizabethan draftsman 
has caught this dual aspect of the Indian life. 
The cornfields with the shelter for the watcher 
who scared away the birds, the hunters returning 
through the forests, the lodge with the beds for 
sleeping, the fire for cooking and warmth, and the 
cooked meal ready for eating, all portray the red- 
man’s adjustment to the material world. 
But fittingly in the foreground are the tomb of 
the dead chieftain, the fire which is the “place of 
solemne prayer,” and a religious dance about posts 
carved with faces. Here mortal man comes close to 
the world of the spirits and adjusts himself to their 
requirements. 
THE FALSE FACE CEREMONY 
Retiaious practices developed among the Indians as 
the years passed. No false face ceremony was known 
among the Iroquois until about 1700, when the 
custom shown appeared. Without warning, men 
with wooden masks burst into the lodge. One 
addresses a boy or girl; the other takes up ashes 
from the hearth. In a moment they are gone, and are 
entering the next lodge. They. are driving the evil THE FOREST 29

IROQUOIS GRAVES 
Tue most common method of burial among the forest Indians was in a grave. Sometimes the grave 
was in a mound raised above the surrounding earth. Sometimes it was merely a pit or even a cave. 
Among some peoples the graves were lined with stones, with a stone roof to keep the earth from falling 
in upon the body. With the dead were interred the things that he had used and prized in life — his 
bow and arrow and spear, his pottery utensils, his amulets and perhaps the decorations that he wore. 
With unquestioning faith the redman believed that the grave was the beginning of a new life to be 
lived after the ancient manner of the tribe. So, with solemn ceremony, the departing warrior was 
given the things necessary to meet the needs of the existence beyond death. 52 From a model in the State Museum, Albany 
INDIAN RELIGION 
Tuts world of ghosts was the basis of the Indian’s religion, and religion was a powerful factor in his life. It 
prescribed long ceremonies which were carried out with meticulous care for detail; it laid down strong 
taboos. It was one of the most 
important disciplinary factors in 
his life. Closest to the spirit 
world was the medicine man, 
who was usually a juggler and 
kept close-guarded tricks which 
his fellow tribesmen could not 
comprehend.

  DEATH AND MOURNING 
Deatx to the redman meant a passing over to the 
spirit world. In his dreams sometimes an Indian saw 
one who had died and talked with him; therefore, he 
reasoned, the dead must live. The land of spirits was 
not far away but close at hand, about the very village 
which the departed had known so well. The things of 
the new life were like the old, save that the spirit of the 
dead had become more powerful than in life and 
capable of doing greater mischief to those who re- 
mained. Sometimes the house of a dead man was 
burned for fear that he would molest another who 
used it. For the same reason relatives cut their hair 
and disfigured themselves to escape recognition. 
A ceremony of lamentation at the grave honorably 
ushered the dead man into the new life pleased with 
hisAormer friends and not angry at any want of 
respect. Moreover, the Indians, in spite of frequent 
representations to the contrary, were an emotional 
people. It was part of their code to stand unmoved 
in the face of torture by an enemy. From childhood 
they were trained to this form of self-control. But 
beyond this they gave vent to their feelings without 
restraint. So they mourned the death of friend or 
relative.

AN INDIAN TOMB 
Ir a chieftain died, his power as a spirit was regarded as 
in proportion to his influence in life. John White, the Eng- 
lish traveler, found among some southern Indians this sepulchre 
for their great men. The bodies were prepared according to 
savage custom. Beside them sat a wooden image to guard 
them through the passing years. 
Under the “scaffolde some one of their priests hath his 
lodginge, which Mumbleth his prayers night and day, and 
hath charge of the corpses. For his bedde he hath two deares

AN ALGONQUIN BURYING GROUND 
Inp1An burial customs varied considerably among the different 
tribes. Many times bodies were put in trees or, as in the 
picture, upon scaffolds. Wolves and other carrion-eating ani- 
mals could not disturb the remains and hence cause displeasure 
to the spirits of the departed. Precautions were taken against 
depredations by the birds. Such a burying ground was a 
sacred place to the people of the tribe. What would the 
spirits think if it came into the hands of the white invaders? 
The Indian must fight desperately to ward off such a fate.

PROPHET’S LODGE °°. From the original drawing by John White, 585, in the British Museum 
Amone the tribes around the Great Lakes were seers who 
shut themselves in a tubular lodge and performed incanta- 
tions. ‘The medicine man had magic formulae and magic 
implements which gave him control over the spirits. He fell 
into trances and communed with them. In this sacred se- 
clusion of the tubular lodge the medicine man spoke to the 
spirits above the lodge and brought to his solemn questioner 
a knowledge gained from the world beyond the grave. Not 
all the spirits, however, were ghosts of the dead. There 
were spirits of animals, particularly the tribal totem animal. 
There were spirits everywhere about the living, in trees and 
stones, in streams and the whistling wind. The circle of 
darkness about the evening fire was full of them.

THE SUN WORSHIPPERS 
Prruars the Indian’s religion seems to us today to be crude and packed with superstitions. The same, 
however, is true of all primitive religions out of which our finer faiths have developed. Yet it was a power- 
ful agency for good among the tribes. It disciplined the savage and taught him the folly of depending solely 
upon his own strength. It explained for him the strange and terrifying things of life and calmed his fears 
with the belief that, if he performed certain ceremonies or wore certain amulets, he would be safe. After 
all, comfort, hope, and the sense of a power, greater than himself, with whom he could communicate — the 
elements of religion — were there.

INDIANS OF THE PLAINS 
P HE forest mantle in which the forest Indians lived stretched across what is now 
| central Canada from the Rocky Mountains to Labrador and then extended 
southward along the Atlantic coast plain and the Appalachian mountains to 
the Gulf of Mexico. Climate made some differences but, in general, the Indians of this 
vast wooded area were much alike. Quite different were the tribes dwelling in the grass- 
covered plains in the center of the continent. Bounded on the west by the towering 
Rockies, extending northward to the Saskatchewan river and almost to Lake Winnepeg, 
reaching eastward as far as the Illinois river and southward almost to the Nueces in 
Texas lay a country in which trees were rarely found. Here grazed vast herds of bison 
and multitudes of prairie dogs dug their burrows. Packs of wolves ranged the plains 
seeking their prey and coyotes howled through the nights. In this environment dwelt 
the plains Indians. 
They differed from their forest neighbors because their surroundings were different 
and because, as a result, their whole mode of living was different. Yet they belonged 
to the same race and, like the forest Indians, had not progressed beyond the neolithic 
stage of culture. In general the Indians of the plains were a vigorous, capable people. 
There were few weakling tribes. These had been driven off the low country in the fierce 
competition of the bison hunters and many of them had taken refuge in the sheltered 
recesses of the mountains. Like the forest Indians, the peoples of the plains, while 
divided into many tribes and speaking a number of languages, belong to a common 
group because the way of life was essentially the same from Texas to the Saskatchewan. 
In 1832-34, a German scientist, Maximilian, Prince of Wied-Neuwied, left behind 
him the frontier of the young United States, which had barely crossed the Mississippi, 
and worked his way up the Missouri to its headwaters. Week after week he journeyed 
through the country of the plains and the bison, home of the plains Indian, who was as 
yet scarcely touched by the influence of the white. Maximilian took with him Carl 
Bodmer, an artist who left posterity a priceless heritage of Indian portraits and pictures.

INDIANS OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS 
Tue Indians of the plains differed in costume from their brothers of the forest. They dressed their hair 
differently, and for their clothing they depended almost solely upon the bison. The hide took the place 
of cloth, while bones and horn furnished ornaments. With rare accuracy Bodmer has depicted the charac- 
teristics not only of the Indian’s dress but of his countenance. In the upper picture from left to right are 
represented a Blood, a Piegan and a Kootenay; in the lower, a Missouri, an Oto and a Ponca (Poncha).

were the women so gaudily dressed as the young men. The 
women were the drudges. Their work was about the lodges, 
cooking and preparing the game which the men took, striking 
and making camp and carrying the luggage when the tribe 
moved. Their status was not so high as among peoples who 
have passed to the agricultural stage of development.

STALKING THE HERD 
Tue old trick of stalking in disguise brought down many a beast. Concealed under the skin of a wolf or 
a coyote, the hunter crept up on the herd. Such a method was fraught with grave risk, for a buffalo could 
be a dangerous animal at close quarters. The Indian and his family, however, must live. If a man were not 
skilful enough to bring down his game, he had better lose his life, for he was of little value to the tribe.      Chasse Generale au Boeuf

Atmost the whole econ-

animals, such as ante-

caught, but they were 
of small consequence in

son. In the days before 
the horse, the fleet ante- 
lope and the fierce and 
wary bison presented 
difficult problems to the

methods of the old days.

Arter the herd had been sighted by the advance scouting party, a council of the leaders was held to work 
out a plan of approach that would give each hunter a good chance. When all was ready, the word was given 
and the onslaught began. Then it was that the skill and prowess of the individual were brought into play, 
and he succeeded or failed as a result of his own efforts.

BISON HUNTING IN WINTER

him swiftly and safely over the surface.

DEVICES FOR CATCHING 
WILD ANIMALS 
Tue “buffalo pound” was an early 
device. The pound itself was roughly 
fifty feet on a side and was built of 
trees piled up to a height of five feet. 
At the entrance was thrown up a 
bank of earth with a gradual incline, 
up which the animals were to be 
driven. The inner part of the wings 
was formed of trees or bushes; the 
outer part by men lying on the ground 
under buffalo skins, each holding a 
stick aloft. 
“Every preparation being made, 
three or four men set off on foot to 
find a herd of cows, for the bulls they 
think not worth their trouble. These 
they drive easily along till they arrive 
within the vicinity of the pound, 
when one man is dispatched to give 
notice to the other Indians, who 
immediately assemble on horseback 
on each side of the herd, keeping a 
proper distance for fear of frightening 
the animals. By this means the herd 
is brought within the exterior line of 
poles. 
“Tt frequently happens that they 
will go out, to prevent which the men

none will make their escape.” —UMFREVILLE, Present State of Hudson’s Bay, London, 1790.

THE HAZARD OF THE HUNT 
Tur life of the man who lived by the chase was full of peril. The bison was a fierce though stupid animal 
and fought, when brought to bay, with a deadly ferocity. His bulk and speed and the sharp horns with which 
he was equipped demanded of the Indian the best of horsemanship. More terrible still was the grizzly, 
hunted where the plains merged into the mountains. The qualities which made for success in such a life 
developed that courage and firmness which made the redman of the plains one of the greatest of Indian 
warriors.

THE ADVANCE GUARD OF A BLACKFOOT HUNTING PARTY 
Tue hunting of the bison developed in the plains Indian a capacity for effective co-operation not often found 
in the redman of the forest. He was compelled to organize. In the hunt different persons did different 
things. Such habits of organization stood the redman in good stead when attacked by his enemies. 
CATCHING WILD HORSES 
Horses escaped from the first Spanish expeditions. Thus began the wild herds which were soon to 
become an important 
element in the In- 
dian life of the plains, 
for the hunters soon 
became skilful in cap- 
turing, in taming, and 
in riding these horses. 
Catlin’s picture shows a 
capture of a wild horse 
in true Indian fashion 
made by a half-breed in 
the party with which the 
artist was crossing the 
plains. The advent of 
the horse suddenly and 
profoundly changed the 
Indian’s mode of life.

  DRESSING SKINS 
Tue proper dressing of skins was an art in which the Indian excelled. The fresh skin was first stretched out 
on the ground, hair-side down, fleshed and dried. If to be fully dressed, it was then turned over and the 
hair was scraped away. If a robe was to be made, the skin was treated to a softening process and was some- 
times stretched on a frame.

INDUSTRIES, UTENSILS, AND ARMS 
Many of the things that the Indians of the plains made were exceedingly well wrought. Like the redmen 
of the forest they used weapons and tools of stone, but they were particularly adept in the use of skins. 
There was a certain dash of ornamentation that set their work off from that of their forest brothers.

VILLAGE OF THE EASTERN DAKOTA 
Some of the Dakota Indians near the forest line in Minnesota and Wisconsin made occasional use of bark 
cabins. “The summer houses of the Dacotas are made of the bark peeled from trees. The building of the 
house is the work of the women. . . . For these houses the bark of the elm tree is principally used. There 
is a quantity of this sort in the Sioux country. In the spring, the bark peels off easily in large pieces. The 
women have only to plant poles in the ground, fasten the bark to them, and the summer house is soon 
made. In the roof there is a hole cut that answers the purposes of a chimney. The fire in a Sioux or 
Dacota lodge is always kindled in the centre. A place in the lodge is allotted to each member of the 
family. The wife has hers near the door; being servant as well as wife, she is by custom placed where 
she can conveniently go in and out. The husband has his place near the fire.”” — Mrs. Mary H. Eastman. 
  
MANDAN VILLAGE 
Excepr during the summer hunt of the 
bison, some of the tribes along the 
Missouri lived in oval, dome-shaped 
houses covered with earth. Frames or 
stages were erected upon which meat 
and food were dried, out of the reach 
of dogs and horses. For crossing the 
river a curious boat was used, made by 
stretching a fresh buffalo skin over a 
basket-like framework of poles. These 
boats were later used somewhat by the 
trappers and fur traders who ventured 
into the Indian region. They were soon 
discarded for they capsized easily and 
were difficult to steer. The habitations 
of the Mandans differed from those of

A TRIBAL CAMP 
As herds of bison moved from place to place in search of pasture, the Indians of necessity followed them. 
In the plains, during the summer months, a whole tribe was often organized as a moving cavalcade, striking 
its tents at command and pitching them again at night, perhaps in some sheltered valley where the adjoining 
grassland promised good hunting. In the picture can be seen the form of the camp and the life of the people — 
the women engaged in their daily routine, the hunters returning with game, and the warriors lounging about, 
ready for any alarm.

THE DOG AND THE HORSE 
Berors horses came, the Indian of the plains traveled on foot accompanied by dogs bearing the lighter parts 
of his baggage. Even tent poles were dragged by the dogs and sometimes they carried the babies as well. 
Such a use of dogs was not possible in the forest. After horses came, following the establishment of the 
Spanish colonies, they also were trained to draw the travois and the tent poles.

INCIDENTS OF A COMANCHE MARCH 
“TI sHoutp also have given the reader, a sketch of one of these extraordinary scenes, which I have had the 
good luck to witness. . . . Each horse drags his load, and each dog, i.e. each dog that will do it (and there 
are many that will not), also dragging his wallet on a couple of poles; and each squaw with her load, and all 
together (notwithstanding their burthens) cherishing their pugnacious feelings, which often bring them into 
general conflict, commencing usually amongst the dogs, and sure to result in fisticuffs of the women; whilst 
the men, riding leisurely on the right or the left, take infinite pleasure in overlooking these desperate conflicts, 
at which they are sure to have a laugh, and in which, as sure never to lend a hand. 
“These people, living in a country where buffaloes are abundant, make their wigwams more easily of 
their skins than of anything else; and with them find greater facilities of moving about, as circumstances 
often require; when they dtag them upon the poles attached to their horses, and erect them again with 
little trouble in their new residence.” — GrorGE Catuin.

Tue reception of a guest was a

I FORT UNION ON THE MISSOURI 
Tue whites, as they worked their way westward across the forest country, pushed their trading-posts out 
into the plains. Fort Union was built by the American Fur Company in 1829, near the spot where the 
Yellowstone enters the Missouri. Bodmer, to whom we owe this picture, saw it five years later. Power- 
fully built and well armed, it furnished a place where the trader could deal in safety with the plains people. 
Within the inner quadrangle were the residences of the interpreters and clerks, the stores and supplies of 
goods for trade, the skins that had been received in barter, and rooms for receiving and entertaining the 
Indians. In such strongholds the frontier civilization of young America met the barbarian of the plains.

TRIALS OF AN INDIAN TRADER 
Tue life of a trader was full of trials and critical incidents. The wild Indians were often difficult to keep 
within bounds. Surprise attacks had to be balked with readiness and cunning matched with cunning. 
Experience taught the trader to sleep with one eye open and to be ready for anything. 
SIGNALS 
Picture writing was one way of communicating among the Indians. The great distances of the open 
country required signals of several kinds. Perhaps an enemy was in the offing; perhaps there were wild 
horses and the distant tribe must be given the information. When the Ponchas or Omahas discovered 
bison the watcher 
stood erect on a hill, 
with his face toward 
the camp, holding his 
blanket with an end 
in each hand, his 
arms being stretched 
out (right and left) 
on a line with his 
shoulders. The sig- 
nals of the plains 
Indians were an ad- 
justment to the vast 
treeless grasslands 
whose slightly undu- 
lating surface often 
hid the animals which 
the redskin sought as 
prey.    94 From Col. Garrick Mallery, Ston ramet among North American Indians, in Annual earoril 1879-80, ureau of Ethnology, Washington, 1881

PICTURE WRITING 
— LONE DOG’S 
WINTER COUNT 
Tue writing of the plains 
Indians was made up of 
pictures, and in this way: 
they could convey much 
information. The heroic 
deeds of a warrior were 
inscribed upon his buffalo 
robe or on the walls 
of his tipi. Everyone 
would then know what 
degree of recognition to 
give him. The pigments 
were mineral in origin, 
* mixed with water and 
applied with a stick. 
The picture represents 
acalendar of the Dakotas 
covering the years from 
1799 to 1870. The nar- 
rative begins at the right 
of the center and goes 
outward in a spiral. The 
first entry consists of 
three rows of lines which 
indicate that in 1799 
thirty Dakotas were 
killed by the Crows. In 
the following year small- 
pox broke out, as shown 
by the dotted human 
figure. The story of the 
tribe unfolds in order: 
the Dakotas stole horses 
with shoes; they stole 
horses with curly tufted 
hair; they had a medi- 
cine dance and went to 
war, as shown by the 
pipe stem ornamented 95 From United States Bureau of Ethnology Annual Report, 1882-83 
by feathers; Crow In- 
dians killed eight Dakotas; a Dakota killed an Arikara, as he was about to shoot an eagle; Chief Red 
Coat was killed; and so on through the years. 
The last three entries, made in the years when the armies of the United States were beginning to move 
against the people of the plains, represent the bringing of Texas cattle to the Dakota country, the eclipse 
of the sun in 1869, and an attack by the Dakotas on a Crow fort. Perhaps in no better way than in this 
simple story of the great events in tribal history can people of a different day and culture catch a glimpse 
of what life meant to the Indians of the plains. 
Living in the region which still bears their name, the Dakotas, the main tribe of the Sioux, were the 
greatest, physically, mentally and probably morally, of the plains Indians. Their bravery was unquestioned. 
Their form of government was superbly adapted to the needs of their life. Their chiefs, chosen for fitness 
rather than by heredity and limited in power by the Band Council of the tribe, led their warriors to 
victory after victory until every rival except ithe Chippewas had been driven from their hunting range.

THE SIGN LANGUAGE 
As there were many tribes 
on the plains, so there were 
many languages and dialects. 
The frequent contact of tribe 
with tribe made some sort of 
common language necessary 
and the sign language grew 
up as an adaptation to the 
peculiar conditions in the 
open country. The Indian 
on the rock in the distance 
asks, “Who are you?” by 
raising the right hand, palm 
in front, and slowly moving 
it right and left. Answer is 
made with, say, the tribal sign 
for Pawnee. The sign for peace 
is made by the Indian laying 
down his weapons and raising 
his hands high above his 
head. In such ways the tribe 
from the headwaters of the 
Missouri could communicate 
with a people from the Rio 
Grande for the sign language was a universal language of the plains.

WAR 
Rovine from place to place as 
they followed the bison, the 
tribes of the plains came fre- 
quently into contact and con- 
flict with one another. Early in 
Indian history the weakling 
tribes were driven from the open 
places to the shelter of rough 
mountain valleys, and the fierce 
and warlike tribes were left to 
dominate the grasslands. As 
the tribe was organized for the 
hunt, so it was organized for 
war. Skilful horsemen and 
courageous fighters, the Indians 
of the plains left a rich heritage 
of tales of heroism and fortitude. 
This oral tradition, however, has 
been mostly lost because the 
Indians could not write and what 
records they left are wordless.

INDIANS IN A FIGHT 
From the walls of Fort Mackenzie, in the background, Bodmer in August, 1833, saw this fight. A band 
of Blood Indians, come to trade, fought an enemy tribe outside the stockade. The fierce and bloody charac- 
ter of the hand-to-hand struggle is vividly portrayed. Even in the midst of the fray the warrior takes time 
to strip off a scalp. Both sides hastily remove the wounded. The affair is soon over, but it leaves the 
rankling enmity of the blood feud.

INDIANS DISGUISED AS BUFFALO 
In the open plains country a scout could not conceal himself in a tree or in the underbrush at the crest of a 
hill, for when he climbed to a high point for observation, his figure would be silhouetted against the sky. So 
ingenious devices were used to disguise the scout. Sometimes, concealed by skins, he stalked the buffalo 
or crept close to an enemy.

THE WOUNDED 
In every war the wounded 
present a problem. “If it is a 
long distance to go home from 
the field of battle, a litter is pre- 
pared to carry the wounded. 
The warriors take two poles, 
having a blanket or buffalo skin 
fastened to them, so as to form 
a sort of cot, upon which the 
wounded man is placed. An 
Indian at each end raises the 
poles, and, by means of a strap 
tied to the ends and thrown over 
his shoulder, he is enabled to bear 
it for miles before resting. Two 
Indians can thus transport a 
    wounded man from thirty to forty i os i 5 A i ti oe a 
miles a day.” —M.H. EastMan. 101 From M. H. Eastman, Amertcan Aboriginal Portfolio, 1853, engraving after the drawing by Seth Eastman’ 
  BADGES OF HONOR 
A FEATHER in the head stood for a deed 
according to its marking: “an eagle’s feather 
with a red spot denotes that the wearer has 
killed an enemy, a notch cut in it and edges of 
the feather painted red, indicates that the 
throat of an enemy has been cut. Small 
consecutive notches on the front side of the 
feather without paint, denote that the wearer 
is the third person that has touched the dead 
body. Both edges notched, that he is the 
fourth person that has touched it; and the 
feather partly denuded, that he is the fifth 
person that has touched the slain. The split 
feather denotes that the wearer has received 
scars from the hand of an enemy. The feather 
clipped off, and the edges painted red, are 
also indicative of the cutting of an enemy’s 
throat.” — H.R. Scnootcrarr. When painted 
on robes or tipis, human figures with heads 
represent the number of prisoners taken; those 
without heads, the number of killed, adults 
and children. Hands and birds vary much 
in their meanings. So the Indian brave, like 
the modern soldier in full regalia, displayed 
the history of his achievements in his costume. 
His status in the community was largely de- 
pendent upon his record.

THE BULL DANCE 
War led to advancement in the secret societies which were part of the tribal organization. The Indians of 
the plains developed societies that were very elaborate. The young men joined the lowest society and, 
passing from rank to rank, might eventually as old men reach the highest, the Bull Society. At stated times 
each organization brought out its regalia and gave its dance in public. The picture shows a ceremony of 
the Mandan Bull Society. Very impressive to adolescent youth was this ceremony of the veteran warriors. 
Eagerly they looked forward to the time when they should earn the right to share in the secrets and 
mysteries of the great society. 
  
THE SCALP DANCE 
WHEN a war-party re- 
turned to camp successful ~ 
over their adversaries, the 
women celebrated their 
  exploits with the scalp 
dance. The warrior who 
had brought back a scalp 
gave it to his wife or 
sweetheart to carry in 
the ceremony. Other tro- 
phies, such as captured 
war-bonnets, were worn. 
The wild excitement of 
the battle was transmuted 
into the savage rhythm 
of the dancing.

DEATH 
SELF-CONTROLLED as he was in the face of 
danger and suffering, the Indian was at heart 
strongly emotional. Emotion permeated his 
wild dances and filled his religious cere- 
monies, but it was never more marked than 
when he stood in the presence of death. 
Sometimes the relatives, gathering about 
the lifeless form of one who had gone, would 
call upon him, reproach him for leaving 
them, vow vengeance on his enemies, and 
exaggerate his virtues. Sometimes they 
would cut off their hair, lacerate their 
limbs, and tear their clothing already crimson 
with their. own blood. 
Rolled in a skin or blanket, the body 
would be placed with gentle solemnity upon 
a scaffolding to keep it away from the 
wolves. By it were placed food and water, 
to be frequently replenished as the birds 
hovering around consumed the supply. 
Then all repaired to the preparation of 
one of their most solemn feasts. Sometimes 
the bereaved wife would carry a bundle rep- 
resenting the husband, and night and morn-     ing she would wail in solitary places.

THE MEDICINE MAN 
Tue medicine man was both priest and doctor 
to his people. Called to the bedside of the sick, 
he brought his sacred rattle and his sacred medi- 
cine bag. It might be that, according to their 
simple belief, some animal had entered the body 
of the victim and was eating away his vitals. 
If so, the medicine man made a little bark image 
of the animal and directed the young men to 
shoot it. Perhaps the water-spirit had frowned 
on the sick one or the thunder-birds were angry 
with him; perhaps a medicine man or a woman 
of another clan hated him and was holding over 
him the evil eye. 
All of these things the medicine man considered 
and prepared to counteract. Nothing was left 
- undone. He shook his rattle with howls and 
grunts and groans. He crawled on hands and 
knees and made frightful faces. Suddenly chang- 
ing, he would begin a slow and solemn chant. 
Sometimes he gave the patient a magic potion, 
which often had real medicinal value. His pur- 
pose in all these operations was to drive out the 
evil spirit that was troubling the sick one.

THE CALL TO THE GREAT 
MYSTERY 
Ar least once in his life the Indian of the 
plains alone made an offering and suppli- 
cated the Great Unknown to show Him- 
self, to speak to his poor child, to give 
him faith and courage to be a man. The 
more religious did this many times during 
their lives. Bodmer caught the spirit of 
these tense moments in picturing an 
Indian out alone in the gathering gloom, 
where he had set up an altar and an 
offering. 
Sometimes the suppliant fasted and 
prayed for four days, or even longer, until 
he was granted a vision or heard the voice 
of the Great Mystery, giving him a 
formula by which his life was to be guided 
in the future.

they swooned or received a vision. This latter experience caused them to be regarded as holy men and

  A HUPA INDIAN FAMILY, CALIFORNIA 
West of the plains lay the Rockies and beyond them a wilderness of jagged mountains and arid plateaus. 
Almost on the edge of the Pacific was the rich valley of California. Through all this country Indians lived, 
the wretched Utes of the Central Basin and the primitive tribes of the coast. In the desert of Arizona and 
New Mexico the Pueblos built their great communal houses. Further south, in Mexico, were the Aztecs 
and, beyond their country, the ruins of the vanished culture of the Mayas. 
Nature has given California a great diversity of climate and topography — mountains and lowlands, 
forests, plains and deserts. Indian life varied with these; some tribes wandered over the plains country 
and others were isolated in little mountain valleys. There were more different languages here than in any 
other part of the country. The Hupa lived in the north in the rough and forested country.

Tue old prints illustrate the uses of baskets among the Indians of California. As they made no pottery, there 
were no other vessels. It is hard to realize that many of these finely woven baskets were cooking pots. Stones 
were heated and then dropped in to make the contents boil. The pictures illustrate basket-making (No.

THE DIGGER INDIANS 
In eastern California the Indians made extensive use of edible roots, and as they were everywhere seeking 
or these and grubbing, they were called “Digger.” Like other California tribes, they gather and store 
acorns from which they make meal for baking into bread. A storage platform stands on the right of the 
lodge. No doubt these dwellings have been modified by contact with whites but are still primitive in form.

NAVAJO HOGANS 
Tue house of the Navajo is called a hogan, made by setting up logs and covering them with earth. The 
Navajos are an agricultural people whose life differs profoundly from that of the former nomadic hunters of 
the plains. Their culture stands between that of the tribes to the north of them and that of the old Aztecs 
and Mayas on the south. The Spaniards brought sheep to the Navajo and taught them to be shepherds. 
Then they learned to weave the unique blankets now so familiar.

In New Mexico and Arizona one may still see the villages of the Pueblos. They were first described by

  ROOM IN A ZUNI HOUSE 
Eacu room in a pueblo house was the home of a family. Agriculture was highly developed, so that these 
Indians depended upon their fields rather than upon hunting. The country was dry, but they understood 
irrigation. They also domesticated the turkey. The Zuii, still living in their ancestral home, are a 
quiet, industrious people who still cling tenaciously to their ancient religion.

THE CEREMONIAL SNAKE DANCE OF THE MOQUIS 
Tue religions of the Indians of the south- 
west were filled with the same nature wor- 
ship and spirit fear that characterized the 
beliefs of their neighbors on the plains. 
The Moqui snake dance is one of the more 
striking of the dramatic ceremonies of the 
Indian worship. “The striking features of 
the complicated secret rite are the gather- 
ing of snakes from the world-quarters, the 
making of the sand altar, the snake washing, 
the snake drama, and the races which occur 
on the mornings of the days of the public 
‘dance’ of the Snake fraternity.” — WaLTER

Tus is the last actin the Moqui snake

whole ceremony continues for nine days, 
and this running figure typifies the last 
moment of the dance when the snakes are 
being returned to the snake clan that handles 
the snakes. This Moqui has grabbed a 
bunch of them and is off down the mesa at 
top speed, speeding out to the four points 
of the compass to deposit the snakes in 
their desert home.

fighting fleet of Venice, burned the bulk of it, and sailed the rest triumphantly 
home overloaded with captives. Among them was a Venetian gentleman who had of |: the year 1298, the jails of the little seaport town of Genoa were bulging with 
late achieved some notoriety because he had recently returned from a long sojourn in 
China and because he told tales of that far-off country which were beyond the wildest 
imaginings of medizeval Europeans. Waiting in prison for the feud between the rival 
commercial cities to be settled, Marco Polo turned his tales into one of the most famous 
books of travel of all time. In its pages his fellows caught a glimpse of a civilization 
older and, in some respects, more advanced than their own. There were canals and rivers 
in Cathay full of boats, and great cities teeming with population. There was a powerful 
emperor, Kublai Khan, presiding over a rich and luxurious court. Men looked up 
from Polo’s pages at the bare walls of feudal castles; at fortified trading towns; at kings 
struggling to found small nations, England, France. There were more silks and spices, 
more gold and silver and precious stones in China and India than in all of Europe. Polo 
set men to coveting the luxuries of the Orient, and the trade that had already sprung 
up increased. 
Between the East and the West lay that vast, sub-arid plateau of central Asia which 
Polo had crossed and whence fierce, fighting tribes had more than once come into China, 
India and Europe. West and East were developing, each in its own way and in ac- 
cordance with the needs of its own life. Europe’s culture was the youngest but within 
it lurked a discontent and vigor that the others lacked. Its life, though somewhat 
crude, was running full and strong, while that of China and India was passing into quiet, 
perhaps stagnant, pools. China, rich in herself and close to India, had bred a race of 
landsmen, but Europeans, from the time of early Phoenicia, had been familiar with 
the sea. So it came about that Europe took the initiative in building closer trade rela- 
tions between the East and West. She utilized the overland routes along which the slow 
caravans moved back and forth; her sailors felt out the long passage about the south 
of Africa; they sailed westward across the Atlantic and found America. How different 
might have been the story of the world had the great civilization of China developed a 
seafaring race, and had an adventurous Mongol, making his way eastward from island 
to island, been the first to sight the New World. But China had no Mediterranean in 
which to train sailors, and already the Chinese were content with living unto themselves 
and looking back to their ancestors for guidance. The return of Columbus from his 
first voyage marked for the Orient the passing of a supreme opportunity. 
Yet Columbus was not the first European to bring home news of America. About 
the year 1000 Leif Ericsson of the Vikings made his way westward from Iceland to 
65 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
66 THE PAGEANT OF AMERICA 
Greenland and from Greenland to Vinland, where he camped a space. There is a certain 
fitness in the fact that his little boats sailed the whole way above that old, sunken land- 
bridge which, long ages ago, had made the wild life of the two continents one. But 
America’s time had not yet come. Leif left only the memory of a glorious adventure; 
the famous Genoese was no braver, only more fortunate. So it happened that a few 
Spaniards, captained by an Italian dreamer making his way outward in search of new 
sea routes, stumbled upon a strange continent in the midst of the Atlantic and, by 
so doing, sealed the doom of the red race and snatched from the yellow peoples an 
opportunity that would never return. 
Yet many years passed before the Europeans grasped the full significance of their 
treasure-trove. Much wealth and many lives were squandered in the search for routes 
around or through America to the spices and the silks of Asia. But the search was not 
in vain, for it brought to light the outline of the continents and called into being one of 
the greatest feats of all time, Magellan’s pioneering voyage around the world. Then 
precious metals were found in the American mountains. There was excitement in Spain 
and all manner of men set sail for Cuba, for Mexico, and for the Isthmus of Panama, 
and Peru. No man could tell what the vast hinterland beyond the shore might bring 
forth. The size, the uncertainties, the possibilities for wealth and empire in the new 
country excited the imaginations of the sovereigns of Europe directing the new nations 
arising out of the feudalism of the Middle Ages. It became a day of fantastic visions; 
adventure and romance were in the air. The Atlantic, which had so long been a terrify- 
ing barrier limiting the expansion of Europe, became in one short century a broad high- 
way. Across it stretched a shining silver trail from the American Cordilleras to the 
kingdom of Castile. 
Over this trail from west to east strained Spanish galleons, sails bulging, masts 
bending and holds packed with the precious metal that was making the Spanish king 
master in Europe. Englishmen watched this fleet grow in size and the Spaniard in 
arrogance. Then the Anglo-Saxon turned buccaneer. English sea-dogs began to prowl 
in the Atlantic and to lighten the galleons of their silver ballast. There was a fight in 
1588, less than a hundred years after Columbus had taken possession of an unknown 
coast in the name of the Spanish king, and the Armada limped home amid the jeers 
of the British. The New World was to be English as well as Spanish. 
Trade stirred the imagination of the English, as gold and silver did that of the 
Spaniards. The markets of the world were being opened up and the Briton was every- 
where seeking his profits. Even the American wilderness offered opportunities to drive 
good bargains. Following the behests of trade, England came, somewhat unwittingly, 
into possession of an empire. From Maine to Georgia a chain of frontier settlements 
appeared which gave allegiance to the British king. But hardly were the first enter- 
prises under way when the island kingdom found herself facing in the wilderness her 
ancient enemy France. 
The French had set up the fleur-de-lys on the banks of the St. Lawrence and, with 
a true genius for empire, had plunged into the exploration of the interior. They were, 
in the main, fur-traders, missionaries, and soldiers. The foundations of New France
-P-A-G-E-75
    ADVENTURERS IN THE WILDERNESS 67 
rested on the forest, not on the soil. While the British were digging in almost within 
earshot of the Atlantic, the French swept down the Mississippi valley to the Gulf and 
planted stations on the way. Their plan was nobly conceived and nobly accomplished, 
but it was futile. Old international feuds rose from their graves and were aggravated 
by new rivalries. There were almost a hundred years of intermittent war. Then New 
France fell to England. Meanwhile the Spaniards had advanced steadily northward 
from Mexico into the Arizona desert and on to California; and small nations, like the 
Netherlands and Sweden, had been brusquely pushed aside in their colonial ambitions. 
There is a fascination in looking back from the vantage point of a later century 
to those rude beginnings of civilized life in America. The peoples of Europe had just 
passed through that great intellectual awakening known as the Renaissance, which 
marked the close of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the modern world. New 
thoughts and new ambitions stirred in men’s minds, and the world presented a different 
aspect after the days of Columbus and Magellan. Luther had defied the Pope, and 
the Protestant revolt against the great Roman church was setting Europe by the ears. 
Feudalism was slowly but inevitably giving way to nationalism. Out of such a Europe 
came the first peoples who built their cabins in the American forest. They were French, 
English, Dutch and Spanish, bringing with them the ideas and points of view of their 
homelands. In the main they were humble folk from the vills of the feudal manors 
and the trading centers. They came, following no great Columbian vision, but from 
very simple human motives; to win wealth from gold or the fur-trade; to own a bit 
of land, to find a remote place where they might worship without fear of molestation. 
There were almost no great figures among them. Perhaps a few, like La Salle or Penn, 
could be ranked among the leading minds of their day, but for the most part European 
leaders remained at home fixing their minds on such problems as Europe had not seen 
for a thousand years. The management of the settlements in America was left to lesser 
men. 
Yet in reality these early settlers were a picked group. The ocean, still full of terrors 
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, acted as a great selective force. The timid 
and the physically unfit were kept at home. Only the strongest in mind and body could 
meet the rigorous demands of the wilderness. Death took a heavy toll of those people 
who came to build their homes in the edge of the forest. The little burying grounds, 
so often laid out as soon as the fort, were mute evidence of the risks of the venture. 
Simple folk from quiet village communities where life had run its course with little 
change from generation to generation were plunged into an environment where all was 
strange. They knew neither the forest nor its wild life and, in the main, they were 
unfamiliar with the sea. Yet this first American frontier was set between the two, a line 
of tiny settlements, like beads on a string, following the water’s edge. Dirty, painted 
Indians grunted in the streets of the hamlets. There was always the possibility of war — 
war in which quarter was neither asked nor given. The menace of the savage, the 
danger of disease in the isolated cabin, rough labor, loneliness, — these were the price 
of life in the New World. The pounding of the sea on the desolate coasts served to 
remind the new-comers of the distance that lay between them and home. The fact
-P-A-G-E-76
  68 THE PAGEANT OF AMERICA 
that they persisted in the new life until they succeeded was the measure of the quality 
of the folk who first brought the civilization of Europe to America. Their pioneering 
spirit laid the foundations on which was to be built out of that culture a new 
civilization in a new world. And the personal experience of cutting loose from all that 
was familiar and dear and putting everything to the hazard in a little-known wilderness 
far across the ocean was the first step in the making of the American.

   CHAPTER I 
THE VIKING ADVENTURERS 
Soe is the story of how the destiny of Europe was first linked with that of 
     
   
   
                      America. In northern Scandinavia in the ninth century lived a rugged people, 
individualistic, warlike, ruled over by petty chieftains like the thanes of early 
England. Over them was a king whose power varied with his personal ability. A wild 
hinterland drove these Vikings seaward from their homes at the head of deep-set, high- 
walled fjords. They built better ships than their neighbors. Without a compass they 
abandoned cautious land-hugging and struck out into the open water. The rough 
free life at home and familiarity with the sea in all its moods schooled the Viking in 
courage and initiative; he became a freebooter, a pirate, and also a colonizer. 
A ferment stirred in Norway in the ninth century. The North Sea was dotted with 
the sails of their little open ships. From the chronicles of Christian lands which suffered 
from the scourge of the Northmen has been gleaned most of what is known of these 
aggressive seafarers. They sailed to England and to northern France; they established 
themselves in Baltic Russia. Landsmen were no match for the sailor warriors from the 
north, and for a time the Vikings upset the balance of northern Europe. In vain church 
bells tolled; in vain the litany ascended, “From the fury of the Northmen good Lord 
deliver us.” In their day of greatness they settled Iceland where they founded a com- 
monwealth; from Iceland they crossed to Greenland where they established two fron- 
tier settlements; and from Greenland they sailed to Vinland. 
The location of Vinland must forever remain a mystery. Whatever news Leif 
brought home is recorded in sagas set down long after the event. But the early sagas 
were deliberate attempts at historical narrative and in them is to be found most of what 
is known of the earliest history of Iceland. With some detail they record Leif’s exploit, 
but their geographical descriptions cannot with assurance be attributed to any known 
coast. That part of the continent of North America —the coast of Labrador — was 
explored by the Vikings was demonstrated by the MacMillan Arctic expedition in the 
summer of 1925, when ruins were found on the mainland on the fifty-sixth parallel of 
north latitude. Had the Vikings been merely pirates, they must have sunk into ob- 
livion. There was in them, however, a greatness which left its indelible impress upon 
Europe. But their discovery of America was premature; neither they nor their neigh- 
bors were prepared to develop the continent which lay beyond the ocean.

“Fors are they fierce be- 
yond other foes, and cunning 
as they are fierce; the sea 
is their school of war, and 
the storm their friends; 
they are sea-wolves that 
live on the pillage of the 
world.” So a Roman poet 
sang of the Anglo-Saxons, 
the first great wave of 
Northmen to engulf a Latin 
civilization. His verse is 
equally descriptive of their 
kinsmen, the Vikings of a 
later period.

THE OSEBERG SHIP, VIKING RELIC, 8TH CENTURY 
Tue Norse queen or chieftainess was a Viking too, as well as her husband and her male kin. Here is pictured 
the remains of a queen’s pleasure-boat unearthed at Oseberg, now in the Museum of the University of 
Oslo, Norway. The potter’s clay in which the vessel was buried, preserved it. In it were found the queen’s 
body and that of her maid who had been sent on the final journey with her; and the queen’s household 
possessions, spinning wheels, a loom, balls of thread, and wax, a millstone, sledges, chests, cooking utensils, 
beds and feathers and down from pillows. Around the ship were the skeletons of her horses, dogs, and oxen, 
which had been killed and sent into the unknown with their mistress.

BOW OF THE OSEBERG 
SHIP 
Tue body of the ship is seventy- 
one feet long and sixteen and a 
half feet at its middle breadth. 
It has fifteen oars to a side. The 
original gangplank lies on deck. 
The mast is set amidship into the 
keel and is given extra support 
by a large arched beam. The 
rudder is fastened by an osier 
band and the rudderhead is held 
in the gunwale by plaited rawhide. 
This boat is flatter bottomed than 
the warships, indicating its use 
as a pleasure craft on the fjords. 
Its date is probably about 700 A.D.

Nor even death could part the Viking from the sea. Sometimes his vessel with his body aboard was driven 
off shore in flames as a floating pyre. Sometimes it was buried on the beach, with its skipper in full armor, 
his weapons and drinking cups at hand. Thus through the nether darkness the Viking steered out upon 
invisible waters, master of the sea forever, with Valhalla, the realm of his fierce gods, his destination.

PATHS OF THE NORSE SEA ROVERS, 800-1000 A.D. 
For several hundred years the Scandinavian peoples exhibited a remarkable power of racial expansion. 
The movement was at its height from about the year 800 till nearly the middle of the eleventh century, the 
so-called Viking period. They crossed the Baltic, penetrated the vast wilderness of Russia by way of the 
Dnieper, and threatened Constantinople. They took northern France, which under their rule became 
Normandy. They settled in England, Scotland, and Ireland. The Northman, Canute, ruled from London 
the British Isles, Norway, and Denmark, the first great northern empire and the first British empire in 
history. From Norway and the Hebrides the Vikings colonized Iceland, from Iceland they discovered and 
colonized Greenland, and from Greenland they sailed to America. The conjectural Vinland is somewhere 
on the northeastern coast of the North American continent.

THE FIRST MENTION 
OF VINLAND 
Apam of Bremen was a 
great historian and geog- 
rapher of the eleventh 
century. His Historia is 
a source of information not 
only for Baltic and German 
lands but for the activities 
of the Vikings as far west 
as America. Here is the 
first recorded reference 
(seventh line) to Vinland 
(Winland). Before the 
setting down of the Norse 
sagas, the stories of the 
Vikings had reached even 
Germany.

  A PAGE OF THE SAGAS 
Tux adventure stories of the early Vikings 
are preserved, for the most part, in the 
‘| sagas, the earliest literature of Scandinavia. 
When the art of writing became known, 
the sagas or legends which story-tellers had 
| passed on by word of mouth from genera- 
| tion to generation were gathered into books. 
| Story-telling was introduced into Iceland 
from Norway with the early settlers. In 
| the older country it served for entertain- 
--| ment in kitchen or nursery but in Iceland 
"| it became a chief source of information as 
_4 well as entertainment. The  story-teller 
| assumed a quasi-professional character. The 
Flatey Book, in which the page appears, is 
a collection of sagas with poems and shorter 
tales, composed and compiled between 1387 
and 1395 partly by the priest Jon Pordarson. 
This gives the fullest version of the Vinland 
episode which occurred nearly four hundred 
years before. 
Another, and older, version of the Vin- 
land story appears in the Saga of Eric the 
Red, dating from the thirteenth century. 
Although several authorities have ques- 
tioned the reliability of both versions, 
there is little doubt that there is a con- 
siderable core of fact in both stories. bbit ar dignevda en dr naruevad © omedir: eh = Se hands ne crepe eat

NORSE RUINS, 
GREENLAND 
Eric tHe Rep was an out- 
law from Norway who took 
refuge in Iceland. Hearing 
of a land to the westward, 
said to have been seen by 
some storm-driven mariners, 
he went in search of it and 
afterwards returned with 
tidings of a new country 
which, to attract settlers, 
he named Greenland. In 
986 he sailed for this new 
region with twenty-five 
ships, only fourteen of which made land, and there he planted a colony. Later a second settlement ap- 
peared, and the two endured for over 400 years. The Greenlanders raised many cattle. One settlement 
alone numbered 190 farms. They shipped butter, cheese, and hides to Norway and brought back timber, 
with which they built permanent habitations. Above are the ruins of the cathedral and bishop’s house of 
one of the chief villages.

THE FLEET OF 
LEIF ERICSSON 
Accorp1nG to the Sagas, in the year 
999, Leif Ericsson, son of Eric the 
Red, visited the court of Olaf 
Tryggvesson, King of Norway. The 
young Viking found that the Dusk 
of the Gods had fallen on Scandinavia. 
Odin had given place to Jehovah, 
Baldur to Christ. Olaf, who had 
been converted by an Anglo-Saxon 
monk in the Scilly Islands, had vowed 
to spread Christianity. Leif adopted 
the new faith and resolved to intro- 
duce it into Greenland. The next 
year he turned homeward on_ his 
sacred mission. But destiny had 
first another plan for this Christian 
Viking. Storms took the sails of 
his fleet and sped them far from 
every hitherto known coast.

LEIF ERICSSON — THE LANDING IN VINLAND 
“THERE was dew upon the grass; and having accidentally got some of the dew upon their hands and put 
it to their mouths, they thought that they had never tasted anything so sweet. . . . As soon as their ship 
was afloat they took the boats, rowed to the ship, towed her up the river, and from thence into the lake, 
where they cast anchor, carried their beds out of the ship and set up their tents.” So, in part, runs the 
story of Leif’s discovery as told in the Icelandic sagas. 
The sagas tell of other voyages to Vinland. There was even an attempt to colonize the new land. But 
the only result of these desperate adventurers was to spread abroad among the Viking folk the tradition 
of a fruitful land to the westward, Vinland the good, which Leif the Lucky had found. So the curtain thus 
raised for a moment upon the prologue to the drama of American history was lowered again. The significant 
discovery of America was to fall to the lot of another people.

CHAPTER II 
CONTACTS WITH THE EAST 
r NHE story of Vinland passed into legend and, outside of Scandinavia, was for- 
gotten. Medieval Europeans lived out the cycle of their lives ignorant of 
even its existence. 
The Dark Ages were a time of confusion, of quarrels, forays, and wars. The nobility 
was an aristocracy of arms on land, and armored knights clashed in battle and in sport. 
The system of feudalism maintained what law and order existed. The stone castle of 
the feudal baron was a center of offense and defense for the people who lived about it 
and who did homage to the lord for his protection of them. Walled towns where dwelt 
artisans and men of commerce closed their gates at night against enemies from without. 
Nations, vague shadows of what they were later to become, were forming and dissolving. 
Steadfast above confusion stood the church, a super-state, the greatest stabilizing force 
of the time. Symbols of its power and aspirations were the cathedrals lifting throughout 
Europe their towers toward the heavens. 
Barbarism had been left far behind by medieval Europe. Modern languages were 
taking shape, and a new literature and art were appearing. Education was not yet 
general. A few could read books laboriously copied by hand in the monasteries, but 
the masses of the people looked to the officers of the church for their instruction. The 
mental horizon of the average man was pitifully limited. Yet in this crude and un- 
developed Europe there was the promise of a future greatness. 
Need is the starting-point of progress. Medieval Europe in its daily life needed 
products which its own environment, rich though it was, could not supply: spices to 
season a diet of bread and salted meats; drugs for medicine; silks, precious stones, 
silver, and gold to gratify the demands of luxury as the standard of living rose. Peoples 
living in sub-tropical lands to the eastward produced these goods. Europe slowly became 
aware of it. Trade sprang up. Then began an expansion which carried Europeans not 
only to the civilizations of the East but westward to America, as explorers brought back 
tidings of rich lands across the Atlantic.

CRUSADERS ON THE MARCH, 1096-1270 
Mucu of the first knowledge of the East came to the West through the Crusades. The earliest contacts 
of feudal Europe with the oriental peoples who began in the twelfth century to attend the annual fairs in 
Europe resulted from that supreme romance — the Crusades. Religious fervor, love of adventure, passion 
the Holy Land from the infidel.

Between 1096 and 1270, seven Crusades were undertaken in vain against 
the Saracens. Much of the chivalry and youth of Christendom perished by 
sword and disease while the beloved quest, the tomb of Christ, remained 
in the possession of the Moslem Arabs. But those brave knights who lived 
to return brought back reports of Eastern splendors and samples of Eastern 
arts and crafts. Whither the knights had gone to fulfill a dream, followed 
the merchants to fill their coffers. 
SAINT FRANCIS OF ASSISI, 1181-1226 
Tux second contact with the East came through the religion of love. 
About the year 1206 Francis Bernadone, son of a wealthy Italian merchant, 
forsook the world for a life of poverty. To possess nothing, to serve the 
poor, the outcast, and the leper, were the ideals on which Francis of Assisi 
founded his order of Friars Minor, the Franciscans. He went with the 
Crusaders for the purpose of preaching Christ to the Mohammedans. 
On his death-bed Francis rejoiced to learn of the martyrdom of two of 
his followers in the pagan East. Thus before 1226 had begun that glorious 
tradition of service to the heathen, of heroism, and of charity, which has 
made the Franciscans famous and beloved among the missionaries of the 
Catholic Church. As the missionaries went out bearing the gospel to 
foreign lands, they learned much of strange peoples and civilizations.

CONTACTS WITH THE EAST 
JOANNES DE PIANO CARPINI, 
ca. 1182-1252 
Tue thirteenth century saw descend upon 
Europe a pagan terror as disquieting as 
the Saracens themselves. In 1218 Genghis 
Khan, leader of the Mongol hordes which 
roamed the plateau between China and 
Siberia, had conquered China and Hin- 
dustan. Under his successors the Tartar 
wave swept westward, over Russia, 
Poland, and Hungary, where at last its 
advance was stopped by the combined 
forces of western Europe. In 1245 the 
Pope sent his countryman Carpini, who 
had been one of the companions of [Ri aig 
St. Francis, on a mission to the Great 145 From Pieter Vander Aa, Naaukeurtge 1 
Khan. One of the earliest of European eee 
     
  ameling der nk Waardigste Zee 1707 st-Indien, Leyden, 
explorers of the Mongol empire, he made an overland journey north of the Caspian into the heart of Asia. 
For forty days, he says, his food was “‘nought but millet with salt and water” and his drink “snow melted 
in a kettle.” The mission was unsuccessful, but his book gave Europe the first authentic description of the 
land ruled by the Mongols. 
From Pieter Vander Aa, Zee en Land-Reysen, etc., Leyden, 1707     A FRANCISCAN FRIAR IN CHINA 
In 1258, Louis IX of France sent the Fran- 
cisan friar, William de Rubruquis (1215-70), 
to offer to the Great Khan the Christian 
religion and the advantages of diplomatic 
relations. The friar and his party set out 
from Budak on the Crimean coast and 
crossed the steppes to Mongolia with horses 
and carts, a journey of five thousand miles. 
The Khan, however, did not accept the moral 
benefits offered by Louis. But good Friar 
William, like Carpini, wrote a book which 
contributed to European knowledge of the East and stirred anew the dream of an Orient to be explored, 
won, and redeemed by the Occident. 
BAS-RELIEF EFFIGY OF FRIAR ODORIC, ca. 1286-1331 
In May, 1330, in a Franciscan convent in Padua, there might be seen a group 
of eager friars listening to the marvelous tales told by Brother Odoric, the 
greatest traveler of his time, while his companion, Friar James of Ireland, 
watched to see that no valuable fact or miracle was omitted by Friar William 
of Salagna who was taking down Odoric’s words, and perhaps translating them 
into homely Latin as he went along. Odoric’s travels had taken him from 
Trebizond to the Persian Gulf; and from Ormuz (Milton’s ““Ormus”) to 
Bombay, where four Franciscans had just been killed by the Mohammedan 
governor. Odoric, taking their bones with him, had then passed through 
Malabar, Madras, Ceylon, and had sailed by junk to Sumatra, Borneo, 
Java, and Canton. By land from Canton he had visited Fuchow, Hangchow, 
and Peking. He had turned homeward through Asia, had seen Thibet and 
probably Lhassa itself, and finally had wound down to Venice by way of 
Persia and the Levant.

THE POLOS .LEAVING VENICE 
In the winter of 1271, Marco Polo, aged seventeen — “the young bachelor,” as he calls himself in his book — 
set out from Acre with his father, Nicolo, and his uncle, Maffeo, on their return visit to Cathay. The first 
plan of the Polos was to make China by sea, but they changed their minds and started overland through 
Persia, which was now a Tartar realm ruled by the brother of Kublai Khan of Cathay. In the spring of 
1275, young Marco first saw the Khan at his summer seat, Shang-tu, north of the Great Wall. “The young 
bachelor” so endeared himself to Kublai that the Khan kept him in his service for twenty years, entrusted 
him with diplomatic and military commissions, and made him governor of a city.

Kusuart Kuan was the first of his race to rise above barbarism. 
He was keenly interested in all that the Polos could tell him about 
the outside world. In 1286, he sent a message to the Pope 
asking him to send missionaries. In response, the Franciscan, 
John of Montecorvino, set out in 1289, accompanied by a Domin- 
ican who died on the way. Father John went by way of Persia 
and India, as he was also charged with missions to rulers in those

find that Kublai Khan had just died, but he was hospitably re- Sees 
ceived and by 1299 had established a church. He remained in Peking until his death about 1328, prior 
to which other Franciscans had joined him and he had been raised to the rank of archbishop.

QUAINT ILLUSTRATIONS OF EARLY TRAVELS IN ASIA 
A Frencu artist’s fancy has pictured here the Polos in far Cathay. Chinese castles rise with Norman towers; 
the streets climb and wind as in Fiesole; the river craft of medieval Europe float on an Indian river; the 
trusty little Italian donkeys add an intimate and homely touch. The mind of the medizeval European could 
not conceive civilization so different as that of China. Polo helped to break down this provincialism. 
MAFFEO AND 
NICOLO POLO IN CHINA 
“Tue Great Kuan received them with 
great honor and_ hospitality, and 
showed much pleasure at their visit, 
asking them a great number of ques- 
tions. First, he asked them about the 
Emperors, how they maintained their 
dignity, and administered justice in 
their dominions; and how they went 
to battle, and so forth. And then he 
asked like questions about the Kings 
and princes and other potentates.”

THE ANCIENT CITY 
OF PEKING 
Marco Poto writes that it has two fine 
towers. “One of them has been covered 
with gold a good finger in thickness so 
that the tower looks as if it were all 
solid gold; and the other is covered 
with silver in like manner. The upper 
part is girt all about with bells, the top 
of the gold tower with gilded bells and 
the silver tower with silvered bells.”

  MARCO POLO IN INDIA 
Poo writes of an Indian prince: “He 
wears also a fine silk thread strung with 
104 large pearls and rubies of great 
price. The King wears on his arms 
three golden bracelets thickly set with 
pearls of great value, and anklets also 
of like kind he wears on his legs, and 
rings on his toes likewise. So let me 
tell you what this King wears between 
gold and gems and pearls, is worth 
more than a city’s ransom.”

In Venice still stands a passage and 
a decorated archway of the old Ca’ 
Polo, the mansion of the Polos. At 
the door under that arch, one day 
in 1295, three strangers in fantastic 
and travel-worn garb knocked for 
admittance. The Asiatic travelers 
had returned and, sewed in the 
seams of their garments, was a for- 
tune in precious stones. Soon the 
whole city was agog to hear the tales 
they told, tales which perhaps might 
never have been written down had 
Marco not shipped in a fleet that 
put off to fight the rival Genoese.

otherwise a respectable literary hack, wrote the manuscript. Within less than a year the captivity was over

THE CARAVAN 
Tuousanps of caravans of camels and horses brought the goods of Asia over the long land routes to the 
sea ports where they could be picked up by Europeans. The picture shows the caravan of a Tartar chieftain

VENICE, 1486 
As the contacts with the East grew in numbers, trade increased in volume, Europeans sought more and 
more the spices, the silks and fabrics, the porcelain and the precious stones of Asia. The Mediterranean 
was dotted with a constantly growing fleet of merchantmen. Venice and Genoa became the great dis- 
tributing centers of southern Europe, gathering the riches of Asia from the Black Sea and the eastern Medi- 
terranean, and sending them at a handsome profit to the towns and manors of feudal Europe. Suddenly, 
in 1453, when the invading Ottoman Turks took Constantinople, Asiatics had entered upon conquest in 
Europe.

    CONTACTS 
MOHAMMED ITI 
Mouamnep II, famed for his cruelty, led the 
Turks in their final assault upon Constanti- 
nople, the city founded in 330 by Constantine 
the Great, the first Christian emperor, as the 
capital of the Christian Roman Empire. 
When Constantine XII, Emperor on that 
fateful day, May 29, 1453, saw the Moslem 
banners carried over the walls, he threw 
away his weapons and cast himself upon the 
swords of the foe. But the Turk, in shattering 
an old empire, helped to stir Europe to the 
discovery of a new world. 
CONSTANTINOPLE 
“Aut these products, ‘cloths of silk and gold,’ 
and many more besides, so attractive to the 
unjaded mind of Europe, celebrated in 
chronicle and romance from the thirteenth to 
the fifteenth century, were to be found in 
those cities of the Levant —in Constanti- 
nople, in Antioch or Jaffa or Alexandria — 
which were the western termini of the long 
established trade routes to the Far East. 
Wares of China and Japan and the spices of 
southern Moluccas were carried in Chinese 
or Malay junks to Malacca, and thence by 
Arab or Indian merchants to Paulicut or 
Calicut in southern India. To these ports 
came also ginger, brazil-wood, sandal-wood, and aloe, above all the precious stones of India and 
Persia, diamonds from Golconda.” —Caru Becker, Beginnings of the American People, 1915. WITH THE EAST

TRADE ROUTES 
Tux long trade routes from Asia, by land and sea, led eventually to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. 
Chinese and Japanese junks and Malay boats brought goods to the Moluccas, and Indian and Malay traders 
carried them to Calicut, whence they were taken up the Persian Gulf to Basra and overland, by caravan 
through Bagdad and Damascus, to the Mediterranean. Other goods went by way of the Red Sea to Suez. 
Such were the southern routes. A central route crossed central India, Afghanistan, and Persia to Asia 
Minor. A third came from China and, going north or south of the Caspian, reached the Black Sea. This 
widespread network of commercial routes fell into collapse when the adventurous Portuguese discovered the 
ocean route from Europe around Africa to the Orient.

CHAPTER III 
THE PORTUGUESE NAVIGATORS 
ORTUGAL is a narrow region with navigable rivers flowing westward and a 
P long coast indented by fine harbors. Such a country seems fashioned to breed 
men for the sea. It was from her ports that the Arabs, after the Northmen 
the boldest of medizval mariners, had made their explorations when the Moors held 
sway. The tradition of their voyages and of the new lands which they had discovered — 
the Madeira and Cape Verde Islands — lingered to redound to the glory of her harbors 
in later days. . 
The dawn of the fifteenth century found Portugal once more Christian and inde- 
pendent. By the valor of her arms she had expelled the Moor and had stopped the 
ambitious aggressions of Spain. She was quick with the old spirit of the Crusades. The 
Faith had blessed her sword and had given her power among the nations. The aggrandize- 
ment of that power was therefore to the Portuguese a mission hardly less sacred than 
that of spreading the Faith. 
Hostile Spain, lying east and north of her, blocked her from land communication 
with Europe. Already Portuguese commerce with England, Flanders, and Germany 
had made a virtue of necessity and had been successfully carried on by sea. The accom- 
plishment of both her sacred missions, then, must be by way of the sea.

THE SEA OF DARKNESS 
Aw unknown sea stretched away southward and to the westward from the coasts of Europe touching some- 
where, perhaps, upon the Golden Cathay of Marco Polo’s travels or upon richer lands unseen as yet by 
Christians. Somewhere this ocean received the waters of the “Western Nile” flowing through the realm 
of the mythical Christian King, Prester John, who —so ran the legend — ruled in the heart of Africa, 
beset on all sides by Islam and awaiting his rescue by Catholic Europe. But medieval superstition, a deadlier 
power than. Spanish steel, barred 
the Portuguese empire from that 
sea, which the ancients had justly 
named “The Sea of Darkness.” Out 
beyond its horizon line, luring though 
that might be, this Sea of Darkness 
was held to be the home of weird 
monsters that dragged down ships, 
a place of thick and noisome vapors 
that strangled men and forever blew 
their thin ghosts about, lost wan- 
derers in a chill and supernatural 
fog.

THE PORTUGUESE NAVIGATORS 89 
HENRY THE NAVIGATOR 
1394-1460 
A Saint Grorce to slay this sea-dragon 
of superstition was the need of the hour. 
He came in the person of Henry, later 
surnamed the Navigator, fourth son of 
John I of Portugal. Henry was one of 
the first scholars in Europe, a warrior 
of renown, and a man of devout Christian 
life. He had, moreover, enough Norse 
blood in him from his grandfather, “Old 
John of Gaunt, time-honor’d Lancaster,” 
not to fear the sea. Moreover, he had 
Marco Polo’s book and a rare collection 
of maps, the one to inspire and the 
other to assist him in piercing the 
mystery of the Sea of Darkness that 
men so feared. Prince Henry did not 
dissipate his energies in many enter- 
prises. With iron determination, each 
year he advanced farther and farther to- 
ward his one great objective. 
THE “SACRED PROMONTORY,” 
WHERE PRINCE HENRY 
STUDIED 
In 1419 Henry went to Sagres, a rocky 
promontory at the southernmost tip of 
Portugal. Here he erected an observa- 
tory and drew about him scientists and 
seasoned mariners. There were many 
questions to be answered. Was this 
world really flat, with its doming sky 167 From a miniature in Gomes de Azurara, Une Chronique de la Découverte Me So Ae bet anal WT ane AT nS et de la Conquéte de Guinea, 1448-53, in the Bibliotheque Nationale, Parls 
off-shore waves end? What of ebb and flow? By study of the heavens, man would master the tides, said 
the Arabs whose chief science was astronomy. To Henry, the Christian, seeking nightly for that answer 
in the sky, seeking through 
the patient years while the 
names of fool and blasphemer 
were hurled at him, this saying 
had a twofold meaning. For 
was it not decreed in the be- 
ginning by the God who 
charted the heavens and gave 
the Gospel for a light to the 
mind that man should have 
dominion over the sea and 
its terrors? To Henry the 
Navigator the answer seemed 
within his grasp. During his 
lifetime the Navigator saw the 
results of his work change pro-

HENRY AT THE SAGRES 
OBSERVATORY 
Year after year Henry sent out ships 
that worked their way farther and 
farther down the hot and inhospitable 
African coast. They passed the land 
of the tawny Moors and came upon the 
white sands of the Sahara. Further they 
sailed and left behind even the bounds 
of Islam. Then in 1445 Diniz Diaz 
pushed beyond the desert to the green 
country of the Soudan. He found and 
named Cape Verde. Beyond this prom- 
ontory where the coast begins to fall 
away, Henry’s navigators turned their 
prows eastward, and excitement ran 
high, for surely now, they thought, they 
were rounding Africa. Black natives 
on the shores peered in wonder at the 
strange ships. And to Africa, as to 
America, woe and injustice came by 
sea, for some of these dark men were 
brought back to Portugal, and ere long 
a profitable slave trade sprang up. 
Henry had nerved his captains to 
conquer the superstition of the Sea of 
Darkness; but mariners who feared not 
the monsters of the deep must be per- 
suaded to forgo the profits of the new 
trade.

FRAGMENTS OF A PADRAO 
SET UP BY BARTHOLOMEW DIAZ 
Henry’s seamen followed the African coast for two thousand 
miles, here and there planting stone columns as milestones 
to mark their progress on the sea lane to India. From the long 
voyage they brought back ivory, gold, and slaves, three fateful 
gifts of Africa to the white explorer. Explorations that proved 
so profitable did not cease with Henry’s death. In 1482 Diego 
Cam discovered the Congo. Six years later Bartholomew Diaz 
rounded the Cape. Because of the cruel winds he had 
encountered he called it “The Cape of Storms.” But when 
King John II heard the joyful news that the long wall of con- 
tinent had at last been passed and eastern waters entered, he 
renamed it “The Cape of Good Hope.” The illustration 
shows fragments of a stone set up by Bartholomew Diaz in 
1487 on the coast of Africa.       170 From the original in the Sociedade de Geografia de Lisboa, Lisbon

PORTUGUESE VOYAGES DOWN THE AFRICAN COAST 
Prince Henry firmly believed that, if the African coast were followed south, a cape would be dis- 
covered which the mariner could round and then start for India. So great was his influence that his 
belief was imparted to his followers. It was accepted by Fra Mauro, working at Venice, in the years 
1457-1459, on a map of the world. An examination of the northern part of the map makes clear its 
surprising accuracy. The north shore of 
“Sinus Ethyopicus” is that along which the 
Portuguese captains turned eastward after pass- 
ing Cape Verde. Across the map Egypt and 
the Red Sea, “Mare Rubrum,” are shown in 
their proper relations. The southern part of 
Africa is pure conjecture, in the midst of which 
is put the land of the mythical Prester John, 
the isolated Christian engulfed in a Mohamme- 
dan flood. Because it was carefully done and 
based on the best information obtainable, this 
map had wide influence on the navigators of 
the day. It beckoned them to further voy- 
ages down the African coast and around the 
southern point to India and Persia.   
KING JOHN IN THE SHIPYARD 
Henry went to his tomb no longer the scorned 
but the honored of his nation. Because Henry’s 
faith held stanch through twelve years of 
mockery and failure, when even his captains 
betrayed him and sometimes, fear-driven, fled 
back to Sagres, King John II stood in a later 
day in the shipyard directing the building of 
the Indian fleet. Neither demons nor darkness 
should assail those galleons. And, at the end 
of the voyage, waited the opulent markets of 
the East.

VASCO DA GAMA, ca. 1460-1524 
Joun died before the fleet for India 
sailed. His successor sent out Vasco 
da Gama, who after many days upon an 
uncharted sea dropped anchor in the 
harbor of Calicut, west coast of India, 
on May 20, 1498. When Vasco turned 
homeward the prows of his ships he left 
a marble column on the shore to announce 
that Portugal had added a second conti- 
nent to her empire. In 1499, seven years 
after Columbus’ famous voyage, the Por- 
tuguese government smilingly informed 
the Spanish court that a “nobleman of 
our household” had found the route to 
the real Indies, and the “large cities, and 
great populations” which Columbus had 
failed to discover; in proof of which he 
had brought home “cinnamon, cloves, 
ginger, nutmeg, pepper, also many fine 
stones of all sorts; so that henceforth all 
Christendom in this part of Europe shall 
be able, in large measure, to provide 
itself with these spices and precious 
stones.” 
Da Gama’s discovery of an all-water 
route to the Orient revolutionized com- 
merce. It was far cheaper to ship the 
freight of the East around the Cape of 
Good Hope than to carry it with several 
rehandlings overland by caravan. The new route was more important than the coming of the Turks 
in diverting trade from the Mediterranean to Portuguese ports on the Atlantic. 
CABRAL’S SHIPS OFF 
THE COAST OF BRAZIL 
In 1500 Pedro Alvarez Cabral, 
another intrepid adventurer 
of the day, set out from Portu- 
gal for India. Cabral, how- 
ever, stood far out from the 
coast on this voyage and 
was blown westward to the 
shore of Brazil, where he 
planted the standard of Portu- 
gal. Brazil, it is true, had 
already been discovered in 
1499 by Vicente Yafies 
Pinzén, who commanded the 
little Niza on Columbus’ first 
voyage. But, by the Pope’s 
arbitrary line of division and 
the subsequent treaty be- 
tween Spain and Portugal, 
Brazil lay in Portugal’s half     174 From the portrait by Christovao de Utrecht (born 1498), In the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, Lisbon

  CHAPTER IV 
CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS 
‘ N Y HILE Portuguese captains were venturing down the African coast in search 
of a water route to the East two monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, were 
welding Spain into a nation. The union of the separate kingdoms of Aragon 
and Castile was but one of the problems that confronted the Spanish rulers. Seven cen- 
turies before, hordes of African Mohammedans had crossed the Straits of Gibraltar and 
conquered their way into Europe. The Moors, as they were called, had been thrown 
back in long and bloody wars. In 1481, the armies of Ferdinand and Isabella moved 
against Granada, the last stronghold of the infidels. The task was difficult. Not until 
eleven years had passed were the Spanish arms successful. At last, on January 2, 1492, 
Granada surrendered and the Moor passed finally out of Europe. 
One of those who watched the surrender ceremony was an Italian navigator, Chris- 
topher Columbus. Nearly five years before he had first presented to the Spanish court a 
plan for sailing westward across the unknown ocean to Asia. But the Moorish wars had 
absorbed the attention and depleted the treasury of the sovereigns and little heed had 
been given to Columbus. Yet he had persisted in his quest. He was familiar with the 
best thought of the time that the earth was round, and shared in that belief. He was 
profoundly convinced that great discoveries would follow a voyage westward. 
Columbus had been born in Genoa, the son of a weaver. Doubtless, as a boy, along 
the wharves of the busy Italian port, he had heard from returned sailors strange tales of 
distant lands. The sea attracted him and when he was but fourteen he was sailing before 
the mast. Most of the details of the early life of the great navigator are lost in the mists of 
the past. The origin of the idea that was to dominate his career will probably never be 
known. When he was twenty-five he made a voyage to England. In February of the 
following year, according to his own account, he ventured “‘a hundred leagues beyond the 
island of Thule [Iceland].” Perhaps he came into contact with the old Norse tradition 
of Vinland. In the ports of Portugal and Spain tales of mysterious islands beyond the 
Canaries were bandied about. The maps of the day gave them form. Perhaps this 
gossip of the seaboard awakened in the mind of the imaginative Genoese the vision of 
lands that lay to the west. He had read the travels of Marco Polo; perchance he also 
might reach Cathay. 
The world into which Columbus had been born was full of new thoughts. In the 
cities of his own Italy had come the Renaissance that was bringing new life to Europe. 
Men were turning from the cramped philosophy of the Middle Ages to the rich thought 
of ancient Greece. Freedom and individualism were in the air. Men were exploring 
the realms of the spirit as well as of the earth. The dreams of Columbus were in harmony 
with the growth of the age. Others believed in a round world and in lands to the west- 
ward, but in the great admiral persistence and fortitude were united with imagination. 
When he returned from the first voyage, he had broadened immeasurably the horizon of 
Europe. The Middle Ages had come to an end.

MARTIN BEHAIM’S GLOBE 
Cotumsus had an intellectual double, Martin Behaim of Nurem- 
berg, a cosmographer. Both believed in a round world. Behaim, 
to prove his theories, had made a secret voyage westward in part- 
nership with his patron, Estreito of Madeira, but the expedition 
failed. Returning to Nuremberg, he set forth his ideas in the 
famous globe which he completed in 1492 before the return of 
Columbus. It shows the influence of Ptolemy and of the dis- 
coveries of Marco Polo. The Atlantic is filled with the islands 
familiar to the myths of the Middle Ages. There is no evidence 
that Columbus was influenced by Behaim in his great undertaking. 
The two men were in Portugal at the same time but no connection 
between them has been established. 
The significance of the Behaim globe lies in its vivid presenta- 
tion of the ideas that were current at the time when the Genoese 
opened a new chapter in geographical knowledge.

  96 THE PAGEANT OF AMERICA 
THE PORTRAITS OF 
COLUMBUS 
So far as is known there is no portrait 
of Columbus in existence that was painted 
during his lifetime. Yet many artists 
have portrayed what they conceived to 
be the features of the great admiral. 
The purpose of the following collection 
of portraits is to show some of the more 
significant of these attempts. 
The Jovius portrait is an engraving 
which is believed to have been first 
published in 1575. It is a copy of a 
portrait that hung in the famous gallery 
of Paulus Jovius, Archbishop of Nocera 
(1483-1552). Jovius, a man of vast 
wealth who spent a fortune in collecting 
portraits of the great men of his time, 
was an ardent admirer of Columbus, 
though but a young man when Columbus 
died. On Jovius’ walls hung a portrait of 
Columbus which has since been lost. It 
is inconceivable that Jovius would have 
been content with less than the most 
faithful possible portrait of his favorite 
hero. Perhaps the Archbishop’s picture 
was one which had been painted in 
Columbus’ lifetime. If so, this vigorous 
engraving of a man in middle life must 
approximate the features of the dis- 
coverer of America. No portrait with     179 From Paulus Jovius, Elogia Virorum Illustrium, Basil, 1595 
better claims has yet appeared, and it is interesting to be able to trace the influence of the first attempt 
to portray the Discoverer, as is seen in the Jovius portrait, on all of the subsequent paintings of Columbus.

THE YANEZ PORTRAIT (182) 
A STRANGE story clings to the 
Yafiez portrait. In 1763 the 
Spanish government bought from 
Sefior Yafiez of Granada four por- 
traits, including one of Columbus, 
all painted by the same hand. 
Many years later the Columbus 
portrait was found to have been 
altered before its purchase. With 
great skill the daubs that con- 
cealed the original were cleared 
away and the portrait as here 
reproduced was brought to light. 
It bears unmistakable marks of ae 
the Italian school of the sixteenth 183 From the portrait, 1838, by Charles Legrand, 
century. Strong claims have 
been made that this is the Jovius portrait, the engraving 
of which it strongly resembles. This Yaiiez portrait is 
perhaps the only one in which are presented complete 
the characteristics of Columbus which those who knew 
him personally have described. Yet too little is known 
of it to establish its authenticity.      182 From the portrait in the Biblioteca Nacional, Madrid 
THE MADRID PORTRAIT (183) 
TuE Madrid portrait was painted in 1838 at the order 
of the Spanish government. The artist seems to have 
used the old Capriolo engraving for his model. 
THE DE ORCHI PORTRAIT (184) 
Tue painter of the de Orchi portrait is unknown. Its 
likeness to the Florence portrait has led to the belief 
that the two had a common original. Claims have been 
made that this is the lost Jovius portrait. 
THE CAPRIOLO PORTRAIT (185) 
Tue Capriolo portrait is evidently derived from the 
Jovius. The Madrid portrait shows striking resem-

       PIERRE D’AILLY’S IMAGO MUNDI 
Tue geographer d’Ailly set forth, in his Imago Mundi, 
ideas of a round earth. Because the book was printed 
in 1480, many have thought that Columbus derived his 
ideas from it. A copy annotated in the handwriting of 
Christopher, or in that of his brother Bartholomew, is 
among the Columbian relics at Seville, but there seems 
to be no evidence that Columbus read or used it before 
his epoch-making voyage of 1492. 
FERDINAND, 1452-1516, KING OF ARAGON 
Barty in 1486 Columbus interviewed the Spanish sover- 
eigns at Cordova. The time was not propitious. It is true 
that Ferdinand, by his marriage with Isabella, had 
united the crowns 
of Aragon and 
Castile and had 
thus strength- 
ened his kingdom 
against the hea- 
then, but the 
Moors still held 
the southwest. All 
Ferdinand’s re- 
sources were at 
this time conse- 
crated to the task 
of European con- 
questand could not 
be diverted to out- 
fitting Columbus 
for the purpose of 
attempting trans- 
atlantic discovery.

THE PRESENTATION AT. COURT 
In his later years Columbus complained 
that in his struggle for recognition in 
Spain “everybody had derided him, 
save two Monks, Marchena and Pérez.” 
Laughed at he was, but probably not 
so much because of his theories of the 
earth, which many others held, but be- 
cause of the stupendous rewards which 
his great ambition led him to demand 
in case he should be successful. To 
be governor of the lands he discovered, 
to have one tenth of all the trade ex- 
changes within those lands, to be admiral 
of the “Ocean Sea” that washed the 
shores of distant Cathay, and to be made 
a nobleman — such aspirations for the _ 
son of a Genoese weaver seemed ridicu- From the painting signed “‘ M. Crespo, Madrid, 1889,” artist and location not known, Photograph by Roig 
  lous. They had already hurt his cause 
with King John of Portugal, to whom Columbus had first made his proposition for a voyage westward 
into the Atlantic ocean. When Columbus had failed in Portugal, he turned to Spain. 
THE COUNCIL OF SALAMANCA, 1486-87 
Tue court referred the project of Columbus to Hernando de Talavera, who thereupon called a council of 
ecclesiastics, scientists, and mariners to consider it. After nearly five years the council reported adversely. 
Meanwhile, Christopher’s brother, Bartholomew, had appealed in vain to Henry VII of England and was 
now importuning Charles VIII of France. To France Christopher resolved to go; but first he determined 
to visit the convent of la Rabida near Palos in Andalusia. Here he had a friend, Antonio de Marchena, 
the former guardian, and in his care Columbus planned to leave his little son, Diego.

THE CONVENT OF 
LA RABIDA 
At Santa Maria de la Rabida, 
Columbus arrived in poverty 
and in dejection of spirits. But 
St. Mary of the Frontier was 
to be for him that boundary of 
failure from which the last 
successful march upon achieve- 
ment is made. Marchena and 
the officiating guardian, Juan 
Pérez, heard his story with en- 
thusiasm. Who could be more 
eager to discover new lands 
than Franciscans? Already their 
Order had a glorious roll of ex- THE PAGEANT OF AMERICA

COLUMBUS AND THE FRIARS OF LA RABIDA 
Cotumpus, Marchena, and Pérez devised a plan whereby the Italian navigator, using Palos as a center, 
should gather together in the maritime section of Spain all possible information regarding voyages into the 
Sea of Darkness. At Santa Maria a pilot told him that he had recently sailed due west from Ireland and 
had sighted land, probably Labrador. Another pilot in Palos itself, at the very doors of La Rabida, re- 
counted a voyage west with “a Prince of Portugal” to discover new lands and his encounter with the leagues 
of weed floating in the Sargasso Sea, which compelled a return. Columbus also learned something of the 
exploration plans of the most important man in maritime affairs at Palos, Martin Alonso Pinzén, then 
absent in Rome marketing a cargo of sardines and incidentally scanning documents in the Papal library.

OF CASTILE, 1451-1504 
WuarteEver news Pinzén brought home 
presently was enough to send Pérez off 
at dead of night, riding on a mule, to see 
Isabella. Pérez had been the Queen’s 
confessor. He knew her to be an ardent 
Catholic, an ambitious queen, a power 
with Ferdinand, and rich enough to 
finance the venture for which Pinzén 
and Columbus had now joined forces. 
Her imagination fired by Pérez’s tale, 
Isabella summoned Columbus and called 
a council to arrange ways and means. 
With success almost in his grasp the 
navigator came to the court, not as a 
poor suitor, but still persistent in his 
demands for high offices and great emol- 
uments as the price for his services.

would make-him, if he succeeded, almost second to the crown in power.

THE SANTA MARIA, FLAGSHIP OF COLUMBUS 
Co.umBvs, in supreme command, is on the Santa Maria, which is sailed by her owner, Juan de la Cosa, a 
cosmographer of Palos. She carries two pilots, a grand constable, a physician, an archivist and — as a wise 
forethought! — an interpreter. Martin Alonso Pinzén captains his own Pinta, and his brother, Francisco, 
pilots her. His youngest brother, Vicente Yaiies, commands the little Nifia, and her owner, Pero Alonso 
Nino, goes as pilot. Some ninety seamen man the fleet, caught by Pinz6n’s ery along the wharves of Palos: 
“*Friends, come with us! . . . You will find the houses with roofs of gold, and you will return rich and 
prosperous!”” To the Canaries first they sailed, then west, west, on the trail of the sinking sun. 
THE ASTROLABE AIDS COLUMBUS 
Our into the Sea of Darkness sailed three small ships, 
sturdy and seaworthy, but with only crude equipment 
for crossing the great, mysterious Atlantic. For their 
direction the pilots had the compass. The astrolabe, an 
ancient device for taking the altitude of sun, moon, 
and stars, and recently perfected for use at sea, aided 
in determining the ship’s position. The prevailing winds 
and currents were unknown, and the distance to land 
ahead was a baffling mystery. Yet these pioneers 
were willing to risk the venture with such instruments 
and the knowledge they had. 
The astrolabe was the forerunner of the modern sex- 
tant. It consisted of a circular disk marked with the 
degrees of arc on the circumference and was sus- 
pended from a ring, so as to hang vertically. The 
observation was made through two uprights at the ends 
of a bar, pivoted at the center. The axis of these 
uprights was pierced with small holes for sighting 
through, and the elevation of the object was read on

THE LANDFALL OF COLUMBUS 
“Tue weather was like April in Andalusia,” the smooth sea “like the river at Seville,” and “nothing was 
wanting but to hear the nightingales.”” Thus the admiral later wrote. But day after day passed with the 
same monotonous winds driving the ships westward. His crews became frightened. Weeks passed without 
the promised land. Mutiny was secretly plotted among the men. But Columbus remained master of the 
situation. On October 7, Pinzén persuaded Columbus to alter the course from west to west-southwest. 
In the dawn of the twelfth, land was sighted — the faint shadow of a new world. The story goes that 
Columbus, on deck and watching intently for any sign of land, thought he saw a light moving in the distance. 
He pointed it out to a companion. The moon was up, and, about two o’clock, a sailor, watching from the 
Pinta, in the white light clearly discerned the dark line of a sandy shore. The cry of land was shouted from 
ship to ship. The greatest landfall in history had taken place. The fears of the crew which had almost led 
to open revolt were now banished, and with joyous anticipation they awaited the dawn. Columbus later 
claimed the reward offered to the first man who sighted land. The gray line on the horizon was the vindica- 
tion of Columbus’ dream and the reward of his persevering courage. It meant glory, wealth and power; 
he would now be “admiral of the Ocean-Sea.”” This voyage of Columbus has rightfully taken its place as one 
of the great adventures of history. Its conception and execution displayed a scientific spirit that was quite 
at variance with the habits of the medieval mind. Columbus amassed all the data obtainable with regard to 
the shape of the earth and the existence of land to the westward. From these facts he inferred that a 
voyage into the unknown ocean would eventually bring him to a shore at its western edge. His moral 
qualities are shown in his willingness to risk his life to prove that his conclusions were correct. Few geo- 
graphical discoveries have brought about so widespread and so sudden a mental readjustment as did that 
of Columbus. The attention of Europe and, to a certain extent, of posterity has been centered upon 
his discovery of land. It should be remembered, however, that he began with outlining and determining 
the characteristics of an ocean. In a very real sense Columbus was the discoverer of the Atlantic as 
well as America. 202 From the painting, about 1840, by Christian Ruben

THE LANDING OF COLUMBUS 
Wrapprep in the scarlet cloak of a Castilian Admiral, Columbus stepped ashore, dropped to his knees, and 
kissed the sand. Then rising, he drew his sword, unfurled the royal standard, and named this new Spanish 
possession San Salvador. The scene was strange and impressive. An Italian navigator with the ceremony 
and pomp of Spain claimed a wild beach washed by an unknown ocean for the King and Queen who had 
made his voyage possible. But hidden from those who shared the emotions of that happy landing was 
the fact that they were beginning a new page in the history of men. They did not know and could not 
dream even a little of the 
significance of what they 
hadaccomplished. No more 
could the frightened na- 
tives, who after a time fear- 
fully approached them, un- 
derstand that on that day 
destiny sealed the red man’s 
doom. The Indian name of 
the island was Guanahani, 
now generally identified 
with Watling.

COLUMBUS’ CHART 
In 1924 there was brought to light in the Bibliothéque Nationale in Paris an old map drawn on calfskin and 
still showing the vivid red, blue and green of the colors when first applied. M. Charles de la Ronciére, the 
distinguished Director of Documents in the Library, has dated the map between 1488 and 1493. He 
believes that the evidence in the map proves it to be the chart that Columbus showed the Spanish sovereigns 
and that the real aim of the expedition was not India, but the legendary island of the Seven Cities.

MAP OF COLUMBUS’ VOYAGES 
Tue numerals on the line of the voyage which Columbus made in 1492 are the dates of important incidents. 
On the 11th of September, the explorer saw a large piece of a mast; on the 14th, a tern and boatswain 
bird; on the 16th, much weed; on the 22nd, sandpipers; on the 29th, man-of-war birds; on the 3rd of 
October, more weed; on the Sth, flying-fish; on the 7th, men on the Nifia thought they sighted land; on 
the 8th and 9th, ducks were seen; on the 11th, a green rush and a pole and at night a light ahead. Other 
dates relate to rains, to climatic conditions, or to variations of the compass. 
The story of the remaining voyages is one of mingled triumph and humiliation. In the second voyage, 
which lasted from 1493 to 1496 he discovered Porto Rico and Jamaica and visited Cuba, compelling his 
entire ship’s company to swear that they believed it to be the mainland. The third voyage, 1498 to 
1500, brought Columbus to the mainland of South America, his greatest achievement next to his 
original discovery. 
The purpose of the fourth voyage was to find a strait through the lands he had discovered to the 
Portuguese sea. He accomplished nothing more than to skirt the coast of Central America. When he 
returned, in 1504, his patroness, Isabella, was dying.

this, by which you shall know 
that in thirty-three days I passed 
over to the Indies with the fleet 
which the most illustrious King 
and Queen, our Lords gave me; 
where I found many Islands

number. And of them all I have

So begins the letter, written by 
Columbus to Luis de Santangel 
on his return voyage in 1493. It 
is believed to be a copy of the first 
edition of the letter printed in 
Barcelona in April, 1493. It was 
discovered in Spain in 1889. It 
consists of two leaves of very

THE DEATH OF 
COLUMBUS 
CotumBus discovered an ocean 
as well as a new world. Yet his 
day of favor was brief. He did 
not bring back from his voyages 
the riches of the East. Da Gama 
did this for the rival Portuguese 
in 1498. On May 20, 1506, in 
a humble dwelling in Valladolid, 
deserted and practically for- 
gotten by all but his sons and a 
few friars, the great discoverer 
breathed his last, not realizing 
the true significance of his great 
achievement.

CHAPTER V 
SEARCH FOR THE WESTERN ROUTE 
India, and Columbus discovered the South American continent blocking his path 
to that part of Asia where riches lay. Asia had been reached by the African route 
and its wealth had been sampled; but the African route was ten thousand miles long, 
and it was dangerous. Columbus believed that south of the limit of his explorations 
there was a passage beyond the American mainland. But the great dream of reaching 
the East by way of the West now stirred the hearts of venturesome seamen in other 
lands than Spain. It had, indeed, been the talk of seamen ever since Diaz had come home 
to tell of the eastern ocean beyond the “Cape of Storms.” There were those who thought 
that a river flowed from China through this new continent of America; others believed 
that there was no continent but rather a group of very large islands, and that among 
these islands lay the passage which presently came to be spoken of as the Strait of Anian. 
Where lay this strait — whether to the north or the south or, perhaps again, just to the 
west of the land found by Columbus — no one knew. Its importance, however, none 
failed to grasp. The nation which should discover that strait and fortify it would be 
master of the world. Therein lay the motive of the struggle which followed, a struggle 
in which all gained —; England, Portugal, Spain, Holland, and France. Around this 
contest centers much of the early history of America. From it emerged two mighty 
continents, no longer mere barriers to the riches of the East, but a vast and far-flung 
arena where the colonial schemes of rival European powers were to clash for the next 
two hundred years. I N one and the same year, 1498, Vasco da Gama circumnavigated Africa and reached

112 THE PAGEANT OF AMERICA 
JOHN CABOT AND HIS SON 
SEBASTIAN 
Joun Cazort (1450-98) was an Italian who had 
given his allegiance first to Venice, then to 
England. He was a captain in the employ of the 
Merchant-Venturers of Bristol in 1496, the year 
when Henry VII gave him “full and free authoritie, 
leave, and power, to sayle to all partes, Countreys, 
and Seas, of the East, of the West, and of the 
North,” and also “licence to set up Our banners 
and ensignes in every village, towne, castel, yle, 
or maine lande, of them newly founde.’”’ Whether 
Cabot was prompted by the discoveries of 
Columbus or had, even so early as 1490, dreamed 
of finding his way to the, perhaps, not distant 
Cathay, is uncertain. 
In the springtime of 1497, Cabot sailed from 
Bristol and in the little Matthew, with a crew of 
eighteen, he braved the storms of the North 
Atlantic. On the 24th of June, he reached the 
shores of North America somewhere between the 
modern Halifax and Hudson Strait, and planted 
St. George’s Cross for England on what he be- 
lieved to be the territory of the Great Khan. 
Thus the British flag first came to continental 
America.

JOHN CABOT

In the port of Bristol

nificance of the first 
transfer of British 
power across the At- 
lantic. Cabot sailed 
as a master mariner 
on the roster of the 
Merchant-Venturers of 
Bristol. Most im- 
portant in his instruc- 
tions was the charge 
to find the route to 
Asia; but he found a 
continent instead.

SEBASTIAN CABOT 
14762-1557? 
Joun Cazor sailed a second time for 
America and never returned. One of 
the most important results of his first 
voyage was the opening up of a route 
from northern Europe to the rich fisheries 
of Newfoundland. Not many years after 
Cabot’s famous trip the summer months 
saw the Grand Banks dotted with Portu- 
guese, French, Spanish, and English 
fishing boats. Some historians doubt the 
old statement that Sebastian accompanied 
his father. In after years the son became 
a figure of consequence, so more may have 
been attributed to him than was his due. 
JUAN DE LA COSA’S 
MAP, 1500 
Parntepin brilliant colors and hanging now 
in the Museo Naval at Madrid is the La 
Cosa map made in 1500, the oldest map 
known to have been drawn subsequent to 
the discovery of America. The Spanish, 
English, and Portuguese flags record the 
discoveries of those nations. In this map, 
as in so many that follow it, the coast 
line of northern North America is carried

pole lies south of the true pole and therefore deflects the compass westward.

THE CABOT MAP — SECTIONAL VIEW 
Tue Cabot map, found in 1855 in Germany, is a large engraved map of the world, in several sheets. Who 
made it is not known, but that it was done by the hand of Sebastian Cabot is not believed by all scholars. 
It is full of errors, and its chief interest lies in the fact that it bears out the theory of the discovery of the 
North American continent by John Cabot. Printed in Latin at the side appears the statement, referring 
to Newfoundland, that “This land was discovered by John Cabot, a Venetian, and Sebastian Cabot his 
son, in the year of the birth of our Saviour Jesus Christ, 
— < M. CCCC. XCIIII (1494), the twenty-fourth day of

the said land, the name of St. John has been given, 
on account of its having been discovered the same day.” 
AMERIGO VESPUCCI, 1451-1512 
A ctoup of mystery envelops the figure of Vespucci, 
whose Christian name in its Latin form was given to 
the New World. A few facts stand forth; he was a 
Florentine who drifted to Spain; he visited Espafiola 
and the mainland in a search for pearls with the 
Spaniard, Ojeda, in 1499; and he wrote a letter in 
which he called the western lands “Mundus Novus” 
rather than Asia. Perhaps he was not always truthful. 
Whatever his shortcomings, however, it was not he who 
suggested the honor which his name received. The 
latest critical study of Vespucci develops the thesis that 
he, before Columbus, discovered the mainland and that 
he was the first to realize that Mundus Novus (South 
America) was wholly distinct from Asia and was, in fact,

ulty, Mathias Ringman, a Latinist, and Martin Waldseemiiller, a geographer, were preparing a new edition 
of Ptolemy’s Geographia. Before its publication, however, they printed a little essay called Cosmographiae 
Introductio, to which they added the letter of Vespucci. It was in this essay that Waldseemiiller offered the 
suggestion which was destined to make the name of Amerigo Vespucci famous forever. 219 From Waldseemiiller, Cosmographtae Introductio, St. Dié, May, 1507. In the New York Public Library 
THE PORTUGUESE IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC 
As early as 1500, Caspar Cortereal, a Portuguese nobleman of the Azores, embarked on the great search for 
a route to Asia. Believing that the coveted passage lay to the north, he sighted the American coast at 
Newfoundland and explored as far north as Hudson Strait. Next year he was back again with three ships. 
Probably they made land at Cabot’s Cape Breton; and there Cortereal saw Venetian rings in an Indian’s 
ears, which led him to believe that he had arrived in Asia in the wake of some European trading vessel. 
Leaving two of his ships, he went exploring northward and was heard of no more. The next year his brother 
Miguel came in search of him; but Miguel and his ship, too, were never seen again.

THE ISTHMUS OF PANAMA (JUNGLE OF DARIEN) 
Vasco NuNrz Bapoa was a bankrupt and from Espajiola he smuggled himself out to sea in a cask or the 
bunt of a sail. He was put off on the mainland at a little Spanish colony. In a short time Balboa made 
himself the leader of the wretched colony, beset by hunger and Indians. He adopted a shrewd policy of 
friendship with the Indians, who were peculiarly dangerous enemies on account of their poisoned arrows. 
From the Indians he heard of a great sea to the west, and set out on the adventure of discovering it, partly 
to retrieve himself for usurping command in the colony 
and partly in the hope of finding riches. 
BALBOA DISCOVERS THE PACIFIC, 1513 
. . . When with eagle eyes 
He stared at the Pacific — and all his men 
Looked at each other with a wild surmise — 
Silent, upon a peak in Darien. 
From the peak in Darien, where on his knees he had rendered 
thanks for the new ocean seen afar, Balboa sent Pizarro to 
find the shore. On September 29, 1513, with drawn sword 
and lifted banner, Balboa marched alone into the mighty 
waters of the Pacific and claimed them for his King. Thus 
Balboa discovered that the New World, in one place at 
least, was but a slender isthmus and that an ocean washed 
its western side. Through such a narrow country as this 
there must be a strait, he thought, linking the two seas 
and offering the route to Asia.

FERDINAND MAGELLAN 
ca. 1480-1521 
Wuen Balboa discovered another ocean 
but forty-five miles west of the Atlantic, 
he gave a tremendous impetus to westward 
exploration. The general impression now 
was that America was a huge peninsula, 
like a larger India, and doubtless was joined 
by Asia on the north. At its southern 
extremity the two oceans must meet. In 
this belief a Portuguese, Ferdinand Ma- 
gellan, a nobleman and fighting mariner 
who had already voyaged to India and 
Malay, set out in 1519, with a Spanish 
fleet of five old and rotten boats manned 
by motley crews, to reach India by the 
western route. November found him at 
Brazil. January he spent exploring Rio 
de la Plata, hoping that it was the strait 
he was in search of. Disappointed, he con- 
tinued southward. One of his ships was lost. 
From April to August 24, he was in

the big feet of the natives. Herewith great §

  HOW MAGELLAN FOUND THE WAY TO THE PACIFIC 
Tue new strait found by Magellan, 360 miles long and as crooked as a serpent, is one of the most dangerous 
stretches of navigable water on the globe. For many days Magellan, with his three shiploads of fear- 
stricken men smouldering with rebellion, sailed onward through a labyrinth of precipitous rocks. On the 
thirtieth day the men held a council. Should they go on with this madman or compel him to turn back? 
But the iron will of their commander prevailed. The ships went on. Presently a swifter boat was sent 
ahead to spy out the course of the waterway. At last, thirty-eight days after entering the strait, Magellan 
emerged upon the Mar del Sud, the Sea of the South, to which, because of the peace of its vast waters, he 
gave the name “Pacific.” 
(The inset on the map is after a sketch of the Straits by Pigafetta, who was with Magellan. It appears in A. E. Nordenskiéld, Periplus, 1897, after the sketch in the Amoretti edition of Pigafetta, Milano, 1800.)

ESTEVAN GOMEZ SAILS NORTH 
Two years after del Cano’s return, the Portuguese, Estevan Gomez, who had deserted his commander at the 
eastern gate of Magellan Straits and had put back for home and safety, sailed to the northern coast of 
America. Gomez explored the Atlantic coast from the Penobscot River to Newfoundland. But he found 
no pearls, no gold, no spices, and no strait — only 
natives poorly dressed in furs and living precariously 
amid forbidding forests of pine. 
FRANCIS I, KING OF FRANCE, 
1494-1547 
Tue lure of the new lands and the route to Asia 
kindled the imagination of France. Francis came 
to the throne in 1515, full of ambition. The known 
world had been doubled in size during his lifetime, 
doubled and then divided between Spain and 
Portugal, with not a morsel left for France, east or 
west. He wrote sarcastically to Charles of Spain: 
“Show me, I pray you, the will of our Father, 
Adam, that I may see if he has really made you 
and the King of Portugal his universal heirs.” 
As reports reached him from America of gold, 
pearls, spices, he remarked to his courtiers: “God 
has not created those lands solely for Castilians.”     229 From the portrait, about 1536, by Titian (ca, 1477-1576), in

from Florida or Georgia to 
Nova Scotia, discovered the 
mouth of the Hudson River (to 
which he referred as “a very 
large river,” — una grandissima 
riviera), peeped into the Gulf 
of St. Lawrence, and then re- 
turned home, richer in geo- 
graphical knowledge than in 
pearls and precious stones.

CARTIER LOOKS FOR THE 
STRAIT 
Arter a humiliating defeat and imprison- 
ment at the hands of Spain, Francis once 
more bethought him of Spanish territory 
in the New World and of the strait leading 
to Asia, not by the hazardous way Magellan 
went, but by that short northwestern pas- 
sage supposed to run between America and 
Asia. From among his Norman and 
Breton fishermen, who were going yearly to 
the cod banks discovered by Cabot, 
Francis chose Jacques Cartier, ‘“‘The 
Mariner of St. Malo,” corsair and sea- 
rover, who had already made voyages to 
Brazil and to the Newfoundland Banks, 
pirating Spanish and Portuguese ships 
by the way. 
Cartier set forth and, in 1534, passed 
Newfoundland and traversed the Gulf of 
St. Lawrence. On a second voyage he 
went farther up the river, hoping that it 
was the long-sought strait. 
Cartier was the forerunner of French 
power in the New World. But his discov- 
eries did not result in the immediate set- 
ting up of a French empire in the American 
wilderness. Not until three quarters of a 
century had passed did the continuous 
history of New France begin with Cham- 
plain’s founding of Quebec in 1608.

  122 THE PAGEANT OF AMERICA 
FROBISHER AMONG THE ESKIMO 
Years of exploration served to show more clearly 
the outlines of the continent that blocked the 
way to Asia. As bay after bay on the Atlantic 
coast proved to be but an arm of the ocean, the 
chance of finding the strait was limited to the 
north. There, in quest of the northwest passage 
sailed a succession of daring seamen — Frobisher, 
Davis, Hudson, Baffin, and the rest. But the 
cold and the ice floes blocked the northward way 
to the wealth of the Indies, and Magellan’s great 
exploit could not be duplicated under the fringe 
of the polar cap. 
THE NEW WORLD 
Tuts map, one of the first to set forth the outlines 
of the new continents, appeared in Hakluyt’s edi- 
tion, 1587, of Peter Martyr’s De Orbe Novo. The 
search for the western route and other exploring 
expeditions had brought together a great body 
of information regarding the coast lines of the 
New World. The Americas stood revealed, and 
men could now set down their outlines upon 
paper. This is the first general map on which the 
name Virginia appeared.

THE FOUNDING OF NEW SPAIN 
T fell to the lot of the Spaniard to be the first to push Europe’s frontier westward 
I across the ocean. It is not strange that such should have been the case. Eight 
centuries of struggle against the Moors had bred in Spain a hardy and energetic 
military class. Over these warriors the ideals of medieval chivalry still held sway. In 
their pride and fierce courage, their prodigality and their cruelty, their readiness to 
set out upon adventures, they represent the same blend of virtues and of faults that 
everywhere characterized the medieval knight. 
But in Spain the Moorish power was broken. A national monarchy had been estab- 
lished. Frontiersman for eight centuries, the Spanish knight saw the frontier recede 
from him. The sword sheathed, chivalry’s occupation was gone. At the new court 
chances were limited and preferment went to the man of subtle intrigue and not to the 
best sword arm and the frame trained to endure the hardships of the field. On the one 
hand poverty and comparative inaction; on the other, a chance at a new frontier, a 
career worthy of the talents which the cavalier of Spain knew as his only birthright. 
The new frontier Columbus had opened. The urge toward it was as irresistible as the 
later rush for Californian gold. 
In 1493 Columbus had planted on Espafiola (Hayti) a settlement which he named 
Isabella. Twenty years later there were seventeen chartered towns on the island. 
Espafiola was thus the first frontier colony in the New World and the mother of the first 
American frontiersmen. It was chiefly a mining frontier. Under vigorous governors 
who knew the one road to kingly favor, gold mines'were worked by enslaved natives; 
and plantations of cotton and sugar were also put under cultivation. The new Land 
of Promise was rich enough to yield a fortune to every Spanish knight who had the hardi- 
hood to plunge with horse and sword and pack of slave-hunting dogs into the hills behind 
the settlements.

SANTO DOMINGO 
Santo Dominco dates from 1496. It was the capital of “Little Spain,” and for thirty years, until the gold 
failed and the natives were nearly exterminated, the center of Spanish culture in America. From its harbor 
sailed Nicuesa and Ojeda, pioneers on the Isthmus of Panama, and Juan de la Cosa, whose search for the 
Golden Fleece was ended by a poisoned arrow in Venezuela; and hence, too, sailed Velasquez and Garay to 
govern and colonize, respectively, Cuba and Jamaica. These narrow streets knew them all: Coronado, 
Ayllon, the iron De Soto, swarthy and proud, handsome Balboa, drawing all eyes, grizzled Ponce with his 
fierce Bezerillo, the most talked of dog in the city, Panfilo Narvéez, and Pizarro. Here before the house 
of the official ‘Marker of the Gold” loitered Hernando Cortés, fingering an empty purse, while Indian and 
negro slaves trooped by, bearing the shining bars down to the treasure-ships, and men gambled away the 
portions they were wait- 
ing to receive.

Friar Beaumont was a 
surgeon who later came 
to New Spain and taught 
anatomy and surgery in 
the royal hospital in 
Mexico City. The draw-

punishments which the 
conquerors meted out to 
the Indians in a less hu- 
manitarian age than ours, 
to correct such evils as 
licentiousness, murder, 
disobedience, and sorcery.

THE FOUNDING OF NEW SPAIN 125 
EMPEROR CHARLES V, 1500-1558 
Tun Spanish frontiersmen across the western ocean 
were to serve a greater empire than Ferdinand’s. In 
1516, at the age of nineteen, Charles ascended the 
throne, to be the most powerful monarch in Europe. 
Charles’ European possessions included Spain, the 
Netherlands, and Hapsburg dominions in Germany and 
Austria, Navarre, Artois, and Burgundy in France, and 
Naples, Sardinia, and Sicily in Italy. And all the New 
World was his except Brazil. With the treasure wrested 
from the New World, he paid for the wars which strength- 
ened his power in the Old. 
BEGINNING OF EUROPEAN SETTLEMENT 
ON THE AMERICAN MAINLAND 
Wirx the island of Espafiola as a center New Spain ex- 
panded year after year. New settlements appeared in 
Cuba, Porto Rico and Jamaica. The irregular coast of 
the mainland was explored and towns were established, 
Cartagena, San Sebastian, Nombre de Dios, Trujillo, 
Vera Cruz, Panuco. Expeditions plunged into the 
hinterland and, in the case of Cortés and Pizarro led to 
dazzling conquests. The “Mar del Norte” became 
dotted with the sails of galleons hurrying westward and 
eastward on courses that daily grew more familiar.

THE SPANISH ADVANCE, SIXTEENTH CENTURY 
Tue Spaniards pushed northward across Mexico and into regions which later became the United States. 
The great finds of Cortés and Pizarro lured other men to search the mountains and the deserts for gold 
and silver. Every fantastic Indian tale was eagerly listened to. Many a life and reputation were sacrificed 
in the wilderness on trails that had no end.

THE FOUNDING OF NEW SPAIN. 197 
PONCE DE LEON, 1460-1521, 
DISCOVERER OF FLORIDA 
Juan Ponce ve Leon, of whom no authentic 
portrait is known, had come with Columbus on 
the voyage of 1493. Ponce heard of an isle where 
a magic spring washed old men young. Obtain- 
ing from Charles the necessary grant, he set out 
to find the magic land. In April, 1513, Ponce 
de Leon landed on a balmy floral shore, which 
he named Florida. He explored his new “island,” 
not without Indian interference, to Pensacola 
Bay. On the way home he discovered the shel- 
tered Bahama Channel, which thereafter became 
the route for treasure ships. 
In 1521 Ponce de Leon returned to colonize 
Florida. He landed near Charlotte Harbor, but 
the Indians made such a fierce attack upon his 
forces that they had to retreat, and ere night his 
caravel was sailing homeward carrying Ponce 
mortally wounded.   
  240 From Herrera, Historia General de las Indias Occidentales, 1728 
JUAN DE GRIJALVA, WHO EXPLORED 
THE GULF COAST 
TurReExE objectives stirred the Spaniards of Santo Do- 
mingo to action: treasure, slaves, and the strait leading 
to Asia. Two colonies, San Sebastian and Nombre de 
Dios, were founded in the isthmus of Panama but did 
not endure. Grijalva was sent out by Velasquez, the 
governor of Cuba, and coasted from Yucatan to Panuco 
River. He came back with a store of gold. Grijalva was 
impressed with the scenery of the Coast he passed and 
with the fact that on the islands off the shore of the 
mainland were mounds, piled up in the form of pyra- Chrrraw WAN tf AGI) é 1 4 Grayarva dé : | mids, ascended by stone steps and each surmounted by Cuelle 
eis a temple. Obviously the natives were of no mean cul- 
tural development! The Grijalva expedition along the 
shore led directly to that of Cortés from Vera Cruz into 
the interior. In 1526, Ayllon of Espafiola sailed to the 
Carolinas with five hundred colonists, but starvation 
and disease brought death to the leader and ruin to the 
colony. By 1525 Spanish activity had made known a 
large part of the North American coast. There is no 
known authentic portrait of Grijalva.

HERNANDO CORTES, 1485-1547, 
CONQUEROR OF MEXICO 
Tur expedition of Grijalva filled Don Diego 
Velasquez with the desire for a rich conquest on 
the mainland. But he was governor of Cuba, a 
valuable territory, where he had already established 
Habana (though not on its present site), Baracoa, 
Trinidad, Puerto Principe and Santiago. His 
place, therefore, was at home. Looking around for 
someone to take the risks of expedition and to 
yield the glory to the governor, his choice fell upon 
Hernando Cortés, an adventurous young soldier, 
belonging to a noble family that had destined him 
for the law. Born in Medellin, a small town of 
Estremadura, in 1485, he was sent at fourteen 
years of age to the University of Salamanca, but he 
broke away and sought military service, in which 
he soon displayed marked skill and address. He 
was one of Velasquez’ lieutenants when Velasquez 
became governor of Cuba, and he displayed great 
ability on several trying occasions. 
THE CUBAN CAPITAL— FOUNDED 1514 
On the eve of Cortés’ departure from Santiago, 
Velasquez, accompanied by the court dwarf, ‘ 
Francisquillo, stood on the shore surveying his 242 Bronythe portrait (probably contemporary) in the Hospital de 
ships. Francisquillo, looking about, said slyly, seer eee ae 
“Have a care, Diego, Diego, lest this Estremaduran captain of yours make off with the fleet!” Into the 
ambitious soul of Velasquez entered, too late, a doubt. He sent messengers to recall Cortés, and even issued an 
order for his arrest, but the latter was in such high favor with his troops that it could not be executed, and he 
= went on with his expedition in 
spite of the governor. He reached 
land on March 4, 1519, and ad- 
vanced along the Mexican coast, 
overawing the natives who 
sent ambassadors with presents. 
Cortés thus learned that there 
was in the interior a native sov- 
ereign called Montezuma, who 
ruled an extensive empire. The 
news so excited Cortés’ ambi- 
tion that he decided to attempt 
the conquest of that empire. 
He founded Vera Cruz, caused 
himself to be elected captain- 
general of the new colony, 
burned his vessels to show his 
soldiers that they must conquer 
or perish, and began his march 
toward the city of Mexico, 
where Montezuma lived.

THE FOUNDING OF NEW SPAIN 
THE AZTEC OVERLORD, 
MONTEZUMA II, 1466-1520 
“Monrezuma is lord of many kings; his equal is 
not known in all the world: in his house many 
lords serve barefooted with eyes cast down to the 
ground. . . . Montezuma dwells in the most beau- 
tiful, the largest, and the strongest city in the 
world —a city built in the water. ... Hither 
flock princes from all the earth, bringing incaleu- 
lable riches. No lord however great is there who 
does not pay tribute, and no one so poor is there 
who does not give at least the blood of his arm.” 
Thus spoke the Totonac chief, Olintetl, enemy of 
Montezuma, who received Cortés in friendly 
fashion at Cempoalla, north of Vera Cruz. 
AZTEC ARTISTS PICTURE THE 
ARRIVAL OF THE SPANISH 
Tue news was carried apace to Montezuma that 
gods in guise of men, who bestrode fierce swift 
animals, and carried thunder in their hands, had 
come to land from “floating towers in the waters 
of heaven.” Aztec artists pictured for their 
amazed lord ‘the ships, the horses, the cannon, and 
the bearded Spaniards.

CORTES’ MARCH TO MONTEZUMA’S CAPITAL 
Vera Crvz lies in the hot lowlands, the Tierra Calienta. Cortés plunged into the tropical forest and crossed 
the narrow coastal plain. He then climbed a steep escarpment down which the rivers tumble in great falls. 
Each day of ascent brought a cooler and more invigorating climate. Finally he reached the high plateau, 
surrounded by a ring of mountains where then, as now, lived the greater part of the Mexican people.

CORTES MEETS THE EMBASSY OF MONTEZUMA 
THE strange gods, Montezuma learned, were hungry for gold. Therefore, thought he, let them be given gold 
enough to content them, so that they will go away. But the two great cartwheels of gold and silver, the 
embroidered cottons, the jeweled feathers, the helmet filled with gold dust from Montezuma’s storehouse only 
strengthened Hernando’s purpose to conquer the land and to possess its treasures. Cortés learned that the 
Aztecs held sway over conquered tribes and pueblos whose people were intensely hostile toward their over- 
lords. The subject Indians not only paid tribute but, at the time of their conquest, had seen their young men 
and maidens taken away to the capital city, Tenochtitlan, where most of the men and some of the women 
became sacrifices to satisfy the blood lust of the Aztec war god. Cortés sensed the fear and hatred of the 
subject peoples. He posed as their deliverer. Passing one after another of the subject cities on the plateau, 
Cortés marched straight for the center of Aztec power. His allies increased in number and enthusiasm. 
When he reached Tenochtitlan, Montezuma dared not call out the Aztec warriors to oppose him openly.

Corrfs would not be bribed by these gifts to depart, nor would he be put off from an audience with Monte- 
zuma. He learned that the Aztec empire was shot through with dissension and filled with allies of the 
enemies of Montezuma. He pushed on as rapidly as possible over the path by which the gold and silver 
cart wheels had come and, on November 8, 1519, he entered the city. In the street now named El Rastro, 
Montezuma met him, clad in a robe of sky blue, shod with golden sandals, and holding crimson roses in 
his hand. It was as high priest of the War God that the Indian met the Spaniard.

TENOCHTITLAN, THE CITY OF 
MEXICO 
TenocuTITLANn, which Cortés entered as guest, 
god, and conqueror-to-be was a city of perhaps 
70,000 souls, spreading over two marshy islands 
at the western end of Lake Tezcuco. Three 
long causeways supplied with sluice-gates con- 
nected it, west, north, and south, with the 
mainland. Bridged canals intersected the four 
quarters of the town. In the center was the 
great square, entered by four gates in a high 
stone wall ornamented with serpents. The 
square was the place of trade, of festivals, and 
merrymaking, and of human sacrifice. There 
were four principal types of buildings — huge 
commercial dwellings of one or two stories, 
tecpans or government offices surmounted by 
observation towers, “houses of darts” or 
armories, and pyramidal temple structures. 
All were built of reddish stone covered with 
white stucco so brilliant that the Spaniards at 
first believed the city to be made of silver.

THE GRAND TEMPLE OF 
MEXICO 
Frarrut gods were worshipped in Ten- 
ochtitlan. Chief among them was the 
war-god, Huitzilopochtli, to whom thou- 
sands of victims were sacrificed annually. 
Captives in war, the choicest youths and 
maids of vassal provinces, were driven up 
the stairs of the rude stone pyramid of 
the war-god’s temple, which towered above 
the great square. The priests seized the 
victims, tore out their hearts with stone 
knives, and flung the bodies down for the 
cannibal rites. Herrera’s sketch is fanci- 
ful. The Spaniards completely destroyed 
the temple.

Aw Aztec painter pictures here, primitively, but realistically, three methods of sacrifice. First (No. 252) is 
the arrow sacrifice, where the victim, bound to posts within the wooden oratory atop the pyramid, is shot 
through the heart by an arrow. The second (No. 253) is the gladiatorial sacrifice, in which the victim is 
allowed a wooden sword. The third (No. 255) is the sacrifice by tearing out the heart, which has already 
(p. 132) been described. The hearts of the slaughtered were placed in carved stone vases. The knife for the 
sacrifice had a blade of obsidian and a handle of 
wood encrusted with mosaics.

Tue Aztecs had developed many of the arts to a high 
degree. Among musical instruments they had long 
drums and shell rattles (No. 257), also flutes of reed

THE AZTEC SENATE 
Montezuma’s palace consisted of hundreds of rooms built around three open squares — a structure so 
vast, says one of the Spaniards, that he wandered about 
it four times till he was tired, and yet had not seen all of it. 
Practically the whole machinery of government was housed 
under the king’s roof. Here met the Aztec senate, consisting 
of the nobles of the land. Here the judge held court, the 
supreme court of the country, for other cities had their 
lower courts. The criminal code was barbarously severe, 
death by some horrible torture being the penalty for a small 
offense. 
AZTEC WARRIOR WITH CAPTIVES 
Aw Aztec warrior in all his glory was a formidable spectacle. 
He is here pictured, from a relief carved on stone, with orna- 
mented head-dress and standard, with captives crouching at 
his feet, with dead foes’ heads at his belt — a flower dangling 
below one of them — and a loin cloth or skirt of jaguar’s skin. 
His foot covering recalls that of Greek and Roman soldiers. 
The tassels on his cape indicate that he has already distin- 
guished himself before this campaign by the capture of enemy 
hearts for Huitzilopochtli. Practically all the able-bodied men 
among the Aztecs, save the priests, were warriors. There 
were rough grades among them based on prowess in battle. 
The Aztec conquerors of the tribes on the Mexican plateau 
were the Romans among the American Indians.

ARMS OF THE AZTECS 
Tur Aztec warrior’s weapons — bow, bone-tipped arrows, 
sling, obsidian or bronze spearheads and javelins, stone 
tomahawk, and heavy clubs, plain or studded with stone 
spikes — were, however, no match for Cortés’ cannon. The 
Aztec science of war was better at fortifications than in 
tactics. 
SCULPTURED FACE OF QUETZALCOATL, 
THE FAIR GOD 
Beuievine that Cortés might possibly be the Fair God 
who, according to the ancient tradition, was to return 
over the water from 
the East, Monte- 
zuma hesitated to 
offend him. Cortés, 
however, lost no time 
in imprisoning _ his 
host, who was later 
slain on the parapet of 
his palace by his own 
people. Cortés cap- 
tured some of the war 
chiefs of the outlying 
districts as well as 
some of the chief men

eracy. He then forbade human sacrifice. The Aztec war chiefs who 
remained at large took command and roused their people to resist 
the invader. 
  263 From T. A. Joyce, Mexican Archeology, 1914, courtesy of G. P. Putnam's Sons   
THE “TREE OF THE DOLEFUL NIGHT” 
Ar this point in his enterprise Cortés received a 
blow from behind. Don Diego Velasquez, deeply of- 
fended by the arrogant proceedings of Cortés, sent 
a force under Panfilo Narvdez to take him prisoner. 
Narvaez, through his emissaries, offered to support 
the Aztecs. Cortés therefore divided his army, leav- 
ing part in Tenochtitlan under Alvarado, and with 
the rest marched against Narvéez. Cortés brought 
him back a prisoner and along with him most of Don 
Diego’s second expedition, which he had won over to 
himself as he had already won the first. Alvarado, 
meanwhile, roused by tales of conspiracy, without 
warning set upon the Mexicans celebrating a religious 
festival and massacred them ruthlessly. Cortés, re- 
turning, found the Aztecs fully roused to their danger. 
For a space he remained in the capital, then, by 
night, sought to steal out over the causeway with the 
fewest sluiceways. The move was discovered. A 
desperate fight occurred where a bridge over the 
sluiceway had been removed. With a loss of four 
hundred and fifty killed and captured, Cortés escaped. 
It was the noche triste, the “ doleful night.”

THE VICTORY OF CORTES AT OTUMBA 
Tue Aztecs pursued the Spaniards to the mainland but were beaten off in a fierce scrimmage called the battle 
of Otumba, July 7, 1520. Cortés thereupon prepared to retake the city. He made friends with the vassal 
peoples, who hated their Aztec lords; he set guards at the road to Vera Cruz as a protection against Don 
Diego; and he constructed a fleet of shallow boats. In May, 1521, with nine hundred Spaniards, thousands 
of native allies, eighty-six horses, and eighteen guns, Cortés began the siege of Tenochtitlan by land and water, 
ard on the 18th of August entered the city.

which would presently pro- 
voke rivalry against Cortés, 
was under way in Central 
America. Pedrarias de 
Avilahad arrived in Darienas 
governor in 1514, and three 
years later, after quarrels 
and reconciliations with Bal- 
boa, had beheaded him on 
the charge of treason. In 
1519, the year in which 
Cortés founded Vera Cruz, 
Pedrarias established Pan- 
ama and made it his capital. (BAG ae

NOMBRE DE DIOS, PORT OF THE SPANISH TREASURE FLEET 
Peprarias refounded Nombre de Dios — first planted by Nicuesa and subsequently abandoned — and 
opened a road to the Pacific, a road to become historic because of the wealth of gold, silver, and jewels which 
would be transported over it. Pedrarias then cast an avaricious eye upon the territory north of Darien. 
Cortés, however, was also looking at it southward from Mexico. Under Pedrarias’ banner, Gil Gonzalez 
Davila and Andrés Nino explored Nicaragua and returned to report thirty-two thousand baptisms and to 
exhibit thousands of dollars worth of pea and gold. Pedrarias now set about conquering Nicaragua for 
himself, with the assistance of Hernando de Soto and 
Pizarro, and, in 1527, he was made governor of that 
province. Meanwhile, in Guatemala and Honduras agents

the better of his rival and spread his conquests over the 
disputed territory and Yucatan. 
FRANCISCO PIZARRO BEFORE CHARLES V 
Pizarro was born in Estremadura, the illegitimate son of 
an army officer. As a youth, he made his way across the 
Atlantic to New Spain. In the rough and tumble of life in 
America he pushed himself forward until he gained an 
opportunity to explore the unknown western coast of South 
America. Reports of a great empire situated in the moun- 
tains he succeeded in verifying. Unable to influence the 
colonial governor, however, he went to Spain to plead his 
cause with the emperor. His request was granted and he 
returned to America armed with the powers of a viceroy 
over the lands to be conquered.     ainting, exhibited at the Exposition, , 1881, by Angel Lizcano (1846-)

PIZARRO’S FIRST SIGHT OF 
THE INCA EMPIRE 
In the autumn of 1532 Pizarro led his little army up 
the rocky heigltts of the Andes until he could look 
down into the protected valley where the Peruvian 
Incas ruled. His force seemed small indeed for the 
conquest of the populous cities that lay below him. 
THE INCA, ATAHUALPA, 
LAST KING OF PERU 
WueEn the Spaniard dragged his army over the gigantic 
Andean wall, he knew very little of the extent of the 
Peruvian empire or of the numbers of its warriors. 
He knew only that gold was there in amounts, it was 
to be hoped, far exceeding the Aztec treasure. In 
November, at Caxamarca, Pizarro met Atahualpa, the 
¢ 5 Inca, child of the sun. Scornful of the dusty little 
Meee tute AtanentaN res Rae band of travel-worn Spaniards and secure in his own 
ae divinity, Atahualpa, attended by nobles in blue gar- 
ments with metal broideries — and but a handful of 
warriors — gave Pizarro a haughty greeting. Pizarro 
and the Inca chieftain supped together, then the Span- 
iard suddenly made the Indian prisoner. The native 
courtiers were too dazed to offer resistance. Ata- 
hualpa’s lot was hard. Though in captivity, by one 
means and another he sought to oppose the Spaniards. 
Finally he was brought to a trial which in itself was a 
farce, as the decision to kill him had already been made. 
His end came in August, 1533, when, in the plaza of 
Caxamarca, he was strangled with a bowstring.

PERUVIAN ARTS AND CRAFTS 
Tue Peruvian civilization was of a higher type than the Aztec. It bore a certain analogy to the Persian; its 
religion was sun-worship; its government was despotic, with all authority centralized in Cuzco and in the 
person of the Inca, and enforced by means of governors, garrisons, military highways, and the Quichua lan- 
guage of the rulers, which was imposed on all conquered peoples. The caste system prevailed. 
In the arts the Peruvians excelled, especially in weaving, in pottery, and in metal work. They compesed 
dramas, poems and hymns, and their musical instruments were numerous. The cyclopean architecture of the 
Incas was superior to all other examples of the same type, and their fitted and polished stonework was unsur- 
passed. They were better husbandmen and better engineers than even their conquerors. They raised corn 
and vegetables and cotton. They had domesticated the llama, which provided wool for garments which 
they made in many beautiful patterns and various colors. They smelted gold and silver ore from 
which they made decorated armor and intricate jewelry. They displayed an infinite variety of design in 
their work with metals and as potters. As cultivators of the soil and as engineers they were superior to 
the Spaniards who conquered them. They built roads with post houses which ran for hundreds of miles 
over deserts and the roughest mountain ranges. 
THE QUIPUS, 
A PERUVIAN KNOT RECORD 
Tue Peruvians had no writing as the Mayas and 
the Aztecs had. The Spaniards found them keep- 
ing their records with knotted cords known as the 
quipus. The base of the quipus was a heavy 
cord some two feet in length from which a series 
of knotted strings hung like the fringe of a gar- 
ment. There were white strings signifying silver 
or sometimes peace, yellow strings for gold, and 
red ones for war. The number and size of the 
knots and their distance from one another all had 
meanings. In this way the Inca kept a rough 
record of births and deaths and even of the events 
in the history of the tribe. Couriers ran from the 
central capital to the chiefs of outlying provinces 
carrying orders knotted in quipus. Perhaps it was 
used when strange white men mounted on strange 
animals suddenly invaded the mountain empire.

PIZARRO, THE CONQUEROR 
OF PERU, ca. 1471 or 1475-1541 | 
ATAHUALPA, to gain his freedom, offered 
to fill a room of the palace with gold and 
a smaller room twice with silver. In 
three months Pizarro had collected gold 
objects worth a fortune. In August, 
1533, Atahualpa was murdered and Pi- 
zarro, his little army of 183 men and 27 
horses somewhat reinforced, marched to 
Cuzco, which he entered in November. 
In 1536 the Inca made a determined 
attempt to drive out the foreign invader. 
For two months they besieged the Span- 
iards in Cuzco before relief came to the 
defenders. Then the Europeans fell to 
fighting one another for the booty of 
Peru. Pizarro and his disgruntled 
lieutenants made peace, broke peace, and 
then embraced again. On June 26, 1541, 
the gray conqueror, 63 years old now, 
was alone in the government house and 
unarmed. A score of the malcontents 
suddenly rushed upon him and hacked 
him down. With his blood Pizarro traced 
across on the floor, kissed it, and died.

  PANFILO NARVAEZ, ca. 1480-1528, 
ILL-FATED GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA 
Meanwuite, Panfilo Narvdez — tall, red-bearded, 
one-eyed — obtained from Charles V in 1527 a grant to 
Florida. He was to colonize, to convert, to seek the 
Strait, to bear the title of “‘Adelantado,” all at his own 
expense. On April 14, 1528, Narvaez landed at St. 
Clement’s Point, north of Tampa Bay. In a deserted 
Indian hut he found a little golden ornament. No 
more was needed to lure him onward in the search for 
treasure. 
For three months Narvaéez and his three hundred 
men. plunged through the Florida forests, beset by 
mire and morass, by hunger and Indians. In Septem- 
ber they camped at Appalachee Bay, and here they 
built five boats as best they could. They killed their 
horses for food, preserved the leg skins entire for water- 
bottles, and used the tails and manes for ropes. 
Setting sail from the “Bay of Horses,” two boats went 
ashore on the Texas coast, and the men in the other 
boats were captured and killed by Indians. Narvaez’ 
boat was lost in a storm.

CABEZA DE VACA IN 
THE DESERT 
CaBEza DE Vaca and eighty men of Narvaez’ 
colony, hungry, sick, and shivering in the 
November cold, were cared for by friendly 
Indians on an island now thought to be 
Galveston. By spring all but fifteen had died, 
and the living were soon scattered. Only 
Vaca and one other were left on the island; 
the others were taken away by Indians from 
the mainland. Vaca gained the confidence of 
his masters and was presently trusted to 
carry articles of trade to the mainland tribes. 
On his journeys he always sought news of the 
West and of the nature and extent of the 
territory between him and Mexico, for to 
Mexico he had resolved eventually to go. 
He waited six years for his timid companion, 
Oviedo, to dare the venture with him, and, 
when at last they had gone a hundred miles, 
Oviedo ran back. Vaca, however, kept 
steadfastly on. Happily he encountered two 
Spaniards, Dorantes and Castillo, and a 
Christianized Moor, Estevanico, the remnant 
of those taken away by the mainland Indians 
several years before, and the reunited four 
pressed on together.

  VACA’S BOOK ON HIS TRAVELS 
Vaca’s medical skill, his cures by prayer and his unselfish 
character, impressed the savages so deeply that they passed 
him and his friends in safety from tribe to tribe, fed, clothed 
and guarded them. 
Vaca thus traversed the sand belt between the Nueces and 
the Rio Grande, and crossing the river pressed on to Chi- 
huahua. He crossed the sub-arid grasslands of northern 
Mexico. He made his way through the great mountain 
barrier now known as Sierra Madre Occidental. He trav- 
ersed nearly half the length of the Sonora desert, skirting 
the foothills at the western base of the mountains. 
At last he reached a Spanish outpost of Sinoloa after one of 
the most remarkable land journeys of the century. Vaca 
thereafter went home to Spain and wrote an account of his 
wanderings. This was the first book about America by a 
traveler. Of his cures by prayer he wrote: “Our method 
was to bless the sick, breathing upon them, and recite a 
Pater-noster and an Ave Maria, praying with all earnest- 
ness to God our Lord that he would give health and influ- 
ence them to make us some good return.”

HERNANDO DE SOTO, 1496?-1542 
THE DISCOVERER OF THE MISSISSIPPI 
Hernanvo bE Soro, unlike many of his companions, had 
returned from Peru with honor unsullied and with so much 
wealth that he was able to ingratiate himself with Charles 
by lending money to that monarch, who conferred on him 
the governorship of Florida. In that wild region, where 
Narvaez had failed to find another Mexico, de Soto now 
set out to seek another Peru. Vaca’s return, with a handful 
of turquoise and with Indian tales of silver cities and 
jeweled doors, sent de Soto’s countrymen flocking to his 
standard. Nobles sold their castles and estates to join him, 
and his nine ships could not hold them all. 
DE SOTO AT THE MISSISSIPPI, 1542 
De Soro and his companions forced their way through 
what is now Florida, Georgia, Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, 
and Mississippi. In May, 1541, near Chickasaw Bluffs, de 
Soto reined in on the east bank of the Mississippi. (The 
line of this historic march through the wilderness is indi- 
cated in the map on page 126.) Hunger, disease, and Indian 
hostility had thinned his band to half its original number. THE FOUNDING OF NEW SPAIN

THE BURIAL OF HERNANDO DE SOTO 
De Soro’s men built barges, crossed the Mississippi, and marched on into Arkansas and Oklahoma. Then, 
discouraged, they turned back. Again in May, a year later, they were on the bank of the great river. And 
here, Hernando, convinced at last of defeat, fell into a fever and soon died. His little band of followers were 
fearful of attack from the Indians, if it became known their leader was dead. In the blackness of night de 
Soto’s body was taken from concealment, sewed in fur “shawls,” weighted with stones, and sunk in the depths 
of the river. Luis de Moscoso, designated their commander by de Soto, now led his men into Texas in futile 
search of a way out, and then back to the Mississippi, where he set them to building brigantines. In their 
rudely constructed fleet, they floated down the river, crossed the Gulf, and made Mexico in safety. 
THE FIGHT AT THE ZUNI PUEBLO, 1539 
In search of a western entrance to the Strait of Anian, Fray Marcos de Niza, a Franciscan, set out in 
1539 with an Indian band and the Moor, Estevanico, bound for New Mexico — where rose the fabled 
Seven Cities of Cibola. The frontier passed, Estivanico was sent ahead to find the route, and as he 
went he came to the Zufi 
pueblo of Hawaikih. The 
new-comers were well re- 
ceived by the wondering 
Indians. Gifts and tribute 
were brought to the Moor. 
But the mood of the bar- 
barian redskins changed. 
“The sun was about a lance 
high” when the people of 
Hawaikth let fly with 
arrows and stones upon the 
invaders. The Moor’s army, 
fleeing, looked back and 
thought they saw him fall.

CORONADO’S MARCH THROUGH THE SOUTHWEST 
Tue reports of Fray Marcos incited Coronado, Governor of the Mexican frontier, to assemble an army at 
Compostela in February, 1540, with three hundred nobles and a thousand Indians. Coronado, in the second 
week in July, reached Hawaikth, which he captured after a sharp fight. Great was the general rage and 
disappointment when this silver city of Fray Marcos’ description was entered and explored. But captives 
told Coronado of richer cities further on. He crossed the Texas plains on his futile search and then went

    north to Great Bend, Kansas, where he set up a cross 
and turned back. After two years he reached Mexico 
again, poorer in spirit and wiser in experience. “He lost 
his reputation, and shortly thereafter his government of 
New Galicia” tersely states Castafieda, the historian with 
the expedition. 
DON ANTONIO DE MENDOZA, 
FIRST VICEROY OF NEW SPAIN, 1480-1552 
Awnronio DE Mernpoza, who had been sent out in 1535 as 
Viceroy of Mexico or New Spain, as it was called, was an 
ambitious, energetic man. He had received Vaca and had 
been inspired by his story to send out Fray Marcos, 
Alargon, and Coronado. The failure of Coronado did 
not daunt him. 
In June, 1542, he sent a Portuguese mariner, Cabrillo, 
and two ships up the west coast and, in November, 
despatched an expedition “West towards China or the 
Spice Islands,” under Villalobos. Villalobos took posses- 
sion of the Philippines but died on his journey. Cabrillo 
discovered the bay of San Diego and the northern harbor 
later called Drake’s Bay. He, too, died on the voyage. 
But Ferrelo, his pilot, continued north as far as Rogue 
River, Oregon, and then turned home, without having 
found the Strait of Anian.

        CHAPTER VII 
FRENCH DEFIANCE IN FLORIDA 
PAIN had established the centers of her American empire in the West Indies, on 
S the Isthmus of Darien and in Mexico. From Mexico the Spaniard had steadily 
pushed northward toward the regions that came to be known as Texas and 
California. But Spanish claims did not end with the southern areas of the continent. 
They extended indefinitely to the north. So, when the news came to the West Indies 
that a party of Huguenots from France were planning a settlement on the western 
shore of the Atlantic not far north of Cuba, the Spaniards were bound to bestir them- 
selves. In spite of more than one exploring expedition the Spaniard had failed to estab- 
lish himself on the mainland of North America either in Florida or northward. The reason 
was not hard to find. The gold and silver which was the life of New Spain did not exist 
on the Atlantic coast plain which Ponce de Leon and others had explored. New Spain 
was, therefore, not well prepared to meet an invasion of this region by the French. 
The Huguenots were Frenchmen who had come under the influence of the Protestant 
movement that had originated in Germany in the sixteenth century. René de Laudon- 
niére was a Huguenot who, in June, 1564, led a fleet to what is now the coast of Carolina. 
Most of the people with him were folk of the new Protestant faith and they came to 
found a colony in the New World. 
But Laudonniére was merely carrying out the work which Jean Ribaut of Dieppe, 
a seaman of renown, had begun. Two years before, he had crossed the sea to explore the 
American coast and had sighted land near the present St. Augustine. He had nosed 
his way northward along the shore until he came to what seemed to him a great river 
which he called the “River of May” because it chanced to be May Day when he entered 
the estuary. It isnow known as the St. John’s. Landing here, the Frenchmen found the re- 
gion “the fairest, fruitfulest, and pleasantest of all the world.” They believed that the 
famed Cibola with its seven cities was but twenty days’ journey away. Leaving the 
River of May without attempting to reach the Seven Cities, Ribaut skirted the coast 
to the northward and finally turned east to France. He left at Port Royal Sound a force 
of thirty volunteers to hold the land. But hunger and mutiny broke up the colony. 
Killing their leaders, the mutineers put to sea in a rough boat they had shaped, and under- 
took the desperate adventure of a voyage across the Atlantic. 
Laudonniére, coming out with a fleet in 1564, was attempting to advance the French 
claim which Ribaut had established. But the colonists were taking grave risks. They 
were trespassing on soil claimed by a rival nation, and most of them belonged to the 
Protestant faith, between which and the Church which Spain defended was a growing 
enmity. They must expect to fight to maintain their foothold.

ADMIRAL OF FRANCE, 1519-72 
Couteny, a distinguished soldier, and a man of noble Burgun- 
dian family, was made Admiral of France in 1552 at the age of 
thirty-three. We do not know at what date he joined the 
Huguenots; John Calvin’s first letter to him was written in 
1558. Four years later the religious wars broke out. The party 
of the Guises and the Queen-Mother, Catherine de Medici, 
strove to eradicate Protestantism as representing primarily a 
new political power. In 1572 occurred the Massacre of St. 
Bartholomew, in which Coligny fell. 
THE HUGUENOTS, LED BY JEAN RIBAUT, 
LAND IN FLORIDA, 1562 
To revive the fallen glory of France, to protect his co-religion- 
ists, and to strike a blow at Spain were Coligny’s three chief aims. 
In the first he had all Frenchmen with him. On French maps 
of the New World there was a tract marked, since Verrazano’s 
time, “Terre des Bretons.” This was, approximately, Nova 
Scotia; but so vague were current notions of geography that 
the French may have thought it included Florida, territory 
which had been recently declared by Spaniards unfit for white 
habitation. To Florida Coligny dispatched a colony composed 
chiefly of Huguenots, under Jean Ribaut of Dieppe.

homewards in a ship which they could not manage, and were at last picked up by an English vessel. 
In 1564 Coligny sent a second colony under Laudonniére which landed at St. John’s River and built Fort 
Caroline. Here Saturiba, an Indian chief, led Laudonniére in state to Ribaut’s column to show him the gar- 
lands and offerings of maize with which his tribe had honored it. For lack of adaptability this French colony 
also starved in fruitful Florida and was about to depart in a ship purchased from the English seaman, John 
Hawkins, when, in August, 1565, Ribaut opportunely arrived with supplies and more colonists and soldiers. 
THE BUILDING OF FORT CAROLINE 
Lavuponnimre, enchanted with the land in which he had established his colony, wrote a description, touched 
  with imagination and phi- 
losophy, of “‘cedars red as 
blood” and “‘bay trees of 
so sovereign an odor that 
balm smells nothing like 
in comparison,” in short, 
of a place “so pleasant 
that those which are mel- 
ancholic would be en- 
forced to change their 
humor.” In the midst of 
this pleasant prospect, the 
French built Fort Caro- 
line. The fortification was 
needed, for the Spaniards 
sent their treasure ships 
home through the Ba- 
hama channel and were 
bound to attempt to wipe 
out a French settlement, 
so placed that it could be 
used as a refuge and base 
for privateers preying on 
the silver galleons.

Putuip was as fanatical about his own power and glory as he was about 
his religion. As Spanish king no less than as royal Catholic, he felt 
that Protestantism was a wicked rebellion that must at all costs be put 
down. To Spain the presence of = 
armed Frenchmen and “Lutheran 
heretics” in Florida was an insult 
unendurable and a political threat 
to be promptly answered. King 
Philip ordered Pedro Menéndez de 
Avilés, an able naval commander 
fanatically loyal to Crown and 
Church, to extirpate the French 
from Florida and found in their 
stead a Spanish colony. On August

Ribaut himself was ashore. Menéndez 
sailed into the midst of the French, 
determined on battle before reinforce- 
ments should arrive. His trumpets 
sounded a salute; the French trumpets 
responded. Menéndez’s San Pelayo now 
lay alongside Ribaut’s Trinity. “‘Gentle- 
men, from where does this fleet come?” 
“From France,” answered a voice from 
the Trinity. “What are you doing here?” 
The voice answered that the French were 
building a fort for the King of France. 
“Are you Catholics or Lutherans?” 
“Lutherans, and our general is Jean 
Ribaut.” Menéndez thereupon ordered 
his men to draw swords and board. But 
the Normans, more agile seamen than 
their foes, cut their cables and made out 
to sea unscathed. ae et

a cross and chanting the Te Deum, advanced to meet him. Menéndez now took formal possession in the 
Spanish king’s name. Mass was celebrated. During these ceremonies two of Ribaut’s ships, which had fled 
through the Spanish fleet at St. John’s River and had then turned and followed it, appeared at the mouth of 
the harbor and challenged the San Pelayo and the San Salvator, anchored outside the bar because they were 
too large to cross it safely. Menéndez’s vessels, however, refused the combat, and the French sailed away. 
ST. AUGUSTINE — PLAN OF THE FIRST SPANISH FORT 
MENéNDEZ was in- 
structed to establish 
fortified towns one 
of whose functions 
would be to protect 
the Bahama channel. 
The fort at St. Au- 
gustine was begun 
with the founding of 
the colony. The po- 
sition was well chosen 
and strongly main- 
tained. So it hap- 
pened that St. Au- 
gustine became the 
first permanent town 
within the bounda- 
ries of what is now 
the United States.

THE MASSACRE OF THE FRENCH 
Rrsavt, conscious of the Spanish peril, set sail for St. Augustine but was blown out to sea by a storm, Me- 
néndez, equally active, marched overland, surprised Fort Caroline, and killed all but a handful of the small 
garrison that Ribaut had left. Then came the news of the wreck of two of the French ships at Matanzas. 
Losing no time, the Spanish commander marched to the spot and by fair promises disarmed and bound the 
one hundred and forty survivors. Going ahead of them, he drew a line in the sand behind a dune. Dusk was 
falling when the shipwrecked party reached the mark. The rising sun next day saw their headless bodies 
already attracting carrion birds. Later Ribaut and the rest of the French, who also met with shipwreck at 
the same place, were hacked to death beside the same bloody mark in the sand.

PHILIP RECEIVING AN EMBASSY 
To Philip wrote Menéndez: “They came and surrendered their arms to me, and I had their hands tied behind 
them, and put them all excepting ten (Catholics) to the sword.” And on the back of Menéndez’ report 
Philip scrawled: ‘As to those he has killed, he has done well, and as to those he has saved, they shall be sent 
to the galleys.” To Menéndez he wrote: “‘ We hold that we have been well served.” 
GOURGUES’ ATTACK ON SAN MATEO 
Tue victorious Spaniards changed the name of Fort Caroline to San Mateo. In 1568, Gourgues, an ex-soldier 
of France, landed quietly in Florida, made an alliance with the chief Saturiba, and fell upon San Mateo with 
the aid of his Indian allies. 
Against this attack the 
cannon in the fort were 
of no avail. As many as 
possible of the garrison 
were taken alive. 
When Gourgues left, 
their bodies swung from 
the branches of the south- 
ern forest. Gourgues said 
they were executed “not 
as Spaniards” but ‘as 
traitors, robbers and mur- 
derers.” The expedition 
was an act of private 
revenge which led neither 
to war nor to the estab- 
lishment of permanent 
French settlements in the 
neighborhood of the Ba- 
hama channel.

  THE EARLIEST VIEW OF 
ST. AUGUSTINE 
Tue Mestas map may now be found among pa- 
pers which were carried to Spain in 1594-95 by 
Hernando de Mestas. Mestas had been sent by the 
Florida colony to the Spanish court to plead for many 
things the colony wanted, particularly new fortifica- 
tions. Because of the fact that it was taken to Spain 
under such circumstances, the map has usually been 
dated 1595. J 
Recent research has unearthed evidence which 
strongly points to a date perhaps as much as thirty 
years earlier. The enlarged section of the map here 
reproduced may represent the St. Augustine that 
Menéndez knew. Before the rough church is a 
curious device for holding the chimes. Beside the 
wharf is a small protecting fort just beyond the end 
of which a bell is hung from an upright — perhaps 
for sounding the alarm in time of war or fire. Behind 
the wharf and to the right is a house for the governor. 
The squares in the background are the cultivated 
fields. The map remains the earliest authentic 
representation of St. Augustine, Florida.

CHAPTER VIII 
ENGLAND’S CHALLENGE TO SPAIN 
PAIN grew in power as a result of the riches her galleons brought across the 
S Atlantic from Nombre de Dios and Vera Cruz. Other factors contributed to 
make her at times in the sixteenth century the most powerful nation in Europe. 
Unswervingly Spain upheld the ancient faith. She sent her missionaries to convert the 
conquered peoples in America and set her face steadily against the Protestants of Europe. 
England under the Protestant Elizabeth became the chief of her enemies. 
It happened that Spain’s day of greatness coincided with England’s. The nation 
north of the Channel was no longer a wholly agricultural and fishing people. Long 
before Elizabeth’s time they had begun to send traders into far distant regions. English- 
men were pooling their capital in joint-stock companies that were trading in Europe and 
even in central Russia and the Levant. In the Elizabethan era this commercial 
development came into full flower, and a new wealth poured into London and the lesser 
cities. The laden Spanish galleons ploughing eastward across the Atlantic from Mexico 
and Darien were at once a threat and an opportunity. 
Elizabethan England was fully alive to the Spanish menace. Never before had the 
English people produced such a brilliant array of leaders. The mariners who became 
famous for trading and for their depredations in the Spanish Main found their counter- 
part in the statesmen and the men of letters. Richard Hakluyt began his collections of 
narratives of exploration in unknown lands and Walter Raleigh began to dream of an 
English empire in America. 
Of such quality was the England that Philip II of Spain faced. He saw English 
buccaneers, increasing in numbers with the years, prowl along the sea routes that the 
galleons traveled, every now and then cutting out a rich ship. Though the two nations 
were at peace the English carried their attack to the Spanish ports in North America. 
War was the inevitable result. England had challenged Spain’s monopoly of the western 
hemisphere and the two must fight it out for a place in the New World.

QUEEN ELIZABETH, 
1533-1603 
E1izaBetu had the fortune to rule in a day 
of England’s greatness. Never before had the 
island kingdom produced such a wealth of men 
of ability and daring. Merchants were trading 
to the far corners of the earth; adventurers 
were seeking plunder in the Spanish Main 
and new routes to the Orient; men of letters 
were writing dramas, poems and essays that 
have enriched the literature of the world. 
Elizabeth was a great figure in a great age. 
“Nothing, nothing, no worldly thing under 
the sun, is so dear to me as the love and good 
will of my subjects,” she said to her first 
Parliament. All her gifts were devoted to 
rallying the nation to the support of the throne 
as the best means of promoting prosperity and 
security. 
When the test came, in 1588, the Spanish 
Armada found the English invincible. From 
that date Elizabeth more and more withdrew 
from her people, but the prosperity and bril- 
liance of her reign continued to its end in 
1603. So well had England’s world position 
been established that only four years after the 
passing of the great queen, the first permanent 
English colony was founded on the continent 
of North America.

SIR JOHN HAWKINS, 1532-95 
In 1562 John Hawkins, the son of an English merchant, 
formed a joint-stock company for trade with the Spaniards. 
His first trip out was made in three small vessels. An old 
account gives the following story. ‘‘At Teneriffe he re- 
ceived friendly treatment. From thence he passed to 
Sierra Leona, where he stayed a good time, and got into 
his possession, partly by the sword and partly by other 
means, to the number of 300 Negroes at the least, besides 
other merchandises. . . . With this prey he sailed over the 
ocean sea unto the island of Hispaniola [Hayti] . . . and 
here had reasonable utterance [sale] of his English com- 
modities, as also of some part of his Negroes, trusting the 
Spaniards no further than by his own strength he was able 
to still master them.” He sold all his negroes and with a 
load of hides, ginger, sugar and some pearls started for 
home. Queen Elizabeth made him a knight, and gave 
him a coat of arms with the crest: “A demi-Moor, bound 
and captive.” Sir John Hawkins was one of the most 
daring mariners of his time. He led the way in the English 
attack upon the Spanish monopoly of the trade with the 
West Indies and the mainland of America.

ENGLAND’S CHALLENGE TO SPAIN 
MARTIN FROBISHER, ca. 1535-94 
Martin Fropisuer as early as 1560 had formed a resolution 
to look for a northwest passage to Cathay. One of his com- 
panions on his first voyage, writing in 1578, says Captain 
Frobisher is “‘thoroughly furnished of the knowledge of the 
sphere, . .. and being persuaded of a new and neerer 
passage to Cataya, than by Capo d’buona Speranza, which 
the Portugalles yeerly use. He began first with himselfe to 
devise, and then with his friendes to conferre, and layde a 
playne platte unto them, that that voyage was not onely 
possible by the north-weast, but also, as he coulde prove, 
easie to bee performed.” 
Elizabeth gave him farewell at Greenwich June 7, 1576, 
whence he sailed with the Gabriel and the Michael, of twenty 
to twenty-five tons each. Frobisher passed along the 
Labrador coast, crossed the entrance of Hudson Strait, and 
coasted along Baffin Land, entering the inlet now known as 
Frobisher’s Bay. He brought back a large stone, “black 
earth,” which it was claimed contained gold, and the queen 
and others subscribed liberally to the founding of the Com- 
pany of Cathay, which was to have a monopoly in all lands 
to the westward where Englishmen had not traded before. 
Expeditions went under Frobisher in 1577 and 1578, but the 
minerals brought back proved to be worthless.

covering of a passage by the north to go to 
Cataia, [Cathay]”’ finally received a charter 
granting for six years a monopoly of discovery 
and colonization in America. In 1578 his 
fleet was twice scattered by storms and the 
attempt abandoned. But in 1583 Gilbert 
sailed to the coast of Newfoundland and took 
possession in the name of the queen. On the 
return voyage his ship, the Squirrel, foun- 
dered in a storm north of the Azores. Gilbert 
and all hands perished.

SIR WALTER RALEIGH, 
ca. 1552-1618 
Port, master of prose, soldier, 
statesman, and patriot, Sir Walter 
Raleigh stands out as a great figure 
in a great age. He was a cru- 
sader for an ideal, whether leading 
his troop of English volunteers in 
the cause of the French Huguenots, 
or expending his resources and his 
strength in American ventures. He 
was the first Englishman to catch 
the vision of America as a place not 
for plunder or primarily for trade, 
but as a new region where English 
homes and English speech and 
English law might flourish. “I 
shall yet live to see it an Inglishe 
nation,” he prophesied. 
A phrase in Raleigh’s charter, 
repeated from that to Sir Humphrey 
Gilbert, granted his colonists “all 
the privileges of free denizens and 
persons native of England in such 
ample manner as if they were born 
and personally resident in our said 
realm of England.” This guarantee, 
renewed in the Virginia charter of 
1606, became one of the bases of the 
struggle for colonial freedom which 
eventually led to independence.    qi

THE DEPARTURE OF RALEIGH’S COLONISTS 
In 1584, Raleigh received a patent and sent two ships to 
America. Following the southern route they finally landed 
at Roanoke Island. In 1585 Raleigh sent out his first 
colony, under Ralph Lane as governor, to the domain 
which he had named “Virginia.” The colonists established 
themselves on Roanoke Island, but there they fared so ill 
that they were glad to sail home next year with Francis 
Drake, who had been raiding the Spanish Main. Just 
after Drake had left, a ship of Raleigh’s “‘freighted with 
all maner of things in most plentiful maner” dropped 
anchor before Roanoke. The relief expedition “after some 
time spent in seeking our Colony up in the Countrey, and 
not finding them, returned with all the aforesayd provision 
into England.” Nothing daunted, Raleigh sent out another 
colony in 1587. 
CHART OF THE COAST OF VIRGINIA, 
1585-86 
Joun Wuire, the artist who accompanied Lane’s colony, 
has outlined in this remarkably faithful map the country 
which was the scene of Raleigh’s ill-fated endeavors. 
Amidas and Barlowe in 1584 had landed at “Wococon” 
(Collington Island), taking possession for the queen under 
Raleigh’s patent. Here Lane’s colony the next year made 
their first landing. Explorations before proceeding to 
“Roanoac” involved the destruction of the Indian village 
of “Aquescgoc” for an alleged theft, an act that made 
enemies of the Indians of the region. From Roanoke 
exploring expeditions had been sent up the river, one of 
which proceeded as far as “ Morataic” in the hope of finding 
a route to China, but was forced to return because of the 
hostility of the natives.         316 From the original drawing by John White in the British Museum, London

Tuus writes Thomas Hariot of the English arrival at Roanoke: ‘Wee came unto a Good bigg yland the 
Inhabitants thereof as soone as they saw us began to make a great and horrible crye. .. . But beenge 
gentlye called backe wee offered them of our wares, as glasses, knives, babies [dolls] and other trifles, which 
wee thought they delighted in . . . then they brought us to their village in the iland called, Roanoac . . . 
such was our arrivall into the parte of the world which we call Virginia.” 
   THE TREE INSCRIBED “CROATOAN” 
TuE second colony to Virginia was led by Governor John White. After building a fort and seeing his colo- 
nists safely housed, White went home for supplies. At this moment, however, the menace of Philip’s Armada 
and the necessary preparations for 
the great struggle on the sea balked 
White’s efforts to return to the relief 
of his colony. Two years passed be- 
fore he was able to sail again for 
Roanoke. Silence greeted his arrival. 
The only sign that Englishmen had 
been there before was the word 
“Croatoan,” the name of a neighbor- 
ing island, carved upon a tree. All 
trace of the colonists had disap- 
peared, and White and his crew were 
left in the uncertainty of surmise as 
to the fate of their fellow-colonists.

SIR FRANCIS DRAKE, ca. 1545-95 
Ons of the ablest contemporaries of Raleigh 
was Francis Drake, the most famous of 
Elizabeth’s seadogs. At ten the red-haired, 
blue-eyed lad was already a sailor. Ten 
years later he commanded one of Hawkins’ 
ships in a disastrous encounter on the Span- 
ish Main. Yet he was destined to harass the 
Spaniards as no other man yet had done. 
Not the least of his adventures was his 
attack upon Nombre de Dios in 1572, and his 
capture of a mule-train of gold and jewels. 
From that day onward Spanish fear and 
hatred of the English scourge ran high. 
DRAKE’S GREATEST ASSAULT 
UPON THE SPANIARDS 
One of the most stirring and_ significant 
episodes in the story of the clash between 
England and Spain was Drake’s voyage 
around the world. His incursions in the 
Caribbean region had caused the Spanish in 
that region to look well to their ports and 
ships. Drake now proposed to attack in an 
unexpected quarter. This old map of the 
world showing the scene of his new operations 
in the Pacific is said to have been corrected 
by Drake himself. The whole region of the 
Caribbean Sea was prepared for defense 
against Drake and the other English free- 
booters. As a result the profits of privateer- 
ing began to fall.   319 From the portrait, probably by Abraham Janssen, 1594, in Buckland ' Abbey, Yelverton, Devonshire, England

    THE GOLDEN HIND 
On December 13, 1577, Drake slipped 
quietly out of English waters with his little 
fleet of five vessels. The Golden Hind, his 
flagship, was of only 100 tons. The ships 
were abundantly stocked with ammunition 
and carried 350 men, among whom were 
some gentlemen adventurers out for a lark. 
The fleet turned south along the African 
coast picking up some Portuguese and 
Spanish vessels. Then Drake turned his 
prows across the southern Atlantic. He was 
following, in a general way, the route of the 
great Magellan. Englishmen who had 
helped to finance the enterprise awaited 
expectantly the return of the fleet laden 
with rich booty. Weeks passed as the little 
flotilla sailed through the steady trades, 
crossed the equatorial belt of calms, and 
ran down the south Atlantic with the conti- 
nent of South America on the starboard 
side. On board the ships, musicians, whom 
Drake, with much foresight, had brought 
along, broke up the monotony of the long 
ocean voyage. ENGLAND’S CHALLENGE TO SPAIN

TREASURE SHIP 
Reacuinc the Strait of Magellan, Drake 
essayed the hazardous channel. Only one 
of his ships, the Golden Hind, got through. 
In this sea-worn flagship he sailed into 
the Pacific and northward along the 
Spanish coast of South America. Drake 
made several rich hauls. He pursued the 
pride of the Spanish treasure fleet, Nuestra 
Senora de la Concepcién, “the chiefest glory 
of the whole South Sea,” carrying a rich 
cargo of gold, jewels, and silver. Don 
Anton, her captain, seeing the unexpected 
sail on the horizon and never dreaming 
that any other than a Spanish ship had 
entered the Pacific, slackened speed and 
ordered up wine for his visitor. Drake, 
however, came not as guest but as master. 
“Accept with patience the usage of war,” 
said the new-comer as he took possession. 
The western coast was thrown into con- 
sternation.

As a result of Drake’s disquieting captures, the whole Spanish coast was now on the alert for the red-bearded 
marauder. Now, if ever, thought Drake, should the long-sought Strait of Anian prove a short and safe 
route home. Accordingly he sailed northward looking for it, as 
far as British Columbia. Then turning back, he anchored in 
Dreke’s Bay north of San Francisco and took possession of this 
new land for his sovereign, naming it New Albion. Thence he 
steered westward for the East Indies, rounded the Cape of 
Good Hope and by more familiar waters came at length home, 
having made the “encompassment of all the worlde.” 
ELIZABETH KNIGHTS DRAKE 
Own the Golden Hind, lying off London, Drake gave a banquet 
to the queen “finer than has ever been seen in England since Henry 
VIII.” Elizabeth came wearing her crown, the most gorgeous 
of her gowns, and in her merriest mood, for she knew that Philip 
was gnashing his teeth over his losses. She lifted a gilded sword 
and bade Drake kneel. ‘He [Philip] hath demanded Drake’s 
head of me,” she said gaily, “and here I have a gilded sword 
to strike it off.” Then, after the customary tap of the sword on 
the kneeling man’s shoulder, she pronounced the formula, “TI 
bid thee rise, Sir Francis Drake.” And an English poet wrote:

ENGLAND’S CHALLENGE TO SPAIN 165 
THOMAS CAVENDISH, ca. 1555-92, 
SAILS AROUND THE WORLD 
To live at court as he would — that is, to shine 
there — Thomas Cavendish, gentleman, needed 
more money than he possessed. In search of 
fortune, he set out for the Spanish Main in 1585, 
and thence started to circumnavigate the globe, 
the third man to attempt the feat. In the Pa- 
cific he made a rich haul and captured the Santa 
Ana, the pride of the new Spanish treasure fleet. 
He made Plymouth in 1588, and, according 
to an old story, with his sailors dressed in silks, 
his sails of damask, and his topmast covered 
with cloth of gold. The sight of Spanish treasure 
was hailed with rejoicing and drew fresh adven- 
turous spirits into the queen’s navy. 
Three years later Cavendish was again in 
straits. He organized a second expedition into 
the Atlantic and Pacific. But this time fortune 
was unkind. The enterprise was an utter failure, 
due, in part, to Cavendish himself. On his way 
home, in 1592, declaring falsely with his last 
breath that his partner, John Davis, had de- 
serted him, Cavendish died, and was buried at sea. 
His: only important contribution to knowledge as 
a result of his two great expeditions was the dis- 
covery of “ Port Desire” on the coast of Patagonia. 395 Rromiltisnvy (Eronawa ee ereedtogta Aagtan, 1690 
  CHARLES HOWARD, 1536-1624, LORD 
EFFINGHAM: LORD HIGH ADMIRAL 
Cuartes Howarp, Lord Effingham, was the titular 
head of the fleet, of which Drake was the brains. 
English raids upon the Spanish colonies and treasure- 
ships had become unendurable. It was clear that in 
his good time Philip would attempt to clean out the 
nest of pirates and heretics, and Howard is said to 
have remarked to the queen: 
“For the love of Jesus Christ, Madame, awake 
thoroughly and see the villainous treasons round 
about you, against your Majesty and your realm, 
and draw your forces round about you like a mighty 
prince to defend you. Truly, Madame, if you do so, 
there is no cause for fear. Put down whatever of 
treason lies at home and prepare for foreign war.” 
If this quotation is correct, the advice was 
good. Spain was steadily and rapidly growing in 
power and ambition. The same was true of Eng- 
land. The rival interests of the two powers made 
for an inevitable clash on the Atlantic. England 
sought to trade with all the world; Spain excluded 
all foreigners from her oversea possessions and for 
the trade between Old and New Spain made the

In 1585 the trouble 
brewing between Eng- 
land and Spain broke in- 
to open hostilities. In 
that year Drake set off 
for the Spanish Main, 
not for plunder but for 
war. Late in the au-

Santo Domingo. The

Domingo, Drake went over to Cartagena, took the town from the Spaniards, and 
held it for a heavy ransom. Then he made for St. Augustine. There was no rich loot to be taken here, but 
Spanish Florida was a menace to Virginia; so Drake set St. Augustine afire and destroyed it. Then sailing 
north to Roanoke, he took Raleigh’s first colony aboard and turned homewards.

THE ARMADA IN SIGHT 
In 1580 Philip had conquered Portugal and had joined her fine fleet to his own. Eight years later he was 
ready to send his Armada against England. But Elizabeth’s navy was prepared. On Friday, July 19, 
1588, runs an old story, Drake and Howard were playing a game of bowls on Plymouth Hoe, when up rushed 
the Captain of the Golden Hind with news that the Spanish Armada was in sight. Noticing the terror of the 
crowd of townsfolk and realizing that his first duty was to quiet it, Drake, after whispering an order, called 
out “There’s time to end our game and beat the Spanish, too.”    
    
             
   TAPESTRY PICTURES OF THE GREAT BATTLE 
Tue next morning Drake, with a fleet of fifty-four vessels, sighted, through a thickening mist and 
drizzling rain, the Armada near the Eddystone. But. instead of risking an engagement, he allowed the 
Armada, consisting of one hundred and twenty-eight ships, to advance up the Channel in the famous 
eagle formation, and then attacked it from the rear, with the advantage of a favorable wind. John Pine 
of London, who in 
1739 engraved the Ar- 
mada pictures, says 
in his “Account ” that 
the engagements be- 
tween the two fleets 
were “represented in 
ten curious Pieces of 
Tapestry, with the Por- 
traits of the several 
English Captains,

some in the Royal 
Wardrobe, some in the

       ENGLAND’S CHALLENGE TO SPAIN 
  
  THE SPANISH ADMIRAL SURRENDERS TO DRAKE 
One of the dramatic incidents in this great final battle between England and Spain for mastery of the seas 
was the personal encounter of Drake with the Spanish Admiral, Don Pedro de Valdes. When the command 
to surrender came from the Revenge, Don Pedro’s galleon was about to sink, but the brave Spaniard refused. 
Then, learning that it was Drake in person who challenged him, he surrendered. Don Pedro tendered him 
his sword, saying that it was an honor to yield it to the greatest seaman in the world. 
THE BURIAL OF SIR FRANCIS DRAKE 
In August, 1595, Drake led another fleet out to harry Spain’s American possessions. In the Mosquito Gulf, 
fever attacked the men, and Drake himself was stricken. On his orders to ‘“‘take the wind as God had sent 
it,” the ships moved to the harbor of Puerto Bello, twenty miles from Nombre de Dios. Here in January, 
zi 1595, Drake came to 
his end. “Amid the 
thunder of the guns 
whose voice he knew so 
well, and surrounded by 
consuming pyres afloat 
and on the shore, his 
body was committed to 
the deep, while muffled 
drums rolled out their 
last salute and trumpets 
wailed his requiem.” 
His men then burned 
Puerto Bello, the Span- 
ish ships they had taken. 
and two of their own 
vessels, for the ravages 
of fever had not left 
them sailors enough to 
man the ships.

ROUTES OF THE ELIZABETHAN SEA ROVERS 
Tue trails of the English seamen of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries lay thick upon the Atlantic 
with two across the vast Pacific. They tell the tale of the activity and the daring of the sea rovers of England 
in a way that nothing else can do. The English were both privateers and explorers. They challenged Spain’s 
claim to the exclusive possession of the new lands which Columbus had first brought to the knowledge of the 
world. They opposed the commercial provisions which Spain established to govern the trade between the 
home country and the over-sea colonies. One commercial fleet a year should go from Seville to Vera Cruz 
and one to Nombre de Dios. No Spaniard might trade with the continent save through these fleets. No 
foreigner should trade at all with Spanish America. But. the British of Elizabethan England would not sit 
quietly by and watch Spain wax in wealth and power by means of the treasure from the New World. Nor 
were they content to accept the continent of North America as a barrier between England and India and 
China. Diligently they sought a passage through or around it on the north. These were the men who helped 
to bring down the sea-power of Spain and who gained for England a foothold on the North American conti- 
nent. Their achievement is one of the greatest in the English annals of the sea.

CHAPTER IX 
“AND OURS TO HOLD VIRGINIA” 
N 1603 Elizabeth died and the powerful Tudors gave place to the House of Stuart. 
England had prospered under her “good Queen Bess.” The interests and thoughts 
of her people had reached out to distant parts of the world. Raleigh’s scheme of 
settlement had come to naught, but the fall of Spanish sea-power had removed the chief 
menace to the English on the sea lanes that led to the New World. New companies of 
merchants and investors had carried English trade into Russia, the Levant and India. 
Three years after James came to the throne two more companies, the London and the 
Plymouth Companies, were formed for colonization and trade in North America. Both 
almost at once turned their energies to procuring colonists for their great undertakings. 
In three months the Plymouth Company had things in readiness, and in August, 1606, 
sent out a trial ship followed two months later by another. But the first was captured by 
the Spaniards, and the second, after skirting the American coast, sailed home without 
making a settlement. The tidings brought back, however, stimulated the Company to 
a greater effort, and in August, 1607, two ships dropped anchor at the mouth of the 
Sagadahoc, or Kennebec river on the Maine coast. After a sermon by the preacher, 
the reading of the instructions from the Company in England revealed George Popham 
president of the colony. A fort was built and fortified with twelve pieces of ordnance. 
Inside, a church, a storehouse and fifteen cabins were erected. A shipbuilder constructed 
a pinnace which was afterward used in Virginia. 
But many of the colonists became discouraged, and half went back to England 
when the ships returned in December. The winter was a time of suffering and terror 
for the little handful of men on the frozen Kennebec. Their storehouse burned and with 
it most of their provisions. Their leader, Popham, died. In the spring, when a ship 
came again from England, with one accord the colonists resolved to return. ‘‘And 
this,” in the words of the chronicler, Strachey, “was the end of that northerne colony 
upon the river Sagadahoc.” Meanwhile, to the southward on the James had been 
established the first permanent English settlement in America.

THE LONDON CUSTOMS HOUSE 
Durinc the great days of Elizabeth and especially after the fall of Spanish sea-power, commerce, that new 
handmaid of British agriculture, spread apace. East, south, and west, farther and farther from the Thames 
went the adventurous traders of England. The old customs house in London received the cargoes of a 
swiftly growing merchant fleet. England was taking a new place in the world.

  - MERCHANTS ADVENTURERS eal MUSCOVY COMPANY 
THE FIRST TRADING COMPANIES 
BritisH capital was meagre, and the hazards of trading in distant, often half-civilized, regions were great. 
Merchants therefore pooled their resources and distributed the risks. They organized companies incor- 
porated by the Crown. Each company had a monopoly of the trade of the particular part of the world 
assigned to it. There was the company known as the Merchants of the Staple, incorporated by Edward III, 
and trading in wool across the Channel. The Merchants Adventurers were incorporated by Elizabeth to 
trade also across the Channel. The Muscovy Company traded with the dark interior of Russia. The Levant 
Company held the monopoly of the Near East. Greatest of all was the East India Company which, by its 
charter, received sole rights to trade with all nations east of the Cape of Good Hope to the Strait of Magellan. 
These are but a few of the many merchant enterprises, among which the London and Plymouth Companies 
were organized to colonize and trade in Virginia, and which were destined to play so prominent a part in the 
establishment of English power on the North American continent.

Tue escutcheon is quartered with the arms of England and 
France, Scotland and Ireland, crested by a maiden queen 
with flowing hair and crown. The motto means “Behold 
Virginia gives a fifth’ [Kingdom]. After the union of 
England and Scotland, “fifth”? was changed to “fourth.” 
With a slight alteration, the coat was used by Virginia 
until the Revolution, the arms of the Georges being presently 
substituted for those of the Stuarts. The London Company 
(1606) was enlarged in 1609 under the name of the Virginia 
Company, and its great colonizing venture was backed by 
all England. Its stockholders included bishops, lords, may- 
ors, knights, merchants, and the workers’ guilds. 
In 1606, when the company was first founded, another 
company, the Plymouth Company, also received a charter. 
Each company was to have land for fifty miles north and 
south of its first settlement, a hundred miles out to sea and 
a hundred miles inland. Neither was to settle within a 
hundred miles of the other. The companies were to have 
the right to mine gold, silver and copper; the king was to 
receive a fifth of the precious metals, but only a fifteenth 
of copper. So the Spanish fortune in the south influenced 
the ideas of the English. The charters followed another 
Spanish precedent in providing that Christianity should 
be taught to the natives.

Amone the influential commercial 
backers of England’s great enterprises was 
Sir Thomas Smythe. He was the first gover- 
nor of the East India Company and long 
directed its affairs. He was also a governor 
of the Muscovy Company, and was interested 
in the Levant Company and other similar 
enterprises. Such was the commercial train- 
ing of the man who became the first treasurer 
of the London Company and the director 
of the Virginia enterprise during its most 
critical years. In August, 1606, an advance 
agent was sent to Virginia to choose a site 
for the settlement, but he was captured by 
the Spaniards. In the last days of 1606, the 
company sent out three ships, the Sarah 
Constant, the Goodspeed and the Discovery, 
to establish a colony in the New World.

War with Spain did not 
come to an end until 1604, 
after James I had begun 
his reign. Perhaps the un- 
certainties which were an 
inevitable part of the con- 
flict had retarded the 
establishment of English 
settlements. Perhaps 
Raleigh’s conspicuous fail- 
ure had kept English 
companies from further 
venturing in the Virginia 
wilderness. Whatever the 
causes, almost three years 
passed after the conclusion 
of peace before the little 
flotilla of the London 
Company set sail. The 
undertaking was a private 
enterprise. James’ government looked on with interest and 
favor but did not participate. Gentlemen and laborers, on the 
whole representative Englishmen, were sent out to America.

  THE BUILDING OF JAMESTOWN — 1607 
“THE six and twentieth day of April, about foure a clocke in the morning, wee descried the Land of Virginia,”

THE TRIAL OF JOHN SMITH 
Tue London Company had no more comprehension of the realities of American life than did the settlers. 
An ineffective system of government was established with the result that, on the voyage over, before it had 
been set up, quarrels on ship-board had resulted in making John Smith a prisoner. After the landing a trial 
straightened the matter out but did not alter the ineffectiveness of the arrangement. The control of affairs 
in Virginia was put in the hands of a Council 
of which Edwin Maria Wingfield was president 
and Smith a member. 
SMITH’S A TRUE RELATION 
LackinG a strong controlling hand the colo- 
nists soon fell into confusion, which was increased 
by the tasks laid upon them by the Company, 
whose main motive was profit. The colonists 
were to search for gold and for a possible route 
to the Pacific. Valuable time and energy were 
expended in largely fruitless wanderings among 
the Virginian woods and rivers. The one gain 
from these was the establishing of contact with 
the Indians and the beginning of trade. 
But at Jamestown little real progress was 
made in putting the settlement on a solid 
foundation. The colonists were servants of the 
Company. Whatever profit they made went to 
the Company. That powerful incentive, op- 
portunity for private gain, was conspicuously 
absent. Inevitably, the colonists were disinclined 
to work. When disease and death weakened 
the Council, the confusion became complete. 
The food began to run low. The coming of new 
supplies was uncertain. The fact was brought 
home to every man that the colony faced de- 
struction. Under such circumstances a natural 
leader, John Smith, arose for a few months.

“AND OURS TO HOLD 
CAPTAYNE JOHN SMITH 
Smrru finally became President of the Council and proved an 
energetic and able leader. He explored, traded busily, and 
set the colonists to raising crops. In a few adventurous 
months he won for himself lasting renown and also the 
reputation for telling somewhat exaggerated tales. But 
neither Smith nor any one else in Virginia was capable of 
saving the colony. Its fate rested with the Company, 
which was responsible for its government and support. 
And the Company strove to rise to the situation. Sup- 
plies and colonists were sent out at great expense. But 
good tidings did not come from Virginia to the London 
office — only news that the colonists became sick, used up 
the supplies, and were still unable to support themselves, 
let alone make a profit for the Company. Virginia was an 
experiment in colonization made peculiarly difficult because 
the natural environment was so different from any with 
which Englishmen were familiar. The Company slowly 
learned by costly experience and, in the face of the most 
discouraging conditions, refused to abandon its enterprise.

THE FIRST WOMEN ARRIVE IN     JAMESTOWN 
In the second year of the colony there arrived 
in Christopher Newport’s ship seventy 
colonists including Master Thomas Forest, 
a gentleman who brought his wife with him 
and a maid, Anne Burras, to wait upon her. 
By winter Madam Forest had lost her maid 
to John Laydon, laborer, at the first wedding 
in Virginia. These two brave women came 
to the banks of the James not long before the 
colony almost crumbled to ruin. Two years 
later Sir Thomas Gates described the plight 
of the settlement. ‘‘Cast up this reckoning 
together: want of government, store of 
idlenesse, their expectations frustrated by 
traitors, their market spoyled by the Mariners, 
our nets broken, the deere chased, our boats 
lost, our hogs killed, our trade with the 
Indians forbidden, some of our men fled, 
some murthered, and most by drinking of 
the brackish water of James fort weakened, 
and endaungered, famine and sicknesse by 
all these means increased. . . . Above all, 
having neither Ruler, nor Preacher, they 
neither feared God nor man, which provoked 
the wrath of the Lord of Hosts, and pulled 
downe his judgements upon them.”

Already starvation had nearly destroyed the struggling

“AND OURS TO HOLD VIRGINIA” 
THE FIRST FOOTING IN 
BERMUDA 
Sir Tuomas Gates, commissioned as Gov- 
ernor of Virginia, Sir George Somers, and 
Christopher Newport were all on board the 
Sea Adventure in the fleet that went out to 
Virginia in 1609. A storm in mid-ocean 
separated the Sea Adventure from the other 
ships, and drove her on the Bermuda Islands, 
the leaking ship a useless wreck. Ten 
months the Virginia colonists lived among 
the Bermudas. They built huts. A dog 
had come ashore with them. 
A thousand hogges that dogge did kill 
Their hunger to sustaine. 
From the wrecked ship, fast on a reef but 
half a mile from land, they brought stores 
of many kinds. As the weeks passed and 
no kindly sail appeared to take them off, 
they built pinnaces, the “brave Deliverance” 
and the Patience. So they came to Virginia. 
The chance landing on the Bermudas 
called into being a new English colony. 
In 1612 the Virginia Company was given 
jurisdiction over the islands, but two years 
later they were allotted to a specially in- 
corporated Somers Island Company. In 
the latter year some six hundred persons 
were living in the islands, a number which 
grew to between two and three thousand 
in the next ten years.

The prosperity of Bermuda, like that of Virginia, rested on tobacco. 
GEORGE PERCY, 1586-1632 
SEvEN vessels of the fleet of nine from which the Sea Adven- 
ture had been separated arrived at Jamestown without 
the governor or the admiral, with well-nigh three hundred 
persons to add to the hundred there. Smith was still 
president but, as the winter of 1609-10 drew on, trouble 
was heaped on trouble. The terrible starving time began 
in which four hundred Virginians were reduced to sixty. 
Before this disaster occurred, Smith, wounded in an acci- 
dent, had been deposed and sent to England. Perey, who 
succeeded him, now lay ill and unable to keep order. In 
the spring, Gates and Somers arrived from Bermuda in 
pinnaces which they had built. They found the colony 
on the brink of disaster. There was dissension among 
the officers who remained alive. The Indians, sensing 
the weakness of the whites, were beginning to attack the 
settlement. Disease and starvation had laid the colony 
prostrate. Gates and Somers took charge of the hopeless 
situation. They decided to wind up the affairs of Jamestown. 
They loaded the survivors aboard their little pinnaces and 
dropped down the river, prepared to hazard the voyage 
across the Atlantic.

THOMAS WEST, THIRD LORD DELAWARE 
Ar the mouth of the James the departing Virginians 
met Lord De La Warr with new colonists and fresh 
supplies. With this new energy Jamestown was rebuilt, 
and exploration was pushed forward under Captain 
Argall. The new governor fell ill and soon went home, 
and in March, 1611, Sir Thomas Dale was sent out as 
Marshal of Virginia. The coming of Dale and the firm 
establishment of Virginia destroyed a fondly cherished 
Spanish hope. Far-seeing Spaniards prophesied that, 
if Virginia lived, it would become the base for hostile 
operations against Spanish commerce —a prophecy 
which time was to fulfill. 
ARGALL AMONG THE CHICKAHOMINIES 
Captain SamuEL ArGALL became a prominent figure in 
Virginia in Dale’s time. In 1609 he had discovered the 
short transatlantic route via the Canaries, and a little 
later he brought over more colonists. He dashed north 
and burned the French settlements at Mount Desert 
and Acadia. He went up the rivers of Virginia and 
either cajoled or threatened the Indians into good be- 
havior. Here he is shown powwowing with the Chicka- 
hominies.

  SPANISH SCOUTS AT ALGERNOUNE FORT, 1611 
Tuer Spanish ambassador at London, Zufiiga, kept his govern- 
ment informed of the planting of Virginia, but the Spanish 
authorities underestimated its significagce and thought that 
England was wasting money on a worthless territory. 
Two expeditions were despatched, one in 1609 and the 
second in 1611, to spy out the land and obtain information. 
The first went to Virginia, but finding a ship anchored in the 
bay and fearing a trap, withdrew without attempting to 
reconnoiter. The other, entering the bay, sent a boat ashore 
with three men, Molina, Pérez, and Francis Lymbry, who 
were seized and held in captivity by the English there. 
THE “TRON GOVERNOR’S” LETTER, 1611 
Tue “Iron Governor” is a favorite sobriquet for Sir Thomas 
Dale, who took the reins of power in Virginia when De La 
Warr went home. The colony was disorganized by disease 
and lawlessness. Dale introduced order and discipline. 
This letter, his first, to the President and Council of 
Virginia in England, is dated May 25, 1611. In it he notes 
certain things to be done at Jamestown: the repairing of 
the falling church and storehouse, the building of a stable 
and a powder house, “‘a new well for the amending of the 
most unholsome water,” and “a block house on the north 
side of our back river to prevent Indians from killing our 
cattle,” a winter shelter for cattle, a forge, a bridge to be 
constructed, a private garden for each man, and common 
gardens for hemp, flax, and other necessities.   fos lepil ee e FL. hig egy

THE NEW COLONY UNDER DALE 
Date instituted a code of “‘lawes and orders dyvyne, 
politique, and martial,” for the regeneration of young 
Virginia. Barbarous punishments were the rule in the 
seventeenth century; but Dale’s colonial laws outdid in 
severity English laws of the period. His statutes were 
“cheifely extracted out of the laws for governing the 
armye in the Low Countreys.”” 
William Strachey compiled the first part of the code; 
presumably the latter part is the work of Dale, Sir Thomas 
Gates and Sir Edward Cecil, all of whom had served in the 
Low Countries. Iron discipline was needed, if this isolated 
outpost of England were ever to survive, let alone produce 
a profit for the investors who had risked their money in 
the London Company. Self-interest was added to disci- of Virginea: 
pline as a driving force when Dale allowed the colonists, 
most of whom were really employees of the Company, to D E CL A R I N G TH E

THE CAPTURE OF 
POCAHONTAS, 1613 
Dat felt that the colony’s des- 
perate situation called for dras- 
tic action. Some of the men, 
chafing under the new régime, 
ran away from the colony. They 
were apprehended and, when 
brought back, some were burned 
at the stake. Dale also set out 
to force the Indians about the 
James to respect the whites. 
Powhatan’s appetite for war 
speedily diminished. Captain 
Argall who for a time co-operated 
with Governor Dale, conceived 
it a brilliant stroke of policy to 
capture Powhatan’s daug'iter, 
Pocahontas, and hold her as a 
hostage. For the bribe of a 
copper kettle, one of her kins- 
men took her aboard Argall’s 
ship, and Argall, thereupon, 
carried her off to Jamestown.     From Theodore de Bry, Voyages, Part X, 1619 183 
   
DALE AND RALPH HAMOR VISIT POWHATAN AFTER THE CAPTURE OF POCAHONTAS

tobacco led to the establishment of that crop as the economic foundation of Virginia. With the advent of 
364 From Theodore de Bry, Voyages,      tobacco the future 
of the colony was 
assured. Rolfe also 
fell in love with Poca-

capture, he, with Dale 
and Ralph Hamor, 
secretary of the col- 
ony, went to demand 
friendship and peace 
of Powhatan. After 
the conference Hamor 
wrote: “And _ ever 
since we have had 
friendly commerce 
and trade, not onely 
with Powhatan him- 
selfe, but also with his 
subjects round about 
us; so as now I see 
no reason why the 
Collonie should not

POCAHONTAS — A POPULAR AMERICAN HEROINE 
Tue Spaniards in New Spain freely intermarried with the Indians and such unions were not uncommon 
among the French fur traders along the St. Lawrence river. The English, of all the nationalities that came 
in large numbers to North America, were the most conscious of race. Intermarriage with the red Ss 
very uncommon. Yet, from the beginning, romance has surrounded the figure of the Indian princess who 
married one of the chief men of Virginia. She was the center of interest when Rolfe took her to England 
and her portrait was painted. Nineteenth-century Americans sentimentalized and idealized this forest 
heroine in literature, the drama and various imaginative portraits and pictures of her baptism and marriage.

THE MARRIAGE OF POCAHONTAS 
Tur bar of her heathen religion removed by her baptism, John Rolfe and Pocahontas were made one. Their 
joy was brief. After two years Rolfe took his wife and infant son to England, where the Indian “prin- 
cess” caused a great stir. At Gravesend just before 
they were to sail for America Pocahontas died of 
smallpox. 
In the parish register at Gravesend stands the 
entry: “1616 May 2j Rebecca Wrothe, wyff of 
Thomas Wroth gent, a Virginia lady borne, here 
was buried in ye chauncell.” 
SIR EDWIN SANDYS 
Tur year 1618 was a momentous one in the history 
of the Virginia Company. Sir Edwin Sandys became 
its treasurer and new life was put into the manage- 
ment of the Virginia enterprise. The next year 
a liberal-minded governor was sent out to Jamestown 
to carry on the administration where Dale had left 
off. But even under the management of Sandys, one 
of the great financial figures of his day, the affairs of 
the Virginia Company did not prosper. 
By 1624, reports of mismanagement in the Vir- 
ginia Company had become so persistent that James 
I, further aroused by the liberalism of some of the 
members, revoked the charter and Virginia automat-

ASSEMBLY OF VIRGINIA 
On July 30, 1619, the first assembly of repre- 
sentatives in Virginia met in the Jamestown 
church. Governor George Yeardley and 
the Council chosen by the Virginia Company 
sat inthe chancel. In the body of the church 
sat the representatives or burgesses., The 
session opened with prayer, followed by 
earnest deliberation upon the all-impor- 
tant questions of defense, Indian relations, 
agriculture, and religion. The twenty-two 
burgesses, sitting hat on head, represented 
James City, Charles City, the City of Hen- 
ricus, Kecoughtan, Smythe’s Hundred, 
Flowerdieu Hundred, Martin’s Hundred, 
Martin’s Brandon, Ward’s Plantation, 
Lawne’s Plantation, and Argall’s Gift. The 
English population of Virginia at this date 
numbered about one thousand souls. 
MAP OF EARLY VIRGINIA 
Virernta had grown since the terrible days 
of the starving time. Little settlements had 
sprung up along both banks of the James. 
Near neighbors to the English were the Vir- 
ginia Indians who in 1622 swept down upon 
the whites in a terrible massacre. It was a 
heavy blow but so firmly was the colony 
established that new habitations quickly 
rose on the ashes of the old and a host of 
new-comers made good the loss of those who 
had been killed.

VIRGINIA AND HER NEIGHBORS 
Tue early London Company had insistently enjoined upon its early colonists the double task of finding 
gold and searching out a route to the South Sea, as the Pacific was then called. Popular ignorance of America 
was still such in 1651 as to permit of the publication of this quaint map showing the China Sea “ten dayes 
march” beyond the Blue Ridge. The long-sought-for passage through the continent appears, save for a 
small obstruction, in the guise of the Hudson River. 
Years of adventure and hardship were to pass before the true outlines of America would be sketched in. 
Yet this old map with all its curious geography shows the development that had come about on the American 
continent since the first ships dropped anchor at Jamestown. The land of Carolina lies to the south of 
Virginia to whose rich lands Virginians are turning their attention. 
North of the Potomac (Maryland River) were 
Baltimore’s Catholic settlements. Beyond were 
the Swedes of the Delaware River, the Dutch in 
the Hudson valley and, further north, New Eng- 
land and New France. 
WESTWARD HO!— SHIPS TO VIRGINIA 
THE common ignorance of Virginia in England 
was great, but there was enough knowledge of 
the land to entice emigrants thither. While, in 
1622, there were roughly twelve hundred settlers, 
by 1650 the number had increased to more than 
fifteen thousand souls. From then on the growth 
was steady and rapid. The initial hazards of 
settlement were over, and each year the path : - 
across the sea became more familiar. on Dalntng, by Carton 7. Chapman aailleaiacss

THE INDIAN MASSACRE OF 
1622 
In 1622 occurred a general Indian massacre 
which came close to destroying the colony. 
For a number of years the English settlers 
had known peace with their neighbors, 
and even the rumors of hostility which had 
been current on the death of Powhatan in 
1618 had been killed by the new chief’s 
assurance that friendly relations would 
continue. Then suddenly and without 
warning the Indians rose, attacked the 
villages and outlying plantations, and 
killed more than three hundred settlers. 
The work of years was destroyed in a few 
hours. Jamestown escaped the massacre 
through the timely warning of a friendly 
Indian.

    1. #7} PICTURES IN THE GENERALL HISTORIE 
® Smirn’s artist added a fanciful sketch (No. 382) to 
fa depict an episode which Smith narrated. The cap- 
tain told of an exploring trip up the James in the infant 
days of the colony when he had fallen into the power of the Indians, and had finally been brought 
before the great chief, Powhatan. Condemned to death, his head was resting on a stone when Pocahontas, 
the little daughter of the chieftain, begged that his life be spared. The artist seems to have used his imagina- 
tion freely as, in all probability, Smith did. 
Among the three pictures below, White’s drawing (No. 383) was apparently made for the purpose of 
showing costume and tattooing. In de Bry (No. 385) the artist has copied White’s figure reversed and then 
has added a fanciful sketch of a deer hunt. Smith’s artist (No. 384) has evidently copied de Bry rather than 
White. The background has changed from a deer hunt to a battle between whites and Indians, the latter 
fighting in close order formation after the manner of European soldiers. \ ae > a

RUIN OF THE JAMESTOWN CHURCH, BUILT BETWEEN 1676 AND 1684 
America as well as Europe has its historic ruins. This was the third church built in Jamestown, now the 
only relic of the original settlement. The first church was hardly a building; logs did for seats, a stump 
with a board topping it served as a reading desk, and sail-cloth roofed it. The second, built of logs with 
tower and look-out, was the highest building in the colony. There the first shipment of maids married 
Virginia planters, and there met the first House of Burgesses. The building was destroyed when Nathaniel 
Bacon flung a torch into Jamestown in 1676.

CHAPTER X 
PILGRIMS AND PURITANS IN NEW ENGLAND 
Plymouth Company was chartered with rights to the north of its contemporary 
holdings. It at once made the unsuccessful attempt to found a colony at the mouth 
of the Kennebec river in New England. The company did not abandon its interest in 
the New World. In 1614 Captain John Smith explored and mapped the New England 
coast and two years later the Plymouth Company made him Admiral of New England. 
But Smith’s attempt to found a settlement also failed. Meanwhile, Sir Ferdinando 
Gorges, a prominent member of the Plymouth Company, sent fishing and trading 
voyages into the company’s domain. Gorges retained an interest in America when 
many of his fellow members in the Plymouth enterprise lost heart at the failure of their 
company to establish a colony. On November 13, 1620, a new organization, the Council 
of New England, fathered by Gorges, was incorporated to take the place of the older 
company. In the autumn of the following year the Council sent out to America by the 
ship Fortune a patent for a little body of Separatists that had the year before settled 
without legal right at Plymouth in New England. 
But the Council of New England proved to be not without rivals. It was but eight 
years old when an association of men in Lincolnshire and London procured, through the 
assistance of the Earl of Warwick, a patent to lands in the very heart of the domain 
already granted to the Council of New England. In the same year, 1628, John Endicott 
led about fifty settlers to Massachusetts. The Gorges interest fought the new enterprise 
but failed. In 1629 a royal charter confirmed the grant to Endicott and his followers 
and established a new corporation known as the “Governor and Company of Massachu- 
setts Bay in New England.” The Massachusetts Bay Company was a trading company 
of the same general type as the old London Company, but it met with quite a different 
fate. Within a year of its founding English Puritans, anxious to escape the growing 
opposition of Charles I to their movement, bought up the Massachusetts Bay Company, 
took the charter across the sea and established the headquarters of the company in the 
New World. Thus the charter of a commercial company became the frame of govern- 
ment for a colony organized as a refuge for a persecuted sect. The Puritans were a group 
within the Church of England who wished to modify the church service and who stood 
for a more strict moral code. They were also a political party fighting for the rights of 
Parliament as opposed to those of the sovereign. They became numerous enough to 
win the great Civil War. 
There was also in England in the early years of the seventeenth century a very small 
and inconspicuous group of religious radicals who, unlike the Puritans, believed that the 
reformers should come out of the Church of England and also that Church and State 
should be separated. These people were known as Brownists or Separatists. One small 
band of this sect won fame because of its part in the founding of America. LT: the same year of 1606 in which the London Company had been founded, the

of the post station where the 
postman changed horses. Brew-

Elizabeth’s secretary, Davison, 
and had accompanied him on 
diplomatic missions abroad. At

Over the meadows and the grassy

Nottingham the boy used to 
tramp three miles on a Sunday 
to worship with the congregation 
at Scrooby, which like the other 
Separatists had broken from the 
established church.

  THE PILGRIMS IN HOLLAND 
In 1608 a number of these Separatists, dissatisfied with conditions in England, removed to Holland. They 
were led by their beloved pastor, John Robinson, who had conducted their meetings at Scrooby. “‘The most 
learned, polished, and modest spirit that ever that sect enjoyed,” was the comment on him by one of his 
vigorous opponents. Robinson went with the group to Leyden. He had hoped to follow the Pilgrims who 
sailed to America in 1620. Death overtook him in 1625. 
  
  
VIEW OF LEYDEN, 
17TH CENTURY 
Tux Pilgrims had been, chiefly, 
countrymen. But Leyden was a 
city, and the new life forced them 
to learn “trades and traffics.” 
Many became weavers, some 
day-laborers. William Bradford 
was a silk weaver. William 
Brewster, whose lovable charac- 
ter as Plymouth’s religious leader 
is so well depicted by Bradford, 
was a printer. But in danger of 
being engulfed by the Dutch life 
about them and fearing to lose 
their mother tongue and educate 
their children in Holland, the con- 
gregation elected to leave Europe 
for America, where they could 
enjoy religious freedom and use 
their own speech.       393 From Carolus Allard, Orbis Habitabilis, ca. 1690

THE DOCK AT 
DELFTHAVEN 
From Delfthaven the little band of 
adventurers sailed in the Speedwell 
for Southampton where the May- 
flower awaited them. They had 
entered into a financial agreement 
with some seventy London mer- 
chants organized as a voluntary 
(unincorporated). joint-stock com- 
pany. The merchants furnished 
capital; the Pilgrims contributed 
service. For seven years, while the 
arrangement was to last, no lands or 
goods should be divided, in order 
that the investors might receive a 
profit. The arrangement proved 
unsatisfactory; the colonists bought 
out the interest of the merchants and saddled their settlement with a heavy mortgage.

EMBARKATION FROM DELFTHAVEN 
Tue Pilgrim venture, unlike most of the enterprises for settling in America, was dominantly religious and the 
Pilgrims were a sincere and devout people. Most of them lacked education and social position, and were 
poor in purse, but all were inspired with a great vision. There was rare courage in the little group that knelt 
on the dock in prayer as they prepared to strike out upon a great adventure. There was but one English 
settlement in the New World and that but thirteen years old. To Virginia they intended to go, but weariness 
of the long voyage and the lateness of the year led them to turn in at Cape Cod.

MODEL OF THE 
MAYFLOWER 
Tue Pilgrims set out from 
Southampton in August, 1620, 
in the Mayflower and the 
Speedwell. The Mayflower was 
of about 180 tons burden. The 
Speedwell proved unseaworthy 
and the two ships put in at 
Dartmouth for repairs. They 
started again, but again the

Plymouth, the passengers, ex- 
cept twenty left on shore, crowded into the Mayflower, 102 souls all 
told. For sixty-five days the little ship was buffeted by the Atlantic. 
But, said the steadfast Pilgrims, “it is not with us as with other men 
whom small things can discourage, or small discontentments cause to 
wish themselves home again.” 
  JOHN SMITH’S MAP OF NEW ENGLAND 
This congregation of Separatists did not settle on an unknown coast. 
As ready with pen and compass as with sword and trumpet, John 
Smith had explored it in 1614 and had named it New England. He 
had made a map of this new land and had written a book about it. 
He noted the abundant furs, the good timber, and the rich pastures. 
He had sowed seeds and later had eaten the “sallets” therefrom. “Of all the four parts of the world that I 
have yet seen not inhabited, could I have but means to transport a colony, I would rather live here than

THE FIRST BOAT ASHORE, 
PROVINCETOWN HARBOR 
“Arter longe beating at sea” says Bradford, “they fell in 
with that land which is called Cape Cod; the which being 
made & certainly knowne to be it, they were not a little 
joyfull.” But “they fell among dangerous shoulds and ror- 
ing breakers.”” So they decided to bear north for the Cape 
“and the next day they gott into the Cape-harbor where 
they ridd in safetie.” Captain Standish with fifteen men 
landed on the shore. ‘When they had marched about the 
space of a mile by the sea side, they espied 5. or 6. persons 
with a dogg coming towards them, who were salvages.” 
The Indians “rane up into the woods.” That night the 
Standish party camped on the shore “& set out their sen- 
tinels.” 
SIGNING THE MAYFLOWER COMPACT 
Tue day before the ship came into Provincetown harbor, 
the Pilgrims drew up their historic Compact. Says Brad- 
ford, “it was thought good that there should be an associa- 
tion and agreement, that we should combine together in one 
body, and to submit to such government and governors as 
we should by common consent agree to make and choose; 
and set our hands to this that follows, word for word.” 
The Pilgrims were interlopers in the north without right 
to land and without a charter allowing them to set up a government. The formal compact was a plantation 
covenant. It not only established their relations with one another but gave a semblance of legality to their 
governmental arrangements which might prove useful. In this plantation covenant a respect for law and 
order that is typically English makes itself manifest.

“THE LANDING 
OF THE 
PILGRIMS” 
In a literal sense no formal 
“landing” of the Pilgrims ever 
occurred. Scouts were sent out 
to explore the country. By 
gradual stages, life on board 
ship was changed for life on 
land. But the “landing of the 
Pilgrims” has passed into the 
traditions of the American 
people as a symbol of the high 
ideals and the religious faith 
which were first planted in the 
New World by this small band 
of dissenters. There is drama 
in the story of the wandering 
Pilgrims. The name Pilgrim 
itself was a happy choice. The 
history of their adventure has 
entered into the warp and woof of American thought and has been used again and again to recall Americans 
to high ideals and to religious sacrifice. The “landing” is celebrated at Plymouth annually on Dec. 21. 
Plymouth Rock is preserved within a 
classic marble monument. No American 
would have it otherwise. The story of the 
“landing” has taken its place in literature 
and art. Many generations have symbol- 
ized their own ideals in their representa- 
tions of this beginning in America of the 
Pilgrim enterprise. Of late years, when 
America has grown in world significance, 
foreign artists have contributed to the 
growing gallery of Pilgrim pictures. 
The whole great movement from the 
Old World to the New was full of drama. 
Perhaps there is a certain unfairness in 
selecting one small group for immortality, 
when so many pioneers in early America 
endured equal hardships and crossed the

Mrs. Susanna White, mother of Peregrine White, the 
first child born in the colony. He made treaties 
with the Indians, served as governor, and on several 
occasions was sent to England to defend the colony 
against traducers. In 1646 he went to England and 
held a post under Cromwell for nine years. He died 
in Jamaica whither Cromwell had sent him to advise 
with Admiral Penn and General Venables. He wrote 
much about New England, sometimes perhaps too 
enthusiastically for strict accuracy.

MYLES STANDISH, ca. 1584-1656 
“Captain STANDISH was bred a soldier in the Low 
Countries,” says an early writer. “A little chimney 
is soon fired; so was the Plymouth captain a man of 
small stature, yet of a very hot and angry temper.” 
In the first winter at Plymouth, when disease wiped 
out half the colony, it was to the ministrations of this 
splendid little fighting man and the gentle Elder 
Brewster that many of the survivors owed their lives. 
The portrait comes from an old panel bearing the 
name “M. Standish,” found in a picture shop in 
Philadelphia. The genuineness has never been 
proved. 
  
  EARLY PLYMOUTH 
‘Tue church covenant and organi- 
zation had from the beginning 
been the central bond in this 
group of Pilgrim settlers. They 
were independent of any estab- 
lished religious organization, and 
they managed their religious 
affairs through the congregation. 
This congregational system was 
later adopted by the Puritans of 
Massachusetts who, when they 
left England, believed they were 
yet in the Anglican church. This 
reconstruction of early Plymouth 
is based on probabilities; few 
facts are available.

LEYDEN STREET, 
PLYMOUTH 
Tuis reconstruction was based 
on the following description by 
Isaac de Rasiere, who visited 
Plymouth from New Amsterdam 
in 1627: 
“New Plymouth lies on the 
slope of a hill stretching east 
towards the sea-coast, with a 
broad street about a cannon shot 
of 800 [yards] long, leading 
down the hill; with a [street] 
crossing in the middle, north- . 
wards to the rivulet and south- § e 5 Es 
wards to the land. The houses 
are constructed of hewn planks, 
with gardens also enclosed behind and at the sides with hewn planks, so that their houses and court yards 
are arranged in very good order, with a stockade against a sudden attack; and at the ends of the streets 
there are three wooden gates. In the centre, on the cross street, stands the Governor’s house, before which 
is a square enclosure upon which four patereros [swivel guns] are mounted, so as to flank along the streets. 
Upon the hill they have a large square house, with a flat roof, made of thick sawn plank, stayed with oak 
beams, upon the top of which they have six cannons, which shoot iron balls of four and five pounds, and com- 
mand the surrounding country. The lower part they use for their church, where they preach on Sundays and 
the usual holidays. They assemble by beat of drum, each with his musket or firelock, in front of the captain’s 
door; they have their cloaks on, and place themselves in order, three abreast, and are led by a sergeant without 
beat of drum. Behind comes the Governor, in a long robe; beside him, on the right hand, comes the preacher 
with his cloak on, and on the left hand the captain with his side arms, and cloak on, and with a small cane in 
his hand, — and so they march in good order, and each sets his arms down near him. Thus they are con- 
stantly on their guard night and day. ... Their farms are not so good as ours, because they are more 
stony, and consequently not so suitable for the plough. They apportion their land according as each has 
means to contribute to the Eighteen Thousand Guilders which they have promised to those who had sent them 
out; whereby they have their freedom without rendering an account to anyone.” — From New York His-

   THE COMING OF SAMOSET AND SQUANTO 
Tue Indians, who until now had remained in the background, had 
been secretly observing the white men at their building; and the 
colonists feared that an attack was imminent. One day in March a 
tall savage walked into the settlement and greeted the Pilgrims with 
“Welcome, Englishmen.” This was Samoset, chief of Monhegan 
Isle, a friend of English traders and fishers. Samoset said that he had 
sent for two friends of his, Massasoit, the greatest chief of Massachu- 
setts, and Squanto, who -had visited England on a trading ship and 
who could speak English well. Thereupon the Pilgrims made a feast 
for Samoset and gave him a knife and a ring. 
A few days after Samoset’s visit, Massasoit came with his warriors 
and his friend Squanto, and there was concluded a treaty which the 
Indians did not break for fifty years. Squanto became so enamored 
of his new friends that he moved into Plymouth, living with one or 
another of the Pilgrims and sometimes as Bradford’s guest. In 
return for this hospitality he taught them how to fertilize the soil 
with fish, how to trap beaver, how to stalk game and how to raise corn.

OLD FORT, BURIAL HILL 
In spite of such evidences of harmony, well did these Englishmen know that they lived close neighbors to a 
barbarous race that might at any time attack their tiny settlement. It was a wise foresight that turned 
their attention to the building of a fort as one of their first tasks. Whether the illustration represents the type 
of fort they built is open to doubt. Bradford says that the fort had battlements and ordnance.     
   INTERIOR OF THE FORT 
Wirutn the fort were arms and 
accoutrements ready for that 
time — which happily never 
came to Plymouth — when this 
should be the citadel for defense 
against a rising of the Indians. 
The long, awkward matchlocks 
with their forked supports were 
but clumsy weapons against the 
agile redskins; yet they sufficed. 
The armor, relic of the fights of 
medizval Europe, proved use- 
ful against Indian arrows though 
impeding ease of action. But 
as fire-arms improved and came 
into the possession of the red- 
men, the white settlers gradu- 
ally laid aside breastplate and 
helmet and adopted the Indian 
mode of forest fighting.

       MASSASOIT, INDIAN CHIEF 
In Mourt’s Relation or Journal (London, 1622), written probably by 
Winslow and Bradford, is summed up the early Indian relations: “we 
have found the Indians very faithful in their covenant of peace with us, 
very loving and ready to pleasure us . . . not only the greatest king 
amongst them, called Massasoyt, but also all the princes and peoples 
round about us, have either made suit unto us, or been glad of any occa- 
sion to make peace with us. ... So that there is now great peace 
amongst the Indians themselves, which was not formerly, neither would 
have been but for us; and we, for our part, walk as peaceably and safely 
in the wood as in the highways in England.”

THE PLYMOUTH 
PATENT 
Tue patent of Plymouth Colony, 
the oldest state document in New 
England, gave the Pilgrims an 
actual title to the land on which 
they hitherto had been squatters, 
but it conferred no powers of gov- 
ernment (since from the king only 
could come such powers), leaving 
the extra-legal Mayflower compact 
the sole basis for government 
organization. The patent was 
issued by the President and Council 
for New England on June 1, 1621, 
to John Peirce and his associates 
(the Pilgrims), and it was brought 
out to America in the Fortune in 
the same year. The document was 
signed and sealed by the Duke of 
Lenox, the Marquis of Hamilton, 
the Earl of Warwick, Lord Shef- 
field, and Sir Ferdinando Gorges.

BRADFORD'S “HISTORY OF PLIMOTH PLANTATION” 
Braprorp, who for so many years was governor of Plymouth, has 
preserved by his pen for later generations the living story of the 
Pilgrim adventure. One has but to turn his pages to catch glimpses 
of the life of those far-off days: Bradford grumbling because the 
supply of beer is almost exhausted; the difficulty of getting out of 
the common house the day it caught fire; the man and his dog who 
held two wolves at bay; the Christmas dinner of wild duck; the 
difficulties that the colony encountered in dealing with some of the

THE FIRST THANKSGIVING 
TureEe winters passed. In the spring of 1623 the Pilgrims again planted their corn, as Squanto had taught 
them, with a fish in each hill for fertilizer. Bradford records the growing anxiety of the settlers as the drought, 
which began in May, continued into July. Faced with the possible Sec ae their corn dhe little colony 
“sett aparte a solemne day of humiliation, to seek the Lord 
by humble and fervente prayer.” During all the morning, 
and most of the afternoon of this day the sun shone in a 
clear sky. But with evening came abundant rain “both to 
thier owne and the Indeans admiration.” Other rains 
brought a plentiful harvest. ‘For which mercie (in time 
conveniente) they also sett aparte a day of thanksgiveing.”

Davis (pp. 152-3). 
  THE PILGRIMS’ DISORDERLY NEIGHBORS 
Bort the Pilgrims soon had neighbors in New England. An 
ever-merry gentleman named Thomas Morton came to 
Mount Wolloston in 1622 and by his conduct with his friends 
and the Indians grievously scandalized the Plymouth folk. 
While the May-pole he set up, his revels around it, and the 
slurring bulletins about his good neighbors which he hung 
upon it were a trial to a Christian’s spirit, his rash and 
illegal trading of fire-arms and liquor to the Indians was a 
serious menace to the little colonies. Morton was without 
legal title to the land he occupied. Once he was banished 
to England by the Pilgrims after Captain Standish had cap- 
tured him. Returning, he was again sent back; but this 
time it was the new colony of Massachusetts Bay which 
exercised authority. ‘in the Settlement of America, ts, Pioneers Boston, 1876

PILGRIMS AND PURITANS IN NEW ENGLAND 
CHARLES I, 1600-1649 
On the death of James in 1625, Charles became 
king. As he was a charming and engaging prince, 
all England hailed him joyously. But ere the 
year was out, Parliament and King had entered 
upon the struggle which was to end with his 
execution. Ultimately Charles dissolved the 
House, whose members had passed resolutions 
censuring him. For eleven years he governed 
without a Parliament by means of his army, 
sheriffs, judges, and bishops, and he drew his 
income from autocratic levies on the people. The 
dismissed Parliament leaders rode up and down 
England preaching the liberties and rights of 
Englishmen in every town, port, and country 
hamlet.

WILLIAM LAUD, ARCHBISHOP OF 
CANTERBURY, 1573-1645 
Lavup was a High Churchman, who disliked Calvinism 
in all its forms. He stood well with both Stuarts and, 
when Charles came to the throne, Laud rose rapidly. 
In 1633 he became Archbishop of Canterbury. The 
policy of suppressing all expression of dissent from the 
established church was now pursued energetically; 
and Laud, as agent of the royal will, was given full 
powers. The great exodus of Puritans to New England 
was largely the 
result of his zeal- 
ous activities.

OLIVER CROMWELL, 1599-1658 
Outver Cromwett became the military and political leader of the 
revolt which overthrew the house of Stuart and established the Com- 
monwealth in England. “Tronsides” was the name given to Cromwell 
by the Royalists after their first encounter with him on the battlefield. 
He led the troops of Parliament to victory. By diplomacy and the 
sword he compelled Europe to recognize the Commonwealth. He 
fought Spain, the traditional enemy, and opposed the rising power of 
Holland. But during his sway the founding of new English colonies in 
America, save for the capture of Jamaica, came to an end. Englishmen 
were too busy with problems at home to seek new enterprises in 
America.

  210 THE PAGEANT OF 
EXECUTION OF CHARLES I 
Tue Puritans conquered in the civil war that rent England 
from 1642 to 1646. Their movement was largely political in 
its effects, though centering in an ecclesiastical issue. During 
the thirties, in the days of the king’s supremacy, thousands 
of the Puritan party had left England for Massachusetts and 
other New England colonies. When civil war broke out the 
exodus stopped. Now that the Puritans were victorious, they 
held the king prisoner. Exasperated by the Royalist doctrine 
that the king could not be bound by engagements entered 
into by him while under duress, and fearing treachery, they 
beheaded him. There was joy unstinted in distant Massa- 
chusetts when the news was brought across the seas.

THE CHARTER OF 
MASSACHUSETTS, 1629 
Tue charter was issued on March 4, 
1629, to “the Governor and Company 
of the Massachusetts Bay in New Eng- 
land.” To them it gave the seafront 
from three miles north of the Merri- 
mac River to three miles south of the 
Charles, and westward to the “South 
Sea,” or Pacific. The company re- 
mained in England for a year and did 
not go to Massachusetts until 1630. 432 From the original in the State House, Boston AMERICA

New England outside of Plymouth had been granted tothe Council for 
New England. Sir Ferdinando Gorges, who was a prominent member 
of this Council, had schemes for developing the region. But a charter 
for a new company granted the very heart of New England to a 
trading company of the type of the Virginia Company, and its mem- 
bership was both Anglican and Nonconformist. That land should be 
taken in such manner from one organization and given to another was 
probably largely due to the Puritan nobleman, the Earl of Warwick, 
one of the most powerful men in England, and one deeply interested

PILGRIMS AND PURITANS IN NEW ENGLAND il 
JOHN ENDICOTT, ca. 1588-1665 
In the organization of the new company John Endicott was 
a prime mover. His first step had been to get a land patent 
from the New England Council to the district between the 
Charles and the Merrimac. Then he sailed for America 
with a band of colonists and founded Salem in 1628. The 
incorporation of the Massachusetts Bay Company followed 
almost immediately. He was an able but self-righteous and 
fanatical man, a scourge of “heretics,” and an instigator of 
the persecution of witches—a mirror, indeed, of the 
strangely blended virtues and dark qualities of that period 
in the life of the American colonies. 
JOHN WINTHROP, 1588-1649 
Winturop, a Puritan country squire deprived of his office 
as attorney in the Court of Wards by Charles I’s policy 
toward the Puritans, saw in the new Massachusetts Bay 
Company an opportunity for himself and his party associates. 
He decided to give up

Such was his activity and ability in the new company that, when it 
was decided to leave England, he was promptly elected governor. 
The control of this enterprise which the Puritans had bought up 
now passed to a group which purposed removal to America. On 
March 29, 1630, at Cowes, England, four ships set sail, followed a 
week or two later by seven others bearing the rest of the adventurers. 
With them went the charter. In this way the charter of a trading 
company became the instrument of government for a colony. 
  ARRIVAL OF WINTHROP’S SHIPS 
IN BOSTON HARBOR 
On board the ships were many men of ability and position who were 
leaving England because of political conditions. A very large number 434 From the portrait of John Winthrop, by 
came to get land and to found a new home in the wilderness. A 
number were not Puritans and a few were in sympathy with the Anglican church. The new colonists did 
not reach Salem until June 
and July, 1630. In August 
they moved to Charlestown, 
and the first meeting of the 
company on American soil 
was held. But, as the water 
supply proved poor, the set- 
tlers moved on to Boston.

GOING TO CHURCH 
Tue Puritan leaders were Calvinists who 
believed firmly in Calvin’s ecclesiastical 
government in Geneva. The little 
Massachusetts towns that sprang up 
about Boston were each centered in the 
church. No one could be a freeman and 
participate in the political life of the 
colony who was not a church member, 
and the membership was carefully re- 
stricted and supervised. Rigid laws 
compelled all to support and attend the 
institutions of worship.

PILGRIMS AND PURITANS IN NEW ENGLAND 213 
RICHARD MATHER, 1596-1669 
In England Gorges, of the New England Council, in- 
sisted bitterly that the charter of Massachusetts was a 
direct violation .of his“proprietary rights. He fought the 
charter with such success that, in 1635, an investigating 
commission issued a writ of quo warranto against the 
colony. But disturbed conditions in England prevented 
the serving of the writ and thus saved Massachusetts. 
Persecution of the Puritan party in England drove to 
Massachusetts a number of men of real ability. Among them 
were John Cotton and Richard Mather. Mather left behind 
him in England a reputation for inspirational preaching, and 
there was rivalry among the churches in Massachusetts to 
secure his ministration. He went to little Dorchester, which 
had been depleted by migrations westward, and there he 
remained until his death. He was one of those who gave 
shape to New England Congregationalism. Men like Cotton 
and Mather shared with the civil leaders like Winthrop the 
control of the colony. The picture is believed to be the first 
woodcut made in America.    438 From 8. A. Green, Ten Facsimile Reproductions,

  JOHN COTTON: “PATRIARCH OF NEW 
ENGLAND,” 1585-1652 
Tue real rulers in Massachusetts were a small group of 
Puritan laymen and ministers. John Cotton, one of 
the leading Puritans in England, and rector of St. 
Botolph’s Church in Boston, Lincolnshire, fled in dis- 
guise from the king’s soldiers, took ship for America, 
and in 1633 was elected teacher to the First Church in 
Boston, Mass. His influence was like that of a prophet 
in Israel. He believed firmly in the theocratic state.

ROGER WILLIAMS, ca. 1604-84 
Tue hand of the clergy lay heavy on early Massa- 
chusetts. A small ecclesiastical hierarchy, coupled 
with a group of magistrates held in office by the 
freemen who comprised but one-fifth of the adult 
population, directed the religious and civil life of 
this frontier community. These men who left Eng- 
land because they would not conform to certain pre- 
scribed Anglican practices in turn allowed not the 
slightest deviation from the worship which they 
themselves ordained. The first prominent man to 
revolt against this domination was Roger Williams. 
Always independent and outspoken, Williams 
asserted in Salem that the state had no authority 
over the consciences of men, and that the only 
valid title to the land of the Colony must be 
obtained from the Indians. But this was in 1635, 
and so radical a spirit was banished.

SIR RICHARD SALTONSTALL, 1586-1658 
SaLronstaLL, a member of the British gentry, was from the 
beginning prominent in the Massachusetts Bay enterprise. 
His liberalism and tolerance caused him many times to differ 
with the methods and the point of view of the magistrates 
and clergy. He returned to England within the first year. 
He later became one of the patentees of the Saybrook settle- 
ment (at the mouth of the Connecticut River) and so aided

by taking the side of Mrs. Hutchinson rather than that of the 
clergy. When his year of office was over, the Hutchinson con-

Ir the banishment of Williams caused no

her side, but even they could not prevail 
against the aroused phalanx of the Massa-

and surrendered. Mrs. Hutchinson was 
tried by the General Court and was “ban- 
ished out of our jurisdiction as being a 
woman not fit for our society.”” When she 
said, “I desire to know wherefore I am 
banished,” Governor Winthrop replied, 
“Say no more; the Court knows wherefore 
and is satisfied.” In 1643, she and her family 
were murdered by Indians in the neighbor-

SOME LAWS OF THE COMMONWEALTH 
SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY laws in Europe were harsh, as were 
the punishments meted out for their infraction. They reflect 
the social development of the time. Those promulgated in 
Massachusetts reflected strongly the ideas of the Puritans 
who were in control of the colony. The laws have an Old 
Testament flavor and rigor that marked the conceptions of 
a clergy who believed that God was sending more than half 
of mankind at death to the unutterable terrors of an eterna] 
Hell. If divine justice decreed that the unbaptized infant 
could not be saved, man must not show softness in the face 
of carnal offense. In the making of such laws as these the 
majority of the people had no voice. Large numbers who 
were neither Puritans nor church members chafed at the 
severity and the ridigity of the code thus imposed upon them. 
Almost from the beginning Massachusetts was the scene of a 
struggle of the people for a greater share in the government. 
In 1634, the freemen demanded a sight of the charter and then 
found that for four years they had been deprived of some of 
their important rights. But as time went on the freemen them- 
selves became a minority. Inevitably dissatisfaction grew.

MAP OF EARLY MASSACHUSETTS TOWNS 
In spite of a theocratic government, Massachusetts grew. Thousands of people came in the decade between 
1630 and 1640. Some were members of the Puritan party in England, having left the home country because 
Charles I had the upper hand for the time being and was making life unpleasant for his opponents. Others 
5 came because the land of America offered opportunities to 
start life afresh, and pointed the way to the economic and 
social advance of the individual. Town after town was 
established. Each followed the precedent established by 
Plymouth and built the village around the church. The 
village and the congregation were practically one and the 
same. Together they formed the social, political and 
religious unity of the New England settlements. As the 
frontier advanced northward and westward, the hunting 
grounds of the Indians diminished year by year.

FLIGHT OF ROGER WILLIAMS 
FROM MASSACHUSETTS 
Anxious as were the common people to develop 
a peaceful and comfortable community life, the 
bigotry and intolerance of their leaders in Massa- 
chusetts was impairing the best interests of the 
colony. They banished Roger Williams, but ere 
they could send him to England, he escaped into 
the wilderness. He spent the winter with his 
Indian friends planning a new colonial venture 
over which the Massachusetts clergy should have 
no control. The following spring saw him at his 
new settlement, which he called Providence. 
Thither, during the next two years, came a small 
group of colonists who found Massachusetts in- 
tolerable. Thus began, on the very flank of the 
Bay Colony, the settlement that was later known 
as Rhode Island.

A Yew sentences from a letter

1670 bespeak the man. “The

these childern’s toys of land, 
meadows, cattel, government, 
etc. But here all over this

weake and distressed soules,

THE HOOKER PARTY MIGRATES TO HARTFORD, 1636 
Bur there were others dissatisfied with Massachusetts. In 1634 
Thomas Hooker asked leave for himself and others to go to Connecti- 
cut, urging “the want of accommodation for their cattle . . . the 
Connecticut and the danger of having it possessed by others, Dutch

that the exodus of this congre- 
gation would weaken Massa- 
chusetts “‘and also divert other 
friends that would come to 
us.” But under date of May 
31, 1636, Winthrop writes: “‘Mr. 
Hooker, pastor of the church of 
Newton, and the most of his 
congregation, went to Connec- 
ticut. His wife was carried in 
a horse litter; and they drove 
one hundred and sixty cattle, 
and fed of their milk by the 
way.” The fertility of the Con- 
necticut valley was doubtless an 
influence increasing the desire to 
escape the Massachusetts régime.

THE FUNDAMENTAL 
ORDERS OF 
CONNECTICUT 
Tue Connecticut River towns 
— Hartford, Wethersfield, and 
Windsor — were the outgrowth 
of Hooker’s migration. Com- 
mittees from these met in “a 
Gen’all cort at Harteford” in 
1638-39 and framed the “ Funda- 
mental Orders” of Connecticut. 
Many of the principles of this 
remarkable document had been 
set forth by Hooker in a sermon 
in May, 1638. According to the 
“Orders,” the governor was re- 
quired to be a church member; 
the governor was to be elected 
by the voters; more power was 
given to the freemen and less 
to the magistrates. It was a 
somewhat Utopian attempt to 
apply: the ideal of individual 
rights as suggested in Hooker's 
plea, “As God has given us 
liberty, to take it.” But so 
ideal a purpose could not be 
maintained, and __ limitations 
upon the right to vote were 
imposed twenty years later.

SAYBROOK FORT, 1636 
As Charles I continued in his efforts to govern England without the aid of Parliament, a group of prominent 
Puritans, including Lord Saye and Sele, Lord Brooke, Sir Richard Saltonstall, John Hampden, and John Pym, 
desired to prepare a refuge in America, should the worst menace come true. They supposed they had a 
grant of land from Warwick 
in what is now southern 
New England. Of this 
territory they appointed 
John Winthrop, junior, goy- 
ernor. In 1635 Winthrop 
erected a fort and called 
the place Saybrook, after 
two of the chief promoters 
of the venture. Like other 
Puritans seeking to found 
a refuge in America should 
conditions become so bad 
as to make one necessary, 
these leaders avoided the 
Massachusetts Bay colony 
on account of its narrow,

Connecticut, which in the meantime had (as was supposed) 
acquired title to the territory by purchase of the Warwick

Harpty had Saybrook and the Connecticut River towns been founded when Indian war menaced the new

without intimidating the redmen. The River towns, in deadly danger, saw in the Pequots their chief enemy.

PILGRIMS AND PURITANS IN NEW ENGLAND 
ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION, 1643 
To meet the dangers of the new country, the New England 
Settlements federated. The United Colonies of New 
England, usually called the New England Confederation, 
included Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Haven and 
Plymouth. Rhode Island, that center of religious non- 
conformity, was excluded from participation. It was 
not yet considered a respectable member of the New 
England community. The Confederation endured 
forty-one years. The articles were agreed upon at 
Boston on May 19, 1643, John Winthrop, senior, pre- 
siding. Provisions were made for joint defense of the 
colonies and for one standard measure of “eight gallons 
to the bushell.” Letters of remonstrance were written 
to the Dutch and the Swedes, whose roving cattle had 
destroyed corn belonging to the colonists. 
It was urged that every man give “the fourth part of 
a bushel of Corne” to maintain the “publike schooles” 
and that a general fund be created “for the mayntenance 
of poore Schollers at the Colledge at Cambridge.” A 
sentence passed by one colonial court was to have equal 
weight in every other. Here was an early form of or- 
ganization not dissimilar to the Articles of Confederation 
of 1781. “All the forces which were destined to create 
the United States were present and at work in connection 
with the Confederation. Expansion, the sense of need 
of common action, compromise, and a written agreement 
to work together were all typical of the later stages of

JOHN ELIOT, 1604-90 
Tue advance of the frontier presaged disaster 
for the Indians. Using legal forms which the 
Indians could not understand, the whites, ruth- 
less and determined, took parcel after parcel 
of the Indian hunting grounds and pushed the 
dispossessed hunters northward and westward 
into strange forests and among strange tribes. 
Yet, among the invaders occasionally a man 
appeared in whom the contact of the races roused 
a spirit of brotherhood. Intellectual capacity, 
religious devotion, courage, and selflessness were 
conspicuous in this “Apostle to the Indians” 
who arrived in Boston in 1631 and shortly after- 
ward began at Roxbury his life work, the 
Christianization and education of the redmen. 
Eliot’s translation of the Scriptures into the 
native tongue was the first Bible printed in the 
New World. He established towns for his Indian 
converts who, ere his death, numbered about 
four thousand.

CHAPTER XI 
NEW NETHERLAND AND NEW YORK 
r | HOSE provinces of the Netherlands lying north of the mouth of the Rhine, and 
now called Holland, had been swept by the Reformation. The southern 
provinces, Flanders and Belgium, had remained chiefly Catholic. But both 
Protestant and Catholic Netherlanders had a common bond in the great commercial 
prosperity of their land and in the vigor and independence of their own spirit. When 
Philip II of Spain, however, became King of the Netherlands, he made attempts to stamp 
out Protestantism and thereby wrecked the commerce and fraternity of that once 
thriving country. No longer could two hundred and fifty sails be counted on one day 
at Antwerp, nor could the strange habit of Russian or Levantine merchant be seen in 
the marts of Bruges or Leyden. Trade came to a standstill; shops were closed; and 
Spanish helmet and halberd took the place of the merchant’s beaver hat and silver- 
mounted staff. , 
The independent spirit of the Netherlands, however, could not brook such tyranny. 
The resistance to the Spaniards’ abuse of power was not confined to the Protestant 
provinces, but it was stronger there. Its moving spirit was William, Prince of Orange, 
surnamed The Silent. William acquired it by keeping silent when the French King spoke 
incautiously in his presence of an agreement between Spain and France for destroying 
Protestantism in the Low Countries. ‘‘From that hour,’’ William said later, ‘I resolved 
with my whole soul to do my best to drive this Spanish vermin out of the land.” The 
union and independence of the provinces of the north was his work, though he was 
murdered before that work was consummated. In 1609 a twelve-year truce was signed 
with Spain. The Spanish would not recognize the independence of the Netherland States 
for many years to come (1648). But the hardy, stubborn Dutchmen knew that the 
alien yoke was broken. 
During the war the Dutch had built up a navy again, chiefly for the hounding of 
Spanish treasure ships. These pirate ships, or “Beggars of the Sea,” as they were called, 
were now well fitted for the task of raising Holland once more to its old position of 
commercial affluence. Even before the true Dutch East India Company had been formed, 
in 1602, Dutch armed vessels had fought their way to India, Africa, the Spice Islands, 
and home again with rich cargoes. Nineteen years later the Dutch West India Company 
came into being to operate in the western hemisphere, and more particularly about the 
river which Henry Hudson, sailing for the older company, had discovered in 1609. The 
years of Dutch trading and colonization on the Hudson were the years of Holland’s 
greatness on the sea and in the realm of art and letters. The East India Company estab- 
lished a chain of forts and factories from the Cape of Good Hope to Japan. The West 
India Company invaded the West Indies and conquered a large part of Brazil. At home, 
Rubens and Rembrandt painted, Grotius wrote his history, and the great Vondel laid 
the foundations of a national school of literature.

AMSTERDAM 
ABOUT 1690 
AmsterpAM, “the dyke 
or dam of the Amstel,” 
takes its name from the 
dam built in 1240 by a 
Lord of Amstel to keep 
the sea out of a lit- 
tle fishing village. The 
canals of the modern city 
mark the lines of fortified 
walls built by other lords 
as the centuries passed. 
Amsterdam was _ the 
headquarters of those 
sovereign commercial or- 
ganizations, the Dutch 
East and West India 
Companies. It was the 
center of learning, and 
was proud of its reputa- 
tion as a “harborer of all 
sorts of heresies,’ where 
the oppressed found a refuge for themselves and their opinions. Financially Amsterdam was the successor 
of medieval Bruges and regulated exchange for Europe. It was also a center of literature and art. There 
Vondel wrote and read his poems. There, in the quarters of the Jewish diamond-cutters, lived Rembrandt 
and Spinoza. Into its harbor came the sails of the Beggars of the Sea.     467 From Carolus Allard, Orbis Habitabilis, Amsterdam, ca. 1690 
THE HALF-MOON PASSING THE PALISADES 
Henry Hvpson, English navigator and explorer, 
‘sailing for the British Muscovy Company in 1607-08, 
sought in two voyages a northeast route to the trading 
centers of Asia and to the coasts of Spitzbergen and 
Novaya Zemlya. On his return he was commissioned 
by the Dutch East India Company to seek a route to 
China. With eighteen or twenty men he sailed on 
this new quest in the Half-Moon on April 6, 1609. A 
month later he was among the ice near Novaya Zemlya 
on his old route. Then, disregarding his instructions, 
he abandoned his attempt for a northeast passage and 
sought a northwest route past the continent of North 
America. In June, Hudson was on the Kennebec 
River, providing a new mast for the Half-Moon and 
having a brush with Indians. He dropped south, and 
standing in to shore, coasted north. On September 3, 
he entered the lower bay of New York, and on the 
12th saw Manhattan Island. 
A majestic river opened before him and he sailed 
northward to above the site of Albany. Then he turned 
back, satisfied that this river would not lead him to 
China. Hudson had found a great river, and exploded 
the popular myth that in “North Virginia,” about the 
40th parallel, there was another isthmus like Panama.

THE INDIANS, ee 
1609 >) eee a 
On September 5, some @ a an 
days before upper New 
York bay was discovered, 
the Indians in “two 
Canoes, the one having 
twelve, and the other 
fourteen men,” attacked 
John Coleman, an Eng- 
lishman, and four others 
who had been in the Kill 
von Kull, sighting Newark 
Bay, and were on their 
way back to the Half- 
Moon. Coleman was shot 
“with an Arrow into his 
throat, and two more 
hurt.” Coleman was 
buried at a point named (Colman’s) in his honor, which has been identified with both Sandy Hook and 
Norton Point. 
Hudson, sailing northward, landed somewhere below Albany and was feasted by the Indians. September 
22, Robert Juet, mate of the Half-Moon, noted in his log: “So at three of the clocke in the after-noone they 
(the Indians) came aboord, and brought Tobacco, and 
\ more Beades, and gave them to our Master, and 
|; ‘ made an oration, and showed him all the country 
round.” This was perhaps above the mouth of 
the Mohawk. Hudson sailed away but again re- 
turned to America, this time in English employ. 
Again he sought a northwest passage and again he- 
left his name upon a magnificent body of water, 
Hudson’s Bay, where, cast off by his crew, he died.       From the painting by J. L. G. Ferris, in Independence Hall, Philadelphia 
  
MODEL OF THE ONRUST, 1614 
Lirrie Holland, about to enter upon a twelve years’ 
truce with Spain, was excited by the report of his 
explorations that Hudson sent to the Netherlands. 
Ambitious schemes for profit in the New World be- 
came the gossip of Amsterdam and Hoorn. Traders 
crossed the sea to the Hudson River to bargain with 
the Indians for furs and tobacco. Adriaen Block, one 
of these, lost his vessel by mischance in the region 
of the present city of Albany, and thereupon built 
another, the Onrust. He explored Long Island Sound, 
giving his name to Block Island. But in the early 
days the Dutch trade was desultory and its manage- 
ment by the government haphazard. Yet this same 
desultory trade served to open the eyes of Dutchmen 
to the possibilities of profit that were offered at the 
mouth of the Hudson. The model is an imaginary

NEW AMSTERDAM — SO-CALLED 
EARLIEST VIEW 
Tue destinies of New Netherland were con- 
fided in 1621 to the Dutch West India Com- 
pany. Peter Minuit, one of the directors 
whom they sent out, bought Manhattan 
from the Indians in 1626 and founded New 
Amsterdam. The Company’s ships now 
brought out colonists’ supplies and carried 
back furs. The powers of the Company were 
great. It had a monopoly of trade in Africa 
from the Tropic of Cancer to Good Hope, 
and on the American coast from Newfound- 
land to the Strait of Magellan. It was per- 
mitted to make alliances, to erect forts, to 
The States General, partners in all the Company’s ventures, 
In 1626 engineers came from Holland 
to construct Fort Amsterdam, destined to be the chief bulwark 
of Dutch power in America. 
LETTER RELATING THE PURCHASE 
OF MANHATTAN 
One Peter Schagen wrote as follows from Amsterdam to the 
States General of the Netherlands at The Hague under date of 
November 5, 1626: “‘High Mighty Sirs: Here arrived yesterday 
the ship The Arms of Amsterdam, which sailed from New Nether- 
land out of the Mauritius (Hudson) River on September 23; 
they report that our people there are of good courage and live 
peaceably . . . they have bought the island Manhattes from the 
wild men for the value of sixty guilders [$24] . . . the cargo of 
the aforesaid ship is: 7246 beaver skins, 178 1/2 otter skins, 
675 otter skins, 48 mink skins, 36 wild-cat skins, 33 minks, 
34 rat skins. Many logs of oak and nutwood. Herewith be ye 
High Mighty Sirs commended to the Almighty’s grace.” 
At New Amsterdam under Minuit the little handful ¥f settlers, 
save those who held public office, busied themselves with their 
private concerns. ‘Some were traders; others were farmers; and 
there were a few artisans. Each morning the cows were driven 
to the bowwerie as the common was called. The cattle belonged 
to the company but the milk was the property of the settlers. 
  
FORT ORANGE (ALBANY) 
Tux first settlement in New Nether- 
land was made in 1624 at Fort 
Orange, now the city of Albany. 
Formerly a few traders had wintered 
there on an adjoining island and had 
built, in 1615, a fort called Fort 
Nassau; but this island was aban- 
doned in 1617. The picture repre- 
sents the town and river traffic later 
in the Dutch régime.

  230 THE PAGEANT 
NEW NETHERLAND UNDER THE 
DUTCH WEST INDIA COMPANY 
Cotonists at first were slow to leave the trim, fertile 
fields of the Netherlands for the uncertain wilderness 
of America. Among the earlier colonists were pioneers 
for conscience’ sake, Protestant Walloons. Kiliaen 
van Rensselaer, a shrewd director of the West India 
Company, suggested the patroon system to build up an 
oversea population. Though he never came to America, 
he became the most famous of the patroons as the 
founder of Rensselaerswyck, near Fort Orange. 
A patroon was a feudal lord who might receive a 
grant of land anywhere in the colony save Manhattan 
Island, which was reserved for the Company. Usually 
the holdings lay along the Hudson. The patroon must 
bring colonists to New Amsterdam, equip them and 
settle them on his estate. They were his tenants, he, 
in a sense, their feudal overlord. So Dutch colonists 
were brought out to America. But at its best this 
* colonial system worked only fairly well, for conditions in 
undeveloped America were not favorable to the feuda- 
lism of medizeval Europe. Life in the American forest 
bred independence. The complicated legal arrange- 
ments of feudalism which were the result of hundreds 
of years of growth could not be transplanted to the 
primitive communities of America. 
THE FUR TRADE 
Trapg, not agriculture, was the basis of the prosperity 
of New Netherland. There was money to be made in 
shipping furs to the home land, and not many years 
passed before New Amsterdam assumed a solid and “F AMERICA

  comfortable appearance. Houses of masonry appeared, sometimes even aspiring to a certain grandeur. The 
newness and uncouthness of the first days gradually disappeared, and Manhattan became the abode of a 
growing number of householders, in whose tidy homes the best Dutch customs were maintained.

  NEW AMSTERDAM, ABOUT 1650 
Tux appearance of the little Dutch village, whose fortune it was to be the forerunner of the greatest metropolis 
of the western world, has long been a matter of interest and the early history of later famous streets has been 
diligently sought. A few sketches made during or shortly after the old Dutch days have been preserved. The 
earliest known is that of Hartgers (p. 229). Accompanying the Novum Belgium map (No. 476), so rich in 
drawings, is a second sketch of New Amsterdam in the days of Peter Stuyvesant, which sets forth in great 
detail the characteristics of this then prosperous colony and trading post. 
The fort, the windmill and the flagstaff were prominent features of the little Dutch town. At the left of 
the mill may be seen the tops of masts of trading ships tied up to the wharves on the far side of the island. 
This little village was the center of an agricultural community that lay about the mouth of the Hudson and 
along the banks of the great river and also of a fur trade that reached far into the interior. 
CATTLE FAIR AT 
NEW AMSTERDAM 
In 1641, Governor William Kieft founded 
the cattle fair at New Amsterdam. Not 
only cattle, however, were marketed there, 
but later all kinds of products were offered 
for sale. Cheeses, butter, laces, and 
linens were sold by the farmers’ wives in 
their booths. Indian women from the 
neighboring districts brought baskets, 
cradles, wooden dolls, furs, and berries. 
Pleasure went hand in hand with business, 
and songs and dances added to the joys 
of bartering. The Dutch early proved 
that they were as capable of adjusting 
their lives to the conditions in America 
as the Spanish or English. Like their 
neighbors they transplanted to the New 
World the customs which they had 
known in the old.

Tue good vrouw of those days, in her voluminous petticoats and linen cap, stretched her skein of flaxen

their laundry work.

PLAYING BOWLS ON BOWLING GREEN 
Wuite the sunset breeze slowly turned the windmill and carried the cool air from the bay over the narrow 
point of Manhattan Island, the sturdy burghers, their labors done, disported themselves on the Green. 
Nine pins was a favorite game. Bowling Green received its name sometime between 1730 and 1733, years 
after New York had come under English control.

THE RATTLE WATCH 
As dusk followed upon sunset, the Rattle Watch lighted their lanterns and made the rounds of New 
Amsterdam. It was house-time and bed-time for all good Dutch folk. Among other things they were re- 
quired “‘to call out how late it is, at all the corners of the streets, from nine o’clock in the evening until reveille 
beat in the morning,” and were to have a captain over them.

LONG ISLAND UNDER THE DUTCH 
New Amsterpam was the hub and not the boundary of early colonization. Of the first settlers sent out by 
the West India Company on the Niew Nederlandt in 1624, some went to the South River, now the Delaware, 
and the main body went up the Hudson to 
establish Fort Orange, the present Albany. 
Later arrivals founded settlements on the rolling 
hills at the west end of Long Island, Vlackte- 
Bosch and Breuckelen, as the Flatbush and 
Brooklyn of today were then known. In time 
the Dutch became well established in America. 
WILLIAM KIEFT 
Prrer Minvrr had first ruled New Amsterdam. 
He was followed by Wouter van Twiller who 
found difficult the task of directing the affairs 
of the colony. New England men encroached 
on the east and Virginians, aroused by the 
Dutch settlement on Delaware Bay, made 
threats. Van Twiller gladly relinquished his 492 From the painting Haict of William the Testy, by G. H. Boughton, 
post to William Kieft. And Kieft had to face ee eee ah ee 
the first great Indian war of the colony which did not end before the Dutch had been reduced to distress. 
The picture illustrates a fictitious*incident from Irving that the Dutch citizens of New Amsterdam smoked 
out a protest to Kieft’s edict against smoking. 
  PETER STUYVESANT, 1592?-1672 
Now enters the last and mightiest Director-General of New Nether- 
land, the redoubtable Peter Stuyvesant, brave as a lion and stubborn 
as a mule, a very able tyrant, who was perhaps just a shade better at 
stirring up trouble than he was at quelling it. He was a tall man witha 
large head, fierce little eyes, a big nose, square broad shoulders, and 
the voice of a thunder-god. He had lost a leg for his country and had 
replaced it with a wooden one. Proud indeed was Peter of his wooden 
leg. Though parsimonious enough generally, he lavished decorations 
upon this symbol of his military prowess: he bound it with silver bands 
and studded it with silver nails, and he polished bands and nails so that 
they glinted like a heaven of stars. Irreverent persons, behind his 
back, called him “Old Silver Nails.”

THE LANDING OF 
PETER STUYVESANT 
“T sHALL be as a father over 
his children,” Stuyvesant an- 
nounced to the reception com- 
mittee of burghers who greeted 
him on his landing on May 11, 
1647; and, that he might im- 
mediately inculcate in them the 
proper respect for parents, he 
kept them standing, with un- 
covered heads, for an hour 
while, king-like, he wore his 
hat. They soon learned that 
anyone who dared oppose the 
opinion of Peter Stuyvesant 
had ‘“‘as much as the sun and moon against him.”    er cll Sees. From the painting by Stanley M. Arthurs, in his possession 
  “THE WRATH OF PETER STUYVESANT” 
Proverst has become the temper of the last and greatest of the Dutch Directors. Stuyvesant ruled the 
colony with an iron hand. “It may,” he said, “during my administration be contemplated to appeal [to the 
home government]; but if anyone should do it, I will make him a foot shorter, and send the pieces to Holland 
and let him appeal in that way.” ‘“‘No one,”’ wrote van Tienhoven, who was sent out to whitewash the 
Director’s administration, “can prove that Director Stuyvesant has used foul language to or railed at as 
clowns any respectable persons who have treated him decently. It may be that some profligate person has 
given the Director, if he has used any bad words to him, cause to do so.” A large number of worthy and 
respectable burghers, however, felt that they must be included in the list of “profligate” persons. 
With all his faults, Peter Stuyvesant did more for the Dutch colony than any of his predecessors had done. 
He made treaties with the Indians, settled the vexed boundary question between the Dutch and English 
settlers on Long Island, and annexed the Swedish colony on the Delaware. He ordered the thoroughfares 
of New Amsterdam to be 
laid out as streets, and 
named, 
But by his arbitrary rule 
he alienated public support 
during the very years when 
Holland was allowing the 
defenses of the colony to fall 
to pieces by ignoring Stuy- 
vesant’s appeals for military 
and financial aid. The pic- 
ture is based on Irving’s im- 
aginary description of Stuy- 
vesant’s rage on learning of 
the surrender by the Dutch 
of Fort Casimir — he 
“thrust a prodigious quid of

THE FALL OF 
NEW AMSTERDAM 
War broke out between 
England and Holland. New 
and Old England co-oper- 
ated at once in an attack on 
New Netherland. Peter 
Stuyvesant, returning in 
haste from Fort Orange, 
saw four English ships at 
the mouth of the Hudson. 
Their commander, Colonel 
Richard Nicolls, demanded 
surrender of the “towns sit- 
uate on the island com- 
monly known by the name 
of Manhattoes, with all the 
forts thereunto belonging.” 
That meant all New Neth- 
erland. Fort Amsterdam,

SURRENDER OF NEW AMSTERDAM, 1664 
NIco.ts sent to Stuyvesant letters written by Governor John Winthrop of Connecticut and himself requesting ” a conference “‘about the premises.” The Director sparred for time, but capitulation was inevitable. Four 
days after the delivery of the English demand, six men, Sir Robert Carr, Colonel George Cartwright, Governor 
John Winthrop, Councillor Samuel Willys of Connecticut, Captain Thomas Clarke, and John Pinchon met 
with the representatives of Stuyvesant at the latter’s bouwery house where, next day, September 6 (New 
Style), 1664, the articles of surrender were signed. The picture of the Stuyvesant house is an elaboration 
of a cut made nearly a century ago by Benson J. Lossing.

Jasper Danckarrts and Peter Sluyter, two Hollanders of the Labadist sect, visited New York in 1679. 
Danckaerts kept a journal of their experiences and made drawings, among which are three pictures of old 
New York fifteen years after the British had first taken it. There are striking similarities between their 
drawing of the above view from Brooklyn Heights and that on the Visscher map (p. 231). In the quarter 
century and more that intervened between the two, the Manhattan skyline had been but little changed. 
But it was no longer a little trading village; it was already an infant city looking to a prosperous future.

THE FORT AT NEW YORK 
Surrs from Holland or later from 
England sailing up New York harbor 
saw first the fort with its tall flag- 
staff rising above the ramparts. Failure 
to keep this fortification in a condition 
of adequate preparedness had contrib- 
uted to the downfall of New Nether- 
land. The houses outside the walls 
with their steep gabled roofs, stepped

A VIEW OF NEW YORK 
FROM THE EAST, 1679 
Tus reduction from the Danck- 
aerts’ original sketch is the view 
of the town as seen from a point 
on the shore of the East River 
near the corner of the present 
Fulton and Water Streets. The 
perspective is a rather distorted 
one due to the bend in the river. 
The black line in the back- 
ground at the left is evidently in- 
tended for the Jersey shore. At 
the left end of the settlement ap- 
pears the north side of the Long 
Dock, with a couple of river 
craft moored alongside. Fol- 
lowing the line of the waterfront 
appear a row of quaint Dutch 
houses and then the orchard of 
Govert Lockerman, a prominent 
landmark. The large flag is on the Fort and next it is the church with a smaller flag. Both buildings, on ac- 
count of the perspective, seem to be too far away from their true positions. (Brevoort’s reconstruction of 
the Water Gate at the foot of 
e a ee ae 7] Wall Street (No. 495) is based 
we | onclose study of this drawing 
| : an by Danckaerts, and upon his 
own knowledge of the topog- 
raphy of the town.) The 
sketch of a Dutch merchant 
ship is quite clear, and the 
sloop in the foreground, pos- 
sibly the earliest view of an 
American-built vessel, is fly- 
ing the British flag appropri- 
ate to the time.

  ARRIVAL OF CAPTAIN KIDD IN NEW YORK HARBOR, 1696 
In days when privateer- 
ing was the custom of 
the seas, piracy was of 
frequent occurrence. 
Long Island and New 
York became a, pirates’ 
nest. The Earl of Bello- 
mont was commissioned 
governor to purge the 
colony of this commer- 
cial pest. He raised six 
thousand pounds and 
appointed William Kidd 
to drive the pirates from 
the sea lanes off Mada- 
gascar and bring home 
their booty. Kidd re- 
fitted and recruited in 
New York. The events 
that followed are blurred 
by conflicting accounts.

EARL OF BELLOMONT, 1636-1701 
Peruars Kidd did turn pirate when he found his 
prey had vanished. Perhaps he was carried about 
unwillingly by an unruly crew. Perhaps he 
captured, as he had asserted again and again, only 
French boats which his commission authorized. 
Upon his return, Bellomont with unbecoming 
duplicity had him arrested in Boston and sent 
to England for trial. The evidence against him 
was feeble, and his own former record had been 
one of distinguished service. Nevertheless, he 
was convicted of piracy and murder and was 
hanged. In legend Kidd has now become one of 
the most famous and romantic of pirates, but 
there are many who believe that both trial and 
rumor were unjust to the adventurous captain. 
Bellomont with whose name that of Kidd is 
forever linked served his colony well. Finding 
New York a nest of pirates and its politics shot 
through with corruption, he set out to bring 
decency into public life. His untimely death 
in 1701, after a brief rule of three years, brought 
to an end all his far-reaching schemes for the good 
of the colony.

Earty in the history of New

ware Bay, building Fort Nassau 
in 1624 in the present Gloucester 
County, New Jersey. Thencame 
more Dutchmen, led by David de 
Vries and two merchants named 
Godyn and Blommaert. Their 
colony, called Swannendael, was 
near Lewes, Delaware, and was de- 
stroyed by the Indians in 1632. 
Of this massacre De Vries wrote 
in his journal at the end of that 
year: “Found lying here and 
there the skulls and bones of 
our people and the heads of the 
horses and cows which they had 
brought with them . . . let the

of Swedes and Finns. He settled on the site of Wilming-

Tue territory purchased by Minuit extended westward 
from the Delaware River between the mouth of the Schuylkill 
and Bombay Hook. The boundaries of New Sweden were 
enlarged when a new company was chartered, and the 
energetic Johan Printz was commissioned, in 1642, as gov- 
ernor. Printz built Fort Elfsborg in Jersey near the mouth 
of Salem Creek and established New Gothenborg, which he 
made his capital, near the site of the present Chester, 
opposite the Dutch Fort Nassau. At the mouth of the 
Schuylkill he built another fort. Meanwhile a band of 
English from New Haven had founded a settlement at 
the present Salem in 1641 and, a little later, built a fort 
at the mouth of the Schuylkill. In 1651 Stuyvesant sent 
men to build near New Castle Fort Casimir, which was 
seized by the Swedes in 1654. The map drawn by the en-

“Tr it were my ship, I would not lower to these

passenger on the first vessel stopped by Printz’s 
orders in 1643, The captain, more cautious, obeyed 
the Swedish command. That night De Vries, 
the strongest man in New Netherland, dined with 
the strong man of New Sweden. The evening 
was spent in talk over a jug of Rhenish wine. 
Such friendly intercourse between Dutchmen and 
Swedes, together with the growing aggressions of 
the English against the colonies of both finally 
led, in 1651, to a temporary alliance. Yet, through 
it all the Dutch resented the presence of their 
Swedish neighbors on the south.

THE FALL OF NEW SWEDEN, 1655 
Tue Dutch, on their part, considered that the Swedes 
were infringing on their rights. Twenty years of 
contest for this disputed region ended when a Dutch 
fleet forced New Sweden to surrender. Besieged by 
Stuyvesant and defended by Governor Rising, Fort 
Christina fell in 1655. Lindstrém’s plan of the siege 
shows the fort (A) lying on a creek (B) between two 
swamps (P) and with the town of Christinahaven (C) 
behind it. The line of cannon at (M) marks the 
position of the besiegers. Stuyvesant’s ships lie at 
the mouth of the Fishkill. 
All the Swedish forts fell to the doughty governor 
of New Amsterdam. With them passed the power 
of Sweden in North America. For a few years the 
Dutch enjoyed the prestige of conquerors.

  THE LANDING OF PHILIP CARTERET IN NEW JERSEY 
In 1664, the fall of New Netherland occurred, and the land about the Hudson River and to the west and south 
of the harbor of New Amsterdam fell into the hands of its new English proprietors. In England Berkeley 
and Carteret bestirred themselves to secure settlers for their lands. They offered liberal terms, liberty of 
conscience, an allowance of two hundred acres of land in each parish for the maintenance of a minister that 
the parish should elect, and an elected assembly which should share with the governor in the management of 
the province. Philip Carteret, a kinsman of Sir George, was sent out to take charge of the settlements that 
had been founded in the days of the Dutch, and that were growing as people found the flats of New Jersey 
more attractive than the hill country of the province of New York. In 1668, Carteret convoked the first 
assembly at Elizabethtown.

ARRIVAL OF THE NEW ENGLANDERS AT NEWARK 
Tue Elizabethtown assembly passed a code of laws that were reminiscent of the Biblical code in the Puritan 
colony of New Haven. In fact, two years before, in 1666, a group of considerable size had come to New 
Jersey from the New Haven and Connecticut colonies. Some had come from other parts of New England. 
Carteret had granted them land in the northeast corner of the province. He was glad to have the new settlers, 
but he disliked the tenacity with which they held to the organization of their Puritan church and to their 
New England ways. When they sought through the assembly to impress their ideas on the whole province, 
a struggle ensued which ended in the break-up of the legislative body. In 1672, the colonists took matters 
into their own hands, chose an assembly of their own and elected as president James Carteret, a son of Sir 
George, who chanced to be in the colony. When the colony had gotten completely out of hand, Philip Carteret 
sailed for England to lay his case before the proprietors of New Jersey and the king.

SIR GEORGE CARTERET, ca. 1610-80 
Tue story of New Jersey is a complicated one. The life of the 
colony was disturbed by the Dutch reconquest of New York which 
ended in 1674. New Jersey had been divided between Berkeley 
and Carteret. In 1673 Berkeley sold his half of the province to two 
Quakers who were finally confirmed in their rights to ownership and 
jurisdiction. William Penn, in pleading their cause before the Duke 
of York, became for the first time familiar with the opportunities in 
America. He pursued his new interest actively. 
THE “QUINTIPARTITE DEED” 
In 1676, Sir George Carteret executed a “quintipartite deed.” This 
instrument fixed a line of partition from Little Egg Harbor to a point 
on the Delaware, in 41° 40’ latitude. The land to the east of this 
line (East Jersey) was assigned to Philip Carteret. West Jersey 
went to William Penn and a group of Quakers. The Quakers’ title, 513. From the portrait by Sir Peter Lely

  CHAPTER XII 
THE QUAKER EXPERIMENT 
k= two generations and probably more, the men of William Penn’s family had 
followed the sea; and part of their legacy to him was that love of freedom, that 
vigor, and that fearlessness in the presence of sudden peril or foe which are the 
gift of the sea to its sons. William’s grandfather, Giles Penn, a merchant captain of 
Bristol, had a brush or two with French and Spanish ships and with the pirate fleets of 
the Levant. His father, William Penn, was a naval captain at twenty-one and became 
a vice-admiral at twenty-three. He won distinction in the first Dutch war and in the 
capture of Jamaica from the Spanish. In 1653, as admiral and general under Cromwell, 
he drew up the first code of tactics for the navy, which was to guide English sea fighters 
for generations after him. Admiral Penn hoped, by his service at sea, to win an earldom, 
that he might bequeath it to his son, for he wished to see that handsome lad living the 
life which he imagined he would have preferred for himself. He took William to sea for 
a week or so during one engagement so that the boy might prove his manliness under 
the eyes of the Duke of York. This end accomplished, he sent him swiftly home. In 
like manner he allowed his son a taste of battle in Ireland, and then refused the youth 
his choice of a military career. Old William would do the rough work; young William 
must be the finest puppet in England. 
So young William, spurred by his heritage of vigor and courage and love of freedom, 
went adventuring in the only realm which his father could not close to him — the in- 
tellectual and spiritual domain. At Oxford, he took his stand with the liberals against 
ecclesiastical domination. He listened to the expositions of that remarkable Quaker, 
Thomas Loe; and in the Quaker concept of brotherhood and simple godliness William 
Penn found an ideal, and in the persecutions heaped upon a gentle people a battle-ground. 
He was imprisoned several times in England for his faith. He made a tour through 
Germany, where he preached the Quaker doctrine at the risk of his life. He found time 
to embody his ideas in several works on religion and on constitutional liberty. In the 
streets, and in prison, he proclaimed the rights of Englishmen. His profound study of 
English law and precedent was later reflected in the ‘‘frame of government” which he 
drew up for his colony and which insured to the colonists more liberty than was en- 
joyed at that time in England or in any other colony. 
His father, who had driven him from home because of his religion, called him to his 
death-bed. “Let nothing in the world tempt you to wrong your conscience,” he whis- 
pered; and one of his last acts was to send a message to the King’s brother, the Duke 
of York, begging him, in memory of an old sea-dog’s services, to protect William from 
persecution. He left his son a debt of £16,000 to collect from Charles II. The King 
had perhaps had a degree of real affection for the admiral, for he proved scrupulous about 
this debt. But as the King was poor in money and rich only in distant lands, he bestowed 
upon old Penn’s son the region that we know as Pennsylvania.

WILLIAM PENN, 
FOUNDER OF PENNSYL- 
VANIA, 1644-1718 
Tus portrait of a handsome 
young man of twenty-two, clad 
in armor, is the familiar one 
we have of William Penn. It 
has not been authenticated. It 
is said to have been painted 
while Penn was at the Vice-regal 
court of the Duke of Ormonde 
in Ireland, where William had 
his first and only military ex- 
perience in suppressing a mutiny. 
The portrait represents an 
original likeness painted in oil 
in 1666 by an unknown artist, 
possibly Sir Peter Lely. It was, 
says Justin Winsor, one of two 
preserved at Stoke Pogis for a 
long time, and this one was 
presented in 1833 by Penn’s 
grandson, Granville Penn, to the 
Historical Society of Pennsyl- 
vania.

ADMIRAL SIR WILLIAM PENN, 
1621-70 
“Op Penn,” as the royal brothers, Charles and James, 
affectionately dubbed the father of William, was a bold 
seaman and an efficient commander. He served the Com- 
monwealth of Cromwell though suspected of being in cor- 
respondence with the Royalists. He commanded the 
expedition which captured Jamaica from the Spaniards, 
although but a few months before he had offered to carry 
the fleet over to the exiled king. Pepys called him a “mean 
fellow,” and the character has been borne out somewhat 
by the investigations of later men. Yet he was a man of 
strength, a good fighter and a man of considerable impor- 
tance in his day. It was a great sorrow to him to find the 
son of a British admiral espousing the cause of the despised 
Quakers who stood for pacificism. Apparently to his 
dying day he could not understand the mind of his son 
and he doubtless would have been amazed could he have 
known that young William’s place in history was destined 
to be greater than his own.

WILLIAM PENN HEARS THOMAS LOE PREACH 
Wi11am, when scarcely seventeen and a student at Oxford, came under the influence of two men who were 
stirring the young thought of their day — John Locke, the philosopher, and Thomas Loe, the Quaker. Penn 
heard Loe discourse on the inner light, toleration, unostentatious, silent prayer, brotherly love, and the 
criminality of war. So deep was the impression the Quaker made that young Penn became a convert. And 
conversion turned his new life permanently into new channels.

PENN’S VISION 
Wut still a student at Oxford, William heard that the Quakers were planning to found colonies on the 
Delaware in order to escape the persecutions directed against them both in England and in the American 
colonies already established. The idea fired the freedom-loving imagination of young Penn. Forty years 
later he wrote, “I had an opening of joy as to these parts in the year 1661 at Oxford.”

PENN DRIVEN FROM 
HOME 
Otp Penn, more ambitious for 
his son than for himself, was 
mortified and enraged by 
William’s conversion to the 
Quaker faith. On the advice of 
his friend, Samuel Pepys, he 
sent William to the gay French 
court to cure him. But the 
cure did not last; and one day, 
in an ungovernable fury, Old 
Penn beat his son with a cane 
and turned him out of his house.

PENN’S ARREST 
On September 1, 1670, Penn was arrested in London for preaching in 
the street. It was not the first time he had been seized by the King’s 
soldiers and clapped into prison. But, as he wrote, “the Tower was the 
worst argument in the world to convince me; for whoever was in the 
wrong, those who used force for religion never could be in the right.”

prison life in writing several 
works on religion and on con- 
stitutional liberty, the most 
important being The Great 
Case of Liberty of Conscience.

had far-reaching consequences. Trial by jury had become a 
farce, for the judges enforced their verdict on the juries. But 
Penn’s spirited defense of himself inspired the jurymen to defy 
the judge and to assert their rights. The jury acquitted Penn, 
and the judge thereupon sent the jury to jail. The jury 
brought suit; the case was unanimously decided in their favor 
by twelve judges, and the former corruption of the system of 
trial by jury was at an end. 
After Penn’s release he made a missionary journey through 
Holland and Germany. At Emden he founded a Quaker 
society. Some of these Germans were later to aid him in the 
upbuilding of his great commonwealth in Pennsylvania.

brief page written to his three children. 
CHARLES II, 1630-85 
Cuartes IT had borrowed freely from Old Penn’s purse to 
outfit the navy. This debt at least, he felt, must be 
honored. Therefore, he made repayment, somewhat 
tardily, to Old Penn’s son with a tract of land in America 
and, at the same time, gave the new colony its name, 
Penn’s Woods, Latinized into Pennsylvania, in honor, 
not of William, but of Old Penn of the open purse.

PENN’S “FRAME OF GOVERNMENT” 
Penn drew up his constitution in 1681, in England, in con- 
sultation with Algernon Sydney and other noted English 
liberals. How modern was the mind of the great Quaker 
is seen in certain other ideas first formulated by him, such as 
that capital punishment should be inflicted only for murder 
and treason, and that all prisons should be places of work and 
reformation, instead of dungeons of horror. He touched 
upon the fundamentals of constitutional government when 
he said: “Liberty without obedience is confusion, and 
obedience without liberty is slavery.”

  iety of WILLIAM PENN’S LETTER TO THE INDIANS, 1681 
From London, on October 18, 1681, Penn wrote a letter to 
be presented by his commissioners to the “King or Kings of the 
Indians in Pennsylvania.” It begins: “My Freinds: There 
is one great God and Power that hath made the World and all 
things therein, to whom you and I and all People owe their 
being and well being, and to whom you and I must one 
Day give an account, ...; this great God hath written his 
law in our hearts, by which we are taught and Commanded to 
love and help and do good to one another, and not to do 
harme and Mischeif one unto another.” 
SUPPOSED: MEETING-HOUSE OF FRIENDS IN UPLAND (CHESTER) 
Uptanp had been settled by the 
Swedes in 1645, and it was the 
seat of the Swedish courts till 
1682, when Penn entered it as 
proprietor of Pennsylvania and 
changed its name to Chester. 
Here met the first Assembly of 
the new colony; and here, in 
the winter of 1682, or the spring 
of 1683, Penn’s “Great Law” 
was voted upon and adopted. 
The Great Law contained 
sixty-nine sections and embodied 
Penn’s Frame of Government 
and the English laws adapted 
to it.

THE LANDING OF WILLIAM 
PENN, OCTOBER, 1682 
“On how sweet is the quiet of these 
parts!” Penn exclaimed, moved by the 
beauty and peace of the autumn woods. 
He wrote home glowing accounts of the 
meadows, the forests, the rivers, and the 
bird life, of his new domain. One new law 
he made immediately: for every five acres 
cleared, one acre must remain forested. 
During this winter, shipload after shipload 
of eager families came out to the rich bot- 
tom lands of the Delaware. Fortunately, 
the sufferings and privations of Virginia 
and New England were not repeated 3 " 
in Pennsylvania, and from the very be- Se = 2

PENN IN TREATY WITH THE INDIANS, 1683 
““Havine consulted and resolved their business, the King 
ordered one of them to speak to me. He stood up, came 
to me, and in the name of the King saluted me, then took 
me by the hand. . . . I have never seen more natural 
sagacity, considering them without the help (I was going 
to say the spoil) of tradition; and he will deserve the 
name of wise who outwits them in any treaty about a 
thing they understand. ... We have agreed that in all 
differences between us, six of each side shall end the 
matter. Do not abuse them but let them have justice and 
W you win them.” — Wiut1aM Penn. 
THE PENN TREATY BELT 
Tuus belt, symbolizing faith and friendship unbreakable, 
is believed to have been presented to William Penn by 
the Leni-Lenape chiefs under an elm tree in 1683. There 
is no documentary proof of the existence of this treaty. 
Penn visited the Indians, lived with them, formed a high 
opinion of their good-will and integrity, purchased land 
from them by several treaties, and made promises to them 
which he kept. 
Like the Pilgrims, the Quakers kept faith with the 
natives, and enjoyed peace for over fifty years. Such 
records are rare in the annals of English colonization in 
America. For the most part contact between the races led

AN EARLY PENNSYLVANIA HOME 
CoLonists came to Pennsylvania more 
rapidly than houses could be built. Little 
habitations half-sunk in the hillsides served 
as temporary quarters for the people while 
farms were being laid out, crops prepared, 
and houses erected. Pastorius, the advance 
agent of the German Mennonites, was 
among those who began their New World 
career in such a humble setting.

remember not one better seated. . . . The situation is a neck

MEMORIAL TO THE FOUNDER OF 
GERMANTOWN 
Tue Quaker following in Germany was large. The im- 
mediate success of the “Holy Experiment” held out hope 
to German Protestants suffering from intolerable persecu- 
tions and economically ruined by the Thirty Years’ War. 
Germantown was founded in October, 1685, by Germans 
who had followed their agent, Franz Daniel Pastorius, to 
America. These new colonists were of many sects and from 
all classes. They were so industrious that Pastorius could 
write of them a few years later: “Our German society 
have in this place now established a lucrative trade in 
woollen and linen goods . . . besides this they have now 
purchased and hold over 30,000 acres of land.”

THE SLATE ROOF HOUSE, 1700

ously laid out for himself on the Delaware. os

Berore Penn arrived, his agents had laid out Philadelphia according to his design. “Be sure,” said he, “to 
settle the figure of the town so as that the streets hereafter may be uniform down to the water from the 
country bounds,” and, he added, “let every house be placed, if the person pleases, in the middle of its plot, 
so as to the breadth-way of it, that so there may be ground on each side for gardens, or orchards, or fields, 
that it may be a green town which will never be burnt and always wholesome.” So rapid was the growth 
of Philadelphia that it soon became more than a country town and developed quickly into the chief commer- 
cial city of colonial America,

of their vigor and industry.

Quakers from England and Wales, Presbyterians chiefly from Ulster, and Protestants of all sects from 
Germany, flocked to Pennsylvania, where all creeds were tolerated. Within the first year eighty houses 
were built in Philadelphia, and three hundred farms were laid out round the town. Brick could be made 
and stone could be cut in the neighborhood; and thus Philadelphia rose chiefly a brick city, with houses on 
London models. In 1750 Philadelphia had a population of about 20,000, and Pennsylvania contained 
150,000 inhabitants.

  CHAPTER XIII 
THE PLANTING OF MARYLAND 
ITH the colonization of Maryland, in 1634, a new form of government, 
\ \ known as the proprietary system, was introduced into America. In 1632 
Charles I granted a large territory lying north of Virginia to George Calvert, 
Lord Baltimore. Calvert desired to open in the new world a refuge for Roman Catholics, 
men of his own faith who — like the Puritans — suffered at home from interference with 
the free exercise of their religion. The new province was named Maryland in honor of 
Charles’ Catholic queen, Henrietta Maria. As Lord Proprietor, Baltimore had various 
powers: to enact laws, — which, however, must agree with the laws of England and 
be approved by a majority of the freemen of the province; to create courts and to exer- 
cise the right of pardon; to make ordinances, provided that these did not deprive men 
of life, limb or property; to make manorial grants with feudal powers to the manor lords; 
to collect taxes, to found churches, and to appoint ministers. 
From Gravesend in 1633 the Ark and the Dove set sail, bearing two Calverts “with 
very near twenty gentlemen of very good fashion,” most of whom were Catholics, and 
about “three hundred laboring men well provided in all things,” who were chiefly Protes- 
tants. At the Isle of Wight they took on two Jesuit Fathers, named White and Altham. 
By Baltimore’s instructions the ships were to take the long West Indian route and avoid 
the Virginian coast, for Virginia was already heartily protesting against the Proprietor’s 
patent. The voyagers should reach the mouth of the Potomac early in March, if no ill 
befell them on the way. 
The spirit in which Lord Baltimore planted this first Catholic colony on American 
soil is exemplified in the rule of conduct which he gave to his Catholic colonists, a rule 
the wisdom and rightness of which have not grown old with time, nor have been limited 
in application to the behavior of one sect. 
“His Lordship required his said Governor and Commissioners that in their voyage 
to Maryland they be very careful to preserve unity and peace amongst all the passengers 
on ship-board, and that they suffer no scandal nor offence to be given to any of the 
Protestants, whereby any just complaint may hereafter be made by them in Virginia 
or in England, and that, for that end, they cause all acts of Roman Catholic Religion to 
be done as privately as may be, and that they instruct all the Roman Catholics to be 
silent upon all occasions of discourse concerning matters of religion: and that the said 
Governor and Commissioners treat the Protestants with as much mildness and favor as 
justice will permit. And this to be observed at land as well as at sea.” More than tolera- 
tion, which is at best a negative state of mind, this rule called for the active exercise of 
that charity which alone neutralizes the bitter in life. It was an ideal worth laying as 
the moral corner-stone of a new colonial structure.

    THE PLANTING OF 
GEORGE CALVERT, FIRST LORD 
BALTIMORE, ca. 1580-1632 
As Secretary of State, George Calvert had been an intimate 
councilor of King James I, and heartily in accord with the 
royal policy of friendship with Spain. His services had 
been rewarded with an Irish peerage in 1625. The next 
year he declared himself a Roman Catholic. He was a 
loyal national, a devout religionist, and a man of vision 
who had been long interested in English expansion. He 
had joined the Virginia Company in 1609; and from 1620 to 
1628 had failed in his attempts to colonize Newfoundland.

BALTIMORE, ca. 1605-75 
Georce Catvert died before the charter for Maryland 
passed the seals. So the name of his son Cecilius, second 
Lord Baltimore, was inserted in the document. Opposi- 
tion from Virginia, however, made it advisable for Balti- 
more to remain in England to protect his rights, and he 
therefore appointed his brother Leonard Governor and 
Lieutenant-General of Maryland.

      A SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION OF 
TOLERATION IN MARYLAND 
Tue Act of Toleration (A Law of Maryland con- 
cerning Religion) was passed by the Maryland 
Assembly, at Baltimore’s instigation, in 1649, the 
year in which, at home, Charles I perished on the 
block, and the Puritan Commonwealth began. 
Baltimore, seeing how the tide ran, and wishing 
above all to keep Maryland, appointed William Stone, 
a Puritan, as governor, and placed three other Puri- 
tans in the council, which numbered five. The 
clause in the Act affecting freedom of conscience 
reads in part as follows: 
“And whereas the inforceing of the conscience in 
matter of Religion hath frequently fallen out to be of 
dangerous Consequence, Be it . . . ordeyned and 
enacted . . . that no person or persons whatsoever 
within this Province, . . . professing to beleive in 
Jesus Christ, 
shall from 
henceforth 
beeany waies

1629-1714 
In 1675 Cecil Calvert died, and his son Charles succeeded him. 
Charles had a troubled reign in Maryland. He protested against 
the Pennsylvania grant which gave to William Penn the mouth 
of the Delaware. The religious and political strife in England, 
which led to the expulsion of James II, and the advent of William 
and Mary, was reflected in Maryland. In 1691 Lord Baltimore’s 
governmental rights passed to the Crown, though his revenue 
from quit-rents and customs remained to him. His son, Benedict, 
became a member of the Church of England, and in 1720 his 
grandson Charles, fifth Lord Baltimore, resumed the government 
of Maryland under the Crown. :

  THE MASON AND DIXON LINE 
Tue dispute which arose between William Penn and Lord Baltimore about the borders of their colonies 
continued after the death of both parties. On May 10, 1732, an agreement was executed between the children 
of Penn and the great-grandson of the first Lord Baltimore, stipulating for a line due west from Cape Henlopen 
across the peninsula, from the center of which another line should be drawn tangent to a circle twelve miles 
from Newcastle, while a meridian from the tangent point should be continued to within fifteen miles from 
Philadelphia, whence should be traced the parallel of latitude westward that was to divide the provinces. 
Should the meridian cut a segment from the circle, the segment was to be part of Newcastle County. Attached 
to this agreement was a small map known as “Lord Baltimore’s map.” This parallel of latitude is the Mason 
and Dixon line which has become famous in history.

PHILIP JONES LAYING OUT 
BALTIMORE TOWN, 1730 
Tuer Maryland provincial legislature 
long continued the practice of di- 
recting places to be laid out as towns, 
often in locations where there was 
little to justify a village. In 1729 
this body directed seven commis- 
sioners to buy sixty acres of land on 
the north side of the Patapsco and 
lay it out in sixty equal lots as the 
town of Baltimore. Three years later 
the same body ordered the laying out 
of Jones-Town on the opposite site ‘ 
of Jones’s Falls. In 1745 the two villages were consolidated. When the Revolution broke out, Baltimore 
was one of the chief cities of 
Maryland. 
BALTIMORE IN 1752 
Tue houses and church of early 
Baltimore, the dock with the 
ship lying in the cove, the laden 
cart, the men on horseback and 
the tobacco field were all part 
of a life not essentially different 
from that of Virginia. Like the 
Old Dominion, Maryland raised 
tobacco on broad plantations. 
Wheat was a crop more common 
north than south of the Poto- 
mac, and the Maryland planters

  the eighteenth century. It was not laid out until nearly a hundred years had elapsed after the founding 
of St. Mary’s. In 1752 there were only twenty-five houses and two hundred inhabitants in Baltimore. 
But the farm lands of the in- 
terior, settled chiefly by Ger- 
mans, were now productive, and 
the sea, the one highway to 
market, like a great magnet 
pulled the products of the land 
to the water’s edge. In 1753 
or 1754, a vessel of wheat was 
loaded for Scotland. In 1754, 
according to Governor Sharpe, 
Baltimore had “the Appearance 
of the most Increasing Town in 
the Province.” 
Baltimore was made a county 
seat in 1767 and a port of entry 
in 1780. In these years Balti- 
more passed rapidly froma small 
village to an important seaport.

MASON AND DIXON BOUNDARY STONE 
Tur Mason and Dixon boundary stones were Set up at intervals 
to mark the boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland according 
to a survey, finished in 1767 by Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, 
surveyors who came from England for the purpose. It was a difficult 
and protracted task. They traced the line between the two states to a 
point 244 miles west of the Delaware, where the work was halted by 
Indians. The uncompleted line was not extended until 1783-84. The 
stones were set up, one for each mile, every fifth stone having the

CHAPTER XIV 
THE CAROLINA PROPRIETORS 
HEN Charles II returned as King of England there were men of power and 
\ | \ / influence in his realm whose support was needed to make the new monarch 
secure. Recompense for such support was only just. Hence, in 1663 
Charles drew up a charter granting territory covering five degrees of latitude south of 
Virginia — and stretching westward without limit —to “our right trusty and right 
well-beloved cousins and counsellors, Edward, Earl of Clarendon, our High Chancellor 
of England, and George, Duke of Albemarle, Master of our Horse and Captain-General 
of all our Forces, our right trusty and well-beloved William, Lord Craven, John, Lord 
Berkeley, our right trusty and well-beloved counsellor, Anthony, Lord Ashley, Chancellor 
of our Exchequer, Sir George Carteret, Knight and Baronet, Vice-Chamberlain of our 
Household, and our trusty and well-beloved’ Sir William Berkeley, Knight, and Sir 
John Colleton, Knight and Baronet.” Thus did the Proprietary of Carolina come into 
being. The first ships sailed in 1669, and in 1670 Charleston was founded. 
The Carolina enterprise was a speculative venture, the aim being to make the Caro- 
linas and the Bahamas centers of trade in semi-tropical products, such as almonds, silk 
and wine. One charter was granted in 1663 and a second in 1665. The latter was for 
the purpose of enabling the proprietors to incorporate in their colony settlements in the 
region of Albemarle Sound. The charter provided for a government under the direction 
of the proprietors with the assistance of a representative assembly. Religious toleration 
was also guaranteed. 
Before the charters were granted settlement had been begun in what is now North 
Carolina, territory which Virginia considered to be part of her domain. The Virginia 
Assembly in 1653 had granted rights on Roanoke and Choan rivers “and the branches 
thereof”’ to one Roger Green, who desired to plant a settlement in this wilderness. Hugue- 
nots, Quakers, Ulstermen, poor and hardy men of all persuasions, followed Green into 
North Carolina to grapple anew with the forest. About 1660 a party of New Englanders 
looked in at Cape Fear river mouth, but soon abandoned the place; and five years later 
Englishmen from Barbados led by John Yeamans made a temporary settlement in the 
same region. 
To the south of Carolina lay the Spanish settlements in Florida. Both Spain and 
England claimed the Carolina region. Its occupation became, therefore, a matter of 
political importance; to forestall the rival Spaniard was a patriotic duty. This argument 
weighed in the minds of the aristocratic proprietors who, at the same time, felt that the 
commercial resources of the country would fill their pockets with profit. In this they 
were doomed to disappointment. But out of their small beginnings grew ultimately two 
important commonwealths. :

EDWARD HYDE, EARL OF CLARENDON, 
1609-74 
Epwarp Hypk, afterwards first Earl of Clarendon, was the 
chief adviser of Charles I in the struggle between King and 
Parliament. He urged the King to stand by the law. 
Charles, however, could not be restrained from autocratic 
and unlawful acts. As a result, the Commonwealth put 
royal power temporarily in eclipse. Clarendon was one of 
those largely responsible for the restoration of the mon- 
archy in England in 1660 and for the hopeful and loyal 
spirit in which the people received Charles I. His signifi- 
cance in the history of America lies in the fact that he 
was one of the leading figures in the group of proprietors 
who received Carolina from the King.

WILLIAM, FIRST EARL OF CRAVEN, 
1608-97 
Craven’s loyalty to the Stuarts places him among the 
romantic Cavaliers of that troubled time between the 
accession of Charles I and the flight of James II. He had 
little capacity as a statesman, but he had a soldier’s cour- 
age and he had wealth; hence he was of much assistance 
to the royal cause. Charles II, who was in debt for 
large sums, saw a convenient solution of the difficulty by 
creating Craven an earl and a lord proprietor of Carolina. THE PAGEANT OF

Parliament he countenanced the election of 
a parliament which restored the monarchy.

Lrxe Monck, Anthony Ashley Cooper was a firm 
pillar of support to the restored monarchy. As a 
reward for his services, Charles II made Cooper 
first Lord Ashley and later Earl of Shaftesbury. 
The king also designated him a patentee of Caro- 
lina. Shaftesbury, with John Locke, took the 
leading part in the settlement and management of 
the province.

A PHILOSOPHER and student of political economy, science, and 
theology, John Locke admits that “‘from the time that I knew 
anything I found myself in a storm.” In common with Shaftes- 
bury, he felt a keen interest in the development of the colonies 
overseas. At the latter’s suggestion in 1669 he wrote the 
Fundamental Constitutions for the new Proprietary of Carolina. 
This document, built upon the theory of a feudal aristocracy, 
did not prove well adapted to primitive American conditions, 
however, and in course of time it gave place to a less artificial 
social and political organization within the colony. The Consti- 
tutions were not without their significance in Carolina history. 
They helped to foster the discontent which finally resulted in 
abolishing the proprietary rule. The feudalism of the Consti- 
tutions was out of adjustment with the needs of the colony. 562 Titte-page of A Brief Description, ete. . . . London, 1666, in the New York Public Library

Already settlers from Virginia had overflowed into Carolina and had begun to build their cabins along Albe-

hence the proprietors sought to direct emigrants to a region farther south.

BLACKBEARD, THE PIRATE 
Far from England and near the rich treasures 
of the Caribbean Sea, the sheltered coast of 
Carolina provided for many years a haven 
for the pirates. Of these marauders the most 
notorious was Captain Teach, commonly 
called Blackbeard, a figure fit to ship with 
the rogues of Treasure Island. 
A contemporary thus describes him: “His 
beard was of an extravagant length, as to 
breadth it came up to his eyes. He was 
accustomed to twist it with ribbons, and 
turn them about his ears. In time of action 
he wore a sling over his shoulders, with three 
brace of pistols hanging in holsters, like 
bandoliers, and stuck lighted matches under 
his hat which, appearing on each side of his 
face — his eyes naturally looking fierce and 
wild — made him altogether such a figure 
that imagination cannot form an idea of a 
fury from Hell to look more frightful.”

COLONEL WILLIAM RHETT 
A pasHING Cavalier and a gallant soldier, 
Colonel Rhett first won his spurs on 
American soil by driving the French out 
of Charleston harbor. A few years later 
he made successful war upon the pirates 
who infested the Carolina coast; and in 
1718 he captured the ferocious Stede 
Bonnet of Barbados, the worst terror of 
the trade route from these islands. Thus 
early in the history of this colony ap- 
peared a name that was to be heard 
again in Carolina. Rhett’s activities are 
symbolic of a state of affairs that de- 
veloped in the Carolinas in the early 
years of the eighteenth century. Defense 
against the Indians of the back country 
and the pirates of the coast became the 
responsibility of the settlers. The pro- 
prietors showed more and more plainly 
their inability to meet the situation, and 
the initiative in Carolina affairs passed 
more and more to the people who actu- 
ally lived in the region and whose lives 
and fortunes depended upon the welfare    
     of the settlement. 567 _From the miniature by Fraser (about 1840) after an original pastel portrait by Henrietta Johnson, about 1710, both in the Gibbes Art Gallery, Charleston, 8. C.

polite and live [in] a very genteel manner; the streets and houses regularly built; and ladies and gentlemen 
gay in their dress.” Though the population was dominantly English, there were French Huguenots, Scotch, 
and Scotch Irish among them, and many who had come from Barbados.

CHAPTER XV 
THE VISION.OF OGLETHORPE 
[= Proprietors of Carolina, alive to the menace of Spanish Florida, in 1717   
arranged with Sir Robert Mountgomery, a patriotic Briton, to colonize the 
region we now call Georgia. The new province was to be called the Mar- 
gravate of Azilia, and the Margrave must colonize it within three years or lose his rights. 
But Mountgomery failed to allure colonists, and Azilia never gained greater reality than 
its projected outlines on a map. In 1729 the Proprietors sold their rights to the Crown, 
and the two Carolinas became royal colonies. Still the southland between Carolina and 
Florida remained unoccupied — waiting the forceful claimant, be he English or Spanish. 
James Edward Oglethorpe, distinguished soldier, patriot, and humanitarian, took up 
the issue for England. He formed a company of some twenty associates, obtained a 
charter from George II, in whose honor he named his province, and in 1732 sailed in 
the little ship Anna, with his first group of settlers. He founded Georgia as an asylum 
for the oppressed, and here poor Protestants from the continent were offered homes and 
freedom. Debtors and other unfortunates lying in English prisons were set free through 
his influence and were allowed to start life anew in Georgia. Parliament made several 
grants of money towards this noble scheme, and wealthy philanthropists contributed 
handsomely. From Europe came persecuted Salzburgers and Moravians. Jews came, 
and Highlanders, and Italians to teach silk culture. In February, 1733, the first cabins 
of Savannah rose on Yamacraw Bluff.

AZILIA 
Lie all good promoters, Mountgomery issued a 
luring “Discourse concerning the designed estab- 
lishment of a new colony” (with a map of it as 
he saw it in his mind’s eye), to— “so dispose 
the Habitations, and Divisions of the Land, that 
not alone our Houses, but whatever we possess, 
will be enclos’d by Military Lines, impregnable 
against the Savages, and which will make our whole 
Plantation one continued Fortress.” The colonists, 
however, did not come, and Azilia ceased to exist 
elsewhere than on paper.

JAMES EDWARD OGLETHORPE, 1696-1785 
Tue portrait shows Oglethorpe in the fire of his youth. The 
stretch of years between youth and age was lived chiefly for the 
good of humanity. At eighteen, he was fighting with Prince 
Eugene against the Turks, and a year later, on Marlborough’s 
recommendation, he was made the Prince’s aide-de-camp, and as 
such he served during the siege and capture of Belgrade. In 1722 
he became member of Parliament for Haslemere and began to 
devote his energies to the relief of those unfortunates on whom 
the drastic English laws bore too heavily. It was out of these 
philanthropic efforts that the colony of Georgia was born. 573 From John Chaloner Smith, British Mezzotinto Portraits, London, 1884, from’ the portrait by Simon F. Ravenet’ (1706-74), engraved by Burford     OGLETHORPE WITH A

OcLetHOoRPE with a committee 
of Parliament revealed shocking 
evils in prison conditions. Ogle- 
thorpe advised a new settlement 
  in America where imprisoned 
debtors and other unfortunates 
might start life again, and at 
his request George II severed 
from Carolina the debatable 
ground between that colony and 
Spanish Florida. Oglethorpe 
was one of the trustees who 
should supervise the new colony 
for twenty-one years and then 
turn it over to the Crown. So 
Georgia was founded for the 
relief of human suffering. 574 From Lionel Cust, The National ui Se Ena 1901-02, after the painting, 1729,

ing, the colonists lived in ‘‘ Palmetto Bowers” which, being 
“in regular Rows looked very pretty, the Palmetto Leaves 
lying smooth and handsome, and of a good Colour.” 
Frederica was designed to be the British outpost nearest New Spain, and Oglethorpe was carrying out his 
instructions to make Georgia a fortified buffer state and to hold debatable land for England.

  THE SETTLEMENT OF EBENEZER, 1734 
In 1734 Baron von Reck and two Lutheran pastors brought over 78 Salzburgers. More came afterward. 
One of the pastors tells of the reception given them by Oglethorpe and his other colonists. Cannon and 
huzzahs welcomed them; ‘“‘a very good 
dinner was prepared for us”; the English 
clergyman took the pastors to lodge with 
him; in the morning a Jew fed all the Salz- 
burgers a breakfast of rice soup; they were 
allowed to use the English church, and all 
the Jews attended their services for the 
delight of hearing again the German tongue. 
Twenty-one miles above Savannah they 
founded Ebenezer, saying with the prophet, 
“Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.” In later 
years, however, the settlement unfortunately 
died out. 
WAR WITH SPANISH FLORIDA 
In 1739 England and Spain went to war. 
Oglethorpe led an expedition against Florida, 
captured the Spanish outposts, but failed to 
take St. Augustine. The Spanish retaliated 
by an attack on St. Simon’s Island, but they 
were beaten off. In 1740, Oglethorpe again 
descended on Florida and drove the Spaniards 
within their defenses at St. Augustine. The 
anxious Spaniards watched the English ships 
from their ramparts. But Oglethorpe with- 
drew because his forces were not sufficient 
for a successful attack on the city. n> EN he

SETTLEMENT OF THE BORDER DISPUTE BETWEEN ENGLAND AND SPAIN 
In 1742 the Spaniards landed troops before Frederica in a bold effort to take the English stronghold. Over 
a difficult terrain which at one place along the edge of a marsh required the attackers to advance in single 
file, the Spanish troops pushed forward to within two miles of the fort. Oglethorpe rushed to check the 
assault and defeated the invaders. The Spanish commander hurried up reinforcements to cover the retreat 
of his troops. They were ambushed by Oglethorpe’s men and routed. So ended the fighting. But not until 
the close of the Seven Years’ War was the border dispute between Spain and England settled. 
“The treaty of Paris [in 1763, by which Florida was ceded by Spain to England] ended the long contest 
between England and Spain over the debatable land of Georgia. But it served also to revive an old quarrel 
between Georgia and Carolina. Before the treaty was ratified the governor of South Carolina proceeded to 
grant to Carolinians large tracts of land south of the Altamaha. Governor Wright [of Georgia] protested. 
Suddenly he had become a good Spaniard. Carolina’s claim to the area on the ground of the grant to 29° 
was ridiculous, he said. . . . The home government took the Spanish view of the question — it was safe 
to do so now — and denied Carolina’s claim. . . . 
“Our story now soon ends. Two Gulf provinces, East and West Florida, were organized from England’s 
new acquisitions. East Florida was delimited on the north by the St. Mary’s River, and a line thence to 
the forks of the Apalachicola. The strip between the St. Mary’s and the Altamaha was added to Georgia. 
It was no longer Debatable Land.”— Bouron anv Ross, The Debatable Land, 1925.

  CHAPTER XVI 
PIRATES AND PLANTERS OF THE WEST INDIES 
RITISH colonial schemes were not confined to the continent of North America. 
B As the seventeenth century opened, it seemed as though the eyes of western 
Europe were fixed on the West Indies. Through the Caribbean Sea passed the 
silver galleons of Spain and no one knew what wealth might be concealed in the ring of 
islands that fringed it. The Spanish stronghold was at Espafiola, although the power 
of Spain had waned since the defeat of the Armada. English, Dutch and French slipped 
in under the lee of the Spanish base and buccaneering grew enormously. 
Piracy had long made perilous the route of the Spanish treasure fleet through the 
sheltered Bahama channel. As English, Dutch and French strengthened their grip on 
the continental seaboard, opening ports where ships could be built and overhauled and 
where markets were provided, piracy increased. Where formerly a sea captain would 
have good hunting if he cut out a straggling galleon, now a doughty pirate might have 
a fleet of ten or twenty stout fighting ships under his command. His need, therefore, 
was for neighborly harbors and convenient supply stations. Logically, the Indies pro- 
vided them. 
In the middle of the seventeenth century, the heyday of piracy, the buccaneers 
numbered several thousand. They came from all ranks of life. Some of the hauls they 
made were staggering; one of the greatest was that of the Dutchman, Piet Heyn, who 
descended at Matanzas harbor with thirty-one sails and captured the Vera Cruz fleet 
with its cargo worth fifteen million dollars. In such an atmosphere the tiny colonies on 
some of the islands were founded. 
But the British had a way of testing out the soil of the islands they visited. James- 
town was still young when British plantations appeared on Barbados and St. Kitts. 
Tobacco and sub-tropical products were raised at first but when, about 1640, sugar was 
introduced, the prosperity of buccaneering took second place to that of agriculture. 
Barbados rapidly became the colony in which, of all her brood, the mother country was 
most interested. Rich Barbados with its great plantations, its large population of whites 
and its larger population of slaves became a center of interest for commercial England. 
As the seventeenth century grew old buccaneering waned, but sugar planting grew 
in importance. Her colonies in the West Indies became a corner-stone of Britain’s 
growing commercial empire. If necessary, how much better could she afford to lose 
any one of the continental colonies than her sugar plantations: which were found on 
islands from Jamaica around the arc of the Antilles almost to South America.

THE ISLAND OF ST. LUCIA 
AMONG “LES ISLES CARIBES” 
CouumBus is thought to have discovered 
St. Lucia in 1502. It is one of the south- 
ern islands of the archipelago. English- 
men attempted to settle it in 1605 and 
again in 1638, but on both occasions were 
driven off by the Caribs. The French 
planted a colony in 1650 but the English 
refused to acquiesce to their occupation 
and a long struggle for possession ensued. 
At the Peace of Paris, 1763, the island 
was assigned to France but, during the 
American War of Independence, it was 
captured by the British and used as a 
naval base. From St. Lucia Admiral 
Rodney sailed to his victory over the 
Comte de Grasse in 1782. At the end 
of the war the island was restored to the 
French, who held it until 1803, when it 
finally went to the British. Tae CARIBE S.

Discoverep by Columbus in 1496, Trinidad remained in the hands of Spain until 1797, when it was sur- 
rendered to a British fleet sailing from Martinique. Its first capital, San José de Oruna, was burned by Sir 
Walter Raleigh in 1595. Trinidad is very rich in asphalt, oil, timber and tropical agricultural products. Its 
capital, Port of Spain, is one of the finest towns in the West Indies.

  SURRENDER OF JAMAICA TO ADMIRAL PENN 
CromweELL, who not only saw the value of England’s overseas possessions, but foresaw hazard for them 
unless the power of Spain were broken, waged war with a mighty hand. An important incident among the 
results of his policy is pictured here. Admiral William Penn went ashore from the flagship Swiftswre on 
May 9, 1655, to receive the sword tendered him in surrender by the Spanish commander. 
SIR HENRY MORGAN, THE PIRATE, ca. 1635-88 
Tue true story of this Welsh buccaneer outdoes fiction. Said to have been kidnapped in Bristol, sold in 
Barbados, Henry Morgan grew up in the harshest environment his times afforded, that of plantation 
slave-life. When about twenty he escaped to Jamaica, 
which Admiral Penn had just wrested from Spain. 
As Captain Morgan his name appears immediately on 
the records of English attacks on the Spanish islands. 
But the moral limits hedging an officer of the regular 
navy or army were not to his mind. By a series of 
daring and savage exploits he so won the hearts of the 
several thousand buccaneers in the islands that they 
made him their “Admiral.” With ten ships and five 
hundred men in 1668 he took the Spanish city Puerto 
Principe and the stronghold of Porto Bello, evacuat- 
ing the Isthmus only after the Governor of Panama 
had paid a heavy ransom. 
Three years later, having meanwhile ravaged Cuba 
and sacked Maracaibo and Gibraltar, he returned to 
the Isthmus, ascended the Chagres River and took 
Panama. Haled to England to answer for his conduct, 
he won Charles’ favor, was knighted and made lieu- 
tenant-governor of Jamaica. He used his position to 
assist and protect the buccaneers; and spent much of 
his time in mad carousals with them. 592 From Exquemelin, De Americaensche Zee-Roovers, Amsterdam, 1678

BARBADOS 
Most important of the English colonies in the West Indies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was 
Barbados, the easternmost of the Lesser Antilles. In 1605, an English ship found it uninhabited and took 
possession in the name of James I. Twenty years later a settlement was made. Since then the island has 
never passed out of British control. 
ENGLISH PLANTERS IN 
BARBADOS 
Suaar, introduced into the island in 
the middle of the seventeenth century, 
became its staple product and the 
foundation of its prosperity. Its 
inhabitants were drawn from all 
classes of the English people. At the 
time of the Civil War, when Cromwell 
overthrew the King’s supporters, 
many Royalists fled to Barbados and 
took up plantations. By 1684 the 
population had grown to number 
twenty thousand whites and forty-six 
thousand slaves.

BUCCANEERS DIVIDING THE SPOILS 
No better account of a pirate raid can be found than one published by Dr. J. F. Jameson in Privateering and 
Piracy in the Colonial Period, 1923. The anonymous chronicler tells of an unsuccessful fight in a river near 
Panama between a flotilla of buccaneers and the defenders: ‘“‘Wee went into a river by the Assistance of a 
Pilott. capt. Sawlkings went ashore with about 45 men. the barkque went in as far as she could and came

THE DEATH OF BLACKBEARD 
Caprain Tracu, known as Blackbeard, was one of the most famous of the pirates. In 1716 he captured 
a large French merchantman. He christened her Queen Anne’s Revenge and converted her into a warship 
armed with some forty guns. From the coast of Virginia to the Caribbean sea Blackbeard was known for 
his robberies. Daring and intelligent, Teach made himself a scourge of the Spanish Main. His winter 
quarters were on the shore of North Carolina where barrier beaches protect the bays and harbors. 
For two years Blackbeard’s piracies continued; then the governor of Virginia sent two sloops manned 
from the Royal Navy to destroy his pirate’s nest. Lieutenant Maynard commanded the attacking forces. 
He boarded Teach’s sloop. There was a hard fight. Blackbeard died in action, shot by Maynard him- 
self. Not so fortunate were some of his contemporaries. Captain John Quelch, captured in piracy, was 
convicted and executed in Boston on June 30, 1704. An observer narrates the scene after he had mounted 
the scaffold: “The last Words he spake to One of the Ministers at his going up the Stage, were, ‘I am 
not afraid of Death, I am not afraid of the Gallows, but I am afraid of what follows; I am afraid of a 
Great God, and a Judgment to Come.’ But he afterwards seem’d to brave it out too much against that 
fear: also when on the Stage first he pulled off his Hat, and bowed to the Spectators, and not Concerned, 
nor behaving himself so much like a Dying man as some would have done. The Ministers had, in the 
Way to his Execution, much desired him to Glorify God at his Death, by bearing a due Testimony against 
the Sins that had ruined him, and for the ways of Religion which he had much neglected: yet now being 
called upon to speak what he had to say, it was but thus much; ‘Gentlemen, ’Tis but little I have to 
speak; What I have to say is this, I desire to be informed for what I am here. I am Condemned only upon 
Circumstances. I forgive all the World: So the Lord be Merciful to my Soul.’’ When Lambert was Warning 
the Spectators to beware of Bad Company, Quelch joyning, “They should also take care how they brought 
wi 999 Money into New-England, to be Hanged for it.

CHAPTER XVII 
NEW FRANCE 
. | EW FRANCE is a tragedy, complete in four acts. 
(1534-1535) First, that eager explorer, Jacques Cartier, discovers the St. 
Lawrence, climbs what he calls “le mont royal,” views from these heights of 
Montreal what is now a part of the United States; and then, returning to Quebec, the 
natural stronghold of New France, erects a scutcheoned cross to show that Church and 
State claimed lordship in this wild new virgin land. 
(1608-1635) But two generations pass away before New France is really founded 
by the undauntable Champlain, who is forced by many an adverse circumstance to leave 
her still struggling for mere existence when he dies. 
(1663-1713) The third act opens in a blaze of glory; for Louis Quatorze, “Roi 
Soleil”? and ‘Grand Monarque,” takes a personal interest in what he decides to make 
his Royal Province of New France. He sends a viceroy; also the famous veterans of 
Carignan; also the great Intendant, Talon, to supervise the settlers, who soon arrive in 
much larger numbers than before. His loyal subjects in New France extend his influence 
over the three great gulfs of St. Lawrence, Mexico, and Hudson Bay, along the two 
great rivers of the St. Lawrence and the Mississippi, and round the five Great Lakes. 
But even this third act closes under the double shadow of a France exhausted in Europe 
and driven from most of her footholds in maritime America. 
(1713-1753) Old France and New are in partial eclipse under specious Louis Quinze; 
and neglected New France falls into a decline which eventually makes her the easy prey 
of her own corrupt officials. 
(1753-1763) The fifth act begins with Washington’s march to the Ohio and ends 
with the treaty which gave New France to Britain. (Volume VI, The Winning of Freedom.) 
Why was New France a tragic failure? Because, for all her great heroic deeds, she 
lacked sea-power, man-power, government, and freedom. 
British sea-power, both mercantile and naval, mastered her in peace as well as war. 
British oversea man-power was recruited by constant streams of settlers, against which 
her own one freshet had no chance whatever, even though it has multiplied far more than 
a hundred times in far less than three hundred years. Then, France had an autocratic 
government; but never any autocrat who could really govern on the spot: hence discord, 
division, and defeat. Finally, she had no adaptive freedom, like that which her English- 
speaking rivals enjoyed as colonials or won by independence later on.

  SECTION I 
THE FIRST EXPLORER OF NEW FRANCE 
HE whole vast Gulf and River of St. Lawrence take their world-famous name 
| from the odd fact that the pious explorer Jacques Cartier happened to be 
wind-bound in quite an unimportant little bay on the North Shore, opposite 
the island of Anticosti, on St. Lawrence’s Day, the 10th of August, 1535. How the name 
that Cartier gave this anchorage was changed to Pillage Bay in after years, and how it 
was itself extended not only over all the gulf and river but likewise over the innumerable 
ranges of the oldest hills on earth, is too long and too conjectural a story for more than the 
merest mention here. 
Our pictures naturally deal with 1535, the year of Cartier’s greatest voyage, when he 
discovered Quebec, named Montreal, and, from this summit, gazed beyond the line that 
now divides the United States from Canada. But as he circumnavigated the gulf in 1534 
and came out for the third time in 1541, these first and third adventurings should have 
at least a word in passing. During his first voyage to “the new country called la nouvelle 
France” he set up a Cross at Lobster Bay, on the Canadian Labrador, just inside the 
Straits of Belle Isle, and claimed the country for his king; though he found it “dry and 
half dead” and thought it must have been the land reserved for Cain. Making south 
he found Bird Rocks so thick with gannets and great auks that he could have loaded 
thirty boats with them within a single hour. Brion Island had “beasts as big as oxen, 
tusked like elephants, and living in the sea”; but it also had “peas as fine as those in 
Brittany, currants, strawberries, roses, grapes, sweet flowers, and sweet grass.” On 
the New Brunswick coast he traded with Micmacs, who, to get a few trinkets, gave all 
their furs and other clothing, ‘‘so that they had to go naked.” Luckily for them it was 
such a hot summer that Cartier called the neighboring arm of the sea le Golfe de la Chaleur. 
In Gaspé Bay he erected a Cross thirty feet high and bearing the loyal inscription Lone 
Live tue Kine or Francn! Then, in mid-August, he sailed home to St. Malo. 
His third voyage in 1541 was an utter failure. He went out to found a colony for 
Roberval, whom Francis I had made Viceroy of a very nebulous New France. As all 
but one of the Indians whom Cartier had taken home five years before had died in 
France their friends at Quebec were naturally hostile. After a miserable winter at 
Cap Rouge, a few miles above Quebec, he sailed in search of Roberval, whom he met in 
Newfoundland. He then went home, while Roberval went on to an even worse winter 
at Cap Rouge. As the jails had provided most of the colonists, Roberval had a good deal 
of flogging, hanging, and shooting to do before returning home with the survivors in 
1543.

NEW FRANCE 287 
JACQUES CARTIER, 1491-1557 
On an April day in 1534 the people of the 
French coast village of St. Malo saw two 
ships manned by some sixty-one men and com- 
manded by their townsman Jacques Cartier 
put out to sea and turn westward. Many a 
fisherman from St. Malo knew the route 
across the Atlantic. For years now the 
French fishing boats as well as some from 
England and Portugal had been crossing the 
ocean to the Newfoundland banks to spend 
the summer catching and curing cod. But 
Cartier was not bound on a fishing expedi- 
tion. His orders were to seek out that north- 
west passage to the Orient which, so thought 
the best geographers of the day, existed 
somewhere in America. He must have been a 
good commander; and we know, from an entry 
concerning a baptismal party, that he was a 
“jolly good fellow” too; Jacques Cartier et 
autres bons biberons. He was forty-four at 
the time of his famous second voyage; and 
splendidly fit in body and mind. How fit 
he was as a hydrographer any modern sailor 
can see for himself today by comparing the 
notes made in 1535 with the latest edition

THE CARTIER MEDALLION 
Tue wooden medallion of Jacques 
Cartier, dated 1704, is a large circular 
shield about 20 inches in diameter 
which was originally nailed to the 
stern of the ship, Jacques Cartier, out 
of St. Malo. This ship, probably an 
old square-sterned schooner, is thought 
to have gone down in a storm in Gaspé 
HS Bay, for on these shores the shield was 
picked up by a fisherman whose de- 
scendants finally used the souvenir as 
a window-stop and sealed it up in the 
walls of their house. The house was 
torn down in 1909 and this portrait, 
thought to be the earliest extant repre- 
sentation of Cartier, was again brought 
to light. A full account of the discovery 
of the medallion is given in J. M. 
Clarke’s The Heart of Gaspé.

JACQUES CARTIER’S THREE VOYAGES, 1534-42 
Tux first voyage took Cartier past the bluff western shore of Newfoundland. He made a circuit of the great 
estuary, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, catching sight of the broad river which entered it from the west. The 
next year he came out to determine whether this river was not in truth the passage to the Orient, sailed up 
it as far as the present site of Montreal and proved that the northwest passage did not lie there. When, in 
1541, Cartier was again sent by the French King, it was to participate in a colonizing rather than an explor- 
ing enterprise. Yet Cartier did not miss the opportunity to make his way above Hochelaga for further study 
of the great river which he had been the first to enter.   
  CARTIER ERECTS A CROSS IN 1534 
“On Friday the 24th of July, 1534, we had a cross made, thirty feet high, which was put together in the 
presence of a number of Indians on the point at the entrance to this harbor.” [That is, on what is called 
the Peninsula, opposite Sandy Beach Point, at the entrance to Gaspé Harbor, Province of Quebec, Canada, 
just south of latitude 49° and west 
of longitude 64°, on the western 
side of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.] 
“Under the cross-bar we fixed a 
shield with three fleurs-de-lis in 
relief, and above this a wooden 
inscription, engraved in large Gothic 
characters: Lone Live THE Kinc oF 
France! When the cross had been 
raised we all knelt down, with our 
hands joined, worshipping it before 
the Indians. We then made signs to 
them, looking up and pointing to 
Heaven, to show them that it was 
by means of the Cross that we had 
gained our redemption. The Indians 
displayed many signs of admiration, 
constantly turning and gazing at the 
Cross.”’ — Translated from the new 
variorum edition of Jacques Cartier’s 
works, H. P. Biggar, editor. <a Bs i mi #

Toucuine, now here, now there, Cartier worked 
his way along the shores of the Gulf of St. Law- 
rence and up the mighty river of this name. 
He stopped at the Indian village of Stadacona, 
between the rock of Quebec and the river 
St. Charles, where he was well received by 
Donnacona, the Chief of Canada, a name then 
confined to the district of Quebec. Beaching 
two of his ships he pushed on upstream in the 
smallest to the Indian village of Hochelaga, 
where Montreal now stands. A thousand 
or more Indians — men, women, and children, 
— received the forty Frenchmen with songs and 
dances and endless shouts of welcome. They 
brought their chief and all their sick or 
maimed to be healed by the mere touch of 
Cartier’s magic hand. But, true to his faith, 
Cartier opened his Testament and, in clear and 
solemn tones, read to the awestruck savages the 
opening verses of the Gospel of St. John: In 
principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud 
Deum et Deus erat Verbum. “In the beginning 
was the Word, and the Word was with God, 
and the Word was God.”

CARTIER FIRST TO SEE 
THE UNITED STATES FROM 
CANADA, OCTOBER, 1535 
From his ‘Royal Mount” of 
Montreal, on a still, autumnal after- 
noon, Jacques Cartier gazed with 
rapture from where he “had view 
for more than thirty leagues all 
round” of mountains, north and 
south, and “between the southern 
hills, of country which is the loveli- 
est that a man could see.” No won- 
der; for he saw that wide magnifi- 
cence of hill and plain, brightened by 
the long sheen of the St. Lawrence, 
just when the forest was aglow, as 
if a sunset glory shone the livelong 
day within the crimson of the maple 
leaves. But there was a terrible win- 
ter at Stadacona, whither Cartier 
returned. The Indians became hostile 
and scurvy broke out. One third of 
Cartier’s little band died, the first 
Frenchmen to mingle their dust with 
the soil of Canada. In May, the 
party was glad to sail for home, 
leaving their cross of annexation:

(1535). Hochelaga, says Cartier, 
was strongly fortified with three 
palisades, which had platforms 
from which the garrison could 
hurl stones on attackers. The 
houses were “finely and cunningly 
built”: each of the fifty was 
about fifty paces long by twelve 
wide. There were splendid crops 
of corn all round. (Ramusio’s

  SECTION II 
THE FOUNDERS OF NEW FRANCE, 1600-1663 
OR a hundred and fifty years — from Jacques Cartier to La Salle — the greatly 
F expanding area claimed by the French was thought to contain the shortest sea 
route to all the Indies and Cathay. But meanwhile the mines the Spaniards 
found in plenty farther south had set men searching for others in the north; and the 
lure of this northern Eldorado lasted as long as New France. 
Failing the ready riches of the East, and failing any minable riches within its own 
domain, New France always relied upon fur. Fur was the next best thing to silver, gold, 
and jewels, because it was easily transported, found a ready market, and yielded enormous 
profits, owing to the ease with which the Indians could be cheated out of even the best 
pelts for the cheapest gewgaws, especially when plied with liquor first. Of course the 
English, Dutch, and other whites also cheated and debauched the Indians just as freely 
as the French did, besides being far less friendly, as a rule. And of course, in justice to’ 
the whites, it ought to be remembered that Indians valued gewgaws almost as much as 
whites valued furs. But the seamy side remains. 
After treasure, trade; and after trade — and a long way after trade — came the 
founding of the real colony which resulted in La Nouvelle France of the old régime and 
the French-Canadians of the new. It is the peculiar glory of Champlain that he never, 
to his dying day, lost sight of settlement as the only firm foundation on which to build 
New France. His means were pitifully small, and the struggle for mere existence was 
intensely hard. But nearly all the settlers of this earliest time were Normans, akin, 
at least in part, to that magnificent race which changed the so-called “Anglo-Saxon” 
iron into steel and won the strenuous leadership in other lands, all over seaboard Europe. 
The search for treasure, the business of trade, and the inrooting work of real settle- 
ment, all required the intervention of the State. But the insistent call of home affairs 
prevented the far-off, feeble voice of New France from being effectively heard at court 
(except, for once, by Richelieu) till this dire period closed. Yet in the very midst of it 
the Church won by far the greatest of all her glories in New France.

TADOUSAC: FIRST ATTEMPT AT A TRADING-POST IN NEW FRANCE, 1600 
Ar Tadousac, half way between the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the site of Quebec, the French planted their 
first trading-post in 1600. Pierre Chauvin of Honfleur was given the monopoly of the Laurentian fur trade 
for ten years on condition that he took out fifty colonists each year. But like most exploiters, he cared a 
great deal for the fur trade and little 
for colonization. 
The numbers show depths in 
fathoms. Most of the letters explain 
themselves, especially when referring 
to natural features: F, however, 
deserves particular mention as “The 
Point of all the Devils,” which it 
certainly is if you drag your anchor 
down-hill in the Bay (B) and fetch 
up on the Devil’s own rocks. D is 
where the Indians camped; C where 
Chauvin landed his sixteen wretched 
“colonists.” In three years Chauvin 
lost his monopoly because he failed 
in the vital matter of colonization. 
The honor of founding New France 
passed to another. 
    
FISH AND FUR 
Fisu and fur were the staple products of 
pokey “4 northern North America all through the 
seventeenth century. The French fished 
‘ off Grand Banks and round the Gulf of 
St. Lawrence. Everybody “‘furred,” that 
is, everybody who got the chance to do so.

devoted to the Catholic faith and King Henry of Navarre, with 
an inborn love of the sea, which he put to fine use as a captain 
in the French navy and an explorer of New France. But it 
is as the real founder of Quebec and New France in 1608 that 611 _ From the Ducornet engraying of Champlain 
he is numbered among the immortals. And it is because he De are ee on

In 1603 Champlain was again in America, this time in the 
region which was to be the center of his thoughts and plans to 
the end of his life. He came out with a trading expedition and 
went up the St. Lawrence as far as Hochelaga, which the 
French found in ruined desolation as the result of Indian war.

DE MONTS IN ACADIA, 1604-07 
Upon his return from the St. Lawrence, Champlain joined company 
with a Huguenot nobleman, De Monts by name, who had secured 
from the king the first Acadian grant of the usual fur monopoly 
on condition of establishing a hundred settlers every year. De 
Monts became the head of a large company with a grant which 
included everything from Cape Breton to beyond New York. In 
1604 he came out and established his settlement in Passamaquoddy 
Bay. Champlain was with him as geographer of the expedition. 
No authentic portrait of De Monts is known. B. P. Poore was 
commissioned by the governor of Massachusetts to copy documents 
in the French archives. No original for the De Monts portrait has 
ever been found.

Acadia had been hoisted on the 25th of 
June, yet, when the searching cold, com-

prisonment and scurvy followed fast. Nearly half the wretched colonists died before spring let the enfeebled 
survivors crawl out.

     LESCARBOT’S PORT ROYAL, 1606-07 
Amone the boatload of adventurers who came out to the little post of Port Royal in the summer of 1606 
was Marc Lescarbot, a literary lawyer who would have made a splendid special correspondent for the 
Parisian press, had such men been invented then. Lescarbot in his Histoire de la Nouvelle France, 1609, told 
the story of Port Royal with all its alluring touches. Therefore he, and not Champlain, who gives little 
more than information, shall tell us of “The Order 
of Good Cheer” which Champlain proposed. 
THE ORDER OF GOOD CHEER 
“Each man was appointed chief steward in his turn. 
No one, two days before his turn, failed to hunt and 
fish for delicious fare. The chief steward, whom the 
Indians called Atoctegic, marched in at evening 
dinner, napkin on shoulder, wand of office in his 
hand, around his neck the Order’s collar; then, after 
him, every single member of the Order of Good Cheer, 
each with his appropriate dish. At night, before 
giving God due thanks, the steward handed the 
collar to his successor, each then drinking to the 
other. We had abundance of game, such as duck, 
bustard, partridges, and geese; also moose, caribou, 
bear, and rabbits, whereof we made dishes better 
than those of the famous Rue aux Ours in Paris; 
for of all meats what can be tenderer than the best 
moose, or more toothsome than good beaver tail?” 
But in France the Basques and Bretons were 
clamoring that they were being ruined because of the 
privileges of De Monts’ company. His patent was 
revoked and Champlain brought the discouraged

Tuts was the first map after Champlain had founded New France in 1608 at Quebec. Tadousac, Hochelaga, 
and Stadacona all appear. Many of the names attached to the natural features are still in use, while others 
have been dropped. “Canada” was then applied to but a limited country around Quebec. 
CHAMPLAIN’S DON DE DIEU, 1608 
In 1608 Champlain was again in American waters for De Monts, whom he had persuaded to abandon 
Acadia for the St. Lawrence country. Champlain’s Don de Dieu was somewhat like a barque; though 
she carried a little square sail under her bowsprit and had no jibs, while her spanker was very lateenish. 
Her mainsail had good hoist and spread. 
She carried six sails on her three pole masts, 
and the tallest mast was 73 feet from step to 
truck. She had stone ballast, a rope-tackle 
tiller, and three cabins on the poop. She | 
measured about 100 tons.

CHAMPLAIN’S CONFERENCE WITH THE INDIAN CHIEFS 
Tit the first French regulars arrived in 1665, Indian affairs were often matters of immediate life or death. 
The whites came out not only to a distant land but to a very much more distant age. It was as if the hand 
of time had been put back thousands of years, to an age when all our own ancestors were quite as wild and 
savage. This vast difference of course produced endless clashings; and, equally of course, the stronger 
whites took the usual advantage of the weaker reds. On the other hand, America could never have become 
civilized in so few centuries unless whites had mastered reds. Yet there were differences between the various 
whites, mostly to the advantage of the French. The Spaniards often treated Indians as their prey. The 
Dutch and English used them as they could for trade; but put them quite outside the pale in other ways. 
The French, with all their faults, were both more human and humane.

CHAMPLAIN FIGHTS THE 
IROQUOIS, 1609 
In the spring of 1609 Champlain with 
two companions joined a war party 
of his Algonquin friends. He dis- 
covered the lake which bears his 
name and, near the present site of 
Ticonderoga, met the redoubtable 
Iroquois. Champlain has left an 
account of the fight. Both sides 
spent the night in warlike song and 
dance and in loud defiance of each 
other. The Algonquins carefully hid 
the three Frenchmen from the Iro- 
quois till they marched to battle, 
led by Champlain, while his two companions still remained hidden on the flank. Champlain’s words are: 
“When I was within twenty paces the enemy, halting, gazed at me; as I also gazed at them. When I saw 
them move to shoot I drew a bead on one of the three chiefs. I had loaded with four bullets and hit three 
men at the first discharge, killing two on the spot. When our Indians saw this they roared so loudly that 
you could not have heard it thunder. Then arrows flew like hail on both sides. But when my companions 
fired from the woods the Iroquois, seeing their chiefs killed, turned tail and fled.”

In 1613 Champlain went up the Ottawa to confirm a story he had heard from a Frenchman who had been 
living with the Indians, that by this way a water route lay to the sea. He did not find the ocean; but learned 
that the Indians of the country wished for nothing so much as his aid against the Iroquois. Two years later, 
in the summer of 1615, he joined a great war party, which adventure brought him to the shores of Lake 
Huron, where he was the first of all the whites to gaze upon those vast fresh-water seas that have assumed 
the name Great Lakes by the sheer force of natural right.

CHAMPLAIN’S SECOND BATTLE 
WITH THE IROQUOIS, 1615 
Tuis fight was brought on by the Indian 
interference with the fur trade. The 
Iroquois (or Onondaga) fort lay beside 
a pond a few miles south of Lake Oneida, 
The Hurons yelled like fiends, but be- 
haved like a mob. Everything went 
wrong; and Champlain’s Frenchmen 
could do nothing effective alone. 
Champlain was wounded twice, “and 
suffered Gehenna while being carried 
bound and pinioned on the back of one 
of our savages.” The defeated French 
and Indians took the long route back to 
Lake Huron. Then Champlain returned 
overland to Quebec.

CHAMPLAIN THE FATHER OF NEW FRANCE, 
1608-1635 
In his work on Navigation Champlain says that “A good cap- 
tain must be hardy and active and prove himself untiring at 
his work, so that whatever happens, he may be able to appear 
on deck and issue orders to his crew. Occasionally he should 
not disdain to lend a hand himself. . . . Prayers should be 
said night and morning, and the routine carried out in an 
orderly way. A captain should be ae ce affable, But per- 
emptory in his orders. 2 a 
He must make sure 
that every man of 
each watch is doing 
his duty. . . . Should 
an accident happen 
the captain must give 
proof of manly 
courage, issue orders 
in a calm voice, and 
make light of facing |. 
even death.” Champlain, compelled to surrender Quebec to an | 
English expedition (1629) returned to his post when Canada was 
restored to France. Here he died in his sixty-ninth year, still 
the Captain of New France.      628 The Champlain statue by Paul Chevré (1898-), at Quebec

SrrancE to say, the first real habitant farmer was not a Norman | _ 
peasant but a Parisian druggist, Louis Hébert, whose farm on 
the heights of Quebec was a constant joy to Champlain and the 
first missionaries, the Récollets, who had arrived two years 
before him, Hébert having landed at Quebec in 1617, the Récollets | 
in 1615. Hébert heard the call of the soil with an enthusiasm =

THE FIRST SEIGNEUR, 1635 
Ropert Girrarp had often come out as a 
ship’s doctor and enjoyed great sport be- 
tween Quebec and Beauport at a place still 
called La Canardiére, from the duck-blind 
he built there. Now he was to be Seigneur 
de Beauport and settle his censitaires along 
that Céte de Beaupré (or Shore of the 
Beautiful Meadows) which bounds the 
North Channel just belcw Quebec. The 
French were accustomed to the seigniorial 
system at home; and, when properly applied 
to settlement in Canada, it worked very 
well and was fairly popular too. The 
seigneur held his lands in trust from the 
king, as his censitatres held theirs from him. 
He was the local immigration agent, the 
unpaid magistrate, the miller, and every- 
thing else that the curé, notary, and captain 
of militia were not; and he had to work 
hard to succeed. His milling rights often 
cost more than they were worth; for he 
had to build, repair, and run the ‘mill, while 
getting only one bushel to every baker’s 
dozen the farmer took away. His hunting 
and fishing rights were worth next to 
nothing, where people were few, the country 
vast, game plentiful, and wardens not to be had. As for scigniorial rents, they were often so small as not 
to be worth collecting except from the bigger censitaires. St. Martin’s Day, November 11 (now best known 
from the Armistice of the Great World War) was rent day at the manor, where the seigneur kept such open 
house that many a censitaire got more in hospitality than he ever gave in rent. The seigneur’s position, 
however, was an honorable one, often sought after by money-making upstarts; while home farms and 
“furring” might add a good deal to the very modest seigniorial income itself. 
Alas that Champlain was not the governor to whom the first Canadian seigneur bent the knee! Champlain 
died on Christmas Day in 1635; and Giffard did homage on the following New Year’s Eve, in the little 
Chateau St. Louis, to Monsieur de Bras de Fer, le Sieur du Chasteaufort, who was Champlain’s lieutenant. 
“He of the Iron Arm, the Lord of Castle Strong” received the homage, invested Giffard with both sword and 
spur, and sent him forth as Lord of Beauport, ready to fight all enemies of France.

          CARDINAL RICHELIEU, 1585-1642 
RicHELIEU set out to unify France at home, 
make her the first Great Power in Europe, 
and win an empire overseas. Fostering 
French sea-power, and turning his spare 
attention to New France, he formed the 
Company of the Hundred Associates, which 
received in perpetuity a complete monopoly 
of “furring” rights, besides the control of 
all other trade for sixteen years, and dominion 
over North America from Florida to Labrador 
and from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the 
great fresh-water seas discovered by Cham- 
plain. But Richelieu’s attention was dis- 
tracted nearer home; the Company failed 
to colonize New France; and when its char- 
ter -was revoked in 1663 the entire white 
population was less than three thousand 633 From the portrait by Philippe de Champaigne (1602-74), in the National j Portrait Gallery, London souls. 
  “FURRING” INDIANS GOING HOME 
Or course the new company was ravenous for furs; and Quebec was keenly delighted when, in Champlain’s 
last years, six hundred Huron braves arrived in a hundred and forty bark canoes all loaded down with pelts. 
The Indians drank and traded, danced, feasted, held a great pow-wow, and smoked the pipe of peace. Then, 
on the rising tide, the lightened birchbarks went gliding up-stream. So began the custom which developed 
into one of the most picturesque features of the life of New France. In later times each summer, except 
when some extraordinary circumstance pre- 
vented, a great fleet of Indian canoes from 
the interior of the continent paddled down 
to the French settlements along the St. 
Lawrence.

  RECOLLETS AND JESUITS, 1625 
TEN years of mission work convinced the devoted Récollets 
that a richer, stronger, and better supported order than 
their own was needed in New France. So they welcomed the 
equally devoted but much more powerful Jesuits. These 
came year after year, directed by an organization marked 
by its zeal and fine intelligence. Singly and in pairs they 
went among the Indians in the service of their country and 
their God. All too often their fate was martyrdom with 
little glory. But they persisted; and their achievement ne 
also persists in the history of the land they served. SEE a Promisnsinaliting oe ng cmenteiseay Coane by,

FATHER LE JEUNE AND THE JESUIT RELATIONS 
Tue Jesuits had a fair field and much favor; for Huguenots 
and foreigners were forbidden after 1632. Fearless and tire- 
less, the vanguard of the Lord of Hosts, the Jesuits could also 
write; and for their own time and place and people the Jesuit 
Relations were the best possible propagandist letters from the 
front. Father Le Jeune was one of the first three to arrive in 
1625 and wrote a most appealing Relation. He likewise was 
the preacher at the funeral of Champlain.

ARRIVAL OF THE URSULINES, 1639 
Tue Ursulines are a teaching order; the Hospitaliéres are nurses. 
They both came to Quebec four years after Champlain’s death. 
The central figure is that of La Mére Marie de |’Incarnation, 
first Superior of the Quebec Ursulines and the greatest woman 
of New France, dauntless and pertinacious as Champlain, a 
saintly leader, devoted teacher of both red and white, and ardent 
advocate of colonization. The Hospitaliéres, within their 
own sphere, were equally devoted to the service of both God and 
man. These self-sacrificing women, who came to care for the 
young and the infirm, brought gifts of love and service that only 
those who lived in a primitive frontier-post far from the land and 
scenes of their childhood could appreciate.

OLD URSULINE CONVENT,

Here La Mére Marie de l’Incar- 
nation used to teach the little 
Indian girls without trying to 
force premature “civilization” 
upon them. “They must see the 
woods. Loss of liberty makes 
them sad, and sadness makes 
them sick. We have not ‘civil- 
ized’ one in a hundred.” Other 
classes were filled with the French 
girls of Quebec and the surround- 
ing country. But teaching was 
not the only occupation. When- 
ever fire, sword, or pestilence 
swept through Quebec the Ursu- 
lines nobly did their duty. They 
have been through two fires and 
four sieges, besides nursing the 
sick and wounded of five battles 
and many a pestilential scourge.

if every tree were an Iroquois he still would go. With forty-two companions,

TROQUOIS MASSACRES OF

1648-49 
Ir was the first historic 4th of 
July in this New World, a 
Fourth as terrible to little, lost 
Huronia as the other Fourth 
is glorious to millions beneath 
the Stars and Stripes. Good 
Father Daniel had just pro- 
nounced the last words of the 
mass, Ita missa est, when sudden 
shrieks of Iroquois! Iroquois!! 
Troquois!!! pierced the summer 
air. Stormers were hacking at 
the palisade and bullets were 
whistling in, when Daniel, paus- 
ing one sacred moment to bless 
his congregation, stepped forth unflinchingly, and, for another moment, awed even the Iroquois. Then, 
with fiendish yells, they cut him down and threw his body into his own flaming chapel. 
Next year Brébceuf and Gabriel Lalemant were the foremost martyrs. This time the Iroquois were deter- 
mined to slake their fury to the full; and even they must have been satisfied with keeping the gentle Lalemant 
under torture for fourteen agonizing hours. Bréboeuf, a giant in stature and in strength, who used to carry 
Lalemant’s loads across the portages, was racked with the most excruciating pains that they could think of. 
They poured boiling water on his head, to show their contempt for baptism. They hung a necklace of red- 
hot axe-heads round his naked shoulders. They girdled him with belts of fire. But never a word of anger 
or one cry of anguish could they wring from him. At last a furious war chief cut out his dauntless heart. (The 
picture is a composite showing the different forms of martyrdom suffered by many Jesuits at different times.)

For ten long nights and days the Iroquois raged round the tiny fort, where Dollard’s men nearly died of 
thirst, after their one path to the river had been closed. Then all his Indians except the two chiefs and 
five of their followers deserted; whereupon seven hundred Iroquois advanced against the garrison of only 
twenty-three. Like one long living palisade, the enemy came on. The French muskets cut lanes of death 
through the attackers. But, like a storm-blown wave, the furious assault burst on the little fort and breached 
it. Anohotaha fell, 
mortally wounded, call- 
ing out with his last 
breath, “Lay my head 
on the fire; the Iroquois 
must never get my 
scalp.” 
Then Dollard’s mus- 
ketoon (loaded like a 
bomb, to hurl among 
the enemy) burst among 
the French, who were 
quickly hacked to death.

like these could not be

LOUIS XIV, KING OF NEW FRANCE, 1638-1715 
Wuatever his faults, neglect of New France was never among them. For more than fifty years he read all 
the Canadian dispatches; and to the present they still remain, with all his marginal notes. Nor was he 
lacking in ability. Moreover, Colbert was an almost ideal minister to direct colonial affairs from the home 
office. But an enfant colony three thousand miles away could never be an integral province of France; nor 
could it thrive if autocrat and bureaucrat combined to make it so. 
Hard things were often said of Louis XIV; and that he rightly deserved some of them cannot be denied. 
But he was a worker, and a very hard worker too. The trouble was that he tried to do what no one man 
could do successfully, and that he extended the system of unification, needed in certain ways in France, to 
a country thousands of miles away at a time when months were required to exchange reports, ideas, and 
orders. He nearly made his bad colonial system work. But when the balance of sea-power turned against 
him New France was doomed.

   SECTION III 
THE AGE OF SETTLEMENT, 1663-1773 
N spite of heroes like Dollard and Brébceuf, in spite of founders like Champlain and 
I Maisonneuve, in spite of the most devoted bishop, priests, and nuns, of habitants 
like Louis Hébert and seigneurs like Giffard, in spite of explorers like Nicolet and 
Radisson; and, strange as it may seem, in spite of the fact that France was not only 
the greatest power in Europe, most peopled and best armed, but rapidly rising to still 
greater heights; in spite of all this, it seemed as if New France was doomed. The wonder 
is how the stunted, starveling colony ever survived the terrible three years that began 
with Dollard’s death in 1660. The company of the Hundred Associates (officially “of 
New France”) was going to its ruin after a mixture of reckless exploitation, gross abuses, 
and the utmost possible evasion of all its duties, especially those of colonization. Less 
than three thousand French throughout America! Why, more than three thousand 
English had come out to Massachusetts alone, within a single year; and Virginia now 
had ten times the whites of New France! Moreover, the tide of Iroquois invasion had 
not been turned but only held back at one point and for a single season. Iroquois were 
killing Algonquins within a mile of where the new French governor was landing at Quebec 
in 1656. Even the Ursuline convent had to be garrisoned, and the nuns told off to regular 
siege duties — La Mére Marie taking the most dangerous one of all. Then, when the 
Iroquois receded, pestilence came in and proved worse than any massacre. Then came 
the earthquake year of 1663, when even the very hills seemed doomed. But the Church 
stood fast, heroically fast; and Laval actually chose this earthquake year to found the 
university which still bears his famous name. Yet from an agonizing people the cry of 
“Back to France!” went piteously forth. 
The darkest hour, however, did, for once, precede the dawn. Every ship next year 
brought word of what great things the king would do, now that he was making his 
Canadian domain a Royal Province of glorious France herself. Then, in 1665, the royal 
might and glory were made manifest in this new, exultant province, which now received, 
besides a governor, a real viceroy, a regiment of veterans, fresh from a most victorious 
campaign, a king’s intendant to manage the great prospective settlement, and, most 
significant of all, a goodly number of real settlers from different walks of life. Yes, 
the golden age had come; and for a generation its soaring spirit filled New France. 
Indian and English enemies were driven back; while eager French explorers went north 
and west and south, across the three great gulfs, along the two great rivers, and around 
the five Great Lakes, everywhere proclaiming the king of France to be the king of all 
unoccupied America! 
When the era of expansion had passed, French claims extended northward to 
Hudson Bay, westward from the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and southward to the Gulf of 
Mexico. ‘The interior of the continent was French. But, east of the Appalachians, 
the chain of English colonies grew in wealth and population; while here and there along 
the frontier the French and English clashed.

NEW FRANCE 311 
THE MOTHERS OF 
NEW FRANCE, 1665-1672 
No wives, no settlements; no 
settlements, no future for New 
France. Now, there were five 
bachelors to every one un- 
married girl. So Talon asked 
the king and Colbert for an 
immediate shipment of prospec- 
tive brides; and out came the 
first consignment of the Filles du 
Roy, chosen from the Royal 
Orphanage of Paris. There was 
tremendous competition for the 
prettiest and sturdiest; but 
some others were left over, in 
spite of the taxes and penalties enforced against bachelors and spinsters and even their unhappy parents 
too; also in spite of the bonus paid in cash and kind to every mated couple. Some wives proving too weak 
for the strenuous settlement life, Talon asked for Norman peasants; and several consignments of this kind 
— the very fittest of the fit — came out, with the encouraging result that every single one was wed. Then 
well-educated girls, suitable for officers’ wives, were sent for, duly received, and quickly married off. But 
the first consignment was four short; fifteen were sent in rectification; and eleven were left lamenting. This 
was no fault of Talon’s, for he was an excellent master of the matrimonial market when he got his own way. 
Moreover, the population trebled during his seven years in Canada; and half of this increase was due to the 
birth-rate. Up and down the St. Lawrence the habitant farms multiplied. About each habitant cottage 
played a brood of sturdy children. 
What this birth-rate has been persistently, from his day to our own, may be imagined from these two very 
telling facts: first, that the three million French-Canadians in North America today are nearly all descended 
from less than thirty thousand French immigrants, most of whom came out under Talon’s supervision; and 
secondly, that when the Quebec Provincial Government used to give a free hundred acres to fathers of twelve 
living children, it not infrequently received petitions from fathers who thought themselves entitled to double 
this acreage, because they had twenty-four children or more. Think of the following might-have-been. 
Had Talon’s advice been taken, and at least one per cent (no more than that) of France’s population come to 
Canada, then, at the rate which has actually been realized, there would be not three but twenty million 
people of French descent in the United States and Canada today. 
Far more significant still is the fact that if immigrants had come out from France in the same proportion 
as they came from the old home folk of England, and if they had increased in the same proportion as the 
French-Canadians, then the French-Canadians of today would vastly outnumber the present population 
of the whole New World.

CHARLES LE MOYNE, BARON DE 
LONGUEUIL, 1625-85 
Lz Moyne, whose Canadian barony survives to the 
present day, was a glorious specimen of the seigneurs of 
New France. Tall, immensely strong, and very hand- 
some, equally at home with red men or white, kind 
of heart yet keen of mind, and born to lead in either 
peace or war, he was exactly the sort of supremely fit 
Norman whom William the Conqueror would have 
delighted in. Fitter still, he married the belle of 
Montreal, whose brains well matched her beauty. 
Fittest of all, she bore him eleven sons, each one of 
whom was also well equipped both in body and in 
mind. All lived to reach high and well won rank in 
the army, navy, or administration, or died on active 
service at the front. Bienville, the ninth son, was the 
founder and first governor of Louisiana; while Iberville, 
the third, was no less an historic character than the 
great French hero of the three great gulfs — St. 
Lawrence, Mexico, and Hudson Bay.

to be, and more than most as well; for few of other lands have ever

The habitante had to manage not only a most prolific household 
but one that was forced to be greatly self-supplying too, She had 
to weave and spin and bake, and do unnumbered odd jobs unknown 
to her descendants. Yet some old ways persist. And even now 
families of over a dozen are not at all uncommon.

THE SPREAD OF FRENCH INFLUENCE INLAND 
In the Mississippi Valley, as almost everywhere else, we view the struggle between the seaboard English 
and the inland French. French explorers were always first along the three great rivers St. Lawrence, Ohio, and 
Mississippi; first around the five Great Lakes; aad first far west, until they saw the Rockies. But France 
failed to keep the seaways open and to send out a sufficient number of colonists. In the seventeenth century 
the Jesuit Albanel found the English flag on shipboard in Hudson Bay. The eighteenth saw the Gulf of 
St. Lawrence closed by the British conquest of Canada. The nineteenth saw the Gulf of Mexico lost with 
Louisiana.

of the interior began to be

  vantage than in this searching 
out of the very heart of North America. Joliet’s crude map shows both the French dream and the surprising 
amount of information regarding the interior which their explorations netted. 
Joliet inscribed in the panel in the lower left corner of the original of this map, a letter to Frontenac. The 
map gives, he says, the situation of the Lakes on which there is navigation for more than 1200 leagues from 
east to west. He adds that by one of the large rivers you will find a route to the Red Sea (Mer Vermeille), 
ie. the Gulf of California, and from there to Peru, Japan, and China. (Winsor, Vol. IV, p. 209.) °

country to plant a mission among the Indians. On his way he fell ill. A year later he again made the 
attempt and this time died. His energy, hardihood, and devotion were also typical of his brother Jesuits.

had given Niagara a wide berth 
because of the savage Iroquois. 
The discovery of the Falls made 
it clear that a portage between 
Lake Ontario and Lake Erie was 
inevitable. La Salle, with deep 
insight, grasped immediately the 
commercial and military impor- 
tance of the Niagara peninsula 
as an indispensable link with 
the West. A French fort here 
would defend the route which 
fur traders and soldiers would 
follow in going to the interior 
and would establish French con- 
trol in the Great Lakes area.

: : LA SALLE SAILS THE FIRST SHIP ON THE LAKES, 
LE GRIFFON, LAKE ERIE, 1679 
La Saute, having all plans ready for his great adventuring into the 
unknown heart of North America, sent Father Hennepin ahead to 
Niagara, there to found a post and build a ship which should be 
ready to launch in the early spring of 1679. No Indian had ever 
seen, or even had imagined, so vast a white man’s winged canoe 
as the little Griffon seemed when she sailed west, trading as she 
went, till at last she anchored in Green Bay. Thence, in September, 
she sailed back, with a fortune in furs aboard. But La Salle watched 
her departure with a very anxious heart. And his foreboding was 
fulfilled; for she foundered 
with all hands.

Henri vE Tonty was a

in the wilds, he was more 
than the equal of two or- 
aT dinary men who had both 
hands. He had lost one 
hand in the European wars. He and La Salle were friends till death; 
and their two glorious names are forever joined together in the 
story of how the Mississippi was explored for France. 681 From the bronze tablet by H. A. MacNeil, in the Chicago Historical Society     80 From the painting, 1904, by Herman T.

     STARVED ROCK, WHERE LA SALLE BUILT A FORT, 1679 
Wuen the Griffon had passed from sight La Salle and Tonty, with what remained of their followers, struck 
south, into the country of the Illinois. The explorers followed the Illinois River to a point near where Peoria 
stands today. Here La Salle’s luck left him: his 
followers began to desert; and he foreboded attack 
by the Indians. Without supplies he could go no 
farther. So at Starved Rock he built a fort, called 
it Crévecceur (or Heartbreak) and, leaving Tonty 
in command, hastened back both to get supplies 
for the building of a new ship at Crévecceur and 
to learn the fate of the Griffon. He found that 
the Griffon had never been seen again. Undis- 
mayed, he secured new supplies and hurried 
westward, only to meet the staggering news that 
Tonty’s men had mutinied. Hoping against 
hope that Tonty himself had been able to hold 
out, he then pushed on, only to find Fort Heart- 
break utterly forlorn. A few months later Tonty, 
at Michilimackinac, told him the story of the 
whole disaster. But this only strengthened the 
indomitable fixed idea of being “more resolute 
than ever to continue the work and push on with 
further explorations.”

set up a column hewn from the forest,

Thus far had he brought the boundary of 
New France. The season was advancing, 
supplies were low, and it was a long paddle 
back up river. By August the party reached 
the country of the Illinois. Here La Salle

spent the winter. The next year saw La

MADELEINE DE VERCHERES, 
GIRL HEROINE OF NEW FRANCE: 1692 
Tur border seigniories which had been settled by the veterans 
of Carignan stood right in the line of Iroquois invasion; and 
after the appalling massacre of Lachine in 1689, when that 
whole settlement was blotted out by Iroquois, the very woods 
between the Richelieu and Montreal seemed ominous of doom, 
more especially because New France never had nearly enough 
men to garrison every little fort on every frontier seigniory. 
Madeleine de Verchéres, however, proved herself well able 
to hold even Iroquois at bay. 
MADELEINE AT BAY 
One brooding day in October, when Captain de Verchéres 
was on duty at Quebec, and his wife obliged to be in Montreal, 
his tiny fort at Verchéres was garrisoned by three men, two 
boys, and one girl. The eldest man was over eighty. The 
Verchéres were ten and twelve; their sister, Madeleine, four- 
teen. Suddenly, from the crimson forest came a burst of 
musketry. Then, through the smoke, came fifty yelling 
Troquois. Madeleine, true daughter of the veterans, instantly 
ran in and barred the gate, put on a soldier’s hat, took up her 
musket, armed both her brothers, and saw that they and all |_ : 
three men were properly posted at once. As quickly, she 692 statuette by Louis Philippe Hiebert, made for the, 
fired the single cannon, both to make the Iroquois think the , ‘ 
fort well defended and to warn any habitants near by. Presently a family appeared at the river landing, 
between which and the fort there was a fire-zone of a hundred yards. Madeleine ran out and shepherded 
these people in, the Iroquois not venturing to break cover under that cannon’s mouth. 
For a whole week the dauntless Madeleine kept the murderous savages at bay. The word “All’s well!” was 
duly shouted round the little fort, just as if it held a real garrison. Half the defenders were always on the 
watch; and no Iroquois could show himself without drawing fire. On the sixth day the news reached 
Montreal; and on the seventh Lieutenant de la Monnerie arrived with forty men. Madeleine, then not 
on actual guard, was dozing, with her musket on her knees, when her sentry challenged: Qui vive? 
“French: la Monnerie and forty men.” Madeleine was all alert, and ready with the regulation word: “ Ad- 
vance one, and give the countersign!”” When Monnerie complied she at once saluted, saying, “Sir, 
d I hand over my command 
to you.” Then, after he and 
she had made grand rounds 
together, and he had found 
everything in perfect order, 
she again saluted and asked 
the proper question in the 
proper way: “Sir, can you 
now relieve the guard: we've 
been on duty for a week?” 
The problems of the frontier 
of New France that faced the 
Iroquois were not different 
from those of the English fron- 
tier that was destined slowly 
to work its way across the con- 
tinent. Elsewhere, the French 
made friends with the Indians 
and had little trouble.

SECTION IV 
THE FALL OF NEW FRANCE, 1713-1763 
E land had peace for thirty years. But the French were so exhausted by the 
later wars of Louis XIV that they acquiesced in being governed by the cradle 
and the grave throughout this period of decline. Louis XV came to the throne 
at the age of five in 1715, and Cardinal Fleury was seventy at his accession in 1723 to 
twenty years of power. 
French Acadia was already in complete eclipse, having been ceded to the British by 
the Treaty of Utrecht; and the shadow was stealing across the Laurentian regions 
of New France. Only Louisiana looked, for one moment, bright; and that was really 
due to a purely artificial flare. In 1718 Bienville founded New Orleans, the tiny capital 
of Louisiana, which then included the whole Mississippi region, known and unknown. 
The great French age of exploration ended with La Salle. But La Vérendrye and 
his four sons, all French-Canadians from Three Rivers, began in 1731 a quest for the 
Western Sea which reached its climax on New Year’s Day in 1743, when the sons became 
the first Frenchmen who ever saw the Rockies. 
Meanwhile the fur trade followed its checkered course, with all the usual interrup- 
tions from English-speaking rivals and the always hostile Iroquois. Montreal was the 
great emporium, where the Indians often came with pelts, as did the voyageurs and 
trappers who spoke French. Three Rivers was a much-smaller trading center. But it 
had some business brought down by the St. Maurice; and, like Montreal, it was the 
seat of a Lieutenant-Governor. 
In 1753 young George Washington, sent by Virginia to the Ohio country, warned the 
French to leave the region claimed by England. Their answer was a flat refusal. Then 
came the events of the last great war with England for colonial empire in the New World. 
Expeditions were sent by the English into the Ohio country. Others went up “the great 
war-path”” by Lake Champlain to strike Montreal. Wolfe with his fleet and army 
finally penetrated the St. Lawrence and captured Quebec. Then the structure which 
France had reared in the valley of the St. Lawrence collapsed. But subsequent events 
were to prove that the dream of a French empire in America was not to die. Napoleon 
revived the old vision in his plans for Hayti and Louisiana; but failed to achieve his 
objective. When in 1803 he sold the vast territory west of the Mississippi to the young 
United States, the French flag passed forever from the continent of North America. 
The French and Indian war destroyed the last vestige of French power along the banks 
of the St. Lawrence. Protestant England ruled over Catholic New France. The officials 
went home and the province was abandoned by its political and social leaders. Of all 
French institutions transplanted into the New World the Church alone remained. 
Faced with possible inundation by an alien and heretic people, the clergy of New France, 
supported by the liberal policy of the conqueror, sought to lead their flocks in such a 
way as to retain the unity of the French racial group. Modern French Canada is, to a 
large extent, the result of their foresight and statesmanship.

  326 THE PAGEANT OF AMERICA 
BIENVILLE, FOUNDER OF NEW ORLEANS, 1680-1765 
Five years after the close of Queen Anne’s War, Bienville, in 1718, founded 
New Orleans, which, four years later, became the capital of that vast 
province of Louisiana which stretched northward and westward no one 
knew how far. Bienville was one of the eleven sons of Charles Le Moyne, 
a famous French-Canadian seigneur. Iberville was another. New Orleans 
was the southernmost outpost of a French empire in North America like 
that of which La Salle had dreamed and had given his life to found. In 
area the domain of New France was vastly greater than the actual holdings 
of the English seaboard. England also claimed the continental interior. 
  699 From an o1 
Dépot des Cartes et Plans de la Marine, 
PLAN OF NEW ORLEANS 
Cuartevorx, chronicler and priest, described 
New Orleans as a little group of a hundred 
wretched hovels, in a malarious thicket of 
willows and dwarf palmettos, infested with ser- 
pents and alligators. Much of the population 
in the early days was of the most undesirable 
sort —deported galley-slaves and city scourings. 
There were also trappers and gold hunters 
accustomed to the wilds. All together they 
made a very turbulent population.

La Harre was very unassuming here. His 
boundaries for Louisiana are very restricted. 
Forty years later, in the map published in

France, Louisiana can be seen stretching from

THE FRENCH AT MOBILE 
Frencu influence and settlements spread eastward along the Gulf in the early eighteenth century. The map 
shows the site of the settlement on Isle Dauphine at the mouth of the Bay — the French settlement of 
Mobile, founded 1702 by Iberville, being to the north on the western side of the Bay. Mobile was the capital 
of Louisiana until 1720, when Biloxi became the capital. 
THE SOUTH SEA BUBBLE 
TueE year after Bienville founded New Orleans the flare of preposterous speculation threw its distorting light 
upon Louisiana. John Law, a Franco-Scotsman, who was at first mistaken for a wizard of finance, pooled 
all the oversea French companies into a state corporation which people mistook for the actual owner of all 
the extra-European wealth of the whole world that did not already belong to the British, Spaniards, or 
Dutch. Louisiana was to be the modern Eldorado whence millions would come every day. When shares 
rose to forty times par, and some real millions were consequently 
made overnight, the speculative public went mad. A few months 
later, in 1720, the “Mississippi Bubble” burst, to the utter ruin 
of all who, having lost their heads, never came to their senses in 
time.

No authentic portrait of that consummate arch-fiend, Francois Bigot, apparently exists. But this picture of

of the heroic Montcalm, the last and greatest champion of New France. Montcalm lived in unpretentious 
winter quarters and ate scraggy 
horseflesh when the wretched 
colony was dying. Knavish 
Bigot and foolish Vaudreuil lived 
in all the luxury that New France 
could yield them by disgraceful 
means. When the whole country 
surrendered at Montreal in Sep- 
tember, 1760, and the French and 
French-Canadians who had sur- 
vived six desperate campaigns laid

     CHAPTER XVIII 
SPAIN IN THE SOUTHWEST 
URING the hundred years following the defeat of the Armada, years when 
D the English were planting colonies on the Atlantic seaboard and the French 
explorers from Quebec and Montreal were penetrating the hinterland, Spain 
steadily declined. She had banished the Moors and Jews, two important factors in her 
economic structure. Treasure-seeking in the New World had diverted the energies of 
many of her people from productive activities. As the flow of treasure slackened, the 
impoverishment of national resources became increasingly apparent. Wars with the 
Dutch and with England sapped the Spanish military strength. One after another 
Spain’s possessions in Europe slipped from her. Spanish power in the Netherlands, the 
Rhineland and Italy was curtailed or disappeared altogether. In 1640, Portugal revolted 
and became once more independent. With Portugal, Spain lost Brazil and the Portuguese 
colonies in the Far East. 
But the same years that saw the waning of the Spanish power in Europe witnessed 
the growth of New Spain in America. Steadily the Spanish viceroys spread the laws and 
language of Spain and the faith of the Catholic Church over peoples and lands more and 
more remote from the Mexican capital. Explorers made their way northward across 
the dry country of northern Mexico. Missionaries and colonists followed them. In 
1609, two years after the English planted their first permanent colony at Jamestown, 
Santa Fé was founded. From New Mexico the Spanish frontier in course of time pushed 
into Texas. The eighteenth century saw a Spanish advance in another direction. A 
foothold was first won on the peninsula of Lower California. Then Spanish missions and 
presidios (forts) appeared in the valleys of California. 
Almost always the missionary was to be found leading the advance. The wild tribes 
that lay to the west and north of the seat of the Aztec power offered little to the seeker of 
gold; hence the seeker for souls for a time had a free hand. The missionary taught the 
gospel and trained the Indians to be self-supporting in a rudimentary civilization. Wander- 
ing tribes were gathered into pueblos beside the missions and sometimes held there by 
force. Close on the heels of the mission came the presidio or fort, which marked the 
establishment of military and political power. Both mission and presidio were looked 
upon as transitory. The officials of New Spain looked forward to a day when their 
holdings would be consolidated and when New Spain would take on something of the 
settled quality of the motherland.

SPAIN IN THE SOUTHWEST 333 
  
PALACE OF THE VICEROYS 
Wrrn her decline as a power in Europe, Spain 
looked more and more to her New World posses- 
sions to supply her with gold and to uphold her 
prestige. To Mexico she looked to guard her 
frontier from English and French encroachment. 
The vice-regal palace housed a succession of strong 
men, who kept high state and dignity in the 
capital, were bold and ruthless in the quelling 
of revolt, and energetic in sending out exploring 
and conquering expeditions north by land and 
sea. They wrote Texas, New Mexico, Arizona 5 
and California upon the map of New Spain. See i SA, ee eee, 
    
NATIVE LIFE PICTURED BY

Friar Beaumont (see No. 236) here pictures a 
banquet scene in which natives have prepared 
a feast for General Nafiuma and the Spanish

To this crude sketch the good Friar attached 
in his own hand a few notes in Spanish which 
illustrate the complete subserviency of the 
simple natives to the military authority of 
the invaders.

OLD CATHEDRAL IN MEXICO CITY 
In the life of Mexico the Church was a symbol as imposing as the vice-regal palace. The great cathedral, 
which stands on or near the site of the Aztec temple, was begun in 1573, and finished in 1811. During the 
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it was the most imposing and most beautiful building in America.

  MAP OF NEW MEXICO IN 1717 
Tue Spaniards colonized New Mexico. By 1617 
zealous Franciscans had built seven churches and 
baptized fourteen thousand Indians. But the Spanish 
hand lay heavy on the native tribes. The deeply 
rooted religious customs of the Indians were suppressed; 
severe penalties followed infringement of the rules of 
the Church; tribute was levied on the conquered 
people. In 1680 the Indians revolted. Four hundred 
Spaniards were massacred and New Mexico passed again 
into the control of its ancient rulers.

Spaniards had returned. The missions are shown by

THE REOCCUPATION OF 
NEW MEXICO 
Durine the years of their inde- 
pendence the Indians attempted 
to destroy the vestiges of the 
Spanish civilization. The churches, 
particularly, were objects of their 
wrath. But in 1692, a new com- 
mander, Don Diego de Vargas, 
approached from the valley of the 
Rio Grande. He came to Santa 
Fé and persuaded its people to 
surrender. The Cross was again 
  raised in New Mexico and the 
Spanish power ruled in the pueblos.    From R. E. Twitchell, Leadin Facts of New Mexican History, Cedar awing by Kenneth M, Chapman

LA SALLE AT THE FRENCH COURT 
Eneuanp had challenged New Spain on the Pacific. France 
now threatened from the region of the Mississippi. La Salle, 
having gone south from Canada, and, having reached, in a 
canoe, the mouth of the Father of Waters in 1682, claimed 
the region for Louis XIV. Returning to France he asked and 
received the monarch’s assent to build a fort at the mouth 
of the great river. (See pp. 320 and 321.)

selected the experienced frontiersman, Alonzo de Leén, to lead an army northeastward across the Rio Grande, 
to destroy the colony which La Salle might plant on the Missis- 
sippi River. On his third journey Leén found La Salle’s aban- 
doned fort, which was set afire presently by Father Massanet, 
who accompanied him. After Alonzo’s death Domingo Teran, 
in 1691, entered Texas but, like Ledén, failed to make a perma- 
nent establishment.       
FRA MARGIL PREACHING TO INDIANS 
Tur Frenchman Pierre Le Moyne d’Iberville, in 1699, settled 
acolony near the Mississippi and named the country Louisiana. 
His brother Bienville later came to govern the region. French- 
men explored the Mississippi, the Mobile and the Red Rivers. 
France in the north built forts from Detroit to St. Louis and 
then at the mouth of the Mississippi. (See p. 315.) French 
traders went into Texas. It was indeed time for Spain to 
make Texas hers.

PRESIDIO OF SAN 
ANTONIO, 1722 
As a result of the efforts 
of Father Margil, a num- 
ber of missions were es- 
tablished in Texas. To 
strengthen these outposts 
and secure a base of 
operations against the 
French, the Spanish au- 
thorities decided to erect 
a military post and settle- 
ment on the San Antonio 
River. Early in 1718 
sixty-two settlers were 
sent out accompanied by 
friars and soldiers. By 
these the presidio of 
San Antonio was erected, 
just three months before 
Bienville founded New 72)” qrom antonio de la Pela, Derrotero de la expedicion en la Provincia de Tezas, Mexleo, 1722, in the Orleans. About the pre- Archives of the Indies, Seville 
sidio were established a settlement and the San Antonio, or Alamo, mission. 
Two other establishments fastened the Spanish hold upon Texas. They were the mission and presidio of 
Nacogdoches, far to the eastward near Louisiana, and Bahia del Espiritu, near the site of La Salle’s fort on 
Matagorda Bay.   
  
  PLAN OF PRESIDIO AT ADAES, 1721 
Tue most important French post in this debatable southland was Natchitoches on the Red River com- 
manding western Louisiana. In 1721 a Spanish force led by the Marquis of Aguayo erected the Presidio of 
Los Adaes, now Robeline, La., fifteen miles from Natchitoches. “On the top of this elevation, which com- 
manded the whole plain,” wrote La Pefia in 1721, “‘his lordship laid out and began at once to build the 
fortification. He gave it 
the form of a hexagon, 
making each side about 
fifty-five yards long. He 
left three bastions un- 
constructed and made the 
other three smaller than 
he had planned. These 
he placed at the alternate 
corners so that each should 
protect two sides of the 
fort. He made these 
changes in his plan to suit 
the nature of the land and 
the few soldiers assigned 
to the fort.”” —Botton AnD

of Texas, New York, 1904.

Spaniards fixed the capital

ULLOA, FIRST SPANISH GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA 
Spain entered the Seven Years’ War (1756-63), as the ally of 
France; and by secret treaty in 1761 acquired Louisiana. France 
had lost Canada to England and was trying to prevent Louisiana 
also from falling into the 
same hands. 
In 1766 Spain sent Juan 
Antonio de Ulloa (No. 
731), as first governor of 
Spanish Louisiana. Ulloa 
was a well-known scientist 
and naval officer. He had 
once been captured by the 
English, taken to London 
as a prisoner of war and 
there, as a scientist, made 
a member of the Royal 
Society of London.

GOVERNOR O’REILLY, ca. 1730-94 
Tue French inhabitants resented the transfer of their allegiance 
by treaty. They hampered Ulloa in every way and finally chose a 
new governor backed by a military force. In 1768 Alejandro 792, rom, the portrait by Andres Molingry Sy 
O'Reilly, the new governor (No. 732), determined to stamp out "188 
rebellion and to make an example of Louisiana. He secured information regarding the leaders of revolt, 
arrested them while they were his guests at a reception and had them summarily executed. Spain 
thus took control of Louisiana in fact as well as in name.

OLD SPANISH PALACE AND CATHEDRAL, NEW ORLEANS 
Brenvit1e had founded New Orleans in 1718 and made it the capital of Louisiana in 1722. It was originally 
a swampy, unhealthful 
place and its growth was 
slow; but it was a favorite 
rendezvous for gold- 
hunters, trappers, buc- 
caneers, many of whom 
were deported galley- 
slaves. The raising of the 
Spanish flag made little 
change in New Orleans. 
The larger part of the city 
was destroyed by fire in 
1788. Its real develop- 
ment began with the 
sugar industry which was 
put on a sound basis in 
1795. In 1803 it had 
about 10,000 inhabitants 
to witness the ceremonial 
transfer of Louisiana to 
the United States.

AN “ISLAND CALLED CALIFORNIA” 
Tue story of California differs from that of Texas. In 
1510 an author named Montcalvo published a romance 
titled Esplandién in which he said: “Know that on 
the right hand of the Indies there is an island called 
California very close to the side of the Terrestrial Para- 
dise . . . in the whole island there was no metal but 
gold.” Hence the name California, which Cortés is 
said to have bestowed on the “island” of Lower Cali- 
fornia, where he went in search of the gold and the 
other marvels described by Montcalvo.

Spain at home had been crippled. She 
could no longer gather shiploads of

make loyal subjects of them, and thus 
provide her new lands with a well dis-

CARLOS II, KING OF SPAIN, 
1716-88 
Cartos III ascended the Spanish throne 
in 1759, the year in which Portugal exiled 
the Jesuits and in which Quebec fell before 
the armies of Wolfe. He entered the 
Seven Years’ War as France’s ally and 
secured Louisiana from her by secret 
treaty. But he lost Cuba and the Philip- 
pines to the English. To get them back 
he was forced to surrender Florida. The 
English now held the Atlantic coast, the 
Ohio Valley, and Canada. Carlos de- 
termined to secure the Pacific coast by 
planting fortified colonies at strategic points 
in Upper California. Military power had 
come to strengthen the hold of the mis- 
sionaries.

Arter the establishment of Salvatierra’s

an island. Not so Father Kino, the great 
missionary of the southwest. Kino made 
over fifty journeys. He traversed the sandy 
Devil’s Highway; crossed many times the 
country between the Gila and Magdalena 
Rivers; and in 1702, he explored the Colorado 
from the Gila’s mouth to the Gulf of Cali- 
fornia. His map first clearly showed the 
land route to Lower California, and that this 
country was a peninsula and not an island.           740 From "Lettres Edificantes (eta), Vol. v, Paris, 1724, In the New York iblic Library

     SERRA CROSSING THE DESERT 
Serra had desired to make his own the spirit of 
St. Francis of Assisi. Efficient organizer and executive 
as he was, yet it is as a Christian and a humanitarian 
that he stands outagainst the colorful background of his 
California. Spaniards and Indians alike were devoted 
to him. His co-workers in the Faith reverenced him 
as one who has attained in this world something of 
the invisible Kingdom of Heaven. The keynote of 
his life and labors was sounded in the first words with 
which he greeted his dark-skinned “children,” whether 
in the mission patio, in the vineyard, or the road- 
ways — “Love God.”

NOTES ON THE PICTURES 
Tes notes are predicated on the obvious fact that while historical pictures as visual aids giving 
swift mental impressions have a recognizable value for the teacher, student and general reader, they 
also have definite limitations. They vary in reliability. The original source of each picture is indicated 
in the attribution printed under the cut and this in many cases sufficiently establishes its authenticity. In 
some cases the text carries criticism or correction of the pictures. The many pictures of the sort called “fan- 
ciful” by historians, creations of the imagination of well-known painters, will call for reservation because of 
the very nature of their conception and execution. Comment and criticism on many such pictures are given 
in the notes that follow. An historical painter’s reconstruction of an event which he did not witness may 
well express the spirit of the event and its local setting. More than this it cannot do. The painter can infuse 
a picture with the moral or religious significance of a great occasion, can translate a great moment of history 
in terms of its political meaning for posterity, or re-create a scene which has all the elements of a thrilling 
adventure. Pictures of the imagination, however, still remain what they are intended primarily to be, — 
works of creative art and not historical works. As such, they are here subjected to criticism. They should 
be studied more for what they suggest than as literal renderings of the facts. With such considerations in 
mind the following notes, which make no pretense of completeness, have been prepared as preliminary aids 
to any who would examine the individual pictures more fully.

“T am unable to discover that anybody here

An ideal conception of an event which probably 
did not take place. Painting, by a notable 
Italian painter of the modern school, accu- 
rately expresses ecclesiastical hostility to and 
ridicule of Columbus’ scheme. 
By a Spanish artist. Studied in Paris under 
Bonnat. His Columbus pictures based on 
his own study of scenes in Spain which figure 
in the Discoverer’s career. The mounting of 
the globe is of a type about one hundred years 
later. 
According to Sefior Machado of the Junta de 
Iconografia Nacional, Madrid, portrait was 
done by Isabella’s order in her lifetime and 
by her presented to the Cartuja (Carthusian 
Order) of Miraflores, whence it passed into 
the possession of Philip V. 
Artist studied abroad, and in 1881 went to 
Spain to collect first-hand material for this 
painting, which in 1883 was purchased by 
order of Congress for the capitol. 
For the painting here reproduced artist was 
awarded the Cross of Carlos III at the Na- 
tional Exposition at Madrid, 1877.

place at Santa Fé, in the Spanish military 
camp in the plain before Grenada, architec- 
tural details of the picture are much overdone. 
No evidence to show that the occasion was 
one of such ceremony and splendor. The 
jewels displayed on the table perpetuate an 
exploded fiction. See 196, text. 
. Accurate view from colored wood engraving, 
over five feet long. See 159. 
. Artist painted many pictures on Spanish 
history for that government by invitation 
of the Minister of War. 
. Replica, made for the Columbian Exposition, 
1893, of the flagship of Columbus, from speci- 
fications supplied by the Spanish government. 
. Artist was Director of the Academy at Prague, 
1841-52. 
. Artist, an American much of whose life was 
spent abroad, was commissioned by the U. S. 
government to paint this picture, for which he 
received $10,000. It shows little trace of the 
artist’s earlier style or ability (e.g., his Marius 
on the Ruins of Carthage). Bishop William I. 
Kip alleged that the picture was partly the work 
of a clever Frenchman, whom Kip had seen at 
work on it in Paris (The Atlantic Monthly, 
February, 1867). The friar behind Columbus 
and the kneeling boy are inaccuracies. 
. Sketch done at Watling Island of conjectural 
landing place of Columbus. Cronau’s con- 
clusions as to this and other points in the 
Columbus story are discussed by C. K. Adams 
in Some Recent Discoveries Concerning Colum- 
bus, in Annual Report of the American His- 
torical Association, 1891.

Arts, Valencia, exhibitor at Expositions in 
1886 and 1887, Madrid, later Director of 
School of Fine Arts, San Fernando. Exhibitor

well expresses the wonder of the red men. 
Indians at the landing carried lances, not 
bows and arrows. 
. Portrait of Indian woman much idealized. 
The live parrots and stuffed birds to which, 
according to Las Casas, Columbus pointed as he 
addressed the sovereigns, do not appear in the 
picture. According to Peter Martyr (1455- 
1526), who was present, the sovereigns invited 
Columbus to be seated in their presence.

later paintings were to express. 
Painter a pupil of Benjamin West. The 
painting was the first ambitious attempt to 
depict the Pilgrim “landing.” When ex- 
hibited in 1815 made considerable stir. As 
history it is worthless. Picture referred to 
by Webster, in Plymouth oration, 1820. 
Lucy’s painting is in harmony with the moral 
and religious significance which was given the 
landing by Webster’s Plymouth Rock oration, 
1820, and Longfellow’s poems. Picture shows 
strong French influence in figures and cos- 
tumes, Lucy having studied art and painted 
this picture in France. 
Gisbert’s “Landing” carries the religious 
aspect to an extreme. Artist was Director 
of the Prado Gallery, 1867-70. Repeats an 
error in Lucy’s picture of cliffs rising above 
the water. 
Picture strikes a new note. Religious aspect 
subordinated. A determined facing of the 
wilderness most striking feature. 
Artist shows influence of Bougereau and Jean 
Paul Géréme, under whom he studied. His 
fifty or more canvases on American history 
reveal a frank striving for rich color effects

Built of stone 2 ft. thick in 1695, in the form 
of a T. Picture shows the building at date of 
the print. 
Artist studied abroad and exhibited at the 
Paris Salon. The picture an idealization but 
authentic in spirit. 
Map is based on the map of Virginia, engraved 
by William Hole, in Smith’s True Relation 
of Virginia (Oxford, 1612). 
An idealization by a talented American painter 
of mural decorations on historical subjects. 
Portrait presented to Virginia State Library 
by American descendants of Claiborne. Not 
authenticated. 
. Authenticity of portrait is not established. 
. Apparently under the inspiration of Moale’s 
sketch, 552. 
. Artist a well-known illustrator for English 
journals. 
. Exaggerated view probably published as 
propaganda for colonization. 
. No authentic portrait of Cartier. 
. Original by a well-known English painter for 
the Quebec Tercentenary, 1908. 
. According to Justin Winsor, the plan was 
simply a bird’s-eye view of an Indian camp, 
added by Gastaldi, map-maker for Ramusio’s 
account of Cartier. 
The so-called Champlain portrait here repro- 
duced is from a lithograph done in 1854 by 
Louis César Joseph Ducornet (1806-1856), a 
French artist deformed from birth, having 
neither arms nor thighs and but four toes to 
his right foot. All alleged portraits of Cham- 
plain have been derived or adapted from it 
directly or indirectly, and no authentie portrait 
of Champlain exists. See “A Critical Exami- 
nation of Champlain’s Portraits,” by 
V. H. Paltsits, in Acadiensis, Vol. IV (1904). 
Curiously enough some of these adaptations 
have been attributed to Balthazar Moncornet, 
another French artist (born 1615). H. P. Big- 
gar, in The Canadian Historical Review, Vol. I 
(1920), reproduces a portrait of Michel Parti- 
celli, Contréleur-Général des Finances, en- 
graved by Moncornet in 1654, proving that, 
with variations of background and other 
modifications, it is the source of the Ducornet 
lithograph that was metamorphosed into a 
portrait of Champlain just two centuries later. 
This alleged portrait of De Monts is without 
the least right to authenticity. It has been 620.

books and magazines, specializing on American 
history. 
Portrait possibly derived from the standing 
figure of Brébceuf at right of plate 646. 
Imaginary conception based on accounts in 
Jesuit narratives. 
Artist studied in Paris under Boulanger and 
Lefebvre. Made special study of Indian 
life. 
Sculptor studied abroad and since 1896 has 
created many impressive studies of Indian 
life, also sculptures for memorials. 
This portrait of La Salle, according to Justin 
Winsor (Vol. IV, p. 242) first appeared in 
M. Pierre Margry’s Mémoires et Documents, 
etc., Part I, Paris, 1876. It was copied from 
the figure of La Salle in the copper-plate by 
Vander Gucht for Hennepin’s Nouvelle Decou- 
verte, 1697, (689), drawn reversed. The en- 
graver merely made an enlargement of the 
head and shoulders from the murder scene, 
this being used as a frontispiece in M. Margry’s 
work. It has since been commonly known as 
the Waltner engraving. The only portrait 
of La Salle which has any standing is that seen 
in the small cut, 678. This was reproduced 
for The Pageant of America, by M. de la 
Ronciére of the Bibliothéque Nationale, from 
a print in that institution from an engraving 
in the Bibliothéque de Rouen. 
Conjectural; nothing is known about La Salle’s 
ship. Probably it was much smaller than 
represented. Apparently derived from the 
Hennepin picture (686). 
By a well-known illustrator; 
correct. 
Very doubtful if the French built so formidable 
a palisade, La Salle’s party at this time being 
a small one. 
Topography correct, picture otherwise con- 
jectural. essentially

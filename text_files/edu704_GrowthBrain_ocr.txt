PREFACE. 
0. SS 
  WE are told that this age is one of nervous strain. 
Probably in their own time the monsters of cretaceous 
days would have expressed a similar opinion, had the 
opportunity been granted them. From the beginning, 
the outer world has modified all animals possessed of 
a nervous system mainly by its aid, and as far as this 
system could alter its reactions, just so far could the 
animal adapt itself to the changed environment. 
In this generation, to be sure, our cephalic centres are 
sometimes overworked, whereas in the remote past 
the stress fell more on other parts ; but we are rather 
allied to the rock-bound dead by an inherited power to 
respond than separated from them by a recent capacity 
for nerve exhaustion. 
As the reader will perceive, these remarks might 
serve to magnify the office of this book by suggesting 
how fundamental to the welfare of all higher animals 
are the powers of the nervous system, and therefore 
how important it will be to search out the growth 
changes which produce them. 
It seemed desirable to bring together in a compre- 
hensive way the facts bearing on this portion of the 
problem. In discussions upon growth, the valuable 
records on brain-weight are sometimes alone brought 
forward, but there exist a vast number of other facts, 
which, when joined with these, illuminate not only them, 
but the entire field of view, and indicate the unworked 
areas within it. I have Supeore =e especially to

6 PREFACE, 
emphasise some more neglected points. Let me enume- 
rate a few: the growth of the nervous system compared 
with that of the body ; the interpretation of brain-weight 
in terms of cell structure ; the early limitation of the 
number of nerve cells;,the peculiar relation in this 
system between increase in size and in organisation ; 
the large though variable number of cells which have 
but slight importance in the final structure ; the domi- 
nance of nutritive conditions; the wide diffusion of 
nerve impulses; the incompleteness of repose; the 
reflex nature of all responses; the native character of 
mental powers; and the comparative insignificance of 
formal education. 
To those who deal with the nervous system as it 
grows, the facts within these covers will, I trust, be 
useful; the parent, the teacher, and the physician 
represent three classes who seek for light upon such 
matters, and it would be fortunate if, as a result of their 
demands, there soon should be supplied an account of 
growth far more extensive and more luminous than this. 
In putting together the materials employed, I have 
sought the counsel and assistance of my friends who 
took an interest in the work, and: to them I would 
express my gratitude, yet without transferring my 
responsibilities. Save in a few cases, the illustrations 
in this book have been copied from standard works, 
and I am greatly indebted to both authors and pub- 
lishers for the uniform courtesy with which permission 
has been granted to have this done. To Messrs. 
Macmillan & Co., publishers of Foster’s Physiology ; 
Longmans, Green & Co., publishers of Quain’s Anatomy ; 
Ginn & Co., publishers of Zhe Journal of Morphology ; 
D. Appleton & Co., publishers of Zhe Popular Science 
Monthly, and to the proprietors of Zhe Lancet, my 
acknowledgments are especially due.

THE living world of which we are a part is ever 
changing. Unceasingly from seeds and eggs new 
generations arise, and each day those which have 
completed the cycle of a life pass to their final disso- 
lution. The history of these changes forms a record 
difficult to interpret, yet perennially interesting, since 
each question solved is at once replaced by the group of 
problems from which it sprang. Among the current 
problems I shall select a series, and the study here 
proposed will deal with those relating to the growth of 
the brains of animals. To the understanding of them, a 
review of the more important observations which broadly 
underlie the laws of growth will form a fitting intro- 
ductioa.

tute the vertebrate group, to which man himself belongs, 
and since the changes in the vertebrates are those of 
greatest interest, the facts presented will especially apply 
to them. 
Minute anatomy has taught us that all animals are 
composed of small structural elements—cells. Those 
microscopic portions of living matter, usually but a 
small fraction of a millimeter in diameter, possess, 
whatever their shape, two principal parts: a small and 
denser portion centrally located, the nucleus, and sur- 
rounding this a more fluid and bulkier portion, which 
forms the body of the ccll, the cytoplasm ; the latter 
being so altered at its surface that its 
outermost layer constitutes an enclosing 
envelope, the cell-membrane. The cyto- 
plasm and the enclosed nucleus are

is principally composed, and therefore all of them 
are the lineal descendants of the ovum, which is, in 
its first form, but a single cell. The formation of 
the animal-body from this simplest beginning, with all 
that this implies of cell-multiplication, enlargement, and 
specialisation, is the result of changes first showing 
themselves within the ovum. (Fig. 1.) 
In order that these changes may occur, the ovum 
must, save in a few exceptional cases, undergo fertilisa- 
tion, the essential feature of which is the union with it 
of a second element, the sperm-cell. As a result of this 
union, the cytoplasm of the two cells is condensed into N.    
 
-P-A-G-E-23
AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF GROWTH. 23 
one, the two nuclei unite to form a single nucleus, and 
thus modified, the fertilised ovum or egg begins to 
grow. 
The first indication of such growth is a division of 
the egg into a number of cells, without much enlarge- 
ment of the total mass. 
This is, apparently the arrangement of the cell 
substance best suited for vigorous nutrition, and as the 
increase in bulk depends on nutritive processes, the 
importance of it is plain.t Later the nutritive conditions

  improve, and with this improvement the size of the mass 
increases. 
The processes which lead to subdivision are first 
evident in the nuclear structures, which become the seat 
of complicated but, at the same time, perfectly orderly 
changes. As a result, the constituents of the nucleus 
divide into two portions which separate from one 
another, the surrounding cytoplasm gathers about the 
respective daughter-nuclei, and these two portions then 
become marked off by the cell-membrane ; thus, in the 
' place of one cell, two cells are now present. By cell-

division occurring in this way, and accompanied by 
changes in the size and form of the elements, the com- 
plex individual is built up. 
What is thus accomplished in the case of man is 
roughly indicated by the following calculations :—Ac- 
cording to the estimate of C. Francke," there are, in the 
entire body of a full-grown person, a number of fixed 
cells represented by 4,000,000,000,000. The cells in the 
blood are not fixed, and for these the best calculations 
give 22,500,000,000,000, or, in the entire body, a total of 
26,500,000,000,000 cells. This number may appear 
surprisingly large, but it must be remembered that there 
are in a cubic millimeter 
1,000,000,000 cubic p (the 
micron=p being ooo1 of a 
millimeter, and the unit 
adopted by histologists in 
micrometry); so that if each 
cell in the human body had 
but. the volume of one cubic 
pw, the whole number could

a volume of 66,200 cu. cms. As stated above, all the 
cells of the body might be contained in 22°5 cu. cm., 
provided each cell had a volume of only 1 cu. By

simple division of the former volume by the latter, it 
appears that the average volume of the cells under the 
condition named, is 2,942 cu. », equivalent toa cube 14 p, 
on each edge, which is by no means small. 
The nutrition of a cell depends on the surrounding 
medium from which it derives food, either directly by 
the incorporation of small particles, or, as is more usual 
in higher animals, by the diffusion of the nutrient sub- 
stances in a fluid form. For this latter process the 
surface of the cell must be exposed to the nutrient fluid, 
a condition easily fulfilled in the case of single cells or 
those arranged in thin layers. When, however, the 
mass of cells becomes large, the nourishment of those 
below the surface is indirectly accomplished by the 
conveyance of the nutrient fluid to them through vessels 
that penetrate the mass. Between the blood in these 
vessels and the surrounding cells the process of diffusion 
then takes place. This arrangement leaves to the cells 
most directly in contact with the ingested material the 
peculiar duty of preparing the food for distribution by 
diffusion, and here arises a good instance of the division 
of labour among the cells leading to that mutual de- 
pendence of which the completed organism offers so 
many examples, for it holds true through the entire 
series of the activities of the animal body, that each 
is carried on by elements specially modified for the 
purpose. 
All these different forms of physiological activity ex- 
hibited by the higher animals are found to be present in 
many of the unicellular organisms, and are assumed to 
be present in them all. For this reason, the development 
of different capacities by different groups of cells is best 
regarded, neither as the sudden acquisition of a new 
power, nor as a peculiar capacity only inherent in a 
particular group of elements, but as arising simply from  
-P-A-G-E-26
26 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN, 
an emphasis of one of the several powers originally ' 
common to them all. The specialised cell is therefore 
physiologically unbalanced, if not incomplete; and so the 
more exquisitely a cell is adapted to some particular 
function, the less capable it is of performing the entire 
series of reactions indispensable to its very existence ; 
hence the more dependent it becomes upon its neigh- 
bours. 
Very early in the history of the development of an 
animal, before any of the organs are formed, yet when 
the number of cells is already large, these latter become 
separated into layers. (Fig. 4.) 
Fic. 4.—Transverse section to show the germ layers of a mole 
embryo, X 265 diam. (Heape, Quain’s Anatomy) ; ecto., 
ectoderm ; e7/o., entoderm ; eso , mesoderm. 
: The germ layers, as they are called, are composed 
of cell-groups, which tend to show special characters, 
according to the layer in which they occur. Ultimately 
the layers give rise to three main subdivisions of the 
body. From the ectoderm, or outer layer, are derived 
the skin and the nervous system ; from the inner layer, 
the entoderm, the alimentary tract with its appendages ; 
and from the layer which lies between the two, the 
mesoderm, are derived the muscles, the supporting 
tissues, the reproductive system, and the circulatory 
apparatus. 
It is for us to inquire how these portions grow, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF GROWTH. 27 
by what means the tiny organs to which they first give 
rise become the bulky organs of the adult. This 
increase must be due either to the swelling of the cells 
that are already formed, or to the formation of new ones 
by divisions of the old ; and in every instance it is to be 
determined whether one or both of these processes have 
been at work, and what share in the result may be 
attributed to each of them. 
The conception of a complicated animal body, as com- 
posed of a number of cells, was at first accompanied by 
the idea that the cells themselves were comparatively 
simple, and the simplicity of the cell was contrasted 
with the complexity of the whole organism. Unfortu- 
nately this notion of simplicity is misleading, for there 
are instances, the most striking being among the 
protozoa, in which a number of functions are carried 
on by different parts of the cytoplasm, although, accord- 
ing to definition, the entire animal forms but a single 
cell. But the facts in connection with which the idea 
of simplicity is least fit, are those relating to develop- 
ment. From the human ovum, for example, is gradually 
elaborated the complex adult, and it is difficult to escape 
the conviction that.in some measure at least the com- 
plexity of the latter is represented in the structure of 
the former. 
In carrying out this elaboration the course of events 
is mainly determined, not by the surrounding conditions, 
although these have some influence, but by conditions 
within the egg. The beginning of the growth process 
immediately follows fertilisation, and hence that may be 
looked upon as the initial impulse, but in what manner 
this impulse sets in motion the marvellous series of 
changes which are to result in the completed animal is 
not thereby explained. A few generations ago the 
development of animals was regarded as due to evolu-
-P-A-G-E-28
  28 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN, 
tion ; evolution in the sense that within the substance 
of the egg there was present, in an extremely reduced 
form to be sure, the perfect and complete animal, to 
which the egg was destined to give rise ; and it was 
held that the changes accompanying development con- 
sisted in an enlargement of this miniature. In this 
gross form the theory was soon discarded, but it is still 
current in a modern guise. The animal is no longer con- 
sidered to be pre-existent as a formed miniature, but it 
is assumed by many that condensed in this small bit 
of living matter are particles, molccules, if you please, 
which in some way have marked out for them a fixed 
course of development. In a sense, therefore, the future 
animal is still looked upon as pre-existent in the egg, 
since we know of no device by which any widely 
different species of animal can be made to grow from 
that particular cell. Yet despite the fact that the 
lines are so narrowly fixed, along which the eggs of 
different species develop, there are only slight cyto- 
logical differences to be observed among those from 
different animals ; and we have by no means reached 
the point where, by the examination of an egg-cell alone, 
any detailed prediction can be made concerning the 
form into which it might develop. The theory just 
mentioned probably expresses many of the facts of 
development, but there are other facts, such as the 
production of several embryos from a single egg or 
complete embryos from fractions of the egg, which show 
it to be at least incomplete. The significance of these 
‘non-conforming observations will be best understood 
from a few examples. 
It has been shown repeatedly that if from a cell the 
nucleus be removed, the cytoplasm ceases to grow, and 
shortly dies. When thus isolated, the nucleus also 
dies. Recently Wilson has studied the development of

the eggs of the Lancelet, Amphioxus.t In this simple 
fish it is possible to separate from one another the first 
two cells formed by the division of the egg. | The cells 
thus obtained continue to develop and go through a 
number of stages characteristic of the normal egg, but 
the larva is only half as large as the normal one, its 
component cells being reduced in size. This larva dies 
young, and whether it could be made to develop further 
is left for future experiment to decide. When the egg 
has already formed four cells, it is still possible in the 
same manner to separate one of these, which will also

develop alone, and give rise to a complete larva, save that 
it is only one-quarter the normal size. This is still more 
difficult to rear (Fig. 5). During the past year it has 
been shown (Morgan) that fragments of the unsegmented 
egg of the sea urchin may, when they contain both the 
male and female pronuclei, develop gastula, and this 
occurs even if nucleated fragments have but one-fiftieth

  the volume of the egg. The tiny gastula thus produced 
is composed of small cells, but not cells proportionately 
reduced in size, since they may have five times the 
volume of the cells composing the normal gastula. 
Multiple embryos from a single egg have been 
obtained by Loeb! in yet a different way. This investi- 
gator has succeeded in causing eggs, just fertilised, but 
still undivided, to swell so that the enclosing membrane 
ruptured, and a portion of the cell contents extruded

in the form of one or more buds or droplets. In due 
season these buds, as well as the cell substance remain- 
ing within the membrane, developed embryos. The 
multiple embryos thus formed are represented in the 
accompanying figure. Thus, where at the start the egg 
was morphologically but a single cell, it has been found

-P-A-G-E-31
  AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF GROWTH. 31 
possible, through change in the conditions surrounding 
it, to cause the development within it of more than one 
embryo. (Fig. 6.) 
In these experiments the attempt, is made to grow an 
animal from a cell or a part of a cell, which represents 
only a fraction of the substance naturally intended for 
the entire organism, and as one consequence the embryo 
is below the normal size. To interpret such phenomena 
in harmony with the idea of preformation in the egg, 
is a present line of zoological endeavour ; but, whatever 
may be the outcome, the striking fact remains, that such 
repair as occurs when complete embryos are reared from 
less than the entire egg, is not quantitative, because the 
size of the embryo bears a definite relation to the size of 
the original fragment. 
In this connection it may be asked why animals grow 
to that particular size which is characteristic for the 
different species ; why one egg yields a mouse, another 
an elephant? But until more facts on the size of egg- 
cells are available for comparison, speculation on the 
subject would be futile. 
Young and growing cells have a nucleus which is 
large when compared with the amount of cytoplasm, 
and the possibilities of growth and division in animal 
cells appear to be dependent on this relation. If this 
condition is a necessary one, it should be found univer- 
sally, even where growth, due to the regeneration of the 
lost. parts, is taking place. For not only is the ovum 
capable of producing the one complete animal, but, 
in addition, retains, in many forms, the power to 
reproduce lost parts. This process is the more interest- 
ing in view of the fact that among the invertebrates 
generally, and in many lower vertebrates also, especially 
when young, the regeneration of the lost parts seems so 
simple and common an occurrence, and can .take place 
>»  
-P-A-G-E-32
  32 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN, 
on so magnificent a scale. By repeated removal of the 
limbs Spallanzani obtained from a single newt in the 
course of three months 687 new bones. In the adult 
animals, to be sure, the regenerated portion is at first 
small, and only gradually reaches the normal size, but it 
ultimately does so, and the ease of this process, the 
rapidity of it, as well as the number of times it can be 
repeated, are all highly suggestive. This capacity for 
the reproduction of parts lost is much diminished in 
the higher vertebrates, and the decrease in this power is 
explained by their higher specialisation, or, in other 
words, the greater the number of generations between 
any group of somatic cells and the ovum from which 
they are derived, the less the capacity in them for 
regeneration. 
If the organism, as a whole, is highly specialised, it is 
due to the fact that the constituent cells are also 
specialised; so that in the animal series progressive 
specialisation may be expressed cither in terms of 
the entire animal or its structural elements. It has 
just been indicated that the embryonic condition of 
cells is that most favourable to growth, and it therefore 
follows that the processes of regeneration would be least 
perfect in the higher vertebrates whose cells had 
departed furthest from the embryonic condition. It is 
recognised, moreover, that the growth changes in cells 
are but incompletely reversible. Thus, when a cell has 
once become in a high degree modified, it loses the 
capability of reverting, under new conditions, to its 
primitive state. Here, again, in the animal series a 
gradation is evident, for those cells which are least 
highly modified and those composing the less specialised 
animals are the ones in which this reversion is most 
readily accomplished. In a broad way, then, the 
capacity for regeneration implies a latent youthfulness. 
A
-P-A-G-E-33
  AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF GROWTH. 33 
That the power, to grow is closely connected with the- 
length of life in different animals is beyond question, 
but a proper formulation of this connection is difficult. 
Certainly there is as yet no adequate explanation of the 
fact that some animals live longer than others ; we find 
that, in general, the larger animals are those having the 
longer life, and thus long life is to be associated with 
size; but, on examining this relation, it appears that 
size depends upon two factors—the rate of growth, and 
the length of time that growth continues, and animals 
that attain a large size grow both rapidly and for a 
long time. Minot has pointed out that if the guinea- 
pig,! rabbit, and man are compared as to their increase 
in weight the following interesting facts appear :—

year, the difference in the final size of the animals is 
very great. Since, then, natural death is the result of

.completed, and large size depends on long-continued 
growth, therefore long life and large size are found 
associated. 
The rate of growth is measured by the proportional 
increase in a unit of time. This is well shown in the

the first division of the egg, the capacity to grow is 
undergoing an almost steady diminution. This capacity, 
as the curve shows, must soon reach a point where it

practically amounts to nothing, and then it is that the 
body becomes most susceptible to destructive influences 
continuously at work upon it. With the decay of any 
portion of the organism comes a disturbance of the 
balance in the work allotted to the several portions. 
The other tissues not specialised for the purpose are 
forced to take on the functions of those already 
damaged, and this they can do but imperfectly. The 
result is progressive enfeeblement ef these overtaxed 
cells, until finally some function is so imperfectly per- 
formed that the life processes are blocked, and the 
organism as a whole dies. Minot pointed out that in 
the mature cell the proportion of cytoplasm to nucleus 
was greater than in the growing animal ; and on the 
ground of this propounds, half humorously, the 
aphorism, that “Protoplasm is the physical basis of 
advancing decrepitude.” By thus granting that the 
cytoplasm is in some way a hindrance to its own 
activity, the specialised body-cells are seen to be similar 
to the unicellular organisms, among which cell-enlarge- 
ment is so clearly self-limited. But it is plain that in 
speaking of cells and the relative development of their 
different portions, we are using these variations in the size 
of the nucleus and the cytoplasm merely as indices of 
more subtle structural and chemical changes which will 
form the proper basis for a future explanation. 
Though we infer that the ability to grow is, so far as 
it goes, a protection against commencing deterioration, 
yet a search for illuminating details does not yield much 
because of our meagre information concerning the length 
of life in animals. Popularly birds, reptiles, batrachians, 
and fishes are considered capable of living for very many 
years. It further appears that some reptiles and some 
fishes continue to grow almost as long as they live, but 
in later life their growth is certainly very slow. At the

same time birds, which in many instances are credited 
with more than a hundred years, have not been shown 
to undergo this long-continued growth. In the case of 
birds, therefore, neither continuous growth nor large size 
can be called in to explain long life, so that in reality 
the inherent conditions which determine longevity are 
still unrecognised. 
Nevertheless vertebrates may be divided into two 
principal groups, according to the manner in which 
they grow. There are those in which the size of the in- 
dividual is fixed, in the sense that some time long before 
the natural close of life growth ceases; and those in which 
growth changes are almost coextensive with life. To 
the former class man belongs, together with the other 
mammals and the birds, and to. the latter some fish, 
amphibia, and reptiles. 
It has been already stated that there are two ways in 
which an organism may increase in size: either by the 
increase of the number of cells composing it, or the 
number remaining the same, by an increase in their-mass. 
As a matter of fact, the two sets of changes always go 
hand in hand, but the share they take in the final result is 
not the same in different animals or different tissues, nor 
is it the same at the various periods in the life history 
of the same animal. The topic is worthy of some 
elaboration. 
The different classes of vertebrates aré similar in the 
fact that during the early life of the embryo, before the 
organs are formed, the chief factor giving rise to the 
increase in size is the production of new cells. As this 
production becomes less rapid, those cells which have 
been already formed undergo enlargement, together 
with such changes in structure as fit them for their 
special duties. The first process is thus gradually 
replaced by the second. In the human nervous system 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF GROWTH, 37. 
the production of new cells ceases some time before 
birth, though in some other mammals it may go on for 
a longer period, but in all it very early becomes the less 
significant method of increase. Before attaining any 
functional importance these newly-formed cells must 
pass through a long series of developmental changes. 
Thus in any organism the total number of structural 
elements is greater, and in early life very much greater, 
than is the number functionally perfected. Two dif- 
ferent methods in subsequent development of animals 
or tissues may be distinguished according to the time 
relations within which the constituent cells become 
mature:.in the one case the newly-formed cells may 
change almost simultaneously, or in’the other, these 
changes may be successive in the different cells, so that 
in the former instance the time interval demanded for 
the completion of growth is short, in the latter it is long. 
With these facts in view, an explanation of the growth 
processes in those animals which early attain a fixed 
size is to be found in the fact that in them cell develop- 
ment is condensed into a short period, which in the case 
of those in which growth is long continued the time 
during which the development of different cells may 
occur is increased. ‘Development and the changes 
involved in growing old are, however, by no means 
synonymous, so that although in those animals with a 
fixed size there are always to be found undeveloped 
cells, yet it is not a correct inference that these cells are 
also young in the sense that they might still complete 
their development. | It appears, rather, that the capacity 
for undergoing expansive change is transient, and that 
those cells which fail to react during the proper growing 
period of an animal have lost their opportunity for ever. 
Here again is a difference between the two groups of 
animals which have been contrasted, since in those the

size of which is least limited by age the possibility of 
development is more persistent. 
+ Connected with these facts are those bearing on the 
variations of size in animals of the same family or 
species. It is worthy of note that there are many cases 
where a type of vertebrate animal appearing at several 
geological horizons has the last representatives more 
bulky than the first, while the extremes are connected 
through the different horizons by a series of forms inter- 
mediate in size. Extinction in these cases apparently 
overtakes the type when its representatives have 
reached the greatest size, and the suggestion here is 
that species, like individuals, have a period of growth 
followed by specialisation, which latter is in the end 
the cause of their extinction, through the loss of adapta- 
bility to new conditions. On the other hand, some 
invertebrates slowly deteriorate in the course of their 
geological history—perhaps through an unequal struggle 
with changed conditions, which, though damaging, were 
not sufficient to exterminate them. 
The influences affecting the animal from without are 
expressed by the term environment ; while from within 
there is the complex of influences called heredity. 
Probably dependent on external conditions are the 
peculiarities of faunas on the smaller islands, one feature 
of which is the small size of the animals there found. 
So, too, the experiments of Yung? in rearing tadpoles 
indicate the relation between the capacity of the en- 
closing vessel and the possible size of the tadpole which 
was being reared in it. Semper and De Varigny 
obtained similar results with the pond snail (Lymnaea) ? 
by growing them in different quantities of water, varying

the conditions in many ways.’ Those in the larger 
amount of water were the larger, and beginning with 
those grown in the least quantity, which were the 
smallest, they could be arranged in a series increasing 
in size, according to the quantity of water in which they 
had been placed. The explanation of these suggestive 
results is, to say the least, obscure, but it must ultimately 
rest on variations in nutrition, which may be influenced 
by the amount of activity of the animal and the diffu- 
sion of its own waste products, which act as poisons, and 
which would be effective in proportion as the quantity 
of water was small. In a recent account of some con- 
ditions which modify growth, Bizzozero states that cell 
division is not stopped by starvation, though it may be 
thus decreased in intensity, and that inanition may even 
rouse dormant cells to the act of division. In the ear 
of the rabbit, hyperaemia causes increased cell multi- 
plication, together with increase in size of the ear ; and 
the same result may be effected by high temperature. 
Conversely, low temperature retards in a most remark- 
able manner the increase of the growing ear. When, 
however, the low temperature is replaced by a normal 
degree of heat, the ear previously dwarfed overtakes the 
one which has been left under the usual conditions, and 
very soon becomes equal to it in size By the aid of 
the nervous system the response of an animal to condi- 
tions influencing growth is modified in various ways. 
Among paired glands the removal of one causes in- 
creased size of the other. Here growth is compensatory. 
On the other hand Samuel found that the renewal of 
the feathers in a pigeon’s wing was modified by dis- 
turbances of the circulation, and also that when the 
disturbance was practised on one side only it caused 
an arrest of growth in the feathers on both sides,

thus bringing to light a mechanism for symmetrical 
growth.t 
The relations between geographical distribution and 
the colour and size of various birds and mammals of 
North America have been studied by Baird, Allen, and 
others.2 They found that the largest individuals were 
obtained from localities at. which the type was most 
numerously represented. Such localitics are designated 
as the centres of distribution, and are assumed to be 
those in which that type finds the best conditions for 
existence. Many maminals and birds are found to have 
their centres of distribution in the northern regions, and 
so to diminish in size from the northern to the southern 
latitudes, thus showing that mere increase in tempera- 
ture, which at first sight might be expected to favour 
size, does not do so in these cases. Reversed instances, 
where the centres of distribution are in southern latitudes, 
also occur, but they are not so numerous. Familiar are 
the enormous possibilities of variations in size among 
animals under domestication, and our small and large 
dogs and horses are sufficient indication of what can be 
done in part by selection. But it is quite in accordance 
with these facts to look upon size as a character mainly 
predetermined in the egg, and only to a moderate degree 
influenced by conditions acting through the lifetime of 
the individual. 
The increase in stature and weight of the higher 
animals has been found to show a periodic variation in 
the rate at which it goes on, whether the increase is 
due to the multiplication of cells, or simply to their 
enlargement. In many eggs when dividing there are 
between the periods of actual division long intervals in

which the contents of the egg are apparently inactive. 
Cell multiplication and enlargement therefore appear to 
be distinctly rhythmical processes, but it must be under- 
stood that the cell, though seemingly quiet, is, in a 
chemical sense, constantly active, and attention is here 
directed only to the fact that the evident processes in 
cell multiplication and enlargement are periodic ; like 
similar phenomena this periodicity is particularly accen- 
tuated at some times and in some species, though it 
probably holds for all stages of growth in all animals, 
man included. Yn 
On bringing the foregoing facts together we find that 
the animal body is composed of cells, which are the 
lineal descendants of the fertilised ovum. Any active 
cell, having reached a point at which it no longer 
divides, grows larger, the cytoplasm increasing more 
rapidly than the nucleus, Variations in structure 
appear, the shape alters, and accompanying all these is 
a steady change in chemical constitution. Chemically, 
therefore, the cells are being continuously modified, 
even though as structural elements they may have an 
existence conterminous with that of the entire organism. 
The complex animal when formed is composed of dif- 
ferent groups of cells, which, though they are fed by the 
same nutrient lymph, become structurally modified in 
such a manner that they are suited to the performance 
of limited and dissimilar functions, thus placing the 
several systems of tissues in a relation of mutual depen- 
dence. The size of the adult animal depends on the 
number and volume of the constituent cells. In develop- 
ment the determination of number precedes that of size, 
but the conditions controlling both processes are mainly 
resident in the cells themselves. (The changes, however, V, 
which lead up to the final form of the body do not occur 
continuously, but are periodic, and the rate at which the
-P-A-G-E-42

‘ growth processes go on diminishes from the first. With 
their cessation begins the period of decay. 
Starting with these ideas as introductory to the study 
of growth, a few words may be devoted to an outline of 
the manner in which it is proposed to apply and expand 
them. The arrangement is determined by the wish to 
focus on the question of brain growth as many groups of 
facts as will lead to the better comprehension of it. The 
growth of the entire body is therefore first to be studied, 
and then, since the different tissue systems are mutually 
interdependent, such facts as bear on them separately 
will be introduced. /In the skeleton it is the growth of 
the skull which is important for our purpose, since it 
_exercises a direct influence upon the enclosed brain) 
We naturally pass from this to the growth of the brain 
itself, and the conditions which more directly modify it. 
(Of course with it the spinal cord must be considered, as 
together they form a unit, the Central Nervous System.) 
The normal brain first claims attention, and we shall 
begin by discussing from the statistical point of view its 
average weight and size; but since the brain is the 
main object in this study, it seems justifiable also to 
introduce some of the facts concerning its abnormal 
development. This will enable us to estimate in a 
measure the value of those speculations which involve 
the assumption that the delinquent and dependent 
classes in modern socicty are largely the victims of 
their own nervous organisation. The facts, however, up 
to this point have been gathered entirely from observa- 
tions made on the organ taken as a whole, and their 
interpretation will become much more evident after 
considering the meaning of the size, number, and 
general arrangement of the elements, of which the 
central nervous system is composed, for the nerve cell 
stands in the same relation to the system of which it is

an element as the individual man does to the social 
organism. The architectural arrangement of these cells 
is orderly, and must be realised, both for the better 
understanding of the relations existing between the 
different portions of the nervous system and the body 
which. it controls, as well as that the important fact of 
the localisation of function in different portions of the 
system may be intelligently discussed. Having pre- 
sented the available facts under this head, the study of 
the different functions of the several portions of this 
system, or the study of localisation in the nerve centres, 
will be undertaken. This completes the anatomical side 
of the subject, and the remaining chapters deal mainly 
with physiological problems. 
It is desirable at the start to understand the 
manner in which the nerve cells react, and the 
laws controlling the habits and rhythms, of which 
they are capable. Of many of these processes we 
are conscious, but, fortunately for us, there are also 
many of which we are quite uninformed. Naturally all 
reactions induce fatigue, followed by repose, which 
permits recuperation. In this rhythm of fatigue and 
recovery there are wide individual variations, and in 
considering these variations we get a glimpse of tem- 
perament. Finally there is a point in the history of the 
individual when, both mentally and physically, the 
capacity to feel and to act diminishes. The failure is 
not necessarily equivalent in all directions, but there are 
certain general features in these changes which it is 
important to describe. With this foundation of anatomy 
and physiology the significance of training and educa- 
tional methods may be properly considered, and as a 
division of this general topic it may not be amiss to 
add a word concerning sex in education. Finally the 
attempt will be made to summarise the facts most

important for the best understanding of the form and 
function of the human central nervous system, and its 
changes during growth, presenting the wider view, and 
showing the more general bearings of the observations 
which have been discussed. 
Note to p. 37.—In cases of “ sporadic cretinism ”—arrested 
bodily: and mental development, associated with the atrophy of 
the thyroid gland—thyroid-feeding has produced in some instances 
a remarkable increase in stature together with corresponding 
mental improvement. Under such treatment a boy of nine years 
grew four and one quarter inches in height in eight months, and 
at the same time showed mental improvement. Similarly another 
boy of nineteen years grew four and one half inches within a year. 
The thyroid-feeding appears to supply some substance needed for 
growth, but lacking in these individuals. Vzde Thomson, Edin.

UNDER the term growth are included several sets of 
changes which should be distinguished. In following 
a mammal from birth to the completion of its individual 
existence, a constant series of alterations in its physical 
characters is to be noted. From infancy to maturity 
the animal increases in all diameters and in weight. 
To these physical changes the term growth has com- 
monly been limited. But after reaching maturity there is 
a period when the changes become very slow, and this is 
later followed. by the involutionary processes of old age. 
The second and third acts are as important a part of the 
life cycle as the first, and yet in the last the physical 
changes are predominantly those of decrease. The 
possibilities of confusion do not, however, end here. 
Both the size and weight of the animal may vary by 
alterations in the amount of fat, and yet such variations 
do not, strictly speaking, belong to the phenomena of 
45 
   
-P-A-G-E-46
  46 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
growth, any more than does the increase in stature 
which occurs each day during the hours of sleep. 
Moreover, to the term growth, implying increase in size, 
there is usually attached the notion of an increase in 
power and capacity for work which are qualitative 
changes. The word growth, therefore, has certain dis- 
advantages, by virtue of its several connotations, so that 
it will be better to employ, so far as possible, other terms 
intended to be more exact. wa 
Between the first changes in the fertilised ovum, and 
the somatic death of the individual, is comprised a life 
cycle. Within this cycle we recognise the following 
subdivisions: the embryonic period, when the organs 
are being formed; the fcetal period, between the 
formation of organs and the time of birth ; infancy, the 
period of dependence upon the mother—in medical 
jurisprudence extending to the time when the milk 
teeth begin to be shed—childhood, from the beginning 
of independence to the age of puberty ; youth, from 
puberty to the completion of the increase in both stature 
and weight ; maturity, from the completion of growth 
to the onset of uncompensated decay ; old age, from 
the beginning of uncompensated decay to death. Much 
stress must not be placed upon any such division, since 
it is only an attempt to break up a really continuous 
process, an attempt which can never be satisfactory, but 
which has its apology in convenience, and in the fact that 
it defines some useful terms. Within the life cycle and 
its periods cells undergo first increase, then decrease 
in size, weight, and number. These may be designated 
as growth changes. At the same time adaptive altera- 
tions take place in cell structure and constitution, and 
these are the changes of development. The term 
development, then, will be used when changes in the 
arrangements or chemical constitution of the cell sub-

stances are implied, changes which are qualitative, as 
contrasted with those evidently quantitative. After 
the cells in the nervous system have developed in some 
measure, they enter into relations with one another, 
which are closer than those between the undeveloped 
cells. The establishment of these relations constitutes 
the organisation of the system—a change by which 
not only the strength, but also the complexity and 
precision of its reactions are all increased. As a 
matter of fact, both qualitative and quantitative modi- ! 
fications go hand in hand, so that the distinction thus 
made is merely formal. It will be possible to study 
the growth of the central nervous system with a greater 
advantage if the principal facts relating to the growth 
of the entire body are first passed in review, and to 
this task we now turn. 
The elements of the human body while growing are 
continually undergoing chemical variations, which in 
turn tend to cause variations in their specific gravity. It 
is, therefore, to be remarked, that so far as the change 
in the weight of man is concerned, variation in chemical 
composition plays but an unimportant ré/e. Taking 
the body as a whole, the tissues of infants possess the 
greater, those of the aged the smaller percentage of 
water. For the foetus of one month Fehling' gives the 
percentage of water as 97°5 per cent. At birth this 
falls to'74°7 per cent. Bischoff found it to be 66:4 per 
cent. at birth, whereas in an adult it was only 58°5 per 
cent. of the weight of the body. The discrepancy between 
these two determinations of water at birth is merely an 
expression of the wide variations in this relation. When, 
however, the separate organs of the new-born and aged 
are compared in detail, it is by no means the case that 
in each instance the percentage of water in the new-

born is the greater ; the total difference is thérefore the 
algebraic sum of two opposite tendencies, causing a loss 
of water from some of the tissues, and an increase of it in 
others. From the comparative constancy of the specific

gravity after the first years of life it follows that in 
measuring the increase of the entire body, the increase 
in weight and in volume will be very nearly the same. 
The study of growth by weighing furnishes the best 
measure of the total changes of the body. It is easy to

INCREASE IN THE WEIGHT OF THE ENTIRE BODY. 49 
see why this measure should be best, if we consider for 
a moment the significance of linear measurements 
which are sometimes taken in place of it. Our 
bodies are developed in three dimensions, and give an 
irregular geometrical form which, moreover, changes 
with age. In consequence of this, the variation in any 
linear measure, as stature, for instance, serves only as a 
rough index of the changes which have taken place 
in the other two diameters. /The accompanying figure, 
taken from Langer,’ shows at a glance that a man is not 
a big child, for when the child is enlarged to the size of 
a man, as in this illustration, its short legs, large trunk, 
and enormous head are in sharp contrast with the same 
parts in the adult. ) 
This change in geometrical form is well exemplified 
by a citation from Thoma.? Starting with the figures 
of Quetelet, he makes the following tabulation :—

If we take now the specific gravity of the entire body

3 As the specific gravity of almost all the solid and fluid con- 
stituents of the body is more than 1, it is at first sight curious that 
the entire body should have a specific gravity below 1. These 
observations were, however, made on intact bodies, the air and 
gases remaining in the cavities. Hence the lower figures which 
were obtained. As the relative specific gravity is here the point 
of interest, the peculiarity of the absolute figures need not be 
further discussed.

1686+ 500=3°37 fold, and the volume of the body 
71:08 + 3'44=20°66 fold. If during this period of thirty 
years the geometrical relations at birth had persisted, 
the increase in volume of the body would have been 
proportional to the cube of the increase in stature, but 
the cube of 3°37 is 38:27, which is almost twice as much 
as the increase in volume which has been observed. It 
is thus shown that the geometric relations existing at 
birth must change during the progress of growth. For 
this reason the study of stature, important as it is, does 
not furnish data from which the changes in ‘the entire 
body can be inferred except in a most general way. 
In dealing with the data relating to change in weight, 
some care must be exercised in selection of the observa- 
tions to be employed as standards. Of course, since the 
different races of mankind differ widely in their final 
weight, and probably in the details of the manner in which 
they attain it, the individuals who are to be tested by 
reference to achosen standard, should be compared only 
with data derived from the study of those belonging to 
the same race and growing up under conditions as 
nearly similar as it is possible to have them. There have 
been already gathered in Denmark, Germany, Sweden, 
England, Russia, and the United States, a very large 
number of observations on the weights of school-children 
at different ages. These observations are unfortunately 
limited in range to the school ages, viz., from about 
four to twenty years, and thus leave out the important 
years before four and after twenty, the record for which 
it is desirable to have in order to compare, from birth 
to maturity, the growth of the central nervous system 
with that of the body. For the following discussion 
it seems best to employ but a single series of observa- 
tions, and for this purpose those on the general popula- 
tion of Great Britain published by Roberts have been

selected.1 These observations have been chosen in 
preference to some others because of their range, and 
their special applicability to English-speaking people. 
They are those employed by Galton in his Life History 
Album. Table 2 gives the figures for the average 
weight of persons between birth and twenty-four years.

The accompanying Fig. 9 expresses the facts of the

In order to correct the weight for clothing, the obser-

If the construction of the chart is understood, it will 
be seen that the records of increase, both in weight and 
stature, show that the absolute increase from year to 
year is not the same ; for were it so, the lines indicating 
increase would be straight. As a matter of fact, they 
are sinuous, thus indicating variations in rate. The 
greater the annual increase, the more nearly the record 
approaches the vertical, and the slower it is, the more 
horizontal becomes the curve, Glancing at the curve for 
the males, it is seen that for the first year of life increase 
in weight is rapid. This is followed by a period of 
slower increase up to seven years of age. From here 
the weight increases again more rapidly up to sixteen 
years, with a maximum rate between sixteen and seven- 
teen years. The rate then falls to twenty-five years, and 
from that time on, if the curve were continued up to fifty 
years, the increase would be slight, although continuous. 
In this later period, from twenty-five years onwards, 
the accumulation of body-fat is the chief cause of the

increase in weight just noted. On comparing the curve 
for the females with that for the males, by far the most 
striking feature is the similarity of the two. This is the 
more to be emphasised as in the further discussion it is 
the points of difference which will be specially described. 
The curve for the weight of the females follows that for 
the males very closely up to the sixteenth year ; at that 
time there commences a divergence which is most 
important, and which leaves the females during the 
remaining years of life some 25 lbs. or more behind 
the males. This divergence is brought about by a 
period of more vigorous growth in the males between 
the fifteenth and eighteenth years. 
But before reaching this point of final separation, 
there are in these curves at least three features of great 
interest. Both curves start at birth from almost the 
same point, that for the male, however, being slightly 
higher, thus indicating that at birth the male infant is 
heavier. Up to the end of the first year the curves 
diverge rapidly, and since the steeper curve indicates 
the greater absolute increment, we see at once that the 
male has grown more during this time. From this point 
to the tenth year the two curves diverge much more 
slowly, running at times quite parallel to one another. 
About the eleventh year the curve for the female becomes 
more perpendicular, The curve for the male still con- 
tinues at the same angle as before, and the result is, 
that at the twelfth year, or a little later, the curves 
converge, and, being close together, that for the females 
crosses that for the males. From this point to the 
sixteenth year the girls are heavier than the boys. 
This second period is closed, as the curve for the female 
becomes more horizontal and that for the male more 
perpendicular, so that they again cross. Beyond this 
is the wide divergence already described. In both the
-P-A-G-E-55
  
  INCREASE IN THE WEIGHT OF THE ENTIRE BODY. 55 
males and females there are, then, two principal periods 
of acceleration in weight increase. The first is observed 
in both sexes in the years immediately following birth, 
and is most marked during the first year. At the tenth 
year weight increase in the female is accelerated for the 
second time, and later the curve for the female crosses 
that for the male. As indicated on these curves this 
acceleration lasts for about four years. The accelera- 
tion in the male does not begin until a year or two 
later, but is greater than in the female, and lasts for a 
longer time. It therefore appears that the female 
exhibits the second acceleration somewhat earlier in 
life, and for a shorter time; and by reason of this there 
occurs the curious convergence of the two curves, a 
feature which all careful statistics on the growth of 
children show. 
The relations just described are illustrated in another 
way by the curves of Stephenson given in Fig. 10,! curves 
which are based on the observations by Bowditch as well 
as those by Roberts. They show the annual absolute 
increase in weight for the two sexes. 
Returning to the statistics by Roberts, it becomes 
evident that the information to be derived from them 
fails somewhat in explicitness because they have been 
formed by weighing and measuring many children at 
different ages, and not following the growth of in- 
dividuals through the entire period of years. While 
in a large way the “ general” and “individual” methods, 
as they have been called respectively, give similar results, 
yet there are some details in which they necessarily 
differ. Different children do not undergo the pre-pubertal 
acceleration in growth between the same ages, and while 
in the case of boys, as shown by the general method, 
it may begin even before the eleventh year, and

the general method. It is also perfectly clear that the 
number of observations on which the first part of the 
curve is based, is too small; and that the course of 
the curve for the first five years is not nearly so well 
determined as for the next twenty. So, too, the different 
classes in the community are not proportionately repre- 
sented at the different ages, and another slight error is 
thus introduced, but on the principal points these data 
are sufficiently accurate. 
The differences in individual growth are dependent 
on a variety of other conditions. It has often been 
observed that illness retards the growth of children, and 
that on recovery from illness there is a tendency to recover 
the weight and stature which should normally have 
been attained; hence just after illness the child may 
grow with unusual rapidity. These facts are admirably 
illustrated by Fig. 11, taken from K. Vierordt, where in 
one case Y and Y’, pneumonia causes the increase in 
stature to cease and weight to be lost, and in Z, a slight 
bronchitis prevents for a short time any gain in weight. 
The younger the child the more readily the recupera- 
tion is accomplished. Although external conditions 
have but a slight influence on the general course of the 
growth curve, yet the specially favoured classes in 
England and the United States are plainly above the 
average of the community in both weight and-stature. 
At the same time it is hardiy proper to assume that

meters. For those not familiar with the metric system, the 
following equivalents are given :—

surrounding conditions are here the sole factor deter- 
mining the difference. The Indians of North America 
living on the mountains are smaller than those living 
on the plains, a correlation which may be associated 
with the greater abundance of food on the plains.t But 
under like conditions half-breeds tend to be taller than 
their parents,and havea slightly different curve of growth,? 
here again indicating that much must be allowed to the 
peculiarities of the species on which any set of external 
conditions happens to be acting. Further, Boas has 
found that first-born children are, in the end, taller and 
heavier than others of the same family.3 We are aware of 
no conditions compatible with life in which the general 
character of the growth curve with its acceleration 
during adolescence can be altered. Minor varia- 
tions may, however, arise. From a study of the 
relations of the curves for the two sexes under varying 
conditions, it appears (Roberts’ Tables) that the environ- 
ment has more influence on the male than on the female, 
and that under the most favourable conditions the two 
curves run more nearly parallel owing to the better 
growth of the males; but the cause of this may be 
sociological rather than strictly biological. 
The weight of the individual at any period of 
development must be looked upon as one factor 
influencing further growth. Mohring found that the 
loss of weight4 occurring in infants during the first few 
days of life was more marked in those whose weight at 
birth was small. Bowditch. and also Porter,o have

sought to determine in school-children the significance 
for subsequent growth of the size already attained. The 
determination is, however, extremely difficult, since the 
small children are not necessarily transformed into small 
adults, nor is the small child at one age necessarily the 
small child at the next period in its growth.t 
While the statistics on weight just presented may be 
all that are needful for our present purposes, it would 
also be of value to know the course of weight increase 
before birth. The table here given is compiled from 
observations gathered by Vierordt.?

This shows ae how enormous is the increase in 
weight during the first three-quarters of a year. From 
‘0006 grms. to 3250 grms. is an increase of more than five 
million fold, so that compared with this later growth is 
a very feeble performance. The weight of the child at 
birth is the resultant of several modifying conditions. 
Minot 3 has brought together the data on this point, 
and his facts are here summarised. The size of the child 
is correlated with the size of the mother. Gassner states 
that the average weight of the child is 5°23 per cent. of 
the maternal weight. It is also found that the heaviest 
children are born to mothers aged about thirty-five years.

  62 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. t 
This may be a result of age alone or may be complicated 
by the fact that previous pregnancies tend to increase 
the weight of the last born child. To these conditions 
are also to be added the length/of gestation and individual 
differences in the growing power of the foetus, on both of. 
which the foregoing conditions must exert an influence. 
A record for growth during the first year of life is 
given from Vierordt after Meeh.t This shows the rapid 
increase in weight, which, with the exception of an 
insignificant regression during the twenty-first week, is 
continuous. (Fig. 12.) 
The rate of growth has already been mentioned, and 
it will be important to determine for man the rate of the 
increase in weight. The facts at first sight do not 
arrest the attention, but when we stop to consider, it is 
plain that there must be both variations, and also a 
great diminution in the rate, similar to that pointed 
out by Minot in his study of guinea-pigs. If the weight 
of the body at any date be taken as a basis, the per- 
centage increase on this figure during the next unit of time 
can be calculated, and so on for any number of succes- 
sive intervals. Treating in this manner the figures for 
the increase in weight, as given by Roberts, they yield 
a curve as shown in Fig. 13, where from birth to the 
first year there has been an increase in weight of 240 
per cent. for the males, and 190 per cent. in the females. 
But this rate diminishes during the succeeding years 
with astonishing rapidity. 
' This curve indicates that the weight increase which 
we measure between birth and maturity may be re- 
garded as the latter end of a dwindling capability, in 
which there is a slight revival at the age of puberty, 
a revival representing the last strong impulse in the 
direction of enlargement.

  64 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
The mystery of this running down of the animal 
machine awaits explanation, though of course the 
mechanical hindrances to nutrition following increase in 
bulk, and the greater exertion necessary to obtain food 
after .separation from the mother, have long been 
recognised. There is, however, something beyond 
mechanics in the problem. Indeed there is some 
ground for considering each animal as possessed of a 
certain limited store of potential energy with which to 
go through its life, but the complexity of the manner 
in which this energy may be expended is so great, and 
the combinations of its expression so manifold, that as 
yet it is possible only in the most general way to guess 
at the capacity of a given individual. We admit that 
disease is fundamentally exhausting, that excessive 
exertion and privation leave an indelible mark on the 
bodily organism, and yet there is so much art in the 
manner of putting forth exertion, that at present we aie 
quite without means to adequately record its expendi- 
ture, or to explain how structural deficiencies may be 
masked, for the measure of the whole man is neither the 
number of pounds that he can lift, nor facts that he can 
discover, nor the influence that he can exert upon his 
fellows, nor yet the age to which he can attain, but 
something of all these and what they stand for, taken 
together.

THE observations contained in the previous chapter 
relate to the entire body, while here I shall introduce 
facts bearing on some of its anatomical subdivisions. 
For the purpose of this further study the entire body 
may be resolved into the group of tissue systems which 
compose it. Indeed it is almost necessary to approach 
the subject in this way, because the different tissues, 
of which the nervous system is one example, are so 
mutually dependent upon one another for the manner 
in which they develop, that important modifying 
conditions are overlooked, when any one system is 
considered alone. 
Histologists recognise in the body a series of struc- 
tural elements, designated as epithelial, connective, 
nervous, and muscular. From these, combined in 
varying proportions, are built up the different organs 
c 6: 5 Ss

  of the body, which may again be ranged in larger 
groups or systems. The bony skeleton is connective 
tissue, rendered rigid by a deposit of lime-salts. The 
system of the voluntary or skeletal muscles is predomi- 
nantly composed of muscular tissue ; while in the case 
of the nervous system this dominance of characteristic 
tissue is even more marked. 
Within the thoracic and abdominal cavities of the 
body are the several viscera, and these last may be 
removed -and_ studied separately. What remains 
after their removal is the skeleton enclosed by 
the muscles, and in turn enclosing the central nervous 
system, the whole mass being covered by the skin. 
By proper methods these several portions may be 
separated from one another. The facts obtained by 
such a separation are in part shown in the following 
table on the weight and composition of the human body, 
as given by Bischoff * :—

   WEIGHT INCREASE AND INCREASE IN STATURE. 67 
In this table let us first consider the figures relating 
to the male child and to the man. On comparing the 
proportion of the different systems in the new-born with 
the adult, the following relations are worthy of remark : 
the percentage of the skeleton, fat and skin, taken 
together, is but slightly srmaller in the new-born. The 
percentage of the viscera in the new-born is nearly 
twice, that of the central nervous system more than 
eight times, that found in the adult, whereas the pro- 
portional weight of the muscles shows only a trifle more 
than one-half its adult value. The purely constructional 
parts of the body, the skeleton, fat and skin, which are 
also formed predominantly of connective tissue, have 
therefore not varied their proportion during growth ; 
while the nutritive and controlling system, that is, the 
abdominal and thoracic viscera and the brair 
undergone « relative diminution, having jn~a ¥ 
remarkable way bet oug-rowWtr nr systet 
On comparing the female child with tie woman, 
most of the preceding statements might be repeated. 
On comparing the two sexes it is found that the in- 
crease in the proportion of the muscles is less marked 
in the woman than in the man, while the increase in the 
fat is greater. Indeed in both the female child and the 
woman the percentage of fat is high as compared with 
the other sex. 
On considering the new-born child, we are impressed by 
the fact that the great vegetative system represented by 
the viscera of the trunk is in early life of proportionally 
large bulk. Since with advancing age the constructive 
processes become slower and finally cease, the duty of 
maintenance being alone performed, it may be inferred 
that the demands on this system made by the enlarging 
muscles soon match its powers of performance. With 
a slight change of terms, the relations of the central

     68 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
   nervous system to the body at large may be similarly 
described. That a normal relation between growing 
parts and the central system is necessary to their mutual 
development is certain; but whether through the nerves 
the part under control directly receives anything more 
than the stimuli which keep it in a state of healthful

Here are recorded the weight changes in the brain, 
heart, right lung, and left lung, kidneys (taken together), 
the spleen, and the entire body. The averages for the 
several organs are derived from observations on the 
different cases, so that the individuals from whom the 
liver was weighed are, for example, not always 
individuals from whom the brain also was weighed.
-P-A-G-E-71
WEIGHT INCREASE AND INCREASE IN STATURE. 71 
The figures for the males show the liver to be ultimately 
the heaviest organ, and the brain next in weight, 
although at birth the brain is by far the bulkiest of the 
entire group. It is found, however, that its relative 
growth is less,and very much less, than that of the 
other organs, and as one consequence the percentage 
decrease in the weight value of the brain is the greatest. 
The growth of the brain is most rapid during the first 
year. It will not escape notice that the maximum 
_ weight reached by the brain occurs in the table (in heavy 
type) for the males at fifteen years, and in that for the 
females, at ten years. This peculiarity will be discussed 
later on, and here it only need be remarked that there is 
no evidence for the view that in a given individual the 
brain at this period is heavier than it is during the next 
two decades. The most rapid weight increase of the- 
other organs centres about the time of _guberty, and 
tends to precece-the ameeniftinWeiek increase for the 
entire body ; suggesting, therefore, that the muscular 
system is the last to respond. The relative growth of 
the left lung approaches most nearly that of the body as 
a whole, while the liver shows the greatest acceleration 
at puberty. Thus far, what has been said of the males 
applies to the females also. 
There are a number of points, however, in which they 
differ. In the female at birth the brain, heart, right 
lung, and spleen are recorded as heavier than in the 
male, although the total body-weight is less. Both the 
relative and absolute increase in the male is greater for 
every organ except the spleen, while the percentage of 
the total body-weight as represented by those organs at 
maturity is less in all instances. The increase in the 
liver at puberty is most marked in the female. If we 
bring these facts together, it appears that the brain 
grows in a manner different from the viscera of the 
  y, 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
    72 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
trunk, and that these latter more nearly follow the body- 
weight, though in the case of all, except the left lung, 
they fail to keep pace with it. Further, the acceleration 
of growth at puberty appears earlier in the female 
and the percentage value of the viscera is greater. 
Owing to the smaller development of the muscular 
system in the female, this percentage relation is 
intelligible. 
By way of criticism, it must be admitted that the 
original observations used in forming these tables were 
not homogeneous, and that for the most part the 
observations were made on persons belonging to the least 
favoured social classes. Further, that in view of the 
period covered, the number of observations for each 
organ is by no means large; yet, despite these evident 
-.deficiencies, there is reason to believe that the pecu- 
liarities here noted have a general significance. 
Passing next 4@fier omamination, of the-increase in 
weight and size of the organs, as dependent on changes 
in their constituent elements, it will be necessary first to 
inquire whether, with the enlargement of the whole 
organ during this interval, the constituent elements 
increase in size only or in number also. For this 
inquiry the two methods of enlargement should be 
clearly understood. In describing abnormal growths, 
the pathologists employ the term hypertrophy, with the 
connotation that the enlargement thus designated is due 
solely to the increase in the size of the elements already 
formed. On the other hand, the term hyperplasia is 
used to indicate enlargement dependent on the formation 
of new cell elements. These terms are also convenient 
in distinguishing the two modes of normal growth. 
Taking the elementary tissues as previously enumerated, 
it is found that after birth the epithelial tissues in 
various localities are being continuously renewed though
-P-A-G-E-73
  WEIGHT INCREASE AND INCREASE IN STATURE. 73 
not increased, and that the connective tissues certainly 
exhibit hyperplasic increase throughout life. In the 
muscular system it is the unstriped muscles in which 
the tendency to hyperplasic growth is most marked and 
continuous ; while this form of growth is not known to 
occur after birth among the nervous elements. 
Should we be willing to take a suggestion from 
pathology, it would be a fair inference that those 
systems or organs in which hyperplasic growth was 
normally most marked, and continued through the 
longest time, would be the ones in which pathological 
forms of this process most frequently appear. The 
facts will, I believe, bear out such generalisation. 
The epithelia of the body surfaces are very variable, 
and adjust themselves to new conditions with ease. 
Within limits they regenerate, as in the case of small 
wounds, in the course of glandular activity and the 
like. Of the examples of hypesplisic activity of 
connective tissue there would simply be no end, should 
an enumeration of instances be attempted. In many 
ways this least specialised of the tissues, possessing in a 
high degree the power of hyperplasic growth on slight 
stimulation, stands in the mammals not only as the 
prime element in all bodily repair, but as ever ready to 
assert its capability for increase even to the detriment of . 
the organism as a whole. In many cases, no sooner 
does one of the specialised tissues grow weak and lose 
the control which each healthy cell-group exerts on its 
neighbours, than it becomes at once more or less over- 
grown by these vigorous but comparatively unspecialised 
connective tissue cells. The vascular and alimentary 
systems, together with the uterus during gestation, are 
the seats of the hyperplasic increase of unstriped muscular 
tissue. In the heart it is more difficult to determine the 
part which hyperplasia plays in the overgrowth, but so far
-P-A-G-E-74
  74 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
as the skeletal muscles are concerned, hyperplasic growth 
as a normal occurrence is generally denied. Certain it 
is that ordinary exercise fails to increase the bulk of 
the muscles after a comparatively early period—namely, 
the twenty-fifth year, or the probable time of the cessa- 
tion of growth, and that during the growing period the 
increase in weight is largely if not entirely the result of 
an increase in the size of the original fibres. If we are 
to judge from the activities of those elements, which by 
division give rise to the nerve cells, it is at a time some 
months before birth that the hyperplasic growth in the 
central nervous system of man terminates. But in 
attempting thus to sharply separate these two processes 
a false idea must not be conveyed. Strictly interpreted, 
hyperplasia implies the formation of new cells. Yet at 
birth, and for a long time after, many systems contain 
cell cleriggpts which are more or less immature, not 
forming a funct#e"al part of the tissue, and yet under 
some conditions capable of further development. The 
changes caused by the continued growth of these cells 
are not, strictly speaking, to be classed under either of 
the two heads just given, although for practical 
purposes organs enlarging in this way may be con- 
sidered as undergoing hyperplasic increase. 
It is evident- from this brief survey how complex a 
process increase in weight may be: it may be due to a 
swelling of the cells already functional, the develop- 
ment of immature cells, or the production of new cells, 
and these processes may be combined in any proportion, 
while accompanying them in every organ is a variable 
increase in the connective tissue framework and the 
system of nutritive channels. 
Associated with the study of these changes are two 
statistical difficulties of some importance. The obser- 
vations based on the weight of portions of the body are
-P-A-G-E-75
  WEIGHT INCREASE AND INCREASE IN STATURE. 75 
made, and must necessarily be made, on the dead. So 
far as non-accidental causes of death are concerned, the 
anatomical peculiarities of the person dying are probably 
an important factor in causing death, for there can be 
no doubt that persons, the relation of whose various 
systems and organs are dissimilar, do also present 
different degrees of resistance to attacking disease or 
mechanical strains. An example of the latter is the 
observation by Boyd, that still-born children have 
heavier brains and larger heads than those born living, 
a result to be explained by the fact that under the 
mechanical conditions of birth a large head in the 
child is distinctly a disadvantageous variation. The 
dead, therefore, representing those individuals least well 
organised, form one series, and the living anether. 
Where growth is very rapid, as in the lungs, slight 
variations may be obscured, and nrobable@the curve 
from the dead does not materially mMléad us as to the 
changes taking place in the living ; but when we find 
that among the males in the table before us the average 
brain-weights are heavier at fifteen and twenty years 
than they are at twenty-five years, and among the 
females the same is true, with the addition that it holds 
at ten years also, the question at once arises whether 
there are here simply misleading figures, or whether the 
records are significant. Since other series of observa- 
tions on the weight of the brain show the same 
pre-maxima, we can feel fairly certain that their occur- 
rence is more than accidental. The social status of 
the persons on whom these. observations were made 
was essentially similar at all periods, and the variation 
cannot therefore be explained by a change in that con- 
dition. . Furthermore, this feature occurs in the statistics 
for both sexes, and, as we have noted, in the females 
at an earlier date than in the males. The suggestion
-P-A-G-E-76
  76 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
is at least plausible that in these cases. a premature 
growth of the brain has been one factor in causing 
death. i 
These facts can perhaps be taken as examples of the 
danger attending the deviation from the mean in the 
construction of a body, for in the case of the brain, as 
in that of any other organ or system, undue development 
weakens the entire individual, and so the facts derived 
from necropsies are to be applied to the history of living 
individuals only after proper correction. In connection 
with this last point the mortality records may be cited. 
Observations have shown that the percentage of deaths 
in the population at large varies with age, being high 
in the first years of childhood and in old age, and low 
in the middle years. These relations are expressed in 
Fig. 14. 
The curyg just given needs perhaps a word of explana- 
tion. It was defMoped by Hensen on the basis of 
Bockh’s tables of mortality, which tables depended on 
Prussian statistics for the years 1865-6." The tables are 
based on the assumption of a population of one million 
individuals, of the various ages. from 0 to 100 years, 
The number of deaths occurring among those of a 
given age is represented as a percentage. The portion 
of the curve before 0 years represents the percentage 
of prematurely still-born children. It is easy to see 
~ that, while the rate of mortality at birth is very high 
indeed, it rapidly sinks until about the fifth year, 
when it has fallen to the neighbourhood of 1 per cent. 
From this age it rises slowly for the next sixty years, 
and finally very rapidly. An explanation of this is to 
be found by considering both how the body is built up 
and how it breaks down. 
That the body is a house is a simile coming down to 
* Hensen, Hermann’s Handbuch der Physiologie, 1881.

WEIGHT INCREASE AND INCREASE IN STATURE. 77 
us from the remotest antiquity, but we may enlarge 
upon it. Like a house, it is intended to resist destruc- 
tion from the outside influences always acting upon it. 
If we interpret this mortality curve as an expression of 
the perfection of the bodily house, we find that during

Bockh, 1876. The curve is intended to show the percentage

logte.) 
the first five years of life, when, to extend the simile, the 
materials are in the process of being put together and 
adjusted to one another, the house offers but a small
-P-A-G-E-78
  78 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
resistance to the forces which attack it. As we depart 
from the initial stages the more consolidated becomes 
the bodily structure, and the nearer the approach to a 
satisfactory modus vivendi. For a period of fifty-five 
years, from the age of five years onward, there is a strong 
and steady withstanding of these influences which had 
previously been so fatal. After this time ruin sets in, 
and the structural elements fall apart. From this there 
is no possible escape, for the good building material of 
sixty years before has in a large measure lost its strength 
and becomes rapidly less fit for the purposes of life. 
Returning with these facts to the statistics for the 
weight of the entire body, derived by the general 
method, we see that account must have been taken of 
both those individuals who will successfully grow during 
the first five years and those who will not, whereas 
the later observations are made on those among whom 
the death-rate is much diminished. The character of 
the data, then, for the first five years of life is particularly 
heterogencous. 
At the latter end of the curves for increase both in 
weight and stature there is also a difficulty of import- 
ance. As regards weight, it is almost impossible in the 
years after twenty-five to determine when the proper 
growth ceases, and when increase in weight becomes due 
to the accumulation of body-fat, a habit in which different 
persons vary widely. Yet however strong may be the 
inclination to scorn fat as an ignoble tissue, and a disturb- 
ing factor in the proper study of growth, it is neverthe- 
less not without its significance. The chubbiness of 
infancy, the lankness of youth, and the roundness of 
maturity are all normal phases of the body. From the 
physician’s point of view this relation has been studied 
by Stephenson, whose curves for the absolute increase 
in weight were given in the last chapter ; also it ‘has
-P-A-G-E-79
WEIGHT INCREASE AND INCREASE IN STATURE. 79 
been pointed out by Macauley* that in granting life 
insurance there is an increased risk if a person of given 
age and stature falls below a proportionate body-weight, 
for in such a case some morbid process, perhaps other- 
wise unrecognised, is at least to be suspected. In stature, 
too, it is very difficult to say when growth actually 
ceases, because possible correlations between stature and 
length of life come in to obscure the result. Baxter found 
in men an increase in stature up to the thirty-fifth year.2 
It would be most natural to interpret growth pro- 
cesses as a genuine expression of bodily vigour, and it 
might be expected that during the period of growth the 
death-rate therefore would be small. We see from the 
mortality curve just examined that during the very 
active growing period of the first five years of life the 
mortality is comparatively high, but at that time, as we 
know, there are not only the active processes of enlarge- 
ment, but also the necessary adaptation of the several 
systems to one another, and of the body as a whole to 
its environment. Should the term vigour be expanded 
to mean the capacity for the successful performance of 
all these processes, then the above interpretation would 
be admissible. Passing on to that period of growth 
which is associated with adolescence, it is shown by the 
observations of Key 3 that just after this has begun the 
percentage of illnesses among school-children decreases, 
and that the general health of scholars in Sweden is 
best during the middle of this period. With the cessa- 
tion of the active growth the percentage of illness again 
rapidly rises. 
The facts relating to stature are ‘by no means as 
important for us as those bearing on body-weight,

but at the same time they possess much interest. 
Stature is mainly dependent on changes in the bony 
skeleton, or, to express it in a still more general way, in 
the connective tissue framework. In making measure- 
ments of it, then, we are following changes which take 
place in one of the great tissue systems of the body.

    WEIGHT INCREASE AND INCREASE IN STATURE. 81 
When stature is considered we find that the curve by 
which its increase is measured is in general similar to 
the curve for increase in weight, and that relations 
similar to those found for weight subsist between the 
curves for the twosexes. The most important difference 
between these two sets of measurements is that the 
periods of most rapid increase in stature precede those 
for weight. The increase in stature is due primarily 
to a lengthening of the skeleton in the line of its long 
axis ; while the enlargement of the mass of muscles is 
especially connected with the increase in other diameters. 
At first glance it might appear that this growth in the 
long axis of the body occurs in the line im which gravity 
acts most strongly during the hours of activity, yet it is 
probable that the principal increase in stature occurs at 
night, during repose, when the long axis is horizontal. 
Moreover, the general impression to be gathered from 
the observations of other animals, and even of plants, 
is that where there exists a distinctly indicated long 
axis, this axis is the line of first growth, the growth 
at right angles to it coming later, and that gravity is 
not a factor of importance in this connection. The 
determination of the increase in stature before birth 
is complicated by the fact that it first involves the 
trunk alone, the limbs becoming important factors only 
later, hence there is no consensus as to the time when 
they should be included in the measurement. After 
birth the rate of increase in stature is comparatively 
slow. Its final cessation is indeterminate, although it 
certainly becomes very small after the twenty-fifth year. 
Fig. 15—formed in the same manner as Fig. 13—which 
shows rate of increase in weight, indicates that since it 
is a linear measurement the rate is always slower for 
stature, and that there is less difference between the 
first and later years of life.

  82 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
All the curves which have been here presented are 
sinuous, thus indicating that periods of more rapid 
growth alternate with those in which it is slower. As 
has been pointed out, such a rhythm can be followed in 
the segmenting ovum. When the cells become more 
numerous the period of these alternations becomes 
longer. There is apparently an acceleration of growth 
processes at the sixth month of feetal life, at birth, at 
the seventh year, and at adolescence, this being the last. 
During the growth period of the healthy child it becomes

of interest to inquire how the circling seasons and re- 
volving day may influence the process. The observa- 
tions of Malling-Hansen? on Danish children from nine 
to fifteen years of age show that by far the most rapid 
increase in stature was in the third of the year between 
the middle of April and the middle of August, while 
the third of the year between the middle of August and 
the middle of December was the one in which they 
gained nine-elevenths of their annual increase in weight. 
These observations have been made, however, upon

school-children, to whom the summer season brought 
an increase in outdoor life and a respite from school 
work, as well as a change in meteorological conditions. 
Yet if season is here the important condition it follows 
that the children in the northern hemisphere have, like 
plants, a growing period the reverse of those in the 
southern ; but on this point there are as yet no observa- 
tions. The various and careful observations of Camerer? 
have shown that a child of ten years is 700 grms. 
lighter and 2 cms. taller in the morning after a night’s 
rest, and that during the day it is losing in stature and 
gaining in weight. Of course in this case not all the 
apparent gain in stature is lost during the following day, 
neither is it probable that the loss in weight at night 
reduces the total weight to the point at which it was the 
morning before, but it is extremely difficult, on account 
of the many sources of error, to directly determine these 
increments within such short intervals, and for these 
reasons we really know nothing of daily increase in 
weight or stature. With this review of general growth 
the matter must be left, in order that the more special 
questions relating to the nervous system may be taken 
up.

THE weight of the encephalon, or that portion of the 
nervous system contained within the cranium, has often 
been recorded, especially during the last century. The 
earlier observations were desultory and few in number, 
while the later ones are both more systematic, more 
accurate, and more numerous. Nevertheless very pre- 
cise results are demanded, and until still greater care is 
taken it will not be possible by increasing merely the 
number of observations to pass much beyond the stand- 
point of to-day. In his Elements of General Anthro- 
pology Topinard * has given a list of the observations on 
the weight of the brain up to the year 1885. The 
entries in the table there printed show a total of 6,035 
observations on the sane, and 4,147 on the insane. 
Since 1885 there have been recorded some 3,500 more, 
mainly on the insane, so that there now exists a grand

     total of over 13,000 observations. For the most ] 
these have been made in England and in Germany, 4 
and to a lesser extent in France, Italy, Russia, a 
Austria. 
Investigators who have weighed the brain and its 
parts have had before them several objects. The facts 
were primarily of importance to the medical profession 
, from the anatomical and anthropological point of view, 
while pathologists sought to associate different forms of 
mental disease with variations in the brain-weight and 
form. At the same time the search for a correlation 
between the size and form of the brain and the degree 
of the intelligence has interested all who have worked 
on this. organ, and although it might be designated as 
} the psychologist’s standpoint, it has, from the very first, 
been in some measure before the minds of all. To a 
statement of the observations on the physical characters 
of the central nervous system we therefore turn. 
Experiment and clinical observation have very clearly 
shown that disturbances of the encephalon are capable 
of causing disturbances of intelligence, and the study of 
the evidence justifies us in claiming the brain as the 
organ of the mind. Yet the brain is not entirely 
made up of nervous tissues, but contains other. elements 
as well. It is surrounded by’ membranes, the pia 
and dura, supported inside and out by a framework of 
supporting tissues, and penetrated in all directions by 
nutrient channels, the blood-vessels and the lymphatics. 
This mass, consisting of nervous tissues, supporting 
tissues, and nutrient vessels in various degrees of disten- 
sion, sometimes with the pia, sometimes without it, is 
the structure, the weight of which has been determined 
and recorded as that of the brain. Within the ence- 
phalon are cavities, the ventricles, and in these ventricles 
bare to be found under different conditions varying quan-

   s of fluid. When the brain is weighed with the 
tricles unopened the fluid there present is included, 
contributes to the final figure. In the examination 
of healthy brains the development of all these non- 
nervous factors, the fluids, membranes, and vessels, is 
either assumed as proportional in the several brains 
compared, or more rarely some effort is made to exclude | 
them from the result by treating them separately. The 
dura weighed 4o and 42 grammes in the two cases, a 
woman anda man, in which E. Bischoff tested it.t 
Giacomini? found under ordinary circumstances that 
the weight of the pia and residual fluid was from 5 to 
5°5 per cent. of the, total weight of the hemispheres, 
these in turn being but 87:2 per cent. of the entire 
encephalon. If the vessels were congested the propor- 
tion might rise to 65 per cent. The most complete 
observations on the absolute weight of the pial mem- 
branes is furnished by Broca.* He found that the pia 
was heavier in the male than in the female, and that its 
weight increased with age. When the subjects obtained 
from a hospital for the insane, like the Bicétre, were 
compared in this respect with those from the general 
hospitals, the pia was found to be heavier in the case 
of the insane. His table for the males is as follows:—

both of which extreme observations were made on 
brains of small weight. The mean weight of the pia in 
the case of 133 females was found to be 48°7 grammes, 
and in the case of 273 males 55°8 grammes. Th. v. 
Bischoff has determined the weight of the pia as from 
25 to 40 grammes.t In the insane Morselli? finds the 
weight of the pia and fluids to be almost double that 
found in normal persons. 
The cast of the ventricles as made by Welcker 
displaces 26 cu. cm. of water, so that the fluid filling 
such a cavity would weigh a trifle over 26 grammes. 
From these results some notion of the part played by 
the ventricular fluid and the pia is to be obtained. 
There are numerous other records relating to the dura, 
but they differ so widely that evidently they should not 
be compared with one another. V.riations in the pro- 
portion of these non-nervous constitaents can produce 
noticeable discrepancies when single brains are com- 
pared, but as soon as average weights based on series of 
twenty or more specimens are taken the disturbance 
caused by them ceases to be important. 
At one time it was my purpose to combine all 
existing data, and from the broader basis thus estab- 
lished to test the validity of conclusions current in this 
field. It soon became plain, however, that for a number 
of reasons the observations made by different observers 
using dissimilar methods and working with various 
races, were not in themselves homogeneous enough to 
bear fusing without very important corrections. It has 
therefore been deemed best to discuss the question 
before us simply by the aid of a few of the best series 
of observations.

88 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
weighing from 2°16 per cent. (male) to 2°23 per cent. 
(female) of the entire adult body. So long as it is 
intended to use these figures merely to indicate that the 
proportional weight of the brain is small, no harm is 
done, but, given the body-weight, it is quite unjustifiable 
to attempt to deduce the weight of an individual 
brain by the aid of it. A moment’s thought will 
show that the chief variable in the original determina- 
tion of the percentages was the body-weight. The 
chief variable in this proposed inference is the body- 
weight, and the variation in that figure being wide, the 
final result must be correspondingly unreliable. 
f Although the problem has been repeatedly attacked, 
jt must be admitted that there is no method of deter- 
mining with satisfactory accuracy the weight of the 
brain in the living person, so that for the present at 
least, the facts obtained by autopsies supplemented by 
the determination of the capacities of skulls, are alone 
useful. In studying the questions connected with the 
, weight of the brain it will be necessary to employ 
descriptive terms which are exact, in order to under- 
stand just what has been weighed, and a word on these 
terms is therefore in place. 
The nervous system is divided into a central and 
a peripheral portion. Since there is no natural line of 
division between these two, an arbitrary separation is 
made at the point where the nerves leave the cavity of 
the skull and vertebral column. Of the weight and 
volume of the peripheral nervous system which ramifies 
through all parts of the body, records are wanting, 
because of the difficulty in separating it from the sur- 
rounding parts. But from the cranial cavity and the 
spinal canal it is comparatively easy to remove the 
enclosed masses, and thus the brain and spinal cord 
have been weighed in various ways. To dispose first         
   
-P-A-G-E-89
  THE WEIGHT OF THE BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD. 89 
of the portion about whicn our information is most 
meagre, it may be said that we know very little concern- 
ing the physical properties of the spinal cord, a lack for 
which the comparative difficulty of obtaining the cord 
for examination is to a large extent responsible.’ It is 
always weighed after the removal of the dura, but with 
the pia adherent. It should be added, however, that the 
weight of the cord also varies with the mammer in which 
the nerves are separated from it: Since the nerves 
arising along the cord may pass for several inches 
within the canal before going through the vertebral 
foramina, it becomes possible to separate them either at 
the point where they arise from the cord or at the point 
where they enter the foramina. Having a considerable 
mass they add materially to the weight of the cord, 
which therefore varies accordingly as it is weighed with 
or without them. Occasionally the cord is farther 
divided into the portions designated as the cervical, 
thoracic, and lumbar, and these weighed separately. 
At the base of the skull the portion of the central 
nervous system within the cranium contracts to form 
the bulb, which is directly continuous with the spinal 
cord, and one of the first difficulties is to determine the 
proper point of separation between these two. The 
mere acceptance of the mass within the cranial cavity as 
the encephalon does not satisfy the conditions, because 
both the brain and the spinal cord are capable of some 
longitudinal movement, and as a result the amount 
which may be included within the cranial cavity is 
slightly variable. It has consequently become the custom 
to select as a fixed point the caudal end of that eleva- 
tion on the ventral surface of the bulb, known as the 
decussation of the pyramids, and to make the section at 
this level. The mass above this section is the ence- 
phalon. This also establishes the caudal boundary of
-P-A-G-E-90
  go THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
the bulb. Its cephalic boundary is taken at its junction 
with those great bundles of transverse fibres which form 
the pons. This region of the pons has in turn its 
anterior boundary indicated by a plane passing through 
its cephalic edge and separating it from the corpora 
quadrigemina. Between this boundary and a plane 
passing through the cephalic edge of the corpora quadri- 
gemina is cut off the fraction of the encephalon known 
as the mid brain, but it is only rarely that this portion is 
weighed alone, being usually left in connection with the 
hemispheres. The hind brain, or cerebellum, is con- 
nected on each side with the bulb, pons, and the region 
of the corpora quadrigemina. When all these connec- 
tions are cut, the cerebellum is separated, and may be 
weighed either zz ¢ofo or after further division. The 
term cerebrum is variously applied to that portion of the 
encephalon which lies in front of either the cephalic edge 
of the pons or of the corpora quadragemina, authors 
having adopted different usages. It will thus be seen that 
the weight and volume of the cerebrum must be somewhat 
greater in cases where the quadrigemina are still in con- 
nection with it. In the case of the tables from Boyd, 
which I shall present later, the term cerebrum means 
the brain mass cephalad of the quadrigemina. When 
the cerebrum is divided in the median plane, it is sepa- 
rated into two symmetrical portions, the hemispheres. 
To follow further the subdivisions which are sometimes 
made, it will suffice to consider one of the hemispheres 
alone. If the island of Reil, a sunken portion of the 
hemisphere, be exposed by turning back the opercula 
which cover it, and which are formed by the edges of the 
parietal, frontal, and temporal lobes coming together 
along the line of the Sylvian fissure, the part thus un- 
covered is seen to be bounded by a continuous sulcus. 
If a scalpel be carried through this sulcus cutting deeply, 
   
-P-A-G-E-91
  THE WEIGHT OF ‘THE BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD. 91 
the hemisphere is separated into two portions, a smaller 
basal portion composed of the basal ganglia (optic thala- 
mus and corpora striata, together with the portion of cor- 
tical substance covering the striata and forming the island) 
and the more massive enveloping portion, the mantle. 
  Fic. 16.—Showing the principal divisions of the encephalon made 
for the study of its weight :—1. Hemisphere, seen from the 
side, fissuration according to Eberstaller; 2. Mid-brain, region

together, form what is designated the “ stem” in the tables 
of Boyd. (Modified from Quain’s Anatomy.) 
The mantle consists of a central mass of white matter 
completely covered over with grey cortex. Sometimes 
the mantle is still further divided into lobes, but the 
valu ; of these subdivisions and the extent to which they 
havi Hecen employed can be best discussed when the

occasion arises. Fig. 16 is intended to show the 
principal subdivisions which have just been enumerated. 
The nerve tissue proper is composed of two portions 
distinguishable by their colour. Certain parts of the 
central and the peripheral system appear grey in colour, 
while the remaining portions are white. The white 
matter is composed chiefly of medullated nerve fibres, 
and owes its colour to their white medullary sheaths. 
The grey matter, on the other hand, contains the bodies 
of nerve cells, but fibres arising from them are pre- 
sent in large numbers, thus making the grey substance 
less homogeneous. To the relative amount of white and 
grey we shall later return. In their normal and resting 
condition both white and grey matter are alkaline in 
reaction, but after death they tend to become neutral or 
even acid. Like all the soft tissues the nervous system 
contains a large proportion of water. The tables which 
follow give the percentage of water found in the grey 
and white matter of the brain and in the spinal cord.*

another in the zoological scale. As has been previously 
explained, the white matter is more homogeneous than 
the grey, and the percentage of water in the white 
matter therefore shows the least variation. The order 
in which the animals stand in this table was determined 
by putting first the one with the smallest percentage of 
water in the grey matter of the cerebrum and letting the 
others follow in regular succession. Passing from the 
monkey tothe dog, cat, and man, the percentage of 
water increases in the other portions of the nervous 
system much as it does in the grey matter of the cere- 
brum, since the proportion of cell-bodies increases. 
In looking at the subdivisions of the spinal cord as 
made for this examination, it is to be remembered that 
proportionately the cervical and lumbar regions contain 
more grey matter than the thoracic region does, and as a 
result both those regions show the greater percentage of 
water. Since in the lumbar enlargement the proportion 
of white matter is less than in the cervical, we should 
expect, as the records show, that it would contain the 
greatest proportion of water. Using a similar method 
to that of Halliburton, De Regibus obtained in Italian 
brains the following figures, which apply, however, to 
the cortex and white matter of the cerebrum only.t

These in turn agree very closely with the observations 
made by Thudichum on English brains,t and which give:— 
Percentage of water lost at 95° C., from cortical grey matter, 
85°27 per cent; percentage of water lost at 95° C., from white 
matter of hemisphere, 70°23 per cent. 
Taken all together, these results indicate in a satisfac- 
tory way the constancy of the proportion of water in the 
parts named. The variations which occur are readily 
explained by slight differences in the localities from 
which the samples tested were obtained and by errors of 
experiment. 
Directly connected with the percentage of water is 
the specific weight of these substances. Obersteiner 2 
has made some very careful observations on the specific 
gravity of the cerebral cortex from the different portions 
of the hemispheres, and finds a striking and significant 
increase in this figure on passing from the frontal to 
the occipital lobes.

  THE WEIGHT OF THE BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD. 95 
What is still more important is the fact that the 
specific gravity of the cortex itself increases from the 
surface inwards towards the white matter, and if it be 
divided into three layers the following is found :— 
Outermost layer Ee as Specific gravity, 1:028 
Middle layer be ee 3 1034, 
Innermost layer See nie 6 1°036 
It will be seen from these figures that before the 
various records of the proportion of water in the grey 
matter of the cortex can be fairly compared more detail 
is required concerning the methods of obtaining the 
samples examined. From a selection of the best facts 
available, I have calculated that the average specific 
gravity of the entire encephalon should be for the adult 
male, 1:0363, and for the adult female, 1.036. In a 
case, the sex of which is not given, Thudichum by 
direct observation obtained for the entire encephalon 
a specific gravity of 1:0373. 
It will be found, I believe, that these determinations 
are very close to the truth, for the case of individuals in 
the normal condition and in the prime of life, and that 
most of the wide variations which have been reported in 
this connection have been due rather to the method of 
experiment than to differences inherent in the specimens. 
Turning now to the weight of the brain itself, we find a 
large number of average weights on record, but such 
figures are of little interest since the “average man,” to 
whom they are assumed to belong, is a myth. It is 
far more advantageous to subdivide the records into 
smaller groups, according to the conditions which are 
found to be important, and to make the averages for 
these special groups, since observers are now agreed 
that age, sex, stature, body-weight, and race are all 
modifying circumstances. The most complete single 
series of observations is that which was made in
-P-A-G-E-96
    96 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
England by Dr. Boyd.t Ina recently published paper 
by the late Dr. John Marshall? particularly good use 
has been made of this material, and the presentation 
of the facts there will best serve our purpose. Since 
Boyd’s series was made on English subjects, it is more 
comparable than any other with the tables for the 
growth of the body which have been already given. 
Dr. Boyd examined the brains of 2,086 individuals, 
presumptively sane, at the Marylebone Workhouse in 
London. His method of observation is not completely 
stated, but was apparently as follows :—The brain was 
exposed, the pia being left in place. By horizontal 
sections the hemispheres were sliced away down to the 
tentorium. The remaining portions of the hemispheres 
were then separated from the quadrigemina. The 
cerebellum was next separated from the stem, repre- 
sented by the quadrigemina, pons, and the bulb. Each 
hemisphere, the cerebellum and the stem, were weighed 
separately. It will be seen that this method permitted 
very complete drainage of the fluids found in the 
brain after death, and this must be taken into account 
when Boyd’s figures are compared with the tables of 
some other observers who omitted this precaution. 
Dr. Marshall compiled from the records of Boyd the 
observations which were important for his purpose, 
and on these we must depend, since the separate 
observations by Boyd were never published and are 
now lost. Between the ages of 20-90 years, Marshall 
finds 698 male cases and 552 female. In making the 
table he divides these cases into three (horizontal) 
groups according to age, putting together those from 
20-40, those from 41-70, and those from 71-90 years. 
The individuals who fall within each group of years are

again divided into three series according to their stature, 
thus giving us the figures for the tall, medium, and the 
short persons. Under each one of the classes thus 
marked out—that is, among people between given ages 
and of a given stature—are recorded the weights of the 
subdivisions of the encephalon as above named. There 
is thus obtained an unusually complete presentation of 
the weight as affected by the most important conditions 
that modify it. Dr. Marshall’s tables were expressed in 
English weights and measures, but these I have taken 
the liberty of translating into the metric system, since 
by far the greatest number of observations on the brain 
are thus recorded.

98 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
On examining this table we find the following facts 
for consideration. In the case of the males thé weight 
of the encephalon regularly decreases with each period 
of years. It decreases also when cases belonging 
to the same groups, according to age, are compared 
according to their stature, the tallest individuals having 
the heaviest encephalon and the shortest the lightest. 
Examining next the different subdivisions of the en- 
cephalon, it appears that except in a few instances the 
same general statements hold good. Where an entry 
does not have the value anticipated when the brains are 
compared according to stature, the fact is indicated by 
the insertion of a small s, and where it fails to conform 
when the comparison is made according to age it is 
indicated by a small a. Thus to be explicit, in the case 
of males of intermediate stature the figures for those 
between 71-90 years do not conform in the case of the 
cerebellum and the stem, whereas among the shortest 
individuals those between 41-70 years fail to conform 
in the case of the cerebellum alone. In the case of the 
figures for the females it is found that the same general 
statements hold good, save that the number of excep- 
tions is larger. These latter are indicated in the same 
way, and it is hardly necessary to enumerate them in 
detail. As has been stated the observations on the 
females are based on a smaller number of cases, and 
it is especially in the groups where the number of 
individuals is probably least that the deviations of the 
general relations occur. We may conclude from these 
tables that after maturity the encephalon in the female 
is smaller than in the male, and that all its parts are 
smaller. When the observations are grouped according 
to age, they show that with increasing age there is a 
decrease in weight of the encephalon and in all its 
parts ; that for those of the same age and sex decrease
-P-A-G-E-99
  THE WEIGHT OF THE BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD. 99 
in stature is accompanied by a decrease in the. weight 
of the encephalon and in all its subdivisions, and that 
in these respects the two sexes are similar. I have also 
recast the figures of Marshall in such a way that in the 
above table the weight of the encephalon is in each 
instance made the standard, being taken as equal to 
100, and the percentage weights of the constituent 
subdivisions are then calculated. There is a remarkable 
constancy in the percentage values of the subdivisions 
of the encephalon of all ages, all statures, and both 
sexes. The value of the cerebrum in the female is in 
most of the averages less than 04 per cent. below that 
in the male, and this of course raises the percentage 
values of the other subdivisions, but whether any real 
importance is to be attached to this difference is 
debatable, although, so far as it goes, it is, in my 
opinion, significant. Advanced age in the female is also 
associated with a decrease in the proportional weight 
of the cerebrum. In Table 14 the averages have been 
made according to age, stature being neglected, and in. 
Table 15, according to stature, age being neglected. The 
constancy in the proportions of the subdivisions of the 
encephalon is the most important fact thus demonstrated.

The constancy of the proportional development has 
been heretofore insufficiently emphasised, but it is a 
matter that must be recalled when the significance of 
‘variations in the size of the encephalon is later discussed. 
~ Franceschi? is the only investigator who has taken 
the trouble to study the combined weight of the 
corpora. striata and the thalami-optici. His method of 
preparing this subdivision was to excise the basal 
ganglia with the cortex of the insula attached, and 
then with a scalpel dissect away both the cortex and 
the white matter of the insula until the grey substance 
of the ganglia could be seen clearly. The figures here 
given are condensed from his Table 23. They show 
a constant difference between the sexes, similarity of 
the right and left sides, but no decrease with advanced 
age.

The most comprehensive investigations on the weight 
of the spinal cord are those which have been recently 
published by Dr. Mies. The human cord without its 
nerve roots was found in thirteen grown persons to 
weigh between 24 and 33°3 grammes, the intermediate 
group of four individuals showing a cord weight of 
from 25 to 27 grammes. This corresponds well with 
the figures given by E. Bischoff and others. So far as 
the data go, which is not far, to be sure, there is no 
distinct variation in the weight of the cord due to sex. 
The cord at the same time does not appear to be so 
closely correlated with body-weight as with stature, and 
it will be readily seen that an increase in the length of 
the spinal canal would naturally be accompanied by an 
increase in the length of the cord, and this in turn by an 
increase in its weight. 
The general results which have been obtained from 
the examination of these figures gathered by Dr. Boyd 
are sufficiently well supported by other series of observa- 
tions to justify their acceptance without further evidence 
in their behalf. It will be noticed that this discussion

was opened by examining the weight of the brain after 
the twentieth year, when the most active growth changes 
have ceased. This was done since it seemed desirable 
to make the conditions found in the adult the point of 
departure, but the changes accompanying the increase 
of weight and volume during the first twenty years of 
life are still to be discussed.

THE increase in the weight of the brain during the 
earlier years of life is an important change, for which 
the most complete observations are those furnished by 
Vierordt in the accompanying tablet In this table the 
two sexes are considered separately, and the growth of 
the brain indicated by recording its average weight in 
persons dying at the respective ages ; though in some 
instances it will be noticed that the number of cases for a 
given year is much smaller than is desirable for the best 
results. The curves into which these figures have been 
thrown for graphic representation show decided irregu- 
larities, probably due to this same fact: nevertheless it 
is also true that the general character and relations of 
the two curves are not disturbed by these defects, and 
that certain broad conclusions may be safely drawn 
from them.

At birth the weight of the encephalon is nearly alike 
in the sexes, and in both growth during the first year, 
and indeed during the first four years, is rapid. By the 
seventh year the encephalon has reached approximately 
its full weight, the subsequent increase being compara- 
tively small. There is no other peculiarity in the 
growth process of either sex, unless later observations

should show that the approximation of the curves at 
fourteen years was really significant. Again, the pre-

extended to ninety years, there would be found nearly 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
i 
106 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
  the same weight of the brain persisting up to the onset 
of old age (about fifty years), when there appears a loss 
in weight, which becomes rapidly more evident, so that 
the smaller brain-weight of the aged must represent a 
percentage of loss in some instances quite large. For 
comparison it would be of interest to know how the 
cranial capacity of the extremely aged compared with 
that of those in the prime of life, and also whether there 
was possibly any correlation between longevity and. the 
initial weight of the brain, for it is conceivable that a 
heavy brain, though developed late in life, may in itself 
be unfavourable to length of years. From the curves it 
is clear that the brain-weight for the females runs almost 
from the start below that for the males, that the 
difference increases during the period of most active 
growth, and at the end of that time reaches nearly its 
maximum. This difference, is maintained throughout 
life. 
Concerning the weight of the encephalon in males 
and females at birth, a word more may be added. 
Most of the older’ observers found at this period the 
greater weight in the males. These figures of Vierordt 
show a slight excess in favour of the females, and this 
same occurs in other recent series. Of course the con- 
dition of greatest importance in determining the weight 
of the brain at birth is the size of the child, which can 
vary, as we know, within wide limits. To the larger 
and heavier children belong, on thé average, the heavier 
brains, and it will not be possible to clarify our ideas 
concerning the weight of the brain at birth and the 
influence of sex upon this weight until it is possible to 
compare more accurately male and female children, and 
to be sure that still-born children have not been in- 
cluded in the record. The matter is more complicated, 
and consequently more interesting, than at first sight
-P-A-G-E-107

appears. The records made by Boyd show the follow- 
ing relations :—

It is a suggestive fact that the greater part of the 
growth of the brain takes place before any of the formal 
educational processes have begun, for the mild schooling 
that occurs before the age ‘of seven or eight years can 
hardly have much influence. It may be, perhaps, that: 
such a slight increase in weight as occurs during the 
twenty years that follow is so distributed as to be much 
more effective than we at present imagine, but to this 
suggestion I shall return in a later chapter. 
Exact measurements support common observation in 
the conclusion that the proportional development of the 
body is different at maturity from that at birth, and in 
the same way the proportional development of the 
encephalon changes during the period of growth. The 
most recent figures are given in Table 19. These 
observations were made by Danielbekof on two hundred 
Russian children, whose average age was one month.t 
The second table is based on the observations of Boyd.?

  INCREASE OF THE BRAIN IN WEIGHT. 109 
The fact that in Boyd’s Table (20) the stem includes 
more than the pons and bulb, prevents a direct com- 
parison of the entries for the weight at birth with those 
in Table 19. But both tables emphasise the great 
development of the hemispheres at this time. 
Boyd’s table further brings out the interesting fact 
that there is comparatively small change in the per- 
centage relationships after the period of rapid growth is 
completed—that is, after the twentieth year. The 
failure of these proportional figures after the twentieth 
year to exactly agree with those already given in 
Table 14, is probably due to the fact that the time 
intervals have been differently chosen. Indeed, a com- 
parison of the two tables may serve to show, by reason 
of the small amount of differences, how little influence 
upon the proportional development is exerted by those 
conditions which have so much effect on absolute 
weight. It is further to be noted that in these latter 
tables the proportional weight of the hemispheres is as 
often superior in the female as it is inferior, hence we 
must be very cautious about inferring the influence of 
sex in this relation. 
Without giving special figures, Mies states that the 
spinal cord in man increases in weight rapidly during 
the first years of childhood, and more slowly later. He 
further adds that it still continues to increase after the 
brain has ceased to grow, and that its senile atrophy 
begins at a later age than in the case of the brain. His 
published observations show that in the new-born child 
the weight of the cord ranged from 2 to 6 grammes, 
with a mean weight of 342 grammes. Table 19 shows 
that Danielbekof found the weight of the spinal cord in 
male children averaging in age one month. 3‘9 grammes, 
and in the female 3:8 grammes. Comparing these with 
Mies’ figures for the weight in the adult (26 grammes)
-P-A-G-E-110
IIo THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
  it appears that between birth and maturity the weight 
of the cord has increased over 7} fold, as against an 
increase in the weight of the brain of less than one-half 
that amount. The proportional relations of the ence- 
phalon to the cord at different ages are very interesting. 
In the case of a three months’ foetus the brain weighed 
18 times as much as the cord; in the foetus of five 
months it was 1or times heavier ; and in the case of 
21 children born at full time (11 females and 10 males) 
it was almost 115 times heavier. On the other hand, in 
IO men at maturity the brain weighed 51°3 times the 
weight of the cord, and in 4 females the proportional 
weight was 49°47. There are, however, no published 
figures concerning the growth of the cord during the 
first twenty-five years, so that this process cannot be 
compared in detail with the growth changes taking 
place in the brain. But from the foregoing it is to be 
seen that in proportion to that of the brain the increase 
in the weight of the cord in early feetal life is rapid, at 
the, time of birth slow, and then more rapid up to 
maturity. 
With the increase of the central nervous system, 
occur changes in its composition concerning which a few 
observations exist. In its first form the entire central 
system is grey, and only later do portions of it become 
white by the development of myeline in the sheaths of 
the nerve fibres. The myeline contains fatty substances 
and a smaller proportion of water than the axial part of 
the fibre which it ensheaths. The following table indi- 
cates the proportion of water and myeline (extracted by 
ether) found in the white matter (fibres of the callosum) 
at birth and at maturity.t

  Observations made on the growth of any part made by 
the “general” method are of little use in determining 
the age at which growth in the individual ceases, be- 
cause, so long as any of the individuals grow the curve 
will rise, and there is no way to determine whether the 
rise is due to a slight growth in many, or a greater 
growth ina few. Further than this it is not probable 
that the cessation occurs at the same age in all classes 
of the community, and we might fairly expect that it 
would be continued for the longest time in those most 
favoured. To this conclusion the observations by Venn 
in England directly point.t Suffice it to say that Venn 
measured the heads of students at Cambridge through- 
out the entire student period, and found that the head 
increased in height, breadth, and length during this 
time. From this it is inferred that the brain also 
increased, and it is highly probable that such is the case. 
The observations of West, made in the Worcester 
(Mass.) Schools,? show a steady growth in the length 
and breadth of the head between the ages of five and 
twenty-one years. They also show between the ages of 
eleven and thirteen years an approximation of the curves

for the length of the head, a relation which is less clear 
in the curves for breadth, but still suggested by them. 
Moreover, since the curves for both measurements fail 
to indicate that these growth changes have ceased even 
at the age of twenty-one years, further observations 
would be of value.

indicate increase beyond this age, but in making any 
comparison it must be borne in mind that the observa- 
tions by West were on living children developing under 
fairly favourable conditions, while those collected by 
Vierordt were from necropsies on the least favoured 
classes, and also that all the increase in these dimensions 
of the head is not to be directly referred back to the 
encephalon, but due allowance should be made for the

increase in the thickness of the scalp and bones, and also » 
for the space between the brain and dura. 
The brain-weight among non-European races has 
been but little studied, and nothing is to be gained by 
attempting to combine the more scattered observations 
that exist. In the United States, however, during the 
war of the secession there were made by Dr. S. B. 
Hunt * a series of observations on the brain-weight of 
negroes and mulattoes as compared with that of native 
white soldiers. It is probable that in all cases the 
negro blood in the mulatto was mainly derived from 
the mother.

ordinarily. found in the hospitals of cities. Statistically, 
the results are satisfactory. They show the male negro 
brain to be less heavy than that of the average white 
soldier, and that in mulattoes (the father being white) 
a mixture of less than half white blood gives a brain- 
weight below that of the pure negro, whereas in those 
possessing half or more than half white blood, the 
weight of the brain is above that figure. 
Recently Gilchenko* has reported on the weight of 
the brain in several transcaucasian races. The weight 
was that of the entire encephalon covered with pia, 
and was taken without drainage. These results are of 
especial interest as showing the wide variation which 
occurs among races of the same region and fairly 
similar in their culture.

  early suggested itself as a means of determining the 
weight of the brain among those races which were diffi- - 
cult of direct observation. To determine the capacity 
of a skull requires much art, despite the apparent 
simplicity of the procedure. For this determination the 
cranium is usually filled with either shot, water, or some 
of the varieties of small round seeds, and the amount of 
this material which it will hold is subsequently weighed 
or measured. There are more difficulties connected 
with the operation than would at first sight appear, but 
leaving them aside, if a given observer in a uniform way 
determines the capacity of a series of skulls, the figures 
which he obtains will be fairly comparable among them- 
selves. For example, the table which is given below is 
based upon observations by Barnard Davis, in which, by 
a uniform method, the capacity of a large number of 
skulls was taken, and then by a formula the brain-weight 
deduced from the cranial capacity.t :

116 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
  rearranged in the order of the average weight of male 
brains, which is different from the order in which Davis 
himself has published them. Supposing his method 
to have been reliable, we have here a table giving at 
least the relative brain development in the races com- 
pared. The European races head the list and the 
Australian group is at the foot; but it is plain that if 
the attempt were made to arrange the intermediate 
groups according to the degree of their supposed intelli- 
gence, they would not stand in the same relation that 
they now do. 
Difficulty also attends the attempt to correlate the 
weight of the brain with the stature of the several races. 
While in general, among Europeans, the taller indi- 
viduals in a given race have the heavier brains, it does 
not follow that the taller races have the heavier brains, 
so that a correlation between brain-weight and stature 
is only applicable within narrow limits. The correlation 
is closer, apparently, with the mass of the body than 
with its height. But concerning remote races there 
exist for the most part only such general facts as that 
they are lightly or heavily built, and no careful deter- 
minations of the weight. 
At best a conclusion from bodily development to 
brain-weight is hazardous. Indeed, the fact that the 
brain at the seventh year of life has reached almost its 
full weight and the skull corresponding to it almost its 
full capacity, while the stature of these same individuals 
is but two-thirds, and the body-weight only about one- 
third of what it will be at maturity, makes it readily 
appreciable that it is impracticable to directly corre- 
late the two growth processes, since they take place at 
different periods, the increase in stature and weight 
following in so large a measure the practical completion 
of growth in the brain. Moreover, Davis and others
-P-A-G-E-117
INCREASE OF THE BRAIN IN WEIGHT. 117 
  have pointed out that among all the geographical 
groups, except the European and the Australian, there 
are two types of brain, a light and a heavy, these two 
types being well marked in the Oceanic, Asiatic, and 
African races, though the average figures here given do 
not take account of them. 
The extreme difference shown in this table between 
the average weights for the males is (European, 1,340 ; 
1,190, Australian) 150 grammes, while the European 
female is 160 grammes, less than the male; thus putting 
the Australian male and European female on the same 
level as regards gross brain-weight, and thereby suggest- 
ing that the inference from brain-weight directly to. 
intelligence is not a happy one. There are several 
circumstances which here influence the determination 
of the difference between the sexes. On the one hand, 
in grouping skulls according to sex by means of osteo- 
logical characters, those male skulls which have the 
special characters poorly developed are placed in the 
female group, and vice versd. Since capacity is’ not 
dependent on these characters, the result of this is to 
put some larger male skulls in the female group, and 
vice versé, and so to make more equal the figures for 
the two sexes. At the same time, Davis assumed that 
the relation between the weight of the brain and the 
capacity of the skull was the same for both sexes. 
From the observations of Bischoff,t there is reason to 
think that in the female the brain more nearly fills the 
cranial cavity by from 3 to 4 per cent. Introducing 
this correction into the table would alter the result 
materially by raising the average weight for the 
female. But, granting all corrections, the most striking 
feature of the table, the high average brain-weight of 
the European male, would not be materially affected, 
' Bischoff, Hirngewicht des Menschen, 1880, 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
118 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
  In the preceding paragraphs it has been the value of 
the relative figures within a single series of observations 
that has been under discussion, but when from the 
cranial capacity the attempt is made to deduce the size 
of an individual brain, the usual difficulties appear. 
The authors are fairly well agreed that the relations of 
the brain to the cranial cavity vary with age, sex, and 
cause of death. The brain appears more nearly to fill 
the cranial cavity in the young than in the adult ; in old 
age there is an increasing diminution in both weight 
and volume. In females it more nearly fills the cranial 
cavity than in the males, and direct observation shows 
that its volume may be less than that of the cranial 
cavity by from 7 to 33 per cent. of the latter. Manou- 
vrier found that sex being neglected, the brains which 
het examined were about 16 per cent. less in volume 
than the cranial cavity ; but the observations were made 
on dried skulls, and these compared with fresh brains, 
no correction having been made for the shrinkage of the 
skulls. This shrinkage, due to drying, would appear 
from certain figures published by Bischoff to reduce the 
cranial capacity from 1 to 2 per cent. Despite these 
data, when the cranial capacity of a single skull is alone 
given, it is possible only with much uncertainty to 
deduce the size of the particular brain which filled it. 
On the capacity of the skull according to age, a few 
observations have been recorded by Broca. At any 
given time it must always have a capacity somewhat 
greater than the volume of the brain, but whether the 
relations of growth are such that an enlargement of the 
skull is followed by the enlargement of the brain, or 
whether they grow simultaneously, has yet to be 
determined.

HAVING presented some of the observations relating to 
the normal size of the brain and the history of the steps 
by which that size is attained, we naturally turn to the 
study of the extreme variations in size, because difference 
in size has been made the basis of many current views. 
The measurements of the capacity of skulls have shown 
that the different races of men differ widely with regard 
to the probable size and weight of their brains ; and ‘that 
in general those races which are inferior both in stature 
and in body-weight, have, at the same time, a small 
cranial capacity. While the heaviest brain-weights 
belong to the European races and the lightest to the 
Australians, thus giving a moderately wide difference 
in the weight of the brain corresponding to a ,wide 
difference in culture, yet it is quite impossible even in 
ug
-P-A-G-E-120
  120 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN, 
such a condensed series to harmonise the intermediate 
groups with the theory that brain-weight and culture, 
as we measure it, are closely correlated. 
If attention is confined to the European peoples with 
whom we are most familiar, it is found that occasionally 
there occur individuals noticeable for their deviation from 
the general average by reason of their weight or stature 
or both. These persons of unusual stature are the giants 
and dwarfs. It is customary, among English authors, 
to consider individuals more than seven feet (2,133 mm.) 
tall as giants, and those under four feet (1,219 mm.) as 
dwarfs. Examination shows that the giants owe their 
excess in stature either to an abnormal length of the 
lower limb, or to an excessive development in which 
the proportions of the normal body are fairly well main- 
tained. As a rule, however, the head in giants is dis- 
proportionately small, and also, as a rule, they are 
neither mentally nor physically possessed of unusual 
powers. In fact, their general health tends to be poor, 
and they are short-lived. These facts are still without 
a full explanation, though it is possible that in one 
group a nervous disease (acromegaly) is responsible for 
the result.t 
On the other hand, the dwarfs have more vigour, and 
tend to be nearly normally developed, with the excep- 
tion of one well-marked group among them, in which 
the excessive shortness of the lower limbs accounts for 
the small stature. In these deformed dwarfs a rachitic 
condition is often a prominent feature. In general in 
this group the trunk is well developed, the head propor- 
tionately large, and the individuals active, both mentally 
and physically. We have much to learn concerning 
such exceptional persons, but there are no observations 
* Dana, “Giants and Gigantism,’ Scribner's Magazine, vol. xvii., 
No. 2, Feb., 1895.
-P-A-G-E-121
  VARIATIONS IN BRAIN-WEIGHT. 121 
on the histological structure of their bodies which would 
enable us to interpret the differences between them in 
terms of their cellular constitution. There is some 
reason to think, however, that in dwarfs the cell 
elements are of small size. In every way it would 
appear that the physiological condition of the dwarf 
is superior to that of the giant, and that he repre- 
sents the more efficient organism. These facts have 
the following bearing: In general the presumptive 
brain-weight among giants is greater than among the 
dwarfs, yet to put the case most conservatively, the 
giants are not recognised in any sense a mentally 
superior group. Hence under these conditions the 
larger brain is not correlated with the greater intelli- 
gence. 
This relation of brain to body may be considered 
from another point of view. / It has always been 
assumed that some light would be obtained from com- 
parative anatomy, and to that end many observations 
have been made in various animals on the weight and 
size of the brain, and its relation to the weight of the 
body. -It appears that man is surpassed in the gross 
weight of the encephalon only by the elephant, 
some of the whales, and the recently extinct Stellar’s 
sea-cow. When the weight of the brain is compared 
with the weight of the fully grown body, its: propor- 
tional value is found to be higher in man than in most 
animals, although some of the lower monkeys, small 
rodents, and some birds, have a proportional brain- 
weight which is greater than that in man. Attention 
has already been called to the fact that this proportional 
value of the brain is greatest at birth, and diminishes 
throughout the growing period. ‘The same is probably 
true of all vertebrates. As an illustration of this point 
a table on the relation between the weight of the brain
-P-A-G-E-122
  122 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
and the weight of the body in several species of dogs is 
here quoted from Wilder. i

There are two factors at work to bring about the 
different ratios here given. In the first place, the brain 
at birth has more nearly completed its growth than has 
the body ; young dogs, like the first two mentioned, 
haye, in common with all other young vertebrates, the 
brain disproportionately large ; and in the second place, 
the large varieties grow for a longer time. Cases 3 
and 4 in this table may be cited, as showing the 
difficulty of making a correlation between brain-weight 
and intelligence. The large English terrier, 3°5 years 
old, has approximately only one-seventh of the body- 
weight, and but one-half of the brain-weight, of the 
Newfoundland. The ratios are correspondingly unlike, 
" yet certainly both of them belong to the breeds counted 
as intelligent, and it should be safe to say that the 
difference between the respective ratios of their brain 
and body-weights is out of all proportion to the pre- 
sumptive difference in their mental powers.

-P-A-G-E-123
VARIATIONS IN BRAIN-WEIGHT. 123 
  On comparing the two sexes in the human race, the 
brain, compared with the entire body, is found to be 
proportionally heavier in the female than in the male. 
In this instance the only logical interpretation is that 
the body is somewhat less developed in the female than 
in the male, and this we know to be the case from the 
records on the growth of the muscular system. For this 
reason no effort will be made to restate the various 
observations on the proportional development of the 
brain in the two sexes, or the number of grammes of 
body substance present for each gramme of brain. In 
such arguments it is assumed that the smaller the mass of 
the body over which a unit of brain substance presides, 
the more efficiently will the body be controlled, and the 
more intelligent will be the individual. This view is 
not well grounded. While the large absolute weight of 
the brain in man as compared with other animals still 
demands interpretation, it is evident from the foregoing 
facts that conclusions based upon the proportional 
development of the brain may be very easily mislead- 
ing, because the variation in that proportion depends 
upon differences in body-weight. In reality there is 
‘here an extremely complex problem, and although in 
the estimation of the probable intelligence of any animal! 
both the absolute and relative size of the brain are 
factors, yet they are but two factors among a large 
number, and therefore their importance can only be 
determined after further analysis and comparison. 
Returning to the principal question before us, we have 
to inquire whether from any of the physical characters 
of the brain the intelligence of the individual can be 
inferred. By way of introduction it will be necessary to

brain in terms of the entire body, consult the tables by Vierordt,

examine the entire range of brain-weight for the adult. 
This is given in Table 24, where the brains are arranged 
in five classes, according to size, namely, macrocephalic, 
large, medium, small, and microcephalic.

Excluded from these tables, of course, are the cases 
of monsters born with comparatively little functional 
brain substance, but which have continued to live for 
months. Directly continuous with these excluded cases 
is the group of defective individuals with heads ranging 
from. extremely small to small, and designated as 
microcephalics. The weight below which the brain 
is designated as microcephalic is 1,000 grammes in 
males, 900 grammes in females. The best list of these 
microcephalic cases has been compiled by Marchand, 
and contains some fifty entries, including male brains * 
weighing up to 1,015 grammes, and female brains up to 
924 grammes, but it is unnecessary to repeat it here zz 
extenso. Examination of the table shows that among 
children the smallest brain-weight is reported by Calori, 
the case being that of a female child 9 months of age, 
53 cm. high, and possessed of a brain weighing 69°3 
* Marchand, Acta. d. Kaiserl. Carol. Deutsch, Akad. der Natur- 
forscher, Halle, 1890.
-P-A-G-E-125
  VARIATIONS IN BRAIN-WEIGHT. 125 
grammes. Among the microcephalics, in which the 
brain may be considered as having attained approxi- 
mately its full weight—ze., those more than seven years 
old—we have the case of Helene Becker cited by 
Bischoff. This girl died at seven years of age with a 
stature of 78 cm., and a brain-weight of 219 grammes. 
If from the fifty cases cited by Marchand children 
less than ten years of age are excluded, there remain 
twelve cases in which the brain-weight was less than 
500 grammes, fourteen in which it ranged between 500 
and 800 grammes, and in eleven cases between 800-1,015 
grammes. In these instances the brain is not only of 
the small size indicated by the enclosing skull, but at 
the same time the skull is apt to be unusually thick, 
and either the brain does not fill it so completely as 
normally, or the enlargement of the cerebral ventricles 
by fiuid causes the actual weight of the nerve substance 
to be smaller; so that when the volume of the brain is 
deduced from its weight on the assumption that it was 
normal in its proportions, it is in some instances found 
to be much smaller than the cranial cavity. Further- 
more, even this mass often contains a large proportion 
of undeveloped or degenerate tissue, and the encephalon 
may thus be of even less functional value than its small 
size would suggest. It thus appears that the essential 
anatomical feature in microcephalism is not so much the 
small size of the brain as its deficient construction, of 
which this small size can usually be taken as an index. 
On the other hand, that small size and great faultiness in 
construction are not necessarily connected is suggested 
by Marchand, who has pointed out that the micro- 
cephalics are by no means necessarily aphasic, and that 
one Antonia Grandoni, a woman living to be forty-one 
years of age, with a stature of 132 cm., and a brain- 
weight of 289 grammes, both sang and spoke readily,
-P-A-G-E-126
126 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
  while other microcephalics have possessed more com- 
mand over spoken language, and still others have made 
use of deaf-mute signs as a means of communication. 
The senses are often acute and the motor activity good, 
and in such cases, of course, there is a rudimentary 
intellectual life. In other words, this class represents 
individuals with diminished intelligence, but even a very 
small brain-weight, as is shown in the case just cited, is 
not incompatible with the performance of simple mental 
processes ; at the same time it cannot be assumed that 
these individuals were sufficiently well organised to 
make life possible for them if they had not been 
specially protected. In every group of this table of 
Marchand the female brain-weight is distinctly less 
than that of the male. In tabular form the facts 
appear as follows :— 
TABLE 25.—THE WEIGHT OF THE BRAIN IN MICROCEPHALICS. 
(Condensed from Marchand.) 
In each of the three groups taken the average weight for the 
females is less than that for the males.

Since in these groups the two sexes are presumptively 
on a par mentally, having their intellectual processes 
very much reduced, it is certainly curious that this 
common mental level should still be accompanied by a 
higher brain-weight in the males than in the females. 
The usual argument assumes that the simplest psychic 
powers are, as indicated in the table, correlated with a
-P-A-G-E-127
  VARIATIONS IN BRAIN-WEIGHT. 127 
minimal mass of brain substance which, other things 
being equal, should be the same in both sexes. It 
further requires that when the brain-weight increases 
there should be an increased mental capacity, and 
finally, since it is found that the average European 
male has a brain-weight about 120 grammes in excess 
of that for the female, it is therefore concluded that the 
male brain has superior powers, of which the 120 
grammes can serve as a measure. Since among micro- 
cephalics there is still a distinction in brain-weight 
according to sex, the current explanation must be con- 
sidered as incomplete. 
On passing from the microcephalics to other groups 
in which the weight of the brain is greater, we come 
into the company of those individuals who are able to 
make a fairly successful struggle for existence, a capacity 
which is taken as one measure of the intelligence. It is 
perfectly plain, however, that a wild life under clement 
conditions can be met by a far simpler mental organisa- 
tion than is needed to face town life in the temperate 
zone, and hence the capacity to lead an independent 
existence is but a poor standard. 
The observations recorded in the preceding chapters 
compare average brain-weights (small, medium, and 
large being taken together) with one another, and show 
several conditions which influence this average, but as 
they stand the figures furnish no basis for correlating 
brain-weight with brain functions. Attempts have been 
made, however, to get some light on this from the com- 
parison of the differen: classes in the community. 
Take, for example, the brain-weights of eminent men, 
arranged according to age with omission of certain 
mythical records like those for Tourgenieff (2,012 
grammes), Cromwell (2,231 grammes), and Byron (2,238 
grammes).

The application of the term “eminent” to men whose 
names stand in the preceding table, is, in some measure, 
a concession to custom. While it is easy to select from 
this list those recognised as persons of first-rate ability, 
there are others whose accomplishments would by no 
means warrant such recognition. The list, therefore, 
contains not only the brain-weights of a number of 
persons unquestionably remarkable, but also those 
of other persons whose title to our regard is merely 
the successful pursuit of some learned profession. This 
latter group, to be sure, is the one concerning which 
more information is most needed. 
These data have been in part utilised by Manouvrier, 
who has published the following table, based on the 
observations by Broca and by himself, in which a com- 
parison is attempted between the brain-weight of 
eminent as compared with that of ordinary persons. 
The range in the weight of the encephala is represented 
at the left, Table 27, and then in each group of in- 
dividuals the percentage of cases occurring within the 
given limits is noted. The weights around which the 
greatest percentage of the cases centre are those of 
most significance, 3

The first series of ordinary Parisian men shows, as we 
should expect, the maximum frequency of 31°5 per cent. 
of cases between 1,300-1,400 grammes. Examining the 
Parisians of tall stature, we find the point of maximum 
frequency amounting to 34°6 per cent., and raised to 
between 1,400-1,500 grammes. On comparing the 
eminent men with this latter group, it is found that 
the maximum. frequency falls also between 1,400- 
1,500 grammes, but there is this difference, that among 
eminent men there is a decidedly larger number of 
cases between 1,500-1,600 grammes, and also beyond

1,700 grammes a small percentage of the cases not at 
all represented in the records for ordinary persons. 
The whole group of eminent men is therefore moved 
slightly upward in the scale of weight. 
Before offering any further comment on this table, I 
shall present another in which the cranial capacities of 
modern Parisians, murderers, and eminent men are 
compared. ' The purpose of this table is similar to that 
of the foregoing, and it differs from it only in requiring 
the additional assumption that the brain-weights are 
related in nearly the same manner as are the cranial 
capacities.

From the examination of Table 27 it appears that 
the greater brain-weights are more frequent among the 
eminent men, even when these latter are compared 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
132 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN, 
with the group having the greatest stature; at the 
same time there is no doubt that the tall persons here 
taken as a standard belonged to a less favoured social 
class. There is every reason to think that the favoured 
classes in the community will have a_brain-weight 
superior to that of the class from which all our ordinary 
averages have been derived, and the comparison there- 
fore fails to be exact, so that although there is no 
doubt about the facts which have been given, their 
interpretation must be postponed. To Table 28, 
based on cranial capacities of eminent men, the same 
argument applies. In this table there is also introduced 
a series of observations on the cranial capacity of 
murderers. This series is of interest in connection with 
the attempt to determine whether the criminal has 
bodily peculiarities which mark him. As will be seen, 
the criminals are very close to the modern Parisian in 
their cranial capacity, and even somewhat surpass them, 
though falling distinctly below the distinguished men 
with whom they are compared. It would appear from 
this that the criminals in question had been mainly 
derived from the same class that furnished records with 
which they are here compared. There exist no 
measurements either on the brains or skulls of eminent 
women, and the differences due to sex, which have been 
so much discussed in other groups, are therefore entirely 
wanting in this one. From these facts it is plain that 
the brains of eminent men are the heaviest, and their 
skulls the most capacious, but we know little of 
the brain-weight and ‘cranial capacity of their neigh- 
bours—men successful in business and professional life ° 
—who, though not distinguished, grew up and lived 
under like conditions. As far as it goes, the evidence 
only shows that the members of the less fortunate social 
classes have the smaller brain-weight. An emphasis of
-P-A-G-E-133
    VARIATIONS IN BRAIN-WEIGHT. 133 
this point is warranted because the central nervous 
system, whatever its natural perfection, must be ex- 
tremely responsive to surrounding social conditions, and 
thus growth processes in it be modifiable in no small 
degree, hence the conditions which social status implies 
are probably important. 
The group of very large brains yet remains to be 
considered. The weight recorded for the brain of Oliver 
Cromwell, 2,231 grammes ; for Byron, 2,238 grammes ; 
and for Turgenieff, 2,012 grammes, would have given 
these persons heads which could hardly have escaped 
description or portraiture, by which the post-mortem 
records might be corroborated. But there is a complete 
absence of such collateral evidence, save in the last 
instance, besides much evidence in the case of the 
first two, positively opposed to the correctness of the 
recorded weights ; while the last case has been reported 
without detail. In any long series of observations on 
brain-weight there are always found a few macro- 
cephalic brains. For example, in Bischoff’s tables, giving 
the weight of 559 male brains, there are 59 cases above 
1,501 grammes, and 18 cases above 1,601 grammes, and 
one, a mechanic, with a brain-weight of 1,925 grammes. 
It happens that among these 59 cases given by Bischoff, 
there is one learned man, Dr. Hermann of Munich, 
13 criminals of various sorts, and next to the mechanic 
just mentioned, comes a day labourer, with a brain- 
weight of 1,770 grammes. These conditions would be 
found repeated in other long series. It follows, there- 
fore, that within a given series there is no evidence that 
the persons possessing the very large or macrocephalic 
brains, form the more intelligent fraction of the group. 
In this group, also, the female brains of the macroce- 
phalic type, as shown in Table 24, never attain so great 
“a weight as in the case of the males, although statisti-
-P-A-G-E-134
134 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
  cally they are just as abnormal. Pathological hyper- 
plasia of brain substance suggests itself to explain some 
of these cases. The brain is sometimes described as 
expanding on the removal of the skull cap, suggesting 
that it had been compressed during life, and in some of 
these cases part of the excessive growth is due to an 
increase in the supporting tissues, but further data are 
wanting. 
From this survey we finally come back to the very 
general idea that in the case of the brain, as among all 
organisms and organs called similar, there may be wide 
individual variations, and as it is midway between the 
extremes that the greatest number of cases occur, there- 
fore we must consider the most numerous forms to be 
those best adapted to surrounding conditions, and con- 
sequently also look to them for the most perfect physio- 
logical reactions. If such reasoning is correct, we should 
hardly expect to find the best intelligence usually asso- 
ciated with excessive brain-weight. At the same time, 
as soon as small or macrocephalic brains are examined, 
deficiencies in the intelligence appear, and, although 
there is no exact correspondence between the two forms 
of loss, yet at the lower end of the series the connection 
between vanishing intelligence and minimal brain-weight 
is close. 
In the foregoing paragraphs the variations of the 
brain-weight among sane persons have alone been 
described ; it remains for us to examine these rela- 
tions among the insane, and from the facts in this 
quarter select such as will bear upon the problem. The 
great series of records by Dr. Boyd contains observations 
on the insane as well as the sane. There were 400 
observations on insane males and 325 on insane females. 
Tabulated in the same manner as those for the sane, 
they stand as follows :—

When these figures are compared with those for the 
sane, in Table 13, it appears that in the insane males the 
encephala in two groups are heavier than in the sane. 
The mean weight for the insane males, however, is 
slightly less than for the sane (15 grammes). When the 
females are compared in the same way, it is found that 
in the insane five groups show the encephalon heavier 
than in the sane, and the mean weight in both classes is 
the same. Since in the insane the wasting forms of 
mental disease are proportionally much more numerous 
among the males than the females, the smaller difference 
in weight according to sex in the insane becomes 
explicable.
-P-A-G-E-136
    136 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
It appears from this that the insane are not a class 
with a characteristic brain-weight. The absolute in- 
crease in the weight of the stem is noticeable in both 
sexes, while the cerebellum undergoes the most decided 
increase in the case of the male, and both peculiarities 
are most evident in tall persons. When among the 
insane we compare the two sexes, it is plain that the 
difference in the proportional development of the hemi- 
spheres is slightly less than among the sane. This is 
probably due to the wasting processes which tend to 
reduce the weight of the male encephalon as a whole, 
affecting especially the cerebral hemispheres ; but when 
the averages for stature independent of age, and for 
age independent of stature are taken, they are found 
strikingly similar under both conditions. The figures 
are so uniform that a single record of the proportion— 
one for age and one for stature—will suffice.

  VARIATIONS IN BRAIN-WEIGHT. 137 
The proportion of the cerebral hemispheres is less 
than in the sane, and as a consequence the percentages 
for the stem and cerebellum are higher, and this is due 
not only to the diminution in the absolute weight of the 
cerebrum, but also to the increase in that of the cere- 
bellum and stem. The insane, therefore, present en- 
cephala that are very slightly less than the normal in 
absolute weight, and in proportional development show 
a slightly smaller figure for the cerebral hemispheres, 
while the difference between the two sexes is less 
marked in them than in the sane. 
The different groups of the insane have been examined 
by several investigators with a view to determining any 
possible connection between encephalic weight and the 
several forms of mental diseases. With the insane are 
usually reckoned the congenital idiots, and those whose 
mental defect is due to arrest of growth during the 
period of development. This group is nearly identical 
with that of the microcephalics, and as that has been 
already discussed, it may here be omitted. It is then to 
be determined whether the fully developed encephalon 
ranging between small and large is, by virtue of varia- 
tions in its size, subject to different forms of mental 
disease. The accompanying Table (31) is based on 
observations made by Boyd at the Somerset County 
Lunatic Asylum, England, so that the individuals 
examined were drawn from a rural as contrasted with 
the urban population which furnished the cases in the 
table for the sane ; nevertheless the two sets of observa- 
tions are fairly comparable. As will be seen, it has 
been made up in a different manner from those which 
have previously been presented, the cases being classed 
according to the form of mental disease. For the males 
they are arranged in series, beginning with the forms in 
which the encephalic weight was found to be greatest,
-P-A-G-E-138
  138 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
and placing the others in regular order below. As a 
result, the three forms of mental disease in which . 
wasting of the brain takes place (the last three entries 
in the table) are the ones which stand lowest in the 
series. The percentage values of the different divisions 
of the encephalon are given for each form, and that for 
the cerebrum is found to be less in those diseases in 
which the encephalic weight is less. When the groups 
for the females are treated in the same way, the average 
encephalic weight and the percentage value of the 
cerebrum are both less in the class of wasting diseases 
than in the other class, but the encephalic weight does 
not regularly decrease from the first to last group.

  VARIATIONS. IN BRAIN-WEIGHT. 139 
In the forms of mania are found the greatest ence- 
phalic weights, while the lowest occur in the forms of 
general paralysis and dementia. The pathological pro- 
cesses which in the latter groups account for decrease in 
weight are generally recognised, whereas in the manias 
the overfilling of the encephalon with blood may in part 
account for the larger figures obtained. Whether there 
is any significance to be attached to the weights given 
for melancholia and epilepsy cannot be determined, and 
it would also be unwise to draw inferences from the 
relative weights of the subdivisions of the encephalon 
in the different forms, since if these were really signi- 
ficant the two sexes would be expected to give similar 
figures ; but such is not the case. Since here, as else- 
where, there appears in encephalic weight the character- 
istic difference between the two sexes, it might be 
inferred that the smaller weight for both sexes in the 
diseases which are associated most clearly with the loss 
of mental power, is an expression of the breaking down 
of those structures in the brain on which the mental life 
anatomically depends, and there is some pathological 
evidence to support such a view. The original records 
from which this table has been condensed give the cases 
under each division, arranged according to age, but not 
grouped according to stature ; and hence the figures in 
these partial tables do not exhibit the same regularity 
as those in the tables for the sane, but the number of 
cases entered in each decennial period is not large 
enough to warrant the expectation that the law of age 
would come out clearly, especially as the classification 
according to stature is lacking. Taking, then, the insane 
altogether, we find them, as far as their encephalic 
weight is concerned, very similar to sane persons, and 
the differences which appear in this table may be 
looked upon in a large measure as the result of disease,

and therefore do not warrant the idea that moderate 
variation in the weight of the brain is a predisposing 
cause to any particular form of brain affection. 
Bringing together the facts which have been included 
in this chapter, it is plain that they contribute mainly 
to a healthy scepticism concerning the current interpre- 
tations of brain-weight. The most hopeful method of 
investigation was the comparison of different classes in 
the community, the classes being based on intellectual 
performance. This has proved unsatisfactory, for the 
reason that the individuals forming the several classes 
have developed under different social conditions. It is 
clear, therefore, that the differences in weight are not to 
be associated with the difference in intellectual capacity, 
until the possible influence of social conditions has been 
excluded. The best comparison is that between the 
criminals and the ordinary persons, since the conditions 
were probably nearly similar in the two cases. It is 
certainly very easy ‘to indicate the point where the 
mental capacities diminish because of the very small 
size of the encephalon, but it must be remembered that 
the very small encephala are never simply miniatures of 
healthy brains, but are always more or less organically 
defective; and our problem is thereby complicated 
even in this case, where the relation between size and 
intelligence seems so evident. It is therefore desirable 
to discuss this question from the standpoint of the struc- 
tural elements of the brain, in order to see whether 
some. of the confusing results which come from regard- 
ing it e masse, may not be cleared up when the varia- 
tions in the structural units are given a proper value.

IN this chapter the size, shape, number, and growth of 
the nerve elements will be considered. The central 
system is a mass of such elements embedded in the 
structures which support and nourish them, and the 
changes observed in the whole mass must be therefore 
the sum of the changes taking place in all the con- 
stituents, but since in the matter of enlargement the 
subsidiary structures play but a minor part, attention 
will be given principally to the nerve elements. 
At an early stage in any developing mammal the 
central nervous system is represented by a tube, the 
walls of which are formed by ectodermal cells, and by 
two strands of similar cells coextensive with the tube 
and lying on either side of it. These latter give rise to 
the ganglionic portion of the nervous system, which it 
is convenient to distinguish from the medullary portion, 
formed by the tube alone. By flexures of this tube, 
and by variation in the thickness of its walls due to

growth, the complex nervous system of the adult is 
finally elaborated. At first the walls are formed by a 
thin layer one or two cells in thickness, then there 
appear next to the central canal, germinal cells which 
rapidly divide. A portion of the cells thus formed 
become young nerve cells—neuroblasts—another portion 
build up the framework—the neurospongium—in which 
the nerve elements lie. With these changes the cells

increase in number, then in size, and their form becomes 
more complicated, while at the same time they separate 
more sy from one ener ber. To Hag eeece these

implication that these two structures were genetically 
distinct, but to-day the view is held that the fibre is the 
outgrowth of the cell, and for that reason I shall follow 
Schafer in speaking of the whole element, including all 
the outgrowths, as a nerve cell ; and then for convenience 
distinguish between the cell-body and its prolongations.

_ A detailed description of the yarious shapes and sizes 
of such cells would not be i ar but several types 
may be mentioned. The largest cells, which are poly- 
hedral, are found in the ventral horns of the spinal cord 
and in the morphological continuation of these horns

into the brain-stem. Next in size come the large pyra- 
midal cells in the cerebral cortex, the cells of Purkinje 
in the cerebellar cortex and the great ovoid cells in the 
spinal ganglia. Besides these there are to be found a 
host of smaller forms everywhere, except in the spinal 
ganglia, where very small cells do not occur. Fig. 20 
represents a fully-grown large nerve cell from the ventral 
horn of the spinal cord of man. This may be taken as 
the basis for a more extended description. 
The description of the nerve cell begins’ with the 
nucleus, since that structure is the first to be clearly 
developed. In the early stages the nucleus is ovoid and 
contains a chromatic or deeply staining substance in 
small masses. Representing at the start almost the 
entire cell, the nucleus becomes later surrounded by 
what is really an enormous quantity of cytoplasm, and 
also forms within itself one, or even two, inclusions. The 
larger of these, the nucleolus, is deeply stainable, and this 
in turn may develop the second inclusion, the nucleololus, 
much more tiny than itself, and noticeable only in the 
largest cells. It is the cytoplasm, of course, which, 
according to the locality, may be pyramidal or ovoid in 
form. Perhaps the most noticeable substance in the 
cytoplasm is the pigment. As a rule this is not present 
at birth, but appears later, and increases with age. 
A stainable substance is also found distributed in the 
cytoplasm and in all its prolongations, except the one 
designated the axis-cylinder process or the neuron: thus 
this process even at its base exhibits a character diffe- 
rent from that of the other prolongations. By some 
methods of preparation the granules in the cytoplasm 
appear to be arranged in rows; these rows are some- 
times concentric with the nucleus, but near the periphery 
of the cell they often extend into the prolongations, and 
if a significance is attached to their arrangement on the
-P-A-G-E-145
  THE NERVE ELEMENTS. 145 
assumption that they indicate the pathways for the 
impulses, it is interesting to note that they occasionally 
enter the cytoplasm by one prolongation of the cell, and 
leave it by another, without interruption and without 
running close to the centre of the cell. When the cells 
of a single locality are treated with staining reagents, it 
is usually found that while some are deeply coloured 
others are not. 
Age certainly is a factor in determining this colour 
reaction. The youngest cells, the neuroblasts, stain diffe- 
rently from those more developed; these latter differ 
according to their maturity, the condition of rest or 
fatigue, and also according to their physiological rela- 
tions ; those under control of the higher centres staining 
in a way different from those which belong to the reflex 
system.t All the prolongations arise primarily from the 
cell-body. Of these outgrowths there are two sorts: 
one, the dendrons, which branch in a tree-like manner 
into the surrounding substance, and the other the neu- 
rons, which have an even calibre and smooth contour, and 
from which the branches arise at right angles. Most cells 
have one-neuron, some have two or even more, but the 
distinctions between these groups will be made later on. 
At its distal termination the neuron divides, in some 
cases many times, and according to circumstances the 
stretch of fibre between the cell-body and this terminal 
subdivision may vary from the fraction of a millimetre 
to half the length of a man; moreover, in many cases 
the neuron gives off small branches near its origin 
(Fig. 20, A), and these branches are apparently of much 
physiological importance. Besides the type of cell 
which forms the basis of the above description, Fig. 19 
shows other forms (& and C), and the question arises as

to how far they are to be regarded as variations of a 
single type. The forms represented by A, Z, and D 
have but a single neuron, that is, are mononeuric, 
whereas the forms & and C are dineuric, having two 
neurons. The branching of the neuron near its origin

is, in this connection, a suggestive feature. The above 
figure (21) shows the manner in which the branchings 
near the origin of the neuron occur in mononeuric cells. 
As can be seen, all the branches increase in number
-P-A-G-E-147
  THE NERVE ELEMENTS. 147 
with the advancing position of the animal in the zoo- 
logical scale, as well as with the advancing development 
of the individual cell. 
Although these relations are easily recognised, it is 
not yet clear in how far all the branches of the neuron 
are alike ; whether, for instance, each acquires the sheath 
of myeline which characterises the medullated nerve 
fibres, though it has been shown that at least some of 
these branches do become thus medullated (Flechsig). 
The current conception of the nervous system de- 
mands an arrangement for the following physiological 
processes. In some way impulses must reach the cell-

bodies within the central system. These: bodies are 
masses of irritable cytoplasm, from which the discharge 
of cnergy may be much greater than that represented 
by the exciting stimulus. This discharge must be 
carried off by some pathway other than that by which 
the stimulus arrived. The simplest arrangement by 
which this is accomplished is the one found in Fig. 22. 
This shows a spinal ganglion, containing typical 
bipolar or dineuric cells. In the usual disposition of 
such cells, one neuron extends to the periphery, and 
there terminates in such a way as to be exposed to 
some form of external stimulus. The stimulus acting  
-P-A-G-E-148
  148 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
on this distal end arouses an impulse which passes 
towards the cell-body, through it, and out by way of 
the other neuron, which in the case of these cells 
extends, as the dorsal nerve root, into the substance of 
the spinal cord, this root being the pathway by which 
the incoming impulses reach the central system. As a 
consequence of stimulation the cells themselves are 
changed, and it is therefore to be expected that the 
impulse leaving the cell would be different from that 
which entered it. Returning to the matter of form, the 
question arises whether the mononceuric cells, like those 
in the cortex (Fig. 21), are similar in fundamental struc- 
ture to the more primitive dineuric cells, and have been 
derived from them. In favour of the view that they are 
thus similar, and derived, a few facts may be adduced. 
These ganglia in lower vertebrates are made up of 
dineuric cells, like those in Fig. 22. This form is 
assumed by the ganglion cells of mammals during their 
early development. In these latter, however, it is not 
permanent, for as growth continues the points of 
entrance of the neurons into the cell-body approximate 
until they come together, so that the cell-body finally 
stands at one side of the passing neuron. The change 
does not, however, stop here. From the neuron the cell 
becomes still further. separated in such a way that it 
appears to stand at the end of a single stem, a stem 
which by its development is composed of those portions 
of the two neurons which were closest to the cell-body, 
and by virtue of its origin this stem should thercfore 
contain two pathways. : 
The transformation can be beautifully seen in the 
developing Gasserian spinal ganglion of the guinea-pig. 
Here the cells when first formed are dineuric, as in the 
fish, and only gradually become modified to the extreme 
forms shown in the figure. It has been pointed out that
-P-A-G-E-149
  THE NERVE ELEMENTS, 149 
the neurons in this instance do not always have a similar 
size, but differ so far that one can be regarded as the 
main stem of which the other is a branch. The impor- 
tant idea involved in this conception is, that the portion 
of the neuron appearing single and passing between the 
cell-body and the point of branching, contains by virtue 
of its origin two pathways for impulses, one going to the 
cell-body and the other coming from it. If this be cor- 
rect, it is but a step to the cells whose neurons have

many branches, yet it must be admitted that but few 
facts are available in support of this view, involving 
as it does the notion that in the main stem the con- 
tinuations of the branches are related to one another 
like isolated wires in a cable. The current explana- 
tion of the arrangement of the cell has been presented 
by Cajal and Kolliker. It is based on the notion 
that all the outgrowths of the cell are primitively 
similar in function. Accordingly, both the dendrons 
and the neurons are to be considered pathways for 
impulses, and the chief difference between them physio- 
logically is assumed to depend on the fact that while’ 
the dendrons convey impulses towards the cell-body, 
the neuron carries them away from it,  
-P-A-G-E-150
    150 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
An attempt to combine these two views, one based 
on embryology, and the other on the histology of the 
adult cell, would lead us here too far afield ; suffice it to 
say that both views assume that the incoming and” out-- 
going impulses travel by separate pathways. Thus the 
suggestion that a given branch may contain more than 
one pathway is supplementary and not contradictory to 
the accepted view. 
Though complete observations are wanting, we know 
in a general way that the nerve elements begin as small 
neuroblasts and grow large, the change in size involving 
all parts of the cell. The increase is at first rapid, then 
slow, but the time at which it,ceases in any given cell 
cannot be exactly determined. It is, however, not pos- 
sible to identify the growing period of all the cells with 
the growing periods of the individual, because the 
histological study of the nerve tissues shows that all the 
cells do not enlarge simultaneously. 
There is reason to think that the nerve cells which 
begin to develop early increase in size as long as general 
growth continues, itself a period of uncertain length, 
while those cells which begin to develop later, increase 
up to the end of the same period. But the dates at 
which development may commence can be far apart, 
and hence the periods during which the cells are grow- 
ing can have very different lengths. The discussion of 
the increase which occurs during development should be 
carried on in the light of all the changes which are then 
taking place. On examining a section of the developing 
spinal cord in which the germinal cells are still dividing, 
it will at once be seen that the germinal cells appear 
larger than the neuroblasts by which they are surrounded, 
and they also have a different character. The nucleus of 
the germinal cell or its immediate descendant is sur- 
rounded by cytoplasm clearly evident on all sides, In
-P-A-G-E-151
  THE NERVE ELEMENTS. I51 
the typical neuroblasts the nucleus is large, and the 
cytoplasm seen only as an accumulation at one pole, 
being drawn out into a slender thread which represents 
. the beginnings of the neuron. It has been shown by 
His, for example, that the mass of the neuroblast was, 
for a time after its formation, approximately equal to 
the mass of the parent ger- 
minal cell; the difference \S 
being that in the germinal 
cell the cytoplasm — sur- 
rounded the nucleus on all 
sides, whereas in the neuro- 
blast it was extended to form 
an embryonic fibre. 
This relation enables us to 
take a germinal cell as the 
unit of volume from which 
to calculate the subsequent 
changes in size. Moreover, 
like the term cell, the term 
neuroblast in this discussion 
will be used to mean not 
only the nucleus with its 
surrounding cytoplasm, but | 
also that portion of the { 
cytoplasm which forms the Fic. 24.—Portion of developing

cell-body by the apparently 
great increase in the cytoplasm, but this is really a small 
matter as compared with the increase in substance repre- 
sented by the elongation and enlargement of the neuron. 
In this latter change the increase in the length of the 
neuron is the more important than the increase in dia-

meter. It is known, for example, that continuous fibres 
pass from the cortex of the cerebrum to the lumbar 
enlargement of the spinal cord, and it therefore follows 
that certain neurons must extend over this distance, 
which, within the central nervous system, is the longest 
distance that is thus traversed. In the peripheral system 
the fibres stretch from their point of origin in the cord 
to the most distant portions of the limbs, and in man 
this is a greater distance than any within the central 
system. In each instance, be it remembered, the fibre 
reaching for this distance is the continuous outgrowth 
from a single cell-body. 
Confining attention to the cell-bodies only, it is found 
that the volume of the germinal cell-body in the cord of 
the foetus as compared with that of the nerve cell-body 
in the cord of the adult, may be as 1 to 100. From this 
cell-body proceeds the neuron, entirely wanting in all 
germinal cells, but which later on may, in some cases, 
acquire a length of three feet. Quantitatively this out- 
growth is the most important portion of the cell ; for 
even when the axis-cylinder alone is considered it may 
have a volume of more than 500 times that of the adult 
cell-body. There is thus developed a relation between the 
cell-body and its outgrowth which is quite unique, since 
the outgrowth is very many times more bulky than the 
body which gives origin to it. It will. be necessary to 
use numerical statements in the subsequent argument, 
and it will therefore be desirable to give a record of the 
manner in which they have been obtained. The unit of 
measure employed by histologists is the micron. Its 
value is O‘00r mm., and its symbol the Greek letter p. So 
far as possible, the following measurements will be given 
in this unit, since the figures will thus be most easily 
compared. In the accompanying table the value of the 
linear, square, and cubic millimeter is given in microns,

and conversely that of the micron in fractions of a milli- 
meter ; also the weight of the milligramme in micro- 
milligrammes.

This table will serve, among other purposes, as a 
reminder of the difficulty of conceiving either very 
small measures or very large numbers ; so unacquainted 
are we with these extremes that most of us have no 
feeling for the correctness of the facts expressed in 
such terms, to say nothing of the difficulty in handling 
them. : 
The growth of the nerve cells may be briefly illus- 
trated by a few measurements. His has determined 
the diameter of the germinal cells in man to be 11 p, 
and the volume 697 » (embryo R-length 5°5 mm., age 
3-3°5 weeks).t The larger cells in the adult spinal cord 
have a diameter of 50 w, and a volume of 65,312 cu pw. 
The ratio of these two volumes is a trifle less than 
I-100, but for convenience we may take the round 
numbers. This liberty is justified by the fact that the 
very largest cells attain a diameter of more than 100 p, 
and hence the figures for adult size given above are well 
within the limits. The larger nerve fibres are Io mw in 
diameter, again a conservative figure, which gives 790 p? 
as the area of the cross section, a relation which re-

  154 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
quires the length of the fibre having a volume equal to 
that of the cell-body 50 mw in diameter to be 828 mu. 
The long fibres passing between the cervical and lumbar 
enlargements are some 300,000 w in length, so that a 
fibre of this size and extent would have 375 times the 
volume of the cell-body just mentioned, the combined 
volume of cell-body and neuron being ‘00245 mm.3, and 
the total weight, supposing it to have a specific gravity 
of 1:035, would be but ‘0025 mgrms.

The measurements show that in mature fibres of 
average size the area of the cross section is divided 
nearly equally between the axis-cylinder and medullary 
sheath, so that in the example given the axis-cylinder 
alone would have a volume 187 times that of the cell- 
body. 
Similar calculations applied to the peripheral system 
of man show in even more marked manner the great 
proportional volume of the neuron, and in the lower 
mammals also analogous relations are found. At the 
same time it must be remembered that there are varia- 
tions in both directions from the,relations just described.  
-P-A-G-E-155
  THE VE ELEMENTS. 155 
In the cells controlling the most distal segments of a 
limb, the disproportion between cell-body and neuron is 
even greater, since the cell-body is smaller and the neuron 
longer than in the example chosen. On the other hand, 
there are within the central system cells the neurons of 
which are so short that they probably have a volume 
even less than that of the cell-body. 
So far as the matter 
has been studied, it ap- 
pears that cells of small 
diameter have neurons 
of small diameter, while 
cells of large diameter 
generally have neurons 
of large diameter, but 
often the relations are 
by no means  propor- 
tional. The two parts 
of the cell therefore 
vary in the same sense, 
but the variations are 
not strictly interdepen- 
dent. Having  deter-

It shows a rapid increase in the volume of the largest 
cells during the earlier months before birth. Between 
birth and maturity the change is slight, and as a conse- 
quence these figures suggest that growth after birth is 
mainly due to some cause other than the further 
enlargement of the cell-bodies most developed at that 
time. 
As a rule, when the size of nerve cells is stated in the 
text-books the measurements apply to the cell-body 
only, and the changes in this are expressed in the fore- 
going table, yet it is desirable to insist on the genetic 
connection between the cell-body and the neuron, and 
so the increase of the latter should be considered at 
the same time. In the mixed peripheral nerve of a 
new-born child the diameter of the fibres, including 
the sheath, was found (Westphal) to be 12-2 pw 
for the smallest, up to 7-8 yp for the largest, with an  
-P-A-G-E-157
  / 
THE NERVE ELEMENTS. 157 
average of 3-4 w. In the adult the large fibres are 
from 10-15 mw in diameter. The enlargement in 
diameter which is thus indicated is dependent on an 
increase in both the medullary sheath and the axis 
cylinder. The history of events is as follows: When 
first formed the axis cylinder is small in diamcter, but 
soon increases. While this is transpiring the medullary 
sheath is formed, and grows rapidly in thickness, after 
which both constituents grow at such a rate that their 
respective areas, as seen in a cross section of the fibre, 
remain nearly equal to one another. The area of the 
cross section of any mass of fibres may therefore increase 
in two ways: either by the addition of new fibres which 
grow into it, or by an increase in the diameter of those 
already there present. This second method is shown 
in Table 34—based on the observations of Birge on the 
second spinal nerve of frogs—where the enlargement of 
the trunk is due to the increase in the size of the fibres, 
the increase in their number not being progressive in 
these instances.t

158 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
    In this latter process the medullary sheath plays an 
important 7é/e. That there are axis-cylinders which do 
not have this sheath is probable, but its presence in\con- 
nection with so many neurons makes it an important 
structural feature, and whatever view may be taken of 
its origin does not alter the fact that it is the companion 
of the axis-cylinder in all parts of the central system. 
The larger number of dendrons possessed by the more 
specialised cells suggests that in these cases there has 
been an increase in the number of channels through 
which the cell-body can receive stimuli, and by conse- 
quence its reactions become subject to more numerous 
modifications. 
Thus far in this description the cell-body and the 
neuron have alone been described, while the dendrons 
have been neglected. However these latter are inter- 
preted, whether as pathways or afferent impulses, or as 
merely nutritive channels, their importance is great, and 
variations in their number and size must be of profound 
significance, despite the fact that their total volume is 
very small. As will be seen by referring to the figures 
taken from Cajal (Fig. 21), the dendrons develop later 
than the neuron, and have also a different morphological 
character. They tend therefore to be more abundant in 
the older cells of the same individual, and in those taken 
from the animals high in the zoological scale. 
In addition to the size of the nerve elements, it is also 
desirable to determine their number, either in the entire 
nervous system or in definite portions of it. If we knew 
the volume of the nervous system at any age, and at the 
same time the average volume of the nerve elements, 
the determination of number would be a simple matter 
of arithmetic. Unfortunately much uncertainty attaches 
to the data which must at present be employed, and the 
results are correspondingly unsatisfactory. Tabulated 
below are some figures which will be of assistance.

In the foregoing table the number of cu. cm. in the 
central system at different ages have been given, and 
then three-fourths of this taken as the volume of the 
nerve tissues proper, assuming that the other fourth is 
accounted for by the supporting and nutritive struc- 
tures. 
Meynert computed that there were 1,200 millions of 
ganglion cells in the cortex of the hemispheres, and 
that there were some ten millions of large cells in the 
cortex of the cerebellum. Adding to them the cells in 
the basal ganglia, the small cells everywhere, together 
with all those in the spinal cord, 3,000 millions would 
be a moderate estimate of the total number in the 
central system. Taking 3,000 millions as a working 
figure, the volume of the average cell (body and pro- 
longations) in the central systems of an adult man is

determined as follows: According to the table above 
given, this system contains .1,005 cu. cm. of nerve sub- 
stance. The average volume of a cell would be then 
one 3000 millionth of this, which is ‘00033 cu. mm., and 
taking the volume of the larger cells in the spinal cord 
as ‘00246 cu. mm., then ‘00033 cu. mm. would be about 
one-seventh of this figure. If, relying on histological 
evidence, it is assumed that the production of cells 
ceases at the end of the third month of feetal life, and 
that the volume of the nervous system at that time is 
about 2°25 cu. cm., the volume of the neuroblasts would 
be 750 cu. w. It was found previously that the germinal 
cells had a volume of 687 cu. yw, or nearly the same 
figure ; the neuroblast soon becoming larger than the 
cell from which it was derived. The importance of this 
calculation is the following: Assuming that there are 
3,000 millions of nerve elements in the central system of 
1,005 cu. cm., and that these are condensed into a 
nervous system whose volume is only 2°25 cu. cm., the 
size of each of the elements is approximately the size of 
the germinal cell, as determined by His from direct 
observation, and the enlargement which each of these 
3,000 millions of elements requires to undergo in order 
to attain the average size found in the adult system 
amounts to but one-seventh of the volume which is 
possessed by the larger cells of the adult spinal cord. 
In order that the nervous system, with a volume of 22 
cu. cm., increase to 1,005 cu. cm., the number of elements 
remaining the same, all the individual elements in the 
central system must increase in average volume (1,005 + 
2°25) 447 times. The largest elements in the nervous 
system do increase 10,000 times in volume, hence the 
average increase here demanded is not large in com- 
parison with that which may occur. Since many 
neuroblasts increase far beyond the average volume

just indicated, there is, in order to account for the adult 
system, not only no need of arrangement for the pro- 
duction of new cells after the third month of fcetal life, 
but it must also be assumed that a large number of the 
elements already formed undergo but a very slight 
development, otherwise the final mass of the central 
system would be far more voluminous than it is. The

    TOR THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
The determination of the number of neuroblasts 
occurs so early in the history of the individual, and 
under such uniform conditions, that it is very difficult 
to regard the environment as possessed of much 
power to cause variation in this respect, and for this 
reason among members of the same race a high degree 
of constancy in this character is to be anticipated. The 
influence of the surrounding conditions becomes much 
more effective during the later stages of development 
that accompany the enlargements of the elements 
already formed, and it is during this period that adap- 
tive modifications may occur.

THE constructive development of the nerve elements 
consists in an increase in size, in the formation of the 
abundant cytoplasm and outgrowths, and in chemical 
modifications which affect differently the several sub- 
divisions of the cell. The cells are first clearly charac- 
terised in the spinal cord, then in the medulla oblongata, 
and finally in the cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum. 
But this modification begins in different groups and 
in different members of the same group at different 
times. Kaiser, in his valuable observations on the 
arrangement of the nerve cells in the cervical enlarge- 
ment of the mammalian cord has made some interesting 
studies on exactly this point.1 His table (36) shows the 
number of developed nerve cells in the similar portions 
of the cervical spinal cord of man at different ages, 
beginning with the foetus at the fifth month,

Thus he is able to show that in this locality the 
developed cells increase in number from the fifth month 
of foetal life to maturity, the number doubling between 
the fifth and ninth months of foetal life, and again 
between birth and the completion of growth. The first 
period of increase probably centres about the sixth 
month of foetal life, during which time the absolute 
increase in the central system is large, and the second 
period in all probability occurs during the first seven 
years of childhood, since by the end of that time the 
central system has attained nearly its full weight. The 
difference in the number of cells observed in the foetus 
of thirty-two weeks and in the new-born child is pro- 
bably not a mere error of observation, but indicates a 
more rapid development of the nerve cells in the former 
case, yet at the same time it has little significance for 
the absolute number which will ultimately be developed, 
because even the higher figure is only a trifle more than 
one-half that representing the total number of nerve cells 
in the adult. To determine the number of cells usually 
functional at maturity, the observations on grown per- 
sons must be many times repeated. There is also no 
direct indication of the age at which the development 
of the nerve cells in man ceases, yet if the changes in the

cortex of the adult, which I shall later describe, are 
rightly interpreted, growth in that locality must be 
going on between the twentieth and fortieth years, and, 
judging from Venn’s observations on the enlargement 
of the head, is extended over the first half of that 
interval at least. 
Much interest has always attached to the determina- 
tion of the time when the central system was structur- 
ally completed. As might be anticipated, the various 
portions are completed at very different periods, accord- 
ing to their functions, and hence all statements on this 
head require to be made in detail. Schiller 1 counted 
the number of nerve fibres in the oculo-motor nerves of 
cats at birth and at later ages. His results are given in 
summary in the table which follows.

This table shows that between birth and matu- 
rity there is in the cat a very slight increase in the 
number of fibres composing the oculo-motor nerve. 
The author explains the slightly smaller number found 
at the earlier ages as due to the small size of the 
youngest fibres, which are thereby made exceedingly 
" Schiller, Compt. Rend. Acad. d. Sc., Paris, 1889.
-P-A-G-E-166
  166 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
difficult of enumeration. The early numerical com- 
pleteness of this nerve is remarkable, and the explana- 
tion of this may possibly depend on the fact that it is 
a nerve with fixed physiological functions, the demands 
upon it being similar at all ages. It is at the same time 
conceivable that nerves whose functions become more 
complicated with age might be, even in the same animal, 
far less complete at birth. It is possible, too, that in 
man the condition of the oculo-motor nerve is the same 
as that found in the cat, yet it has just been shown that 
in man the cervical enlargement of the spinal cord is 
only half developed at this time. 
Still pursuing the questions of number, there are a 
series of interesting facts, which have been determined 
by Birge in the case of the frog. He sought an answer 
for two questions: first, does the number of nerve fibres 
in the ventral roots of the spinal cord of the frog increase 
with the size (age) of the individual? and, second, does 
the number of developed fibres in the ventral roots corre- 
spond with the number of developed cells in the ventral 
horns of the cord, thus presenting the relation to be 
expected if each neuron were the outgrowth of a single 
cell-body? Both these questions were answered in the 
affirmative. The examination was made upon seven 
frogs, ranging in weight from one and a half to one 
hundred and eleven grammes. The total number of 
nerve fibres in the ventral roots of the smallest frog, 
weighing I°5 grammes, was 5,984, or 3,990 fibres for 
each gramme of frog. In the heaviest frog, weighing 
III grammes, the total number of fibres in the ventral 
roots was 11,468, or 103 fibres for each gramme of frog. 
It is plain from this that on the whole as the frog grows 
heavier its muscles and skin have a_ proportionally 
smaller number of fibres controlling them. Taking the

five frogs which were intermediate between these ex- 
tremes, it is found that from the smallest frog up to the 
heaviest each additional gramme of frog is accompanied 
by an absolute increase of about 50 nerve fibres in the 
ventral roots. The following table exhibits the results 
in greater detail.

From these observations-it is concluded that the rate 
at which the nerve fibres are produced in a frog before 
it reaches 1°5 grammes in weight, is many times that at 
which the production takes place in the larger frogs. It 
is certainly remarkable that after this earliest stage the 
rate of increase is quite constant. An examination of 
the figures in detail shows that the increase in the num- 
ber of fibres is greatest and most persistent in the cervi- 
cal group (Roots L, IL, I1I.), next in the lumbar group 
(Roots VIIL, IX., X.), while in both cases the number of 
fibres in the largest frog is more than double that in the 
smallest, whereas in the thoracic region (Roots IV., V., 
VI, VIL) the corresponding ratio is only 1-13. To 
guard against a too hasty interpretation of these results,  
-P-A-G-E-168
    168 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
it is to be remembered that a nerve grows not only 
by the increase in the number of its fibres, but also 
by the enlargement in diameter of the fibres at any 
time present, and therefore the observations on number 
should be supplemented by measurement of the area of 
the nerves at different ages. 
It was further shown that the fully-developed large 
nerve cells in the ventral horns of the frog’s cord, each 
corresponded to a single nerve fibre in the ventral roots, 
and hence the results support the view that there is 
a one-to-one relationship between them. As the number 
of ventral fibres increases, the number of developed cells 
in the cord also increases, and there is thus determined 
for the entire cord of the frog growth relations similar 
to those which Kaiser found in the cervical enlargement 
of man. Some attention was also given to the dorsal 
roots. Birge counted the fibres in these in the case of 
two frogs, as shown in the Table 39.

The frogs are identical with the specimens of 23 and 
63 grammes, the number of fibres in whose ventral roots 
has been given in Table 38. In both cases the figures 
show the dorsal roots to have the greater number of 
fibres, and the rate of increase is 77 fibres for each 
gramme of frog—a rate which is 50 per cent. greater 
than the average rate for the ventral roots. 
There is good reason to think that the fibres in the 
dorsal roots, with perhaps a trifling exception, take their 
origin from the cells of the spinal ganglia. These cells
-P-A-G-E-169
ee ne oe a a ee ae ee me a 
DEVELOPMENT OF NERVE ELEMENTS. 169 
when developed are typically dineuric, and hence the 
number of fibres emerging from either end of the 
ganglion should be equal to one another, and also equal 
to the number of cells in the ganglion. Nelson first, 
and then Hodge, undertook to determine the number 
of fibres in the dorsal roots, and also the number of cells 
in the associated ganglia. Nelson found in small frogs 
the number of cells more than twice that of the fibres. 
Hodge has obtained figures which are similar.2 These 
figures suggest that all the cells which are there present 
have not yet sent out their neurons, and that in the 
larger and older animals the proportion of the developed 
cells in the ganglion would increase, and hence the pro- 
portion of cells to fibres would diminish ; but for this 
explanation good evidence is still wanting. 
By comparison it appears that during early life the 
development of nerve cells goes on more actively in man 
than in the frog, but the difference is one of degree only, 
and, as we shall later see, in the cerebral cortex at least 
it continues in man for a very long time. The data to 
be presented will be useful in interpreting the size of the 
brain, but as a preface to such an interpretation the 
relative development of the grey and white substance is 
first to be determined. 
During early feetal life there is no distinction between 
white and grey matter, the entire system. being grey, 
but with increasing age the medullary substance appears, 
the change first occurring in the cord. According to the 
estimates of De Regibus, the grey matter forms 58°5 per 
cent. of the entire weight of the cerebral hemispheres. 
What is designated “grey” matter in these cases is 
really a mixture of cells and fibres, and the cells,

University of Wisconsin was burned in 1884.

  170 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
excluding their neurons, do not certainly form more 
than one-tenth of the entire weight of a sample of grey 
substance. The cellular portion weighs therefore 6 per 
cent., and the white portion, consisting of the neurons, 
weighs 94 per cent. of the entire encephalon. Employ- 
ing the previous calculations whereby the mass of the 
medullary substance is about one-half of the mass of the 
neuron, then one-half of this weight, or 47 per cent., is 
medullary substance proper. At maturity, therefore, 
this substance alone has a weight nearly twice that of 
the entire encephalon at birth., But no special argu- 
ment is needed to show the importance of this factor in 
the determination of brain-weight. Its quantity is pro- 
bably variable within wide limits, yet the degree of this 
variation has never been investigated. 
That form of forced growth which is called regenera- 
tion, the capacity for which is so early lost by mammals, 
is very remarkable, and will repay attention as a property 
of nerve cells. A distinction should be made, however, 
between the regeneration which involves the reproduc- 
tion of new specialised elements by cell division, and 
the regeneration of a lost portion of a cell by that part 
which still persists. When in a mammal, for example, 
a peripheral nerve is cut, it can regenerate, and this 
regeneration can involve the production of a large 
quantity of material and also be successively repeated 
as many as three times. It is a remarkable function of 
the peripheral nerves, and contrasts sharply with the 
conditions within the central system, where such regene- 
ration does not occur. So far, then, as the central 
nervous system is concerned, it cannot renew itself in 
the sense of regenerating elements, either lost or injured, 
whereas injured peripheral nerves can be repaired. 
From the facts concerning the number and size of the 
structural elements, it is evident that the enlargement of 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
  DEVELOPMENT OF .NERVE ELEMENTS. T7k 
the nervous system is due in the first instance mainly to 
an increase in the number of neuroblasts formed, and in 
the second, to the size which they later attain, and that 
to the increase in size are due those growth changes 
which are usually recorded. The non-nervous tissues 
in the central system are assumed to represent 25 per 
cent. of its total volume, and to have the same proportion 
at different: ages, this being but a gross approximation, 
allowable only in the absence of better data. The in- 
terpretation now to be attempted is based on the notion 
that in organic evolution structure precedes function in 
the sense that the slightly specialised elements are not 
at once utilised, and that a partial development of nerve 
cells may result in their presence in considerable masses, 
without implying a corresponding physiological activity. 
This being granted, the further inquiry is as follows :— 
1. By what means does the brain of the new-born attain 
the weight found in the adult and decrease again during 
old age? The weight of the male child’s brain at birth 
being taken as 372 grammes, and that of the adult male 
as 1,360 grammes, there is an absolute increase of 988 
grammes to be explained. The brain increases in weight 
during this time by the increase of its non-nervous con- 
stituents and by the enlargement of its nerve elements. 
These latter changes are dependent on the increase in 
the mass of the cell-body and cell outgrowths, especially 
the neuron, and in the acquisition by the neuron of a 
medullary sheath. Calculation shows that the absolute 
’ mass of the medullary substance is. the chief source of 
increase in weight during this period. / The weight 
increase in the nerve elements proper is due to the 
enlargement of those cells which at birth are small, 
the addition of new cells being excluded since their 
formation ceased before birth. In answer to the first 
question, it can therefore be stated that between birth
-P-A-G-E-172
172 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
and maturity the increase in size of the brain is due 
in part to the enlargement of the cell elements, but in 
greater measure to the formation of the medullary 
substance accompanying this enlargement. The loss of 
weight in extreme age probably depends on destructive 
processes affecting the medullary substance, accompanied 
by a general decrease in the proportion of water. 
2. Why do tall persons have heavier brains? Individuals 
who are above the average height are, as a rule, also above 
the average in weight, and it would help greatly in this 
inquiry if the histological basis for differences in weight 
and stature were known—whether, namely, they were for 
the most part due to an increase in the number or the 
size of the cells. The cranial cavity and spinal canal 
would tend to be enlarged in cither case, and the size 
of these cavities is one condition affecting the size of the 
enclosed nerve structures. Also it seems probable that 
the variations in number or size would affect both the 
supporting and the nerve tissues alike, and hence that 
the larger central system and the large cavities enclosing 
them are the result of similar variations in both—namely, 
an increase in the szze of the structural elements. 
3. What significance is to be attached to the fact that 
the brain-weight is different in different races ? When 
individuals belonging to different races are thus com- 
pared, it appears probable that differences in the number 
of the cell elements may be of importance, but there is 
no direct evidence on this point, and since in different 
races variations in brain-weight follow in general varia- 
tions in the body-weight, it is necessary therefore to 
attribute the differences to the same conditions which 
are important in the case of the persons of different 
stature, remembering, on the one hand, that racial dif- 
ferences are more marked among adults than among 
infants ; and, on the other, that variations in the absolute 
 
-P-A-G-E-173

DEVELOPMENT: OF NERVE ELEMENTS. 173 
number of cell elements must be determined even before 
birth, at a time when in other respects the individuals 
are most similar. The provisional picture, therefore, to 
be formed of the brains belonging to those races least 
capable mentally is that of one in which the number of 
cell elements is approximately similar to that in the 
most capable races ; but many of these elements being 
but partially developed, the organisation of the brain is 
less perfect, though the size is not thereby greatly 
reduced. 
4. What significance is to be attached to the difference 
i brain-weight existing between men and women ? 
Keith has shown that among monkeys the males 
have the heavier brains. The fact that among mam- 
mals generally the males are the larger and heavier, 
renders it probable that this relation of the brain- 
weight will be commonly found in this class. Whatever 
inference is drawn, therefore, from this relation will have 
an application far beyond the limits of the human species. 
The encephalon in the two sexes has a nearly similar 
specific gravity, and the development of its subdivisions 
‘is in almost the same proportion. In every case, how- 
ever, where average weights have been compared, the 
male encephalon has been found to be heavier than that 
of the female. At birth the encephalic weight is nearly 
the same for the two sexes, and the greater part of the 
differences found between them at maturity is developed 
during the first seven years of life. In macrocephalic, 
large, medium, small, and microcephalic brains the 
weight relation between the sexes is similar, though 
both the absolute and relative differences increase with | 
increasing weight, just as in the body-growth of the two 
sexes. Yet the microcephalic brains are most instruc-

  plexity in the encephalon is assumed to be necessary 
for the maintenance of life. This minimum is pre- 
sumptively represented by the least developed group of 
microcephalics, yet even here the female brains are below 
those of the males in weight, although it must be assumed 
that in both the structural complexity is probably alike. 
If this is so, the difference in weight between the two 
groups must depend on the fact that the structural 
elements in the encephalon of the female are smaller 
than those in the male. What is true of this group is 
probably true of the others, and the size of the nerve 
elements. rather than variations in their number is 
therefore to be regarded as the principal factor in deter- 
mining the difference in brain-weight. Size has a 
double significance here. In the first place, the larger 
cell has the larger proportion of unstable cytoplasm, 
’ more stored energy. In the second, and this is a con- 
dition peculiar to the nervous system, increase in size 
accompanies increase in organisation ; but these points 
will be taken up later. ; 
5. What value ts to be given to the size of the brain in 
different groups ‘of animals ? As has been shown, small 
dogs have smaller brains than large dogs, but in pro- 
portion to the size of the entire animal, the smaller dogs 
have the larger brains. The same is true of any other 
similar group of animals. Moreover, the animals which 
are absolutely the largest are in general the more intelli- 
gent. The explanation appears to depend on the fact 
that the mass of the individual elements is not propor- 
tional to the mass of the body, so that if, for example, 
the cell elements from a middle-sized dog be taken as a 
standard, and those from the extreme forms be com- 
pared with it, those from the smallest dogs will be found 
proportionately large, while in the largest they are pro- 
portionately small. Second, it depends on the fact that
-P-A-G-E-175
DEVELOPMENT OF NERVE ELEMENTS. 175 
those reactions of the central system which form the 
basis for the general intelligence of the species require a 
given complexity in this system, which complexity in 
turn demands a large number of elements. No matter, 
therefore, how small the size of the entire animal, its 
nervous system must possess this minimal number of 
cells, and in the smallest representatives these are of a 
relatively large size. For this reason the smaller mem- 
bers of such a group have proportionately the largest 
central systems, while the largest members have numeri- 
cally the most complex central system, and therefore 
the anatomical basis for a better intelligence. 
In general, then, the variations in the weight of the 
adult human brain just mentioned are best explained by 
regarding them as mainly dependent on the size of the 
constituent nerve elements. The nervous system of 
animals with a smaller brain-weight than man probably 
contains both fewer cells, and of these the developed cells 
are also fewer in number. What the relation is in those 
with a brain-weight above that of man is not known, but 
the probabilities are in favour of the numerical superiority 
of man here also. Before concluding, however, I desire 
to emphasise two points : first, that the explanations 
just suggested apply to anatomical differences only, to 
the mass of encephalon, its physiological capabilities 
being another matter ; and second, that the expression 
of these differences in the terms of the constituent cells 
has the advantage of preventing a too hasty inference 
from the brute figures indicating weight differences to 
the subtle physiological possibilities of this complex 
organ. :

A DESCRIPTION of the form and construction of the 
central system, as found in the adult, must precede the 
study of the important changes by which they have 
been attained. Since the days when interest in such 
matters was first aroused, the shape of the head has 
received its share of attention, and various efforts have 
been made to interpret it. The usual varieties among 
normal skulls are designated as brachycephalic, or broad, 
and dolicocephalic, or long. As a matter of experiment 
it appears that the brachycephalic skulls are more 
capacious, and we should expect this, perhaps, since 
they are most nearly spherical in shape. 
In the dolicocephalic heads the lengthening does not 
increase the volume of the cranial cavity to a degree 
sufficient to compensate for the loss consequent upon 
176
-P-A-G-E-177
ARCHITECTURE AT MATURITY. 1 
the lateral compression. These differences in the 
capacities of the two sorts of skulls are slight, and have 
thus far failed of any general interpretation. Aside, 
however, from the differences in the shape of the skull, 
due to intrinsic causes, there exists a large group of 
artificially deformed skulls. 
By the application of pressure to the head of the 
growing child many races seek to alter the shape of the 
skull. The results are often striking, as can be seen by 
consulting the accompanying Figs. 28 and 29, which 
show some of the extreme modifications that have been 
observed as a consequence of pressure applied in various 
ways. 
These peculiar skulls are of interest because the 
brain conforms itself to the shape of the skull, and 
therefore in such cases the brains deviate from the usual 
form as much as the skulls which enclose them. 
A paper recently published by Ambialet! on the 
deformation of the heads of people living about 
Toulouse gives perhaps the most consecutive account of 
such deformation, and the effect of it on the brain. In 
Fig. 28, 2, is shown a skull deformed in the way which 
Ambialet describes. On the ground that the head of 
the child should be protected from cold, it was formerly 
a custom in this part of France to wind it with a com- 
pressing bandage in such a way as to produce the 
unusual lengthening which the figure shows. The shape 
of the brain is accordingly altered, but there is no indi- 
cation that the number or relative development of the 
gyri is thus rendered peculiar. Provided the child is 
able to adjust itself to the first stages of development, 
_ its intelligence is not noticeably diminished. At the same 
time the brain is thus forced to grow into an abnormal

The average weight of the encephalon is given in each 
table, and for comparison also the normal weights in 
both sexes between sixty-five and eighty-five years of 
age. These later observations were made by Broca on 
normal French subjects, and hence are the most directly 
comparable with the figures of Ambialet. It is seen 
that the “moderately” deformed male brains (average 
weight 1,255 grms.) are slightly below Broca’s figure ; 
whereas the corresponding brains among the females 
(average weight 1,133 grms.) are slightly above. It is 
therefore to be concluded that this deformity when 
moderate is associated with compensatory growth, but 
when the deformity becomes excessive this compensa- 
tion is usually incomplete. 
It is very interesting to find, however, that if the 
hemispheres (mantle plus the basal ganglia) are divided

into their lobes in the manner in which Broca was 
accustomed to separate them, the average propor- 
tional weight of these lobes is similar to that found in 
the individuals taken. as a standard; for the slight 
deviations which are here noted are not of any sig- 
nificance. 
The mode of division is shown in Fig. 30.

Table 42 gives the records as taken from Ambialet’s 
paper, and below in each case similar averages derived 
from the study of normal brains observed by Broca. 
(French subjects, 70-90 years of age.) 
Changes in the shape of the brain are not, as might 
at first sight appear, the result of direct pressure, for, 
under normal conditions, the encephalon is nowhere in 
immediate contact with the skull, but the influences by 
which the brain is reduced below the normal size must 
be those of disturbed nutrition. Even the form of the 
brain is to some extent independent of pressure. For 
instance, the gyri develop on the surface of a growing 
brain, even though the skull has been removed, and 
when one hemisphere has been taken out of the cranium 
the other extends to only a slight degree across the 
middle line. It appears, therefore, that in all these 
instances it is not the mechanical conditions which are 
most effective. 
After the general shape, the bilateral symmetry of the 
central system is the most important, feature. The 
conception is well founded that the plane which divides 
the body into two symmetrical portions divides the 
nervous system in the same way, but in neither case is 
the symmetry perfect. Granting such symmetry to be 
the typical condition, what is to be said in the case of 
persons with skulls which are manifestly very far from 
symmetrically developed? In part such deviation 
shown by the outside of the skull may fail to be repre- 
sented in the cranial-cavity, but in general asymmetry 
without means asymmetry within, and it is to be 
expected that in such: an individual one half of the 
encephalon would be heavier than the other, and that 
the influence of this inequality would extend to all the 
parts with which it was connected. Excluding the cases 
which have just been mentioned, it may be fairly asked
-P-A-G-E-184
  184 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
concerning the individuals whose encephalic develop- 
ment appears to be symmetrical, what degree of perfec- 
tion is thus accomplished. The results of examination 
with this idea in view may be given in two ways: either 
by summing the weights of all the right and left hemi- 
spheres in a given series, and from these finding the 
average amount by which one hemisphere exceeds the 
other ; or by determining the number of cases in which 
the two hemispheres weigh the same, and also the num- 
ber in which one half exhibits an excess of weight.

Taking the simplest method, we have an expression 
of facts like this in the above table (43), where, for 
example, all the male brains weighed by Broca had on 
the average right hemispheres which were 1°93 grammes 
heavier than the left; whereas Boyd found the left 
hemispheres to show an average excess of 3°7 grammes. 
Taking the weight of the male brain as 1,360 grammes, 
then 3'7 grammes is only ‘27 per cent., which is really 
very small. Using the second arrangement, the facts 
are expressed by the following table (44) from Fran- 
ceschi.

  This table does not indicate any tendency of one 
hemisphere to be constantly the heavier. So long as 
the differences are as small as those here noted, and so 
long as different observers obtain results directly 
opposed to one another, as the first table shows, the 
figures do not furnish a good basis for induction. That 
the results of different observers are opposed is perhaps 
to be explained by certain technical difficulties. When 
it becomes a question of passing a knife through a brain 
so as to divide it into two halves, there is found, in a 
complicated form, the same difficulty that presents 
itself on trying to divide a straight line into equal parts. 
Experiments show that in the case of a right-handed 
person attempting this division of the cerebrum by 
drawing the knife from heel to point, the edge being 
down, the tendency is to leave the larger portion of the 
brain to the right-hand side of the blade. Thus it 
would happen that if a perfectly symmetrical brain 
were laid upon its ventral surface, with the frontal end 
away from the operator, and the attempt made to

exactly divide it, the right hemisphere would probably 
be the heavier. If the occipital end were away from the 
operator, the reverse result would follow. Until, there- 
fore, it is reported exactly what method was employed 
in making the division of the brains, it will not be ‘safe

Asymmetrical develop- 
“ment may in certain cases 
be the normal. In one in- 
* stance, at least —viz., the 
cerebellar cortex of the cat— 
an asymmetrical develop- 
ment is a regular occurrence, 
and preliminary observations 
show the same to be true 
for the sheep. In this divi- 
sion of the brain the mole- 
cular layer of the cortex 
shows an average thickness 
in the right hemisphere, 
which is always less than 
that in the left: Perhaps 
this difference is associated 
with the twisting of the ver- 
mis to the right side; and as 
this asymmetrical position of 
the vermis is by no means 
confined to the cat and 
sheep, but appears in other 
vertebrates, we may expect 
to find similar differences existing in them also.

  ARCHITECTURE AT MATURITY. 187 
One general constructional feature in the mammalian 
system is the crossing of the middle line by the neurons 
of many cells. This arrangement brings the cells 
located on one side of a median vertical plane into 
connection with the structures located on the other 
side. This capacity for decussation is confined to the 
elements of the medullary system, whereas the out- 
growths of the ganglionic system remain on the same 
side of the body as that on which they originate. The 
fact that these decussations are completed rather late in 
the growing period suggests why they should be highly 
variable, and thus at times contribute to asymmetry in 
form. Within the central system the decussations of 
the optic fibres and the pyramidal tracts are the most 
familiar examples. The different cranial nerves ex- 
hibit this arrangement to varying degrees, and while 
the decussation is complete in the case of the fourth 
nerve and absent in the case of the sixth, it is partial 
in the third. (Fig. 31.) 
Outside of the central system, decussations are rare, 
but have been described for the peripheral nerves going 
to the electric organ in the torpedo (Fritsch) and in the 
superior laryngeal nerve of the tortoise (Weir Mitchell). 
As illustrating the variability in these decussations, 
Flechsig’s study of the pyramidal tracts in man may be 
cited.t It is known that at the crossing of the pyramids 
certain groups of fibres pass the middle line, and ulti- 
mately enter the lateral column on the opposite side of 
the spinal cord. Others do not decussate at this point, 
but pass into the ventral columns, ultimately crossing at 
lower levels. Flechsig found that practically the two 
extreme cases conceivable might be present, viz. that 
all the fibres might pass into the lateral column or 
* Flechsig, Lettungsbahnen im Gehirn und Riickenmark, Leipzig, 
1876,  
-P-A-G-E-188
  188 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
nearly all of them into the ventral columns. Finally 
the mass of pyramidal fibres in the two halves of the 
cord is in many cases very unequal. No better example 
of variability in construction can be given, and from 
this arrangement it is evident that if there is an original 
bilateral symmetry of the central system it can be 
modified by the subsequent growth processes. 
Besides the division of the nervous system into two 
symmetrical halves there is another manner of dividing 
it, which is of much morphological importance. Com- 
parative anatomy suggests that it is formed by a series of 
segments or equivalent portions arranged in linear series. 
In some lower vertebrates this character is quite appa- 
rent, and opposite to the places at which the spinal 
nerves are attached the cord is somewhat enlarged 
owing to the larger number of fibres which enter the 
cord at these points, and also to the increase in the cell- 
bodies, both in the number and in the size. 
In various ways this primitive arrangement is modified. 
Among higher vertebrates the principal sense organs 
located exclusively in the head assume a greater rela- 
tive importance, and the reactions of the entire organism 
become more and more subject to them. This depends 
upon the fact that the various centres distributed 
through the spinal cord become connected with the 
cells lying at the head end in such a manner as to be 
somewhat controlled by them. These connections are 
mediated by bundles of fibres, which, traversing as they 
do the length of the cord, disturb the segmental 
arrangement. Moreover the great development of nerve 
elements in the cord at the regions where the nerves 
controlling the limbs are given off, causes a very con- 
siderable enlargement, extending through a number of 
primitive segments. As a result of all these modifica- 
tions, the primitive segmental character of the medul- 
lary tube is much obscured in man.

The quantitative relations of grey and white matter 
composing the human cord are illustrated by the follow- 
ing diagram. The curves are intended to illustrate in 
terms of square millimeters the area of the cross-section 
of the cord at the level of each spinal nerve. In this

the spinal nerves. The curves show that, corresponding

in the area of the grey substance occurs, while the 
white substance, taken as a whole, increases in area 
from the caudal to the cephalic end, with a special 
expansion in the cervical region. The united sectional 
area of the nerves show an almost steady increase, 
which is slightly accentuated at the points where the 
nerves for the limbs join the cord.

sent the grey and white matter at different levels in the 
enlarged cephalic end, the area of which in the cross- 
section would of course be many times that of the 
spinal cord. There is perhaps no more striking feature 
in the architecture of the mammalian nervous system 
than precisely this development of the encephalic 
portion, as compared with either the cranial nerves or 
the spinal cord. Special interest attaches to this, since 
there is good reason to consider the better development 
of the cephalic end as an index of greater intelli- 
gence. Plain as this fact isin a general way, it is still 
difficult to express it concisely. For the present the 
data indicating the weight of the cord, as compared 
with the weight of the encephalon, are alone available. 
Though the weight of the human encephalon is superior 
to that of all but a very few animals, the human spinal 
cord is surpassed in weight by almost all the larger 
mammals. This relation, however, varies greatly with 
age. In man also there is found a change in the 
weight of the spinal cord, whereby the adult has pro- 
portionately a larger cord than the child at birth. This 
relation is expressed in Table 45. Table 46 shows the 
relation of the cord to the brain in a series of mammals 
at birth and maturity.

Ir has been pointed out by the older investigators that 
as compared with many animals, the cranial nerves in 
man are small, and that this small size is not only 
relative, but absolute. So far as these nerves are those 
of special sense, it might be thought that the diameter 
of the channel would be important in determining 
their physiological value. As a matter of fact, compara- 
tive anatomy does not support this notion, and physio- 
logy has long since suggested that it is the organisation 
of the elements which form the central termination of 
the afferent fibres that is of greatest importance. In this 
connection is given a chart showing the area in cross- 
section of all the sensory and motor nerves in man. 
(Big. 33.) 
Unfortunately there are no adequate observations on 
animals to compare with these, so that the relations 
between the areas of the cranial and spinal nerves can- 
not be contrasted with those in man. 
There yet remains another way of dividing the central 
system according to certain features shown most clearly 
during its earlier development. This method of divi-

of this separation and the significance attached to it

following diagram will serve to illustrate the principal

This diagram represents a cross-section of the deve- 
loping spinal cord. Within is the cavity forming the 
central canal. The surrounding walls exhibit an inden- 
tation on either side, which roughly divides each side 
into two portions, a dorsal and a ventral. The two 
dorsal portions are the dorsal plates (Fliigelplatten-His) 
and the two ventral por- 
tions the ventral plates 
(Grundplatten-His) of this 
tube. The ventral plates 
~contain all the nerve cells 
whose neurons grow out of 
the central nervous system. 
The dorsal plates contain 
no such nerve cells; they 
receive, however, the fibres 
which grow in from the 
cells forming the spinal

part that has been derived from the ventral plates, while

Examining the encephalon as thus divided, we find

quadrigemina and thalamic ganglia, as well as the 
entire mass of the cerebral hemispheres, are derived 
from the dorsal plates. These parts of the encephalon 
are therefore the homologues of the dorsal horns of the 
spinal cord. This portion of the cord is occupied by

central cells, the function of which is the distribution of 
the incoming impulses within the central system. _ Ac- 
cordingly, similar cells having a similar duty are to be 
expected in the homologous portions of the encephalon— 
a conclusion which is supported by the fact that on 
other grounds just this function has been attributed to 
them. When the nerves associated with these two 
plates are studied, their arrangement is found to be 
equally characteristic. Taking the central system seg- 
ment by segment, the sensory nerves are more numerous 
and have a greater area than the motor. In man, as we 
pass cephalad, the superiority of the sensory nerves 
become most marked, and while the leg with its great 
mass of muscle and extent. of skin is hardly better 
innervated than the arm, the innervation of the small 
muscle mass and skin area of the face is far more perfect 
than that of either. Stilling * has estimated the number 
of fibres in the ventral roots of the spinal cord as 
300,000, in the dorsal roots as 500,000, or 1—1'6, thus indi- 
cating the great numerical excess of the latter. From 
the figures collected by Vierordt it appears that, if the 
olfactory tract and optic nerve be reckoned with cranial 
nerves, as they usually are, then the motor fibres among 
the cranial nerves stand as 86,000 against 2,548,000 
sensory ones, or I-30. When the innervation of the arm 
and that of the leg in man are compared similar rela- 
tions are found. The leg weighs three times as much 
as the arm, and has twice the superficial area, yet the 
arm has nearly as great a nerve supply, and proportion- 
ately the superiority of the arm is greatest as regards 
the sensory nerves (Fig. 33). As the head is approached, 
therefore, there is not only a proportional and absolute 
increase in the number of the central cells occupying

the region of the dorsal plate, but also an increase in both* 
the motor and sensory innervation of the body, especially 
on the sensory side. 
The encephalon is by far the most interesting portion 
of the nervous system, and therefore has been scrutinised 
with the greatest care, even the folds which mark the 
surface of the cerebrum having been studied in detail. 
These folds, or gyri, are separated from one another by the 
sulci or fissures. The questions which have been raised 
concerning this feature are, first, whether the arrange- 
ment of the folds is a constant one, and second, if it is 
not constant, whether any conclusion can be drawn from 
the variations which occur. At one time it was assumed 
that variations in the intelligence could be measured by 
this means, and that there was also a difference in these 
folds according to sex. At present the question is also 
discussed whether certain groups, criminals and the 
insane for instance, have brains differently marked from 
those of normal persons. Finally it has been thought 
that the study of the brains of various races might bring 
out important differences. The accompanying figures, 
taken from Eberstaller? and Schifer,2 represent the 
appearance of a Western European brain; that of 
Eberstaller is the best schema of the lateral aspect that 
has been published. By the aid of such a chart it has 
been practicable to test the questions to which allusion 
has just been made, but these tests have failed to 
establish any constant peculiarities of fissuration charac- 
teristic of sex, race, or social class. 
Since, however, the hemispheres of the Ibi are, in| 
the foetus, smooth, and only gradually become marked} 
by fissures, it is observed that early disturbances in their 
growth, which later are almost invariably associated with

disturbances in the intelligence, are also accompanied 
by abnormalities in fissuration. But further than this it 
is hardly safe to go. On the hemispheres of the human 
cerebrum a number of statistical studies of fissuration 
and measurements have been made. These are mainly 
to be found in the works of Giacomini, Eberstaller, 
Cunningham, and Mingazzinit As the result of com- 
paring the hemispheres in the two sexes, or from the 
two sides of the same brain, there have been noted 
by various observers a number of peculiarities in 
fissuration. These features of the cerebral surface have 
a range and value remotely to be compared with that 
of the features of the face, but they are even less constant 
and less easy to interpret. There are no characters by 
which the sex of a given brain can be recognised with 
certainty ; nevertheless investigators are generally agreed 
that the male brain tends to be more extensively 
fissured. But concerning such matters as the extent 
of the frontal lobe or the relations of the Sylvian 
fissure, and the peculiarities of other important fissures, 
the differences, if general, are too slight to make 
practicable their presentation here. 
With the folding of the surface and the production of 
the gyri are connected several growth problems of great 
interest. Anatomically there are two conditions to be 
fulfilled in the development of the cerebral hemispheres. 
In the first place there must be provision for a large 
number of fully developed cells, and in the second place 
these cells must become physiologically connected with 
one another. It is plain that these two processes do 
not necessarily go:-hand in hand, and we may have 
every combination, from a large number of cortical cells 
adequately associated, to a small number incompletely 
associated. On the number and development of the

cell-bodies the extent of the cerebral cortex is mainly 
dependent, while to the associating fibres is due the 
mass of underlying white substance. A brain possessed 
of an extensive cortex the elements of which are incom- 
pletely associated, can therefore be a much folded brain, 
because the layer of substance forming the cortex is so 
extensive that in order to have it applied to the surface 
of the cerebrum it must be thrown into many gyri. On 
the other hand, the development of the associating 
fibres, increasing as it does the central mass of the 
white substance, gives a larger surface to which the 
cortex may be applied, and in so far tends to diminish 
its folds. 
The significance of fissuration as an index of intelli: 
gence receives no support from comparative anatomy, 
since the brains of ruminants are much more convo-+\ 
luted than those of the dog, while the heavier and‘ 
more intelligent birds have brains that are nearly 
smooth. As has been suggested the fissuration of 
the brain surface depends upon several variables, and 
the problem must first be simplified by analysis before 
a general conclusion is attempted. Precisely at this 
point, failure to recognise the complexity of the 
anatomical conditions involved has led to some 
doubtful inferences. It has been asserted by those 
most interested in the study of the brains of criminals, 
that these brains were theromorphic in their surface 
markings, that is, showed a similarity in this respect to 
the lower animals, especially the carnivora. This would 
imply that such brains had been arrested at some early 
stage. But since the human brain ‘in the course of its 
development does not pass through a carnivorous phase, 
it follows that any such peculiarities are fictitious.t It has

Cerebral Hemispheres, Dublin, 1892.  
-P-A-G-E-202

been also asserted that in the criminal brain the fissures 
ran together in such a manner that the channels formed 
by them are more continuous than in the case of normal 
individuals. It requires still to be proved that this is 
characteristic of the brains of this class, for non-criminal 
brains differ very markedly in the degree to which the 
fissures are confluent. In view of what has been said 
just above, this greater or less confluence of the fissures 
may be interpreted in various ways, and while confluence, 
so far as it goes, indicates a large area of the cortex, it 
may have quite different meanings in large and small 
brains. 
By various devices the extent of the folded surface ot 
the hemispheres has been measured. These measure- 
ments have been made either directly or by determining 
the volume of the cortex, and then, assuming that it had 
an average thickness, by making an estimate of its 
extent. Among the earlier observations were those by 
Wagner, who undertook to determine the area of the 
cortex in the brains of Fuchs, the pathologist, and Gauss, 
the mathematician, and to compare this area with that 
found in the brains of a labouring man and a woman of 
ordinary intelligence. Unfortunately this determination 
was not made until after the brains had lost from 
about 27 to 40 per cent. in weight by their preservation 
in alcohol, and had consequently undergone some dimi- 
nution in volume, so that the figures given for the areas 
in these several cases apply to the brains after this treat- 
ment. Some slight. data are available by which a rough 
correction of these results can be made (Donaldson), and 
thus ‘corrected,? the weight of the cortex appears in 
Table 47.

The weight is a much more manageable measure- 
ment than the area, and has therefore been employed 
in the tables. In normal persons the average thick- 
ness ofthe cortex is not open to wide variations, 
and hence the weights are proportional to the area. 
With these observations are to be compared those made 
by Calori on Italian subjects.t His results are sum- 
marised in the following table (48), which indicates that 
the weight or extent of the cortex in the male is greater 
than in the female, and also that when the brachy- 
cephalic individuals are compared with the dolico- 
cephalic, the former are found to possess the greater 
mass of cortex. Finally, under the direction of Giacomini, 
De Regibus determined the area of the cortex by the 
last method mentioned above. I have compiled from his 
figures the accompanying table (49), but used for their 
reduction constants slightly different from those which 
he employed, thus obtaining, I believe, more correct 
results, again expressed as weights.

So far as these figures show anything, it is that the 
larger brains have a larger area of cortex ; and further, 
that as here given there is a very fair concordance 
among the results obtained by the different observers. 
When it can be stated in what manner the total brain- 
weight is to be interpreted, it will be possible also to say 
what significance is to be attached to the extent or 
weight of the cerebral cortex. In the meantime it is 
interesting to note that of the total area of the cortex, 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
ARCHITECTURE. 205 
almost exactly one-third is found on the exposed surface’ 
of the hemispheres, while the other two-thirds form the 
walls of the fissures. It is evident from this that other 
things being equal, the increase in the total length of 
the fissures would indicate an increase in the cortical 
extension. The relation of the area which is exposed 
to that which is sunken is shown in Fig. 38. 
  
Fic. 38.—Diagram illustrating the extent of the cerebral cortex. 
The outer square shows a surface one-twenty-fifth of 2,352 sq. 
cm. in extent. The inner square has two-thirds of this area, 
and is the proportion of the cortex sunken in the fissures. 
2,352 sq. cm. is approximately the area of the entire cortex in 
a male brain weighing 1,360 grms. 
The actual total area, say 2,352 cm., is something more 
than one-fifth of a square meter. The diagram is one- 
twenty-fifth of the actual area represented by 2,352 
sq.cm. The inner square has two-thirds of the area 
of the outer one, so that the space between the outlines 
of the two squares represents one-third of the area or

the larger square, or one-half the area of the smaller 
one, and is the proportion of the cortex exposed on 
the outer surface of the hemispheres. In the tables 
by Wagner the relative development of the cortex in 
the two hemispheres was noted, and it was found to 
be more extensive on the right side in the case of 
Fuchs and Gauss, whereas in the woman and labour- 
ing man that of the left side was greater. In dealing 
with the extent of the cortex by methods of direct 
measurement, its thickness was not determined, and the 
earlier investigators were ready to admit that an im- 
portant datum was therefore lacking. Since that time, 
however, a number of elaborate investigations on the 
thickness of the cortex have been made. The method 
of determining the average thickness of the cortex is to 
measure samples of this layer from a large number of 
localities and then fuse the results. The accompanying 
table, giving the figures obtained by the principal investi- 
gators, shows that the different observers are by no 
means in accord.t

In all probability these discrepancies are due to

hides place a thinner cortex in the cases of mental 
Among normal individuals my own figures, obtained 
from the so-called American brains, show the greatest 
thickness. Comparing the two hemispheres in the same 
brain series, it is found that the difference is extremely 
smail, and that the figures hardly permit of the inference 
that either the right or the left hemisphere has normally 
the thicker cortex—a conclusion similar to that reached 
concerning the comparative weights of the two hemi- 
spheres. When, however, the average thickness in the 
brain of the males is compared with that of the females, 
there is in every instance a slight advantage in favour 
of the males. The constancy of this difference indicates 
that probably the cortex in the female brain is on the 
average thinner than that of the male; just as on the 
average the female brain weighs somewhat less than 
that of the male. I give here a curve (Fig. 39) which 
shows the average thickness of the cortex at the locali- 
ties indicated on the accompanying outlines. In general 
the cortex is thickest on the convex aspect of the hemi- 
sphere, and thinnest on the ventral and mesal. It is 
also thicker in the middle of the hemispheres than at 
the poles. 
The change in the architecture produced by growth 
and the significance of the constructional elements in 
the general arrangement of the central system form a 
separate line of investigation: to these matters the next 
chapter will be devoted.

A CROSS-SECTION of the spinal cord like that given in 
Fig. 40 will show the /arrangement of the afferent and 
efferent elements, / 
Such a section gives the structure of a modified 
segment of the cord, and since the entire central 
system is regarded as composed of such segments, more 
or less modified at the cephalic end, this structure may 
be regarded as typical. The afferent fibres arrive at the 
centre by way of the dorsal roots, and the efferent fibres 
leave it mainly by way of the ventral roots, but in small 
measure by the dorsal roots also. Toward the cephalic 
end of the cord and in the bulb the fibres carrying the 
efferent impulses, but which do not pass out by the 
ventral roots, become separated and form a lateral root 
intermediate between the other two. The central cells 
not shown in the figure are located in both the dorsal 
and the ventral zones of the developed cord. These

cells are interpolated in the pathway of the incoming 
fibres, and serve to distribute the impulses which they 
receive to other localities within the cord or brain, thus 
increasing the possible number of pathways by which an 
incoming impulse may find passage. Since these cells 
are arranged in series, the impulses which take a long 
course must often pass through several groups of them.

direction of the larger number of impulses. The small 
arrow on the right dorsal root calls attention to the fact, 
that some neurons arising in the ventral plate emerge 
through the dorsal root and convey impulses in the 
directions indicated. 
But concerning the maximum number of times that the 
impulse may thus be interrupted, no definite statement 
can be made. Physiologically, then, the entire central 
system may be regarded as made up of these afferent 
cells, over whose neuron the incoming impulses arrive ; 
of central cells which distribute them, and finally of a 
group of efferent cells, over the neurons of which they 
pass out. It is plain that, according to this scheme, the 
complexity of any given nervous system would depend 
 
-P-A-G-E-211

more on the development of a group of central cells 
than on that of either of the other groups mentioned. 
There is, however, another and more formal way in 
which the structure of the central system can be pre- 
sented. For the original description of this plan we are 
indebted to the Viennese anatomist, Meynert. He 
looked upon the central nervous system as composed of 
three principal masses of grey matter—namely, the 
cortex of the hemispheres, the basal ganglia, and the 
central grey matter of the cord. (See Fig. 41.) 
The fibres which connect the cortex (C) with the 
basal ganglia (Z and S) form Meynert’s projection 
system of the first order; those uniting the basal 
ganglia with the central grey matter of the cord, that of 
the second order ; while the fibres (D.r.and Vr.) uniting 
the central grey matter of the cord with the periphery 
form the system of the third order. In addition, he dis- 
tinguished two other systems of fibres within each prin- 
cipal subdivision of the central system : the commissural 
(¢ ¢), which connects symmetrical points on opposite 
sides of the median plane; and the: associational (a), 
which connects points on the same side. An abundance 
of objections can be urged against the details of this 
scheme, and even some of the fundamental points which 
it was intended to illustrate must be abandoned, but it 
had in its time the value of a good working hypothesis. 
Applying to it the notion of the construction of the 
central system which I think more hopeful, it appears 
that the projection system of the third order includes 
our group of afferent and efferent fibres, and that the 
remnant of the scheme represents details of arrange- 
ment among the central cells, details which are most 
highly elaborated in the encephalon. The relations of

ing their elementary constituents. For the correct 
understanding of their form and mass this inquiry is 
indispensable, since in the absence of such facts an 
effort at interpretation might be fairly compared with an 
attempt to estimate the military power of two nations 
by weighing their armies while neglecting the fact of 
personal strength and courage, material equipment, 
degree of organisation, and the temper of the country. 
As we know from the previous chapters, the nerve 
cells differ widely in the size to which they ultimately 
attain, but at the same time in different portions of the 
central system they exhibit peculiarities in shape and 
structure which are characteristic. It is important, 
therefore, to determine whether any general significance 
can be attached to these differences. _ 
The relations between the diameter of the cell-body 
and that of the neuron arising from it have been pre-. 
viously expressed by the statement that it is correct to 
infer that a large neuron arose from a large cell-body, 
and this relation is useful when search is made for a 
group of cell-bodies to be associated with a group of 
fibres, 
Most interesting on account of their wide application 
would be the facts bearing on the relations between the 
size of the nerve cell and the size of the animal, 
especially when within the same species, varieties widely 
different in size were compared. But such studies have 
still to be made. Strictly speaking, the observations 
alone available show a relation between the diameters of 
the cell-bodies and either the length or weight of the 
animals to which they belong. ‘The size of the cells in 
the same region in animals of different species has also 
been studied. Table 51, taken from Kaiser, may be 
used as an illustration of this latter case. This author's 
studies were confined to the cells occupying the ventral

horns in the cervical enlargement of .the spinal cord. 
The different species of animals which he examined are 
named in the table. The cell-bodies were measured in 
two diameters, and the mean of these measurements is 
given in microns. The record in the table appears 
under two heads, that exhibiting the diameter of the 
chromophobic cell-bodies, or those staining poorly, and 
that of the chromophilic cell-bodies, or those staining 
well. This distinction is important because in the latter 
case the cell-bodies have the smaller diameter. In this 
locality, therefore, the chemical constitution varies with 
size.

On passing from the bat up to man there is an 
increase in the diameter, but this increase is by no means 
proportional to that in the body-weight. While, there- 
fore, the larger animals in this instance have slightly 
larger cell-bodies, there is no constant relationship 
between the diameters of the ce'l-bodies and the weight 
 
-P-A-G-E-215

of the animals. _ We know, further, that the homologous 
nerve cells in the spinal cord of the horse and the ox have 
cell-bodies only slightly larger than those found in man. 
It is necessary, however, to be on guard against the 
somewhat misleading character of linear measurements. 
For example, a cell 53 m in diameter has, when its 
volume is calculated as a sphere, only two-thirds the 
volume of one 59 » in diameter. The slight difference 
in diameter is therefore quite significant when trans- 
lated into volume. 
In this description the expression cell-body has been 
‘reiterated for the sake of contrasting the measurements 
on the body with those which are next to be considered, 
and which relate to the mass of the entire cell. 
Supposing the cell-bodies were even of equal volume 
in the bat and in man, nevertheless owing to the enor- 
mously ‘larger absolute size of the human nervous 
system, the neurons must have a much greater length in 
man than in the bat, making the mass of the entire cell 
many times greater. The converse is true of the largest 
mammalia when their nerve elements are compared with 
those of man, but just how different the relative develop- 
ment of the nerve cells in the different mammals may be 
is still undetermined. Formulating these results, they 
may be expressed as follows: In the mammalian series 
cell-bodies do not regularly increase in weight with the 
increase in the body-weight. On the other hand, the 
mass of the neuron is more closely correlated with this 
body-weight, since the larger the animal the greater the 
length as well as the diameter of the neuron. This 
latter relation is suggestive, for it follows that in the 
large animals a very much greater mass of nerve sub- 
stances, represented by the neuron, is under the control 
of a single nucleus. At the same time it is not possible 
to see that there is any other striking difference between
-P-A-G-E-216
    216 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
the two nerve cells, unlike in the mass of their neurons, 
except that the nerves impulse has a shorter path in the 
shorter neuron. It must, however, be left undecided 
whether a large neuron is either an advantage to the 
nerve cell by adding to the quantity of cytoplasm which 
can store energy, or a disadvantage as representing an 
outgrowth which requires to be maintained.. Perhaps 
future experiments will gain something in definiteness 
if in measurements the comparison be made not alone . 
between. the cell-bodies, but between the volume of 
these and also of the entire cell and the nucleus. 
Mason has studied the size of the nucleus in the frog 
and certain reptiles. His results indicate among the 
nuclei relations similar to those found for the cell-bodies 
of mammals examined by Kaiser. The animals repre- 
sented in his table had widely different body-weights, 
nevertheless there is no correlation between their body- 
weights and the diameters of the nuclei as there 
described. The explanation which Mason proposes is 
based on the connection of the larger nuclei with the 
cells controlling the most active and most bulky 
muscles. Scattered observations on the nerve cells of 
mammals indicate similar relations. 
Physiological reactions and the mass of nerve elements 
are interdependent. Gaskell has emphasised the rela- 
tion between the diameter? of the fibres and their func- 
tion, when describing the bundle of extremely fine 
fibres which in mammals passes out by the ventral roots 
of many spinal nerves, and which he was able to trace 
into the. sympathetic system. It has long been a 
familiar fact, also, that the different tracts within the 
spinal cord are characterised by fibres of different calibre, 
but in order to interpret this it is necessary to compare

fibres of different sizes having the similar physiological 
functions. 
I have made the attempt to determine whether the 
number of nerve fibres going to the segment of the frog’s 
leg above the knee as compared with the number going 
to the segments below the knee bore any relation to the 
mass of muscle and area of skin belonging to these 
divisions, and also whether the nerve fibres were of 
different diameters according to their destination. The 
frog (Rana catesbiana) which was used weighed 13°5 
grammes, the muscles of the entire leg weighed 1'9 
grammes, of which 1°3 grammes represented those above 
the knee, and ‘6 those below, a ratio of 216-1. The 
total area of the skin on the leg was 21°3 sq. cm., being 
65 sq. cm. above, and 148 sq. cm. below, the knee, a 
ratio of 1-2°2, or almost exactly the reverse of that 
found for the weight of muscle. If the area of the 
cross-section of the nerve trunk were proportional to the 
weight of muscle and area of skin taken together, it 
might be expected that it would be nearly the same for 
the two portions of the limb. The following table ex- 
hibits the relations observed :—

The area of the cross-section, therefore, of the nerve 
trunk which supplies the muscles and skin above the 
knee is in the ratio of 2°07-1 to the area of nerve supply- 
ing those below it. The area of the trunk for the parts 
above the knee is thus more than twice that for those 
below. Why? 
By enumerating the fibres which the two trunks con- 
tain, it is seen that the larger nerve is composed of 1,577 
fibres, while the smaller contains 1,949. The nerve 
trunk of largest size contains, therefore, the largest 
fibres, and it is the size, not the number of them, which 
explains its area. To interpret the foregoing data it 
should be remembered that the sensory and motor 
nerves are not equal in number. From observations 
made by Birge, it is calculated that in the nerve roots 
making up the sciatic nerve the number of sensory 
fibres is to the motor in the proportion of 2°7-1. Taking 
this as a basis, and assuming that the number of nerve 
fibres in the two divisions of the leg is proportional to 
the weight of the muscles and the area of the skin, we 
find that there would be 1,451 fibres above the knee 
and 2,075 below, figures which are near to those deter- 
mined by direct enumeration. According to this 
enumeration, the portion of leg below the knee is con- 
trolled by a greater number of cells than the portion 
above it, but the fibres passing below the knee are 
smaller in average diameter. The interpretation of the 
anatomical relations of the nerve supply to the hind leg 
of the frog is, therefore, as follows: The number of efferent 
nerve elements is roughly proportional to the weight of 
the muscles. The cells which innervate the muscles above 
the knee have large cell-bodies and large neurons, but 
they are directly associated with only a small number 
of sensory nerves. The control of these muscles is 
therefore strong and persistent, but coarse. In the
-P-A-G-E-219
  ARRANGEMENT OF STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS. 219 
muscles below the knee the condition is reversed. The 
efferent cell-bodies are small, the neurons small, the 
sensory control very large, and the reactions less strong 
and less persistent, but more delicate. According to 
this view, the refinements of the reactions depend on the 
relations between the motor nerves and the sensory 
group associated with them, either directly or through 
the agency of central cells. It so happens that in the 
case of the nerve supply to the limb these cell elements 
of large size are associated with a group of sensory cells 
small in number, but this is not a necessary combination. 
Taken alone, then, we interpret size in nerve elements 
as the anatomical expression of potential energy. 
Turning to the central nervous system, it is seen that, 
contrary to the arrangement that appears in the inner- 
vations of the limbs, the fibres which in the pyramidal 
tracts pass from the cortex to the lumbar enlargement 
of the cord have the longest course and also the 
greatest average diameter. The length of the course 
here is not so important as the fact that the great 
number of cells in the lumbar enlargement is put under 
the control of the cortex by the aid of a few fibres. 
The control is not refined or delicate in this case, and 
the anatomical expression of this lack of refinement is 
found in the association of each cortical cell with a large 
number of motor cells in the cord. Size here is asso- 
ciated, with coarseness of organisation. It has been 
stated by several writers that the largest fibres had the 
longest course in the peripheral nerves, and hence that 
increase in the diameter of the nerve fibres probably 
facilitated the passage of the nerve impulse in much the 
same way that increase in the diameter of an electric 
wire facilitated the passage of an electric current. The 
large fibres were, however, not to be found at the 
periphery. To explain the absence of fibres of large

diameter from the distal portions of the peripheral nerve it has been suggested that the neuron undergoes a conical diminution, so that its cross-section becomes 
| gradually smaller as it passes away from the central 
system (Schwalbe).t Since 
in the frog, at least, the 
largest neurons can be 
followed into the branches 
which are given off to the | 
different muscles of the 
thigh, a further explanation 
of their absence from the 
main trunks at the periphery 
appears unnecessary. 
These observations on the 
innervation of the frog’s leg 
harmonise with the obser- 
vations of Ross? and of 
Kaiser to the effect that it 
is the smaller cells, and 
those lying at the periphery 
of the various cell groups 
in the spinal: cord, which 
send their neurons to the 
more distal segments of the 
limb. These cells, develop- 
ing late, are known to have 
bodies of small size, and 
since it is found that the 
neurons passing to the more distal segments of the 
limb are small in diameter, there is nothing incon- 
gruous in connecting such neurons with such cell-bodies. The curves to the right have significance as

Numerical relations in the architecture of the central 
system are still to be examined, and to these we next 
turn. Under the title of “The number and distribution 
of the medullated fibres in the spinal cord of the frog,” 
Gaulet has published some interesting observations. 
His view of the animal organism,. metaphorically 
expressed, is that of a complex organic molecule. In 
such a molecule the cell elements of the different tissues 
are assumed to stand related to one another as do the 
atoms in the molecule of the chemist. This conception 
involves the idea that a given number of one group of 
elements demands a corresponding number of another 
group. The application of this notion to the spinal 
cord of the frog is as follows: A certain number of 
afferent and efferent fibres connected with the cord 
requires within it a corresponding number of cells and 
fibres, which shall put the segmental elements in con- 
nection with one another and with the higher centres. 
From the previous investigations of Birge there were 
records of the number of nerve fibres in the spinal nerve 
roots of the frog, and these records form one basis for 
the subsequent calculations. According to Gaule’s 
theory each root fibre, both ventral and dorsal, has 
usually eleven connections, which in certain localities 
determined upon may be reduced to a smaller number. 
By this expression is meant that in the cross-section of 
the spinal cord there will be found eleven fibres for each 
fibre found in the roots. To test this hypothesis Gaule 
made cross-sections of the spinal cord; (1) just at the 
point where it passes into the bulb; (2) through the 
middle of the cervical enlargement ; (3) in the upper 
haif of the thoracic region; (4) through the upper 
portion of the lumbar enlargement ; (5) through the

lower end of the lumbar enlargement. He then counted 
all the fibres in these sections, making the table for 
these localities, given below, and putting first the num- 
ber of fibres in the cross-section of the cord for which 
the hypothesis called, and then the number which was 
actually enumerated, the results were found: to be in 
close agreement.

A great many objections have been urged against 
these figures, nevertheless there is here indicated an 
orderliness in construction which was by no means 
suspected, and which is of fundamental importance in 
further studying the architecture of nerve centres. Ithas 
been urged that the neurons divide in their course. A 
few such observations have been made, but in the peri- 
pheral nerves of man and the frog these divisions of 
the neuron are exceptional. In the spinal cord of fish 
such a division is seen in the case of the giant fibre of 
Mauther, and the same also has been observed in the frog, 
while recently Sherrington has reported “geminal fibres” 
in man. But at best the number of such geminal fibres is 
small. When, however, the branches of the dorsal root 
fibres after they enter the cord, or the branches given off
-P-A-G-E-223
  ARRANGEMENT OF STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS. 223 
laterally from the neuron just after its origin from the 
cell-body, are taken into consideration the case is: quite 
altered. These branches are numerous, and probably 
some of them become medullated, and hence within the 
central system the idea of a one-to-one relationship 
between cell-bodies and neurons breaks down entirely. 
The relation, however, which Gaule sought to establish 
was between the number of root fibres and the number 
of medullated fibres in the cross-section of the cord. 
The figures bearing on this would a few years hence 
have been interpreted to mean that the medullated 
fibres within the cord each stood for a single cell, and 
though at present that is not warranted, it is the inter- 
pretation of Gaule’s facts, and not the facts themselves, 
which are thereby affected. 
The many branches of the cell-body form channels by 
which it becomes associated with other cells, hence the 
manner in which cell elements are related by means of 
their outgrowths is thus brought to our attention. The 
older histologists held that the nerve cells and nerve fibres 
of different origin were often structurally continuous, so 
that one fibre might have similar connections with two 
cell-bodies. Cells joined to one another by broad com- 
missural outgrowths were often pictured, and the con- 
ception of the nervous system was that of a_ very 
extensive network, in which at least large numbers of 
the elements, and perhaps all, were involved. According 
to the modern view, based on embryology, a neuroblast 
gives rise not only to the cell-body, but to all its 
numerous prolongations. These can be followed into 
the neighbourhood of other cell-bodies and prolonga- 
tions, but as a rule continuity between two structural 
units is not described. In the spinal cord of some of 
the electric fishes (Fritsch) the cell-bodies, united by 
broad protoplasmic bands, can be seen, but the develop-

mental history of this arrangement has never been 
followed, and in the light of our present knowledge is to 
be looked upon as exceptional.

tion arises how the physiological reactions of the nervous 
system can be explained without it. By way of illustra- 
tion, it may be urged that there is apparently no diffi- 
culty in the passage of the nervous impulse from the
-P-A-G-E-225
  
ARRANGEMENT OF STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS. 225 
motor nerve to the muscle which it controls, although 
the connection here is secondary. In the same way the 
sensory epithelial cells arouse impulses in the fibres with 
which they are associated, although again the connection 
is not genetic. Here and there in the central system 
nerve fibres are found, apparently terminating in small 
disc-like expansions on the surfaces of cells. In some 
cases the nerve fibre terminates in an elaborate brush, 
which forms an enclosing basket about the body of a 
second cell. In other cases the neuron forms its final 
brush in the neighbourhood of the neuron, or the 
dendrons of another cell. 
On the other hand, it is not easy to make out a close 
relation between the branches of the different cells, 
as they interweave with one another. In many cases 
where it is assumed that the impulse passes from a 
terminal brush of a neuron into the branches of 
another cell, the specimens do not show continuity 
between the two. The difficulty, therefore, is to conceive 
the anatomical relations, so that the impulses may not 
be stopped by interruptions in their course. 
It must be assumed either that these various branches 
are structurally continuous with one another, although 
the continuity is hard to demonstrate; or that con- 
tiguity of these structures is sufficient, the impulse in 
some way passing across the interval; but whichever view 
is taken, the actual relations, as shown in sections, 
require to. be largely completed by hypotheses. As the 
matter now stands, however, the greater weight of 
evidence is in favour of the notion of contiguity. 
Many problems are bound up in this general question. 
For example, an incoming impulse reaches the nervous 
system by one of the dorsal root fibres. These branch 
immediately after entering the spinal cord, one branch 
passing cephalad and the other caudad.

From these main branches are given off smaller ones, 
which penetrate the grey matter. These collateral 
branches, as they are called, may be very numerous, 
and we desire to know whether in each case the impulse 
that comes in by the main stem is distributed in the cord 
through all these branching pathways. Certainly diffe- 
rent reactions follow the stimuli which must arrive at 
the cord by the same fibres, and it is difficult, therefore, 
on the one hand, to see how there should be a choice of 
pathways open to the impulse; and, on the other hand, 
how, if such choice does not exist, successive reactions 
should not be more alike. 
Possibly some basis for an explanation can be found 
in the fact that the series of cells to which these colla- 
terals deliver the impulse may not on the several occa- 
sions be in the same condition, or that the impulse may 
be here and there blocked on reaching the interval 
separating the cell branches, and so at different times 
different groups of cells respond with variations both in 
order and intensity. The following example may serve 
as an illustration of this hypothesis. There is reason to 
think that a given branch or collateral may terminate in 
the neighbourhood of several cells in such‘a manner that 
it is able to deliver an impulse to all of them. If the 
next step in the physiological process depends upon the 
condition of the receiving cells, the greater their num- 
ber and the more open they are to stimuli from other 
sources the more diverse would be the responses. It 
thus happens that the machine-like reactions of the 
nervous system would be best carried out by a small 
number of nerve elements holding a highly constant 
relation to one another and acted on by a minimal 
number of modifying stimuli, while a larger number of 
elements and more numerous avenues for afferent im- 
pulses would permit of greater variations in the reac-
-P-A-G-E-228
228 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
tions. Objectively, one measure of central complexity 
is the modification of the outgoing impulse in response 
to slight variations in the stimuli. Therefore we should 
expect that a nervous system composed of a large 
number of structural elements, well organised, would give 
more highly modified reactions than one which contained 
a smaller number though similarly organised. 
To make plain this view, it must be understood that 
not only are stimuli received through the sense organ 
which initiates a reaction, but we are all the time 
receiving concomitant stimuli through the other organs 
of sense, and as each group of responsive cells or those 
initiating the outgoing impulses can be influenced in 
some degree by any of the incoming impulses, it is 
. evident at a glance that an almost endless series of com- 
binations is possible. For example, a sharp cry may 
instinctively lead us to draw back from its source. If, 
however, the visual impression that accompanies the cry 
arouses sympathy, we draw towards it. The motor 
reaction in the two cases are opposites to one another, 
and they are modified by a secondary visual impression 
accompanying the auditory one. This is a very simple 
case, but it is an easy matter to imagine the various 
complications, when it is also remembered that any 
other sense impression, present or past, may enter in as 
a modifying circumstance. To regard, therefore, the 
nervous system simply as a mechanism capable of giving 
very complex reactions in response to stimuli, implies 
no more than the acceptance of the every-day point of 
view, taken when we venture to predict the actions of 
our neighbour under an anticipated set of conditions. 
It appears that the more complicated the nervous 
system of an animal is, the greater is the possibility of 
those refined adjustments in which several of the sensory 
elements shall play their proper parts, and cach element

controlling the outgoing impulses shall respond in due 
order and with tempered force. 
Taking the nervous system as a whole, and for the 
moment neglecting the manner in which its constituent 
elements are grouped, it has been shown that the struc- 
tural elements do not increase in size in proportion to 
the size of the animal. Yet the spinal cord of a cat 
would not suffice for a lion, nor that of a mouse for a 
beaver, for in the cords of the larger animals, since the 
individual cell-bodies are not so much larger, there must 
be absolutely a greater number of cell elements as well 
as great extension of the neuron to make up their bulk. 
Not only is there an increase in the number of elements — 
representing the spinal nerves, but also in that of the 
central cells and in any such series, the possible com- 
binations theoretically increase far more rapidly than 
the absolute number of the elements. These central 
combinations rapidly increase with'the increasing num- 
ber of the central elements, though the number of them 
is indeterminate, and probably variable. Nevertheless, 
growth contributes to central complexity and organisa- 
tion, and. something will be gained by regarding the 
matter from this side.

From what has been stated already, it is evident that 
the architecture of the nervous system inthe young 
must be different from that in the adult, yet thus far the 
structure at maturity has alone been described. The 
possible causes of the changes due to growth may be 
classed under four heads: alterations in the number of 
the elements ; their size; their organisation ; and their 
nutrition. Since the central system is here considered 
only after the total number of cell elements has been 
formed, no variation due to this factor occurs. On the 
other hand, the alterations in nutrition due to age are 
so inadequately known, that in the absence of other 
evidence, nutritional conditions from the standpoint of 
the individual cell must be assumed to grow steadily 
worse from birth on. There remain, therefore, as impor- 
tant causes, the variations in the size and shape of the 
elements, together with those changes in their relation 
to one another which lead to differences in organisation. 
230
-P-A-G-E-231
  ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES DUE TO GROWTH. 231 
On examining the developing system, the neuroblasts 
are found to be spherical and possessed of one process 
only, the neuron. It would be hasty to infer that 
elements in this stage of development were unorganised, 
since a central system apparently in this condition can 
give complex reactions. In secking an explanation 
for such a case, it should be remembered that if the 
impulses pass between fully-developed nerve elements 
by means of their contiguous outgrowths, then in the 
earlier stages of growth the contiguity of cell-bodies 
themselves might furnish a sufficient though less delicate 
arrangement for their transmission. In the mature 
system, however, organisation depends on development 
of the cell outgrowths. The most important of these, 
the neuron, is the first to appear ; later, the dendrons. 
By means of the former, distant connections are estab- 
lished if it so happens that the neuron pursues a long * 
course as a main stem, having but a few lateral branches 
near its origin. If, on the other hand, the neuron at 
once breaks up into many branches in the neighbour- 
hood of the cell-body, these, like the lateral branches of 
the main stem, are looked upon as the basis of local 
connections. 
Not only ontogenetically, but phylogenetically also, 
the dendrons appear latest. They must, therefore, be 
considered as important to the better organisation of 
the central system. That changes in the size and 
form of the elements usually accompany organisation is 
amply evident, though these changes are not necessarily 
correlated, for a system composed of small cells may 
yet be well organised. 
It has been so long customary to describe the nerve 
cells without much analysis of them, that a number of 
peculiarities in the individual elements have but recently 
* His, Rep, 10th Internat, Med, Cong., 1890,
-P-A-G-E-232
232 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
received proper attention. Among these peculiarities is 
a modification of portions of the cytoplasm for the 
production of the neuron. This differentiation is spoken 
of as polarisation. 
It is probable that all neuroblasts are polarised so 
that the end of a mononeuric cell furthest from the pri- 
mitive surface of the body is that from which the neuron 
grows out, its direction being away from this surface. 
These relations in the dineuric cells have not been 
determined. During the development of a mammalian 
nervous system, many foldings occur, but, provided the 
cells remain fixed, their polarity is preserved. Some of 
the neuroblasts, however, migrate, and the relative 
position of other cells changes in ways unknown. 
Taking all these facts into consideration, it is not 
remarkable that now and then a neuroblast accom- 
plishes but incompletely the series of changes marked 
out for it, and its neuron either develops imperfectly or 
fails to take the proper direction. It is thus possible 
that increase in size in a given encephalon may go on 
almost normally, helped in some case, to be sure, by an 
increase in the supporting tissues, but without the ac- 
companying organisation, a phenomenon illustrated by 
the high weight of the brains of some idiots. It is thus 
seen that the weight and organisation of the encephalon 
are not necessarily correlated, a fact which must modify 
all inferences made directly from encephalic weight to 
intelligence. 
Since the most important and at the same time the 
most distant connections of a cell depend on the neuron, 
it may be considered in more detail. This prolongation 
of the cytoplasm forming the axis cylinder of the nerve 
fibre is usually surrounded by a medullary sheath, a 
secondary structure, the mass of which has already been 
discussed, and found to be correlated with that of the
-P-A-G-E-233
    ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES DUE TO GROWTH. 233 
axis in such a manner that the larger axes have the 
thicker sheaths. A physiological connection between 
the two is thus suggested, and it has been shown that 
with the acquisition of the myeline the nerve fibres 
become functional, a fact which has been effectively 
used to determine the order in which the several parts 
of the central system are organised. Medullation begins 
in the cord and spreads to the encephalon, the local 
mechanisms in the cord being functional before the 
connections between them and the higher centres are 
completed, In general, the elements first developed 
become largest in size, and since the most necessary 
functions presumably are those for which provision is 
earliest made, the relative size of the nerve elements in 
a given animal points to the degree of their physiological 
value. 
In the central system the distance to be traversed 
by the neurons is an important factor, It appears 
that the long distance connections tend to be estab- 
lished early when the low specific gravity, the paucity of 
supporting tissues, and the small absolute size of the 
entire system, all combine to offer the least obstruction 
to changes of this nature. The associations later 
formed become predominantly more local with ad- 
vancing age, consequently the axis cylinder which is to 
make a long distance connection early spans the greater 
parts of the interval between the centres that are to be 
associated, Later, not only is the absolute length greatly 
increased, but it approaches nearer the elements which 
it is destined to control. The first arrangement may be 
considered as a sketch plan of the adult system, and for 
the reason just given the further the fetus departs from 
the first stages of its development the less feasible is any 
alteration in this ffamework. Yet the outlines may 
become heavier, and the few neurons which in the first  
-P-A-G-E-234

instance form them may be later increased by others 
following them as guides, in much the same manner 
that the regenerating peripheral nerve follows by the 
aid of the old sheaths its previous course down a limb, 
although quite unable to force a new passage. From 
the observations of Cajal it appears that the lengthening 
neuron is enlarged at its tip in a way that suggests the 
comparison of it with a growing rootlet. 
Often the axis cylinder acquires a great length before 
medullation occurs, and experiments showing that 
functional activity accompanies or immediately follows 
the formation of that sheath, have led to the view that the 
sheath is necessary for the activity of the neuron. It is 
not possible to make general statements concerning the 
significance of the sheath, for the reason that there are 
fibres which are functional, but in which the sheath is 
permanently lacking, and also because even in the 
typical medullated neuron there is one stretch of the 
axis just after it leaves the cell-body, and others at its 
final termination, where no sheath is found. It there- 
fore is more in harmony with the facts to consider that 
in those neurons usually medullated the establishment 
of the final relations which makes the transfer of the 
nerve impulses possible, is the prime event, and that this 
is accompanied by the physiological change leading to 
medullation, a change which in these cases is an index 
of organisation. For the absence of this sheath in 
certain classes of nerves, and in portions of others, no 
explanation has been offered. 
~ In one way the final approximation of the cell out- 
growths, accompanied by medullation, is the most 
important condition modifying brain architecture, but it 
is by no means so evident as the grosser changes which 
accompany it.’ 
Preceding medullation for the most part, none among

on 
these changes is more striking than that produced by the 
formation of the gyri of the cerebral hemispheres. Up 
to the fifth week of foetal life the hemispheres are 
smooth. Then appear the transitory fissures, caused by 
the infolding of the entire thickness of the wall of the 
hemispheres, a process which has been attributed by 
Cunningham? to inequality in growth caused by the 
over-rapid enlargement of the encephalon as compared 
with that of the cranium. This inequality is soon 
relieved by proportionate expansion of the cranial 
bones, and almost all the transitory fissures disappear, 
one, or perhaps two, remaining. The next formation of 
gyri, which begins about the twentieth week with the 
appearance of the central fissure, does not involve the 
entire thickness of the hemispheral wall, but is due to a 
retardation of growth along the line of the future 
fissures. In the growing cerebrum both the bottoms of 
the fissures, as well as the summits of the gyri which 
limit them, move away from the geometric centre of the 
brain, the latter more rapidly, and hence the fissures 
first formed become gradually deeper so long as the 
brain continues to enlarge. Variations in the rate at 
which the radii of the several portions of the cortex 
elongate become more numerous as the brain grows 
larger, so the number and extent of the fissures is also 
increased. The causes of this change are but poorly 
understood. Both the radial fibres that grow into the 
cortex, as well as those that grow out from it, must have 
an influence, and probably an important one, since they 
are the fibres by which it is most affected, while the various 
sorts of non-radial fibres are of hardly less significance. 
One effect of this fissuration is to increase the surface of 
the cortex, a change which must be accompanied by a

lengthening of all the fibre systems that run parallel 
with its surface. 
These conditions being complex, it follows that the 
character of the fissuration may vary greatly in con- 
sequence of a slight alteration in them, and nearly 
the same gross appearance be the result of dissimilar 
combinations among them. For instance, a much- 
fissured surface may*be the result either of an ample

expansion of the cortical layer, or a lack in the forma- 
tion of the subcortical fibres. 
The fibres in the encephalon become only slowly medul- 
lated, so that from birth to maturity there is an increase 
of the portion medullated. Engel! has shown this in 
the case of the cerebellum. When a section in the median 
plane is made through the cerebellum there is exposed 
a central mass of white matter, having many branches, 
and surrounded by the grey cortex. This “arbor vite,” 
as it has been called, from its resemblance to the foliage 
of the tree bearing that name, changes in shape, and at

maturity acquires longer and more numerous branches, 
which may be lost again under pathological conditions. 
In Fig. 45 are given the outlines of the arbor vite as 
observed by Engel. 
The cortical layers both in the cerebrum and cere- 
bellum grow thicker as the brain increases in size. The 
studies of Krohn on the cerebellar cortex of the cat 
show the molecular layer to be thicker in the cat of six 
months than in the kitten of three months.

Probably the thickness of the cerebral cortex in- 
creases so long as any of its layers continue to grow in 
thickness, and there is reason to think that this may go 
on up to the fortieth year. The development of the 
cortex is very instructive, and is illustrated by the 
accompanying figures, based on those by Vignal.t 
In the foetus of the twenty-fourth week small granule- 
like cells, arranged in vertical rows and closely packed 
together, form the bulk of this layer. In the twenty- 
eighth week it has increased in thickness, the ceils have

become somewhat stratified, and in the lower portion of 
the layer (A, III) have begun to show the full charac- 
ters of nerve cells, a nucleus, nucleolus, and well-marked 
cytoplasm. A month later (2) cells have begun to 
develop through the entire thickness of the cortex, the 
clearly marked cells have become larger, and the 
elements have further separated. The failure of the 
cortex to increase in thickness during this time may be 
associated with the fissuration of the hemispheres which 
causes an extension of the surface. At birth the thick- 
ness is much increased, more cells are developed, and 
those previously enlarged have increased in size. Be- 
tween this and maturity an increase in thickness is not 
shown in the figures, but equally important is the 
change in the extension of the cortex, which at birth 
covers an encephalon weighing only 382 grammes, to 
an area which will cover one weighing 1,350 grammes ; 
added to which is the further extension demanded by 
the deepening of the fissures, since the entire area at 
maturity amounts to more than three times that found 
at birth. It is no wonder, then, that the cortical 
elements become still further separated. 
For the cells continually appearing in the developing 
cortex no other source is known than the nuclei or 
granules found there in its earliest stages. These 
elements are metamorphosed neuroblasts which have 
shrunken to a volume less than that which they had at 
first, and which remain small until, in the subsequent 
process of enlargement necessary for their full develop- 
ment, they expand into well-marked cells. Elements 
intermediate between these granules and the fully 
developed cells are always found, even in mature brains, 
and therefore it is inferred that the latter are derived 
from the former. The appearances there lead also to 
the conclusions that many elements stop short of com-

plete development, that the number of elements which 
might possibly develop in any given case is far beyond 
the number that actually does so, and that the charac- 
teristic appearance of the cortex in the various localities 
depends in a measure on the expansion of dissimilar 
layers of the primitive granules. 
Just here can be met a difficulty sometimes felt in the 
explanation of these changes. . It has been urged that 
the possible number of cells latent and functional in 
the central system is early fixed. At any age this 
number is accordingly represented by the granules as 
well as by the cells which have already undergone 
further development. During growth the proportion of 
developed cells increases, and sometimes, owing to the 
failure to recognise potential nerve cells in the granules, 
the impression is carried away that this increase implies 
the formation of new elements. As has been shown, 
such is not the case. 
These conclusions require to be tested further, but 
bearing on them is the fact that the number of granules 
and partially developed cells was excessive in the defec- 
tive portions of the cortex of the blind deaf-mute, Laura 
Bridgman, in whom normal development in these localities 
ceased at the end of the second year of life (Donaldson), 
and similar appearances have been found in the cortex of 
persons congenitally defective. Applying these ideas to 
the comparative anatomy of the cortex, there is reason to 
think that in passing down the zoological scale the pro- 
portion of undeveloped elements would increase, and for 
this there is positive evidence. It is conceivable, too, 
that in the case of man wide individual variations in the 
proportion of developed granules may occur, and with 
it would come corresponding differences in the organisa- 
tion of the cerebrum, without much alteration in its 
absolute weight. If the history of the cortex up to

maturity is followed with care, changes of great interest 
are to be discerned, and these changes are apparently 
open to much individual variation. Their importance 
is enhanced by the fact that on the one hand the cortex 
is the most complicated group of the central cells by 
which cross references between incoming and outgoing 
impulses are established, and on the other by the fact 
that the changes in question have been shown to occur 
during the period of formal education, and may there- 
fore be in some measure influenced by it. The accom- 
panying diagram represents on one side in a schematic 
manner the distribution of the cells in the occipital 
region of the human cortex, and on the other the 
arrangement of the fibres. The facts which are to be 
presented bear on the relative development of these 
layers of fibres as indicated by their increasing medul- 
lation (Fig 47). 
The change with age in the number of tangential 
medullated fibres or those running parallel with the - 
* cortical surface has been studied by Vulpius.t For the 
purpose of this investigation, the cortex was divided 
into three layers, an outer (A, 4, C and outer half of D), 
middle (J, inner half), and inner (Z to // inclusive), repre- 
sented respectively by the layers I, II; III, and IV, 
to VIII in Fig. 47. The proportional number of the 
fibres was determined by counting them in a small area. 
Six localities in a large number of brains ranging in 
age between the thirty-second week of fcetal life and 
seventy-nine years were studied. The results are par- 
tially summarised in the two figures which follow, in 
which is recorded the proportional development of 
tangential fibres under the conditions named. The 
figures show that between the age of sixteen months 
and thirty-three years the number of fibres in all the

layers has increased, and this too despite the fact that 
the individual fibres have grown larger. At the first 
age the number is greatest in the anterior central gyrus 
and the parts behind it. The increase is greatest in the 
outer layer, next in the middle, and least in the inner 
one, so that, according to this, the increase in the 
number of fibres progresses from the deepest layer 
towards the surface. When, on the other hand, the 
development at each locality is followed through a 
number of years, a different, though concordant, series 
of changes is observed, and these are shown in the 
three tables given below. 
Chart C, F.3s., is a region late to develop, and the 
growth there is even and regular. Chart D, V.C.d., 
shows a region well developed at an early age, and 
since, therefore, the period for this is probably variable, 
it is not surprising that the curve is uneven ; while Chart 
E, T.1s., develops more slowly and is again regular. The 
proportionate increase in the several layers is greatest 
for those that begin earliest. In the motor areas (F.3s. 
and V.C.d.) there is a decrease in the number of fibres 
_after the thirty-third year, this being most marked in 
V.C.d. In T.1.s. this diminution is delayed. 
In the new-born child, Vulpius found no medullated 
fibres in the cortex. In the white substance of the 
anterior central gyrus alone some medullated fibres 
were found. The first tangential fibres appear in the 
inner and outer layers of a child at four and a half 
months and in the middle layer at eight months. 
Along this same line are the observations of Kaes,* 
who directed attention principally to the layers II and 
and III, Fig. 47 (the middle layer of Vulpius), and aimed 
to determine how late in life increase in the medullated 
fibres could be here followed. His method was ta

measure the thickness of the layers in question, and 
some differences between his results and those of 
Vulpius probably depend on the fact that owing to 
condensation, the number of fibres in a limited area does 
not always run parallel with the absolute thickness of 
the layer formed by them. 
. The medullation is greater in brains of individuals 
between 38-45 years than in that of a youth of eighteen; 
so that somewhere in this interval further growth occurs, 
and from Vulpius we see that it is continued up to at 
least the thirty-third year. In stained sections in which 
the layers appear grey, yellow-grey with dark lines,

as. regards the layers in question. The fibres were a 
trifle more abundant in the occipital than the frontal 
portions. The cortex of the dorsal surface was most 
developed, that of the ventral least, and the mesal 
surface was intermediate between these two. The 
dorsal surface reaches full development first, and the 
other surfaces follow in the order named. The develop- 
ment is often very local, and there is by no means a 
uniform character common to large areas.

There can be little doubt that changes similar to these 
affect the other portions of the encephalon, although it 
is not possible at the moment to bring forward direct 
proof of this. It is evident from these facts that the 
organisation and therefore the details of the architecture 
of the central system are continually being modified 
through life. Somewhere beyond maturity retrogressive 
changes begin, but the few facts which exist on this 
phase of growth may be conveniently deferred until the 
discussion of old age.

IF we picture the entire nervous system of man com- 
posed of a central axis from which nerves pass to all 
the portions of the body, we shall have the basis from 
which to start the present inquiry (see Fig. 50). 
The roots here represented as arising from the central 
axis caudad to the pons, contain fibres which transmit 
not only afferent, but efferent impulses. The fibres 
which give sensibility to any part, enter the central 
system near the point from which emerge those that 
control its movements. As might be expected, there- 
fore, the parts to be controlled are most directly under 
the influence of the afferent stimuli which arise in their 
immediate neighbourhood. This arrangement recalls 
the segmental structure of the central system, whereby 
both the sensory and motor nerves belonging to a given 
segment of the body are localised in a corresponding

that the portions of the 
central system with 
which a segmental pair 
of nerves was con-

portion in which oc- 
curred the principal 
central adjustments 
concerned with this 
pair, but the question 
remained as to the 
significance of those 
portions of the central 
system which are more 
elaborated and are 
not so plainly _seg- 
mental. Itis naturally 
asked whether these 
parts, such as the cere- 
bellum, for instance, 
are exclusively asso- 
ciated with the nerves 
which join the axis in 
their immediate neigh- 
bourhood, or whether 
they have wider and 
more general connec-. 
tions. 
We have seen reason 
to think when examin- 
ing the phylogenetic

down the initial segmental arrangement by conden- 
sation, in such wise that groups of centres might act in 
concert and at the same time any one of them be 
brought under the combined control of several sense 
organs. In discussing the ideas of localisation which 
have developed around these observations, it will be 
desirable to restrict ourselves here mainly to that side 
of the question which: will throw most light upon the 
architecture of the central nervous structures. 
The architecture has already been examined from the 
anatomical point of view, as well as embryologically ; 
and it has been pointed out that probably the larger 
divisions of the encephalon, which are of such interest 
to us, are the homologues of that region in the spinal 
cord which forms the dorsal horns and contains a large 
proportion of the central cells. It remains to be 
determined how pathways for incoming impulses are 
there related to those for outgoing ones, and it is in this 
direction that the physiological experiments yield facts 
which can be utilised. 
But, in the first instance, the problem may be dealt 
with in a purely statistical manner. Belonging to the 
spinal cord there are thirty-one pairs of nerves by which 
impulses enter and leave it. There are also enumerated 
within the cranium twelve pairs of nerves, of which six 
are predominantly pathways for incoming impulses, and 
the other six for those outgoing. I say predominantly, 
because, as a matter of fact, in the optic and olfactory 
pathways there are also some fibres which transmit 
outgoing impulses. Such being the formal arrange- 
ment by which the central system is connected with the 
other parts of the body, we may study a given locality 
in it with a view to obtaining further details. 
Some idea of the central connection of the nerve 
roots can be got from the arrangement of the motor  
-P-A-G-E-252
  252 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
nerves in the spinal cord and from their relations to 
the muscles of the limbs. The same muscles may be 
thrown into contraction by stimulating any one of 
several of the motor roots. If, then, the group of 
cells giving rise to these fibres is designated as the 
nucleus for the nerve fibres controlling that muscle, it 
is found that such a nucleus may extend through several 
spinal segments, and that the muscles used in the fine 
adjustments at the extremity of the limb, those of the 
hand, for instance, have in the cord extensive nuclei. 
It appears that by thus drawing into a long column a 
group of cells which gives rise to the controlling fibres, 
the muscle is not only put under the direction of a large 
number of efferent cells, but that since these cells are 
located at various levels, special groups of them are 
directly accessible to different incoming impulses ; and 
thus the co-ordinated responses of the muscles are 
refined. What has been said strictly applies only to 
the cells giving rise to the efferent fibres. Concerning 
the distribution of the afferent fibres, there is much less 
exact information. On this side, however, two relations 
are well established : first, that by way of the afferent 
fibres, impulses may directly reach the nuclei of the 
efferent nerves ; and second, that also by way of them, 
impulses may reach these cells vééd the cerebral hemi- 
spheres, usually the hemisphere of the opposite side. 
The accompanying figure illustrates this relation. 
The principal path followed by these impulses on 
the way to the higher centres is either along the 
dorsal columns of the cord, on the same side as 
far as the lower end of the bulb, where the im- 
pulses, having passed to a new set of cells, cross to 
the opposite side of the axis and terminate in the 
corresponding hemisphere ; or across the median 
plane to the lateral column, and so cephalad to the |
-P-A-G-E-253

corresponding hemisphere. 253 
in this crude manner the 
impulses may be pictured as distributing themselves 
within the central system by means of the incoming 
fibres and their colla- 
teral branches, aided 
-by the central cells. 
The expansion of the 
nucleus of a motor 
nerve throughseveral 
segments is, by com- 
parison, centralisa- 
tion in a high degree 
when contrasted with 
the manner in which 
a sensory pathway 
thus extends itself 
over a large part of 
the central system. 
“It is well to bear in 
mind that the cranial 
nerves, so far as they 
mediate afferent im- 
pulses, have, like the 
sensory nerves of the 
spinal ‘cord, primary 
centres at the points 
where they terminate 
in the axis, and that 
from those primary 
centres they  esta- 
blish secondary con- 
nections with the 
cerebral hemispheres. 
They resemble the

-P-A-G-E-255
  LOCALISATION OF FUNCTION. 255 
those forms in which cephalisation is but little advanced 
the primary centres of the cranial nerves when alone 
present may assume a guiding control over the re- 
mainder of the system. It thus happens that a frog 
after loss of the cerebral hemispheres can still direct its 
jumping movements so as to avoid a visible obstacle in 
its path ; in other words, impressions reach the central 
system of such a frog through its eyes, and these impres- 
sions influence the reactions of the muscles of hind legs 
despite the absence of the hemispheres. In man,on the 
other hand, the parts of the brain corresponding to the 
optic lobes of the-frog do not tepresent a locality in 
which such connections are established, so that in him 
the hemispheres alone do the work which in the less 
specialised form may be performed by the lower 
centres. In this connection we naturally inquire how 
the cerebral hemispheres may have acquired in the higher 
vertebrates capabilities which belong to them in a less 
and less degree as we descend from man through the 
zoological scale. In the higher forms it appears that 
the incoming impulses, instead of passing over in the 
primary centres to cells which discharge downwards, 
pass to a group of afferent ‘central cells which carry 
impulses to the cortex, that with the organisation of 
this second pathway the first becomes less passable, and 
thus the function is transferred, though the causes 
determining the growth of the central cells on which 
the change depends are still obscure. 
One difficulty felt by all who have touched this 
problem of localisation is due to the very large portion 
of the encephalon, especially in the cerebrum, to which 
our observations.and conclusions have not yet been 
applied. At first explanation is incommoded by the 
existence of these enigmatic parts, but only too readily 
do we neglect what cannot be easily explained, and by
-P-A-G-E-256

so doing really hamper further advance. The partial 
character of the explanations which are to be given 
should therefore be kept in mind. P 
The tracts connecting the hemispheres with the spinal 
cord, and bearing incoming impulses, run mainly 
through the dorsal portions of the central axis. On

fibres (see Fig. 61). The relations of the fibre bundles 
in the capsule are sometimes so described as to leave 
the impression that this is the sole portion of the capsule 
in which such afferent fibres occur. More probably, 
however, they are distributed through its entire extent 
because the method of distribution in the cortex, like 
that for the spinal cord, is such that the fibres bringing 
afferent impulses terminate in the neighbourhood of 
cell-bodies whose neurons control the centres for the 
related muscles, and further, because the general group- 
ing of the fibres in the internal capsule itself is in the 
main similar to the grouping in the cortex. The distri- 
bution of the incoming fibres is consequently such that 
a large portion of the cortex must receive them, and, 
judging from its reactions to stimuli, an equally large 
region must contain cells giving rise to outgoing 
impulses. The same reactions which lead to the con- 
clusion that the incoming impulses are brought to the 
surface of the cerebrum lead also to the conclusion that 
at this point they pass from one set of nerve cells to 
another, and that this second set discharges towards the 
lower lying centres. Thus there is indicated an 
arrangement by which at the cortex the direction of 
the nervous impulse is exactly reversed. Such changes 
of direction may occur in any centre, but the peculiarity 
of the cortex from the standpoint of physiology consists 
in the extension over a broad surface of these turning- 
points for the nerve impulses, an extension which par- 
ticularly adapts the cortex for experimental study. 
Granting these points, it is not surprising to find that in 
a certain sense the entire cortex, so far as it responds 
directly, is motor, so that the stimulation of it’ at 
different points will give rise to muscular contractions. 
This close association of the two groups of elements 
brings it to pass also that in the case of the regions

  Fic. 55.—Brain of the macaque monkey, showing the sensory and

it. The uppermost figure gives a lateral view of the hemi- 
sphere and the lowest a mesal view. (Beevor and Horsley, 
from Foster’s Physiology.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
260 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
devoted to special senses, like sight, hearing, and 
smell, the immediate motor reactions which arise from 
the stimulation of these areas occur in the muscles con- 
trolling the corresponding external sense organs, On 
the other hand, the mass of muscles which has for its 
principal sense organ the skin, is by comparison with 
the muscles of the external sense organs very large, and 
the locality from which the reaction of the former can 
be obtained is so elaborated that this region has been 
called motor, to distinguish it by contrast from the other 
regions designated as sensory. Such designations, 
therefore, as motor or’ sensory are misleading, and 
although the sensory side in one locality may be most 
highly developed, and the motor in another, yet in all of 
them are to be found pathways for both incoming and 
outgoing impulses. 
Before discussing the cortical areas in detail, these 
great regions, as they appear in the brains of the 
monkey (and probably of man), should be described. 
The monkey is chosen for comparison because the 
most important experiments which have been made in 
this direction have been upon a species of macaque 
(Macacus sinicus), and though in a general way the 
relations in this animal are similar to those in other 
monkeys and in man, yet, as there are variations in 
detail, it is well to remember the species of animal which 
has been employed. Fig. 55 shows the relation of the 
motor and sensory centres in this monkey as determined 
by Horsley. 
Asa matter of convenience regions may be termed 
motor or sensory, if only it is remembered that by these 
terms we indicate the more evident rather than the ex- 
clusive character there found. There are two peculiarities 
in the distribution of the motor areas in the monkey 
which are worthy of remark, In the first place, a large
-P-A-G-E-261
LOCALISATION OF FUNCTION. 26r 
proportion of the convex surface of a hemisphere is 
devoted to the control of the muscles whose sense organ 
is the skin, and in the second place, this area extends 
on to the mesal surface of the hemispheres. If we com- 
pare with this the arrangement in the brain of the orang, 
we find the motor areas in question more concentrated 
about the central fissure, or fissure of Rolando (the long 
fissure on either side of which they are seen to lie in 
Figs. 55 and 56). 
Comparing the arrangement in the monkey with that 
in the orang, it is found that the proportion of the 
cerebral cortex devoted to these areas is smaller in the 
‘orang, and that within the larger areas, at least, there 
are spots the stimulation of which does not yield any 
reaction. The experimental determination of these 
areas made on the brain of man are of course few in 
number. So far as they go, they indicate that in this 
respect the human brain shows an increase in the con- 
centration and isolation of these areas, and of the centres 
within them. There is certainly no more important 
feature of the whole subject of localisation than this 
concentration in man and the higher apes, but it may 
be for the moment disregarded while the characters 
which these areas have in common are first described. 
As might be expected, the homologous portions of 
the cortex in man and the apes are occupied by similar 
centres. The motor regions, for example, are grouped 
in all cases about the central fissure. The area for vision 
is in the occipital lobe, and that for hearing in the tem- 
poral. Not only does this general distribution show 
similarities with that in other mammals, but the simi- 
larities extend to many details. 
The areas for the different portions of the body are so 
distributed in the motor cortex that those controlling 
the muscles of the head and neck lie most anteriorly,
-P-A-G-E-262
  252 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
while those controlling the muscles of the leg and foot 
lie most posteriorly, with the areas for the upper. arm 
and trunk between them. The actual relation of these (Beevor and Horsley.) 
Fic, 56.—Lateral view of the left hemisphere of an Orang-utang, showing the motor

  areas is certainly not perfectly schematic, but there is 
sufficient order among them to warrant the statement 
that the nerves bringing impulses from the sensory areas 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
  LOCALISATION OF FUNCTION. 263 
widely separated on the surface of the body tend to be 
distributed in widely separated portions of the cortex. 
This relation between the larger areas is repeated in a 
very remarkable way by the smaller centres composing 
them. It is there found, as can be seen by consulting 
‘the diagram, Fig. 55, that the point of the cortex, the 
stimulation of which gives rise to movements of the 
muscles controlling the most proximal joints of a limb, 
the shoulder, for example, is farthest separated from the 
portion which controls the most distal joints, those of 
the fingers, and that the intermediate joints are repre- 
sented by centres lying between them. In this respect, 
also, the separation of parts at the periphery of the body 
is accompanied by a corresponding separation in the 
cortex. 
The division of the motor areas, according to the 
segment of the limb in which the movement is initiated, 
is, however, but one way of dividing’ them. An ex- 
tremely suggestive subdivision is that made according to 
the general character of the movements following its 
excitation, these movements being classified as those of 
extension, confusion, or flexion. In the arm area it is 
found to be the upper and frontal part which most 
readily gives rise to movements of extension, while the 
lower and occipital portion gives rise to those of flexion, 
an area for confused movements lying between them, and 
this separation of opposite movements probably holds 
for those of the leg area also. 
The more carefully the relations of the cortex to the 
lower centres are studied the plainer it becomes that the 
impulses which pass down from it act on them as but 
one of several groups of stimuli, comparable with those 
arriving directly from the periphery, and subject to modi- 
fications by them. The cortical centres do not usually 
control individual muscles, but groups of muscles, the con-
-P-A-G-E-264
  264 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
traction of which results in co-ordinated movements, and 
thus the nature of the reaction taking place in conse- 
quence of the cortical discharge is modified first by 
alterations of the initial stimulus during its passage 
through the cortex, and second, by the conditions of the 
lower centre as determined by impulses arriving from 
other sources. 
Granting the relation here suggested, we are prepared 
  Fic. 57.—Showing the localisation of movements of different 
characters in the arm area. (After Horsley.) 
to find that the cortical representations of different 
muscle groups is not at all dependent on their mass, but 
is related rather to refinement and complexity of the 
movements which these muscles effect. Accordingly 
the massive muscles of the trunk and leg are but poorly 
represented, while, on the other hand, those of the face 
and arm have much larger areas devoted to them. And 
further, in the arm area it is to the thumb and index 
finger, in the head area to the tongue, lips, and muscles 
of phonation, to which the greatest extension is given. 
The exact adjustment of the refined movements repre-
-P-A-G-E-265
LOCALISATION OF FUNCTION. 265 
sented by these groups of muscles demands many 
associations, and it is apparently as an anatomical 
device for furnishing such associations that their exten- 
sive representation is significant. Experimentally it is 
possible to partially innervate a muscle, throwing into 
contraction only a portion of its fibres, and in making 
delicate and finely adjusted voluntary contractions it is 
probably necessary to innervate the different groups of 
muscle fibres in varying proportions. The mechanism 
for the tongue may be taken as an illustration. To the 
tongue run many fibres from the spinal centres, and 
since there are many they must come from different 
portions of the motor nucleus. The tongue is moved 
whenever the appropriate area in the cortex is stimu- 
lated, but the contraction is slightly varied according to 
the portion of the area aroused, and under normal con- 
ditions the incoming impulse associated with one form 
of movement will act through one group of efferent cells, 
while another movement will depend on the discharge 
of a slightly different group, thus giving an anatomical 
basis for differences in the resultant contractions. 
It is to be noted in this connection that the move- 
ments of the body as a whole do not belong to the group 
requiring fine adjustment. 
As already stated, experiment shows that in man the 
special cortical centres are somewhat separated from 
one another, and this separation is due to masses of 
brain substance which do not give reactions upon ordi-- 
nary electrical stimulation. Further than this, the pro- 
portion of the brain which is thus latent, giving no 
reaction upon stimulation, seems to be larger in man 
than in the monkey. Certain differences between man 
and the macaque monkey in the development of the 
cortical centres can be explained by the fact that the 
macaque monkey makes a greater voluntary use of its 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
  266 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
legs in climbing. In man this control is not exercised, 
and therefore there is no corresponding development, 
yet it is by no means easy to say what the increase in 
the latent areas may signify. From what is known of 
the human brain it is justifiable to. consider this pecu- 
liarity as a mark of superiority. It appears, therefore, 
that the development of the human cortex is not, as 
might perhaps have been anticipated from the study of 
the lower mammals, dependent onan increasing localisa- 
tion, whereby larger and larger portions of the cortex 
-were given over to the efferent control of the different 
groups of muscles, but to a limitation of the areas from 
which the efferent impulse can be aroused. Possibly 
the failure to obtain a response from so much of the 
human cortex is related to the larger development of 
the central elements having an associative function, 
about the several groups of efferent elements, the 
artificial stimulus being therefore applied to but a 
fraction of the central elements usually concerned 
in the discharge of the efferent group. This view 
has been recently expressed by Flechsig.t More- 
over, a distinction can fairly be made between mus- 
cular reactions like those of facial expression, which are 
in themselves highly variable, and the habitual move- 
ments of the leg which, though not so variable in itself, 
may yet occur in almost any combination with other 
movements. It is hardly to be expected that the 
cortical arrangement would in these two cases be similar. 
Thus far attention has been directed to the efferent 
cortical discharge which would occur in consequence of 
incoming impulses directly arriving in the immediate 
neighbourhood of the efferent cells. At the same time, 
it is recognised that impressions received through the 
ear can influence, let us say, the movements of the

leg, and it is therefore argued that there must be con- 
nections between these widely separated areas. It 
would appear that this connection depends upon path- 
ways of association furnished by central cells, and along 
which the disturbance set up in the auditory area is 
communicated to the leg area. The relation here cited 
is but one of many combinations which can occur, and 
we have to conceive the incoming disturbances as dis- 
tributing itself in many directions, although the response

to it may be limited. Some of the larger pathways 
which probably furnish such connection are shown in 
Fig. 58. 
In the cortex, therefore, as in the case of the spinal 
cord, a sensory impulse arriving at one of these given 
points, may diffuse itself in many directions, and indeed

must do so, if it is to bring several motor centres under 
its influence. The sensory impulse reaching the cortical 
cells may thus be compared to a complex sound wave 
striking upon resonators, each one of which picks out 
that vibration to which it has been attuned and responds 
to it. Moreover, to push the simile further, the pitch 
of responsive cells may be altered by the play of other 
impulses upon them, and thus the analysis at different 
times is not the same. Refinement in the structure of 
the cerebral cortex may, therefore, be developed in three 
ways: first, by the multiplication of the pathways bear- 
ing the incoming impulses ; second, by rendering more 
sensitive to slight differences in the stimulation those 
cells whose function it is to receive these impulses ; and 
third, by increasing the number of the central cells. So 
far as can be seen at present, the brains of the lower 
and less intelligent mammals are inferior in all these 
respects, but are most deficient on the side of the 
afferent and central elements. 
Besides the prime duty of furnishing pathways for 
the incoming impulses destined to arouse sensations, 
the afferent elements take part in other changes 
which are of great importance. On them primarily 
depends the full and final development of the cortex, 
for, to some extent, the very growth of the hemispheres 
hangs on the manner in which they are excited, 
healthy activity promoting fuller development. It is 
not necessary to go into details which favour such a 
view ; but much evidence can be obtained from cases 
in which the course of development has been more or 
less modified, as the result of interference with the 
incoming impulses. 
As might be supposed, the pathways connecting the 
efferent cells in the cortex with the lower centres in the 
central axis, are proportionately more numerous in man
-P-A-G-E-269

than in any other animal, when we measure them by 
means of the area which they occupy in cross-sections 
of the bulb or cord, for since the fibres are in the 
several cases approximately of the same diameter the 
area of the bundle corresponds to the number of fibres 
which it contains. The relations are shown in the 
accompanying figure. 
These anatomical relations are inadequate to fully 
measure the physiological differences, for man surpasses 
the dog in the adjustment of his limbs to a greater 
degree than is here indicated, because the total

complexity of the igalaus 4 must be expressed by the 
increased complexity of all the structural elements in- 
volved in producing it, and not that of any one alone. 
Since the fibres of the pyramidal tract take origin in 
the efferent elements of the cortex, the greater the 
extent of the area the more abundant should be the 
fibres coming from it. Thus it is evident. that the 
bundle of fibres coming from the large cortical area for 
the arm should have a greater cross-section than that

the internal capsule. Their position in the capsule, both 
with relation to the rest of the brain and to one another, 
is highly constant, and there is here found a degree of 
localisation which is just as exact as that in the cortex 
itself. This arrangement is shown in Fig. 61. 
It has been seen that the larger number of incoming 
fibres cross the middle line at the lower end of the bulb 
and enter the opposite hemisphere. In a like manner, 
the fibres arising from this hemisphere and carrying the 
outgoing impulses cross with one another at nearly the 
same level, and so innervate the nuclei controlling the 
muscles of the opposite half of the body. 
Just as experiments have shown in the case of the 
so-called motor areas, that removal of the cortex is 
accompanied by disturbances of the dermal sensations, 
so in the sensory areas removal of the cortex affects one 
or the other of the sense organs named. By this method, 
combined with pathological observations, we learn that 
the sense of smell is probably associated with the mesal 
surface of the temporal lobe, the sense of hearing with 
the first and second temporal gyri in the middle part of 
their course, and the sense of sight with the occipital 
lobe, and especially with that portion of it called the 
cuneus. The paths by which the stimuli arriving along 
these different lines may reach and affect any of the 
efferent cells elsewhere located in the cortex, are pro- 
bably found in the great systems of association and 
commissural fibres, already described. 
Any sensation can serve to arouse any group of motor 
centres which are under voluntary control. At the 
same time certain groups of incoming impulses are 
usually accompanied by corresponding reactions, or in 
other words, that there are preferred pathways between 
the incoming fibres and discharging cells representing 
those muscular adjustments which are easiest.
-P-A-G-E-273
  LOCALISATION OF FUNCTION. 273 
Some movements like those for the eyes are repre- 
sented by more than one point in the cortex, from which 
they may be aroused by direct stimulation. It appears 
that the movements of the eyes, which follow stimulation 
of the frontal region, are due to impulses, which, arising 
there, pass to the lower centres, from which arise the 
motor nerves controlling the muscles of the eyes; and in 
the same way movements: af the eyes, which follow 
stimulation of the occipital region, depend on impulses 
which pass directly from the point of stimulation to the 
lower centres. It has been suggested that when the 
sensory area in the occipital region was stimulated, and 
movements of the eyes followed, they were due to im- 
pulses which passed’ from the occipital to the frontal 
region by-way of the association fibres, and then through 
the mediation ofthe frontal centres found their way to 
the lower centres. But Schafer showed that in the 
monkey’s brain the two cortical! regions might be com- 
pletely separated from one another, and yet the reaction 
followed stimulation of the occipital cortex, thus proving 
that they were not connected. At the same time, the 
movements of the leg, for example, can be modified by 
impressions received through the eyes, and in this case 
the muscles are in part controlled by a sense organ 
with which they are not associated at the periphery, and 
whose cortical area is remote from that of the efferent 
fibres. In the reactions of which this is a type, as when 
one steps back before a wave of water, the reaction is 
probably mediated by association fibres between the 
sensory, visual, and motor, leg areas.. This is very im- 
portant as a fundamental arrangement, because, while 
the primary condition puts each group of muscles into 
relations with the sense organ with which it has the 
most immediate peripheral associations, this second

arrangement renders it possible for every sense organ 
to control the ‘centre for each group of muscles, in so 
far as it is connected with it by paths of associating 
fibres, and renders possible even the cross associations 
between the different sensory areas, which are indicated 
by coloured hearing and the like. 
Although anatomically the evidence is good that the 
nerve tracts which put one hemisphere in connection 
with one half of the spinal cord, cross the middle line at 
the lower end of the bulb, yet physiological experiments, 
in which one hemisphere of the cerebrum has been re- 
moved from a dog, show that both halves of the body 
may come under the voluntary control of the remaining 
half of the cerebrum. This relation is not readily 
explained. One difficulty resides in the fact that we 
can by no means be sure that the manner in which the 
impulses pass in the system after the operation is the 
only one by which they pass under normal conditions, 
for the central system gives evidence of possessing 
supplementary pathways. Keeping this in mind, it 
appears that the pathway by which one hemisphere can 
control both halves of the body is dependent on a cross 
connection between the appropriate lower centres in the 
spinal cord. This cross connection is such in those cases 
in which the muscles act in unison, as in the muscles of 
mastication or phonation, that injury to one hemisphere 
causes but little disturbance in the performance of these 
muscles, the voluntary control of the centres on both 
sides being easily maintained from either cerebral hemi- 
sphere. On the other hand, where symmetrical groups 
of muscles do not customarily react together, the control 
of them by one hemisphere is but slowly attained, even 
in the dog, 
It would appear to be most easily accomplished in 
young and_ half-grown animals—a fact which can be

interpreted to.mean either that before maturity there 
exist pathways which later cease to be permeable, or, the 
lesion occurring before maturity, that under the new and 
abnormal condition fresh connections are established by 
compensatory growth, the capacity for which growth is 
later lost. In man, of course, the ‘paralysis of a limb 
caused by injury to the adult cortex is permanent, and 
there is no suggestion that the other hemisphere acquires 
a subsequent ‘control of both halves of the cord, but a 
similar lesion may be far less damaging when it occurs 
in a child. : 
This leads to the question of the relative importance 
of the two cerebral hemispheres in man. It is probable, 
from all that can be ascertained, that in a thoroughly 
ambidextrous individual the two hemispheres more 
nearly correspond in their functions than they doin the 
one-handed individuals, as represented by the majority 
of the community. [tis certain, however, that while in 
the strongly right-handed persons it is the left hemi- 
sphere which is mainly concerned, the reverse is the 
case in those left-handed. For example, in the average 
right-handed person the entire series of disturbances 
which are grouped under the term aphasia, occur as the 
result of injuries to the left hemisphere. Seeking to 
explain’ this, We recognise that the sense organs con- 
nected with injured hemispheres are most naturally asso- 
ciated with the motor centres of the same side ; but even 
if this is granted, the manner in which this peculiarity 
was acquired, and the duties of the other hemisphere, 
remain still unexplained. Though in children injury to 
one hemisphere may be compensated by the develop- 
ment of the other, in the adult such is not the case. 
Normally, too, the hemispheres attain nearly the same 
weight, and there is no evidence that the left hemi- 
sphere is persistently the heavier in a right-handed ~

person. The reasons for these relations are, therefore, 
not evident in the present way of regarding the 
nervous system, according to which growth and in- 
crease in size are associated with activity. The 
anatomical arrangement, which was originally respon- 
sible for this one-sidedness, has still to be investi- 
gated, in order to determine whether the better 
development of the afferent or efferent structures control 
the matter in the first instance, and to discover, if pos- 
sible, how far the physiological processes in the neglected 
hemisphere may be duplicates of those in the one pre- 
ferred. At the moment, however, it is not possible to 
do more than state the difficulty. Yet it is possible that 
since the relations between the outgrowths of one cell 
element and those of another must be both very exact and 
very close, a cessation of the growth processes just this 
side of the best degree of approximation between the 
two would produce a defect in organisation, not accom- 
panied by differences in weight, since they might 
easily be masked, in the sense that a slightly better 
development of myeline might occur on the neglected 
side. Such questions as are suggested by aphasia, the 
analysis of which has contributed so much to our know- 
ledge of brain processes, can be discussed more con- 
veniently in the chapter on education, and will be there 
treated after the activity, fatigue, and old age of the 
central system have been reviewed.

THE nerve element is a source of energy. Composing 
the nerve cell are substances in chemical equilibrium so 
unstable that. stimuli easily excite them to further 
change. As a consequence they assume a more stable 
chemical form, and at the same time part with some of 
their energy. Various similes have been used to illus- 
trate this event. The irritable cell is often pictured as 
a powder magazine to which a small spark, the stimulus, 
may be applied, with the result of causing an explosion 
that liberates a quantity of force many times greater 
than that represented by the spark. The powder 
magazine, however, explodes with the same force 
whether it be ignited by a match or by a torch, and in 
such a case, therefore, no proportion obtains between 
the magnitude of the stimulus and the magnitude of the 
explosion;—For this reason the simile does not fully 
express the facts, since in the nerve cell the larger 
stimulus is followed by the larger explosion. A truer 
picture may be obtained by comparing these events 
with the result of rolling a ball against a group of pins. 
i
-P-A-G-E-278
278 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
In this case the resulting breakdown depends in part upon 
the force developed by the falling pins, but the amount 
of this is in turn dependent on the force with which 
the ball—corresponding to the initial stimulus—strikes 
them. The actual disproportion which exists between 
the stimulus and the reaction is less emphasised by this 
illustration than by that of the powder magazine, but it 
possesses the advantage of indicating how the energy of 
the final disturbance depends in part on that of the 
stimulus. In view of this relation the possible variations 
in the strength of the impulse which may cause these 
changes become important. 
The change set up in the nerve by exciting it is 
designated the nerve impulse. Of its intimate nature 
nothing is known. The impulse has been investigated, 
however, by the aid of the electrical changes in the 
nerve which accompany it like a shadow, and make the 
study of it possible. All portions of the nervous 
system are irritable, which is equivalent to saying that 
the stimulation of any portion can give rise to nerve 
impulses; and it has been further found that when 
artificially aroused in nerve fibres the impulses travel in 
both directions from the point of stimulation. — 
Attention is here claimed for the important fact that 
the nerve impulse is normally not aroused in the cell- 
body, but at the ends of the cell outgrowths, so that 
however much these outgrowths differ from the cell 
giving origin to them, irritability and the capacity for 
transmitting the nerve impulse must be granted to 
them. There can be little doubt that in a given nerve 
element the impulses have a predominant direction, but 
this arrangement does not exclude the possibility of 
other impulses whose direction is the reverse (see 
Fig. -62). 
Directly bearing on this suggestion are some ex-

periments by Gotch and Horsley, which show that the 
nerve impulses may pass out of the spinal cord by way 
of the dorsal roots, although usually they are pictured 
only as passing in.t On the other hand, these observers 
found that if a ventral root were stimulated the nervous 
impulse could not be detected as passing in any of the 
columns of the cord; apparently it was blocked in the 
cell-bodies of these ventral elements. This fact does 
not prove, however, that such an impulse is without 
influence in modifying both the reactions and the 
nutrition of the cell-body in which it seems to disappear. 
These beautiful researches of Gotch and Horsley have 
shown that the strength of a nerve impulse as measured 
in the columns of the spinal cord is much diminished 
when it emerges through a ventral root. There may be 
several causes for this, but the fact of interest is the 
smallness of the electrical disturbance accompanying 
the nerve impulse under these conditions. 
The electrical variation passes along the nerve in the 
form of a wave, so that a simultaneous disturbance 
may be detected extending over a piece of nerve some 
18 mm. long, the crest of the wave being somewhat in 
advance. The rate at which this wave travels has been 
often studied, but without concordant results. The 
determination of this rate in a frog’s nerve was one of 
the early triumphs of von Helmholtz, who found it to 
be about 30 meters per second. In warm-blooded 
animals the best observations indicate a rate of about 40 
meters per second. Reducing these to expressions with 
which we are more familiar, these rates are represented 
by that of a railroad train running -at 68-90 miles an 
hour, or a horse going at the rate of one mile in 40-54 
seconds. These figures should be applied with caution, 
since they are the averages of widely divergent single 
* Gotch and Horsley, Proc. Roy. Soc., London, 1888.  
-P-A-G-E-281
  PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE CENTRAL SYSTEM. 281 
observations, the cause of this divergence being still 
undetermined. It has been suggested that the rate was 
not the same in the different portions of the nervous 
system, but this suggestion is without evidence, though 
there is reason to think that in passing through the cell- 
body, or in passing from one cell element to another, 
the impulse is much delayed. The signs of metabolism 
following activity in the nerve fibres are so slight that 
they have not yet been clearly demonstrated, therefore 
it is possible to assume that either there are metabolic 
changes which have not yet been detected, or that the 
nerve impulse is not accompanied by such changes. 
However this question shall be decided for the fibres, 
there is the plainest evidence for metabolic changes in 
the bodies of the nerve cells, but the description of 
these will be reserved for the chapter on fatigue. If 
the nerve impulses are normally initiated at the tips 
of the cell branches, metabolic changes which have not 
yet been discovered are to be expected at these points. 
- To arouse a nerve impulse several conditions must 
be fulfilled. First a sudden stimulus must be applied. 
For example, the rapidly interrupted electrical current 
stimulates, whereas a slow variation in the intensity of 
this same current does not. Or, again, when mechanical 
stimulation is employed a slow increase of pressure fails 
to elicit a response, whereas a light tapping will"lo so. 
Gradual changes, therefore, do not act as_ stimuli. 
This, however, is by no means equivalent to the state- 
ment that they are without effect, although concerning 
the effect of such inefficient stimuli nothing is known. 
It has been also shown that the determination of a 
reaction is more dependent on the rate at which the 
stimuli occur than upon their strength, and that a single 
stimulus does not elicit a response. It appears, in con- 
sequence, that the arrangements in the central nervous
-P-A-G-E-282

system are such that it reacts more perfectly to a series 
of slight stimuli than to a small number of strong 
ones. When in an afferent nerve an impulse is aroused 
under these conditions it passes on to a cell-body, and 
there initiates changes which, though in the main 
similar in different cells, have probably local peculiarities 
according to the elements involved. These changes 
cause a second set of impulses, which may leave the

cell-body with a rate and force quite different from the 
first. The rapidity with which the impulses follow one 
another has been recently studied with success. When 
during an epileptic attack of cortical origin the muscles 
of a limb are thrown into contraction, they are first held 
in a tonic spasm, which in turn gives way to a clonic 
series. The record of the muscular contractions during 
such an attack would be similar to that expressed by 
the accompanying curve (I), Fig. 63. The curve (II),

PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE CENTRAL SYSTEM. 283 
however, is the record of the manner in which the nerve 
impulses followed one another along the spinal cord as 
the result of stimulating the cerebral cortex, and curve 
III the record of the stimulus. Since the results occur 
when the cortical cells alone are stimulated, it is 
inferred that the peculiar character of the contractions 
during the epileptic attack depends upon the manner in 
which the cortical cells discharge. Looking more 
closely at this reaction, it appears that the discharge 
begins almost.as soon as the stimulus is applied to the 
cortex, but it may nevertheless go on for some time 
after it has been withdrawn. The discharge, therefore, 
takes more time than that occupied by the application 
of the stimulus; moreover, it is not continuous, but 
rhythmical. 
On anatomical grounds the nerve cells are considered 
separate units, between which not only is there no 
genetic continuity, but as a rule not even a secondary 
connection as close as that between the nerve and 
muscle elements. For this reason it is difficult, strictly 
speaking, to trace the pathway of a nerve impulse, 
since now and again there is a gap in its course. Asa 
matter of fact the impulses cross this gap, though the 
manner of crossing is still unknown. This difficulty has 
been mentioned in an earlier chapter, and is again 
stated, since at this point it plays an important part. 
The cell outgrowths are the channels along which the 
waves of nerve impulse are guided in their passage 
through the central system. Repeated incoming impulses 
produce such changes in ‘the cell-bodies that finally 
some of them discharge with a force and rhythm of their 
own, and once taken up by the central cells, even slight 
stimuli diffuse themselves over the entire central system, 
although, in any given case, the reactions which we anti- 
cipate and record may come from only a limited portion 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  284 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
of it. In thus picturing the entire nervous system as a 
sensitive mechanism, it is evident that it must respond 
to the surrounding stimuli as does the water of a lake 
to the breeze; and. such is the relation between the 
central system and its environment that the breeze is 
always blowing and the waves of change always chasing 
one another among the responsive elements. If there 
are no waves then the cells are dead. The breeze still 
blows, but it falls on a frozen surface, on cells chilled 
and rigid beyond the power of response. 
The ceaselessness of this stimulation cannot be pre- 
sented too strongly, because those stimuli which do not 
come clearly into consciousness are but too readily neg- 
lected. Yet the responses of this ever sensitive system 
reacting to never-ending stimuliare by no means always 
part of our conscious life, and hence these changes must 
be indirectly studied if they are to be recognised at all. 
That such variations may be due either to changes in 
the exciting stimuli, or to different degrees of respon- 
siveness on the part of the central system, is self-evident. 
The stimuli during the day are many and strong, but 
few and weak at night, different according to the seasons 
of the year, and dependent on changes both without and 
within the body, changes involving not only alterations 
in those forms of energy for which special sense organs 
exist, and which produce the sensations of light, sound, 
taste, odour, and touch, but also in those for which there 
are no such organs, as humidity, electric tension, atmo- 
spheric pressure, and the like. Yet to all these stimuli 
responses are made, and they are never twice the same. 
The changes in the organism as a whole, for the most 
part unrecognised, are well illustrated by the variations 
in the capacity for the performance of voluntary mus- 
cular work. It has been found by Lombard? that this

power was decteased by a decrease in the atmospheric 
pressure, while in summer, several days of high tem- 
perature, especially with great humidity, were followed 
by a distinct loss. The variation. in the capacity for 
muscular work is mainly due to changes in the nervous 
system, and hence may be taken as an example of the 
susceptibility of this system to influences for which we 
possess no special organ of sense. Such general stimuli 
as have just been mentioned, humidity and pressure, 
affect all parts of the central system at the same time, 
yet the power of causing a general effect is common to 
all stimuli, be they never so localised at their origin. 
On the wide diffusion of impulses depends the fact 
that a slight stimulation of one part of the system is 
favourable to the reaction following the stimulation of 
another. Indeed a condition of diffused stimulation is 
an essential of the waking state, and if it is not for- 
gotten that stimuli which when of low intensity can 
thus reinforce one another, may become antagonistic 
when their intensity is raised, no confusion need be 
introduced by the observations to be cited later. This 
reinforcing influence of two stimuli can be illustrated 
by the studies which have been made on the knee- 
kick. 
If the thigh be supported, so that the leg can swing 
freely, and the tendon below the knee-pan be sharply 
struck, the leg will be kicked out. This reaction is 
brought about by the contraction of extensor muscles 
in the thigh, and requires for its normal occurrence both 
the nervous connections of these muscles with the cord, 
and also a healthy condition of the cord. The study of 
the normal knee-kick has shown that it differs widely in 
different persons ; that in the same person it varies from 
day to day ; that during sleep it may disappear, while in 
the waking state it may show not only rhythmic varia-

tions, but a vast number of irregularities, some of which 
can be explained. 
For example, let the subject gradually fall asleep, the 
knee-kicks become less and less extensive, as can be 
seen by the accompanying graphic record; then sud- 
denly it becomes vigorous again.t 
This revival may be caused by any sort of stimulus—

in the lumbar region of the cord. Yet the various 
stimuli which have been enumerated have their points 
of entrance into the central system not only at different 
localities, but at those far removed from the lumbar 
region; nevertheless in every case reactions due to 
impulses leaving the cord in this region are affected. 
The diffusion of the incoming impulse is beautifully 
shown by the studies on the quantity of blood in a limb 
during sleep (Bardeen and Nichols). 
These experiments were made as follows :—The arm 
was encased in a plethysmograph, a glass cylinder filled 
with water, and so arranged that the quantity of water 
within it varied as the limb swelled or shrank. These 
variations in the volume of the arm were recorded as 
given in Figs. 66,67. During sleep the arm normally 
swelled. The curves begin at the left, the arm being in 
a swollen condition. When the sleeper was disturbed 
by a sound, though he was not awakened, yet the 
nervous system was aroused sufficiently to give a 
vigorous response, and the volume of the arm diminished 
by the withdrawal of blood. This is indicated by the 
depression of the curve. The value of these experiments 
for the present discussion lies in the fact that they are 
typical, and there is warrant for assuming that, if other 
forms of stimuli were taken and their effects measured 
by still other reactions, there would be found the same 
indication of diffusion. The consideration of these facts 
is important, especially by reason of the apparent oppo- 
sition in which they stand to the doctrine of localisation, 
with which they cannot fail to be contrasted. By way 
of harmonising them, it should be remembered that the 
facts of localisation are best demonstrated by the reac- 
tions of efferent cells, whereas the phenomena of diffusion 
pertain to the afferent and central elements. They are 
two opposite aspects detectable in all complete reactions,

and must be regarded rather as mutually influencing 
than as excluding one another. Such being the case 
in respect to the diffusion of impulses, it becomes 
important to examine the physiological status thus 
created by all those impulses entering the central system

but the condition of the nervous system on which these 
stimuli play is ever changing and never capable of any 
but the most general expression ; hence the difficulty of 
predicting the reactions of the organism as a whole. It 
is possible, however, to study some of the general 
changes which occur in this background, and it was 
as a foundation for this study that the observations 
bearing on the diffusion of the nerve impulse have been 
introduced. 
Granting that the central system responds throughout 
a large extent to all the impulses acting upon it, and 
that by virtue of these responses the background varies, 
it remains to be determined how far the law and order 
in these changes can be formulated. There are some 
observations on the reinforcement of the knee-kick* 
which are important in this place. In these experiments 
it was found that, if a voluntary contraction of the hand 
was made by the subject about the time that his tendon 
was tapped, the extent of the knee-kick was thereby 
influenced. The modification thus introduced by the 
additional activity had the effect of increasing or 
decreasing the height of the kick according to the time 
relations of the two events. The following diagram 
expresses the results of varying this relation (Fig. 68). 
This curve is typical, and although there is some 
variation in the reaction according to the nature of the 
stimulus and the peculiarities of the subject, yet in 
general the cord reacts more vigorously just after the 
reinforcement. 
The reactions obtainable by the application of a given 
stimulus depend on the other stimuli with which the 
new one is competing. Cold water does not feel cold 
after ice; a black line on a grey surface has a value

different from the same line on a white one, and so on 
throughout all contrasts. 
This relation between the stimulus and the sensation 
is expressed in the psycho-physic law by the formula 
that sensation increases in intensity according to the 
logarithm of the stimulus. The limits within which this 
law is applicable do not immediately concern us, its use 
here being merely to express the fact that at any moment

may or may not be recognised. Pierce and Jastrow * 
have reported observations bearing on just this matter. 
Briefly these interesting experiments were as follows :— 
Two illuminated surfaces were compared when the in- 
tensity of the illumination differed by a very slight yet 
measurable amount, the subject being required to state 
which surface was the brighter. ‘The difference was so 
slight that it could not be recognised, and the subject 
was therefore compelled to “guess.” The result of 
“guessing” showed that the brighter was correctly 
designated with a frequency so great that the unre- 
cognised difference was clearly effective in determining 
the choice. The observations have shown that differ- 
ences too small to be discriminated may still influence 
our reactions, and it is thus seen that among effective 
stimuli there must also be included those which we do 
not recognise.

PHYSIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS. 
Dependence of the central system—Distribution of blood—Physio- 
logical rhythms—The greater cycles—Rhythms of the species 
and the individual—Long rhythms—Daily rhythms—Artificial 
rhythms—Variations in muscular power—-Minor rhythms— 
Pathological variations in reaction—Automaticity. 
Up to this point the nervous system, and the changes 
which occur in it, have been treated as though isolated 
and independent, and no effort has been made to 
emphasise the position of this system as one of several 
mutually dependent upon each other for their common 
existence. Nevertheless, the brain and cord are at the 
mercy of the circulating blood, and through the distribu- 
tion and quality of the latter the vigour and speed of 
their reactions are entirely controlled. The central 
system thus stands in the relation of an engine to its fuel 
and furnace. The engine may be never so fine, but if 
the motive power is not sufficient it will work poorly or 
not at all. So in the animal body, let there be an im- 
perfection in the working of the heart, rigidity or 
flabbiness in the vessels, a delinquent gland disturbing 
the nutritive conditions under which the nerves act, 
and at once the entire system is affected. These facts 
have a very direct bearing. When, for example, it is a 
question of inferring the mental abilities of an individual 
from the gross anatomy of his brain, it must always be 
293
-P-A-G-E-294
  294 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
remembered that nutrition has been left out of account. 
In any given case, the abundance of the blood supply 
to the encephalon can be expressed only in a vague 
way, as an inference from the size of the heart and blood 
vessels. Taking such facts into consideration, it becomes 
intelligible that there should be within us a vast number 
of nutritive variations, and that between the states of 
“well” and “ill,” which are clearly appreciated, there is 
a long series of undefined conditions. Many of these 
changes, dependent both on the influences from without 
and within the organism, are subject to rhythmic 
variations. 
Of the external stimuli, those of light, sound, and 
temperature undergo a rhythmic change in intensity 
corresponding to the alternation of day and night, and 
such changes are still more clearly marked in the nutri- 
tive variations to which the central system is subjected. 
These physiological rhythms are habits of organic 
activity which have been found advantageous, and 
which in man are highly developed. As _ habits, they 
are open to modification, but owing to their fundamental 
character they probably change only with great slowness. 
All the lesser cycles of the individual are encompassed 
by the one great period of growth, beginning with the 
fertilisation of the ovum and ending with somatic disso- 
lution. Inevitable and rooted in the constitution of 
the organism, this places the termini between which 
the other changes fall. Yet there is, perhaps, a cycle 
beyond this if, taking man collectively, we attempt a 
wider view, and put the species in the place of the 
individual. Thus it is not to be forgotten that to 
anticipate a termination of our species on the earth 
is but: looking forward, as we look backward to its 
earliest appearance, and within the limits of this 
greatest period must lie the record of humanity.  
-P-A-G-E-295
  PHYSIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS. 295 
History shows that races rise, flourish, and disappear, 
as do the special civilisations that may spring up among 
them, and it is probable that all the phenomena of 
development are as surely to be detected in the 
species as in the individual and his constituent cells. 
Of late, it has been recognised that the living sub- 
stance composing the higher organisms may be divided 
into two portions, the body, or soma, and the germ-plasm, 
or reproductive cells. In the developing animal certain 
cells are early set aside to form the reproductive elements, 
and about these the remaining cells build up a protect- 
ing body. The great mass of elements which form the 
soma is, therefore, contrasted with the much smaller mass 
that forms the germ-plasm, and these subdivisions of 
the individual have quite different histories. The germ- 
plasm giving rise through successive generations to new 
individuals wears the appearance of immortality, while 
the soma, which shrinks and breaks down after its 
traditional cycle of “threescore years and ten,” has no 
such claim to distinction. Dependent on slow changes 
wrought in the germ-plasm must be the long growth 
period of races and nations to which allusion has just 
been made, but the rhythms here to be discussed are those 
occurring within the time limits of somatic life. An 
analysis of the growth-period shows that in the process 
of increase in size, phases of rest alternate with those of 
activity. This rhythm is most rapid at the beginning 
of development, and probably the vigorous growth at 
puberty is but the last well-marked acceleration, after 
the completion of which increase becomes slow, then 
ceases, and finally gives way to the changes characteristic 
of old age. Within the life-cycle comes that of repro- 
ductive capability, with its beginning at adolescence, its 
maximum at the completion of somatic growth, followed 
by a slow decline, leading to cessation in old age.

  296 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
In the temperate latitudes man is subject to the cycle of 
the year. This is shown by growth and change in body- 
weight in the young, and in the mature by alterations in 
nutrition. But it is in the estivating and hyberna- 
ting animals that there is probably to be seen the full 
development of those changes dependent on the return- 
ing seasons—changes which are only suggested in 
ourselves. Down? has observed that in England idiots 
lose in winter the few acquisitions which they have 
been able to make during the summer, when there is 
least tax on their poorly nourished bodies. These 
seasonal variations, with their long rhythms in nutrition 
and heat regulation of the body, are again broken into 
monthly periods. Most marked of these is the menstrual 
period in the female, with its numerous concomitant 
changes.2 In the males, also, there is perhaps a trace 
of this lunar cycle,3 while under pathological conditions 
appear a whole series of periodic phenomena, insanities, 
and the like, impulses to “ spree” and “bad days,” which 
also seem to have a common basis in such a monthly 
rhythm. 
The weekly: period is only slightly marked and not 
organically established. When, however, the daily cycle 
is examined, many important rhythms become evident, 
some of which are organically based, but many of them 
quite dependent on varying social customs. 
With the alternations of daylight. and darkness there 
has developed the corresponding alternation of activity 
and repose. In normal individuals under the most natural 
conditions this amounts to an organic habit, and where 
such a habit has been well established, it is only to be 
slowly broken. On the other hand, variations in external

  PHYSIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS. 297 
conditions play a large vé/e, and the long summer days 
as well as the long winter nights of the high north tend 
to prolonged activity followed by prolonged rest. Some 
happily constructed individuals can sleep for short . 
periods, and thus refreshed take up their work, being 
fortunately independent of the place or hour. We 
recognise this capacity as especially developed in the 
animals whose principal sense is that of smell or hearing, 
and to whom sleep is an ever-present resource, quite 
independent of the time of day; while the birds domi- 
nated by vision are more strictly controlled by light, 
and, with the exception of the nocturnal or crepuscular 
species, in which the conditions are reversed, have their 
repose determined by the darkness. Yet even in birds 
during periods of excitement, as when breeding or 
migrating, the influence of surrounding conditions may 
be defied. On the other hand, birds mistake the dark- 
ness of an eclipse for the evening, and return to roost. 
Thus, among different groups of animals are to be 
found the same wide variations in the rhythm of rest 
and activity as among men; at the same time the fact 
is not without interest that the animals depending mainly 
on the intermittent olfactory stimuli exhibit less marked 
daily rhythm than do those controlled by the visual 
stimuli that so perfectly dominate the birds. 
Like all rhythms, those of the nervous system demand 
for their production variations in the stimuli or in the 
condition of the system itself, or both. The least serious 
changes are those caused by modifying the incoming 
stimuli, whereas modifications of the physiological con- 
dition of the nerve centres are more fundamental. 
Normally, changes of the latter sort are brought about 
by variations of the blood supply due to organic reflexes, 
but to effect them drugs also are often used. It makes no 
difference whether excitants or depressants are employed,

have an unequal action, and are highly selective as to 
‘the system which they affect. Thus a physiological re- 
action which, to,.be normal, demands a subdivision of 
labour, is assigned in too large measure to one system, 
which, being unsupported by its neighbours, ultimately 
suffers harm. 
To return now to the question of daily rhythms in the 
healthy adult. From morning to evening stature varies; 
in the morning the stature may be I cm. greater than at 
night. Perhaps the inability to hold one’s self erect 
has something to do with this, or it may be the result of 
the general shrinkage of the intervertebral cartilages, for 
it is in the sitting height that the chief loss occurs. 
During the day the body-weight increases, the curve 
being the resultant of several factors, the ingestion of 
food and the processes of excretion. Along with this 
goes a regular rhythm in the bodily temperature, as 
shown in the curve below. 
This curve is fairly well established, but like so many 
of the other rhythms, it is partly the outcome of the 
habit of work, and three meals during the day, followed 
by rest and fasting at night for observation, indicates 
that those who work at night and rest during the day 
have this rhythm reversed. 
Several observers have noted a curious periodicity 
in the capability for muscular work. In one series 
of experiments the results were the following :—On 
repeatedly raising a weight by the flexion of a 
finger, it was found that as the finger tired the weight 
was raised through a smaller and smaller distance, 
until finally the muscles altogether failed to respond 
to the strongest voluntary impulse that could be 
brought to bear on them. If, despite this failure, the 
effort to raise the weight was regularly repeated, the 
contractions reappeared and finally resumed their wonted

power, so that the work done by a single contraction 
was almost as great as before the loss of power. 
The following curve represents several such periods, 
with the loss and return of power.! 
Since the periods do not occur upon direct stimula- 
tion of the muscle, the loss of power is probably due 
to changes in the nervous rather than the muscular 
system, and the loss was therefore taken as the first 
indication of central fatigue. By an automatic arrange- 
ment the work which was done in these experiments

was readily determined. When, therefore, it is stated 
that there is a regular variation in the capability for 
voluntary muscular work in the course of twenty-four 
hours, the measure used in making this determination 
is the amount of work accomplished between the begin- 
ning of a record and the first evidence of central fatigue, 
as shown by the failure to obtain a voluntary contrac- 
tion. In this way it was that Lombard determined the 
onset of fatigue at different hours of the day. 
It appears that this capability for work was lessened 
by general fatigue, hunger, declining atmospheric pres-

by practice, rest—especially sleep—food, increasing 
atmospheric pressure, and alcohol. In this we have an 
instance of the variations in the effectiveness with which 
voluntary impulses act on the centres in the spinal cord.

Recently Ostanikow and Gran have published some 
interesting figures concerning the diurnal variations of 
reaction times. When a stimulus is given, and in

response to it a movement is made, the time elapsing 
between the first and second event is the reaction time. 
The figures in Table 57 represent such times, and their 
diurnal variation is the feature to be illustrated. Of 
course, between the initial and final events various 
complicated processes may be intercalated. For 
example, the stimulus may be used as. the signal 
for a problem in mental arithmetic, or the association 
of simple ideas, at the conclusion of which the final 
reaction is to be made, and thus the total time of the 
reaction is modified by the speed with which this inter- 
mediate process is carried on.

From this it appears that under the conditions of the 
experiment, the reaction time, both simple and complex, 
tended to be longest in the afternoon and shortest in

either the morning or the early evening. The simple 
reaction times are shortest in the morning, whereas the 
others are shortest at the end of the day. 
The determination of a diurnal rhythm for purely 
intellectual work is complicated by the progressive 
fatigue of the nervous system as the day advances, and 
to a large extent by external conditions. It certainly 
depends on food supply, as all experiments indicate, yet 
digestion and brain work which call for the maximum 
blood supply at two different localities are not to be 
carried on simultaneously. It is difficult to get statistics 
bearing on the processes in question or to measure 
them ; for everything, from the orderly marshalling of 
the mental images in a logical line, to the patient 
waiting for isolated ideas to take shape, can be classed 
as intellectual work, and in the face of any statement 
which might now be made, there arise the shades of 
dead authors to affirm that it was far otherwise with 
them. For the present at least the problem must be 
left_as one too complicated for general expression. 
Of the shorter rhythms there are many. Asa rule 
there are three periods of digestion and absorption 
corresponding with the three meals, associated with 
changes in the circulation, heat production, muscular 
strength, and the emotional and mental activity, all of 
which are evident, even in spite of physiological arrange- 
ments, the assumed purpose of which is to maintain 
uniformity in these processes. There are, too, the long 
slow rhythms of blood pressure extending over many 
seconds, accompanied, perhaps, with corresponding varia- 
tions in the excitability of the central nervous system, 
while as smaller waves on this ground swell appear the 
oscillations due to the respiration and the heart beat, all

may be added those rhythmic variations which occur 
when we attempt to fix our attention steadily on one 
point, as well as those in the muscles of expression, 
variations which are recorded in everything from the 
rhetorical period to tremor. These, variations in the 
bodily condition are in general more marked in women 
than in men,t and the manner in which our entire 
existence is shot through with them is, in the light of 
the observations given above, amply evident. 
In view of this, the times and seasons for the tasks 
when the exercise of the nervous system is undertaken 
are worthy of careful study, for on the proper selection 
of them will depend in some measure the results. 
Jn popular estimation the organism is looked on as 
subject to but little change, while the surrounding con- 
ditions are made responsible for the differences in re- 
actions that are noted in different persons or in the same 
person at different times, yet as a matter of fact the 
variations in the organism play the more important ré/e. 
Though in health we are for the most part delightfully 
unconscious of these changes in ourselves, in abnormal 
conditions the consciousness of them can be greatly 
modified, and that too in either direction. A patient 
may be in bed for months with all the sensations of a 
broken leg, when there has been no break ; suffer from 
constipation, through neglect of the ordinary visceral 
sensations, which are somehow disregarded ;. or have for 
all practical purposes a paralysed arm which has grown 
out of the fear of pain, should the attempt be made to 
move it. Instances of this sort lie so close to every-day 
experience that a case may be quoted :?—“A lady 
about forty years of age, the wife of a physician, con- 
-sulted me in September, 1885, about her left shoulder ; 
* Vide Ellis, Wan and Woman, 1894. 
* Taylor, Journ. of Nerv. and Ment. Dis., 1888, 
 
-P-A-G-E-305
  PHYSIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS, 305 
she had wrenched it three months before while trying to 
save herself from falling on the stairs. She did fall and 
bruised herself in several places, but not on the shoulder. 
Her arm was afterwards stiff and painful, and she found 
it powerless at the shoulder and elbow ; she carried her 
arm in a sling, and it had been treated electrically. At 
the time of the examination there was pain in the elbow 
when she raised the arm more than 45 degrees from the 
side. When passive movements were made the muscles 
about the shoulder resisted, and motion was not free. 
Diagnosis of restraint and disturbed reflexes. Training 
of the reflexes by systematic movements was followed by 
marked improvement in mobility and usefulness of the 
arm, but after being treated for a week the patient was 
obliged to leave, and went home with the arm very - 
much disabled. It remained in about the same con- 
dition until the death of her husband, which occurred 
unexpectedly a few weeks later. The shock was so 
great that she became entirely unconscious of her arm, 
and from that it has been perfectly normal in every 
respect, as she was able to prove to me at her next visit.” 
In this instance by a twist of attention the patient 
became unduly conscious of processes in her spinal 
cord, which were, so to speak, none of her business, and 
it required another twist to free the spinal centres from 
the abnormal surveillance, and restore the functions of 
the muscles. 
Before leaving the subject in hand the perplexing 
question of automaticity in the nervous system must be 
touched upon. Examples of automaticity are the move- 
ments of an amceba, the pulsations in the umbrella of 
a jelly-fish, the beat of the heart, the rhythms of respira- 
tion or the purposeful movements of a higher animal. 
In these instances, with the exception of the amceba, 
we have the reactions under the control of a distinct 
20  
-P-A-G-E-306
    306 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
nervous system, and the question takes the form 
whether the nervous elements can discharge without 
being immediately excited by incoming stimuli. 
The test would be found in the reactions of these 
cells when deprived of all such stimuli. As a result 
of attempts to do this it is discovered that when the 
stimuli can really be removed the reactions cease, and 
that the nonconforming cases are those in which the 
stimuli cannot be controlled. As applied to the move- 
ments of the entire animal the view that automatic 
reactions are but a series of responses to stimuli more 
or less masked, may be illustrated in the following way: 
If a frog be deprived of its brain (encephalon), the cord 
being left intact, it will remain irritable for several days. 
Such a frog exhibits no automatic movements. It 
remains where it is placed. If the skin is stimulated, 
it reacts by a contraction of the appropriate muscles, 
and the reaction being completed, relapses into the 
quiescent state. The force and extent of the reaction in 
such a case is predictable since it depends in a large 
measure on the character of the stimulus. Let such 
a frog be compared with others in which successively 
smaller portions of the brain have been removed. As the 
quantity removed becomes less there is an increase in 
the number of the sense organs remaining intact, together 
with an increase of the total mass of nervous centres. 
The less the quantity removed the less predictable 
become the reactions of the frog, and the more difficult 
is the correlation between them and the stimulus, 
because for one thing there are greater variations in the 
excitability of the nerve centres themselves. But at 
best a normal frog is not a very complicated affair. It 
can safely be said that when pursued it will try to escape, 
though just how many jumps it will make and in what 
direction it will go are uncertain. If, passing up the
-P-A-G-E-307
  PHYSIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS, 307 
zoological scale, a bull-dog is irritated, the prediction 
is more difficult. He may try to escape or he may try 
something else ; yet whatever he does he will in most 
cases react shortly after the application of the stimulus. 
Stimulate a man and there are possible these forms of 
‘reaction with endless elaborations and modifications, but 
there is also a possible exaggeration of the time which 
may elapse between the application stimulus and the 
response. The interval may be only so long as is 
required to deal a blow, or the man may bequeath 
his response to an insult to his sons and establish a 
family feud. The capacity for postponing a reaction 
is the mark of the more highly developed animals, and 
especially of man. Often when a reaction takes place 
it seems to have no apparent relation to the stimuli 
acting at the moment: in one sense it does not have any, 
while in another it does. For this reason we have 
among the higher animals that remarkable discon- 
nection between the stimulus of the moment and the 
response to it, which gives the appearance of a mutual 
independence, and has thus given support to the con- 
ception of automatism in physiology. 
In the last analysis, however, the incoming stimuli 
appear as the causes of all our actions. The chain of 
events is often long and hard to follow ; but so much 
evidence stands on the side of the reflex nature of all 
actions, that the hypothesis of automatism is not longer 
necessary. 
The facts which have been reviewed show that in the 
nervous system there are changes continually going on, 
changes which are often rhythmic, and which, because 
they are easily diffused, affect the system as a whole, 
just as surely as the displacement of any member must 
affect the motions of a planetary group. Yet it is only 
here and there, or now and then, that this ceaseless flux

| 
rises into consciousness and reveals to us some notion of 
our own plasticity. | 
The rhythms which occur mark periods of greater 
alternating with those of less activity ; the former 
being those during which energy-producing substances 
break down, so that the organism is fatigued, and in 
this process of building up and breaking down is to be 
found the basis of those alterations in the nervous 
background which have been here presented. Fatigue 
is therefore worthy of careful examination, since a know- 
ledge of the processes causing it can on the one hand 
suggest why our capabilities periodically diminish, and 
on the other how this impressive change, the shadow of 
on-coming death, can be made least harmful.

Iv is conceivable that two individuals of equal age and 
size may have expended during their lives very different 
amounts of energy. Further, this expenditure need 
not in every case correspond with effective performance, 
for internal resistances may absorb a large share of the 
energy set free. That individuals differ in their every- 
day performances is recognised, and these inequalities 
depend both on a more happy organisation of those 
most capable, as well as on fundamental differences in 
the capacity for storing energy. Individual differences 
in these respects include the minutest details, and are 
remarkably persistent... For example, Mosso found that 
in the periodic loss of muscular power following pro- 
longed activity, the two individuals whom he specially

studied showed marked differences. Five years later 
another set of records showed the same differences. 
Similar illustrations might be indefinitely multiplied. 
At any moment the active body-cells contain a mass of 
substances capable of producing energy by their 
decomposition, yet the mass present at any moment 
is but a trifling fraction of that which will be built up 
and broken down in the course of a normal lifetime. 
This capacity to build up food-stuffs into its own 
substance is the peculiarity. of the living cell, as con- 
trasted with a crystal or a machine, and it is a question 
of great interest to learn whether in ourselves, by our 
own foresight, and within the limits of a lifetime, it can 
be increased. Thus it would be of importance could we 
determine whether the greater store of available energy 
in those who seek by hygienic care to cultivate their 
effective force is to be counted as an actual addition to 
their powers, or whether it is simply that fraction of 
inherited energy which has been rendered available by 
more effective expenditure. Probably both changes 
follow. Yet, so seldom are the natural forces normally 
expended, that it is difficult to get the data for a 
judgment. | 
In the body-form deviations from the mean are 
familiar, and their implication appreciated. The build 
of the “sprinter” is something quite different from that 
of the lifter of heavy weights. Or, taking deviations 
which are more marked, any part—head, arms, legs, 
chest—may be too large or too small for the other . 
portions of the body, and it is abundantly evident 
that these failures in proportion, if those of excess, may 
easily reach the point where the offending part becomes 
too large to be correctly nourished or controlled by the 
remainder of the body ; or, if those of defect, where the 
part must work under excessive strain, in order to con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-311

tribute its share to the total activities of the organism. 
Yet these anatomical variations have their physio- 
logical counterparts in every direction. A man con- 
demned by his profession to sedentary habits may find 
a splendid muscular system acting upon him as a 
veritable parasite, or conversely a bulky nervous system, 
coupled with too small a heart, may lead to an entire 
mental existence on half rations. In some small 
measure these maladjustments can be controlled, and 
by such control the effective activity increased. 
In the study of fatigue it is the changes in the 
material stored inthe active cells at any one time that 
claim attention. Normally exertion precedes fatigue. 
When the muscles are exercised with the purpose of 
increasing their strength, or the accuracy of their co- 
ordination, their reactions do not improve with regu- 
larity, or for an indefinite period. For the first two 
days or so of systematic exercise the reactions may be 
fairly satisfactory ; then follows a period of poor perfor- 
mance which, after due time, gives way to improvement 
that comes in waves. This indicates that the first 
general result of exercising the body-cells, and specially 
those of the central system, is not an immediate increase 
in their powers of metabolism, but that this power is 
only slowly improved. 
Even when cut off from their normal surroundings, 
as when a muscle or part of the spinal cord is isolated, 
the cells are for a time capable of doing work, but 
under such circumstances soon become exhausted. If 
the decrease in power under such circumstances is 
measured, it is found that .it steadily diminishes with 
each discharge. When a muscle tested in this way has 
» been brought to the point at which it will no longer 
respond, washing it out by passing a normal salt solu- 
tion through the vessels will cause a return of power.
-P-A-G-E-312
  312 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
Under natural conditions the blood is always streaming 
through the active tissue, and thus not only removing 
the waste products, but supplying fresh nutritive 
materials. In some measure the constructive and de- 
structive processes occur together, but the curve of 
normal fatigue indicates that the loss of power is first 
rapid and then slow, exhaustion being long deferred. 
The neuro-muscular reactions are under the control 
of the central system, and it is of interest to recall that, 
as shown in the last chapter, it is the variations in the 
nervous system which are most important for them. 
So, too, in the last stages of extreme fatigue, it is 
the nerve cells, not the muscles, which are exhausted. 
The exercise of cells finally causes both their better 
irrigation by the blood, and the greater and more rapid 
storage of fresh material. In this respect the structural 
element stands related to the nutrient lymph as does 
the entire arganism to its food supply ; a good appetite 
and vigorous digestion indicating health. Closely con- 
nected with these processes is the determination of the 
point to which exercise may be carried, in order that it 
shall be followed by the maximum increase in power. 
If the cell activities are viewed as dependent on the 
partial decomposition of complex molecules, then it is 
conceived that this decomposition, when carried to a 
certain point, leaves the cell best prepared to recuperate. 
This optimum can, however, be overstepped, and in- 
stances where persons, after one form and another of 
excessive fatigue, have never completely recovered, are 
too familiar to require specification. Just what this 
limit is, must be determined by personal experiment, 
always keeping in mind that the individual differences 
are very wide. 
Both the sensation of fatigue, and in part the loss 
of power, are regarded as due to substances resulting
-P-A-G-E-313
  FATIGUE. 313 
from the decomposition of the cytoplasm during activity. 
The signs of fatigue can thus be ‘induced in a dog at 
rest by injecting into his vessels the blood of a dog 
that has been wearied (Mosso). The substances thus 
passed into the blood are not only deterrent to the 
activity of the cells which produce them, but to the 
other cells with which they are brought in contact by 
the circulation. Thus local exercise produces general 
weariness. Moreover, these substances are probably 
different, and have a different physiological value 
according to the tissues in which they originate. The 
fatigue from nervous activity differs from that due to mus- 
cular exertion or over-eating. When some error in the 
elimination or chemical destruction of these substances 
occurs, there may develop a genuine auto-intoxica- 
tion the effects of which can apparently be wide- 
reaching.? 
Healthy weariness is followed by sleep—a condition 
hard to define. Unconsciousness may be produced by 
a blow on the head, by drugs, extreme cold, hypnotic 
suggestion, compression of the carotid arteries, and so 
on: from these conditions normal sleep is distinguished 
by the fact that it is refreshing ; and so far as it departs 
from this character, it fails of its purpose. The animals 
in which the habit of rhythmic sleep is best developed 
are the birds and higher mammals, and among these it 
is especially those in which the encephalon is most 
elaborated that there is a sharp contrast between 
activity and repose. In these forms the central cells 
are proportionately well developed, and thus there is 
some reason to associate this condition with variations 
in the functions of this group. At the same time, the 
higher animals have it in common with the lower, that 
* Cowles, Meurasthenia and its Mental Symptoms, Shattuck 
Lecture, Boston, 1891.
-P-A-G-E-314
  314 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
some reflexes are still easily aroused even in this state, 
while others, like the knee-kick, are lost. 
The waste products of activity appear as the prime 
cause of sleep, and on them is probably dependent the 
distribution of the blood which has been observed 
during this condition. The effective blood supply of 
the nerve centres is increased in the first stages of 
activity, and diminishes in fatigue (Mosso). It is 
diminished during sleep also. Any stimulus acting on 
the sensory nerves during sleep tends to cause a with- 
drawal of blood from the limbs, and its return to the 
head as shown in the observations of Bardeen and 
Nichols previously quoted. 
Sleep is more easily induced, the fewer the stimuli 
that act upon us. Not only, then, the condition of the 
afferent nerves, but also the responsiveness of the 
central cells toward the impulses that fall upon them, 
are to be taken into account. In common practice we 
reduce stimuli to a minimum as a preliminary to sleep. 
Striimpell* has reported an interesting case of a lad of 
low intelligence, who by disease had been reduced to 
one ear and one eye as the sole avenues by which he 
received external stimuli. When the ear was plugged, 
and the eye bandaged, he fell asleep with the regularity 
of a machine. 
The parts played by the sensory and that by the 
central cells vary somewhat at different times of life. 
In childhood the amount of stored material is small, 
large at maturity, and small again in old age. Hence 
the cells would, by reason of this fact, have the greatest 
capability for work in the middle period. Between child- 
hood and old age there is, however, this difference, that 
while in the former the non-available substances in the 
cell are developing, not yet having matured, those in

the latter have in some way become incapable of 
reconstruction. With this change in the nerve elements 
goes the remarkable power in the blood vessels to vary 
their diameter, and thus control the supply of blood. 
The limits of this variation probably increase to 
maturity, and in old age are greatly diminished, so that 
the calibre becomes more constant. The degrees to 
which the blood supply can be controlled, and the

amount of substance capable of yielding energy at 
various periods of life are so different, that considering 
these factors alone, though there are probably others, it 
may be easily appreciated that the sleep of childhood, 
maturity, and old age should be quite different. 
During sleep stimuli can always produce an effect, 
otherwise a person could not be wakened. When
-P-A-G-E-316

applied to the cranial nerves the sleeper is apt to be 
recalled to consciousness by the redistribution of his 
blood, the supply to the encephalon being increased.t 
Kohlschiitter has reported observations on the depth of 
sleep, which was measured by the height from which 
a falling ball must drop in order to make a sound suffi- 
ciently loud to waken the sleeper. 
_ The ease with which the subject awakens is mani- 
festly not a measure of recuperation, since after two 
and a half hours of sleep a very slight stimulus is 
efficient. A condition permitting the diffusion of the 
auditory stimuli is therefore established long before the 
reconstructive changes in the cells in general are com- 
plete, and there is reason to think that the first change 
is due to an increased supply of blood to the central 
system, after which the constructive processes slowly 
follow in the cells. For this last, a period of four hours 
or more is usually demanded, and when less time 
is allowed, the cells return to work under great 
disadvantages. 
The feat of walking one thousand miles in a thousand 
hours, at the rate of a mile an hour, leaves the pedes- 
trian with at least two-thirds of each hour unoccupied, 
yet it requires the greatest endurance, from the fact of the 
discontinuity of sleep; not only, therefore, the amount 
of time taken for sleep, but the length of the single 
periods, is significant. Continuous loss of sleep is far 
more rapidly fatal than starvation, and the final changes 
are very marked, especially in the nervous system.? 
These physiological phenomena are correlated with 
the anatomical variations found in the cell elements at 
different times. The changes which occur in the bodies 
of nerve cells as the result of their activity have been

of mixed spinal nerves ; the condition of the spinal 
ganglion cells, with which the sensory fibres were 
connected, was then examined ; the cells in the gang- 
lion on the side of stimulation being compared with 
those from the opposite ganglion of the same animal. 
As a result of stimulation in this way, the fatigued 
cells appear shrunken, and their reaction to staining 
reagents changed, thus showing a chemical alteration. 
The shrinkage involves the nuclei of the capsule sur- 
rounding these elements as well as the nucleolus, 
nucleus, and cytoplasm of the cells themselves, the last 
becoming vacuolated. In the accompanying figure (73) 
these differences can be seen by comparing the fatigued 
cells B with the normal cells A. 
As the most clearly marked differences were found 
in the nuclei, these were further studied. Their volume 
decreases according to the length of time that they 
are stimulated, as indicated in Table 58.

to man, there is little doubt of their complete applica- 
bility. 
It should be mentioned that some more recent 
observations by Mann? have confirmed the changes 
found by Hodge after prolonged exertion, and have 
added the motor cells of the spinal cord and the 
elements of the retina (dog) to the list of those in 
which they occur. This author agrees with Vas,? 
however, in finding a preliminary swelling of the cell 
and its nucleus after a short period of stimulation, the 
change having been observed in both sympathetic and 
cerebral retinal cells, and both those authors have added 
interesting observations concerning the rearrangement 
of the chromatic substance as the result of stimulation. 
Physiologists have been busy at the same time 
seeking to determine how far the passage of a nerve 
impulse along a fibre causes fatigue-changes in_ it. 
Thermal and chemical changes in the nerve fibres have 
not been clearly proven. After very prolonged stimula- 
tion by electricity, the nerve still remains permeable to 
impulses thus aroused.3 Neither have definite morpholo- 
gical changes been satisfactorily demonstrated.4 This is 
the more interesting, since the nerve fibre is a direct 
prolongation of the cell body, and also since other ex-

nerve fibres are not necessarily present in the same

In starvation the central system is the one least 
affected in its gross weight,5 and there is little doubt 
that this weight is maintained at the expense of the

other systems—a relation the utility of which is plain, 
but the mechanism of which is quite unexplained. 
In general the fatigue which controls us is, in so large 
a measure, dependent on the nervous system that there 
is reason to make the changes occurring there the most 
prominent, though it can also be shown that the glands 
and muscles undergo changes as the result of activity, 
and a complete discussion of the subject would involve 
all the active tissues. 
There is, then, an anatomy as well as a physiology of 
fatigue, and the facts grouped together permit the 
following general statement. After recuperative sleep 
the cells in the central system are full-sized and 
granular, the blood flows with a medium pressure 
through the nerve centres; slight stimuli elicit a ready 
response, and there are general sensations of vigour 
and well-being. From the beginning of the day the 
process of running down goes on, all the constant 
stimuli hasten it, meals retard it, drugs modify it, 
according to their nature. In general there is a 
tendency to run down towards the middle of the after- 
noon, with a return of vigour later in the day. On this 
long rhythm is superposed one by which in the evening 
the blood supply to the brain diminishes at the accus- 
tomed hour of retiring. This change in the blood 
supply appears to depend on the waste substances pro- 
duced by the active cells. These accumulate faster 
than they are removed, and render activity more 
difficult. At the beginning of sleep these substances 
are abundant, the stored material in the cells is small, 
and the cells themselves are shrunken in various ways. 
Slowly the toxic products of metabolism are removed, 
and at the end of two or three hours the sleeper is in 
a state to be readily awakened, though physiological 
recuperation has but just begun. The circulation has

become better, the constructive changes ‘in the cells 
continue, and at the end of the interval the nerve cells 
are restored and the body prepared for the next period 
of work.

IN advanced life the grosser changes in the body due 
to growth are amply evident. By the condensation of 
the skeleton and the greater curvature of the spine the 
stature decreases towards the evening of life just as 
towards the evening of each day the body has become 
shorter. The bodily temperature falls from o'I-0'5°C. 
below that found in the prime of life The weight of 
the active tissues decreases, that of the cell-multiplying 
and blood-producing organs being most diminished,? 
but this decrease may be masked by the accumulation 
of fat, though this also disappears in persons very old. 
It has been suggested that even the shape of the skull 
may alter at this time, but sufficient evidence for this 
view is not forthcoming. In these total changes the 
central nervous system bears its part. The tables (13 
and 29) in Chapters IV. and VI. show that for sane and 
insane persons of both sexes, the encephalic weight is

least in the group of the aged, 70-90 years. As com- 
pared with the 20-40 years’ group, the percentage value 
of the cerebrum is slightly reduced in the sane, the 
reduction being most marked in the females. Among 
the insane this variation in the percentage does not 
occur. The observations by ‘Bischoff* indicate that 
the final decrease in the weight of the encephalon 
begins in men at about fifty-five years, and in women 
some years earlier (Fig. 76). Above these curves is

deferred till after sixty-five years. 
This difference is important. The contrast. here is 
between a favoured social class, the eminent men, and 
the much less favoured class from which Bischoff’s 
data were drawn, and it needs but a moment’s thought 
to see that the favourable conditions might thus tend 
to defer the onset of decay. This, however, is not the

whole story. The eminent men have not only the 
heavier, but the better organised brains ; this organisa- 
tion being dependent in part on prolonged growth, a 
condition which would also tend to defer senescence. 
For these reasons the time at which decay commences 
in the least favoured classes is probably early as com- 
pared with the time in those more happily circumstanced. 
But here again the incompleteness of the data must be 
noted. 
Some effort has been made to determine how the 
several lobes of. the cerebrum are affected by the 
general diminution in its weight. The tables here 
given have been taken from Topinard. Each cerebral 
hemisphere, the pia having been removed, was divided 
(Broca), as shown in Fig. 30. This gives the sub- 
divisions of the hemispheres, including both basal 
ganglia and mantle, as presented in the tables which 
follow.

The records show a similar distribution of loss in the 
two sexes, though it is absolutely greater in the males 
than in the females. Especially heavy is the loss in the 
frontal lobes of the males. Expressing these absolute 
figures as percentages, the weight of the entire ence- 
phalon in each sex being represented by 1,000, the 
results shown in Table 60 are obtained.

The proportions of the cerebrum thus divided are 
nearly the same for both sexes at the two age periods. 
The most marked difference is in the temporo-parietal 
lobes, the proportional value of which in both sexes 
decreases 1'5 per cent. with advanced age. The occi- 
pital lobes in the aged are something more than 1 per 
cent. heavier. In the male, age produces:a proportional 
decrease in the weight of the frontal lobes, whereas in 
the females there is an increase. Of changes in the 
weight of the spinal cord nothing is known, neither are 
there any studies of old age in animals which illustrate 
the changes in the nervous system.  
-P-A-G-E-328
  328 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN, 
The thickness of the cerebral cortex diminishes in 
harmony with the shrinkage of the entire system. In 
large measure this must depend on the loss of volume 
in the various fibre systems, which, according to the 
tables from Vulpius (Chapter XIV.), show a senile 
decrease in the number of fibres composing them. This 
decrease is more marked in the motor than in the sen- 
sory areas. The time at which it commences cannot, 
however, be well judged from the curve mentioned, 
owing to the small number of records after the thirty- 
third year. Where records are made between this and 
the seventy-ninth year, it appears that there is no decided 
diminution until after the fiftieth year, though at the 
seventy-ninth the decrease is always clearly shown. 
Engel has shown that the branches of the arbor vitae 
of the human cerebellum decrease in size and number 
in old age. See Fig. 45.1 
To the anatomy of the human nervous system in old 
age contributions have been made by studies on the 
pathological anatomy of paralysis agitans.? 
In subjects suffering from this affection the bodies of 
the nerve cells are shrunken, pigmented, and show in 
some cases a granular degeneration; the fibres, in part, 
are atrophied and degenerated, the supporting tissues 
increased, and the walls of the small blood-vessels 
thickened. These changes have been found principally 
in the spinal cord, being most marked in the lumbar 
region. But the cords of the aged persons who do not 
exhibit the symptoms of paralysis agitans show similar 
changes, though usually they are not so marked, and 
hence the pathologic anatomy of this disease resolves 
itself into a somewhat. premature and excessive senility 
of the central system.

A careful study of senile nerve cells has been made 
by Hodge.t On examining the central system of a 
man dying naturally at ninety-two years, very marked 
changes were found in the cells of the spinal ganglia 
when compared with those of the corresponding ganglion 
taken from a child at birth. The principal differences 
are summarised in Table 61.

The nuclei have decreased and become irregular in

osmic acid, and the cytoplasm is much pigmented, but 
these cells differ from those fatigued (cat) in that the 
nucleus does not become darker than the cytoplasm. 
In the cerebellum also there was an indication that 
some of the Purkinje’s cells had disappeared and others 
were shrunken. 
Still more marked was the effect of age when the 
nerve cells from the antennary lobe of the honey-bee 
were examined. In old bees these exhibit a vacuolation 
of the cytoplasm and shrinkage of the nucleus which 
makes them quite comparable with the fatigued cells, 
and very different from those of bees which have just

emerged in the perfect form. In this ganglion of the 
bee the cells actually disappear with age, and Hodge 
has estimated that for each cell present at senile death 
there were in the insect just emerged 2°9 cells. 
These changes will probably be found more widely 
distributed in the central system when search is made

central nerve cells most responsive to prolonged abnormal 
conditions of the body even when the disease is located 
quite outside of this system. 
The cause of senile changes in nerve cells cannot be 
given. Could the central system of an aged person be 
transplanted to the body of one in the prime of life, 
possessing a vigorous digestion and perfect circulating 
system, it might be possible to judge how far such 
changes are the results of defects in the systems on 
which the nerve elements depend. Many facts suggest 
that specialisation in the functions of a cell is the first 
step towards its ultimate destruction, and in that sense 
the causes of its death should be mainly inherent. The 
overgrowth by the supporting tissues and intoxication 
through defective nutrient conditions are of great im- 
portance to this senile dissolution, but their exact values 
are necessarily unknown. A dependent system is, how- 
ever, at the mercy of the others with which it is associated, 
and hence the changes caused by defects in the latter 
are to be distinguished from those arising in the former. 
This is especially important when an attempt is made 
to test the hypothesis that the capabilities of the central 
system tend to disappear in an order inverse to that in 
which they have developed. This statement applies to 
changes resident in the nerve elements themselves. 
When it is remembered that the last developed cells 
are smallest, and have but a small quantity of cytoplasm, : 
that the very tardiness of their development indicates 
their environment to have been less favourable, and 
finally that those conditions which retard growth also 
favour senescence, the hypothesis appears plausible. In 
looking for the anatomical changes in this instance it is 
to be. remembered that there is no proof that the inter-

  332 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
ruption of a portion of those paths by which the im- 
pulses pass from one element to another need cause the 
complete disappearance of the elements thus discon- 
nected, especially if the break involves only a few of 
the terminals of the nerve fibre ; and so the slow physio- 
logical disorganisation of the completed central system 
is not necessarily accompanied by a corresponding 
amount of atrophy. 
The old age of the central system is in a measure 
independent of the degree to which it is exercised, 
unless the exercise be so excessive as to cause continual 
and extreme exhaustion. So far as known the lumbar 
enlargement of the sedentary student does not grow old 
faster than that of a professional runner, and on the 
other hand there is no evidence to show that the best 
exercise of the hemispheres does clearly postpone in 
them the involutionary processes. 
It can be easily calculated how many times the heart 
will beat, the lungs expand, and each of the many bodily 
functions repeat itself in the course of an ordinary life. 
Among these functions are the regular changes in the 
nerve cells. Without doubt this rhythm (recuperation 
and fatigue) repeats itself each day, and thus all persons 
undergo alterations of the nervous system as regular as 
those which occur in stature, but the intensity of this 
change is an individual matter, and perhaps not funda- 
mentally important as a physiological phenomenon. 
Viewed from this side, therefore, much truth is contained 
in the observation that, though the differences between 
men are slight, yet such as they are, they amount to 
a great deal. 
All through life, one after another, the various capa- 
bilities drop away. The power of visualisation is lost, 
pleasure in music disappears, memory becomes weak, 
save in narrow lines; a new language, a new science,
-P-A-G-E-333
  OLD AGE. 333 
or a new handicraft appear as very serious undertakings, 
and as a rule are only indifferently acquired. Yet there 
can be no doubt that when a capability is lost, then 
somewhere in the central system a physiological change, 
if not a structural one, has rendered the cells less active. 
As behind each functional advance there must be a 
further structural organisation, so diminished organisa- 
tion must accompany each loss of power. Of such slow 
changes in ourselves we are happily for some time 
unconscious, and the beginnings are to be discovered 
only by the application of some exact measure of the 
reaction. In his essay on Old Age, Sir J. Crichton 
Browne gives some interesting observations bearing on 
this loss of capability.t | From these it appears that in 
England the expertness of the Birmingham button- 
makers, the Staffordshire potters, and the Bradford 
weavers increases from the time of entering their trade 
at about seventeen years up to thirty years of age. 
From this until forty-five years there is a period of 
equilibrium, and then a decline sets in. The following 
table illustrates the manner in which the productiveness 
of a maker of vegetable ivory buttons, working the same 
number of hours, decreases with advancing years.

  334 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
Statistics of this sort are very important, and there 
should be more of them. At the same time they must 
be interpreted with caution. The monotony of exis- 
tence and the general environment of the button-makers 
is probably conducive to an early decline. Further, this 
decline may be directly dependent on changes in the 
spinal cord rather than the cerebrum. Finally the 
muscles as well as the central system are involved, and 
there is no collateral proof that other capabilities begin 
their decline at the same time or continue it at a similar 
rate. The false inferenee to be here avoided is the 
same that was pointed out in connection with the 
diminution of brain-weight due to age. The conclu- 
sions are applicable to other artisans under like con- 
ditions, but not necessarily to those living under quite 
different conditions. Yet there is abundant evidence 
that the capacity for very high-grade manual work de- 
manding concentrated attention and judgment is limited 
to a decade or two at the prime of life, and the history 
of champion athletes points to like limitations. 
In this connection the fact that there is a multiple 
innervation of many parts of the body is perhaps signi- 
ficant. In its simplest form this means, for example, that 
a given muscle can be contracted in nearly the same way 
under the influence of different sets of nerve elements. 
Expertness translated into physiological terms must 
mean the use of the same elements in the same way to 
produce a given result. The mechanical precision would 
be much increased by this, but the strain would always 
fall on the same elements, which in the case of a manual 
art are almost certain to be over-exercised. This estab- 
lishment of a preferred pathway tends to the suppression 
of activity in the other possible pathways, and to the 
abolition of that fringe of connections which is normally 
present in every pathway, but the existence of which,
-P-A-G-E-335
  OLD AGE. 335 
though conducive to the general health of any portion of 
the central system, is a source of disturbance when great 
precision is to be attained. Leaving aside the general 
characters of the last of the “seven ages” of human life 
which the physicians and poets of all time have united 
in depicting, there is one aspect of this period, so far as it 
concerns the nervous system, which may be emphasised. 
The conditions of this system in old age and in fatigue 
are closely similar, though the tired cell in the prime of 
life still possesses the power of recuperation, which in 
old age is wanting. Even in youth extreme fatigue 
brings with it the bodily expression of age and the 
feeling of decrepitude, and in many ways the two con- 
ditions thus approximate, although it is recognised that 
fatigue depends on. the exhaustion of stored material 
and senility on the failure of the power to restore it in 
full measure, but how the one stage passes over to the 
other, or why, are problems still untouched.

EDUCATION consists in modifications of the central 
nervous system. For this experience the cell elements 
are peculiarly fitted. They are plastic in the sense that 
their connections are not rigidly fixed, and they re- 
member, or, to use a physiological expression, tend to 
repeat previous reactions. By virtue of these powers 
the cells can adjust themselves to new surroundings, and 
further learn to respond with great precision and 
celerity to such impulses as are familiar because im- 
portant. 
In its size and development the central system is 
precocious. Long before birth all the cells destined to 
compose it are already formed, though by no means all 
are developed in the sense that they have acquired the 
form and connections characteristic for those at maturity. 
At the close of embryonic life the sensory nerves rapidly 
extend, and the connection of the central cells with 
A 336

limiting surfaces of the body being thus established, all 
experiences become those of education, The act of 
living is thus the most important natural educational 
process with which the human body has to do, yet it 
is usual to restrict the term education to a series of 
formal events falling within the period of school life. 
Formal education as such may have objects which are 
quite as distinct as those of gymnastics and athletics 
in the field of muscular training. In their extreme 
forms these two aims are distinguished by the fact that 
the athletic or tectihical training fits the individual to do 
some one thing which in his day and generation is con- 
sidered desirable, while the culture or gymnastic method 
seeks to round him by the better exercise of weaker 
points, so that his activities may become more complete. 
In earlier education the culture method, though often 
disguised, is yet the one mainly pursued, and it is the 
significance of this method which will here be considered. 
In the development of the central system it is found 
that an anatomical framework is first formed. In this 
framework are represented, in outline, the nerve struc- 
tures whose functions are most fundamental. These 
with later growth are locally strengthened and organ- 
ised, and by the establishment of associative paths 
gain both a wider influence and greater complexity of 
reaction. 
In the history of this unfolding of the nervous centres, 
atavistic tendencies crop out. Most interesting, perhaps, 
are the prehensile powers of the great toe, and the 
clinging powers of infants during the first four weeks 
of life These capacities, like the sucking reflex, dis- 
appear sooner or later, leaving no trace behind, but 
there can be little doubt that proper examination of 
the centres concerned would show an histological basis

-P-A-G-E-338
  338 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
for the reactions. It is but rarely that a vanishing 
power can be thus tracked, but there is ample sug- 
gestion that many ancestral phases are for a time 
exhibited and then outgrown by the maturing brain. 
Among the developing functions sensibility comes first. 
Indeed the sensory system in certain human monsters 
may be well developed, although both central, and 
motor elements are quite wanting.t To this general 
sensitiveness, evident early in foetal life, and without 
which the central system ceases to be significant, there 
are rapidly added, about the time of birth or shortly 
after, the more special sensations of taste, smell, touch, 
hearing, sight, and of temperature. Then, as organi- 
sation progresses, come the emotions of fear, astonish- 
ment, anger, closely followed by the development of 
the intellect and will, with the power of: language and 
self-consciousness. This is not the place to essay the 
reduction of all these various expressions, intended to 
indicate grades of mental development dependent on 
the organisation of the central cells, to their physio- 
logical equivalents. Since the special senses first 
become useful, the various reactions of the individual 
are customarily associated with one or another of them. 
That this is somewhat a matter of chance the education 
of all defectives shows. The development of the parts 
of the brain devoted to the mediation of the special 
sensations as well as the sense organs ? (Luckey) like 
those of hearing and sight, is rapid at first, then slow, 
yet continuous up to maturity, as is seen in the curves 
for cortical growth, already given. With the refinement 
in sense perception and the accompanying central 
changes, comes a corresponding increase 'in the control 
of the motor elements, and in these latter an increase

  THE EDUCATION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 339 
in the strength, accuracy, and readiness with which they 
respond. 
Such is the development from the standpoint of the 
increasing organisation of the system at large. Among 
the sensory and central constituents are changes of a 
different sort. In the very young the mental processes 
are limited by the fact that memory is very poor. As 
this power increases it becomes possible to hold the 
mental image for a longer time, until finally a large 
fraction of the mental operations involves the employ- 
ment of such images which may be present in the 
terms of any sense. Thus the child first receives 
impressions which are quickly lost, then those which 
are remembered for a time, and finally he accumu- 
lates a store of memories which enter as modifying 
factors into all subsequent mental activity. In advanced 
age the mental activities have it in common with those 
of childhood that the images are easily mislaid, but 
when available during the period of senescence they are 
more complete than during the earlier stages of growth. 
The study of sensory aphasia, designating by this a 
loss of the power of recognition or expression conse- 
quent on injury to the sensory or central elements, 
has helped much to the understanding of the manner 
in which our ideas are built up during the formative 
period. Analysis indicates that the notion of a brass 
bell is built up from its smell, taste, temperature, 
weight, shape, colour, and the sound it makes, though 
the information obtained through the eye and the ear 
is that on which we commonly rely ; but a blind-deaf 
person would emphasise the other sources of infor-

a bell it may be indicated on our part by a sound:

sort: a picture or the written word. In the ordinary

right-handed person it is the injury to the left cerebral 
hemisphere between the sensory and motor regions that 
most often gives rise to symptoms of aphasia. The 
symptoms vary with the location and extent of the lesion, 
but depend on the stoppage or diminution of the nerve 
impulse at some point between its arrival at the cortex 
and its transfer to the efferent central cells, used for the 
response. The study of aphasic patients has brought out 
the fact that any one or more of the several events in- 
volved in recognising the bell by means of the principal 
senses, and expressing this recognition in the usual 
way, by the written or the spoken word, may drop out. 
So, for example, the patient may be unable to speak or 
write the word “bell” when a bell is simply seen, but at 
the same time be able to do both if it is also rung. Or 
the sound may elicit only the written but not the 
spoken word, and so on through the possible combina- 
tion of sensations and forms of expression. 
Thus the impulses reaching an expressive centre, and 
proving too weak to cause the discharge of it, may still 
prove efficient if combined with the corresponding im- 
pulses from another sensory centre to which the object 
also appeals. It is therefore the passing of the impulses 
from all the sensory centres stimulated by the object that 
gives the basis for the most perfect response. Clinical 
studies of the kind furnish grounds for the idea that the 
presentation of an object to any one of the senses revives 
the mental image of that object in terms of the other 
senses which may be, and formerly have been, excited 
by it, and that the more vivid these associated images, 
the more complete and clear is the conception. As the 
possibility of forming the extra images is curtailed, the 
conception becomes weaker, more special, and less 
reliable. 
When the sight of the bell causes it to be named, the

changes in the brain are not duplicates of those occur- 
ring when the sound of it has led to the same reaction. 
In the two cases the same expressive centres have been 
directly roused by different sets of fibres, one from the 
auditory and one from the visual centres, and the 
secondary revivals have been correspondingly varied. 
The bearings of these facts are very wide. Among 
mammals it is a familiar observation that some, like the 
rat, are dependent on the sense of hearing, or like the 
cat, on that of sight, or the dog, on that of smell. This 
means that the mental images which rule these animals 
are in terms of the dominant sense, and anatomically 
that the cortical centres for the dominant sense are 
those best connected with the motor areas. When men 
are compared, there are possibilities for very wide 
differences in these arrangements, the eye rather than 
the ear being generally the dominant organ. -Some- 
thing of this is doubtless due to training, but probably 
much more to anatomy. It is interesting to note that 
in these days of printing a large proportion of our 
second-hand information reaches us through the eye, 
while in the earlier centuries the ear was the main 
channel. Further, owing to anatomical peculiarities 
an individual may be persuasive with his pen and 
yet a doubtful orator. Such every-day combinations 
may be easily explained. The same sensory portions 
of the brain are not connected impartially with either 
the centre for the movement of the hand and arm 
in writing or that for the muscles of phonation used in 
speech ; but there may be wide differences in this relation, 
so that the speaking and the writing man are somewhat 
different persons. The working value of the mental 
images appears also as dependent on the number and 
balance of the secondary sensations which accompany 
them. The greater the number of these the more

certain and precise is our thought. For this reason the 
development of the intelligence is associated with the 
perfection of more than. one sense organ, whereas 
reliance on a single avenue of sense, while it may lead 
to very precise reactions graded in accordance with the 
intensity of the single sort of stimulus, leaves us without 
those fringing sensations which form the basis for dis- 
tinction and comparison. 
In biological equations the values of the different 
factors are often open to wide variation. We have 
insisted on the three-fold composition of the central 
system, one factor being afferent or sensory, another 
central or distributive, and the third motor or efferent ; 
each one of these divisions represented by distinct 
anatomical cell groups. It is readily seen that a high 
deerce of responsiveness among the central cells gives 
us the intellectual type of reaction. Where the efferent 
portion is well organised, we have the anatomical con- 
ditions, or the man of affairs or action, while exaggera- 
tion of the afferent or sensory component leads to a 
merely passive existence, or to hysteria, according to 
circumstances. 
Connections between the exercises of formal educa- 
tion and brain change have not been demonstrated. 
It is not known how a year’s schooling affects the 
central system, and it is not probable that we shall 
soon arrive at facts of this sort. Available, however, 
are the facts of anatomical growth during this period, 
and to these plausible explanations have been given. 
The aim at the moment, therefore, is to determine 
what limitations anatomy places to the educational 
process, and thus to obtain a rational basis from which 
to attack many of the’ pedagogical problems. It ap- 
pears probable that the education of the schools is but 
one, and that, too, rather an insignificant one, of many

surrounding conditions influencing growth. The average 
individual is first subjected to some formal training when 
about three years of age. At this time the number of 
cell elements is complete, and the history of future organi- 
sation has been in its broad outlines determined by their 
first arrangement. Examination shows that but a fraction 
of the elements have begun to develop, though growth 
is everywhere visible, and some of the elements have 
attained almost their full size. The encephalon at this 
age has more than two-thirds its adult weight. It is 
during this last stage of the growing period, which to be 
sure may continue into the forties, that formal educa- 
tion is called upon to modify the central system. In 
these pages it has been maintained that this modification 
might go on without great increase in weight, though 
with much effect on the organisation, because although 
in many cases the nerve elements were in the granule 
stage of development and without prolongations, yet in 
many others they possessed prolongations which had 
taken all but the last step necessary to the establish- 
ment of full functional connection with neighbouring 
cells, and hence for such cells the constructional change 
demanded was very small. The impulse to this change 
in any part of the system is seen to be the improved 
circulation, giving a larger nutritive supply, and the 
direct.action of the nerve impulses putting the cells in a 
chemical condition to best make use of the surrounding 
nutriment. Such being the conditions, two things must 
happen. Education must fail to produce any funda- 
mental changes in the nervous organisation, but to some 
extent it can strengthen formed structures by exercise, 
and in part waken into activity the ugorganised remnant 
of the dormant cells. No amount of cultivation will 
give good growth where the nerve cells are few and ill- 
nourished, but careful culture can do much where there

are those with strong inherent impulses towards develop- 
ment. On neurological grounds, therefore, nurture is to 
be considered of much less importance than nature,? 
and in that sense the capacities that we most admire in 
persons worthy of remark are certainly inborn rather 
than made. 
Among children there are the widest variations in 
congenital composition of the central systems, and 
similarity is neither desirable nor liable to occur save 
among the members of the same family, or, better still, 
in cases of twins. It has been made probable that by 
the cultivating processes of school-training the formed 
structures tend to be strengthened, dormant elements 
roused to further growth and organisation, and made 
more perfect in this or that direction according to the 
nature of the exercise. By strengthening the formed 
cells their powers of differential reaction, of organic 
memory, and resistance to fatigue are increased. By 
associating given sets of muscular reactions with given 
sense impressions habits are formed, in consequence of 
further organisations among the nerve elements, and 
finally nutritive rhythms associated with the periods of 
activity and rest are established, with the result of econo- 
mising the bodily energy, and rendering its expenditure 
more effective. 
In general the power of sense discrimination increases 
with age, because such discrimination depends mainly 
on central arrangements which are not elaborated in the 
earliest years, but where it depends on peripheral arrange- 
ments the power may in some cases decrease with age. 
Thus Czermak 2 has brought forward evidence that the 
power to discriminate two points on the skin is rather 
finer in children than in adults, owing to the better

innervation of the skin in the former. For as growth 
proceeds the skin increases in area more rapidly than 
the nerves which supply it increase in number. In the 
power of discrimination based on the condition of the 
peripheral sense organs will probably be found the 
anatomical condition controlling in large measure the 
scale of human performance. Here we have in mind 
the size of things made by man, ranging from the 
minute and painfully detailed constructions to the 
broad and carelessly general. Perhaps the extremes in 
scales in painting and sculpture will best illustrate the 
point. A Meissonier and Munkacsy could not inter- 
change their styles at will, nor would the style of Michael 
Angelo suit the needs of an engraver of gems. 
While in long periods fatigue in mental operations 
can be demonstrated, in short periods the results are 
not so clear, owing in part to the confusion caused by 
the daily rhythms. Moreover, in the longer tests it is 
difficult to give proper values to the quantitative reduc- 
tion in the work done, and at the same time to the 
decrease in accuracy, since the two do not run a parallel 
course (Burgerstein,' Laser2). Ebbinghaus3 has made 
the most elaborate tests on memory, and although his 
experiments were undertaken on himself alone, they 
suffice to show the easy onset of fatigue and the 
enormous value of exercise alternating with even 
lengthy periods of rest. Bolton,# who studied in 
scholars from eight to fifteen years of age the memory 
span for a series of digits up to nine, found the length 
of the span as well as the accuracy of its repro- 
duction to increase with age. These improvements in

children of the ages below given, to determine the 
strength of their grip, as shown by the dynamometer. 
The figures expressing the power of the grip for each

tions.

To be noted in this table is the remarkable increase

“The Autobiography of a Strength Seeker”? contains a 
record of most remarkable gains in strength later in 
life. The case of Windship is certainly exceptional, but 
is here of interest by reason of the fact that, though 
these gains are usually a mixed result of changes in the 
muscle as well as the central nervous system, yet the 
later in life they occur the more the central system must 
be held responsible for them, since the muscles soon 
reach a limit of growth. The capabilities of the nerve

cells are far beyond the limits of their ordinary per- 
formance. It will serve to suggest the latent possi- 
bilities of this sort resident in the central system if 
we recall the strength of very moderately developed 
men suddenly exhibited during attacks of maniacal 
frenzy. 
In all functional activities a tendency to the formation 
of habits occurs. Concerning these associations there is 
one feature of much educational importance, generally 
recognised, to be sure, but which at the same time has 
been made more clear by the investigations of Berg- 
strom.? In these experiments the test was to sort as 
rapidly as possible, and according to suit, a pack of 
cards, placing them in piles on a table. Another pack, 
with the cards in a different order, was then taken, and 
the experiment repeated. This second trial took much 
longer than the first. The increase in the time was 
found to be due, not to fatigue, but to certain associa- 
tions formed during the first sorting, whereby a given 
suit was connected with a pile having a given location 
on the table. In the second pack the order of the 
cards was of course different; the suits on the table 
were therefore differently located, and the memories of 
the first associations still persisting, they directly inter- 
fered with the second performance, causing false move- 
ments, and so increasing the time. The demonstration 
here of the loss of energy in learning what needs only 
to be unlearned is very striking, and if one experience 
produces such an effect it is not difficult to understand 
how habits early formed and long cultivated become so 
difficult of eradication. With habits come rhythms in 
activity, and, recognising the importance of rhythms of 
this nature, the training may be adjusted to them, thus 
catching the system at the most favourable moments.

348 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
In this history of organisation there are many errors, 
happily for the most part transient. Here belong 
all those vague suggestions of a second personality 
which in growing children are so perplexing and so 
numerous. Sometimes these phases periodically recur,* 
and at adolescence they are most accentuated. They 
represent the disharmony of the first steps in change 
and progress, and, like mirror-script, gibberish talk and 
the various forms of general inanity are but intermediate 
phases between the imbecility of the infant and the 
intelligence of the adult.2 The intensity with which any 
form of exercise is carried on during the growing period 
leaves its trace, and the absence of it at the proper time 
is for the most part irremediable. We should hardly 
expect much appreciation of colour in a person brought 
up in the dark, however good his natural endowments 
in this direction. Thus any lack of early experience 
may leave a spot permanently undeveloped in the central 
system—a condition of much significance, for each 
locality in the cerebrum is not only a place at which 
reactions, using the word in a narrow sense, may occur, 
but by way of it pass fibres having more distant con- 
nections, and its lack of development probably reduces 
the associative value of these also. , 
It is now recognised that thought can be carried 
on in terms of the several senses. In this connection 
Fraser 3 has made an examination of certain philosophic 
writers which indicates that particular writers or schools 
prefer sense-images of one mode in their speculative 
thought, and he suggests that much of the failure to 
be mutually comprehensible, depends on the fact that

tactual and visual images, for example, are by no means 
capable of being manipulated in the same manner, and 
hence that relations conceivable in the terms of one are 
often not so in those of the other. With the employ- 
ment of one sort of mental image comes precision, but 
it is precision gained at the price of limitations. 
Fortunately the law of the diffusion of incoming im- 
pulses works against a too great specialisation in this 
direction. Yet in the highly defective this specialisa- 
tion must be carried very far, and in those whose 
endowments are distinctly unusual the dominance of 
one sense in controlling the reactions of the central 
system may rise to the dignity of a deformity. It 
would be a pallid truism to insist that persons are 
very different in the anatomy of their nervous system, 
and also in their nervous activities, were it not that 
educational practice appears so often to start from quite 
contrary assumptions. 
The description of racial differences in nervous re- 
actions forms a literature by itself, and the traits of 
widely separated classes in the same community are 
almost as different as those of unlike races. In Bavaria 
Ranke! found the cranial capacity of the townspeople 
distinctly greater than that of the peasants in the sur- 
rounding country—a relation which probably means that 
in general the better endowed individuals sought the 
severer struggle of the town with its greater excitements 
and compensations. It is to be anticipated that one 
great difference in races will be found to lie in the 
extent of growth and organisation in the nervous system 
after birth, and especially after puberty. Should it turn 
out on further examination that some of the lower 
races lose their capacity for later training after adoles- 
cence, we should look with interest for the changes in 
* Ranke, Der Mensch., 1894.  
-P-A-G-E-350
  350 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
the cerebral cortex in order to determine whether growth 
there practically ceased at puberty; for, by contrast, 
Venn, studying the size of the head in Cambridge 
students, found it on the average greatest and growing 
for the longest time in the group of most successful 
men. The accomplishments of this fortunate group are 
therefore to be associated with innate capacities, and 
have small ethical significance ; they may be admirable, 
just as are the paces of a well-bred colt, but the 
colt deserves no credit for its gait. Indeed the obser- 
vations of Ranke just quoted, stand as an anthropo- 
logical verification of that tendency so to use our 
native endowments as to get from them all the stimu- 
lation of which our sensory systems are capable. It is 
a deeply seated impulse. The defective sense organ or 
the paralysed limb are often treated very roughly in 
the vain hope of getting a sensation from them. It 
would appear that. the parts of the nervous system cut 
off from their normal stimuli may, so long as they are 
alive, cause their owners much discomfort, and these 
individuals resort to indirect means to get rid of 
the irritation.t The obverse of this appears in the 
“breaking out” experiences so common in all commu- 
nities of growing individuals. In prisons, schools, and 
similar institutions, where hard physical exertion is not 
compulsory, or the routine is deadly monotonous, such 
explosions are bound to occur. Some years ago, when 
college athletics were coming into vogue, Professor 
Richards, of Yale, pointed out that college rows and 
disorders fell off as athletics came in.? It is not easy 
to make experiments of this sort, but there is no doubt 
that during the growing period this surcharging, though

not regular, is an event to be expected, and may take 
almost any form of expression. 
In this connection the consideration of the problems 
of education, as modified by sex, forms an important 
topic. While from the anthropological standpoint there 
is a typical man and typical woman for each race, 
these are not the same for different races. In the 
secondary sexual characters there are some distinctions 
of general applicability—for instance, women are on the 
average smaller than men. Stature and weight are, 
together with proportion, the best marked secondary 
characters by which the sexes are distinguished, and yet 
these overlap in every way. Among such secondary 
characters is that of the nervous system, and there we 
find a similar overlapping. There is no question about 
the fact that women have on the average smaller brains, 
though the record from a better class of women than 
those furnishing the data now employed would perhaps 
raise the average, but these in turn must be compared 
with records from a better class of men. This small 
absolute weight is in no wise mitigated by the fact that 
the weight of the brain as compared with the weight of 
the body is greater in women than in men, for, as we 
have seen in earlier chapters, if that were a criterion, we 
should all bend before the massive intelligence of the 
new-born child, whose proportional brain-weight is six 
times greater than that of the adult. The suggestion 
has been made that the female brain is lighter because 
its structural elements are smaller. Granting this, the 
significance of the absolute size of the elements still 
requires to be explained. The only interpretation that 
we have for the size of these elements is as an expres- 
sion of the power to store and discharge force in a 
short period of time, and to furnish branches for struc- 
tural connections. Such a brain of small elements, no

matter to which sex it belongs, has the same cha- 
racters, but so complicated are the reactions of it 
with nutritive conditions that any inference from mere 
size has little value. If the influence from size were 
applied thoroughly, mental superiority would reside with 
the tall as contrasted with the short men, since as a 
rule tall men have the heavier brains. Size, therefore, 
has a meaning, but is by no means entitled to dominate 
the whole interpretation of the central system. There 
is little or nothing in the weight relations of the female 
encephalon to show it different from that of the male. 
In reactions, however, the female has a more local 
responsiveness than the male, and back of all this is the 
matter of general physiology, which has its distinct 
modifications according to sex. Moreover, it is im- 
possible to escape the conclusion that in women natural 
education is completed only with maternity, which we 
know to effect some slight changes in the sympathetic 
system and possibly the spinal cord, and which may be 
fairly laid under suspicion of causing more structural 
modifications than are at present recognised. Basing 
the inference on the size of the structural elements, 
we should infer that the typical central system in the 
female would be somewhat more easily fatigued, and 
also be slightly less complete in organisation. 
For the rest we have no anatomy, and only modes 
of response, on which to base a judgment. The charac- 
teristic reactions seem in part to depend on fundamental 
physiological differences, in part on the organisation of 
the central system, and in part on nurture. Just how 
far any variations in this last condition will modify the 
reactions of women is at present a matter of experi- 
ment, an experiment in which the brain-weight question 
cuts a much smaller figure than was at one time imagined. 
In all cases the process of education must be much

influenced by mental ripening. The child may be 
precocious or backward. It is interesting to note, 
apropos of what has been said concerning strength and 
size, that precocity is for the most part concerned with 
an early increase in the complexity rather than the 
strength of the reactions; it is a precocity of organisa- 
tion, not of size. Moreover it is apt to appear along 
limited lines only. Physiologically it is growth without 
the usual sensory provocation, and as such renders 
superfluous much of the formal training, the purpose of 
which is to stimulate. Hence the ease with which 
these individuals may learn some things. The best 
studies on the subject show that precocity and genius 
go together. The same conditions which gave the 
individual a generously planned nervous system also 
favour its early development. In such precocious per- 
sons it continues to grow for a longer period than 
usual—a feature which is fully as. important as the 
precocity itself2 It is extremely interesting to see how 
in a series of eminent men, excluding men of action, 
the determination of distinction follows the order in 
which the brain normally attains the high development 
necessary to command recognition in a particular pro- 
fession. 
The manner in which the encephalon becomes organ- 
ised shows that some combinations among the central 
elements are normally completed earlier than others. 
When, however, such sensori-motor connections are once 
established, the time required for their perfection is com- 
paratively short. Further, it appears that high excellence, 
especially in the acts requiring simple sensori-motor 
combinations, is acquired speedily or not at all; and 
thus prolonged exercise, though it may have value as a 
moral training, is insignificant for technical improvement.

Those professions demanding only small acquisition,

and one set of muscles, as between the hand and the

artists, are precocious throughout, while the philo- 
sophers with their need for accumulated information 
and ripened judgment bring up the rear. Similar 
investigations on slightly different material yield 
accordant results.t 
The precocity which is so marked in the formation 
of the structural elements, and the slowness with which 
they complete their organisation and development, are 
features fundamental for the production of a good in- 
telligence, for the first condition supplies the elements 
for response to the various stimuli from without, and 
the second prevents the formation of reactions too

  THE EDUCATION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. 355 
stimulus has given assurance of its importance. From 
such facts the general relations of formal education to 
the growing process are fairly evident. The function of 
it is to round out the original framework of the central 
system, in accordance with the natural provisions there 
present. Without question there is something very 
fatalistic in this. No amount of education will cause 
enlargement or organisation where the rough materials, 
the cells, are wanting; and on the other hand, where 
these materials are present, they will, in some degree, 
become evident, whether purposely educated or not. 
Anatomically, the process of training leads to organisa- 
tion, extending from the centre first developed, so that 
regions isolated in infancy become later more closely 
associated. So, too, it is found that on the motor side, 
the control of a limb by the brain is first established 
over the limb as a whole, since the cells controlling the 
joints nearest the trunk mature earliest. 
Since the cortical centres for the more proximal joints 
tend to be most speedily organised, they become, by 
virtue of this organisation, in some degree a thoroughfare 
for the impulses to the other cortical centres controlling 
the more distal groups of muscles. Thus the impulses 
tend to pass both through the cortex and down the limb 
in regular series.1 Seguin thus found it most advisable 
to begin the training of an idiot hand with movements 
at the shoulder, and the later brain physiology as 
well as the history of growth confirms his method. The 
suggestion from this is that the exercise of those struc- 
tures best formed will most readily arouse to activity 
those next to be developed, and that direct exercise 
should follow close upon the natural extension of the 
growth processes. 
In any special case it is hardly possible to predict

what capabilities may be latent, and earlier education 
thus resolves itself into a reconnoissance among the 
nerve centres for the purpose of finding those which 
will best act together. By consequence the training 
for association comes first, just as precocity tends to 
first take that form, that for dexterity and strength 
being deferred until later. But all growth is accom- 
panied by impulses to activity, due to the surcharging 
of the central system, and these express themselves 
sometimes as disorderly outbreaks, sometimes as en- 
larged susceptibilities. 
Since the beginning of the educational experiment 
at the dawn of civilisation the problem has been to 
rouse an interest in these formal exercises of the 
schools. From the physiological side, that which 
rouses an interest tends to quicken the pulse and 
determine a full blood supply to the entire central 
system, yet the narrow gymnastics of the school, in the 
most austere form, do not in themselves produce that 
condition of good nutrition favouring the best diffusion 
of the impulses and the formation of secondary and 
subconscious associations. The problem, therefore, of 
an emotional background. has been met with a hickory 
stick and with gold, as well as everything between them 
that could be considered as a general excitant; but 
useful as all these methods sometimes are, it has in the 
main only been successfully met by a more subtle 
sympathy and knowledge—a sympathy which in one 
way or another discovered the growing point in the 
child and fitted the task to the necessities of the 
individual. 
There remains another aspect of the subject before 
closing this partial review. The avowed aim of certain 
educational schemes is to produce a rounded, balanced 
individual as an outcome of the training process, a
-P-A-G-E-357

psychological result comparable with the ideal human 
form at one time sought in sculpture. Since conditions 
of life on the globe are not uniform, and since man only 
approaches the ideal in his development when in har- 
mony with his surroundings, such a universal ideal 
is.as fanciful as was the notion of Goethe concerning 
the “Urpflanze” ; a sort of grandfather of all the plants 
possessing the characters of its multiform descendants, 
yet displaying them with an ancestral simplicity worthy 
of the golden age of which it had formed a part. 
As a matter of fact, the education of an individual is a 
very local problem in its details. The weak points in the 
central system must be strengthened, that the abilities 
given by the strong ones may be guided by some sort 
of balanced judgment. But the balanced and judicial 
states are, so far as they go, plainly statical, and the 
vigour of a healthy restlessness is very necessary if 
there is to be advance. While growth continues, things 
bodily and mental are lop-sided, for growth is never 
general, but accentuated, now at one spot, now at 
another. But this very unbalance, if only it be the 
outcome of natural endowment and not of a@ priori 
training, gives a vigour not otherwise to be obtained. 
The history of the normal individual is through 
various phases of unstable equilibrium and awkward 
strength, to the poise and quiescence of late maturity, 
yet in any community examples of all these phases 
are found as terminal. states in both old and young. 
The formal methods, therefore, which shall recognise, 
in the presence of these enormous differences in endow- 
ment, the dynamic value of the natural inequalities of 
growth, and utilise them, preferring irregularity to the 
roundness gained by pruning, will most closely follow 
that which takes place within the body, and thus prove 
most effective.

It is a familiar idea that mental performance is 
accompanied by nervous change. Could the relation 
between these two sets of events be adequately 
explained, at least one fundamental question would be 
answered. Yet to this fatuous task students of science 
are no longer attracted, and the method of the day is to 
attack such problems in detail and indirectly. Thus 
have grown up provisional hypotheses, and present 
controversy centres about the degree of support which 
can be given to these competing explanations. 
Let the explanation, however, be as it may, the prime 
fact remains that the phenomena of consciousness are 
exalted or depressed by purely physical conditions ; 
that they unfold, flourish, and fade within a single 
lifetime, and may be blighted or become monstrous by 
misuse or by disease. This dependence of the mind 
upon the brain is certainly most striking, and it has 
naturally suggested that, by the study of the body 
358
-P-A-G-E-359
  THE WIDER VIEW. 359 
considered as a complex machine, the beginnings and 
relations of mental phenomena could in some cases be 
discovered. Yet by this effort we touch our problem 
on one side only, and so must be prepared to meet 
modifying facts which are certain to come in from other 
sources, 
The problem of education in its most general form 
demands an answer to the question, how the individual 
is to make the best use of his own limited life-cycle, 
while at the same time those larger responsibilities of 
the unit to the race are kept in mind. 
The facts which may be brought forward as materials 
for the reply are, however, very baffling. 
A study of the foregoing tables indicates that races 
which have progressed farthest in civilisation are also 
those which possessa large brain-weight ; but the converse 
of this proposition is by no means true, for the tables also 
show that there are races possessed of a large brain- 
weight and yet uncivilised. It would be hardly fitting 
to introduce here matters which have taxed the best 
ingenuity of the anthropologists, but it is worth while, 
perhaps, to make some effort towards the clear expres- 
sion of the fact that so-called civilisation is not 
necessarily accompanied by an increase in the native 
mental power of the individuals who take part in it. 
These difficulties have recently been very concisely 
presented by Boas,t who concludes that races low in 
the scale may still have before them a future of develop- 
ment, and suggests certain methods for the study and 
determination of race characters. 
The turn of any race towards progress depends, like 
all other reactions between living things and their 
environment, upon a series of happy accidents. It must

360 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
be remembered that, as a rule, our latent capacities as 
individuals are far beyond our regular achievements, 
and that the stimuli which shall bring these powers into 
action may be of very different ‘sorts. An isolated 
race may apparently have progressed but little, when 
suddenly an earthquake, an invasion by a neighbour, or 
the birth of a more generously endowed member of the 
community, serves to give them an impulse which may 
not be exhausted for many generations. 
Striking indeed are the different ways in which such 
communities respond to the new influences brought to 
bear upon them from without, grappling at one and the 
same moment with novel activities, ideals, and diseases. 
Wallace, in all his journeyings through the Malay 
Archipelago, was impressed by the differences in the 
degree with which communities, apparently similar, 
responded to European influences. Thus. far, however, 
it has been impossible to state the anthropological 
peculiarities of those who have supported such a trial, 
as contrasted with the characters of those who have 
succumbed to it. Further, the question is still to be 
answered, whether the exercise of the nervous system 
demanded in highly civilised societies really causes an 
enlargement, as the exercise of glands and muscles can 
be shown to do. 
The comparison here suggested must be made with 
caution ; glands and muscles are of slow growth, in one 
sense of slower growth than the central system. They 
shrink when the body is starved, and expand when it is 
well nourished. .The central nervous system seems 
more stable, and starvation at least appears to produce 
little or no change in its bulk. Such powers of resist- 
ance probably have their shadow side, and the system 
which is thus but little affected in its bulk by unfavour- 
able conditions may be equally resistant to improve-
-P-A-G-E-361
  THE WIDER VIEW. 361 
ments in its environment, as represented by better 
exercise and more generous nourishment. 
It is a fair question to ask, though one hardly possible 
to answer, whether the best capacities of the best men 
have increased within historic times. We should hope 
that they had, and yet a demonstration is at present 
impossible. But if this is so, and if these exercises 
leave no structural modifications to the advantage of 
the next generation, what then is gained by painful 
study and mental gymnastics throughout a laborious 
lifetime ? 
The statement in this form, however, begs the 
question, for the enormous difficulty of measuring 
differences of human faculty makes it quite impossible 
for us to record slight changes, thus leaving the question 
really in the balance. In forming an opinion, the fact 
should not be lost from sight that education by rational 
methods and applied on a large scale is a very modern 
achievement. Results, too, may be attained quite aside 
from increase in the number of the nerve cells or 
marked alterations in their size. 
The individual stands related to the world of ideas 
about him as a race previously isolated does to the 
civilisation brought to it from without. In some cases 
such a race may in a few years assume the culture of its 
visitors, yet it can hardly be supposed: that this is 
accompanied by corresponding anatomical changes on 
the part of the imitators. It is rather that they find in 
their visitors a new stimulus, a variation in their 
surrounding conditions able to excite latent powers 
which are at that time prepared to be aroused. In the 
same way the education of one generation forms a 
more favourable environment for those in the next, and 
so the efforts of those who precede return to the 
advantage of those who follow. The possibility, how-

  ever, of this utilisation of previous exertion exists only 
where the machinery of civilisation is developed, for the 
advantages which the descendants enjoy are mainly 
expressed by relief from unnecessary and wasteful toil 
and life in a more invigorating atmosphere. 
The effective power of a community, depending as it 
does upon the subdivision of the labour within it; 
and the mutual dependence of one part on the others, 
and its trust in them, alone renders it possible for 
any group of individuals to attend to its own affairs 
with the necessary freedom from distraction. In- 
dividualism, in the biological sense of self-sufficiency, is 
the one necessary condition for uwuxczvilised existence, 
and so long as each member of the community is 
concerned with the preparation for all emergencies, just 
so long is he debarred from advance. 
If in any science a student were called upon to 
develop his subject in theory and technique from the 
very beginning there is no doubt that such a one 
would acquire much useful mental exercise, but the 
body of fact that to-day forms each branch of know- 
ledge, and which furnishes ever-increasing data upon 
which the logic of succeeding generations is to be 
exercised, this body of fact, the stored efforts of 
preceding workers, would be largely lacking, and we 
should be limited to just so much of science as could 
be obtained by one man in a long lifetime. 
The degree of interdependence is in some sense a 
measure of the degree of civilisation, but because it has 
proved marvellously useful to store in an available form 
the results of the activity of our predecessors, it by no 
means follows that by this act our own mental powers 
have attained a greater vigour or a broader span. As 
well measure the diligence of two farmers by the size of 
their crops, when one has planted good seed in fertile
-P-A-G-E-363
  THE WIDER VIEW. 363 
land, and the other poor seed in arid soil, as measure 
the mental activities of the members of two communities 
by the actual contributions of these communities to 
knowledge, without taking into account the background 
of their respective cultures. 
To be sure, the logical processes of the civilised man 
seem to count for more to-day than in the past, yet the 
first forms of tools, weapons, and the arts were no paltry 
achievements, and a discovery as epoch-making as the 
potter’s wheel, the saw, or the bow would be an enviable 
distinction for any man, however recent was his birth. 
Yet by our common measure these great inventors were 
all uncivilised. 
In comparing, therefore, remote times with the 
present, or in our own age races which have reached 
distinction with those which have remained obscure, it is 
by no means clear that the grade of civilisation attained 
is associated with a corresponding enlargement in the 
nervous system, or with an increase in the mental 
capabilities of the best representatives of these 
communities. Certainly the members of the com- 
munity at large find themselves surrounded by condi- 
tions which favour mental growth just as they are 
surrounded by conditions which protect them from 
accident and from disease ; but length of human life 
has not thereby been increased. Eighty or more years 
is long to live, as it always has been since historic time 
began, and that more men live out their allotted days in 
these later centuries, is due rather to a change in the 
conditions which surround them than to any alteration 
in their natural powers. Thus our generation makes 
great marches into the unknown; enabled to do this, 
not so much because the living are a superior race, but 
because civilisation has, as it were, constructed military 
roads throughout the country, and thus the “going” is
-P-A-G-E-364
  364 THE GROWTH OF THE BRAIN. 
easier. The physiological hindrance to increase of 
function seems to lie in the difficulty of effecting a 
recognition by the nervous system of the stimuli that 
act upon it. The world about us is not so different for 
those in the same community, yet how unlike are the re- 
sponses! Further, when an individual more perfectly 
constituted has been penetrated by some new sensation, 
how efficient such a one becomes in awakening in his 
neighbours similar responses, and thus putting into the 
possession of the community at large that which was 
previously the experience of one alone! 
Herein lies the significance of those members of 
society who deviate from the average of their fellows : 
these deviations are in all directions,—conservative and 
destructive,—and while not both have an equal chance 
of perpetuity, they both have great power to modify 
communal life. 
To-day, as in the past, it is permitted to a member of 
the great majority to grasp only a fragment of the 
knowledge of his time, with a suggestion of its past 
connections and something of its present bearing, and 
to illumine this with so much of foresight as a parsi- 
monious fate has meted out to him. To improve these 
powers the effort must be made in that direction where 
response is most ready, and so the formation of habit 
and reduction of mental friction, by means of concen- 
tration, must ever remain the chief objects of a formal 
training. 
Wider knowledge makes us accessible to a larger 
number of ideas, but it is a preparation for occasional 
stimuli, rather than for the continuous difficulties, while 
the manner of reaction, the control and method of per- 
formance, are the means by which the welfare of a 
community at large is most directly influenced through 
educational endeavour.
-P-A-G-E-365
  THE WIDER VIEW. 365 
The records of enthusiasts indicate that from time to 
time the hope has been entertained that through formal 
education much benefit would come to all, and funda- 
mental changes be wrought in man himself. No one 
questions the good which has followed from this effort, 
but how far the human organism has been modified by 
the experience is the doubtful point. Knowledge comes, 
for the hindrances to knowledge are in a large measure 
from without, but wisdom, as heretofore, continues to 
linger, and still to occupy its place as the rare per- 
formance of a balanced brain. We feel, though it 
must be granted that it is a feeling merely, that the 
descendant of several generations of educated ancestors 
should have a nervous system favourably modified, 
more vigorous, more responsive, more accurate in its 
reactions, and growing, perhaps, for a longer time, thus 
extending the period of its adaptability. But for this 
the evidence must still be sought. 
As an aid in the solution of these problems, I have 
endeavoured to combine the various observations on the 
changes in the form and functions of the brain during 
its time of growth, believing that a closer study of these 
changes will undoubtedly assist us, and that along this 
line the anatomist and the psychologist can bring 
together their accumulated facts for the benefit of all.

Balzac’s successes and failures, and the causes of these successes and 
failures, and of the scope of his genius.” —Scottish Leader. 
Life of Charlotte Bronté. By A. Birrell. 
‘« Those who know much of Charlotte Bronté will learn more, and those 
who know nothing about her will find all that is best worth learning in 
Mr. Birrell’s pleasant book.” —S¢. James's Gazette. 
Life of Browning. By William Sharp. 
“This little volume is a model of excellent English, and in every respec 
it seems to us what a biography should be.”—Pzblic Opinion.

Life of Bunyan. By Canon Venables.

and comprehensible portrait of the poet ever drawn with pen and ink,”— 
Manchester Examiner.

“This is an admirable book. Nothing could be more felicitous and 
fairer than the way in which he takes us through Carlyle’s life and works.” 
—Pall Mall Gazette. 
Life of Cervantes. By H. E. Watts. 
«Let us rather say that no volume of this series, nor, so far as we can 
recollect, of any of the other numerous similar series, presents the facts of

“* Notwithstanding the mass of matter that has been printed relating to 
Dickens and his works, . . . we should, until we came across this volume,

popular novelist as being really satisfactory. The difficulty is removed by 
Mr. Marzials’ little book.” —Atheneum.

  Life of Emerson. By Richard Garnett, LL.D.

Garnett’s.”—Saturday Review.

moment in which we write, is known or conjectured about the life of 
the great poet.” —Saturday Review.

original.” —Manchester Guardian. 
| 
Life of Arthur Schopenhauer. By William Wallace. —

-P-A-G-E-381
  Life of Sheridan. By Lloyd Sanders. 
“*To say that Mr. Lloyd Sanders, in this volume, has produced the 
best existing memoir of Sheridan is really to award much fainter praise 
than the book deserves.” — Manchester Guardian.

practical knowledge of the stage of Sheridan’s day.” —Saturday Review.

of the English novel.” Saturday Review.

Asa specialist on the history of the eighteenth century navy, he is at a 
great advantage in handling works so full of the sea and sailors as 
Smollett’s three principal novels. Moreover, he has a complete acquaint- 
ance with the Spanish romancers, from whom Smollett drew so much of 
his inspiration. His criticism is generally acute and discriminating; and 
his narrative is well arranged, compact, and accurate.”—S¢. /James’s

trated. Fourth and Revised Edition.

[Mr. Hobson’s] personal sympathies.”— Pal? Mall Gazette.

“We seem at last to be shown men and women as they are ; and at first it 
ts more than we can endure. . . . All Ibsen’s characters speak and act as if 
they were hypnotised, and under their creator’s imperious demand to reveal 
themselves, There never was such a mirror held up to nature before: it is 
too terrible, .. . Yet we must return to Ibsen, with his remorseless surgery, 
his remorseless electric-light, until we, too, have grown strong and learned to 
Jace the naked—if necessary, the flayed and bleeding—reality.” —SPEAKER

  REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
DrparTMENT or THE INTERIOR, 
Bureau or Epucation, 
Washington, October 1, 1910. 
Sm: It is generally understood that we have in this country no 
national system of school administration. The primary responsi- 
bility for educational control rests with the several States. No one, 
I am sure, would seriously propose that the States be relieved of this 
responsibility or of the powers which accompany it. But the nation 
can not be indifferent to that which forms the character of its citi- 
zens, upon which every national hope and aspiration depends. While 
we have no national system of schools, we have a national programme 
of education. This programme, in the nature of the case, must grow 
with our national growth; and every enlargement of our national 
power, resources, aims, and influence calls for a reexamination of our 
educational establishment to see whether it is keeping pace with the 
new requirements. 
The annual reports of the Commissioner of Education are in effect 
a running account of the progress made by the nation in the carrying 
out of this educational programme. But our aims become more defi- 
nite as they are brought nearer to realization. So these reports are 
equally a record of the progressive definition of our programme. 
While we seem to have gone forward rapidly in both the understand- 
ing and the performance of the work we have to do, it is pretty well 
agreed that in many particulars we are still laggard. This annual: 
record of movements and events should not only clarify our aims, but 
should concentrate attention upon those points where special endeav- 
ors are most needed. : 
AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATION. 
In this introductory chapter of my report for the year 1910, ac- 
cordingly, a new attempt will be made to set forth some of the main 
features of the American educational programme and to point out 
some of the places at which there is need of improvement. 
59041°—xp 1910—vor 1——1  
-P-A-G-E-10
EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
  Our educational organization, answering as it does to our federal 
plan of government, presents peculiar advantages as regards the 
making of a varied, flexible, yet inherently unified system of instruc- 
tion. It is an organization not readily understood by foreigners. It 
offers many obstacles to the carrying out of any plans for rapid and 
uniform improvement. Yet the self-governing character of its sev- 
eral members is of itself an incalculable advantage. Whatever unity 
is attained must be an inner unity, an agreement through conviction. 
There are a thousand forces working for unity and capable of giving 
us all of the unity that we need. To bring those forces to their finest 
influence, to do generously and effectively the things which under our 
form of organization may rightly be done, and by so doing to main- 
tain through all the changes of history that national character which 
is to make us a unit of concentrated and uplifting influence among 
the nations—this is, in part, the work of American education. 
Stated in the briefest terms, the essential elements of our educa- 
tional organization are the following: First, the school and university 
systems of the several States; secondly, the same state systems as 
united in free cooperation in matters of common educational interest ; 
thirdly, the provision made by the Federal Government for the en- 
couragement and furtherance of education under these state systems. 
Such provision by the Federal Government has taken three forms: 
The granting of public lands for education in the several States, 
beginning shortly before the adoption of the Federal Constitution 
and culminating in the grants for agricultural and mechanical col- 
leges in 1862; the establishment, in 1867, of the Federal Education 
Office, which aids the States by its information service and furthers 
their cooperation; and, finally, the distribution of federal funds, un- 
der the oversight of the Bureau of Education, in aid of agricultural 
and mechanical colleges in all of the States, under the acts of 1890 
and 1907. 
Other facts necessary to the most general understanding of our 
national organization of education are the following: That our pub- 
lic systems, which form the backbone of the educational provision 
in all of the States, are freely supplemented by institutions privately 
supported and privately managed; that we have been working out 
a peculiarly close integration of the several grades of education, 
elementary, secondary, and higher; and that historically our educa- 
tion is in the main liberal and general in its character, instruction of 
a technical and professional sort being an offshoot from this central 
trunk. 5 
If we add that in our educational activity we have shown ourselves 
hospitable in a marked degree to experiments, to incidental develop- 
ments, and to all manner of popular extensions of the field of educa- 
tion, we have a fairly comprehensive statement of what American 
 
-P-A-G-E-11
    
THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION, 3 
education has been and is endeavoring to be. The following para- 
graphs of this introduction will deal with certain of the newer 
aspects of the programme outlined above, while the succeeding chap- 
ters of this volume and the statistical tables and miscellaneous matter 
to be presented later in its companion volume will give a more de- 
tailed view of the present situation, with particular reference to 
occurrences and movements of the past twelve to fifteen months. 
THE BUREAU OF EDUCATION. 
1. Inasmuch as the office occupies a position central, in a measure, 
to the whole problem and movement, it is fitting that some statement 
should be made at this point concerning the recent history of the 
Bureau of Education. We are here concerned simply with what has 
been done toward rendering this office better able to perform its part 
in carrying out our national programme. 
The most marked advance of the past year in the work of the 
bureau appears in the employment of specialists in certain educational 
subjects, with particular reference to the work of those specialists 
“in the field.” This office has long been provided with specialists in 
foreign educational systems. It has been seen that the employment, 
also, of competent specialists in various branches of American edu- 
cation would be necessary if it is to do its proper work. More and 
more it becomes clear that the activity of such specialists, both in the 
collection and in the diffusion of information, can best be accom- 
plished through visits to educational institutions, offices, and conven- 
tions in different parts of the country. During the past year two 
men have been employed in such capacity, namely, Dr. Harlan Upde- 
graff, as specialist in school administration (under the statutory 
designation of collector and compiler of statistics), and Mr. Arthur 
C. Monahan, as specialist in land-grant college statistics. Congress 
has further provided for a specialist in higher education, a position 
which will undoubtedly be filled in the near future.* 
The work of the specialists in higher education and in land-grant 
college statistics will be mentioned later. (See pp. 9-10.) The special- 
ist in school administration will give attention particularly to service 
in the interest, first, of the several state offices of education, and, 
secondly, of the offices of our city school systems. This work has 
already become of so great importance that a separate division has 
been erected in the Bureau of Education to deal with such matters, 
the specialist in school administration being designated as chief of 
that division. ; 
The method of dealing with the work of this office which has 
been indicated above, has been received with evident approval in   
Since the above was put into type the position referred to has been filled by the 
appointment of Dr. Kendric Charles Babcock, for the past seven years president of the 
University of Arizona.  
-P-A-G-E-12
  4 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
all parts of the country. Information has come to this office of a 
concerted effort on the part of many of our educational leaders to 
secure provision for carrying this plan into full operation. The 
step proposed would involve the employment of at least ten addi- 
tional specialists, with provision for travel, publication, and other 
incidental expenses, involving an initial expenditure of $75,000 an- 
nually. In the estimates which I have submitted for the next fiscal 
year I have included this amount, distributed over the items indicated. 
The addition of even so modest a sum to the current appropriations 
would enable this office to make a fair beginning, though only a 
beginning, on the larger work which is now called for. 
In my report for the year 1909 (p. 28), mention was made of the 
removal of the bureau to fairly commodious and convenient quarters 
in one of the large government buildings. The rearrangement of 
the library in these new quarters has made it a more serviceable 
instrument for the work of the office. The organization of a new 
corps of specialists and field agents renders the library more than 
ever a useful and indispensable part of the office equipment, par- 
ticularly that large part of the collection which is made up of official 
documents, American and foreign. The library becomes a source of 
wide and accurate information on .which the newly appointed 
specialists may lean with confidence. 
Equally important for the success of the new undertakings is the 
publication service, through which the corps of specialists may gain 
the widest hearing for whatever of value they may have to present. 
This branch of the office has been strengthened by the addition of 
Mr. Milo B. Hillegas as editor. Mr. Hillegas has now become the head 
of the reorganized editorial division. Under his direction various 
changes are to be made with a view to rendering the publications 
of the office more immediately and generally useful. 
William Torrey Harris, former Commissioner of Education, died 
at Providence, R. I., November 5, 1909. He was the fourth incum- 
bent of the office, in which his term of service was the longest hith- 
erto, extending to nearly seventeen years, from September, 1889, to 
June, 1906. The personal distinction which he brought to the office 
and the extraordinary service which he rendered in this position 
would call for extended notice were it not that eulogy of former 
officials has been held to be out of place in a governmental report. 
Appreciative reviews of Doctor Harris’s life have appeared in 
numerous publications. <A selected list of such articles is appended 
to this chapter. (See p. 25.) 
HIGHER EDUCATION. 
2. Proceeding to a consideration of recent developments touching 
our educational programme in its several branches and divisions, we 
come first to our institutions of higher education.

  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. 5 
The lively discussion of college and university problems, which 
was so conspicuous a feature of the preceding year, was carried 
over into the earlier months of the year just closed. It showed our 
higher education as rounding a turn in the road. Every year, to be 
sure, in any living institution is a time of transition, but there can 
be little doubt that a turn of unusual importance has been taken 
here, and that the most of our higher institutions are affected by it. 
The talk has undoubtedly gone further than the turn. We see, 
indeed, more clearly what we are turning from than what we are 
turning toward. President Lowell recently remarked that “ the 
fact is we know very little about higher education. The whole sub- 
ject is one that needs to be scientifically studied, and as yet it has 
received very little attention of that kind.” But while this dis- 
cussion has thrown much of our scholastic tradition into the melting 
pot, the process of remolding is going on. It lacks as yet in clear 
conviction as to the changes which should be made. It can hardly 
be said that the assured and convincing leadership which is called 
for has yet appeared. There is need of more analytic study of the 
facts concerning our higher ‘institutions, their endeavors and their 
performance, and still more need of constructive interpretation of 
those facts. I am confident, however, that the colleges and uni- 
versities are making some progress toward finding themselves on the 
new track. 
A few of the developments of the past year may be mentioned. 
They offer, here and there, some ground for the confidence which has 
been expressed : 
An effort to make higher education more coherent has brought the 
subject of college electives into prominence. The discussions that 
prevailed during the earlier part of the year have been followed by 
action in several institutions. In his annual report to the trustees 
of Tufts College for the year 1909-10 President Frederick W. Ham- 
ilton says: 
I believe * * * that it is quite possible to do much to counteract the evil 
effects of the elective system upon the arts course in Tufts College without sacri- 
ficing the important principle whose recognition led to the establishment of the 
elective system. * * * Plans are now being prepared for a reorganization 
of our bachelor of arts courses which it is hoped to put into effect with the 
beginning of the fall term of 1910. 
The faculty of arts and sciences of Harvard University has adopted 
new rules for the choice of electives. All the subjects taught in col- 
lege are classified among four groups. A student must take some- 
thing in each group, and at least six courses in one department or in 
one recognized field for distinction. With reference to this change 
President Lowell says: 
No one would claim that the new system is perfect. No doubt it can be, and 
will be, greatly modified and improved by experience. * * * It is an attempt 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  6 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
to construct a positive system of education upon definite principles, and a sys- 
tem that is well fitted to the traditions of Harvard College, because it leaves the 
initiative with the student himself. * * * The essence of the system is that 
it holds up before a student a positive standard of education, and the setting-up 
of that standard alone is of inestimable value. 
The democratic movement in higher education has taken definite 
form in several important administrative changes. In October, 1909, 
the College of the City of New York entered upon a series of night 
sessions. Speaking of the character of the students, Dr. Stephen 
Pierce Duggan, director of the evening sessions, says “ their experience 
in life gave them a consciousness of the need of education that could 
not be expected of the day students.” Columbia University has 
reorganized its extension service, providing classes and laboratory 
work at the university during the evening and classes at various 
places in the adjacent country during the day. Fresno, Cal., is the 
first city to make provision for the two-year postgraduate high- 
school course recently authorized by the legislature of that State. It 
will aim “to carry students through the first two years of college or 
university work.” : 
One of the noteworthy efforts to bring the higher education into 
closer relations with the industries has been the establishment of ten 
fellowships in industrial chemistry in the University of Kansas. The 
latest university catalogue declares that “the university believes the 
best training for an industrial chemist is pure chemistry. * * * 
It will accept from corporations or individuals of business standing 
and integrity fellowships for the solution of industrial problems of 
public importance.” 
Unusual interest attaches to the provision which has been made in 
several Commonwealths for uniting those higher institutions which 
are directly controlled by the State, under a single state board of 
control. The advantages in the way of economy and harmonious 
management which such a scheme presents are obvious. 
The constitution of South Dakota, as also that of Montana, places 
all state institutions under the control of a single state board. Min- 
nesota erected a state board of control of public institutions in 1901. 
A Florida statute of 1905 concentrated the several state institutions 
of learning then in operation under a single board of control. This 
board, an appointive body, was made subject to the state board of 
education, which is a constitutional body, consisting of five of the 
principal officers of the political administration of the State, ex 
officio. This act has come into general notice because of a controversy 
regarding the respective powers of the board of control and the board 
of education. 
West Virginia, in February, 1909, provided for the concentration 
of the educational management of the state university and state 
normal school and their branches, and two institutes for colored 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. + 
students, under a state board of regents, subject to the financial 
oversight of a state board of control. The board of regents consists 
of four appointed members, receiving an annual salary of $1,000 
each, and the state superintendent of free schools, ex officio. The 
board of control consists of three members, receiving an annual 
salary of $5,000 each. This board of control is charged with the ad- 
ditional duty of managing the state penitentiary, and various state 
schools and hospitals. 
A month later Iowa concentrated the administration of its state 
university, college of agriculture and mechanic arts, and normal 
school, under a single state board of education of nine members, with 
the provision that “ not more than five of the members shall be of the 
same political party,” and “ not more than three alumni of the above 
"institutions, and but one alumnus from each institution may be mem- 
bers of this board at one time.” This board appoints a finance com- 
mittee of three members, also bipartisan, from outside of its own mem- 
bership. Members of the state board receive a per diem and traveling 
expenses. Members of the finance committee receive each an annual 
salary of $3,500 and mileage, and devote their whole time to the duties 
of the office. Both the West Virginia act and that of Iowa went into 
effect on the 1st day of July, 1909, and have accordingly had their 
first trial during the past academic year. 
Mississippi has followed, with an act of April 14, 1910, placing the 
administration of the University of Mississippi and three other state 
educational institutions under the sole supervision and control of one 
board of trustees. This board, appointed by the governor, with the 
approval of the state senate, consists of seven members, “ one of whom 
shall be a practical farmer, one a practicing lawyer, one a practical 
builder or architect or factory man.” One additional trustee is ap- 
pointed for the university. The members of this board receive a per 
diem and mileage, their service beginning with the 1st day of July, 
1910. 
This movement toward a unification of state institutions of higher 
education must be regarded as one of large significance. Attention 
should be called, on the other hand, to one grave danger against which 
the States should be on guard in making any such adjustment. The 
ability of a higher institution of learning to serve the State depends 
upon its ability to maintain an honorable standing in the world of 
science and the arts. Any provision which should hamper it as re- 
gards the getting of first-rate men for its teaching body and first-rate 
students for its student body is to be avoided, if the institution in 
question is to have the continued respect and confidence of the State 
and continue to be an effective servant of the State. 
The centering of public interest upon our state universities and their 
relations with other educational institutions is one indication of a
-P-A-G-E-16
  
  8 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
genuinely democratic movement in our higher instruction. Ezra 
Cornell proposed to establish “an institution where any person can 
find instruction in any study.” President Van Hise has gone further, 
in declaring that: “So far as the University of Wisconsin is con- 
cerned we propose to take up any line of educational work within the 
State for which the university is the best fitted instrument.” And he 
adds, “ It is my ideal of a state university that it should be a beneficent 
influence to every citizen of the State.” 
One provision of great interest has been made in the State of 
Massachusetts to meet the wider need of collegiate instruction, 
through an institution which is private in form but closely connected 
with the public educational system. The Massachusetts College was 
incorporated in February, 1910, on the initiative of prominent citi- 
zens of that State and with the approval of the reorganized state 
board of education. It contemplates the giving of instruction of col- 
legiate grade wherever it may be in demand throughout the State, 
using for that purpose on occasion public school buildings and the 
buildings of the state normal schools. Requirements for admission, 
courses of instruction, and the granting of degrees in this unique col- 
lege are all to be subject to the approval of a committee on degrees, 
not otherwise connected with the college, and appointed for the pur- 
pose by a board of advisers representing the other institutions of 
higher learning in the State. 
In an important sense, the work of higher education the country 
over is one great national undertaking, the prosecution of which is 
divided out among many institutions. By it our place in the world’s 
civilization and our prestige before the more enlightened of our sister 
nations is largely determined. But in making secure our standing in 
the opinion of mankind, it has more tangible and immediate benefits 
to render to our people in their life at home. It is a patriotic duty 
of the highest order that our colleges and universities, in all of the 
States, should get away from the more injurious forms of competition 
and enter into more effective cooperation. 
An agreement among the colleges with respect to admission require- 
ments, which should do away with minor differences that harass the 
preparatory schools, would rid the educational situation of some of its 
most serious embarrassments. There is a great deal of possible 
division of labor, particularly as regards instruction and research 
in graduate schools, which is not yet realized. There is much to be 
done in the way of a general survey of our present provision for ad- 
vanced instruction, with a view to determining where immediate 
enlargement is needed. The excessive variations in the worth of our 
academic and professional degrees is still a cause of reproach to us 
abroad and involves much of injustice as among our people at home.
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. 9 
The correction of these evils and weaknesses is in the main the work 
ef the higher institutions themselves, for the highest must always 
make their own standards. The private foundations that have of late 
set forward so forcefully the standardization of colleges and schools, 
are a conspicuous illustration of that free interaction of public and 
private agencies which is a characteristic of the American plan. Yet 
these foundations will undoubtedly do some of their best service in 
awakening a public sentiment which shall eventually lead to public 
action. And when public action shall be taken in any of these impor- 
tant matters it will generally come to its best by proceeding in har- 
mony with the best progressive opinion of the universities themselves. 
These considerations accentuate the importance of a unification of 
university opinion on university questions which are of general con- 
cern. Such shaping of university opinion should proceed on the 
basis of thorough-going cooperative studies of the questions at issue. 
There are several national organizations in which the representatives 
of colleges and universities meet together from time to time. Con- 
spicuous among these are the Association of American Universities, 
which held its eleventh annual conference at Madison, Wis., in Janu- 
ary last, and the National Association of State Universities, which 
enjoyed last year the hospitality of Harvard University, meeting in 
the faculty room at Cambridge shortly after President Lowell’s 
inauguration. These two organizations have both concerned them- 
selves with the making of a working definition of a university. While 
the two definitions proposed are not in full agreement, they are not 
far apart. It is greatly to be desired that the two bodies should come 
to a common understanding in this matter. By so doing they can 
set up a standard which will give direction to the uncertain endeavors 
of many institutions and will give to our scholastic degrees in widely 
scattered institutions some ascertainable meaning. 
There is no national association of colleges, of scope and character 
corresponding to that of the university associations.mentioned above. 
This fact alone shows something of the separatism which has charac- 
terized our institutions of this type. It is a thing to be desired that 
American colleges should get together and recognize their work as a 
common and national work, as American universities have begun 
to do. 
It will be no small part of the work of the specialist in higher edu- 
cation who is to be employed in the Bureau of Education to collect 
and give out information concerning matters which are of common 
interest to our colleges and universities. When his work is fully 
organized, it should facilitate the closer study of the problems of 
higher education and the cooperation of widely scattered institutions 
in the national service which they are to render. More specifically,  
-P-A-G-E-18
  10 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
he will have to do with the improvement of the statistics and account- 
ing of these institutions, and with those improvements in administra- 
tion to which statistics and accounting are tributary; with the record- 
ing and reporting of such information concerning academic and 
professional standards as may be required in answer to inquiries at 
home and abroad; with the indexing of current graduate studies in 
this country, to the end of furthering cooperation among our gradu- 
ate schools; and with a variety of special studies, publication, and 
other service which may be found useful and practicable. 
Closely related to the duties of the specialist in higher education 
are those of the specialist in the work of the land-grant colleges. The 
notable group of institutions for higher instruction in agriculture and 
the mechanic arts which has been built up in this country under the 
direct encouragement of the Federal Government has begun to em- 
phasize the national unity of their work through the Association 
of American Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations. An 
important outgrowth of that organization is the Graduate School of 
Agriculture, which meets from time to time for a summer session at 
some selected institution. A freer and more rapid diffusion, among 
the members of this group, of information concerning improvements 
in any one of them which might be the seed of improvement in others, 
would add much to the sum total of their contribution to the general 
welfare. I am convinced that there are much larger services to be 
rendered by some of these institutions than have hitherto been possi- 
ble. The Nelson amendment, for example, with its provision that a 
portion of the new funds may be used in the training of industrial 
teachers, opens up ways in which they can greatly serve the States 
in which they are severally situated and the nation at large. The 
best efforts of the newly appointed land-grant college specialist will 
be devoted to this cause. 
The land-grant colleges have been active during the past year in 
establishing and improving their facilities for the preparation of 
teachers of agriculture and the mechanic arts, and in establishing and 
developing their departments for extension work. Thirty colleges 
out of 52 are now giving special instruction in preparation for teach- 
ing; 19 have organized departments of agricultural or industrial edu- 
cation and are giving instruction in pedagogical subjects as well as 
in agriculture and the industries; 30 are conducting summer schools 
primarily for public-school teachers, where they may receive instruc- 
tion in agriculture and agricultural teaching; and 40 have depart- 
ments equipped for extension work. 
The agricultural extension movement was stimulated by the action 
of the Association of American Agricultural Colleges and Experi- 
ment Stations at its annual meeting held in Portland, Oreg., in 
August, 1909, when an amendment to its constitution was adopted,
-P-A-G-E-19
  
THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. 11 
admitting a “ section on extension work ” upon equality with the two 
sections then in existence. The experiment stations, since their estab- 
lishment in 1887, have accumulated a mass of practical and scientific 
information concerning agriculture, which the colleges now propose 
to bring to the farming population in usable form. By movable 
schools and farmers’ institutes the teachers of agriculture and the ex- 
periment station investigators are coming into direct contact with 
these people and the contact is of mutual benefit. The new provision 
for traveling specialists in the States of Idaho and Georgia is a 
conspicuous example. 
College departments of education and of agricultural extension are 
joined in a cooperative movement for the betterment of the rural 
schools. To this end, in addition to the summer schools already 
mentioned, the colleges in some of the States, notably Florida, Kan- 
sas, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, are offering correspondence 
courses for teachers, and several have established departments of 
rural education under the charge of an instructor who directs and 
gives advice in all matters relating to the teaching of agriculture and 
allied sciences in the schools. Such provision in the States of Florida, 
Kansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and South Carolina may be men- | 
tioned. 
STATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
8. The fourth conference of state superintendents of public in- 
struction with representatives of the Bureau of Education, was held 
at Indianapolis, on the 3d of March, 1910, the subject for discussion — 
being “ Desirable uniformity and desirable. diversity in the educa- 
tional legislation of the several States.” Eighteen States were repre- 
sented at this meeting, fifteen of them by their chief education officers. 
The third conference of this series, held at Denver, July 8, 1909, was 
mentioned in my annual report for 1909 (p. 65). 
The spirit of state cooperation has found expression more recently 
in a conference of the representatives of eight States of the Middle 
West, which was held at Lincoln, Nebr., May 31—June 1, 1910, to con- 
sider the special question of desirable uniformity in the licensing of 
teachers and in the interstate recognition of teachers’ certificates. 
This bureau was represented at the Lincoln conference by its specialist 
in school administration, who has undertaken, with the help of several 
state offices, the preparation of a general survey of the provision for 
the granting of teachers’ certificates in all of the States. This inquiry 
is of itself important; but more important is the growing disposition 
on the part of the States to enter into cooperative undertakings, where 
the educational system in each of them may be strengthened by the 
concurrent action of all. A conference for the further consideration 
of state uniformity and interstate comity in the matter of teachers’
-P-A-G-E-20
  12 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
| certificates will convene at Salt Lake City, on the 17th of November, 
| 1910. 
On the whole, the movements of the time are tending to strengthen 
the state education offices and to devolve upon them enlarged respon- 
sibilities. This is notably true of the various movements in the inter- 
est of industrial education. Individual state superintendents are 
accentuating this tendency by the positive leadership which they are 
contributing to a progressive educational programme in their re- 
spective States. The more frequent meeting together of representa- 
tives of the several state offices has quickened their activities. A 
striking example of such association was the tour of inspection of 
educational offices and institutions, and of certain cooperative enter- 
prises in rural life, made by a group of thirteen Southern State 
superintendents under the auspices of the Southern Education Board 
in October, 1909. This party visited the rural schools in Page 
County, Iowa; a district agricultural school and several typical 
cooperative creameries, cooperative elevators, and cooperative stores 
in the vicinity of St. Paul, Minn.; the Dunn County School of Agri- 
culture and Domestic Science, the Dunn County Training School for 
Teachers, and the Stout Institute and Manual Training School, at 
Menomonie, Wis.; the Winnebago County School of Agriculture and 
Domestic Science in Winneconne, Wis.; and the University of Wis- 
consin, at Madison. 
It is plain to see that the growing centralization of educational 
influence and educational administration in the States is raising new 
' problems touching the fundamental plan of state school organization. 
Reference has been made to the centering of public interest, in many 
of the States, upon the institutions of higher education, and particu- 
larly upon the state universities. These institutions have shown of 
late extraordinary power of appeal to the public imagination and to 
public confidence. In many of the States there is a growing disposi- 
tion to repose in the universities responsibility not only for scientific 
instruction and research, in matters vitally affecting the public wel- 
fare, but also for the administration of affairs to which the sciences 
are severally related. Now, the universities bear a threefold relation 
to affairs of public education. They are the crowning members 
of closely integrated educational systems; they send many of 
their graduates into the schools as superintendents and teachers; 
their departments of education investigate questions relating to edu- 
cational improvement, as their other scientific departments investi- 
gate other questions of public interest. These relations come to a 
focus in provision for the admission of high-school graduates to the 
colleges of the university, and in the highly organized systems of 
inspection of high schools which in many States have grown up with 
the admission of candidates on certificate.
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. 13 
Under these circumstances, the state education office, with its small 
staff serving under a superintendent whose tenure of office is rela- 
tively brief, even though backed up by statutes conferring consider- 
able powers, can not exert the consecutive and cumulative influence 
in the educational affairs of the State which the academic institution 
exercises. In some States there are other state institutions, having 
large power and prestige, which further complicate the situation. 
No State, I am sure, which has come to expect its schools to be 
guided and inspired by the highest academic influences will be con- 
tent to give up that advantage for a system of merely bureaucratic 
control. On the other hand, where administrative responsibilities 
come to crowd and interrupt the scholastic pursuits of university 
faculties, some relief must be found through a well-adjusted division 
of labor. In other words, a bureaucratic school administration, if 
such were erected, could not permanently satisfy any State, neither 
could an incidental administration by bodies organized for academic 
purposes be permanently satisfactory. It seems inevitable that these 
conditions, so rich in elements of the greatest significance for the 
civilization of a State, must lead to modifications in many of our 
state systems of school administration. Such modifications must, to 
all appearance, take the form of a better distribution of academic 
and administrative functions, together with a better coordination of 
those functions. 
Important school legislation has been enacted in several of the 
States during the past year, notably in New York, Ohio, and Vir- 
ginia. The reappointment of Doctor Draper as commissioner of 
education of the State of New York for an indefinite term, while not 
unexpected, was a significant event. The reorganization in that State 
of the whole system of local school supervision outside of cities prom- 
ises a large improvement in the efficiency of the rural schools. In 
Virginia the new state supervisors, of both white and colored rural 
schools, have made a most hopeful beginning, and such provision is 
extending to other Southern States. Massachusetts, Ohio, and Vir- 
ginia have strengthened their legal provisions touching the labor of 
children, and New Jersey its provisions relating to juvenile delin- 
quents. Virginia has brought about a coordination of several forms 
of agricultural extension through the establishment of an agricultural 
board. New York has provided for the pensioning of teachers in 
state institutions, without deductions from their salaries. The recast- 
ing, on large lines, of the state educational system of Massachusetts 
has gone steadily forward. These few notes will give some indication 
of the wholesome trend of current educational enactments and meas- 
ures of administration. A list of references to recent publications 
having to do with the organization of state educational systems is 
appended to this chapter (see p. 26).
-P-A-G-E-22
    14 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
The heaviest and most direct responsibility for educational per- 
formance is generally that which rests upon our city systems of 
schools; and there is no point where accurate and intelligible statis- 
tics are of more use in the improvement of educational practice. A 
committee on uniform statistics was appointed by the Department of 
Superintendence of the National Education Association at its meeting 
at Indianapolis in March, 1910. This committee concerns itself with 
city statistics as well as with those of the States and of minor areas 
of administration. When it comes to city systems, the superinten- 
dents’ committee meets with the activities of a still younger body, the 
National Association of School Accounting Officers, whose coopera- 
tion promises to be of the greatest value. 
A preliminary meeting for the organization of this association was 
held at Washington, in the office of the Commissioner of Education, 
the 16th and 17th of May, 1910. The new organization voted to 
include in its inquiries not only the financial side of the school ad- 
ministration, but also the wider range of city school statistics, in so 
far as they have a direct bearing upon the measurement of results. 
The Director of the Federal Census, as well as the Commissioner of 
Education and other representatives of both bureaus, participated 
in the discussions, along with others concerned in a more general 
way with the improvement of educational reports. The valuable 
cooperation of the Census Office in the endeavor to improve the fiscal 
reporting of the larger city systems was mentioned in my report for 
the year 1909 (p. 28). ‘ 
The Bureau of Education is in a position to serve as the pivot 
and focus of these simultaneous undertakings. The fact should not 
be disguised that, even with all of these forces operating concur- 
rently, the thoroughgoing reform of our statistical and accounting 
systems must proceed slowly. But I am now confident that within 
three or four years substantial progress will be visible under such 
cooperation, and that the improvement in statistics and reports will 
work toward very considerable improvements in education. This 
bureau will give its best efforts to the advancement of the under- 
taking by the shortest possible course. 
The year has shown the usual progress in the city school systems of 
the country. Interest here has centered upon such special activities 
as the open-air schools of Boston, New York, and Chicago, and the 
steady extension of medical inspection; the continued advance of the 
trade-school idea in New York, Philadelphia, and other cities; the 
combination of schooling and apprenticeship in Cincinnati, Fitch- 
burg, and Providence; arrangements for finding employment for 
graduates of the schools, as in Boston and Louisville; and the increas- 
ing attention paid to backward and otherwise exceptional children in 
special schools and classes,
-P-A-G-E-23
  
THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. 15 
The interest in provision for exceptional children in the schools 
was strikingly illustrated and furthered by the meeting of the de- 
partment of superintendence of the National Education Association 
at Indianapolis in March, 1910, the programme of which was almost 
wholly devoted to a consideration of various differences among chil- 
dren which should be reflected in the provision for instruction and 
training in the schools. 
Generally speaking, it may be said that moral training, industrial 
education, and education for health, are paramount concerns in the 
forward movement of this present time. The attention which they 
command is justified by immediate needs. They present intricate 
and difficult problems, and the contributions of any one year to the 
solution of those problems must be fragmentary at best. 
Among the recent landmarks in the literature of industrial educa- 
tion are the reports concerning trade schools presented respectively 
to the American Federation of Labor at its Toronto meeting in 
November, 1909, and to the National Association of Manufacturers 
at its New York meeting in May, 1910; the committee report adopted. 
by the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education 
at its Milwaukee meeting in December, 1909, calling for a general 
investigation of the subject, under federal authority; the report on 
conditions in the State of New York, prepared by Mr. Charles R. 
Richards and published in the twenty-sixth annual report of the New 
York bureau of labor statistics (1909) ; and the monograph on “ Edu- 
cation for efficiency in railroad service,” prepared by Mr. James Shir- 
ley Eaton and published in the bulletin of the Bureau of Education 
(1909). A valuable annotated bibliography is appended to Director 
Richard’s report. 
The Dolliver bill for the granting of rederal aid to the several 
States for the promotion of secondary instruction in agriculture and 
the mechanic arts was favorably reported from the Senate Committee 
on Agriculture and Forestry shortly before the close of the recent 
session of Congress. The Davis bill in the House, containing the 
same provisions, has not been reported. 
Two important contributions to the literature of education for 
health have been made during the year in the volume on “ Open-air 
schools ” by Dr. Leonard P. Ayres, of the Russell Sage Foundation 
(Doubleday, Page & Co., 1910, p. 17-++-171), and the series of articles 
in the American Physical Education Review (1909-10) by Prof. 
William H. Burnham on “ The hygiene of physical training.” 
SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
4. In different portions of the country the old-time controversy re- 
specting the relations of public high schools to colleges and univer- 
sities has been revived with more than its usual intensity. The  
-P-A-G-E-24
Se eee 
16 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
objections to conditions now obtaining where there is a state univer- 
sity admitting students on certificate, have been forcibly set forth by 
State Supt. C. P. Cary, of Wisconsin, in a communication to the 
board of university regents of that State. Superintendent Cary 
refers to the fact that his office is required by law to organize, inspect, 
and approve of high schools, and to grant state funds to those 
approved and withhold such aid from all others. He presents the 
following objections to the present arrangement: 
1. The present system is a double-headed one in which the state department 
finds it exceedingly difficult to perform in a satisfactory way the duties required 
of it by law. 
2. University inspection of high schools is often done by experts, each of 
whom wants his specialty to have the lion’s share. 
3. Educational affairs to-day, as relates to the course of study particularly, 
are in great ferment and a crisis is imminent. 
4. A university is essentially a conservative institution and yields to modern 
movements with great reluctance.   The case of an eastern high school, where there is no state university 
and students are more generally admitted to college on examination, 
was recently set forth as follows by Mr. John P. Cushing, head master 
of the New Haven High School: 
Some of our trouble in high schools in the past has arisen from the dictation 
from higher institutions. All of the well-known numerical commissions on one 
study or another havé been controlled by college men; and each committee has 
been impelled by the desires of its own specialists. These findings, in turn, 
have been handed over to the high schools for adoption. The result is that we 
have a mass of stuff, each subject arranged in due order by its own promoters, 
without much regard to the other subjects; and the result has brought about a 
decided overburdening of our courses, and the end is not yet. 
On the other hand, the New York Nation, commenting editorially 
in its issue of July 14, 1910, on some of the papers presented at the 
meeting of the National Education Association at Boston, said: 
Now, in simple truth, a great deal of the talk about colleges by such persons 
as those from whom we have quoted is merely rubbish, * * * The terrible 
hardship of differentiating between courses designed to be followed by a college 
training and those that are not rests, so far as we can see, upon the idea that a 
college has no rights that a true democrat is bound to respect. It may be that 
the objects which a college pursues are not worth pursuing; but so long as it 
does pursue them, it must of necessity demand, on the part of entering students, 
such preparation as is necessary for their attainment. 
On the subject of the injury done to secondary schools by the dominant part 
played by college-entrance examinations much might reasenably be said. The 
need of taking the examinations inte account does unquestionably hamper many 
an earnest and enthusiastic teacher, and prevents him from giving to his stu- 
dents all that he might zive through a freer play of his individuality. It is 
probable that ways and means might be found by colleges to lessen this evil. 
But the question to which these outbursts of hostility or contempt direct atten- 
tion is far deeper than this. They touch not college methods, but college aims. 
‘They challenge the underlying idea of college education.

7 THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. 1 
Still more recently, Dr. Marion LeRoy Burton, in his inaugural 
address as president of Smith College, spoke as follows: 
, Inregard to the matter of entrance requirements in America we have arrived at 
no entirely satisfactory solution. * * * If a method of entrance to college 
could be devised which would relieve the secondary schools of many of the 
deadening evils incident to the present system, * * * much would be accom- 
plished for our educational system as a whole. * * * Such far-reaching re- 
sults are probably to be found in the adoption of some form of the method of 
college entrance now in vogue in some institutions which is based almost en- 
tirely upon a personal knowledge of the student’s record, ability, and person- 
ality. Examinations and certificates are not to be discontinued, but they alone 
should neither admit nor exclude a student. 
One of the institutions to which Doctor Burton refers is undoubt- 
edly Columbia University. The Columbia plan was described by 
President Butler in an address before the Association of School- 
masters of New York and Vicinity in April, 1909, which closed with 
the following declaration: 
The introduction of the human element into the administration of college 
admission requirements and into the college admission examinations is the way 
out of our difficulties. In the creation of the committee whose existence and 
functions I have described, we at Columbia have done the best we know how 
to do toward accomplishing this end. (Educational Review, v. 38, p. 172, Sep- 
tember, 1909.) 
The high school indeed occupies a critical point, in the center of 
the field, and different fires converge upon it. This is in part the 
reason why the high school question is the one which reveals most 
clearly the change which, gradually and without observation, has 
been coming over our state systems of educational administration, 
and out of which more obvious and organic changes are undoubtedly 
to come. 
There are two considerations of a general character which are cen- 
tral to this whole problem: In the first place, it is not merely a de- 
mand of the universities, but a genuinely popular demand that our 
high schools should bridge the gap between the grammar schools and 
the colleges, offering to all pupils a well articulated series of educa- 
tional opportunities, from the lowest to the highest. In the second 
place, where the standards of secondary education are uncertain and 
fluctuating, the colleges must fix their own standards of admission or 
give up the hope of maintaining an honorable position in the academic 
world. 
The historic situation, in which our secondary schools have been 
held up to a creditable grade of excellence by the admission require- 
ments of the colleges has, then, been amply justified in the past. It 
is not yet outgrown. But every year it becomes more unsatisfactory, 
in spite of many incidental improvements made in the past genera- 
59041°—xp 1910—vor 1——2 
   
-P-A-G-E-26
18 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
tion; and we must now look forward to a time when it can be super- 
seded by some different arrangement, which shall be as good for the 
colleges and better for the schools. 
Now that a large part of the responsibility for college preparation 
falls to the public high schools, it is not to be forgotten that the col-* 
lege and university authorities, in prescribing their entrance require- 
ments, are in effect passing legislation for the control of public 
education. It is of the utmost importance that such quasi legislation 
should be based on a broad understanding of the position and needs 
of the secondary schools. Irritation naturally arises when high- 
school men discover or believe that this or that specific entrance 
requirement is the result of a compromise between rival departments 
of a given college or university, in which departmental aspirations 
rather than the essential requirements of secondary education have 
been the sole consideration; or when it is found that some other 
requirement insists upon the preparation of students for the pursuit 
of a given subject in college, when, under an elective system, great 
numbers of students never pursue that subject in college. 
What is really needed from the side of the colleges is chiefly this, 
that the high schools bring their students up to an intellectual stature 
and maturity fairly corresponding-to their age at high-school gradu- 
ation, with that combination of disciplines, intellectual, esthetic, and 
moral, which enables competent freshmen to lay hold upon a difficult 
scholastic undertaking and compel it to yield to them its goods. 
Wherever the high schools can be depended on to do this, the colleges 
may safely accept what such schools may send them, only guarding 
occasional courses by special examinations after the candidates shall 
have matriculated. Or, to adopt a more moderate and objective state- 
ment, whenever the high schools of a given area shall have reached 
a point where in the absence of entrance requirements they would 
send to college students as well trained and as mature as those they 
now send, then the colleges may fairly dispense with detailed en- 
trance requirements. ‘There might be added the proviso of a reason- 
able expectation that the quality of the candidates should continue to 
improve with a reasonable advance of college standards from year to 
year. It is doubtful whether the high schools of any State have as 
yet reached this general level. How could it be expected, indeed, 
when the attendance on high schools is increasing so rapidly and the 
demand for competent high-school teachers is growing with the 
growth of the supply? In the country at large we are undoubtedly 
far from any such consummation. 
The situation is one which calls for patience and continual readjust- 
ment on both sides. It is, moreover, on both sides beset with serious 
dangers.
-P-A-G-E-27
THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. 19 
As regards the universities, particularly those under public con- 
trol, there is the danger that in some States the irritation which 
arises over this question from time to time may result in unfavor- 
able legislation, limiting the power of the higher institutions to 
determine their own entrance requirements. This danger makes 
clear an obligation which rests equally upon all colleges and uni- 
versities, that they study objectively the needs of the schools and the 
effect of their own requirements upon the schools. There is no sub- 
ject, I think, which calls for more careful investigation by university 
methods, uninfluenced by concern for the narrower interests of the 
university as an institution, than does this subject of public second- 
ary education. And whatever the universities may do for the eleva- 
tion of the secondary schools by other ways than that of using their 
own entrance requirements as a lifting jack, is worthy of their 
thoughtful attention. 
The dangers of the situation as regards the high schools are no 
less acute. These schools are affected by forces pulling upon them, 
not only from the colleges above and the grammar schools below, but 
from the varied life of the communities which they serve. The 
new demands, which may be roughly grouped under industrial and 
commercial education, must give them anxious thought. There are 
those who fear that the high school as an institutional type may 
fall into disfavor unless it can readily adapt itself to the new needs 
of the time, as the Latin grammar school of colonial days declined 
before the rising academies, and less than a century later the acad- 
emy declined before the new popularity of the high schools. Hither 
a modified and broadened high school or a school of different type 
altogether may fairly be expected in time to dispute the preeminence 
of the high school as it is to-day. But the high school is still on a 
rising tide, and its possibilities of readjustment to new needs are 
very great. 
It can, indeed, command the present situation if it can bring 
together its forces on a strong, progressive programme. In many 
of the States the teaching force of the high schools, if they were agreed 
upon definite improvements touching their relations with the colleges, 
would be met with full and ungrudging acceptance of their proposals. 
It is a responsibility resting upon the general body of high-school 
teachers and accentuated by the highest considerations of public serv- 
ice and patriotism that they study the ways in which these schools 
can best serve the public good and make clear that the new courses 
and methods which they may propose are as sound and disciplinary 
and uplifting as the older alternatives. 
If the situation, on the whole, is one that calls for patience, it is 
not one that calls for inaction. There is need rather of active effort 
 
-P-A-G-E-28

20 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
toward improvement. Such effort may fairly have in view as its 
ultimate end, whether near or remote, a system of secondary educa- 
tion so well organized and conducted that it may be trusted to pre- 
pare students for entrance upon the higher education in the ordinary 
course of imparting a good secondary education, without close’ pre- 
scription from above of the subjects to be pursued and without the 
need of a separate test from above of each individual specimen of its 
product. It goes without saying that such a system of secondary 
education must have standards of its own, and reasonably high and 
constant standards. While much freedom for local variation is 
desirable, there must be back of it some generally recognized norms 
of excellence, which shall take account of all of the larger relations 
and responsibilities of high-school instruction. 
One illuminating passage in the year’s history of our secondary 
education was the controversy in the North Central Association of 
Colleges and Secondary Schools respecting the relation of the Chi- 
cago high schools to the accrediting board of that body. Much 
interest has been shown in the experiment now making in Berkeley, 
Cal., with a six-year high school following a six-year elementary 
school, and in the proposal by a committee of school men of a similar 
plan for the city of New York. Attention has been drawn also to new 
high-school buildings in several cities, as in Altoona, where unusually 
close relations have been established betwen the public schools and the 
shops of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and in Los Angeles, where an 
interesting group of buildings has been erected for the technical high 
school. 
A list of references to recent publications bearing on the relations 
betwen high schools and colleges is appended to this chapter (see 
p. 29).   
MARGINAL ACTIVITIES. 
5. There are many activities closely related to education which have 
received a large measure of attention in recent months. Libraries 
and museums, apprenticeship, public playgrounds, home-and-school 
associations—such interests as these are sometimes treated as lying 
just outside of the educational inclosure. There is, however, an un- 
_mistakable tendency to widen the inclosure, and to bring these 
things into some relation with the regular scholastic administration. 
There are, moreover, numerous undertakings which look to an 
extension of educational opportunities to those who have left school 
and have passed the age of compulsory schooling. Evening and 
other “ continuation ” schools, public lectures, correspondence courses, 
home studies of the Chautauqua type, are all familiar examples. 
Some of these things are distinctively American, and have helped to 
make our reputation for educational enterprise abroad. Others are
-P-A-G-E-29
  
THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION, 21 
better done in foreign countries than in our own, and we are learning 
from their experience. The thing to be noted here is the way these 
undertakings, even if privately managed at first, keep gravitating 
toward the main body of our educational system. 
Tt is well to look forward and see to what end such changes are 
tending. I have no doubt that we shall always have a variety of 
these marginal enterprises under private direction; pioneer work, 
largely, in fields that have not been fully explored. But the taking 
over of such activities into our public systems of education may 
lead to results which are seldom even imagined. 
It may bring us to a new interpretation of “ universal ” education, 
broader than that which fired the zeal of the advocates of common 
schools in the eighteenth and the early nineteenth century, and 
larger even than that indicated by the liberal utterance of Ezra 
Cornell; no less, indeed, than this, that modern States shall eventu- 
_ally see to it that any citizen of any age, who seeks instruction in 
any subject, shall find such instruction provided for him, according 
to his desires, his needs, and his ability to learn: not necessarily pro- 
vided in soft ways nor always at public expense, but made actually 
available by ways that are within his reach. The newer plans of the 
University of Wisconsin venture a long way in this direction. 
The new attention to playgrounds and play opens up another 
avenue of approach to this end; for play is closely connected with 
the educational interests of health, of free expression, and of music, 
the drama, and the dance, through which we come into the field of 
the fine arts. Moreover, those associations of parents and teachers 
which are accomplishing a great enlargement of the out-of-school 
uses of our public-school buildings bring work and play together in 
ways that are wholesome and interesting. 
The annual convention of the Playground Association of America, 
held at Rochester in June, 1909, laid a strong emphasis on such ideals 
as have been suggested above. This convention, held in a city which 
has been conspicuous for its leadership in these activities, was largely 
attended and made a deep impression upon those who witnessed the 
proceedings. 
SOME FUNDAMENTALS. ' 
6. It seems clear that the enlargement of the scope of public edu- 
cation, referred to above, is destined to go on indefinitely. Indeed, 
such a forward movement is not only inevitable, but desirable, repre- 
senting as it does one of the best tendencies of our democracy. The 
legal bearings of this movement were briefly set forth, as follows, 
in the opinion of the supreme court of Michigan in the Kalamazoo 
high-school case, in 1874: 
Neither in our state policy, in our constitution, or in our laws do we find the 
primary school districts restricted in the branches of knowledge which their
-P-A-G-E-30
  22 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
officers may cause to be taught or the grade of instruction that may be given 
if their voters consent in regular form to bear the expense and raise the taxes 
for the purpose. 
In these days the voters consent with all readiness to bear the ex- 
pense and raise the taxes for a great variety of these newer activities. 
While this attitude is to be applauded and the most of the newer 
activities are to be regarded as calling for unqualified support, there 
is occasion also for the strongest possible emphasis upon the old and 
basic needs of our educational establishment. There be three of 
those needs which occasion anxious thought; yea, four of them will 
have the attention of wise men in our generation: The need of good 
teachers, of good schoolhouses, of good school attendance for full 
terms of school, and—equally important under modern conditions— 
of adequate supervision. 
As regards all of these needs, it may be said that we have become 
so habituated to present conditions that we fail to see how discredita- 
ble some of them are to us as a nation and how unfair to many of 
our young citizens. 
The recent growth of our state normal schools and the spread of 
provision for the professional training of teachers in colleges and 
universities on the one hand, and in rural high schools on the other 
hand, is on the whole encouraging. Yet the circumstances attendant 
upon the teaching profession are still unsatisfactory, the member- 
ship of the teaching body is still too unstable, and the proportion of 
teachers who are equipped with professional training or adequate 
experience or both is still too low. Far-reaching improvements, 
much farther reaching than any that have recently been made, will 
be necessary to enable the teaching force of this country to measure 
up to the responsibilities with which it is charged. 
Our expenditures for school buildings excite the wonder of for- 
eign visitors, and many of the single buildings of this class in our 
towns and cities are undoubtedly among the best in the world. Yet, . 
on the other hand, money is often wasted on ornamentation which is 
not even ornamental, the sanitary condition of city schoolhouses is 
in many instances unsatisfactory, and in many country districts the 
schools are still wretchedly housed. A number of our state and city 
offices of education are laboring assiduously to remedy these defects, 
and progressive county superintendents, not a few, are rendering 
good service in the same direction. Many years ago this office put 
forth a circular of information (1891, No. 8, Sanitary conditions for 
schoolhouses, by Albert P. Marble), which has been widely useful in 
furthering improvement in schoolhouse construction, and is in de- 
mand to the present day. With a view to giving further stimulus 
and guidance to such improvement, I have had a bulletin prepared 
on schoolhouse construction. which is now in press and will appear in
-P-A-G-E-31
  
THE COMMISSIONER’S INTRODUCTION. 23 
the near future. (Bulletin, 1910, No. 5, American schoolhouses, by 
Fletcher B. Dresslar.) 
In my first report I called particular attention to the need of in- 
creased effort for the improvement of school attendance (see Report 
of the Commissioner of Education for 1905, p. xlix-l). The exten- 
sion of the area of compulsory school attendance has gone forward, 
but the number of young Americans who are allowed to grow up 
with only meager schooling is still distressingly large. Several inde- 
pendent statistical studies of school attendance in cities have been 
made within the past four years and considerable difference of opinion 
has appeared touching. the interpretation of the data at hand. Yet 
the curves of school attendance plotted by the several statisticians 
who have made these studies all show essentially the same form for 
the higher elementary or grammar grades, and all alike indicate a 
lamentable falling off in those grades. 
The subject of county and rural school supervision received special 
attention in my annual report for the year 1907 (p. 19-25). Some 
important advances have been made in this regard within the past 
three years. There is no form of public school improvement which 
shows good results more quickly and unmistakably than an improve- 
ment in supervision. I have been particularly impressed of late 
with the changes which have been made in this way in Vermont and 
other New England States, in which the supervision is by townships 
or unions of townships; and in Virginia and other southern States, 
in which a positive advance is led by agents attached directly to the 
office of the state superintendent of public instruction. The new law 
for school supervision in the State of New York is also full of prom- 
ise. Yet there is much more to be done, and many other forms of 
betterment are waiting upon better provision for supervisory 
activities. 
There are many educational organizations outside of the teaching 
profession which are carrying on a propaganda in behalf of better 
schools for our people. The attention of such organizations and of 
our citizens generally is called with all urgency to the four things of 
fundamental concern which have been mentioned in these later para- 
graphs. A long and hard campaign will be required to bring our 
American education up to what it should be in these particulars, with 
due regard for our prestige abroad and for the general welfare at 
home. 
The topics touched upon in this introduction and many others are 
mentioned in the chapters following, which are largely devoted to a 
careful presentation of such facts as could be obtained and veri- 
fied, up to this time, concerning the more important educational 
movements and occurrences of the past year. The second volume of 
this report, which is to appear about three months later than the one  
-P-A-G-E-32
  24 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
presented herewith, will contain statistical tables showing recent 
educational progress in this country, together with an account of the 
Alaska service of the Bureau of Education. Particular mention 
should be made of the committee under whose immediate oversight 
the present volume has been prepared, a committee consisting of Mr. 
L. A. Kalbach, chief clerk and acting commissioner ; Miss Anna Tolman 
Smith, translator; and Mr. Alexander Summers, statistician. Owing 
to losses from the staff of the editorial division, and particularly to 
the fact that for a large part of the year that division was unavoid- 
ably without a head, the volume has been prepared under unusual 
difficulties. It is due to the extraordinary labors of the committee 
referred to and of those associated with them that it goes to the 
printer in better form than might have been anticipated and at the 
time appointed. 
All of which is respectfully submitted.

GENERAL EDUCATION BOARD. 
The following statement of the work of the General Education 
Board was furnished by the assistant secretary of the board, Mr. 
E.-C. Sage: 
The General Education Board has three main lines of work : 
(1) The promotion of practical farming in the Southern States; 
(2) The development of a system of public high schools in the Southern 
States; and 
(8) The promotion of higher education throughout the United States, 
I. THE PROMOTION OF PRACTICAL FARMING IN THE SOUTHERN STATES. 
For the first three years of its existence the board, through its representatives, 
made a careful study of public education in the Southern States. As a result 
of this study it reached the conclusion that the greatest present need of that 
part of our country is the increased productive efficiency of rural life. Eighty- 
five per cent of the people of the Southern States live in the country and by 
farming.

  84 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
Careful inquiry was therefore made in the United States and in other coun- 
tries regarding methods of delivering to farmers the practical agricultural 
knowledge that has been developed by national and state departments of agri- 
culture, experimental farms, etc. In the course of this inquiry the representa- 
tives of the board met Dr. Seaman A. Knapp, who by demonstration farms was 
successfully combating the boll weevil in Texas and Louisiana. It was the 
opinion of the board that the demonstration-farm methods of Doctor Knapp 
could be employed suecessfully in promoting general agriculture as well as in 
combating the specific enemy of the cotton industry. A conference was there- 
fore had with Secretary Wilson, of the United States Department of Agriculture, 
who agreed that Doctor Knapp, who is a special representative of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, might supervise the work in other States than Texas and 
Louisiana, provided funds for that purpose might be secured. The General Edu- 
cation Board, through the Department of Agriculture, under the above agree- 
ment, beginning in the early part of 1906, has made contributions for this pur- 
pose now aggregating $398,700. For the fiscal year 1909-10 the appropriation 
was $113,000. The latest report from Doctor Knapp shows that in the States 
thus aided by the General Education Board 162 men are at work supervising the 
demonstration farms and 19,843 farmers are pursuing improved agricultural 
methods under such direction. He further estimates that 187,680 farmers are 
pursuing similar work as influenced by those farmers who are under the imme- 
diate supervision of the agents. This work has attracted the favorable atten- 
tion of the Farmers’ Union of the Southern States, of agricultural colleges, public 
school authorities, and the public press. Under the auspices of Doctor Knapp 
special state agents have been appointed in the several Southern States, who 
are conducting demonstration work among the boys of the public schools. Sey- 
eral thousands of boys from 12 years of age and up, under the general designa- 
tion of Boys’ Corn Clubs, are “ learning by doing; ” that is, instead of studying 
text-books on agriculture they are performing practical agricultural demonstra‘ 
tion on their fathers’ farms and are making these experiments the basis of agri- 
cultural study in the schools. In his latest communications to our office Doctor 
Knapp says that the work is developing in importance and value far beyond his 
most sanguine expectations. 
Il, THE PROMOTION OF PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The general study on educational conditions in the Southern States led the 
board to believe that the greatest lack in that region and, therefore, the greatest 
need was of public high schools. It is the policy of the board to do this work 
through existing organizations. Arrangement was therefore made with the 
several state universities in the Southern States whereby such universities 
could assume the leadership and direction of a movement designed to develop 
systems of high schools. Appropriations have been made by the General 
Education Board to the state universities in the following States: Alabama, 
Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Caro- 
lina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. 
The General Education Board appropriates to each university a sum sufli- 
cient to pay the salary and traveling expenses of a special high school repre- 
sentative. This man, representing the university and the state department of 
education, goes to counties throughout the State, arouses and organizes public 
sentiment favorable to high schools and secures the establishment and main- 
tenance of public high schools. In the following States we are able to give 
exact figures. The following high schools have been established: Alabama, 33; 
Florida, 10; Georgia, 46; Louisiana, 22; Mississippi, 37; North Carolina, 198; 
South Carolina, 85; Tennessee, 43; Virginia, 229.  
-P-A-G-E-43
  EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. 35 
As a result of this cooperative initiative on the part of the General Education 
Board 703 new high schools have been established and $6,390,780 have been 
raised: by the people for buildings and equipment. 
Of this work President Eliot, who has recently made a journey through the 
Southern States, has said: “It is the most valuable piece of constructive educa- 
tional work now going on in the United States.” 
Ill. THE PROMOTION OF INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING. 
The General Education Board uniformly makes its gifts for endowment. 
Colleges throughout the country decide how much money they wish to raise 
at a given time. Application is made to the General Education Board. A care- 
ful study of the institution is made covering both its financial and educational 
strength. It is studied not only as a particular institution of learning, but in 
its relation to higher education generally in a particular State. Then to ap- 
proved institutions the board makes contributions toward the total sums which 
they themselves have decided to raise. These contributions are made abso- 
lutely to the trustees of the several institutions and the General Education 
Board exercises no supervision or control in any case. It first decides that the 
institution is worthy of.aid and then makes its gift without any string attached 
to it. It is the conviction of the members of the board that they ought not to 
assume any supervision or control of the educational work in colleges. 
Appropriations by the board for higher education have been made as follows: 
CHS SOULNCL OS LRECS son ae ee ee ee ee $1, 537, 500 
  
  In the Western States. 2, 185, 000 
In the Eastern and Middle States. I, ee 
Total__ - 5,277, 500   
These gifts on the part of the General Education Board are toward an ap- 
proximate total of $23,000,000, which total sum represents the increase of 
educational endowment and equipment, largely made possible by the contribu- 
tions of the General Education Board. 
SCHOOLS FOR NEGROES. 
The board since its organization has contributed $464,015 to schools for 
negroes. The greater part of this contribution has been made to schools which 
train teachers. Contributions have also been made to schools founded and 
maintained by negroes where such schools have had connection with organiza- 
tions that afford supervision and audit. 
LE In this connection it should be said that negro farmers have shared fully in 
the cooperative demonstration work supported by the board under the ts 
of Doctor Knapp. 
CONCLUSION. 
It should be noted that the policy of the General Education Board is to 
work through existing institutions and agencies and not itself to undertake 
independent educational work. 
These contributions for agricultural demonstration work are expended under 
the supervision of the United States Department of Agriculture, which, through 
its accredited representatives, has entire control of such expenditures. Pay: 
ments are made by the General Education Board for this work on vouchers cer- 
tified by representatives of the Department of Agriculture. 
     
-P-A-G-E-44
  36 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
It seeks to promote public high schools not by sending its own agents into the 
several States to do this work, but by enabling state universities and state de- 
partments of education to do the work. Here, again, the direction and super- 
vision of the work is entirely in the hands of the accredited representatives of 
the States. 
Its contributions to colleges are not for specific departments in colleges or 
universities nor for particular kinds of education. The contributions are made 
to the trustees of the colleges, who have full power to direct the expenditure 
thereof. ‘The only promise required by the board in making its gifts is that 
the money which it gives shall be invested and preserved inviclable for the 
endowment of the college or university.

CARNEGIE FOUNDATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF TEACHING. 
In the Fourth Annual Report of the Carnegie Foundation for the 
Advancement of Teaching (October 1, 1908-September 30, 1909) 
President Pritchett discusses the following questions: Current busi- 
ness for the year, the working of the rules for retirement, tax- 
supported institutions, educational administration, and educational 
problems and progress. 
During the year 115 names were added to the roll of those receiv- 
ing retiring allowances, and the total grant for the year amounted 
to $176,890. Of those admitted to the benefits of the foundation, 62 
were professors and 13 were widows of professors in accepted insti- 
tutions; 37 were professors and 3 widows of professors in institutions 
not accepted. Forty-seven of the number were retired on the basis 
of age, 40 on the basis of service, and 12 on the basis of disability. 
The general average of retiring allowances for the year was $1,538.17. 
The total number of beneficiaries September 30, 1909, was 318, and 
the total grant in force at that date was $466,320. i institutions 
were admitted to the privileges of the foundation during the year, 
as follows: Swarthmore College, University of Michigan, University 
of Minnesota, University of Toronto, University of Wisconsin, Uni- 
versity of Missouri, and Coe College. 
The Randolph-Macon Woman’s College was withdrawn by action 
of the trustees of the college from the privileges of the foundation, 
and George Washington University was retired from the act¢epted 
list. 
During the year the state legislatures of 32 States adopted reso- 
lutions requesting the admission of their respective state institu- 
tions to the privileges of the foundation. 
In one State, that of Nebraska, the resolution favoring this action 
was defeated, and the resolution passed by the Texas legislature was 
not signed by the governor of the State. 
The exchange of secondary school teachers between the United 
States and Prussia has been in operation for two years. The details 
of the exchange are in charge of the Prussian minister of education 
for Prussian teachers and the Carnegie Foundation for American 
teachers. During the year 1908-9, 9 American teachers were assigned 
to Prussian schools and 6 Prussian teachers were assigned to schools 
in the United States. 
In regard to the benefits to be derived from an exchange of teach- 
ers, President Pritchett says: 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. 39 
I wish again to call attention to the fact that American secondary schools and 
those who are in charge of them have not yet begun to appreciate, in my judg- 
ment, the benefits to be had from this exchange. One can scarcely imagine a 
better means of stirring the life of the American high school than to receive into 
its corps of teachers for a year a well-trained teacher from a German gym- 
nasium, nor can one imagine any experience any more likely to quicken the 
life of a secondary school than to have its head master or one of its teachers 
spend a corresponding time in a German gymnasium. Notwithstanding these 
evident advantages, the exchange still presents some singular anomalies. There 
are many American teachers ready to pay their expenses in order to have 
this opportunity, but very few American secondary schools are ready to go to 
any expense in order to enable the teachers to take advantage of the oppor- 
tunity. Furthermore, very few secondary schools have as yet been willing to 
accept a Prussian teacher. It has been hard to overcome the idea that these 
teachers take the place of regular teachers of German, whereas the plan care- 
fully provides that such a teacher is an additional influence in the school, 
dealing with the teaching of the language from an entirely different point of 
view and bringing also the help of the experience of a well-conducted aa in 
another country. 
On the other hand, Prussian schools are glad to take American teachers 
for a year and to give such teachers full access to their schools and full share 
in the associations which the school life brings. 
There are, therefore, many openings for the American teacher who may 
volunteer, but hitherto there have been few openings in the United States for 
the German teachets who are ready to come. 
The most important action of the trustees of the foundation during 
the year was the amendment of the rules for retirement. The rules 
now in force were adopted November 17, 1909, and are as follows: 
Rute 1. Any person sixty-five years of age, who has had not less than fifteen 
years of service as a professor, or not less than twenty-five years of seryice as 
an instructor or as instructor and professor, and who is at the time a professor 
or an instructor in an accepted institution, shall be entitled to an annual retiring 
allowance, computed as follows: 
(a) For an active pay of twelve hundred dollars or less, an allowance of 
one thousand dollars, provided no retiring allowance shall exceed ninety per 
cent of the active pay. . 
(b) For an active pay greater than twelve hundred dollars the retiring 
allowance shall equal one thousand dollars, increased by fifty dollars for each 
one hundred dollars of active pay in excess of twelve hundred dollars. 
(ce) No retiring allowance shall exceed four thousand dollars. 
A Computed by the formula : R=35 +400, where R= annual retiring allowance   
and A= active pay. 
Rute 2. Any person who has bad twenty-five years of service as a professor 
or thirty years of service as a professor and instructor, and who is at the time 
either a professor or an instructor in an accepted institution, shall, in the case 
of disability unfitting him for the work of a teacher as proved by medical 
examination, be entitled to a retiring allowance computed as follows: 
(a) For an active pay of twelve hundred dollars or less, a retiring allowance 
of eight hundred dollars, provided that no retiring allowance shall exceed 
eighty per cent of the active pay. 
&  
-P-A-G-E-48

40 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
(b) For an active pay greater than twelve hundred dollars, the retiring 
allowance shall equal eight hundred dollars, increased by forty dollars for each 
one hundred dollars in excess of twelve hundred dollars. 
(ec) For each additional year of service above twenty-five for a professor, 
or above thirty for an instructor, the retiring allowance shall be increased by 
one per cent of the active pay. 
(dad) No retiring allowance shall exceed four thousand dollars. 
Computed by formula: c—— (b+15) + 820, where R= retiring allow- 
ance, A = active pay, and b = number of years service. 
Rute 3. A widow who has been for ten years the wife of a teacher, who at 
the time of his death was in receipt of a retiring allowance, or who at the 
time of his death was eligible to a retiring allowance, or who had had twenty- 
five years of service aS a professor, or thirty years of service as an instructor 
and professor, shall receive as a pension one-half of the retiring allowance to 
which her husband was entitled under Rule 1, or would have been entitled 
under Rule 2, in case of disability. 
Route 4. In the preceding rules, years of leave of absence are to be counted 
as year's of service, but not exceeding.one year in seven. Librarians, registrars, 
recorders, and administrative officers of long tenure whose salaries may be 
classed with those of professors and assistant professors are considered eligible 
to the benefits of a retiring allowance. 
Rute 5. Teachers in the professional departments of universities whose 
principal work is outside the profession of teaching are not included. 
Rutz 6. The benefits of the foundation shall not be available to those whose 
active service ceased before April 16, 1905, the date of Mr. Carnegie’s original 
letter to the trustees. 
Rute 7. In counting years of service toward a retiring allowance it is not 
necessary that the entire service shall have been given in institutions upon the 
accepted list of the foundation, but only years of service in an institution of 
higher education will be accepted as an equivalent. 
Rute 8. In no case shall any allowance be paid to a teacher who continues to 
give the whole or a part of his time to the work of teaching as a member of the 
instructing staff of any institution. 
Rute 9. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching retains 
the power to alter these rules in such a manner as experience may indicate as 
desirable for the benefit of the whole body of teachers.   
FLEXNER REPORT ON MEDICAL EDUCATION. 
The most important publication issued by the Carnegie Foundation 
during the year is the report on medical education, prepared by Mr. 
Abraham Flexner. The president of the foundation, Dr. Henry S. 
Pritchett, in his introductory statement, has explained very fully the 
considerations that gave rise to the investigation, the results of which 
are embodied in this report. Apart from those financial considera- 
tions that determine in great measure the nature and spirit of such in- 
vestigations, as conducted by the foundation, the report will undoubt- 
edly prove of great aid in the efforts made by the medical associations 
and medical schools to raise the standard of medical education. The 
value of the investigation, in this respect, is recognized even by those 
who take exception to many of its findings and conclusions. The 
®

subject will be treated somewhat fully under the head of medical 
education, in the second volume of the commissioner’s report. 
JOHN F. SLATER FUND. 
At the forty-second meeting of the trustees of the John F. Slater 
fund, held in New York City May 6, 1909, the finance committee 
recommended that $80,000 be designated for appropriations for the 
year 1909-10, and the educational committee presented a report rec- 
ommending that the sum of $66,950 be appropriated to 34 schools 
and colleges for the colored race. At the forty-third meeting of the 
trustees of the fund, held in New York City December 8, 1909, the 
educational committee recommended that $4,500 additional be appro- 
priated for the year 1909-10 to 11 schools for the race named. Upon 
recommendation of the educational committee the following resolu- 
tion was adopted at the latter meeting: 
Resolved, That in future appropriations in aid of public schools be in the 
form, where practicable, of appropriation for equipment or buildings, preferably 
for industrial work, in return for a stipulation of annual support. 
The trustees of the fund for the year 1909 were as follows: William 
A. Slater, president; Melville W. Fuller, vice-president; John A. 
Stewart, Alexander E. Orr, Cleveland H. Dodge, Seth Low, Wallace 
Buttrick, David F. Houston, Wickliffe Rose, Richard H. Williams, 
Walter H. Page. 
The field agents are G. S. Dickerman, New York City, and W. T. B. 
Williams, Hampton, Va. 
PEABODY EDUCATION FUND. 
The trustees of the Peabody education fund, at a meeting held in 
Washington, D. C., January 31, 1910, arranged to convey $1,000,000 
of the principal of the Peabody education fund to the George Peabody 
College for Teachers, located at Nashville, Tenn. The action was 
taken in view of the fact that the prescribed conditions, namely, that 
the State of Tennessee, the city of Nashville, and Davidson County 
should donate the sum of $500,000, had been fulfilled. 
The contribution from the Peabody fund is to be held as a perma- 
nent endowment, only the net income to be applied to the maintenance 
of the college; the bonds issued by the city of Nashville ($200,000) 
are to be used “ for the erection of buildings, or providing equipment, 
or for the increasing of the permanent endowment; ” the donation of 
the State of Tennessee ($250,000) is for “the establishment, support, 
maintenance, and use” of the George Peabody College for Teachers. 
STATE EDUCATIONAL COMMISSIONS. 
The policy of appointing state commissions to advise as to the 
means of bringing state systems of education into closer accord with
-P-A-G-E-50
  42 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
present demands has been adopted during the year by the five States 
named below. Reports are also noted showing the continuance and 
progress of previous commissions. 
ARKANSAS EDUCATION COMMISSION. 
The Arkansas education commission, recently appointed by the 
governor of the State, held its first meeting July 28, 1910, and de- 
cided to issue at an early date a preliminary report embracing the 
following subjects: 
1. Historical statement of formation of commission. 
2. Review of the work of similar commissions in other States. 
3. Need of work of commission in the State of Arkansas.

school system along the following lines: (a) Establishment of a 
state board of education; (6) consolidation of weak schools; (¢) 
state aid for town and country high schools.

patriotic citizens. 
It was proposed, also, to hold public meetings in different parts 
of the State, and to issue a series of bulletins from time to time on 
the progress of the work. 
For the purpose of crystallizing public sentiment and eventually 
influencing legislation, the commission issued circular letters to the 
ministers of the State, asking them to deliver sermons on public- 
school education in Arkansas during the month of August. 
The officers of the commission, which consists of 21 members, are 
George B. Cook, state superintendent of public instruction, ex officio 
chairman, Little Rock; Dr. Henry 8. Hartzog, secretary, Arka- 
delphia; B. A. Fletcher, Augusta; R. H. McCullough, Beebe; J. H.

Association, the governor of Colorado, under date of March 21, 1910, 
appointed an educational commission, charged with the following 
duties: 
To make a thorough investigation of the school system and all the educational 
interests of Colorado, and the laws under which the same are organized and 
operated; to make a comparative study of the school systems of Colorado and 
the laws of such other States as may seem advisable; and to submit to the chief

executive of Colorado a report, embracing such suggestions, revisions, correc- 
tions, and amendments, as the committee shall deem appropriate, to the end 
that the free public-school system shall be maintained for the good of the public 
in a most thorough and uniform manner, as contemplated and directed by the 
constitution. 
The members of the commission are Hon. Frank E. Gove, Hon.

intendent of city schools, Denver; Prof. W. B. Mooney, State Normal 
School, Greeley ; Frank E. Thompson, superintendent of city schools, 
Canon City; and Mrs. Katherine Cook, state superintendent of public

IDAHO STATE SCHOOL LAW COMMISSION. 
An act of the legislature of Idaho, bearing date March 15, 1909, 
provides for a commission charged with substantially the same duties 
as those of the Colorado commission. 
The Idaho commission is required to submit a report to the eleventh 
session of the legislature of Idaho, which report shall show the results 
of all investigations made as above provided; together with a com- 
plete statement of the proposed amendments or additions to the school 
laws of Idaho. The sum of $500 was appropriated to carry out the 
provisions of the act. 
The commission, which is to continue in office until April 1, 1911, 
consists of three members, one of whom, by the terms of the law, must 
be the state superintendent of public instruction. 
MAINE COMMITTEE FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
An act of the legislature of the State of Maine, approved March 
12, 1909, authorized the expenditure of $1,000 for the year 1909, and a 
like sum for the year 1910, under the direction of the state superin- 
tendent of public instruction, for the purpose of making a special 
investigation of the needs of the State in relation to a system of 
vocational or industrial education, together with an investigation 
into the methods adopted by other States and countries for meeting 
similar needs. 
Dr. Payson Smith, state superintendent of public instruction, ap- 
pointed the following persons to serve on the committee: Francis R. 
North, principal of high school, Portland, secretary; Dr. George E. 
Fellows, president of the University of Maine; William E. Sargent, 
principal of Hebron Academy; C. S. Stetson, Greene; E. M. Bland- 
ing, Bangor; and Charles O. Beals, Auburn. 
A report of the committee will be made at the next session of the 
legislature which convenes in January, 1911. 
SOUTH CAROLINA EDUCATIONAL COMMISSION. 
An act of the general assembly of the State of South Carolina, 
approved February 23, 1910, provides for an educational commis-
-P-A-G-E-52
  44 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
sion charged with the work of examining and revising the common 
and high school laws, and with power to recommend any change in 
the existing law. It is further provided that the commission shall 
consist of the state superintendent of public instruction, the in- 
spector of high schools, the president of one of the state institutions 
of higher education, one person familiar with graded and common 
school systems, and one person learned in the law, and that the mem- 
bers not specifically designated shall be appointed by the governor. 
In accordance with this provision, the following persons have been 
appointed members of the commission: John E. Swearingen, state 
superintendent of public instruction, chairman; William H. Hand, 
inspector of high schools, secretary; D. B. Johnson, president of 
Winthrop Normal and Industrial College; Samuel H. Edmunds, city 
superintendent of schools, Sumter; and M. L. Smith, Camden. They 
have entered upon the preliminary investigation, a report of which 
will be submitted to the general assembly at its next session, 
[For notices of the formation of previous state commissions, see 
Report of the Commissioner of Education, 1908, Vol. I, pp. 42-49; 
and Report, 1909, Vol. I, pp. 44-52.] 
ILLINOIS EDUCATIONAL COMMISSION. 
The Illinois educational commission, authorized by the forty-fifth 
general assembly, 1907, and appointed by the governor to study the 
school system of the State of Illinois and the laws under which it 
operates, to codify these laws and to suggest such amendments as 
seemed necessary, was unable for want of time to complete its work. 
The codification of the school laws and one of the amendments sug- 
gested were enacted into law by the forty-sixth general assembly and 
$5,000 appropriated to the department of public instruction to com- 
plete and publish the work of the commission. In order that the . 
work begun might be properly completed, Governor Deneen reap- 
pointed the old members of the commission, filling two vacancies by 
the appointment of new members. The commission as reappointed is 
as follows: Francis G. Blair, superintendent of public instruction, 
Springfield, ex officio chairman; President Edmund J. James, Uni- 
versity of Illinois, Urbana; President A. J. Burrowes, St. Ignatius 
College, Chicago; Principal Alfred Bayliss, Western Tlinois Normal 
School, Macomb; W. L. Steele, city superintendent of schools, Gales- 
burg; A. F. Nightingale, county superintendent of schools, Chicago; 
Principal Harry Taylor, Harrisburg; R. E. Hieronymus, Eureka, 
secretary of the commission. 
The previous commission made a final report to the general assembly 
in 1909. Among the recommendations contained in the report are the 
following:
-P-A-G-E-53
  EDUCATIONAL BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. 45 
I. The adoption of the revised, simplified, condensed, and codified 
form of the existing school law, published in the commission’s 
Bulletin No. 6. 
II. The amendment of this revised general school Jaw in the follow- 
ing particulars: 
1. Providing for a uniform system of bookkeeping by township treasurers, and 
promptness in their accounts. 
2. Extending minimum school term from six to seven months. 
3. Making school month four weeks of five days each (instead of calendar 
month). 
4, Making 18 years minimum age for teaching. 
5. Forbidding anyone to teach unless holding due certificate. 
6. Prescribing a classified register of pupils to be kept by teachers in addition 
to the daily register. 
7. Forbidding, in cities of less than 100,000 inhabitants, school boards to dis- 
charge teachers except for cause, upon written charges, and after a hearing. 
8. Permitting school boards to employ a superintendent for periods of four 
years after two years’ probation. 
9. Limiting school boards in districts of from 1,000 to 100,000 inhabitants 
(not under special charters) to a president and six members. 
10. Authorizing school boards in cities of more than 10,000 inhabitants to 
purchase sites and build schoolhouses without taking a vote of the district. 
11. Providing for the purchase of libraries and apparatus “ when needed.” 
12. Traveling expenses of county superintendents to be paid by county board. 
18. Providing unequivocally for free high school privileges to pupils residing 
where no high school is established. 
14. So phrasing the school tax law that the state aid to schools will be 
increased from $1,000,000 to about $2,500,000. 
The commission had previously introduced in the legislature five 
bills embodying their larger amendments, containing provisions as 
follows: (1) For a state board of education; (2) for a uniform sys- 
tem of examinations for intending teachers; (3) for a permissive 
township system of school organization; (4) for an increase in the 
salaries of county superintendents; (5) for county teachers’ institutes. 
Recommendations 9 and 10 above are designed to offer inducements 
to cities under special charters to surrender their charters and or- 
ganize under the general school law. The 35 districts now under 
special charters “give rise to more vexatious legal questions than 
all of the 11,785 other school districts put together.” 
The commission recommended the enactment of a law making the 
minimum salary of teachers holding second-grade certificates $45, 
first grade $55. 
MARYLAND EDUCATIONAL COMMISSION. 
Hon. J. Charles Linthicum, chairman of the Maryland educational 
commission, in his report to the governor, dated December 10, 1909, 
made, among others, the following recommendations: 
I. Against state adoption and purchase of text-books (which had been pro- 
posed), but requiring the approval by the state school board of the selections of  
-P-A-G-E-54
  46 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
books and contracts for purchases made by county boards. Instead of the State 
making a specific provision of $150,000 annually for free text-books, as hereto- 
fore, it was recommended that county boards be required to furnish the neces- 
sary books to all pupils. 
Il. The devising of some plan for increasing the attendance at the State 
Normal School, or, failing that, the establishment by county boards of teachers’ 
training classes in approved high schools. 
III. The establishment of a manual training department and a commercial 
course in each high school. 
IV. Provision for making education of an industrial character a part of the 
daily instruction of every colored school. 
VY. The continuation of the school tax rate of 16 cents for general school 
purposes. 
VI. Financial aid to the colleges of the State in the form of scholarships, 
covering tuition fees and board, to be given to worthy young men and women, 
otherwise unable to go to college; this in view of the State having no university 
of its own. 
VII. The articulation of the courses of the various grades of instruction 
from the high school to the university. To this end is suggested “a committee 
or board to be composed of the presidents of the Johns Hopkins University, the 
colleges receiving state appropriations, and the state superintendent of educa- 
tion, who shall meet from time to time to consider the several curricula so as 
to prevent overlapping of work.” 
VIII. Instruction in the elements of agriculture in all the schools, and a 
closer union between the state agricultual college and the public-school system. 
IX. The apportionment of the state school tax upon the basis of the number 
of children actually attending school, the number of teachers, and the county 
school tax. 
X. The formulation of some plan for expert county supervision. 
VIRGINIA EDUCATION COMMISSION. 
The Virginia education commission, created by an act of the legis- 
lature March 13, 1908, and charged with the duty of devising a 
stable and systematic method for the maintenance, management, and 
expansion of the higher educational institutions with reference to a 
definite and harmonious educational system, was continued by an act 
of March 15, 1910, and instructed to report at the next session of the 
legislature. 
The sum of $500 was appropriated by the legislature to continue 
the work of the commission, and the trustees of the Peabody educa- 
tion fund donated $3,000 to meet the expenses of a thorough investi- 
gation and to pay the salary of a permanent secretary. 
The commission is composed of Dr. Edwin A. Alderman, president 
of the University of Virginia, chairman; Mr. Charles G. Maphis, 
president of state board of examiners, secretary; Hon. Richard E. 
Byrd, speaker of the house of delegates; Mr. Joseph D. Eggleston, 
jr., state superintendent of public instruction; Dr. Joseph L. Jarman, 
president Farmville Normal School; Hon. E. E. Holland, state 
senator; Dr. Charles M. Hazen, Medical College of Virginia; and 
Dr. W. W. Smith, president Randolph-Macon Woman’s College.

NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
Orrice or THE SecrETaRyY, 
Winona, Minn., October 5, 1910. 
My Dear Sir: By the provisions of section 4 of the act of incor- 
poration of the National Education Association by Congress, ap- 
proved June 30, 1906, I am required to render to you, on behalf of 
the corporation of said association, an annual report stating the 
amount of property, real and personal, held by the corporation and 
the various receipts and expenditures during the past year. 
I am submitting herewith such a report, as follows: 
The association holds as personal property approximately 10,000 
volumes of proceedings in the depository of the association at the 
office of the secretary in Winona, Minn., valued at $10,000; 5,000 
pamphlets and reprints, valued at $800; office furniture, cases, and 
equipment, valued at $500; total personal property at Winona, 
$11,300. 
An office is maintained in the city of Washington, at the Bucking- 
ham, in accordance with section 8 of the act of incorporation, but 
the association owns no property, real or personal, in the city of 
Washington, 
The business of the association is transacted at the office established 
by authority of the board of directors at Winona, Minn. 
The association has a permanent invested fund, referred to in sec- 
tion 7 of the act of incorporation, which is in the charge of the board 
of trustees. This fund, at the close of the last fiscal year, June 30, 
1910, amounted to $170,100, as per the accompanying Exhibit A, 
which constitutes the ‘twenty-fourth annual report of the board of 
trustees. 
You will note that the net revenue from this fund amounted to 
$6,761.73, which was transferred to the treasury of the association 
for current expenses. 
The fiscal year of the association is from July 1 to the following 
June 30, the last fiscal year closing June 30, 1910. For this last fiscal 
year the total receipts for current expenses from all sources were 
$34,787.97; the total expenses for the year were $30,235.92, leaving 
a balance in the treasury June 30, 1910, of $4,552.05. 
The chief sources of revenue are membership fees, proceeds of sale 
of volumes and reports, revenue from the invested fund. 
The chief sources of expense of the association are the printing 
and distribution of the annual volumes, the maintenance of the secre-  
-P-A-G-E-56
  48 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
tary’s office and clerical force at Winona, Minn., and the expense of 
preparing for and conducting the annual convention. 
While a large part of the revenue comes from the associate mem- 
bership fees received at the annual convention, a still larger amount 
comes as annual dues of $2 for each member from approximately 
7,000 active (permanent) members of the association. 
The last convention of the association, held at Boston, Mass., July 
2 to 8, was in every respect successful, but no special action was 
taken which would probably be deemed essential or important to 
embody in this report. 
I am, respectfully, yours, 
Irwin Sueparp, Secretary.

The total registration at the Boston convention (the forty-eighth) 
was 12,385. The most prominent feature of the convention was the 
opening session held in the stadium of Harvard University, which 
was addressed by the President of the United States, William How- 
ard Taft, on “The relation of education to democratic government ;” 
by Hon. William Walton Kitchin, governor of North Carolina, on 
“The development of American independence under our common- 
school system;” and by President David Starr Jordan, of Leland 
Stanford Junior University, Stanford University, Cal., on “ War and 
manhood.” The exercises were interspersed with music by the 
Handel and Haydn Society of Boston, accompanied by Stewart’s 
military band. The numbers sung in which the great audience joined 
were “America,” “To Thee, O Country!” “ Unfold, Ye Portals!” 
and “ The Star Spangled Banner.” 
The other general sessions and the sessions of all of the seventeen 
departments were unusually successful. Although a great variety of 
important topics were discussed, the subjects of industrial education, 
physical education and school hygiene, special education for back- 
ward children, and rural and agricultural education were prominent. 
It should be said that the following societies held profitable ses- 
sions on the same dates, usually meeting in the afternoons so as to 
avoid conflict with the department meetings of the association, viz: 
The American School Peace League, The American Home Economics 
Association, Federation of State Teachers’ Associations, The Re- 
ligious Education Association, National Committee of Agricultural 
Education, Educational Press Association of America, Conference of 
Teachers of Agriculture, Massachusetts Medical Gymnastic Society, 
The School Garden Association, The Moral Education Board. These 
societies held their sessions under the auspices of the National Edu- 
cation Association, which had arranged for their accommodation and 
had published their programmes with its own. 
The following officers were elected for the ensuing year: President, 
Supt. Ella Flagg Young, of Chicago, Ill.; vice-presidents, James Y.

DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES AND AIMS. 
The following declaration of principles and of aims was made by 
the association in convention assembled : 
The National Education Association, now holding its forty-eighth annual con- 
vention in the city of Boston, representing every educational interest of the 
nation, makes the following declaration of principles: 
1. We reaffirm our faith in the schools of the Republic, believing that it is 
impossible for the citizens of a great democracy to develop power and efficiency 
without the public schools, owned and controlled by the people. 
2. A federal office of education is necessary to the best development of educa- 
tion in the several States. The National Bureau of Education has for many 
years rendered a splendid service in disseminating information and developing 
educational ideals. During the past few years its increasing service and en- 
hanced efticiency have been marked and stimulating. The plans which are now 
projected have the earnest approval and the enthusiastic indorsement of the 
educational interests of the entire country. The members of this association 
hereby express their appreciation of the provision made for the better housing 
of the bureau and the enlargement of its staff. We further respectfully urge on 
the Congress an increased appropriation for its support. In particular we urge 
that in addition to the nsual appropriations the sum of $75,000 be made available 
at the next session of Congress for the organization of a more adequate staff of 
specialists, with particular reference to work in the field. 
3. In the judgment of the National Education Association the time has ar- 
rived for the formation of an international council of education, to be com- 
posed of leading educators from all the principal nations of the globe, the first 
meeting of the council to be held in Washington, D. C., at some time during the 
year 1911. The association hereby appoints the United States Commissioner of 
Education, the president and all living ex-presidents of the National Education 
Association, and seven others, to be chosen by the above designated persons, as 
a committee to formulate plans for such an international council and to attend 
to their execution. 
4. The fundamental consideration in any system of schools is the development 
of inflexible integrity and strong moral character in those receiving instruction. 
The Republic can not survive without a citizenship with high ideals of patriot- 
ism, duty, and service. This association, therefore, commends most heartily the 
growing interest in the moral development of the children of the nation. 
5. While the members of this association are of the opinion that the old 
courses of study, which had as their chief object the giving of culture to the 
individual and of transmitting to him the best ideas and ideals of the past, 
should in no manner be weakened, we, nevertheless, very sincerely indorse the 
movement to make the courses of study offered in our schools more democratic, 
that they may meet the conditions of our modern commercial and industrial
-P-A-G-E-59
  EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. 51 
life. However, to meet adequately these new demands imposes upon the schools 
of the country additional financial responsibilities, and this association appeals 
to the nation and to the States for more liberal appropriations for educational 
purposes in order that this additional work in agriculture, in the trades and 
industries, and in home economics may be effectively undertaken. 
6. No country that is physically weak or physically diseased can attain its 
possible greatness. All efforts, therefore, to make the condition of our educa- 
tional plants more sanitary and to impress upon the minds of the children and 
the citizens of the nation the importance of the proper observance of the laws of 
health—public and individual—should receive the support and hearty coopera- 
tion of American teachers. 
7. The abuses attending the employment of children in industrial occupations 
tend to limit their educational opportunities, and this association, therefore, 
indorses all such wise and humane legislation as shall make possible the 
broadest development of all the children. 
8. The character and efficiency of the schools must depend in the future, as in 
the past, upon the character and efficiency of the teachers. The profession of 
teaching should therefore attract men and women of the highest intellectual 
attainments, broadest culture, most thorough training, and loftiest ideals; to 
this end the salaries paid American teachers should be commensurate with 
salaries paid in other professions and in commercial and industrial pursuits. 
9. The association reaffirms its declaration in the year of the last Hague 
conference of the preeminent duty of the teachers of the United States, and of 
all the nations, to advance this commanding movement of our time for the 
world’s peace; and we record our profound satisfaction at the noteworthy 
development of attention to this high interest in our schools and colleges, and 
the rapid progress of the cause among all peoples. We herewith express our 
special satisfaction in the recent declaration of the President of the United 
States in behalf of the settlement by arbitration of all differences whatever 
between nations. With equal gratitude we indorse the resolution adopted by 
the Congress of the United States for the appointment of a commission to 
consider measures for the reduction of the burdensome armaments of the 
nations. 
10. The National Education Association reaffirms its unalterable opposition 
to any division of the public school funds among private or sectarian schools 
and believes that any appropriation from the federal or state treasuries in sup- 
port of private educational institutions is in direct contravention of the funda- 
mental principles upon which our system of American public-school education 
has been founded.

REORGANIZATION OF DEPARTMENTS. 
In the report of last year a statement was made of the action of the 
board of directors, consolidating certain departments with others and
-P-A-G-E-60
  52 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
reducing the entire number to nine. The carrying out of this action 
was delegated to the executive committee of the association. This 
committee found it difficult to put the new plan into effect, partly 
because officers had been elected for all of the different departments, 
and also because of earnest opposition to the plan by the officers and 
members of several of the departments on the ground that the action 
had been taken without due notice and without giving an opportunity 
for the advocates of the separate departments to be heard in the inter- 
ests of separate organization. 
Accordingly, the executive committee submitted to the board of 
directors, for a vote by correspondence, a proposition for delaying 
the execution of the plan for one year. ‘The result of this vote was 
that 62 directors voted in favor of postponement, 4 voted against 
postponement, and 12 directors did not vote. 
Accordingly, the various departments were continued and met at 
Boston under their separate organizations, except that the depart- 
ments of technical education and of Indian education were discon- 
tinued in accordance with application from the officers of these de- 
partments; and the department of art education was combined with 
the department of manual training under the title of the department 
of manual training and art education, in accordance with the joint 
action of the two departments taken at the Denver convention. 
The question of consolidation, therefore, came before the board of 
directors at a special meeting held to consider the same on July 5. 
After full consideration and hearing representatives of several of the 
departments affected by the action taken a year ago, the directors 
voted to rescind that action excepting in so far as it applied to the 
department of manual training and art education. By a subsequent 
resolution the question was again referred to the original committee 
on the consolidation of departments, as reconstructed by the action 
of the directors at the Denver convention. The effect of this action 
is to continue the departments as heretofore for the current year, 
pending another report by the committee on consolidation, which will 
be made at the next annual meeting. 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE: 
SECTION L—EDUCATION. 
[From a report made to Science by C. R. Mann, secretary of section L.] 
The annual meeting of the American Association for the Advance- 
ment of Science was held in Boston December 27-31, 1909. 
The sessions of Section L, Education, were conducted in accordance 
with the policy adopted at the previous meeting—the attention of 
the members at each session being concentrated upon a single topic. 
Dr. John Dewey, the retiring vice-president, presented a paper on 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
  
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. 53 
the subject, “Science as method and as information.” The subjects 
considered in the successive meetings were as follows: “ Formulated 
scientific problems in general education,” “Scientific studies of the 
American college,” and the report of the committee on the “ Distribu- 
tion of students in college courses.” 
The report above referred to was presented by Prof. E. L. Thorn- 
dike, chairman of the committee. The following resolutions embodied 
in the report were adopted by the section: 
Resolved, That samples of the facts concerning the number of students taught 
by one instructor be sent to the colleges and universities on the list of the 
United States Bureau of Education. 
That those in charge of collegiate instruction in each of these institutions be 
requested to report in print or to this committee any facts concerning the 
relation of the size of class to efficiency in teaching, with special reference to 
the following questions: 
1. Is not the number of students taught at one time by a single individual in 
many college courses so great as to reduce that individual’s knowledge of the 
attitude, preparation, difficulties, errors, and achievements of his students to 
almost zero? 
2. Is not the number of students taught at one time by a single individual in 
many college courses so small as to involve an enormous waste of the in- 
structor’s time and an improper distribution of the appropriations for teaching? 
8. Other things being equal, should not the teaching of more than 40 college 
students at one time by one person be avoided? Should not any department 
have reasons of weight for any such case? 
4. Other things being equal, should not the use of a quarter or more of a pro- 
fessor’s teaching hours for a year for the instruction of fewer than 10 students 
in one undergraduate course, counting one-twentieth or less of the degree’s 
total requirement, be avoided? Should not any department have reasons of 
weight for any such case? 
5. Should not the traditional method of having the ratio which the number of 
class meetings is to the number of “points” credit the same, regardless of 
whether the class enrollment is 1, 5, 20, or 100, be abandoned in many of the 
undergraduate courses enrolling less than 10 students? 
6. When, in a college course given annually, the number of students is less 
than 6, should not the course be offered only once in two years, except for 
reasons of weight? 
Resolved, That those in charge of collegiate education in the colleges and uni- 
versities on the list of the United States Bureau of Education be requested to 
consider the advisability of reporting for 1910, and once in every ten years 
thereafter, a detailed statement of the work done for the bachelor’s degree by 
each member of the graduating class or by each of 100 students chosen at 
random from it. 
Joint sessions of the section were held with the American Federa- 
tion of Teachers of the Mathematical and Natural Sciences, the 
Social Education Club of Boston, and Section B, Physics, of the 
American Association for the Advancement of Science. “ Equal op- 
portunity for all” was the general topic for-discussion at the joint 
meeting with the Social Education Club. President Albert Ross 
Hill, of the University of Missouri, was elected vice-president of

was elected member of the sectional committee. 
AMERICAN FEDERATION OF ARTS. 
The American Federation of Arts held its first annual convention 
in Washington, D. C., May 17-19, 1910, with delegates from about 
one hundred affiliated organizations in attendance. 
Committees were appointed to report at the next convention on 
exhibitions and lectures in universities, art in the public schools, and 
teaching the history of art in universities and colleges. The federa- 
tion maintains permanent offices in the city of Washington, and 
during the past year has loaned collections of paintings by American 
artists to a number of cities for exhibition purposes, and has also pro- 
vided for illustrated lectures on American painting, American art, 
and civic art. 
Art and Progress, a monthly journal, is published by the federation. 
The following officers were elected for the ensuing year: President, 
Charles L. Hutchinson; first vice-president, Herbert Adams; secre- 
tary, F. D. Millet; treasurer, Marvin F. Scaife. 
AMERICAN FEDERATION OF THE TEACHERS OF THE MATHEMATICAL 
AND NATURAL SCIENCES. 
The annual meeting of the council of the American Federation of 
the Teachers of the Mathematical and Natural Sciences was held at 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, Mass., December 
27, 1909. Twenty-two representatives of eight associations were 
present. The report of the executive committee showed that six asso- 
ciations had joined the federation during the past year. The total 
number of paid-up members in the associations that belong to the 
federation now amounts to 2,040. 
The committee on a syllabus in geometry reported that the work 
was in progress and outlined their plan under the following divisions: 
1. Logical considerations, including axioms, definitions, symbols, new terms, 
forms of proof, treatment of limits and incommensurables, purpose (whether 
formal or practical), place in the curriculum, etc. 
2. Lists of basal theorems, including types of courses as given in various 
countries, types of courses for different classes of students, e. g., for boys, for 
girls, for technical students, for college preparation, for noncollege preparation, 
minimum list of theorems for various standard courses, grouping or classifica- 
tion of theorems, etc. 
38. Exercises and applications, including the grading and distribution of exer- 
cises, relative importance of algebraic and geometric work, special classes of 
exercises such as loci problems, correlation with other subjects, such as trigo- 
nometry, concrete applications related to drawing, decoration, architecture, 
ornamental design, mensuration, surveying, machinery, etc. 
The committee on college entrance requirements recommended that 
a committee of three be appointed to confer with the college entrance

lyn Polytechnic Institute, New York City. 
ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL ACCOUNTING OFFICERS. 
A meeting of school auditing officers, called by the Commis- 
sioner of Education at the request of several of the officials referred 
to, was held May 17, 1910, at the Bureau of Education, Washington, 
D. C., and an association was organized at that time for the purpose 
of bringing about the standardization of fiscal, physical, and edu- 
cational data of school systems. 
The officers of the association are as follows: President, Joseph 
McBride, auditor of board of education, Los Angeles, Cal.; secretary, 
William Dick, secretary of board of education, Philadelphia; treas- 
urer, Alonzo Tweedale, auditor, District of Columbia, Washington,

mittee on standardization: Henry R. M. Cook, auditor of the board 
of education, New York City; William T. Keough, business agent 
school committee, Boston; and Charles P. Mason, secretary and 
treasurer board of education, St. Louis, Mo. 
ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARATORY SCHOOLS OF THE 
MIDDLE STATES AND MARYLAND. 
The twenty-third annual convention of the association was held in 
Washington, D. C., November 26-27, 1909, under the auspices of the 
universities, colleges, and schools of that city. The association com- 
prises 187 schools and colleges and was represented at the convention 
by 102 delegates. 
The committee on entrance requirements in English presented a 
report embodying the requirements adopted at the conference on 
uniform entrance requirements in English February 22, 1909, which 
was adopted by the association. 
The principal officers for the year 1909-10 are: President, James 
M. Green, State Normal and Model School, Trenton, N. J.; secretary, 
Arthur H. Quinn, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pa. 
ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND PREPARATORY SCHOOLS OF THE 
SOUTHERN STATES.

ville, Va., November 5-6, 1909. The association now numbers 21 
colleges and universities and 38 preparatory schools. 
The officers are: President, Dr. Robert E. Blackwell, Randolph- 
Macon College, Ashland, Va.; secretary and treasurer, Prof. Frederic

CATHOLIC EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
The sixth annual meeting of the Catholic Education Association 
was held in Boston, July 12-15, 1909. 
The roll of the association comprised 67 colleges, 16 seminaries, and 
980 members and schools in the parish school department; delegates 
were present from all the States and from the Dominion of Canada. 
The association is organized in three departments: A college de- 
partment with sections devoted to Latin, science, history, modern 
language and Greek, and philosophy; a parish school department 
with sections for the instruction of deaf-mutes, and for superintend- 
ents; and a seminary department. The science section was created 
April, 1909. A committee previously appointed to consider the ad- 
visability of creating a high-school department reported progress at 
the meeting referred to and was continued to report at the next 
meeting. 
The report of this committee at the present session covered all 
the factors that enter into the high-school or secondary-school prob- 
‘lem of the hour. In the discussion of the report emphasis was placed 
upon the fact that the “system of coordinating the high school with 
the college,” after the model of “the German gymnasium and the 
French lycée,” represents the “ tradition of Catholic colleges.” 
The principal officers for 1909-10 are: President-general, Very 
Rev. T. J. Shahan, Washington, D. C.; secretary-general, Rev. 
Francis W. Howard, Columbus, Ohio; treasurer-general, Rev. 
Francis T. Moran, Cleveland, Ohio.

teachers in the world, was formed in 1905 and has 1,700 members. 
Its territory now includes 28 States, and extends as far west as Idaho 
and as far as Virginia and the States along the southern coast. 
The fifth annual meeting was held April 29 and 30, 1910, at the 
University of Chicago. 
The officers of the ‘association are: Prof. F. C. Eastman, University 
of Iowa, president; Theodore C. Burgess, director of Bradley Poly- 
technic Institute, Peoria, Ill., permanent secretary-treasurer.

CONFERENCE OF CHIEF STATE SCHOOL OFFICERS. 
The fourth conference of the United States Commissioner of Edu- 
cation and the chief state school officers of the several States was held 
in connection with the meeting of the department of superintendence 
in Indianapolis, Ind., on the evening of March 3, 1910. The Commis- 
sioner of Education was chosen as chairman, and George B. Cook, 
state superintendent of Arkansas, as secretary. After an introductory 
address by the chairman, Robert J. Aley, state superintendent of 
Indiana, opened the discussion of the topic chosen for the confer- 
ence, “ Desirable uniformity and desirable diversity in the educational 
legislation of the several States.” Dr. Harlan Updegraff, specialist 
in school administration in the United States Bureau of Education, 
outlined the immediate plans of the bureau in relation to the state 
education offices, prominent among which is the purpose to render 
assistance in all matters pertaining to educational legislation. These 
two addresses furnished the basis for the general discussion, which 
was participated in by the following state education officers: Mrs. 
Katherine M. Cook, of Colorado; John F. Riggs, of Iowa; T. H. 
Harris, of Louisiana; C. G. Schulz, of Minnesota; E. C. Bishop, of 
Nebraska; J. E. Clark, of New Mexico; A. 8. Downing, first assistant 
commissioner of New York; J. Y. Joyner, of North Carolina; N. C. 
Schaeffer, of Pennsylvania; F. M. Bralley, of Texas; and C. P. 
Carey, of Wisconsin. Eighteen States were represented. 
Among other matters, the speakers ee the desirability of 
the following: 
(1) A combined digest of the educational jewislation of the several 
States. (2) Uniform standards in statistical reports. (8) Uniform 
standards in the licensing of teachers. (4) Closer relations in the 
recognition of teachers’ certificates among the various States. (5) 
A systematic provision for keeping the various state officers informed 
regarding successful new procedures in the conduct of state school 
systems, as for example, in the improvement of teachers in service 
through institutes, summer schools, and reading circles. (6) Diver- 
sity in educational legislation in those matters closely related to the 
general civil administration, as in territorial units of control, form 
and authority of local school offices, and methods of taxation. (7) 
Diversity in permitting the trial of a wider range of methods of 
administration. 
After the passing of a standing vote of approval and appreciation 
of the recent action of the Bureau of Education in the interest of the 
state education offices, which was moved by Mr. Bralley, of Texas, the 
conference adjourned subject to the call of the United States Com- 
missioner of Education,

CONFERENCE FOR EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 
The Thirteenth Annual Conference for Education in the South was 
held in Little Rock, Ark., April 6-8, 1910, with a registration of 1,200 
members in attendance. As is customary, the meetings of the asso- 
ciations of Southern State Superintendents and Supervisors of 
‘Women’s School Improvement Work were held in conjunction with 
the conference. 
In accordance with the request of the conference, the president, 
Mr. Robert C. Ogden, introduced the meeting by a historical review 
of the purposes and work of the organization. He said in part: 
Our association is called the Conference for Education in the South. It is, 
so far as I know, the only popular civic organization in the interests of educa- 
tion in the country. Other sections of the country need it, and, in the judgment 
of many, it should have a national character, The Nation is treated as a 
whole by civic organizations for the improvement of municipal government, 
for the beautifying of towns and cities, for charities and correction, for indus- 
trial education, for the standardizing of higher education. Why not then for 
emphasizing the duty of the citizen, the man in the street, in respect of 
education? 
I am almost led to exclaim, and would, were it not for some reasons that 
will follow: ‘‘ May the time come, and come soon, when this organization may 
broaden its influence until it shall be wide as the continent and long as the 
Jand.” 
Some advantages exist, however, in the more limited and local character of 
the conference work. It took the organization four years to find itself. Hap- 
pily, when its mission was discovered it was not so big as to lose itself in its 
own vastness. Social influences have always surrounded it, and it has been a 
dynamic power in the development and uplift of many a lonely soul. Through- 
out the States represented here there were, before this association came into 
being, thousands of people in rural places, with clear vision as to the educational 
needs of the rural people, whose lives were consumed with hopeless longing, 
whose minds were keen as to what ought to be done and yet could not see even 
the faintest glimmer of the early dawn of a better day. There are many such 
yet, but the class that has been brought into large and sympathetic fellowship 
by this conference, in whom inspiration and faith have been developed, would 
of itself alone justify all the cost in labor and in money that has been expended 
upon it. One of the clearest thinkers and ablest writers on educational, 
economic, and social questions in the South has said that this conference has 
taught the South to know itself in educational matters. And I am sure 
he is right. 
Another local advantage is found in the fact that while the South has all 
the general questions of education that pertain to all the rest of the country, 
it has superadded certain ‘conditions peculiarly its own. In summing up 
the reasons for the existence of this conference it may be concluded that for 
the immediate future at least it will be found advantageous to allow it to live 
its life upon present lines.

I am told, and I think the statement is accurate, that during the last seven 
years the public appropriations for education in the States under the influence 
of the Southern Education Board have increased $16,000,000 per annum. These 
figures are difficult of verification, but probably are greater than I have
-P-A-G-E-67
  EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. 59 
stated. We have had something to do with this result; how much may not be 
a subject for definite calculation. 
This conference has reproduced itself in many directions. In Virginia it 
developed the Cooperative Education Association with which the Southern 
Education Board is in sympathetic and material relation. This association 
has created branch organizations in many countries of the State; has raised 
money with which to carry forward its own work; has vigorously promoted 
the high school idea; has issued remarkable and original matter for the guid- 
ance of public speakers and the instruction of the people. 
In North Carolina the commissioner of public education has been enabled to 
carry on a propaganda for the local tax which has brought hundreds of school 
districts to the uplifting idea of self-help through the levying of the local school 
tax by popular vote. In harmony with this the Women’s School Improvement 
League has made a steady advance in improving the conditions of schoolhouses 
by means of decorations and various betterments. But over and above all this 
perhaps the crowning benefit to this State has been found in the erection of 
some thousands of new schoolhouses, modern in design and convenient in 
equipment. North Carolina has a little experiment now in progress that may 
well serve as an inspiration to other States. Several rural schools have had 
school ground under cultivation, not primarily for eduction, but for profit. 
Crops of cotton and hay have been raised and the terms have thereby been 
lengthened two or more months in the school year, and thus the communities 
in which they are located have seen a great light. This school agriculture 
pays, and pays well, and so, from an economic experience the farming popula- 
tion quickly learns the value of practical agricultural education and then the 
education follows. How much more valuable is an educational idea evolved 
from within and not imposed from without. My only purpose is to drop this 
hint in the hope that at the proper point in these proceedings Superintendent 
Joyner may give further information upon this general subject. 
In South Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky, and Alabama the women’s organiza- 
tions and work have been very specially powerful. The whirlwind campaign 
in Kentucky at the last Thanksgiving holiday was a powerful and potent force 
in the revival of the educational idea. 
The conference for education in Mississippi has been organized especially 
for the promotion of the normal-school idea. The conference for education in 
Texas has not only supported itself thus far by generous contributions, but 
has controlled and improved legislation and increased appropriation for educa- 
tion. It now has before it the large and important task of instructing the 
people concerning the great advantages secured by their own laws. Upon this 
interesting subject we shall hear from Mr. Clarence Ousley, of Fort Worth, 
Tex., the inspirer and leader of the movement, in the course of our deliberations. 
The unceasing agitation in Tennessee by means of meetings and conferences, 
under the guidance of the chairman of the campaign committee of the Southern 
Education Board, has brought about remarkable results. The beginnings of 
organized work in Arkansas and the quiet progress in Louisiana are also sub- 
jects of great interest. 
Each State has its own peculiar points of attractive study, as you will have 
noticed from the condensed detail just given concerning Virginia, North Caro- 
lina, and Texas. 
* * * * * * * 
The twelve years that measure the life of the Conference for Education in 
the South have been years of great originality in the development of American 
education. The American spirit in education has crowned our institutions of  
-P-A-G-E-68
  60 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910, 
higher education with many highly creditable developments for the general 
instruction of men and women and the creation of classes of scholarly special- 
ists. It has created by the communism of experience many progressive ideas 
in elementary and high-school education that haye brought vast benefits to the 
cities, but which are still denied to the greater part of the rural districts. 
It has, however, done more than this. It has taught us to so examine and 
understand our methods that, while appreciating all their merits and useful- 
ness, we shall also understand their great and glaring defects, look squarely 
at the conditions, discover why so much of our alleged education is practically 
no education at all in any true sense, when the preparation of the pupil for 
the facts of life are compared with the demands of daily experience. 
The discovery of these defects has brought out much research of causes and 
needs, which in their turn have developed enormous plans of improvement and 
have evolved clear ideas that act as light-houses to mark the channel of progress 
toward better things. 
Thus things have been found equally valuable with books as means of in- 
struction, and so industrial education has taken a great hold upon the educa- 
tional mind. But the educational mind needs much instruction upon industrial 
education. The phrase slips lightly off the tongue, but it has vast possibilities, 
knowledge of which may not be acquired by hasty glances at a carpenter shop 
or a printing office. Closely asociated with and indeed a part of industrial 
education is agricultural education, and again closely connected with this is 
the whole problem of rural life. The workshop and the soil should afford the 
most interesting opportunities of active, productive, and useful life. But they 
have been mainly the sphere for merely the “daily round and common task.” 
The old dreary notion of pious life would commend them to us as a “ means of 
grace,” while the better ideas of a progressive religion, taking account of 
science and of history, tell us they should be a “hope of glory.” And out of 
this agitation comes a vast impulse to find the way to higher things. We learn 
of the waste of our natural resources—our lands should produce three times 
their present crops; our forests should be protected and preserved; irrigation 
should be promoted, and the vast wealth already produced should be proven 
only a thriftless waste of the largeness bestowed by a bountiful Providence. 
It is only a short time since I learned in this State of a product of one and 
three-quarters bales of cotton per acre upon land in a neighborhood where half 
a bale to the acre was generally considered a good crop. So much for tilling 
the land with brains. 
Most significant is the recent National Commission upon Rural Life. The 
investigations and findings of this commission are now, or soon will be, acces- 
sible to every one caring to read them. But the center of study and action upon 
this subject has been and is the central Northwest. Wisconsin, Iowa, and Min- 
nesota have developed a surprising amount of practical and scientific knowledge 
that has so appealed to the imagination of our executive secretary as to lead 
him in the creation of his admirable programme to make “the keynote of the 
conference the improvement of conditions in the open country.”

This organization exists for the promotion of a universal civic spirit of edu- 
cation. Our institutions of higher and lower education will simply reflect the 
popular demand. In a democracy the people set the pace, evolve the standards, 
determine the quality of institutions. Schools from the kindergarten to the 
university will in their quality be simply responsive to the best intelligence of 
the people. With only the limitation of material resources the schools will be
-P-A-G-E-69
  
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. 61 
no better, no worse, than the people demand. ‘Therefore our efforts should be 
and are directed toward elevating the demand. 
The remarkable influence already apparent in the elforts of the Carnegie 
Foundation and the General Education Board working in complete harmony to 
standardize higher education will proceed by a long process through painful 
steps and slow to complete realization. But it will come. Incongruous col- 
leges will cease to call themselves universities. Alleged colleges, which are 
merely preparatory schools, will fall into proper place. Names will have a true 
yalue and a real meaning. Young women will not be satisfied with the review 
of so-called finishing at female seminaries, and young men will find out the real 
value of a diploma. When that time comes the value of accuracy and honesty 
will appear in education as in all other things. And so, as among men each 
takes his tone from the man next above, will our schools fall into line naturally 
and easily. But that good time is in the beyond. It is, however, great and 
beautiful to live in even the early glimmer of the dawn of better days. 
The attention of the present session of the conference centered very 
largely in the problems of agricultural education, a special conference 
being devoted to this subject, which was attended by 200 delegates, 
including representatives of agricultural schools and colleges, state 
commissioners of agriculture, representatives of the United States 
Department of Agriculture, state superintendents of public instruc- 
tion, presidents and secretaries of farmers’ unions, and others. The 
general topic for discussion was, “ What should be the nature and 
scope of agricultural education in the rural community?” 
The following is the substance of the principal resolutions adopted 
by the conference: 
1. That increasing attention should be given by state legislatures, public 
school officials, and teachers in all ‘schools to the extension of practical indus- 
trial training, including the essentials of agriculture and home economics, to all 
schools. rural as well as urban, elementary as well as secondary. Inasmuch as 
85 per cent of our population is rural, the general question of rural economy is 
of vital importance to all our people. We therefore especially commend the 
yarious agencies at work for the betterment of rural conditions and urge such 
coordination of these agencies that the unnecessary duplication of effort may be 
avoided. 
2. We recognize the imperative need of more efficient service in our schools, and 
to that end we recommend the broadening and strengthening of normal schools. 
and departments of education in colleges and universities, and urge the improve- 
ment of county supervision by requiring higher qualifications and by providing 
better remuneration than usually obtain at present. 
3. We recognize the work of local school-improvement associations and other 
voluntary cooperative bodies as a potent element in educational progress, and 
urge teachers and school officials to encourage the formation of such local 
organizations in all communities, urban and rural, throughout the States of 
the South. 
4, Recognizing the value of local initiative and local interest in school main- 
tenance, we recommend the enactment of laws providing for local taxation by 
districts, as the method by which state and county revenues for schools should 
be supplemented.

5. That this conference indorses the principle underlying the work of the 
General Educational Board, as announced by the president of the conference in 
his annual address, and expresses the conviction that it should be the aim and 
the policy of all philanthropic effort to initiate plans and constructive move- 
ments which shall be cooperative with existing institutions and recognized 
administrative agencies. 
The following officers were elected for the year 1910-11: Presi- 
dent, Robert C. Ogden, New York City; vice-president, Wickliffe 
Rose, Washington, D. C.; treasurer, William A. Blair, Winston- 
Salem, N. C.; executive secretary, P. P. Claxton, Knoxville, Tenn. 
GENERAL FEDERATION OF WOMEN’S CLUBS. 
The tenth biennial convention of the General Federation of 
Women’s Clubs was held in Cincinnati, Ohio, May 11-18, 1910. The 
activities of the federation are confined chiefly to the work of com- 
mittees, of which several relate either directly or indirectly to educa- 
tional work, as indicated by the committee reports noticed below: 
The chairman of the art committee brought to the convention an 
interesting collection of arts and crafts work accomplished by the 
mountain women of the South. The object of this work is three- 
fold: To provide remunerative work and to give a new interest in 
life to women in isolated homes; to teach them how to make articles 
of value and beauty; and to reestablish the old-time crafts. 
The economics committee reported that 871 clubs have home 
economics departments, that 258 clubs have helped materially in 
creating sentiment to establish home economics in public schools, and 
that 104 clubs have accomplished some educational or philanthropic 
work in cities. 
The chairman of the committee on literature and library extension 
reported that 495 clubs maintained traveling libraries and had sup- 
plied books to rural schools, hospitals, and sailors. Libraries have 
been established by 889 clubs. 
The chairman of the health department, civics committee, reported 
that during the past year many clubs had worked in support of 
school inspection, antituberculosis, sanitary school conditions, aboli- 
tion of the public drinking cup, traveling health libraries, etc. The 
plan of work suggested by this committee has been adopted in many 
States. Fifty clubs reported the need of outdoor schools; 38 clubs 
reported need of camps, sanatoria, or hospitals; 37 reported needed 
sanitary buildings and streets; 92 reported need of visiting nurses’ 
associations; 89 clubs reported need of antituberculosis associations; 
311 clubs reported the need of medical inspection in the schools. 
The chairman of the forestry committee reported that 266 clubs 
had provided lecture courses on forestry and were working to have 
elementary forestry introduced into the public schools.  
-P-A-G-E-71
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. 63 
The waterways committee of the general federation offered prizes 
to school children in many States for the best essay on “Inland 
waterways,” and in one State over 5,000 children have entered this 
contest. Conservation as a public-school study is favored by many 
clubs, and, with the cooperation of superintendents and teachers, 
efforts have been made to introduce it into the course of study. The 
state federations having waterways committees number 39. This 
subject was reported as having been introduced into 83 schools, and 
included in the arbor-day exercises in 45 States; 619 clubs reported 
themselves as interested in the subject. 
The report of the education committee of the federation was pre- 
sented by the chairman, Miss Laura Drake Gill, who reiterated the 
platform adopted for this department four years previously, as 
follows: 
Aim: That all children in the United States shall have equal educational 
opportunity. 
Principles: (1) Strong and well-enforced child labor and compulsory educa- 
tion laws in every State; (2) a sufficient number of well-equipped and well- 
cared-for schoolhouses in every community; (3) a properly trained and properly 
paid teaching force; (4) expert paid supervision of all school work; (5) train- 
ing for the hand and moral instruction in all public schools. 
The chairman called attention to the fact that— 
the formal resolution of the last biennial convention recommended some one of 
these five lines of work to each club interested in education, yet it did not nar- 
row the range to any particular interest. However, the special workers in edu- 
cation believed that greater results would be attained by more definite empha- 
sis; they therefore voted in special session that they would stress the fifth 
principle, “ training for the hand and moral instruction,” for the biennial period 
now closing. 
In preparation for the tenth biennial convention, the chairman of 
correspondence on education sent to the state federations a question- 
naire relative to the educational work carried on by the federated 
clubs in the respective States. The particulars to which the inquiries 
were directed are indicated by the topics in the following summary 
of the returns. It should be explained that the responses, as a rule, 
refer to directions of effort. An exception is the case of scholarships; 
the report under this head relates to funds actually contributed by 
the clubs. The clubs included in the report represent all the States 
excepting Arizona. 
Number of clubs in States, 5,356; total number of clubs replying, 
2,378.

At the educational conference of the federation there were discus- 
sions on out-door schools (where children are taught orally or from 
nature studies), humane work and humane education, the anticiga- 
rette movement, the congress of mothers, and kindergartens. The 
state chairmen of education from ten States made reports as to lines 
of school betterment in their States: 1. Kentucky had school-im- 
provement leagues doing effective work in 112 of the 119 counties. 
2. North Carolina emphasized special activity in introducing domes- 
tic science in the schools and the establishing of a chair of domestic 
science in the new Eastern Training School. Many parents-teachers’ 
meetings were also held. 8. Mississippi, under head of a school- 
improvement organizer, reported that scholarships are being en- 
dowed, training schools for rural teachers established ; that material 
improvement has been made in school houses and grounds, and that 
as a result of the introduction of the individual drinking cup and 
emphasis upon cleanliness the average school attendance in one 
school was increased 27 per cent. 4, Illinois reported vacation schools 
and one open-air school. 5. Minnesota reported that $1,800 had been 
raised by the club women for a loan fund to worthy girls. 6. Oregon 
reported the appointment of a club of women to act as sponsor to 
each country school, and that legislation providing for the use of 
school buildings as social centers of school neighborhoods had been 
enacted. 7. Wisconsin reported great activity in regard to industrial 
education throughout that State. 8. Maryland reported the appoint- 
ment of women upon school boards, also a county fund of $3,000, 
devoted to home economic interests. 9. New Hampshire reported 
the appointment of women to school boards, and a scholarship fund. 
Miss Juliet Stuart Ponits, who was awarded the English scholar- 
ship of the federation, will study economics and sociology at either} 
Oxford or Cambridge University, or at the London School of 
Economics.

LAKE MOHONK CONFERENCE OF FRIENDS OF THE INDIAN AND 
OTHER DEPENDENT PEOPLES. 
The Twenty-seventh Annual Lake Mohonk Conference of Friends 
of the Indian and Other Dependent Peoples met at the Lake Mohonk 
Mountain House, October 20-22, 1909. About 200 members were 
present as the invited guests of Mr. Albert K. Smiley. 
In the discussions, which are printed nearly in full in the report 
of the twenty-seventh annual meeting, considerable attention was 
given to the educational needs of the Indians, and in the Philip- 
pines, Porto Rico, Hawaii, and Alaska. The part of the platform 
concerned with education, adopted by the conference, is as follows: 
The ultimate end of all just government is self-government. Keeping this 
end ever in view, it is the duty of the nation to give to all under its author- 
ity * * * schools which shall furnish industrial and moral as well as 
academic instruction. * * * 
* * * Jt means for all—North American Indian, native races of Alaska, 
Porto Ricans, Hawaiians, and Filipinos— * * * adequate systems of edu- 
ication for their mental and moral development, and the improvement of their 
industries by providing industrial training. 
The officers of the conference were: President, Dr. Elmer E. 
‘Brown, United States Commissioner of Education; secretary, Dr. 
Charles F. Meserve, Raleigh, N. C.; business committee, Hon. James 
IS. Sherman, Vice-President of the United States, chairman. : 
Mr. Albert K. Smiley, in the closing remarks, spoke as follows 
concerning the continuance of the conferences: 
Now, we always expect to hold these conferences. The time will come when 
he Indian question will not require much attention, but probably the Philip-

pine question and the Porto Rican question will require attention for a long 
time; and there will doubtless be new problems needing discussion. Of course, 
I realize the limitations of life, and I am looking forward to the time when 
these conferences will fall into other hands. I feel sure in my own mind that 
they will be carried on just as well when I am gone as now, because my 
brother and his wife are deeply interested in them; they have children who will 
help them, and they also have a grandchild. This property will be turned over 
to them with the confident hope and expectation that this mountain top and 
this house will continue to be a center of influence in the elevation of the world. 
All this makes me feel very happy.     
              
     
              
     
                         
     
    NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE PROMOTION OF KINDERGARTEN 
EDUCATION. 
The National Association for the Promotion of Kindergarten Edu- 
cation was incorporated October 19, 1909. Its purpose is “ to foster 
the intellectual, moral, and physical training of children in the United 
States.” It proposes to do this— 
First, by urging kindergarten legislation in all the States where no provision 
has been made for public kindergartens; second, by sending thousands of 
printed articles on the subject to educational and civic gatherings; third, by 
supplying speakers competent to set forth the various phases of this important 
subject, and especially the importance of maintaining a high educational stand- 
ard; fourth, by the systematic use of the press; fifth, by cooperation with organ- 
izations looking to the betterment of living conditions. 
The following persons are members of the board of directors: Mrs. 
Roger C. Aldrich, Mrs. John D. Archbold, William S. Ball, Charles 
W. Bogart, Mrs. F. L. Cranford, Miss Cynthia P. Dozier, Horace

NATIONAL CONFERENCE COMMITTEE ON STANDARDS OF COLLEGES 
AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
As an outgrowth of two annual conferences of delegates from a 
number of associations, colleges, and preparatory schools in this 
country, the National Conference Committee on Standards of Col- 
leges and Secondary Schools was organized in April, 1908. The 
committee consists of delegates from the New England Association 0 
Colleges and Preparatory Schools, New England College Entrane 
Certificate Board, Association of Colleges and Preparatory School: 
of the Middle West and Maryland, College Entrance Examinatio 
Board, North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. 
Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of the Souther 
States, National Association of State Universities, and the Carnegi: 
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. The United State: 
Commissioner of Education is, ex officio, a member.

The committee assembled at Cambridge, Mass., October 9, 1909, at 
the call of President George E. MacLean, and adopted a definition of 
a unit for the measurement of admission requirements. (See p. 89.) 
It was voted that the committee record its approval of the tendency 
shown by many colleges to make their definitions of admission re- 
quirements conform to those of the College Entrance Examination 
Board, and that the committee make known its belief that it is highly 
desirable that the definitions of admission requirements published by 
that board come into universal use. 
The officers of the association are: President, George E. MacLean, 
State University of Iowa; vice-president, Wilson Farrand, Newark 
Academy ; secretary-treasurer, Frederick C. Ferry, Williams College. 
NATIONAL SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF INDUSTRIAL 
EDUCATION. 
The National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education 
was founded in 1906, its objects being, as stated in the constitution— 
to bring to public attention the importance of industrial education as a factor 
in the industrial development of the United States; to provide opportunities for 
the study and discussion of the various phases of the problem; to make avail- 
able the results of experience in the field of industrial education, both in this 
country and abroad, and to promote the establishment of institut‘ons for indus- 
trial training. 
At the third annual meeting of the association, held December 2-4, 
1909, the final report of the committee of ten on the relation of indus- 
trial training to the general system of education in the United States, 
was presented. The report dwelt largely with the nomenclature of 
industrial education. (See Standardization, pp. 95-96.) 
The following resolutions, submitted by the committee and adopted 
by the association, are here cited from Senate Document No. 516 
(61st Cong., 2d sess.) , in which the entire report is reproduced : 
1. Resolved, That the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Educa- 
tion at its meeting in Milwaukee respectfully transmit to the President of the 
United States, to the Vice-President and Chairman of the Senate, to the Speaker 
of the House of Representatives, and to the Secretary of the Interior, and to 
the United States Commissioner of Education, these two reports by a committee 
of ten members of this society upon the matter of industrial education. 
2. Resolved, That the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Educa- 
tion commend most earnestly to these high authorities of the Government the 
importance of this whole matter of industrial education from the standpoint of 
our national and economic welfare, and urge upon them the duty of an adequate 
consideration of this subject by those responsible for the national progress. No 
other factor in modern civilization requires closer study by those who lead the 
nations of this generation. 
8. Resolved, That the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Educa- 
tion earnestly recommend to the President and to the Members of the Senate 
and the House of Representatives the wisdom of an adequate appropriation to 
enable the United States Department of Education to undertake such a study as

that which is here suggested, and for that purpose the society respectfully re- 
quests that the President call upon the United States Commissioner of 
Education for an estimate of such sum as will enable him to undertake and 
carry through, within a reasonable time, the study here suggested. 
4, Resolved, That the officers of the National Society for the Promotion of 
Industrial Education are instructed to present these memorials to the high 
officers of the Government designated above in such form as may seem most 
fitting. 
The members the committee of ten, all of whom signed the 
report, were: Henry S. Pritchett, Paul H. Hanus, M. W. Alexander, 
E. J. James, Thomas M. Balliet, Leslie W. Miller, Charles S. Howe, 
William H. Maxwell, L. D. Harvey, and V. Everit Macy. 
The officers of the association for 1910 are as follows: President, 
Charles R. Richards, director of Cooper Union, New York City; 
treasurer, Frederick B. Pratt, New York City; secretary, Edward H. 
Reisner, 20 West Forty-fourth street, New York City. 
PLAYGROUND ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA. 
The Fourth Annual Congress of the Playground Association of 
America was held in Rochester, N. Y., June 7-11, 1910, with 250 dele- 
gates in attendance. The activities of the association comprise field 
work, including loans of photographs, cuts, lantern slides, and play- 
ground mouels, an employment agency for playground workers, and 
the publishing of a monthly magazine. The investigation of problems 
in connection with playgrounds is conducted by committees appointed 
at the successive congresses. 
At the meeting above referred to the committee on recreational 
buildings for large and small cities recommended that school build- 
ings be used for recreational purposes and that playground commis- 
sioners unite with civic clubs in the erection of new buildings. 
The committee on story telling reported a list of fifty stories suit- 
able for playground use and presented recommendations as to the best 
methods of conducting this feature of the work. 
At a meeting of the board of directors of the association it was 
decided that under the direction of the president and secretary of the 
association a number of local playground institutes should be held 
in different parts of the country during the coming year. 
The following officers were elected for the ensuing year: President, 
Joseph Lee, Boston, Mass.; treasurer, Gustavus T. Kirby, New York 
City ; secretary, H. S. Braucher, 1 Madison avenue, New York City. 
SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The twentieth annual session of the Southern Educational Associa- 
tion was held in Charlotte, N. C., December 28-30, 1909. 
The topics for addresses and discussion included moral and re- 
ligious education, relation of the college to the high school, agricul-
-P-A-G-E-77
  EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. e 69 
tural education, southern educational problems, future of the denomi- 
national college, education and business. A paper was presented 
showing the marked progress in the Southern States in respect to 
the improvement of public schoolhouses and reports from the differ- 
ent state superintendents indicated general progress throughout the 
section. 
Exhibits from a number of the public schools of the South, in- 
cluding different phases of manual work, drawing, pictures, etc., ex- 
cited considerable interest. Among the cities and towns so repre- 
sented were Asheville, Charlotte, and Durham, N. C.; Atlanta, Ga.; 
Charleston, S. C.; Birmingham, Ala.; Danville, -Va.; Memphis, 
Tenn.; and Hammond, La. 
Resolutions were adopted pledging the cooperation of the associa- 
tion in the movement for universal peace. 
The officer's elected for the ensuing year are as follows: President, 
D. B. Johnson, Winthrop Normal College, Rockhill, S. C.; first vice- 
president, Chancellor James H. Kirkland, Vanderbilt University ; 
treasurer, E. P. Burns, Atlanta, Ga. The secretary, Dr. H. Elmer 
Bierly, Chattanooga, Tenn., was elected at the Atlanta meeting, 1909, 
for a term of four years. 
SPECIAL COMMITTEES AND CONFERENCES. 
Important commissions, committees, or conferences, originating in 
the collective action of school officers, teachers, or societies, have been 
formed during the year in many States. Special notices of the fol- 
lowing have reached this office: 
California.—In accordance with a resolution adopted by the State 
Teachers’ Association of California, at its meeting in San Francisco, 
in December, 1909, a commission on industrial education was ap- 
pointed to investigate the conditions bearing upon industrial and 
technical education in the State, and to report, if possible, in Octo- 
ber, 1910. Mr. Harris Weinstock, a merchant, was invited to act as 
chairman of the commission and, in accordance with the authority 
conferred upon him, has appointed a truly representative body of 
associates which insures a full inquiry into all the interests concerned 
in the investigation. 
* Ohio.—The committee on resolutions of the Ohio State Teachers’ 
Association, at its annual session, June 28-30, 1910, presented a series 
of recommendations which were adopted by the association. The 
principal recommendations were as follows: 
The passage of a bill by the next general assembly authorizing the appoint- 
ment by the governor of a commission to collect facts concerning industrial 
education and training; to investigate the educational needs of persons engaged 
in the different industries, trades, and the agricultural, commercial, and 
domestic occupations of this State.  
-P-A-G-E-78
70 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
The encouragement of all efforts on the part of rural and village districts to 
make practical application of the sciences to agriculture; and provision for 
various forms of industrial education in the normal schools. 
The further lengthening of the tenure of office of the state superintendent ; 
compulsory supervision of rural schools; the supervision of plans for village, 
township, and special district schoolhouses, and for the remodeling of the same 
in the office of the commissioner of common schools; legal provision for an 
adequate system of state pensions for teachers. 
Under the belief that the Federal Government alone can ade- 
quately meet the present requirements for information that will 
enable public instruction to keep pace with the rapid advance of 
social and industrial demands, the association recommended that 
urgent efforts be made to secure an additional appropriation of at 
least $75,000 to the appropriation usually made for the United States 
Bureau of Education, for the maintenance of a staff of specialists to 
be employed in the first-hand investigation of present’ educational 
conditions and problems. 
Pennsylvania.—In order to secure uniformity in the efforts for 
promoting educational legislation, an educational alliance was 
formed in Harrisburg, Pa., May 26, 1910, by 50 men and women 
representing school boards, civic associations, and educational and 
professional associations in different parts of the State. The con- 
ference which resulted in the formation of this comprehensive alli- 
ance was called by the president of the State Federation of Women. 
The officers of the alliance are: Dr. Martin G. Brumbaugh, city 
superintendent of schools, Philadelphia, president; Dr. J. R. Flick- 
enger, Lock Haven, recording secretary. 
South Dakota.—At the annual session of the State Educational 
Association of South Dakota, held at Lead, November 1-3, 1909, the 
indorsement of the association was given to committees appointed by 
the Association of School Executives and the Association of County 
Superintendents for the following purpose: “ To consider and advise 
upon the revision of the school laws and the enactment of further 
laws looking to the improvement of the common schools.” At a joint 
meeting of the two committees, held in Sioux Falls, measures were 
agreed upon looking to the removal of the schools from the sphere of 
partisan politics; the creation of a school commission by legislative 
enactment, with an appropriation of at least $5,000 for the purposé 
of studying the school conditions and problems of the State, and in- 
vestigating the ways in which some of the older States have met and 
solved similar problems; the professional uplift of county and state 
supervision; the increase of the areas of school organization with a 
view to securing greater efficiency in the rural schools; the establish- 
ment of county high schools; provision of hygienic and medical in- 
spection of schools and school children.  
-P-A-G-E-79
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, CONFERENCES, ETC. 71 
The purpose of the committees to secure the largest freedom for 
the development of the means of public education in the State is 
especially indicated by the recommendation that all educational 
financial measures shall be freed from the limitations imposed by 
the necessary requirements of other appropriation bills. 
They declare in favor of laws similar in scope and character to those of the 
neighboring States of Nebraska, Minnesota, and North Dakota, and which have 
deservedly given their school systems an enviable reputation, which shall 
render state aid to rural schools and to high schools from funds derived from 
state-wide taxation and upon such conditions and limitations as to raise the 
standard of the schools, assist weak and struggling districts, and secure com- 
petent instruction for the agricultural and industrial arts and sciences in central 
schools. 
The chairman of the joint committee is Anson H. Bigelow, super- 
intendent of city schools, Lead; and the secretary, Dr. Franklin B. 
Gault, president of the University of South Dakota. 
Tewas.—At the fourth annual meeting of the Conference for Edu- 
cation in Texas, held at Waco, April 21-22, 1910, the following 
report of the committee on the recommendations made by the educa- 
tional commission and the executive board of the conference was 
submitted by Dr. F. M. Bralley and adopted by the conference: 
Whereas the educational interests of Texas are the paramount interests of 
the Commonwealth, the virtue, intelligence, and patriotism of the citizen guar- 
anteed through an efficient system of education being the only safe and per- 
manent basis of the peace, happiness, and prosperity of the people; and 
Whereas ‘Texas is making great and commendable progress in the develop- 
ment of her natural resources and her commercial possibilities, and great 
expansion and growth in both population and legitimate industry are taking 
place; and 
Whereas the conditions and times in Texas demand a marked advance and 
orderly improvement in the organization, the support, and the administration 
of the educational affairs of the State: Therefore be it 
Resolved, (1) That we indorse the recommendations made by the joint meet- 
ing of the board of regents of the University of Texas and the board of directors 
of the Agricultural and Mechanical College, to wit: (a) The extension of the 
term of office of the members of the two boards to eight years, two members to 
retire every year. 
(b) A special tax at a rate sufficient to raise revenues for the maintenance, 
building, and equipment needs of the Agricultural and Mechanical College, and 
the complete separation of the Agricultural and Mechanical College from the 
University of Texas. 
(c) Authority to the legislature to provide for the investment of the perma- 
nent funds of both institutions in such securities and other properties as the 
legislature may designate. 
2. That we recommend such constitutional amendments and enactments of 
statutory law as will provide for the support of the State’s educational institu- 
tions by a special tax. 
The adoption of this plan will not require an additional tax; it will simply 
change the method of support to a reasonable, just, and businesslike one.  
-P-A-G-E-80
  12 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
8. That we declare in favor of longer terms of office for superintendents of 
schools and for the governing boards of all state educational institutions and 
for all boards of school trustees, and the terms of the members of each board 
to be so classified as to prevent the retirement of the majority of any board at 
one time, and assert it as our belief that such a policy will give a better business 
administration of educational affairs and at the same time will protect the 
schools from the interference of factional politics. 
4, That we demand the submission of a constitutional amendment by the next 
legislature providing for the democratic principle of majority rule in the levy 
of local school taxes by cities that have assumed control of their public free 
schools. 
5, The country schools of Texas are in need of systematization and adminis- 
tration. While the average term of the country public schools of the State is 
about six months in each scholastic year, the statistics show that more than 
2,000 public schools are taught each year for a shorter term than five months; 
that several hundred schools are taught for a shorter term than three months; 
that more than 100,000 children of scholastic age are not annually enrolled in 
the public schools; that 397,000 children of scholastic age are daily absent from 
the schools while they are in session; and that the country children are prac- 
tically without high schools. 
As a conservative measure for the betterment of these unfavorable conditions 
and for the improvement of the country public schools we favor the establish- 
ment of a county board of education, to consist of five or seven members, to be 
chosen by the county at large by popular vote. The said county board of educa- 
tion shall be vested with the authority now lodged in the commissioners’ court 
with respect to public-school affairs, and shall, in cooperation with the district 
board of trustees and the county superintendent, promote the efficiency of the 
public schools of the county and encourage the establishment of county high 
schools wherever practicable. This proposition does not involve the abolish- 
ment of local boards of district trustees nor any change in the present manner 
of electing the county superintendent of schools.

INAUGURATION OF COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS. : 
Harvard University.—On account of the age and importance of the 
institution concerned, the inauguration of Dr. Abbott Lawrence 
Lowell as twenty-fourth president of Harvard, October 6, 1909, 
attracted much attention. Delegates were present from 31 foreign 
institutions and from 167 institutions in the United States. At the 
conclusion of the inaugural address, President Lowell conferred 
thirty honorary degrees. 
Dartmouth College—Dr. Ernest Fox Nichols was inaugurated as 
tenth president of Dartmouth College, Hanover, N. H., October 14,

IMPORTANT MEETINGS. 
Association of American Universities—The Association of Amer- 
ican Universities held its eleventh annual conference in Madison, 
Wis., January 4-5, 1910. This association is founded for the pur- 
pose of considering matters of common interest relating to graduate 
study. 
The discussions at the conference were grouped about the follow- 
ing topics: “The problem of the assistant professor,” a paper pre- 
pared on behalf of Leland Stanford Junior University by Prof. 
Guido Hugo Marx and presented by Prof. Charles H. Huberich; 
“University extension,” a paper presented on behalf of the Uni- 
versity of Wisconsin by Prof. Louis E. Reber; “ Position and im- 
portance of the arts course as distinct from the professional and semi- 
professional courses,” a paper presented on behalf of Princeton Uni- 
versity by President Woodrow Wilson. (For the report of the com- 
mittee on nomenclature, see page 94.) 
The officers are representatives of the following institutions: Presi- 
dent, University of Pennsylvania; vice-president, University of Wis- 
consin; secretary, Harvard University. 
The Association of Kentucky Colleges.—The Association of Ken- 
tucky Colleges is an incorporated body, which will hereafter hold 
meeting each December at Lexington, Ky. Two meetings were hel 
in 1909, in January and in December. Through a committee o 
accredited schools the association has been influential in securing uni 
form entrance requirements on the part of the colleges and universi 
ties of the association. 
The National Association of State Universities—The Nationa 
Association of State Universities held its fourteenth annual meetin, 
at Cambridge, Mass., October 8-9, 1909. Forty members were pres 
ent during the session. The guests were: James Bryce, British am 
bassador to the United States; Edwin E. Sparks, president of Penn| 
sylvania State College; Robert Alexander Falconer, president o 
University of Toronto. 
The University of South Carolina applied for membership and wa 
admitted. All the state universities are now represented in th 
association. 
The discussions, which covered topics of vital interest to the me 
bers, are printed in Transactions and Proceedings of the Nation:

Association of Presidents of Women’s Colleges in North and South 
Carolina.—The Association of Presidents of Women’s Colleges in 
North and South Carolina held its third annual meeting at Meredith 
College, Raleigh, N. C., March 30 to April 1, 1910. The leading sub- 
jects considered were: Better standards in secondary schools and col- 
leges; the use of certificates for entrance and for advanced standing; 
the amount and kind of work required for the B. A. degree; and 
health and exercise. 
Association of Collegiate Alumne.—The annual meeting of the 
Association of Collegiate Alumne was held in Cincinnati, Ohio, 
October 27-30, 1909. The report of the secretary shows that the 
association has 4,100 members in 47 branches. 
The report of the committee on corporate membership suggests 
that the time seems ripe to leave to other agencies the standardiza- 
tion of colleges in academic and financial matters, and to direct its 
efforts to maintaining suitable conditions for women in those insti- 
tutions which admit them. The committee therefore makes the fol- 
lowing recommendations regarding institutions which are to be 
admitted : 
1. There shall be a reasonable recognition of women in faculties and in the 
student body, and proper provision for the intellectual and social needs of 
women students. 
2. Much weight shall be given co the -act where women are on the board 
of trustees, especially in women’s colleges. 
3. In the consideration of a coeducational institution great weight shall be 
given to the fact that such an institution has a dean or adviser of women above 
the rank of instructor giving instruction and counted a regular member of the 
faculty. 
4, Women on the faculty shall receive approximately the same salaries as 
men of the same rank. 
5. No coeducational institution shall be considered in which there is not spe- 
cial provision, through halls of residence or in other buildings, for the social 
life of the women students. 
COLLEGE ELECTIVES. 
  The subject of college electives has been treated in several addresses 
delivered before important college and university gatherings. The 
attitude of the speakers toward this subject is indicated in the follow- 
ing extracts taken from their addresses: 
The middle of the last century saw the beginning of several intellectual move- 
ments. Natural science got under way earliest by establishing the doctrines of 
evolution and energy. The bearing of these broad principles soon became as 
necessary to our modes of thought as they were immediately recognized to be 
for our material development. To-day there is no branch of knowledge which 
has not in some wise been extended and enriched by the philosophical bearing
-P-A-G-E-84
  16 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
of these wide-sweeping laws which, at first, were the individual property of 
natural science. So intimately have they become the guiding principles of all 
modern constructive thinking, that, steer how he will, the man in college can 
not escape their teachings. Although these principles are still most signifi- 
cantly presented in the laboratories in which they arose, the student will as 
surely find their progeny in philosophy and history, in theology and law. 
The progress of half a century in the social sciences (history, economics, 
sociology, politics) has been of equal importance. ‘Though no such funda- 
mental and far-reaching doctrines as those of evolution and energy have there 
been discovered, yet social studies have become vital to the interpretation and 
upbuilding of modern life and service. 
What response did our colleges make to this revolution in thought, this 
sudden widening of intellectual and spiritual horizons, this modern renaissance? 
For a time practically none, for the curriculum was strongly entrenched in an 
ancient usage. Something called a ‘liberal education” was a kind of learned 
creed. The intellectual atmosphere outside the college grew broader, stronger, 
freer than in it. Forced by a rising tide, the colleges first made a few grudg- 
ing and half-hearted concessions, but still held for the most part firmly to their 
creed. The defenders could always point in unanswerable argument to the men 
of profound and varied talents who have been trained under their discipline— 
a discipline which all must freely admit has never been excelled. But times 
had changed, professional schools and real universities had come into existence 
in America, and more kinds of preparation were demanded of the college. 
Modern life in its vastly increased complexity had outgrown the straitened 
mold of a pedagogical and clerical curriculum. 
Finally, in an awakened consciousness, some colleges made the mistake in- 
evitable after too long waiting, and not only established the newer subjects in 
numerous courses, but took the headlong plunge and landed in an unbridled 
elective system. 
     
    
                                                                       Under this unhappy system, or lack of system, for every student who gains a 
distinct advantage by its license several of his less purposeful companions seek 
and find a path of least resistance, enjoy comfort and ease in following it, and 
emerge at the other end four years older, but no more capable of service than 
when they entered. Many another youth, neither lazy nor idle, but lacking both 
rudder and chart, angles diligently in shallow waters, goes no deeper than the 
introductory course in any department, comes out with many topics for con- 
versation, but no real mental discipline and but little power to think.—(In- 
augural address, October 14, 1909, Dr. Ernest Fox Nichols, Dartmouth College.) 
President Eliot pointed out with unanswerable force that the field of human 
imowledge had long been too vast for any man to compass; and that new sub- 
jects must be admitted to the scheme of instruction, which became thereby so 
large that no student could follow it all. Before the end of the nineteenth cen- 
tury this was generally recognized, and election in some form was introduced 
into all our colleges. But the new methods brought a divergence in the 
courses of study pursued by individual students, an intellectual isolation, which 
broke down the old solidarity. In the larger institutions the process has been 
hastened by the great increase in numbers, and in many cases by an abandon-| 
ment of the policy of housing the bulk of the students in college dormitories, 
with the result that college life has shown a marked tendency to disintegrate, 
both intellectually and socially. 
* * * * * * * 
If the changes wrought in the college have weakened the old solidarity an 
unity of aim, they have let in light and air. They have given us a freedo:
-P-A-G-E-85
  UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES—-HIGHER EDUCATION. 17 
of movement needed for further progress. May we not say of the extreme 
elective system what Edmond Scherer said of democracy; that it is but one 
stage in an irresistible march toward an unknown goal? We must go forward 
and develop the elective system, making it really systematic. Progress means 
change, and every time of growth is a transitional era; but in a peculiar 
degree the present state of the American college bears the marks of a period 
of transition. This is seen in the comparatively small estimation in which 
high proficiency in college studies is held, both by undergraduates and by the 
public at large, for if college education were now closely adapted to the needs 
of the community, excellence of achievement therein ought to be generally recog- 
nized as of great value. The transitional nature of existing conditions is seen 
again in the absence, among instructors as well as students, of fixed principles 
by which the choice of courses of study ought to be guided. It is seen more 
markedly still in the lack of any accepted view of the ultimate object of a 
college education. 
* * * * * * * 
If, then, the college is passing through a transitional period, and is not to be 
absorbed between the secondary school on the one side and the professional 
school on the other, we must construct a new solidarity to replace that which 
is gone. 'The task before us is to frame a system which, without sacrificing 
individual variation too much or neglecting the pursuit of different scholarly 
interests, shall produce an intellectual and social cohesion, at least among large 
groups of students and points of contact among them all. This task is not con- 
fined to any one college, although more urgent in the case of those that have 
grown the largest and have been moving most rapidly. A number of colleges 
are feeling their way toward a more definite structure, and since the problem 
before them is in many cases essentially the same, it is fortunate that they are 
assisting one another by approaching it from somewhat different directions — 
(Inaugural address, October 6, 1909, Dr. Abbott Lawrence Lowell, president of 
Harvard University.) 
Amidst the epidemic, now happily lyterian, toward the free and easy options 
of the extreme elective system, some of us have persistently denied that “all 
subjects are equally valuable,” and have held fast to certain disciplines as not 
exclusive, but as indispensable to the well-formed mind. We have refused to 
fall in line with that mischievous “scrap heap” educational fad which is now 
coming to be recognized as such even by many who until recently accepted it. 
Nor does this mean that I am not a believer in the fundamental idea of an 
elective system—namely, that of individuality and the cultivation of aptitudes; 
but that idea has found poor expression through the unscientific system, or 
rather lack of system, now so largely in use. Happily, we are in the midst of a 
salutary reaction against the excesses of the elective system. The pendulum 
is swinging back.— (Inaugural address, November 12, 1909, Dr. William Arnold 
Shanklin, president Wesleyan University.) 
There are some who are suspecting that the elective system has somehow gone 
too far and is unnecessarily complicating the problem of higher education. 
When we have every kind of knowledge quantified, we have the elective system, 
a system which is not totally unrelated in its fundamental character to the unit 
system. It may be, however, that the latter has within it the potencies which 
shall appear as the corrective of those limitations which have become glaring in 
the former. 
The tendency to telescope the academic and professional interests and to 
trade off even in the matter of credits marks a serious danger in higher educa-
-P-A-G-E-86
  18 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
tion. Here the unit system may become a great defense or it may be a means 
of destruction. Every one must recognize the necessity of shortening the total 
time of schooling for the individual, but if the mathematical unit operates in 
such a way as to fatten the youth in order to rob him later, we may call it 
more than a chance misfortune.—(Address before Association of Colleges and 
Preparatory Schools of the Middle States and Maryland, November 22, 1909, 
Prof. Edward F. Buchner, Johns Hopkins University.) 
The second task to which not only the individual universities but especially 
this National Association of State Universities must address themselves is the 
establishment of a curriculum for freshmen and sophomores in place of the old 
New England curriculum which has gone and the no-curriculum of the elective 
system, which experience has proved a worse substitute. I regard this matter as 
one of the most urgent problems now before our universities. It can not be settled 
for the nation by any one institution, but it can, I believe, be settled by this 
association, representing the universities of the several States. What we do in 
this matter, if we can reach a unanimous conclusion, would, I have little doubt, 
be adopted by the Nation. And think what vast interests are involved. It is 
nothing less than the displacement of the chaos which now reigns supreme, not 
only in our universities and colleges, but in our high schools and academies, by 
a curriculum of study based on sound pedagogical principles and adapted to 
the spirit and needs of twentieth-century civilization. I admit that the task is 
one of colossal difficulty, but that is no reason why it should not be undertaken. 
Difficulties exist to try the spirit of men. 
The general indifference of the faculties of our universities to this problem is 
due, I believe, to that exclusive absorption in departmental interests which the 
elective system has developed amongst us. The professor tends to look at all 
educational questions from the point of view of his own subject, his own classes, 
his own laboratory or seminary. A visitor from Mars investigating our uni- 
versities might suspect that students existed for the sake of the professor’s 
specialty. What studies are best for the student, and at what age? are themes 
seldom discussed and rarely thought of. Yet, in spite of research and 
in spite of service to the community, it is still true that universities exist for 
the sake of students. And the time has come for a reaction in favor of the 
student’s interests. We must face and settle the question what subjects should 
be studied by freshmen and sophomores, who, according to the formal declara- 
tion of this association, can not, like upper-class men and graduates, be left free 
to elect their own courses and to engage in specialization or investigation.— 
(President’s address before the National Association of State Universities, 
October 8, 1909, Dr. Jacob Gould Schurman, president Cornell University, 
Ithaca, N. Y.) 
The third cause for the declining numbers in the arts courses is one which I 
believe to have been very influential. I believe that the introduction and de- 
velopment of the elective system has had an influence only second to that of the 
commercial demand for technically trained men in reducing the interest in the 
arts course. It is interesting to observe that it is in the arts courses alone that 
the elective system is effective. Technical schools offer courses for the most part 
prescribed. Science courses are commonly prescribed. The student in the arts 
courses, in most colleges, is left very much to his own devices. * * * 
While there is no doubt that the demand for a new type of educated man 
has enormously increased the number of persons seeking collegiate education, I 
firmly believe that it was not simply a coincidence that the decline of the arts 
course set in about the same time that the elective system became thoroughly 
established, I am confident that the apparent indefiniteness and consequent

UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES—HIGHER EDUCATION. 19 
uselessness of the bachelor of arts course has deterred many male students from 
taking it. I believe, however, that it is quite possible to do much to counteract 
the evil effects of the elective system upon the arts course in Tufts College, with- 
out sacrificing the important principle whose recognition led to the establish- 
ment of the elective system. I am glad to say that this conviction is shared by 
the faculty, and that plans are now being prepared for a reorganization of our 
bachelor of arts courses, which it is hoped to put into effect with the beginning 
of the fall term of 1910. It is proposed to organize a considerable number of 
courses leading to the degree of bachelor of arts on the same general principle 
and with the same degree of definiteness as that shown in the scientific and 
technical courses. It is proposed to lay out a considerable number of courses 
in the School of Liberal Arts practically identical in the freshman year but di- 
verging thereafter, leading to preparation for law schools, for teaching, for 
journalism, for social service, for business, either directly or in preparation for 
admission to the Braker School of Business Administration, and probably ulti- 
mately for other occupations. Together with these the present course will be 
retained for the use of those who desire a culture course without distinct 
vocational training or who have not yet determined their vocation. It is claimed, 
however, that it will make the possibilities of the bachelor of arts course evident, 
that its usefulness as a vocational course will be made clear, and that the re- 
proach of vagueness and uncertainty will be removed from it. The essential 
principle of the elective system will be substantially retained. At the same time 
the control of education will also be retained in the hands of the faculty, and 
the School of Liberal Arts will come much nearer to educating its pupils than 
it has for the many years during which the tendency, less strong at Tufts than 
in many other places, has been not so much to educate the student as to allow 
him to get an education.—(Annual report to the trustees of Tufts College for 
1909-10, President Frederick W. Hamilton.) 
The faculty of arts and sciences of Harvard University at its 
meetings on December 14 and 21, 1909, adopted the following rules 
for the choice of electives, which will go into effect with the class 
entering in 1910: 
I. Every student shall take at least six of his courses in some one depart- 
ment, or in one of the recognized fields for distinction. In the latter case four 
must be in one department. Only two of the six may be courses open to fresh- 
men or distinctly elementary in character. 
II. For purposes of distribution all the courses open to undergraduates shall 
be divided among the following four general groups. Every student shall dis- 
tribute at least six of his courses among the three general groups in which his 
chief work does not lie, and he shall take in each group not less than one course, 
and not less than three in any two groups. He shall not count for purposes of 
distribution more than two courses which are also listed in the group in which 
his main work lies. 
The groups and branches are: 
1. Language, literature, fine arts, music. (a) Ancient languages and litera- 
tures. (b) Modern languages and literatures. (c) Fine arts, music. 
2. Natural sciences. (a) Physics, chemistry, astronomy, engineering. (6) 
Biology, physiology, geology, mining. : 
8. History, political and social sciences. (a@) History. (0) Politics, economics, 
sociology, education, anthropology. 
   
-P-A-G-E-88
  80 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
4, Philosophy and mathematics. (@) Philosophy. (b) Mathematics. 
The committee of nine appointed from the faculty to prepare general rules 
for the choice of electives was granted authority to arrange the various courses 
under the different groups and subgroups by agreement with the departments 
in which the various courses are given. 
II. Prescribed work shall not count either for concentration or for distri- 
bution. 
The committee was instructed in administering these general rules for the 
choice of electives by candidates for a degree in Harvard College to make ex- 
ceptions to the rules freely in the case of earnest men who desire to change at 
a later time the plans made in their freshman year, and to make liberal allow- 
ances for students who show that their courses are well distributed, even though 
they may not conform exactly to the rules laid down for distribution. In 
making exceptions to the rules, a man’s previous training and outside reading 
are to be taken into account. 
President A. Lawrence Lowell says the object to be attained by 
these new rules is twofold: “To require every student to make a 
choice of electives that will secure a systematic education, based on 
the principle of knowing a little of everything and something well; ” 
and further “to make the student plan his college curriculum 
seriously, and plan it as a whole.” 
MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS. 
Evening and correspondence courses at the University of Minne- 
sota.—Evening and correspondence courses have been established in 
the department of economics and political science of the University 
of Minnesota within the past year, chiefly for the benefit of business 
men and others interested in political and economic subjects. The 
evening courses for the first semester included: Principles of political 
economy, currency and banking, the public relations and regulations 
of business, current economic problems, and principles of accounting. 
Similar courses, consisting of 24 lessons each, were offered for corre- 
spondence instruction. 
University extension lecture courses are given by the department 
of economics and political economy. It is also proposed to establish 
extension courses in the school of education. Previous to the past 
year the University of Minnesota has not offered extension work 
except through extension lecture courses. 
Degree of associate in arts at Harvard University.—By a vote of 
the president and fellows of Harvard University, approved by the 
board of overseers at their meeting April 6, 1910, the degree of asso- 
ciate in arts is established in Harvard University. The courses ac- 
cepted for this degree will consist mainly of those of the summer 
school and the extension courses. The degree will also be granted to 
women by Radcliffe College. Neither an entrance examination nor
-P-A-G-E-89
  UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES—HIGHER EDUCATION. 81 
residence at the University will be required for the degree. The 
following rules were adopted: 
I. For the degree of A. A. a candidate is required to pass in studies amount- 
ing to the same number of courses as is regularly required for the degree of 
A. B., of which the equivalent of not less than five full courses shall be courses 
given by officers of instruction of Harvard University or by authority of Harvard 
University. 
II. Of these courses one shall be taken from each of the following four 
groups of subjects: 
1, Language, literature, fine arts, music. 
2. Natural sciences, 
8. History, political and social sciences. 
4, Philosophy and mathematics. 
III. Not more than five of these courses shall be elementary courses in any 
one department. 
IV. The administrative board of the department of university extension is 
directed to present annually to the committee on instruction of the faculty of 
arts and sciences a list of courses offered by Harvard University and the coop- 
erating institutions, to be approved by the faculty as acceptable for the degree 
of A. A. 
Educational conferences at the University of Vermont.—For the 
past five years the University of Vermont has held an annual educa- 
tional conference with the secondary schools of the State. The first 
of these conferences, held in January, 1906, was on English; the sec- 
ond in March, 1907, on the study of the classics; the third in 1908, on 
the teaching of mathematics; the fourth, in March, 1909, on the best 
methods of teaching the sciences, especially chemistry and physics; 
and the fifth, held March 10 and 11, 1910, was on modern language 
teaching in the schools. 
The conferences have been held in response to a desire on the part 
of teachers and friends of education for cooperation and leadership 
in educational progress, and the aim has been to bring expert advice 
to bear on some of the more important educational problems. The 
university, in this way, has also been able to render a service to the 
effort which is being made to improve, elevate, and unify the edtica- 
tional institutions of the State. 
The five conferences are reported to have been successful, and that 
on each occasion more than a hundred of the teachers in the secondary 
schools of the State were in attendance. 
Honor system to advance scholarship at Yale University—The 
question of raising the standard of scholarship and of raising the 
estimate of scholarly attainment at Yale University, has been under 
discussion by the alumni advisory board of the University during the 
past year, and has also been the charge of a special committee of the 
faculty.

-P-A-G-E-90
  82 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
The committee proposes the following scheme of honors in connec- 
tion with certain groups of courses which it is believed will be influ- 
ential in raising the standard of scholarship: 
Our proposition is to offer a limited number of honors groups, each embracing 
at least two related subjects. In these the work is to be prescribed for soph- 
omore and junior years, but left more or less elastic in senior year. One or 
more freshman courses would also be involved as fundamental and preparatory. 
The total amount of work called for in these honors courses would then aggre- 
gate about one-half of the total sixty hours per week, distributed through the 
four years, now required for graduation. In other words, the candidate for 
honors would still have left one-half his time for other elective work, except 
as this may be limited by the proposed requirement that honors students shall 
have a reading knowledge of French and German by the end of junior year. 
Of the honors courses, it is proposed that fifteen hours shall be embraced in the 
work of the sophomore and junior years. 
The scheme would be laid before incoming freshmen in outline, but the 
choice as to the definite-honors group would not be expected from the student 
till the end of sophomore year. The honors competition would be open to all, 
irrespective of previous rank, and the final grading would depend on the work 
in the honors courses alone. 
Two related subjects are called for in the scheme in order that the work of a 
given student may not be too narrow and specialized; but it is contemplated 
that in senior year it may be possible for the candidate for honors to devote 
himself more or less exclusively to one of the two subjects which he has pur- 
sued up to that point. The work of senior year would also in many cases be 
more free from the minor classroom restrictions than would be the case with 
the ordinary man. As examples of the grouping of subjects for honors courses 
thus far tentatively laid out may be mentioned the following: History and 
economics, philosophy and economics, Greek and Latin, French and German, 
physics and mathematics, chemistry and geology, chemistry and physics, and 
some others. 
While the plan is not yet complete, the subject has been repeatedly 
considered by the permanent faculty at its meetings since January, 
1909, and the expression of opinion is strongly in favor of developing 
the scheme and putting it into action as soon as practicable. 
Teaching fellowships at University of Wisconsin.—For the benefit 
of university graduates who expect to engage in teaching, the regents 
of the University of Wisconsin have established a number of teaching 
followships to be awarded each year to members of the graduating 
class. These fellows will devote half of the year to teaching in one 
ofthe city high schools of the State, under the supervision of the 
principal and teachers, and the other half to advanced study of the 
subject they wish to teach and to the study of pedagogy. Eight of 
the high schools of the State are cooperating with the university in 
this plan for training teachers. Six fellowships were awarded for 
the year 1910-11. 
Goucher College (formerly Woman’s College of Baltimore, Md.).— 
On February 2, 1910, the trustees of the Woman’s College of Balti- 
more, Md., changed the name of the institution to Goucher College,
-P-A-G-E-91

in honor of its founder, Rev. Dr. John S. Goucher, of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church. 
Reed College.—After a thorough investigation of the needs of the 
West, the trustees of the endowment fund of $3,000,000 left by the 
Jate Mrs. Amanda Reed, have decided to establish a college of liberal 
arts, to be known as Reed College. William Ladd has donated 40 
acres of land bordering on the Willamette River, within the city limits 
of Portland, for a campus. William Trufant Foster, professor of 
education, Bowdoin College, has accepted the presidency, and expects 
that the college will open for instruction in September, 1911. 
The American Society for Exutension of University Teaching. — 
The report of the board of directors of the American Society for 
Extension of University Teaching for the academic year 1909-10 
contains the following items: One hundred and twelve courses were 
conducted at 91 centers located in towns and cities in 7 States of 
the East, with an aggregate attendance of 165,199. Attention is 
called to the social service of the society in connection with the free- 
lecture systems at Atlantic City and elsewhere and the joint free- 
library courses of the American Society and the free library of 
Philadelphia. Eight syllabi were issued during the year. The re- 
ported membership for 1910 is 1,323. 
The officers of the association are: President, Henry La Barre 
Jayne: treasurer, J. Rodman Paul; secretary, Charles D. Atkins. 
Degree of doctor of public health established at Harvard Univer- 
sity.—At a meeting of the Harvard Corporation, held June 28, 1910, 
it was voted to establish a degree of doctor of public health, to be 
administered in accordance with the following regulations: 
1. The degree shall be known as “ doctor of public health.” 
2. Candidates for the degree of doctor of public health should first have the 
degree of M. D., or otherwise be properly qualified. 
83. Candidates for the degree of doctor of public health shall spend no less 
than one year in work upon a special subject and present a thesis containing 
some original research acceptable to the faculty of medicine, 
4, Candidates for the degree may be given credit for any course offered in 
any department of the university, provided it has the approval of the faculty 
of medicine. 
5. Candidates for the degree may be admitted to advanced standing. A mini- 
mum of one year in residence shall be required. 
6. The president of the university shall appoint three members from the com- 
mittee of full professors of the faculty of medicine, who shall constitute a “ com- 
mittee on the degree of doctor of public health.” It shall be the duty of this 
committee to consider all matters pertaining to the courses, admission to ad- 
vanced standing, and other matters concerning the administration of the degree. 
The committee on the degree of doctor of public health shall report its recom- 
mendations to the faculty of medicine.

IV. STANDARDIZATION OF EDUCATION. 
[See Report of the Commissioner of Education, 1909, Vol. I, pp. 92, 99.] 
During the year the subject of standardization of education has 
received considerable attention. The meaning of the term and the 
significance of the results are made clear in the following: 
CERTIFICATION OF TEACHERS. 
[See page 216.] 
Ilinois.—The Illinois education commission in its final report to 
the forty-sixth general assembly recommends a bill to provide a uni- 
form system of examining applicants for teachers’ certificates. 
Ohio.—The last Ohio state legislature passed a bill to provide for 
certification of teachers in the public schools. 
General—The following resolutions, which were adopted by the 
Conference of Chief State Education Officers held in Lincoln, Nebr., 
are to be presented at a larger conference of these officers to be held 
at Salt Lake City, Utah, November 17-21, 1910: 
That we recognize the state life certificate secured by uniform state exami- 
nation, subject for subject, which represents, in the main, scholarship and 
training equivalent to graduation from a four-year college course; provided, 
that the standard of the examination in the State where the certificate is issued 
is as high as that in the State to which the candidate seeks to be certified. 
That we favor the mutual recognition of state certificates based upon a degree 
from a standard college or university. A standard college or university is 
defined as one requiring for entrance a four-year high school course and for 
graduation a four-year college course of not less than 120 semester hours, in 
which shall be included not less than 15 hours of educational work. 
That we recommend the recognition of certificates based on the completion 
of a two-year course in standard state normal schools, for teaching in the ele- 
mentary schools; and the recognition of certificates based upon the com- 
pletion of a four-year course in like schools for teaching in secondary 
schools. By a standard normal school we mean a school requiring four 
years’ high-school work for entrance and in addition thereto two years’ work, 
including a thorough review of the common branches and one maintaining a 
well-equipped training school for observation and practice. 
It is the sense of the state superintendents at this conference that the con- 
ference be continued at another meeting to be held next fall at which the ques- 
tion of further deciding upon the question of interstate certification and other 
questions of educational work in which the States here represented are par- 
ticularly interested be discussed; that a committee of three, to consist of 
Superintendent Bishop, Doctor Updegraff, and Superintendent Schulz be 
appointed to prepare an outline of the subjects to be discussed; that the 
invitation of Superintendent Nelson, of Utah, for the conference to meet at Salt 
Lake City be accepted; that the committee be directed to especially invite 
state superintendents from as far east as Ohio and north of the Ohio River, 
and west-of the Mississippi River.

COLLEGE AND HIGH SCHOOL STANDARDS. 
The American Philological Association—The commission ap- 
pointed by The American Philological Association, and author- 
ized to formulate and to further the adoption of college entrance 
requirements in Latin, met in Cleveland, Ohio, October 29-30, 1909, 
and formulated the following college entrance requirements in 
Latin: 
: I, AMOUNT AND RANGE OF THE READING REQUIRED. 
1. The Latin reading required of candidates for admission to college, without 
regard to the prescription of particular authors and works, shall be not less in 
amount than Cesar, Gallic War, i-iv; Cicero, the orations against Catiline, for 
the Manilian Law, and for Archias; Virgil, Aneid, i-vi. 
2. The amount of reading specified above shall be selected by the schools 
from the following authors and works: Cesar (Gallic War and Civil War) and 
Nepos (Lives); Cicero (orations, letters, and De Senectute) and Sallust 
(Catiline and Jugurthine War); Virgil (Bucolics, Georgics, and Alneid) and 
Ovid (Metamorphoses, Fasti, and Tristia). 
I. SUBJECTS AND SCOPE OF THE EXAMINATIONS. 
1. Translation at sight—Candidates will be examined in translation at 
sight of both prose and verse. ‘The vocabulary, constructions, and range of 
ideas of the passages set will be suited to the preparation secured by the 
reading indicated above. 
2. Prescribed reading.—Candidates will be examined also upon the following 
prescribed reading: Cicero, orations for the Manilian Law and for Archias, 
and Virgil, Aineid, i, ii, and either iv or vi at the option of the candidate, with 
questions on the subject-matter, literary and historical allusions, and prosody. 
Every paper in which passages from the prescribed reading are set for trans- 
lation will contain also one or more passages for translation at sight; and candi- 
dates must deal satisfactorily with both these parts of the paper, or they will 
not be given credit for either part. 
3. Grammar and composition—The examinations in grammar and composi- 
tion will demand thorough knowledge of all regular inflections, all common 
irregular forms, and the ordinary syntax and vocabulary of the prose authors 
read in school, with ability to use this knowledge in writing simple Latin prose. 
The words, constructions, and range of ideas called for in the examinations in 
composition will be such as are common in the reading of the year, or years, 
covered by the particular examination. 
Brown University—The committee on college entrance require- 
ments of Brown University Teachers’ Association recommended that 
the association present the following petition to the authorities of 
Brown University: 
1. That the texts to be read in preparation for the requirement in Latin be 
four books of Cxsar, seven orations of Cicero (or six orations, if the Manilian 
Law be included), and six books of Virgil; or the equivalent of this requirement. 
2. That two years’ study of German or two years’ study of French receive the 
same credit for admission to college as is now given for two years’ study of 
Greek, 
8. That elementary Latin receive three points of credit for admission to college 
instead of two.

Examination Board was organized November 17, 1900. Its purpose 
was to bring about as rapidly as possible an agreement upon a 
uniform definition of each subject required by two or more colleges 
for admission; to hold, or cause to be held, a series of college admis- 
sion examinations with uniform tests in each subject; and to issue 
certificates based upon the results of such examinations. Each year 
the board issues circulars stating the places at which examinations are 
to be held, the names of the examiners, and the scope and require- 
ments of the subjects in which examinations are to be held. 
The examination board is composed of the following representa- 
tives of colleges, universities, and secondary schools named:

STANDARDIZATION OF EDUCATION. 87 
IL. 
A college or university may upon application be admitted to membership, 
provided that in the college applying for admission— 
(1) There shall be specifically defined and consistently carried out, whether 
by examination or certificate (or for the admission of special students), re- 
quirements for admission which shall in every case be equivalent to a four-year 
course in a college-preparatory or high school of good grade, able to prepare its 
pupils for admission to the colleges already belonging to this board. 
(2) The members of the faculty shall have an academic training adequate to 
maintain a high standard of teaching; they shall bear a proper proportion to 
the students to be taught, and shall be sufficient in number to permit of proper 
specialization in the subjects assigned to each individual instructor. 
(3) The breadth of the college curriculum, the standard of graduation, the 
grade of work, and the amount of work demanded shall be proper subjects of 
inquiry by the executive committee and shall constitute factors in determining 
their decision. 
(4) There shall be no preparatory department under the government or 
instruction of the college faculty. 
(5) There shall have been for at least three years preceding the application 
for admission an average of at least fifty students in the regular entering 
classes (courses in arts and in science to be reckoned together for this purpose). 
(6) There shall be a free income-bearing endowment, yielding in no case less 
than twenty thousand dollars annually, or in the case of state universities and 
colleges an equivalent annual appropriation from public funds, expended ex- 
clusively on the undergraduate department; as well as libraries, laboratories, 
buildings, and equipment adequate to maintain the degree of efficiency and the 
standard of scholarship contemplated in the above provisions. 
Til. 
Every college desiring to be admitted to membership in the board shall be 
required to file with the secretary at least three months before the stated meet- 
ing of the board at which action on the application is desired an application

executive committee for membership shall be communicated to the members of : 
the board at least one month before said stated meeting. 
  LY. 
Colleges shall be admitted to the board on a two-thirds vote of the executive 
committee confirmed by a two-thirds vote of the members of the board. 
‘Vs 
Representatives of the secondary schools shall be appointed in such manner 
as the association choosing them may direct by the New England Association 
of Colleges and Preparatory Schools, the Association of Colleges and Prepara- 
tory Schools of the Middle States and Maryland, the Association of Colleges and 
Preparatory Schools of the Southern States, the North Central Association of 
Colleges and Secondary Schools, and such other similar associations as may 
hereafter be recognized by the board. Each association may appoint one sec-

of the board and represented in such association, provided, however, that one 
representative may be appointed on the admission to the board of one such 
college or university, and provided, further, that the number of secondary-school 
representatives appointed by any one association shall in no case exceed five. 
Representatives of secondary schools may also be appointed directly by the 
board, to the number of five. 
A 
Annual dues of one hundred dollars shall be imposed on every college holding 
membership in the College Entrance Hxamination Board, said fees to be used 
primarily for the proper conduct of the examinations.

for admission to college: Botany, chemistry, drawing, English, French, geogra- 
phy, German, Greek, history, Latin, mathematics, physics, Spanish, zoology. 
x. 
The chairman of the board shall, with the approval of the executive com- 
mittee, appoint annually a committee of review, to consist of seven members, 
three of whom shall be representatives of secondary schools. This committee 
shall consider all criticisms and suggestions that may be made to the board in 
regard to its requirements, and shall make definite recommendations in regard 
to any modification of these requirements that may from time to time seem 
desirable. The committee may cooperate with committees of other bodies ap- 
pointed to formulate entrance requirements, or may, with the approval of the 
board, arrange for the appointment of such committees. 
XI. 
Not later than December of each academic year the board shali designate 
for each subject named in Section IX a college teacher to act as chief examiner, 
and one additional college teacher and one secondary-school teacher to act as 
associate examiners, and shall fix their compensation. It shall be the duty of 
the examiners so appointed to prepare examination questions, or other appropriate 
tests, in the several subjects, to be used at the annual examinations to be held 
under the direction of the board. When the several question papers or other
-P-A-G-E-97

National Education Association, department of secondary educa 
tion.—The department of secondary education of the National Edu 
cation Association, at a meeting held July 6, 1910, adopted th 
following resolutions: 
‘Whereas a wide range of high-school subjects is now demanded in view 0: 
the varied needs of society and the diversified interests of the differen 
students; and 
Whereas manual training, commercial branches, music, home-making scienc 
and art, agriculture, etc., when well taught and thoroughly. learned, are justl, 
entitled to recognition in college-entrance credits; and 
Whereas colleges in certain parts of the United States continue to requii 
two foreign languages of every applicant regardless of his own interests; and 
Whereas this requirement, in addition to such work in English, mathematic: 
history, and science as is essential to the high-school course of every studen 
precludes the possibility of giving adequate attention to these subjects: Ther 
fore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of this department that the interests of hig! 
school students would be advanced by the reduction of the requirements jj 
foreign languages to one such language, and by the recognition as electives 
all subjects well taught in the high schools; and be it further 
Resolved, That it is the sense of this department that until such modificatio 
are made by the colleges, the high schools are greatly hampered in the! 
attempts to serve the best interests of the boys and girls in the public schools.

STANDARDIZATION OF EDUCATION. 91 
New England College Entrance Certificate Board.—The New Eng- 
land College Entrance Certificate Board is composed of the following 
colleges and universities which admit students by certificate: Am- 
herst College, Boston University, Bowdoin College, Brown Univer- 
sity, Dartmouth College, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, 
Tufts College, University of Maine, University of Vermont, Welles- 
ley College, Wesleyan University, and Williams College. 
The following are the most important regulations governing the 
admission of schools:    
       
       
      
    
        
    
         
   
    
    
      
       
    No school will be approved unless it has shown by the record of its students 
already admitted to college its ability to give thorough preparation for college. 
A school shall be judged by the record of students who have entered college 
with the consent of its principal. 
Certificates coming from any school approved by the board and covering all 
the requirements for admission made by any college represented on the board 
shall be valid at such college, and certificates that do not so cover the entire 
requirements shall be treated by each college according to the rules which that 
college established for such certificates. No certificate from a school not ap- 
lproved by this board shall be valid for admission at any cooperating college 
unless the school lies outside the jurisdiction of the board. 
A general report of the work of pupils from approved schools for at least one- 
hird of their first year in college shall be made to the board, and such other 
‘eports as the board may require, and all complaints of insufficient preparations 
shall be made to the board with specifications as to subjects and individuals, 
ut such complaints shall not interfere with reports to the schools about students 
mtering from them. 
No school shall be approved for more than three years. The approval of a 
hool shall date from the first day of January of the year in which the 
pproyal is granted. 
North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.—At ‘ 
he fifteenth annual meeting of the North Central Association of 
‘olleges and Secondary Schools held at Chicago on March 25-26, 
909, the following report of the commission on accredited schools 
nd colleges was adopted: 
1. The standard American college is a college with a four years’ curriculum 
ith a tendency to differentiate its parts in such a way that the first two 
ears are a continuation of, and a supplement to, the work of secondary in- 
truction as given in the high school, while the last two years are shaped more 
nd more distinctly in the direction of special, professional, or university in- 
truction. For students who are not to enter professional or graduate schools, 
nd for those who are willing to lay a broader foundation for their professions 
an is laid by those who specialize at the end of the sophomore year in the 
niversity, the four years’ college work may be treated as a unit. For those 
hho have chosen their professions, the last two years in the best independent 
leges should provide ample opportunities for training preliminary to the 
irofessions. The independent college may thus become a cooperative university 
lege. 
2. The minimum scholastic requirement of all instructors shall be equivalent 
graduation from a college belonging to this association, and graduate work 
ual at least to that required for a master’s degree. Graduate study and  
-P-A-G-E-100
  92 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
training in research equivalent to that required for the Ph. D. degree is usually 
necessary, but ‘an instructor’s success is to be determined by the efficiency of 
his teaching and not by his research work. 
8. The college shall require for admission not less than fourteen secondary 
units, as defined by this association. 
4. The college shall require not less than twelve college units, or 120 semester 
hours for graduation. 
5. The character of the curriculum, the efficiency of instruction, the scientific 
spirit, the standard for regular degrees, the conservatism in granting honorary 
degrees, the tone of the institution shall be chief factors in determining 
eligibility. 
6. The college should be provided with adequate books in the library and 
laboratory equipment to develop fully and illustrate each course taught. 
7. The number of hours of work given by each instructor will vary in the 
different departments. To determine this the amount of preparation required 
for the class and the time needed for study to keep abreast of the subject, 
together with the number of students, must be taken into account. 
8. The college must be able to prepare its graduates to enter without con- 
ditions as candidates for advanced grades reputable graduate schools. 
9. No institution shall be considered for membership or retain membership, 
unless a regular blank has been filed with the commission, and is filed trien- 
nially unless the inspectors have waived the presentation of the triennial blank. 
10. The local inspector shall be the organ of communication between the 
college and the commission.    
    
    
    
   
    
            
   
            
   
      
    University senate of the Methodist Episcopal Church—The uni- 
versity senate of the Methodist Episcopal Church, which is charged 
with regulating and maintaining the educational standards of the 
schools and colleges of the church, met in Baltimore, Md., December 
15-16, 1909. 
This organization decided that after 1912 no institution of the 
Methodist Episcopal Church should be officially recognized as a col- 
lege or university which did. not require four years of preparatory 
work for the freshman class, four years of instruction for the bache- 
lor’s degree, and which did not possess at least six teachers giving all 
their time to college as distinguished from preparatory or professional 
work. And, further, that such institutions should have at least fifty 
students regularly enrolled in the college department and at least| 
$100,000 productive endowment. 
After the year 1916 there must be at least $200,000 of endowment 
in order to maintain college rank. 
The following resolutions were passed relative to reports of insti- 
tutions and to secondary schools: 
That in reporting the attendance in our colleges the board of education her 
after be requested to give only bona fide college students, and to see that insti- 
tutions having preparatory departments shall give the report of such depart: 
ments in the list of secondary schools and entirely separate from their colleg 
report. 
That it is the sense of the seaate that no secondary school under our auspic 
should be permitted to grant any academic degree.

That it is the sense of the senate that an institution shall be required to 
offer at least 12 units above grade work in order to be classed as an academy. 
FISCAL. 
Litinois—The Illinois educational commission in its final report to 
the forty-sixth general assembly recommended an amendment to the 
revised general school law to provide a uniform system of book- 
keeping by the township treasurers of the State and to secure prompt- 
ness in the inspection and auditing of their accounts. 
National Association of School Accounting Officers—The National 
Association of School Accounting Officers at their meeting in Wash- 
ington, D. C., May 17, 1910, appointed a committee on standardiza- 
tion of fiscal, physical, and educational data of school systems. The 
committee consists of Henry R. M. Cook, auditor of the board of 
education, New York City; William T. Keough, business agent, 
school committee, Boston, Mass.; and Charles P. Mason, secretary 
and treasurer, board of education, St. Louis, Mo. 
National Education Association, department of school administra- 
tion.—Following an address on “School reports and publicity,” by 
Dr. David Snedden, secretary of the Massachusetts state board of 
education, at the National Education Association, in Boston, July 6, 
1910, a committee was appointed to draw up resolutions expressing 
the sentiment of the department for good school reports and urging 
the United States Commissioner of Education to prepare a hand- 
book for the use of school administrators. 
The following committee was appointed: David S. Snedden, Bos- 
ton; George D. Strayer, New York City; Frank B. Dyer, Cincinnati, 
Ohio; R. G. Kinkead, Columbus. Ohio; and W. 8. Small, Washing- 
ton, D. C. 
National Education Association, department of superintendence.— 
The following resolution was adopted by the department of super- 
intendence of the National Education Association at the annual 
meeting in Indianapolis, Ind., March 1-3, 1910: 
That, because the statistics published in school reports are inadequate for the 
purpose of comparison, the president of this department is hereby authorized to 
appoint a committee of five to formulate and report at the next annual meeting 
of this department a system of statistics which will secure uniformity in reports 
in all points of common concern. 
The following committee on school statistics was appointed: Pay- 
son Smith, state superintendent of public schools, Augusta, Me., 
chairman; Charles M. Lamprey, head of the department of history 
and director of the model school, Boston, Mass.; William H. Elson, 
superintendent of schools, Cleveland, Ohio; E. C. Warriner, superin- 
tendent of schools, East Saginaw, Mich; George D. Strayer, professor 
of educational administration, Teachers College, Columbia Univer- 
sity, New York City.

NOMENCLATURE. 
[See Report of the Commissioner of Education, 1909, Vol. I, pp. 88-93.] 
Association of American Universities —At the eleventh annual 
conference of the Association of American Universities held in Madi- 
son, Wis., January 4-5, 1910, the following definitions were adopted: 
1. That the term group be restricted to a combination of related subjects. 
2. That the term curriculum be restricted to a combination of courses leading 
to a degree. 
3. That the term division be used to indicate any organic portion of a univer- 
sity which is larger or more independent than a department, and which does not 
adapt itself to classification under the terms already adopted by the association. 
National Association of State Universities—The following report 
of the committee on nomenclature of the National Association of 
State Universities was adopted October 8, 1909: 
1. That the term department be restricted to the various subjects taught in 
the university ; as for instance, the department of Latin, department of mathe- 
matics, department of physics, ete. 
2. That the term course be restricted to the subdivisions of a subject; as for 
instance, course 1 in English. 
3. That the term college be restricted to a part of the university, the standard 
of admission to which is the equivalent of that required by the Carnegie Founda- 
tion for the Advancement of Teaching,? and which offers instruction leading to 
a first degree in arts, letters, or sciences. 
4, That the term school be restricted to a part of the university, the standard 
of admission to which is not less than the equivalent of two years’ work in the 
college, and which offers instruction in not less than two years’ duration leading 
to a technical or professional degree. 
National Conference Committee on Standards of Colleges and 
Secondary Schools—The National Conference Committee on Stand- 
ards of Colleges and Secondary Schools held a meeting at Harvard 
University October 9, 1909, and adopted the following definition of 
a unit: 
A unit represents a year’s study in any subject in a secondary school, consti- 
tuting approximately a quarter of a full year’s work. 
This statement is designed to afford a standard of measurement for the work 
done in secondary schools. It takes the four-year high-school course as a basis, 
and assumes that the length of the school year is from thirty-six to forty 
weeks; that a period is from forty to sixty minutes in length, and that the 
study is pursued for four or five periods a week; but under ordinary circum- 
stances a satisfactory year’s work in any subject can not be accomplished in 
less than one hundred and twenty sixty-minute hours or their equivalent. 
Schools organized on any other than a four-year basis can, nevertheless, esti- 
mate their work in terms of this unit. 
  
“An institution to be ranked as a college must have at least six professors, giving| 
their entire time to college and university work, a course of four full years in liberal arts 
and sciences, and should require for admission not less than the usual four years of 
academic or high-school preparation, or its equivalent, in addition to the preacademic| 
or grammar school studies.

STANDARDIZATION OF EDUCATION. 95 
National Education Association—Report of the committee on the 
place of industries in public education to the National Council of 
Education—The report of the subcommittee on industrial and tech- 
nical education in the secondary school says: 
From careful analysis of the existing practices in secondary, industrial, and 
technical schools, and of the needs of this field of education, as evidenced by the 
testimony and expressions of opinions from a great number of educators, the 
committee has formulated the following definitions of three types of schools: 
A. The manual-training high school, or the manual-training school, is a school 
of secondary grade in which a greater or less amount of hand work is included 
in the curriculum and in which the greater part of the academic instruction is 
similar to that found in other high school and college preparatory schools, 
neither the manual nor the academic instruction being especially planned to be 
of direct vocational service. 
B. The secondary technical school, or the technical high school, is a school 
of secondary grade having the distinct purpose of preparing its pupils for indus- 
trial leadership—that is, for positions in industrial life requiring skill and tech- 
nical knowledge and of greater importance and responsibility than those of 
the skilled mechanics. In such a school the instruction deals not only with the 
important manual operations, but also with those principles of science and 
mathematics and their direct applications to industrial work that will help to 
prepare the student for successfully mastering the more fundamental processes 
and problems of those groups of industries which the school is designed to reach. 
C. The trade school and the preparatory trade school are schools which have 
for their definite purpose the preparing of boys or girls for entrance to the 
skilled mechanical trades and which deal with their pupils during a briefer 
course and allow for earlier preparation for practical work than the technical 
high school. Such schools place their greatest emphasis upon practical hand- 
work instruction under conditions resembling as closely as possible those pre- 
vailing in commercial practice. Such schools relate the academic instruction 
at every point closely to the practical work and include little that is not of 
direct bearing on trade work. 
National Society for Promotion of Industrial Education—The 
National Society for Promotion of Industrial Education adopted the 
following definitions December 2-4, 1909: 
1. Industrial education—This term should be used to mean training for the 
intelligent practice of any trade, including, of course, agriculture. It includes 
training in all the processes of a trade and in the theoretical foundations of 
that trade. It is intended to develop both industrial intelligence, and skill in 
the particular vocation. It does not properly begin until the pupil is at least 
14 years old. 
2. Industrial schools.—Industrial schools are those established with the pur- 
pose of training boys and girls, men and women, in industrial efficiency by 
means of industrial education. The purpose of such a school is therefore not 
general education, but specialized education, although at the outset the school 
may give a considerable amount of general trade experience, either in the shop, 
in the garden, or at the bench, together with related subjects like drawing, 
mathematics, history, or civics. An industrial school lays such a foundation 
in the essentials of a trade and the whole of it that, with subsequent practice 
and experience in his employer’s trade, the pupil may quickly become a skilled
-P-A-G-E-104
  96 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
workman, just as the student trained in the engineering school may become in 
the factory or in the field an engineer. The school gives not caly such 
acquaintance with the methods, tools, and materials which enter into the trade 
as will enable the student to do his work with a certain degree of facility, but 
it inculeates efficiency and workmanlike methods, careful habits, intelligent 
planning, 12nd economy and care in the use of important materials and tools. 
It does msre than this at its best, for it develops enthusiasm for work and 
broadens the field for progress with the trade and an appreciation of the 
possibilities of it. Under such a conception industrial schools are not a part 
of existing public schools, but a supplement to them, meeting a need which has 
arisen since the beginning of the last century with the evolution of the world’s 
industry and commerce. Their leading motive is vocational training, not 
general culture, and the efficiency of a school depends on its leading motive. 
The curriculum which such a school offers and the time which the course 
of study will cover must vary with the nature of the trade and the demands 
of the locality. Such schools are fundamentally local, serving the communities 
and the region in which they exist. 
For pupils admitted at the lower limit of age—say 14 years—the course 
would naturally be four years; for more mature pupils it may -be two or 
three years. 
3. Industrial continuation schools or industrial improvement schools.—Schools 
conducted under these names are industrial schools wherein apprentices or 
other persons already engaged in the industries may secure training for 
advancement in their several callings appropriate to their previous education 
and experience. Such schools have been conducted ordinarily at night, and 
where they are conducted as day schools, instruction should be so planned as 
to interfere as little as possible with the pupil’s work in the trade. 
4. Agricultural schools.—Agricultural schools are industrial schools whose 
main purpose is to train for the trade of agriculture. They are in fact agri- 
cultural trade schools as distinguished from the agricultural colleges, which, 
while in the past offering a certain amount of industrial instruction in agricul- 
ture, have, in the main, trained men for professional places, such, for example, 
as professors in agricultural colleges, workers in the Department of Agriculture 
and experiment stations, and occasional managers of large agricultural plants. 
The agricultural trade school can have no more relation to the agricultural col- 
lege than the trade school for training mechanics can have to a college of 
engineering. 
5. Manual training.—Manual training means training in the use of tools and 
materials so as to provide appropriate elementary training in a number of me- 
chanical occupations, but no specialized training in any one of them. It is an 
appropriate instrument of education at every stage of a pupil’s development, 
whether he subsequently learns a trade or not. It gives, if well done, general 
acquaintance with constructive and productive activities; it may also give to 
a pupil manual dexterity, and hence, if well done, may, among other things, 
prepare a pupil for specialized work in industrial education. 
6. Manual-training schools—Manual-training schools are schools for general 
education, like other academic schools. They serve to give pupils a high-school 
education, using manual training as one of the principal studies, and, like other 
high schools, may prepare pupils for professional training in some college or 
engineering school. This definition is applicable to the manual-training schools 
as they have hitherto existed and as they still exist. In the United States there 
are a few manual-training schools at the present day which may give elementary] 
industrial training.

ogy, Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, has com- 
pleted and published a standard for the measurement of quality in 
handwriting. 
V. PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
  
The most important movement affecting the public schools of the 
country at the present time has to do with economic conditions. It 
has taken two directions—one agricultural in its aim, the other in- 
dustrial; or, rather, the one rural, the other urban. These two di- 
visions of a common movement are the subject of special and separate 
treatment in the present report. The spirit of this movement, how- 
ever, is not wholly industrial, and does not exhaust itself in pur- 
poses that are mainly vocational. It manifests itself in the chang- 
ing conception of school activities in general; of their relation to 
life and to all the agencies by which individual character is shaped 
to the highest purposes of national existence. This enlarged concep- 
tion is signally illustrated by the recent change in the system of 
education of New York, which brought Hon. Andrew S. Draper into 
the position of state commissioner of education, to which office he 
was reelected on March 31, 1910, and by the recent measures for the 
reorganization of the Massachusetts system of education under the 
direction of Dr. David S. Snedden, appointed state commissioner of 
education on November 15, 1909. 
In the larger sense, the movement is not at present easy to define 
or to trace in all its course; but in this relation, isolated and even 
futile attempts at modifying established traditional school procedures 
become worthy of attention. It is this alone which gives significance 
to the following notes, relating for the most part to modifications 
made or proposed in existing high schools. 
REPORT ON HIGH SCHOOLS. 
A committee of the New England Association of School Super- 
intendents, Principal W. A. Baldwin, of the State Normal School, 
Hyannis, Mass., chairman, appointed to consider current discussions 
and criticisms of the high school, at a meeting of the association in 
1909 presented a report ae the recommendations cited pelone 
The committee premise: 
We have placed these recommendations under four general heads, viz: 
1. Standardization. 
2. Modification of curriculum.

-P-A-G-E-106
  
  98 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
8. Professional training of teachers. 
4. Method. 
As to the first, standardization, we would call attention to the fact that the 
chief criticism has to do with the standardization by the college, with which 
many would be quite willing to dispense. To your committee such college 
standardization seems very valuable, but needing to be balanced up by standardi- 
zation from two other sources, viz, the local community and the educational 
authority of the State. 
The community is already making itself-heard, and should be encouraged to 
continue its demands for practical education. In the State of Massachusetts 
the state board of education has designated certain schools whose graduates 
may be received into the state normal schools without examination, and it has 
influenced high schools somewhat through the visitation of its agents and 
through teachers’ institutes under their direction. It is fair to say that thus far 
little has been done by the state board of education in this State toward 
standardizing the high school. * * * In other of the New England States 
much more is done in this direction, especially in Maine. * * * Your com- 
mittee recommend, then: 
1. Standardization : 
(a) By colleges continued. 
(6) By community encouraged. 
(c) By State enlarged. 
The order here given indicates existing conditions rather than any recom- 
mendation of the committee. 
2. Modifications in curriculum: 
(a) Less emphasis upon classics. 
(0) More emphasis upon subjects having to do with the care and devel- 
opment of the body—physiology, physical training, and the 
physical side of industrial education. 
(ce) More emphasis upon subjects preparing directly for occupations. 
(d) More attention to civics, sociology, and political economy in con- 
crete, simple forms. 
(e) A course in practical ethics growing largely out of school and 
neighborhood conditions. 
(f) Continuation or high-school extension courses to meet the needs 
of the community for regular and irregular students. * * * 
3. Professional training for all teachers of high schools, a part of this train- 
ing to consist of practice in a school of high-school grade and one in which a 
modern curriculum is presented by modern teachers in accordance with modern 
methods. 
It may be said that if the first recommendation were fully carried out and 
we should have standardization of the high school by college, community, and 
State, then there would be no need for the second and third, as the curriculum 
would be properly modified and the training of teachers would be cared 
OTe op tanto, 
4, We recommend as to method that every subject shall be so presented as to 
become a very part of the student, leading to broader thinking, wider sympa- 
thies, and more noble living, even as he lives from day to day in the high-school 
home. 
BERKELEY (CAL.) PLAN OF SCHOOL ORGANIZATION. 
From a report to the board of education by City Superintendent 
Frank F. Bunker it appears that a plan for the reorganization of 
the Berkeley schools, with a view to providing class rooms in sufli-
-P-A-G-E-107
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 99 
cient number to meet the prospective growth of the high school, was 
introduced during the year 1909-10. 
The plan provides for three groups of schools: The high school 
proper, comprising the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth years; the second 
group, called the introductory high-school group, comprising the 
seventh, eighth, and ninth years; and a third group, the elementary 
schools proper, comprising all children of the first six years. 
It is proposed that the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades shall be 
assembled at certain schools “which shall be organized for work of 
this character; that the ninth-year work be no longer done at the 
high school proper, but at these centers; and that the other schools 
of the department comprise grades no higher than the sixth grade, 
the same to be feeders to the centers.” 
The grounds stated by Superintendent Bunker in support of the 
plan are as follows: “It gives a greater high-school capacity, it will 
increase the school life of the child, and it gives an opportunity for 
greatly increasing the efficiency of school work.” 
     
   
                         
       
   
   
           
   
          
         FRESNO (CAL.) JUNIOR COLLEGE. 
An act of the California legislature, approved March 1, 1907, pro- 
ides that the board of trustees of any city, district, or county in the 
State may prescribe postgraduate courses of study in their respective 
igh schools. Such courses must approximate the studies prescribed 
n the first two years of university courses. 
Under the provisions of this act two years of postgraduate work 
ave been added to the high-school course at Fresno. The new de- 
artment is to be known as the Fresno Junior College. The courses 
or the first year include mathematics, science, agriculture, English, 
oreign languages, history, economics, and technical work. The ad- 
ission requirements will correspond to those of the University of 
alifornia, and a certificate or diploma will be awarded to students 
ompleting the two years’ course. A tuition fee of $40 per year will 
e charged nonresident students. 
An annex to the Fresno High School building is in process of erec- 
ion which will provide accommodations for the new department. 
he college will open in September, 1910. 
LOUISIANA STATE HIGH-SCHOOL PRINCIPALS’ CONFERENCE. 
A conference of state high-school principals of Louisiana was held 
t Shreveport, La., January 12-18, 1910, for the purpose of observing 
lhe teaching of history and science as carried on in the Shreveport 
igh School, and of discussing the methods thus illustrated, as well 
s other problems of importance to the high schools of the State. 
ong the subjects covered by the discussion was that of teaching  
-P-A-G-E-108
  100 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
the “importance and care of the forests,” in connection with the sub- 
jects of nature study, geography, and botany. As a result of the 
discussion the following resolution was adopted: 
That we, the high-school principals of the public schools of Louisiana, do 
hereby indorse the movement to have “ conservation of our natural resources ” 
taught in the public schools of Louisiana. We will lend our influence, and will 
put forth efforts to have this subject introduced in the text-books to be issued 
in the future. We also pledge our support to have instruction in this subject 
given to the teachers of the summer normals and teachers’ institutes, and to 
promote the cause of conservation in every way possible. 
       
             
   
          
   
              
    
    
   CONTINUATION SCHOOLS IN BOSTON. 
Three schools of the continuation type were organized in Boston 
in the month of April, 1910. One for those engaged in the shoe and 
leather industry, another for employees in the dry-goods business, 
and a third in “ preparatory salesmanship.” A large room convenient 
to the business district was rented and equipped for school purposes, 
and a submaster in one of the elementary schools of the city was 
detailed to supervise the work. The expenses of the schools were 
borne in part by the Boston school committee and in part by business 
firms interested in the undertaking. 
The class in the shoe and leather industry began its sessions April 
5, meeting on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons from 8 to 5 o’clock. 
Instruction was given by employers and experts in the industry. 
The course of study included the production and distribution of 
leather, tanning processes, leather manufacture, recognition of kinds, 
grades, and comparative values of leathers, manufacture and classi- 
fication of shoes, commercial arithmetic, commercial geography, 
commercial correspondence, salesmanship, efficiency training. 
Classes for employees in the dry-goods business met on Monday and 
Friday afternoons from 3 to 5 o’clock, instruction being given by 
experts as in the case of the school for those in the shoe and leather 
industry. The courses of instruction follow: Fibers; cotton and cot- 
ton goods; wool, worsteds, and woolens; silk and silk fabrics; linen 
and linen fabrics; recognition and comparison of mixed fabrics; sim- 
ple tests for determining quality, coloring materials, and color preser- 
vation; mercerization; noninflammable fabrics; care of stock; com- 
mercial arithmetic; commercial geography; commercial correspond- 
ence; salesmanship; efficiency training. 
Two classes in preparatory salesmanship were established, one fo 
boys and the other for girls. In these classes the instruction wa 
given principally by one of the teachers in the public schools, wh 
was especially fitted for the work, and was as follows: Commercia 
correspondence, facility in oral and written expression, store arith. 
metic, sales-slip practice, sources of merchandise and its distribution. 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 101 
raw materials, textiles, penmanship, color and design, hygiene, prac- 
tical talks on the fundamental principles of success, salesmanship. 
Employers: bore the expense of instruction. 
An advisory committee of business men was selected for each of the 
schools and frequent visits were made to the classes. Mr. Thornton T. 
Appollonio, secretary of the Boston school committee, says of the 
schools: 
The principal feature of the instruction in all these classes is the practical 
talks and lectures, each one hour in length, given by men who have built up 
large business enterprises, and by skilled men in their employ. These lectures 
are stenographically reported, and have been published to some extent in trade 
papers, such as the Boot and Shoe Recorder, Shoe and Leather Reporter, and 
American Shoemaking. The instruction in salesmanship is of a more elemen- 
tary character and is not reported. 
The various lecturers bring large quantities of material to the classes for 
illustrating their talks. This material includes leathers, shoes, and fabrics in 
all stages of their manufacture. They also make considerable use of the black- 
board. 
All pupils have become members of the class through their own initiative or 
at the suggestion of their employers. They show a very remarkable interest in 
these talks and frequently spend their noon hour at the school studying the 
stenographic reports. Many have already visited manufactories to study 
processes, and members of the dry-goods course have spent many of their 
evenings at the textile exhibit in Mechanics’ Building. 
The members of the classes are required to write theses, which are always 
on file for the inspection of their employers. Those who satisfactorily com- 
plete a course will be granted a certificate of proficiency. 
It has not been considered wise for the present, at least, to establish any 
age limits for pupils attending these classes, except that no pupils over 18 
years of age are admitted to the classes in preparatory salesmanship. The 
ages of the pupils in the other classes range from 15 or 17 to 28 or 30. Some of 
the pupils are extremely well educated and are college graduates, but the 
majority have not graduated from high schools. Hach class is composed of 
from 40 to 50 pupils. The attendance averages about 98 per cent, and no 
disciplinary requirements are necessary. 
REVISED COURSE OF STUDY FOR NEW YORK STATE, 
The general features of the revised course of study for the 
elementary schools of New York State are indicated in the following 
abridgment of the address delivered before the Massachusetts 
Teachers’ Association, November 26, 1909, by Andrew S. Draper, 
New York state commissioner of education: 
The manual training movement has created schools that differ very little 
from our other secondary schools; they do not direct children toward the 
industrial life and they do not train workmen. The educational system of the 
country has discriminated against the work that is done by the hand, and 
therefore against the children of the people who work with their hands. 
There will be no cure for this until the work of the public elementary school 
is done more expeditiously, less fancifully, and more completely than it is now
-P-A-G-E-110
  102 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
done, nor until those schools are supplemented by a system of schools which 
will provide real instruction in the mechanical trades. 
Separate industrial and tax-supported schools in absolute articulation with 
and under the same management as the public schools was the plan enunciated 
by the New York State education department more than two years ago. It 
was without any conference with the labor leaders, but in the confidence that 
it was so logical and right that the interest of the working masses in their 
work, and particularly in their children, as well as their common honesty and 
patriotism, would impel them to accept it. 
We believe that very generally the courses in the aibrtantanee schools are too 
much prolonged, that the grades and the years are more than need be, that 
some unnecessary branches are included, and that some others are too much 
attenuated, and that there are often more grades of text-books than are desirable 
in the same branch. 
Therefore, we shall soon recommend an elementary course of study with but 
six grades, and normally occupying six years, instead of eight. in the confidence 
that it will be more, rather than less, educationally efficient. 
We would follow this great and universal elementary school system, so sim- 
plified and strengthened, with a system of secondary schools, which for the 
present and in our State shall be distinctly separated at the very beginning into 
three great classes: First, the present literary high schools; second, commercial 
or business schools; and third, general industrial or trades schools. 
The schools of the third branch are of immediate interest now. We propose 
that they occupy buildings that look like shops; that they be taught by skilled 
workmen who can teach, rather than by teachers with a little mechanical skill; 
that to a moderate extent they use books which are really germane to the work 
to be taught, but that their main instruments be machinery and tools; and that 
they be much more shoppish than bookish. We propose that these schools be 
of two general classes, namely, general industrial schools, training in general 
mechanics those who will work in factories with machinery and many other 
workmen, and trades schools for those who will own their own tools and work 
essentially by themselves. It is proposed that these schools be of a character 
which will be adaptable to almost any industrial conditions, and that wherever 
there are 20 or 25 boys or girls who want instruction in any vocation they shall 
have it; that these schools shall be open day and evening to accommodate the 
circumstances of as many as may be. 
We are not going to assume that the training of our industrial schools will 
make finished workmen any more than the training of our law schools makes 
finished lawyers. We are aiming at a surer fundamental English education for 
workmen and a mechanical training which will shorten the time required to 
make a good journeyman, and which in time will make a more intelligent and 
skillful mechanic than is promised in any other way. 
As to just how much has actually been accomplished: The law looking to 
such schools as a part of the public school system, authorizing the certificating 
of teachers and the approval of courses for them by the state education depart- 
ment, and assuring them the definite financial aid of the State, went into opera- 
tion a year and a half ago. Before schools could actually be opened the senti- 
ment in each city or large town had to concentrate, the funds had to be pro- 
vided through the ordinary financial machinery, teachers had to be secured, and 
buildings and equipment had to be arranged. But we have schools operating 
under this law in Albany, Buffalo, Gloversville, Hudson, New York, Rochester, 
Schenectady, and Yonkers. The public opinion of the State is strongly in favor 
of the movement, and it seems very certain to gather in volume and force very 
rapidly. Another year will see the organization of many more schools.
-P-A-G-E-111
  PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 103 
According to the new course the first six grades constitute the ele- 
mentary course and the seventh and eighth. grades the intermediate 
course. Commissioner Draper, in his annual report (1909) says 
that— 
as much of the present elementary course as has seemed feasible has been 
placed in the first six years. In the two years’ intermediate course the ele- 
mentary work will begin to differentiate. It includes arithmetic, history, Eng- 
lish, physiology, modern languages, and other subjects which have previously 
been considered in academic work. Certain work from the academic course, 
elementary in its nature, is brought down to the seventh and eighth in the place 
of nonessentials which have been eliminated. It also includes work specially 
adapted to prepare pupils for commercial and industrial courses in high schools 
and trades schools. 
By way of explanation the report says: 
It has not been claimed that the school years of a child are to be shortened 
under this course. Indeed, the school life of the child is to be lengthened and 
each year made more profitable. The changes authorized in the syllabus will 
not afford a short cut to academic or collegiate instruction. It is claimed, how- 
ever, that these changes in the fundamental direction of elementary instruction 
will save much of the time which pupils now waste. Essentials only are to be 
taught; these more thoroughly and intensively, and presented in that related 
order of the course where a child is able to get a more comprehensive grasp of 
the subjects. 
The execution of this plan will not involve friction or embarrassment of any 
kind in the present organization of our elementary school system. It does not 
involve any question of school buildings. It simply means that the superintend- 
ents and teachers shall substitute the new syllabus for the old and with the 
equipment which they now possess adjust their instruction to the new lines. 
If the progress of the work calls for additional preraration, service, or equip- 
ment, those in charge of these schools will meet the obligation and responsibility 
as they have met others in the past. 
It is stated here, as it has been previously stated, that no district or city is to 
be coerced in adopting this syllabus. It is submitted on its merits and in the 
firm belief that those schools operating under it will prepare their boys and 
girls for more efficient and profitable service. 
REVISION OF NEVADA HIGH-SCHOOL COURSES OF STUDY. 
A meeting of Nevada state high-school principals and representa- 
tives from the State University was held at Reno, Nev., January 
28-29, 1909, for the purpose of revising the state courses of study for 
high schools. An outline was completed embracing the following 
courses: Classical, science, general, agricultural, and commercial. 
At a meeting of the state board of education, February 4, 1910, the 
work of this body was indorsed and the courses of study adopted as 
revised. In adopting the course the following supplementary resolu- 
tions were passed by the board: 
That the state board adopts the unit of work as presented in this report—180 
periods of forty minutes, or its equivalent. 
That the state board agrees with the committee that uniformity of text-books 
for the high schocl is not desirable.
-P-A-G-E-112
  104 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
That any student who has completed a minimum of 15 units in any one of 
these high-school courses of study shall be granted a diploma of graduation. 
That the state board commends the view of the committee that a high-school 
teacher should not be required to teach more than six classes daily. 
That the state board of education requires every high school in the State of 
Nevada to provide for instruction in one or more of these courses. 
That in regard to industrial and kindred courses, these may be added as soon 
as the high schools need them. 
REORGANIZATION OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS, COLUMBUS, OHIO. 
In order to relieve the crowded condition at the North High School 
in Columbus and ultimately in other high schools, and to meet the 
increasing demands upon the upper elementary grades, the board of 
education of that city has declared itself in favor of the junior high- 
school system and has directed that the new Indianola School be 
organized as a junior high school. 
The system contemplates placing the seventh, eighth, and ninth 
grades in buildings by themselves, conveniently located as centers, 
and so organizing the work as to include all that is essential in the 
work of the seventh and eighth grades, including manual training 
and domestic science, and the first year high school as now organized. 
Under this plan the city school system will consist of: (1) Ele- 
mentary schools, six years; (2) junior high schools, three years; (3) 
senior high schools, three years. The length of the entire school 
course will not be changed. 
WILLIAM PENN HIGH SCHOOL FOR GIRLS. 
In September, 1909, the new building for the William Penn High 
School for Girls, of Philadelphia, was completed and opened for use. 
The building was erected to provide better facilities than were 
afforded at the Commercial High School for Girls, the work of which 
the new school will continue. The organization of the new high 
school and the courses of study in general were arranged in accord- 
ance with the preliminary recommendations of the committee of the. 
board of education on high school and commercial high school 
for girls. These recommendations were based upon a study of the 
methods employed in similar institutions in other cities, together 
with a study of local needs made by Supt. Martin G. Brumbaugh, 
and are as follows: 
That there be established five departments, to be known respectively as 
academic, commercial, library, sewing, millinery and dressmaking, and domes- 
tic science departments. That the pupils on entering the school be permitted 
to elect the course they desire to pursue, as is now done on entrance to the 
other high schools of the city. 
‘That the time to be devoted to these several departments of study be sub- 
stantively as follows: Academic, 65 per cent; commercial, 35 per cent; library, 
25 per cent; sewing, millinery, and dressmaking, 25 per cent; domestic science,
-P-A-G-E-113
  
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 105 
10 per cent, and the students electing the library or the sewing, millinery, and 
dressmaking course must also pursue the academic and domestic science 
courses, and the pupils electing the work of the commercial department must 
also pursue the academic study. “ 
That all the pupils in the school shall be required to take the work pre- 
scribed in physical culture. 
          
                                                              
    REVISION OF VIRGINIA HIGH-SCHOOL COURSE OF STUDY. 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction J. D. Eggleston, of 
Virginia, constituted a committee on the revision of the course of 
study for high schools, which entered upon its work in April, 1910. 
The courses of study as revised for three classes of high schools are 
as follows: Class 1, with a four-year course; class 2, with a three- 
year course; and class 3, with a two-year course. The high school 
of the first class shall offer 16 units of instruction (a unit is under- 
stood to mean a recitation of forty minutes, five times a week, for 
thirty-six weeks). The second-class school shall offer 12 units and 
the third-class at least 8 units. 
The minimum instruction proposed for each class of schools is as 
follows: 
First class: English, 4 units; mathematics, 3 units; history, 2 units; science, 
2 units; electives, 5 units. (Hlectives: Language, 4; mathematics, 1; history, 
2; science, 2; manual. arts, 4.) In laboratory work and in manual arts the 
eighty-minute period is required as the equivalent of the forty-minute recitation 
period. Second class: English, 3 units; mathematics, 2 units; history, 2 units; 
science, 2 units; electives, 3 units. (Electives: Mathematics, 1; science, 1; 
history, 1; manual arts, 3.) Wherever a foreign language is chosen as the 
elective in either a second or third grade school at least two sessions must be 
completed in this foreign language. Third class: English, 2 units; mathematics, 
2 units; history, 1 unit; science (physical geography three times a week; agri- 
culture twice), 1 unit; electives, 2 units. (Hlectives: Foreign language, 2; 
science, 1; history and civics, 1; manual arts, 2. Manual arts includes cooking, 
sewing, manual training, and drawing.) 
The committee on revision is as follows: Dr. Bruce R. Payne, pro- 
fessor of secondary education, University of Virginia; Prof. Algar 
Woolfolk, principal Greenesville County High School; Prof. Jackson 
Davis, state school examiner; Prof. Harris Hart, city superintendent 
lof schools, Roanoke; Miss Lula Andrews, State Normal School, Farm- 
ville; Prof. Charles G. Maphis, president state board of examiners; 
Dr. J. A. C. Chandler, city superintendent of schools, Richmond; 
(Prof. E. H. Russell, secretary state board board of examiners; Prof. 
. J. Heatwole, Harrisonburg Normal ‘School.

106 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
of Gen. H. H. Beadle, superintendent of public instruction from 
1879 to 1885. Mr. Beadle drafted the provision of the state constitu- 
tion which prohibits the sale of an acre of the lands set apart for 
common schools for less than $10, a provision which has since been 
copied by the constitutions of several States subsequently admitted 
to the Union. January 21, 1910, was generally observed as Beadle 
day in the schools of the State by exercises appropriately commemo- 
rating the service for public education accomplished by this founder 
of the state system. For twenty-five years General Beadle has been 
engaged in normal-school work, and at the age of 72 is still a member 
of the faculty of the State Normal School at Madison, S. Dak.

COMMERCE. 
THE BOSTON HIGH SCHOOL OF COMMERCE. 
[Compiled from information furnished by the head master.] 
The High School of Commerce is organized with six departments, 
namely, English, modern languages, economics, mathematics, busi- 
ness technique, and science. The heads of these departments are me 
of superior ability and acquirements, and are paid a correspondingly 
higher salary. 
The head of the department of economics has charge of all sub: 
jects dealing with business theory, such as commercial geography. 
local industries, economic history, etc. He consults with busine: 
authorities and makes himself acquainted at first hand with the busi 
ness conditions of the community, and arranges for special cours 
and talks by business experts not teachers by profession. Amon 
such courses are the following: Advertising, 15 lectures; local indus. 
tries, 20 lectures; railroad operation, 6 lectures; salesmanship, 6 lec 
tures; municipal government, 6 lectures. 
The head of the department of mathematics studies the method: 
and processes of mathematics in use in representative business hous 
so as to supplant traditional practices with more approved form: 
and collects typical problems peculiar to the businesses which thi 
students are likely to enter. 
The head of the department of business technique is a certifie 
public accountant, and has had ample experience in the accountii 
part of business to make him well able to train the young men in thi 
field. He studies contemporaneous practice and keeps his depa 
ment abreast of newer ideas.  
-P-A-G-E-115
DEPARTMENTS AND BRANCHES OF STUDY. 107 
The school committee, at an early period of the school’s develop- 
ment, invited to serve and caused to be organized a representative 
committee of twenty-five business men, which should advise the new 
school in its initial policies and guide its development. It has been 
one of the purposes of this committee to organize the vocational part 
lof the work, which could not be done except through the cooperation 
lof business houses. The school has sought to use the business house 
las the laboratory for practical work. Each summer efforts have been 
ade to secure employment for the students in business establish- 
ents where insight into practical conditions might be gained and 
eal standards of business efficiency met. During the summer of 
909, 50 per cent of the second-year class, 77 per cent of the third- 
ear class, and 70 per cent of the fourth-year class secured summer 
mployment affording them valuable practical experience. 
The following circular letter of Mr. Frederick P. Fish, chairman 
f the executive committee of the business men’s committee, indicates 
he character of the appeal for cooperation made to theebusiness men 
£ Boston : 
Dear Str: The High School of Commerce is now [fall of 1909] entering upon 
ihe fourth year of its existence. As a Boston man, you undoubtedly know that 
ie aim of the school is to secure commercial efficiency in its graduates. In 
ursuance of this end, a large number of pupils in the three upper classes have, 
the past, obtained summer employment in business houses. Last summer 65 
r cent of the young men in these classes were so employed. This experience 
rms an invaluable part of the business training which the school desires to 
live, supplementing, as it does, the theoretical teaching of the class room, 
We feel that the results thus far secured are highly encouraging; but we aim 
increase the efficiency of this feature of our work by forming an even closer 
mnection than now exists between the school and the business interests of the 
reyes 
Our plan in brief is as follows: We desire to secure 300 positions for summer 
ployment at a minimum wage of $2 per week. This limit is set to give the 
ys employed sufficient money to pay car fares and buy lunches. It is not 
sential that no higher pay shall be received, but wages are a minor considera- 
ion. The chief aim is to give the boys business experience. 
It seems to us that two or three summers spent in a position of this kind . 
ill make our graduates much more efficient and ready for immediate service 
ith any business house. We know of no other way in which the merchants 
Boston can more effectively show their interest in commercial education, 
d, at the same time insure the opportunity of securing intelligent and efficient 
ung men in the near future, than by agreeing to employ boys of the High 
hool of Commerce under those conditions and thus participating in their 
‘velopment. 
We desire to secure promises of positions for next summer as soon as possi- 
With this end in view, a representative from the school will call upon you 
the near future. 
Trusting that we shall receive your cooperation, I am, 
Very truly, yours, F. P. Fisu,

1, 1910. Papers were presented on the following topics: Dietetics. 
domestic science, sciences in relation to home economics, high-schoo! 
work, domestic art, and newer professional fields. 
The subject of child nurses called forth some discussion and 
committee was appointed to study the question with reference to it 
vocational bearing and to report at the next meeting. 
The association voted to hold a summer meeting in connection wit 
the National Education Association. The officers for 1910 are: Presi

COURSE IN COOKERY FOR NEBRASKA GIRLS’ DOMESTIC SCIENCE CLUBS. 
The department of public instruction of Nebraska has issued 
course in cookery for the use of the Nebraska Girls’ Domestic Science 
Clubs. The plan for organization and use of the course is as follows 
The girls form a club limited in membership to those who are especially inte! 
ested in the subject and who, without neglecting the regular school work an 
their home duties, can give a short but definite time each week to the work. 
president and secretary are elected to look after the executive work and to kee 
the records carefully. A teacher in the school who is interested in the wor' 
and in the girls becomes the adviser of the club. 
Meetings of the club are held once or, in some cases, twice a week, generall| 
from twenty to thirty minutes in length, and held at a time when it will n 
conflict with the school work. Monday or Tuesday after the close of school, 
at some time during school hours which does not conflict in any way with t 
school work, seems most convenient generally for clubs meeting once a week. 
A certain recipe or direction is taken for the work each week, and ea 
member tries it at her home. Two, four, or more members, or in small clu! 
all the members, are requested to bring results of their efforts to the next mee} 
ing for a special report, and all members are called upon to report results a 
make comparisons. Then a new recipe is taken, or a variation of the old o 
is tried for the next week. Thus during the year a definite course of study 
carried out. 
The outline is prepared especially for high-school pupils, but 
also adapted for the use of grammar grades and for older girls j 
rural schools. It is stated that the number of domestic science clu 
has so increased and that there is such a general demand for a cour: 
of lessons that the bulletin is issued especially to meet such needs.

ment of the Kansas State Agricultural College conducted a series of 
“movable schools of domestic science” in connection with some of 
the high schools of the State. The schools were equipped by the 
college and conducted for a period of one week at a place. They 
were for the benefit of high-school students. The forenoon sessions 
were devoted to lessons in cookery and the afternoon sessions to 
lessons in sewing. Schools were conducted at Beloit, Cawker City, 
Kirwin, Phillipsburg, Minneapolis, Hays, Garden City, Burlington, 
Harper, Howard, Fredonia, and other towns. : 
GIRLS’ HIGH SCHOOL OF PRACTICAL ARTS, BOSTON. 
The Girls’ High School of Practical Arts was opened in Septem- 
ber, 1907, and has for its aim “to develop womanly attributes and 
to train for distinctly feminine occupations.” 
The course of study comprises two departments, the academic and 
the industrial, and is arranged for a period of four years, with the 
following subjects of instruction: English, history, modern lan- 
guages, science and mathematics, art, household science, dressmak. 
ing, and millinery. 
During the first year the course is the same for all pupils, six 
periods per week being given to sewing and four to cooking and 
housewifery and ten periods to academic subjects. At the beginning 
of the second year the students elect either household science, dress- 
making, or millinery and devote to the subject ten periods a week, 
besides required work in the academic department. For household- 
science work two kitchens are equipped with utensils and accom- 
modate 24 students at a time, so that every day about 150 girls cook 
and the food is sold to the teachers and pupils at lunch hour. The 
money obtained pays the cost of materials. Meals are also planned 
and prepared by the students and served to invited guests. Heating, 
ventilation, plumbing, and general sanitation are studied in con- 
nection with the work in science. : 
A flat of six rooms is rented near the school for lessons in laundry 
work, cleaning, and general care of the house. 
ENGINEERING. 
COOPERATIVE PLAN OF INSTRUCTION AT UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURG. 
The University of Pittsburg at the opening of the fall term, 1910, 
introduced the cooperative plan of engineering instruction. Special 
arrangements were made with manufacturing establishments whereby 
students will serve as regular employees under the existing labor
-P-A-G-E-118
  
  110 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
laws and conditions four terms of three months each during their 
four years’ course. For such service they will receive the regular 
wages of student apprentices. “By this plan the student gets the 
usual theoretical course and in addition twelve months of practical 
work all in the space of four years, the school work being arranged 
so that successive groups of students will furnish continuous service 
to the employer.” 
It is claimed that the cooperative plan will enable the student to 
observe in detail the methods of production and the conduct of 
business, and that, consequently, he will be able to do his school work 
more effectively. That upon graduation he will be of greater use to 
his employer, and, further, that the money consideration received 
for his practical work will ordinarily be sufficient to meet the tuition 
expenses for the entire course at the university. Cooperative work 
may be done in connection with the courses in civil, electrical, chem- 
ical, and sanitary engineering. 
The courses in engineering are made up of eleven terms of eleven 
to twelve weeks each spent in school and four terms spent in the 
engineering industries of the Pittsburg district, making a total of 
fifteen terms’ work required for graduation. 
The schedule of work in the cooperative plan adopted is as follows: 
During the first three terms, the middle term, and the last three 
terms of the course all students of the same class are together in 
school, while during the rest of the time each class is divided into 
two sections, which alternate quarterly between school and practical 
work. Each section doing practical work is further divided into 
two sections in order to furnish continuous service in any particular 
kind of engineering employment and at the same time permitting 
each student to have a greater variety of practical work. 
CONSERVATION ENGINEERING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. 
In recognition of the widespread interest in the subject of con- 
servation, the regents of the University of Michigan at a meeting 
held November 4, 1909, established a six-year course in conservation 
leading to a degree of master of conservation engineering. The course 
as outlined is broad in scope and is comprised of subjects selected 
from other courses given in the university. 
The following are the subjects and hours proposed: Cultural sub- 
jects and language, 45 hours; law and political economy, 15 hours; 
mathematics and astronomy, 27 hours; physics and chemistry, 18 
hours; geology and mineralogy, 15 hours; biology, botany, zoology, 
and forestry, 20 hours; drawing and surveying, 21 hours; engineer- 
ing, 41 hours; elective, 8 hours; total, 210 hours.

   COURSE IN HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION AT UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
A course of lectures and practical demonstrations on good roads 
construction was given at the University of Virginia during the 
spring term of 1910. A limited number of free scholarships were 
offered for the benefit of citizens of the State who expect to engage 
in highway construction work, which were awarded upon recom- 
mendation of county boards of supervisors. The course comprised 
57 lectures and 27 practical exercises on construction of streets, county 
roads, and county bridges; surveying, leveling, and drawing; and 
road materials.—(University of Virginia Alumni Bulletin, April, 
1910.) 
JOURNALISM. 
University of Michigan.—At a meeting of the faculty of the Uni- 
versity of Michigan, held February 7, 1910, it was voted to establish 
a general course in journalism leading to the bachelor’s degree and 
a number of special courses for the benefit of those who desire to 
prepare for a particular kind of writing or a special department of 
the newspaper. The administration of the courses will be intrusted 
to a standing committee of the faculty, which will issue a special 
ertificate to students who, in covering the requirements for the 
achelor’s degree, complete a programme of studies approved by the 
ommittee. The courses recommended, with the number of hours, 
re as follows: 
General course: Rhetoric (16), practical newspaper work (8), English (10), 
‘oreign languages (16), history (24), government (12), economics (10), soci- 
logy (4), philosophy (3), law (2), science (2). 
Special courses: 1. For students who wish to specialize in history, govern- 
ent, and politics: Rhetoric (16), practical newspaper work (8), English (10), 
oreign language (16), history (24), government (12), economics (10), soci- 
logy (4), international law (4), law (6). 
2. For students who wish to specialize in economics and sociology: Rhetoric 
16), practical newspaper work (8), English (10), foreign language (16), 
istory (16), economics (24), sociology (12), law (6). 
8. For students who wish to specialize in reviewing and in dramatic art and 
usical criticism: Rhetoric (16), practical newspaper work (8), English (24), 
foreign language (24), philosophy (7), music or other arts (10). 
4. For students who wish to specialize in technical journalism: Rhetoric 
16), practical newspaper work (8), English (10), foreign language (16), his- 
ry (16), government (6), economics (20), sociology (4), law (6), science (4).

The committee recommends that the Michigan Daily and other student or 
university publications be utilized for practical newspaper experience.— (From 
the Michigan Alumnus.) 
Ohio State University.—At a recent meeting of the board of trus- 
tees of the Ohio State University, Harry Franklin Harrington was 
appointed assistant professor of English, with the understanding 
that he will give, in connection with his other work, certain courses 
in journalism. 
This work is being undertaken in response to a demand for specific 
instruction designed to develop proficiency in this profession.—(Uni- 
versity News-Bulletin, June 27, 1910.) 
Agricultural journalism at University of Wisconsin.—The course 
in agricultural journalism at the University of Wisconsin is designed 
to meet the needs of students who wish to become contributors or 
editors of agricultural journals or bulletins. The work includes lec- 
tures, practice in the preparation of articles of the various classes, 
editing, proof reading, reviewing, interviewing, preparation of spe- 
cial articles, etc., and practice in photography for the press.” 
A seminar in practical editing provides for conferences on editing 
and publishing, circulation, and advertising, with special reference to 
the Student Farmer, a local periodical. 
Journalism in other institutions—In addition to the above men- 
tioned, courses in journalism are now offered in the following list o: 
institutions: University of Ilinois, Urbana, Ill.; Indiana University 
Bloomington, Ind.; Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechani 
Arts, Ames, Iowa; University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kans.; Massa: 
chusetts Agricultural College, Amherst, Mass.; University of Minne:

   LIBRARY TRAINING. 
LIBRARY COURSE FOR TEACHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN. 
A course in library methods for teachers was given at the summe: 
session of the University of Wisconsin, June 27 to August 6, 191 
in recognition of an increasing demand in Wisconsin for teacher| 
who have a working knowledge of library methods. 
The subjects of the course included the elements of cataloguing; th 
simplified decimal classification; mending and care of books; keepin 
of records essential in school libraries, such as accession and shel 
list records; and the use of reference books, especially those mo 
valuable in school libraries.

LAW. 
ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN LAW SCHOOLS. 
The ninth annual meeting of the Association of American Law 
Schools was held at Detroit, Mich., August 25-26, 1909. 
The committee on pre-legal studies, appointed to suggest a pro- 
gramme of university courses for students preparing for the study of 
law, offered the following recommendations, which were adopted by 
the association:     
   
      
    
    
            
      
    
             
   First, that students devoting only two years to such work take English 
(rhetoric and composition), two years; Latin or Greek, two years; German or 
French, two years; mathematics or a natural or physical science, one year; 
history, including English and American constitutional history, two years; 
experimental psychology. 
Second, that students devoting three or four years to such preparation take, 
in addition to the above, courses in economics, political science, sociology, and 
other courses in history, philosophy, and the natural or physical sciences. * * * 
Courses in economics, political science, and sociology are strongly recom- 
mended because of their helpfulness to a thorough understanding of the law. It 
is believed, however, that their study should be in the main postponed until the 
third or fourth year of the prospective law student’s curriculum. 
The following officers were elected for the year 1909-10: President, 
John ©. Townes, University of Texas; secretary-treasurer, William 
R. Vance, George Washington University ; for members of the execu- 
tive committee, in addition to the officers named, George P. Costigan, 
jr., Chicago, Ill.; Charles H. Huberich, Madison, Wis.; Charles Noble 
Gregory, Iowa City, Iowa. 
DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF LAW AT HARVARD. 
At the meeting of the board of overseers of Harvard University, 
held on April 6, 1910, it was voted to establish the degree of doctor of 
law (juris doctor). This degree will be conferred upon all persons 
who— 
having already received a degree in arts or sciences, and having fulfilled the 
requirements for the degree of bachelor of laws in Harvard University, accom- 
plish one additional year of work under the regulations of the faculty; or who, 
having already received a degree in arts or sciences, and having been gradu- 
ated from any other law school approved for this purpose, accomplish the work 
of two additional years under the regulations of the faculty. 
The course of study will consist chiefly of elective studies open to 
students in the second and third years of their course. To be 
admitted as a candidate for the degree of doctor of law the student 
ust be qualified to enter the Harvard Law School as a candidate 
or the bachelor’s degree, and must have completed his course with 
igh rank.

FELLOWSHIP IN LAW AT UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN. 
The first fellowship to be offered in the law school of the Uni- 
versity of Wisconsin was established during the past year by a gift 
from Mr. Nathan Pereles, of Milwaukee. It will be known as the 
Nathan Pereles fellowship in law, and is valued at $250 a year. 
The faculty has decided to award it to some student of the second 
or third year class on the basis of high scholarship.—(University of

MEDICINE. 
AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. 
The sixty-first annual meeting of the American Medical Associa- 
tion was held in St. Louis, Mo., June 6-10, 1910. The most impor- 
tant educational event was the report of the council on medical 
education. The council is a permanent committee on education of 
the association and holds a special conference during the year. The 
sixth annual conference of the council was held at Chicago, IIl., 
February 28 to March 2, 1910, and was devoted to a discussion of 
medical education standards. Addresses were delivered by Dr. 
Elmer Ellsworth Brown, United States Commissioner of Educa- 
tion; President Henry S. Pritchett, Carnegie Foundation for the 
Advancement of Teaching; President Jacob G. Schurman, Cornell 
University; Dr. Victor C. Vaughan, University of Michigan; and 
others. The report of the council presented at the St. Louis meeting 
of the association is based on an extensive study of the problems of 
medical education, and consequently indicates to some extent the 
present status and the standards desired. A part of it is printed 
herewith: 
REPORT OF THE COUNCIL ON MEDICAL EDUCATION. 
To the members of the house of delegates of the American Medical Association: 
During the past year the second tour of inspection of the medical colleges of 
the United States has been completed and much additional data collected. 
From the fact that the medical colleges of Canada furnish so many medical 
practitioners to the various States and reliable information regarding them has 
been lacking, these colleges were included in the second tour of inspection, so 
that now the council has first-hand information regarding all the medical schools 
of the United States and Canada. Since the completion of the actual inspection 
work the reports regarding the various colleges have been carefully reviewed 
and compared, department by department, with a view of finding the average 
condition. Incidentally, a mass of other data received from reliable sources was 
found to corroborate the data obtained by the inspections. From this careful 
study of the conditions actually existing and with a view of the immediate needs 
of medical education, the following outline of the “ Essentials of an acceptable 
medical college” was prepared. Omitting from consideration a number of the

   utterly worthless medical colleges, this outline represents in the majority of 
points a line considerably below the average of conditions existing in all the col- 
leges of the United States and Canada. The outline is as follows: 
1. Strict enforcement of all standards and requirements, the college itself to 
be held responsible for any instances where they are not enforced. 
2. A requirement for admission of at least a four-year high-school education 
superimposed on eight years of grammar-school work, or the actual equivalent 
education; this to consist of 14 units as defined by the College Entrance Exam- 
ining Board and required by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of 
Teaching, 
8. AS soon as conditions warrant, the minimum requirement for admission 
should be enlarged to include at least one year’s college work each in physics, 
ichemistry, and biology, and a reading knowledge of at least one modern lan- 
uage, preferably German or French. 
4, A requirement that students be in actual attendance in the college within 
he first week of each annual session and thereafter. 
5. That actual attendance at classes be insisted on except for good cause, 
uch as for sickness, and that no credit be given under any circumstances for 
ess than 80 per cent of attendance on each course. 
6. That advanced standing be granted only to students of other acceptable 
olleges, and that in granting advanced standing there shall be no discrimination 
gainst the college’s full-course students. 
7. Careful and intelligent supervision of the entire school by a dean or other 
xecutive officer who holds, and has sufficient authority to carry out, fair ideals 
f medical education as interpreted by modern demands. 
8. A good system of records showing conveniently the credentials, attendance, 
ades, and accounts of the students. 
9. A fully graded course covering four years of at least 30 weeks each, exclu- 
ive of holidays, and at least 30 hours per week of actual work; this course 
should be clearly set forth in a carefully prepared and printed schedule of lec- 
lures and classes. 
10. Two years of work consisting largely of laboratory work in thoroughly 
quipped laboratories in anatomy, histology, embryology, physiology, chemistry 
inorganic, organic, and physiologic), bacteriology, pathology, pharmacology, 
erapeutics, and clinical diagnosis. 
11. Two years of clinical work largely in hospitals and dispensaries, with 
orough courses in internal medicine (including physical diagnosis, pediatrics, 
ervous and mental diseases), surgery (including surgical anatomy and oper- 
itive surgery on the cadaver), obstetrics, gynecology, laryngology, rhinology, 
hthalmology, otology, dermatology, hygiene, and medical jurisprudence. 
12. At least six expert, throughly trained instructors in the laboratory 
anches, salaried so they may devote their entire time to instruction and to 
at research without which they can not well keep up with the rapid progress 
ing made in their subjects. These instructors should rank sufficiently high 
have some voice in the conduct of the college. There should also be a suffi- 
ent number of assistants in each department to look after the less important 
tails. 
18. The medical teaching should he of at least the same degree of excellence 
obtains in our recognized liberal arts colleges and technical schools. 
14. The members of the faculty, with a few allowable exceptions, should be 
aduates of institutions recognized as medical colleges and should have had a 
ining in all departments of medicine. They should be appointed because of
-P-A-G-E-124
  116 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
their ability as teachers and not because they happen to be on the attending 
staff of some hospital or for other like reasons, 
15. The college should own or entirely control a hospital in order that students 
may come into close and extended contact with patients under the supervision 
of the attending staff. The hospital should have a sufficiently large number of 
patients to permit the student to see and study the common varieties of surgical 
and medical cases as well as a fair number in each of the so-called specialties. 
16. The college should have easily accessible hospital facilities of not less than 
200 patients which can be utilized for clinical teaching (for senior classes of 100 
students,or less), these patients to represent in fair proportion all departments 
of medicine. = 
17. The college should have additional hospital facilities for children’s dis- 
eases, contagious diseases, and nervous and mental diseases. 
18. Facilities for at least five maternity cases for each senior student, who 
should have actual charge of these cases under the supervision of the attending 
physician. 
19. Facilities for at least 30 autopsies during each college session (for senior 
classes of 100 students or less). 
20. A dispensary, or out-patient department, under the control of the college, 
the attendance to be a daily average of 60 cases (for senior classes of 100 stu- 
dents or less), the patients to be carefully classified, good histories and records 
of the patients to be kept, and the material to be well used. 
21. The college should have a working medical library to include the more 
modern text and reference books and 10 or more leading medical periodicals, 
the library room to be easily accessible to students during all or the greater 
part of the day, to have suitable tables and chairs, and to have an attendant in 
charge. 
22. A working medical museum having its various anatomic, embryologic, 
pathologic, and other specimens carefully prepared, labeled, and indexed, so that 
any specimen may be easily found and employed for teaching purposes. 
23. A supply of such useful auxiliary apparatus as a stereopticon, a reflecto- 
scope, carefully prepared charts, embryologic or other models, manikins, dum-| 
mies for use in bandaging, a Roentgen ray, or other apparatus now so generally 
used in medical teaching. 
24. The college should show evidences of reasonably modern methods in all 
departments and evidences that the equipment and facilities are being intelli. 
gently used in the training of medical students. 
25. A statement in which the college’s requirements for admission, tuition, 
time of attendance on the classes, sessions, and graduation are clearly set fo! 
should be given, together with complete lists of its matriculates and latest 
graduating class in regular annual catalogues or announcements.     
     
    
   
      
    
   
   
     
    
    
   
       
   
    
   DEFINITIONS OF A MEDICAL COLLEGE¢ AND A MEDICAL scHooL.? 
“An institution to be ranked as a medical college must have at least six (6 
professors giving their entire time to medical work, a graded course of fou 
full years of college grade in medicine, and must require for admission not les: 
than the usual four years of academic or high-school preparation, or its equiva) 
lent, in addition to the preacademic or grammar-school studies.” 
  
@This definition of a college is based on that given in the revised ordinances of th 
State of New York, and which also was adopted by the Carnegie Foundation for th 
Advancement of Teaching as their standard. 
> Based on the definition of the term “school,” adopted in 1909 by the Association 
American Universities.

By a medical school as differentiated from a medical college is meant a part 
of a university requiring for admission the equivalent of two years of collegiate 
work and which offers instruction of not less than two years’ duration, leading 
to the degree of doctor of medicine. 
Taking the above outline as a standard, although, as already stated, it repre- 
sents in most particulars a very low average of the conditions actually existing, 
the colleges were rated on a civil-service basis on the scale of 100. The data 
relating to each college were grouped under ten general heads in such manner 
that the groups would have as nearly equal weight as possible, each group allow- 
ing a possible 100 points (10 per cent), and the ten groups aggregating, there- 
fore, a possible 1,000 points (100 per cent). The ten heads under which the 
data were arranged are as follows: 
1. Showing of graduates before state boards. 
2. Requirements and enforcement of satisfactory preliminary education and the grant- 
ing of advanced standing. 
. Character of curriculum. 
. Medical school buildings. 
. Laboratory facilities and instruction. 
Dispensary facilities and instruction. 
. Hospital facilities and instruction. 
. Faculty, number of trained teachers, all-time instructors, especially of the laboratory 
branches and extent of research work.. 
9. Extent to which the school is conducted for properly teaching the science of medicine 
rather than for the profit of the faculty, directly or indirectly. 
10. Libraries, museums, charts, etc. 
DIRTY 
Those colleges receiving a rating of 70 per cent or above are listed in Class A, 
those receiving a rating of from 50 to 70 per cent in Class B, and those rated 
below 50 per cent in Class C, Class A colleges may be considered, therefore, as 
acceptable colleges, those of Class B as colleges which require certain definite 
improvements to make them acceptable, and those of Class C as colleges in 
which complete reorganization would be required to make them acceptable. 
Following the. first tour of inspection, the council was criticised in certain 
quarters for not publishing outright its classification of medical colleges, ‘That 
classification was not published, however, because the council desired to give 
a number of colleges which were contemplating improvements the opportunity 
to make good. The delay has been more than justified. Many colleges have 
secured additional facilities, numerous mergers have been brought about, and, 
on the whole, the situation has greatly improved. The general conditions as 
revealed by the first inspection, however, were given the widest possible pub- 
licity, so that at the present time any plea of ignorance of the demands of 
modern medicine is unworthy of consideration, and further delay in the presen- 
tation of a classified list would not be justified and would unnecessarily prolong 
the existence of low standards. 
With the knowledge that only about half of our medical schools are teaching 
medicine in an acceptable way, and with the power possessed by the majority 
of the state boards to determine what constitutes a medical school in good 
standing it would seem easily possible for the state boards, acting either inde- 
pendently or conjointly, to bring about a rapid improvement. * * * 
The council believes that the coming American standard will be: A four-year 
high-school education; a year or two in.the university laboratories of chemistry, 
physics, and biology; four years in the medical school, and a clinical year as an 
interne in a hospital. 
About two-thirds of the acceptable schools of the country have either already 
put into force the requirement of college physics, chemistry, and biology or will 
put this requirement into force this fall. This requirement is the one adopted 
by Germany, Great Britain, France, and all of the advanced countries of the

world. Medical educators agree that a thorough training in these branches is 
practically necessary to the student beginning the study of modern medi- 
DS Ry, 
Sixteen medical schools are now requiring as a minimum for entrance two 
or more years of work in a college of liberal arts in addition to a four-year 
high-school education. These colleges and the years when the requirement 
became effective are as follows:

Ten other colleges in their printed announcements have clearly stated their 
intention to require two years of liberal arts’ college work as their minimum 
standard of preliminary education for the session of 1910-11 and thereafter. 
These colleges are as follows:

The 21 following colleges either already require in addition to a four-year 
high-school course one year of work in a college of liberal arts, including courses 
in physics, chemistry, and biology, or have made definite statements in their 
printed announcements or otherwise that they will require that standard of 
preliminary education in and after the year given:

Twelve other colleges sent official notices to the council that an increase in 
requirements would be made. Six of these have since rescinded their action, 
2 have been advised by the council not to make the requirement at the present 
time, and 4 others have not made clear statements of the proposed increase in 
their printed announcements. 
At least 6 medical colleges have provided an optional fifth year of hospital 
work for which the degree of M. D. cum laude is granted. These colleges are: 
Boston University, School of Medicine. 
Indiana University, School of Medicine. 
Rush Medical College. 
St. Louis University, School of Medicine. 
University of Nebraska, College of Medicine. 
University and Bellevue Hospital Medical College. 
The deans of at least 25 medical colleges have stated that they have more 
internships each year than they can fill. For these schools, therefore, the final 
requirement of the American Medical Association’s “ideal standard,” namely, 
“A sixth year as an intern in a hospital,” could be easily enforced. 
From the fact that 47 medical colleges have adopted higher entrance require- 
ments it is interesting to note that 7 state examining boards have also adopted 
preliminary requirements in advance of a four-year high-school education. 
These are as follows:

There are several other States which are contemplating similar increases in 
their requirements in the near future. 
In conclusion, it should be said that although there is still much to be done, 
splendid progress is being made, and we can all look forward to the future 
confident that within a few years medical education and medical licensure in 
this country will be on a satisfactory basis.

The report of the council was referred to the reference committee 
on medical education and through that body adopted by the asso- 
ciation. 
The public-health education committee, which was created in 
accordance with a resolution adopted June 10, 1909, reported that
-P-A-G-E-128
120 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
they had given in the one year of their existence 2,250 lectures free 
from technicalities, had reached 102,575 people, and that many 
physicians, both men and women, have promised, through the com- 
mittee, to give gratuitous lectures during the ensuing year. A gen- 
eral idea of the nature of these addresses may be gained from the 
following subjects: 1. The cause and prevention of ordinary colds. 
2. The value of pure food and the physiology of digestion. 3. The 
chemistry and economic value of food. 4. The care of the food at 
home. 5. The relation of pure water to the public health. 6. Water- 
borne diseases. 7. The value of exercise and rest to the public health. 
8. The air we breathe and the value of ventilation. 9. Pure milk 
and infant hygiene. 10. The relation of the teeth to good health. 
11. The causes and results of eye strain. 12. How to instruct chil- 
dren regarding the origin of life. 13. The causes and prevention 
of deafness. 14. The hygienic management of nervous children. 
The committee endeavors to provide lecturers for women’s clubs, 
mothers’ and teachers’ organizations, Young Women’s Christian Asso- 
ciations, church and social settlement clubs, etc., on any of the above 
and other subjects. 
Dr. John B. Murphy, Chicago, Tll., was elected president of the 
association for 1910-11, and Dr. George H. Simmons, Chicago, was 
elected secretary. 
ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN MEDICAL COLLEGES. 
At the twentieth annual meeting of the Association of American 
Medical Colleges held in Baltimore, Md., March 21-22, 1910, the 
following amendments to the constitution were adopted: 
For the present Latin requirement of two years (4 points) there may be sub- 
stituted four years of either high-school French or German, or its full equiva- 
lent, provided a satisfactory examination is passed in the elements of Latin 
grammar. 
Each annual course must be of not less than thirty-two weeks’ duration 
instead of thirty weeks, as heretofore. This time includes examination periods, 
but does not include any vacation period. It was estimated that about two 
weeks would be consumed by examinations, leaving thirty actual teaching weeks, 
and on this basis the new curriculum is established. 
No college a member of this association will be permitted to employ a paid 
solicitor for the purpose of inducing the attendance of students, nor shall any 
college offer to anyone, either directly or indirectly, any reward or inducement 
for securing the attendance of students. 
The university matriculation certificate of the Association of American Uni- 
versities may be accepted as a minimum requirement for admission. 
The committee on medical education indorsed the combined bac- 
calaureate and medical course now given by many universities, and 
also the concentration plan of teaching. It recommended that there
-P-A-G-E-129
  
DEPARTMENTS AND BRANCHES OF STUDY. 121° 
be submitted at the next annual meeting a curriculum for the five- 
year medical course. 
The committee on curriculum recommended a 4,000-hour sched- 
ule, without any allowable diminution, the distribution of the hours 
among the subjects to be left to the authorities of each college. 
The officers for the ensuing year are: President, Dr. J. A. Wither- 
spoon, Vanderbilt University; vice-presidents, Dr. Horace D. Ar- 
nold, Tufts College Medical School, and Dr. Charles R. Bardeen, 
University of Wisconsin; secretary-treasurer, Dr. Fred C. Zapffe, 
University of Illinois. 
     
     
     
                                 
     
   
    
   REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE TO VISIT THE HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL. 
In their report, April 6, 1910, the committee appointed by the 
board of overseers to visit the Harvard Medical School made the fol- 
lowing suggestions: 
That the sole requirements for admission should be a bachelor’s degree from 
a recognized institution, or that the candidate should show that he has done 
work equivalent to that required by any recognized college or scientific school 
for a bachelor’s degree. 
That the class of special students who are candidates for a degree should 
be abolished, and every person admitted under the above requirements should 
come in without qualifications or disability of any sort. 
A student holding a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent who is an applicant 
for advanced standing should be admitted on producing a certificate of time 
spent in medical studies and satisfying the head of each department that he has 
passed a satisfactory examination in that branch of medical study. 
The report is signed by George B. Shattuck, chairman; J. Collins 
Warren, Alexander Cochrane, Henry H. Sprague, Luther D. Shep- 
ard, Henry Saltonstall Howe, William Lambert Richardson, Charles 
P. Briggs, and James C. White. 
MUSIC. 
MUSIC TEACHERS’ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The thirty-first annual meeing of the Music Teachers’ National 
ssociation was held at Northwestern University, Evanston, Ill., De- 
ember 28-30, 1909. There were eight regular sessions of the meet- 
ng. Reports of conferences on college music, public-school music, 
oice, piano, and harmony were read. The association has a member- 
hip of 489. The officers elected for 1910 were: President, Rosseter 
. Cole, Fine Arts Building, Chicago; secretary, Francis L. York, 
etroit Conservatory, Detroit, Mich.; treasurer, Ralph L. Baldwin, 
artford, Conn.

VII. RELIGIOUS AND ETHICAL EDUCATION. 
RELIGIOUS EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. 
The seventh general convention of the Religious Education Asso- 
ciation was held at Nashville, Tenn., March 8-10, 1910. The general 
theme of the convention was “ Church and education,” but while rec- 
ognizing the responsibility of the church in this matter, the associa- 
tion emphasized that of the home, as indicated by the following cita- 
tion from the declaration of principles adopted at the meeting: 
We affirm that no school or church or other organization can take the place 
of the home or can remove from parents their primary responsibility for the 
moral and religious training of their own children. While the swift social 
changes of the present day may change the occupations of the home and modify 
its mode of life, it must remain true that the finest result of family life is not 
bread winning but character building. Every attack upon the home is an attack 
upon the state and the nation. Whatever conserves the home as not merely an 
economic arrangement, but a divinely given instrument for religious education, 
calls for our heartiest encouragement and our united support. 
' We affirm that the great power of the press in this country should be more 
clearly recognized and utilized in the furtherance of moral and religious educa- 
tion. Publicity, already efficacious as a deterrent to that which is evil, is equally 
an encouragement to that which is good. The achievements of the church, often 
full of heroism, should be more fully set forth in the daily press, and the ideals 
and attitudes inculcated by religion should through the same channel be carried 
into the homes of the people. That some of the newspapers of our country are 
becoming increasingly sensitive to their moral responsibility and increasingly 
desirous for cooperation with all agencies for the moral uplift and enlightenment 
of the people is a cause for encouragement. But moral leaders have hardly 
begun to avail themselves of this agency. In the press of to-day there is offered 
to church and school an unrealized opportunity for spreading ideals through the 
nation and educating men and women to deeper conceptions of duty, character, 
and public service. 
The report of a commission of twelve on pretheological education, 
appointed at the previous meeting of the association, was presented 
by Dr. Shailer Mathews, dean of the Divinity School of the Uni- 
versity of Chicago, and was adopted by the department of theological 
seminaries. The memorandum of the report prepared by the com- 
mittee is as follows: 
1. Your committee attempted at first to draw up a complete curriculum for 
the four college years. Such a curriculum, however, was seen to be imprac- 
ticable on account of the different studies, number of hours, and other condi- 
tions required by the different colleges for their degrees. It seemed best, there- 
fore, to the committee to draw up a list of courses which are especially 
adapted to prepare men for work in theological seminaries. 
2. It has seemed advisable further to distinguish between two classes of 
courses: Those which seem absolutely essential in training for practical 
efficiency in the ministry (List A), and those which are highly important for
-P-A-G-E-131
  
RELIGIOUS AND ETHICAL EDUCATION. 123 
the development of the more technically theological efficiency of the min- 
istry (List B). 
It is the recommendation of the committee that the studies in List A be 
ursued by all students for the ministry,and that Course B be pursued by 
hose who wish to prepare themselves in the fullest degree for the philological 
nd exegetical studies of the seminary curriculum. In so far as the student’s 
ptitude and opportunities permit the committee would suggest that the studies 
in both lists be pursued. 
3. As regards the amount of time to be given to each study the committee has 
osen as its unit a course running three hours a week for an entire college 
ear. In colleges where a given study fills a different number of hours per 
eek the adjustment will be easily made. 
The committee further assumes that the total number of hours per week 
equired in a college will not exceed 15 or 16. 
The committee has deemed it best to leave a certain number of units free 
for electives, permitting more thorough study of such courses of the suggested 
‘urriculum as particularly appeal to a student. 
4. The student is advised to consider the instructor as well as the course. 
Im case a course is given by an inferior instructor the committee advises that 
student substitute for it some other course in the corresponding group in the 
ther list, or, if more advisable, even in some subject not suggested. It is the 
pinion of the committee that the influence of the teacher is as important as 
e material of a course.

home.” 
YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. 
The educational department of the Young Men’s Christian Asso 
ciation was established by the international committee in 1894 for thy 
promotion and supervision of educational work among the differen| 
associations. The establishment of such a department has made i 
possible for the committee to study the general needs of its speci 
classes of students, to organize and outline uniform courses of stud, 
and to exercise a general supervision over the work of the differe 
associations. 
The rapid advance under this department may be seen from tl 
following items taken from the Association Yearbook for 191 
There were 6,517 talks, increase over 1909, 1,590; 2,443 paid teacher: 
increase 240; 52,247 different students, increase 5,170; $661,000 e:

RELIGIOUS AND ETHICAL EDUCATION. 125 
The educational activities of the different associations may be listed 
under the following headings: Reading rooms and libraries, lecture 
courses, educational clubs, evening schools and in some places day 
schools, summer schools for boys and adults, and schools to train for 
association work. The courses of study, as is shown by the list of 
subjects for examination, include the modern languages, science, in- 
dustrial and commercial subjects, and in some associations the ele- 
mentary subjects of the public schools, 
NATIONAL TRAINING SCHOOL FOR THE YOUNG WOMEN’S 
CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. 
The training system of the Young Women’s Christian Association 
for secretaries and other officers is extending and assuming more and 
more systematic form. The preparatory work is given in training 
centers and the professional training in the National Training School 
which was opened by the National Board of the Young Women’s 
Christian Associations in New York, September, 1908. 
ADDITIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. 
Among additional organizations engaged in the promotion of re- 
ligious and moral education may be mentioned the following: 
The Moral Education Board, which has recently given special at- 
tention to the moral instruction of children by means of illustrated 
lessons. The chairman of the executive committee of the board is 
Mr. Bernard R. Baker. The offices are at 903 Calvert Building, 
Baltimore, Md. 
The National Vacation Bible School Association, which was formed 
“to promote college and church ministry to children of the cities by 
establishing daily vacation Bible schools, and by securing the services 
of trained men and women adapted to such ministry.” The move- 
ment had its origin in New York City in 1901, when five church 
buildings of the New York Baptist City Mission were opened daily 
in July and August for the instruction of neighborhood children by 
college students. The number of schools subsequently increased in 
New York and similar schools were opened in other cities. In 1907 
the national association was organized, with headquarters at Bible 
‘House, New York City. 
From a report of the association for 1909 it appears that there 
were 90 daily vacation Bible schools under the direction of the na- 
tional association and other organizations, and that during the sum- 
mer vacation 27,000 boys and girls were enrolled. These schools were 
open to all creeds and were conducted in 11 cities. In 51 of the 
schools, under direct supervision of the national association, 209 
college men and women were employed.  
-P-A-G-E-134
  126 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
The principal officers of the association for the present year are: 
Dr. Leighton Parks, New York City, president; J. Adams Brown, 
president New Netherlands Bank, New York City, treasurer; and 
Robert G. Boville, Bible House, New York City, national director. 
The American Ethical Union held its third annual session of the 
Summer School of Ethics at Madison, Wis., June 27 to August 5, 
1910. Courses of lectures were delivered on principles of moral 
education, ethics of great poets, social movements and social service, 
the ethical movement, ideals and methods of ethics teaching, and 
ethics of great religions. There were also evening lectures and con- 
ferences, in all comprising about 100 lectures and conferences. The 
previous sessions of the school have been held at the University of 
Wisconsin. 
The officers of the school are: Dr. Felix Adler, New York City, 
dean of faculty of lecturers; Mrs. Anna Garlin Spencer, New York 
City, director; and Mr. Alexander M. Bing, New York City, 
treasurer. * 
VIIL COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES. 
THE POLICY IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
As regards the coeducation of the sexes in the public schools of the 
United States the situation remains practically unchanged from year 
to year, although occasional experiments at what is technically 
termed segregation serve to keep the subject before public attention. 
Throughout the country the elementary public schools are coedu- 
cational, with the exception of a few schools in cities on the Atlantic 
seaboard, in which free public schools were first established for boys 
only, and the subsequent demand for similar provision for girls was 
necessarily met by new buildings and accommodations. This 
arrangement affects but a small proportion—not above 4 per cent— 
of the pupils enrolled in elementary schools. 
Separate high schools have long been maintained in Boston (the 
old city), New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, and 
New Orleans. In the West the high schools universally followed 
the course of the elementary schools in this respect until a very 
recent date. An experiment in segregating the boys and girls, dur- 
ing the first two years of the high-school course, cautiously made 
about four years ago by Principal Armstrong, of the Englewood 
High School, Chicago, has not only attracted wide attention, but 
has been followed in several other high schools, hence it may be said 
to represent a tendency of more than passing importance.
-P-A-G-E-135
  
COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES. 127 
In a recent paper* Mr. Armstrong has reviewed the experience 
‘of the three and a half years under this plan, stating very fully what 
appear to him to be its positive advantages. 
At the outset he disclaims any opposition to coeducation per se, 
with respect to which he says:    
   
        
             
    
              
     
       
      
   I should want to be the last one to suggest a scheme by which our secondary 
schools should be rent in twain and the sexes educated in separate schools. 
In fact, I believe firmly that such a separation would be a distinct loss to both 
sexes in lessening the social and moral influences of each over the other. 
There are, however, certain problems pertaining to the instruction 
of young people at the adolescent period which have been recognized 
by all teachers, and for which, in the opinion of Mr. Armstrong, 
segregation offers the best solution. The first of these problems is 
that of the immaturity of boys as compared with girls at the usual 
age of entrance upon the high school. In respect to this difference 
Mr. Armstrong says: 
When the boy comes to the high school at about 14 he is from one to two 
years less mature than the girls of the same age, and so is unable to approach 
the work with the same degree of seriousness and will power. 
The second problem. to be considered is the difference between the 
two sexes in respect to predominant interests and mental capacity. 
In all the languages [says Mr. Armstrong] the girl excels. The power of 
lverbal memory being stronger and her patience with such a task being greater, 
he is better adapted to learning a language. * * * In ail sciences the boy 
s the advantage in spite of his lack of general maturity. He is a keener 
bserver and a more logical reasoner. The girl needs a more elementary course 
train her powers to see and classify. The boy loves to try experiments and 
is capable of doing much more work in that line. 
From the excess of girls over boys in high-school classes it fol- 
lows, according to Mr. Armstrong, that “the methods of the recita- 
ion have undergone an unconscious evolution to adapt them to the 
irl type.” This explains in part, he thinks, the lack of interest 
shown by boys in high-school studies and their early withdrawal from 
he schools. 
From a careful analysis of the work and the reports of classes in 
he Englewood High School during the experimental period, and 
omparison with corresponding data for previous years, it appears 
hat the ratio of boys “rose from 31 to 84 per hundred pupils in the 
ven years before segregation and from 34 to 38 in the three years 
fter.” According to the report— 
is gain in the ratio of boys was not at the loss of the girls, for the actual 
‘umber of girls also increased rapidly. In other words, while the girls increased 
numbers during the ten years 38 per cent, only 6 per cent of this was gained 
  
* School Review, May 10, 1910, pp. 339-350.  
-P-A-G-E-136
    128 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
before the segregation and 94 per cent of it since. The boys gained 96 per 
cent during the ten years; 21 per cent of this was gained during the seven years 
before and 79 per cent of it during the three years since segregation. 
       
    
        
                
   
    
              
     
      Mr. Armstrong notes the following among other influences— 
that have tended to make the great increase in the ratio of boys since the 
introduction of segregation: (1) The compulsory education law, (2) the open- 
ing of an addition to the school, (3) the introduction of manual training in the 
high schools of Chicago. 
The first of these influences, the compulsory laws, has had little 
effect upon the high schools, as it applies to “first and second year 
pupils only, or to those under 16 years old.” 
Considering the remaining influences named Mr. Armstrong shows 
first that. the opening of the addition to the Englewood School 
“tended to increase the number of girls more than the number of 
boys, and so operated against the increase in the ratio of boys.” 
He continues: 
The introduction of manual training in other Chicago high schools has cer- 
tainly operated strongly against the increase of the ratio of boys. A well- 
equipped manual-training school was opened in a district adjoining in the 
year 1906. Transfers are given freely to all pupils who wish to go to that 
school in order to take a four-year course. Few girls, if any, go there for 
manual training, but a large number of boys do so. Four-year manual-training 
courses in a building with all the appliances necessary attracted boys from all 
over the city; but in spite of all this the ratio steadily rose. I believe that 
there can be no doubt that the special attention given to boys attracted and 
held the boys in the school. 
There is another consideration, namely, that of the adaptations of 
the teachers, which is discussed by Mr. Armstrong, but which seems 
of less consequence as a factor in the segregation policy. It is 
obvious, as he says, that “not all teachers are equally adapted to 
teach both sexes, nor does it follow that men are always the better 
teachers of boys, and women of girls. There are many exceptions 
both ways.” These are distinctions which require adjustments upon 
whatever plan the school is organized. 
Without further attention to the details of this interesting discus- 
sion, it must suffice to present the conclusion with which it closes: 
I fully believe I am justified [says the writer] in the conclusion that the] 
segregation of the sexes during the first and second years of high school hold 
more boys in school, greatly improves their scholarship, and removes from them| 
the feeling of unfair comparisons due to difference in degree of maturity 0: 
children of the same age but opposite sex; and that the possibility of adaptin; 
the work to the needs of each sex will make it easy to train each sex for 
higher degree of efficiency. 
It will be interesting to compare with the report of the Englewoo 
experiment certain facts respecting the Central High School, Cleve: 
land, Ohio. In regard to this school Principal Harris says—   
@ Cited from a letter written by Principal Edwin L. Harris, in response to an inquiry from this office. 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES. 129 
there is segregation in the session or study rooms, which seat 56, and in the 
gymnasium classes and athletic sports. In all academic work the boys and girls 
recite together in class. 
There are enrolled at present in the Central High School, in the different 
classes, the following:

Seniors. 15) 13) Juniors | 146 38 Second year 8 178 | 5 First year. . a1] 85 
Total. | 602} 601 89 
  
This makes about 47 per cent of the school boys—a larger per cent without 
segregation than where segregation has been tried. 
During the last year a good specialized high school of commerce has been 
opened in this city and that course taken out of the senior and junior years of 
the other schools. This will account somewhat for the difference in those two 
classes. ‘They were formerly like the second year, where the number is prac- 
tically equal. In fact, several times there have been a few more boys than 
girls in the senior class. 
There is another local condition. A finely equipped technical high school has 
been established, which did not draw pupils from the advanced grades, but has 
from the first-year pupils, i. e., those who would have entered. 
Before the building of the fine new East High School there were over 2,100 
in attendance at Central High School. The per cent of attendance of the boys : 
has been as high as 49. It will be inferred that the course of study has not 
been planned for girls alone, nor have the methods of recitation “ undergone an 
unconscious evolution to adapt them to the girl type.” 
A suggestion might be made of a kind of segregation that might be helpful, 
and that is a segregation of like abilities. The sentiment that “all men are 
created equal” sounds well, but if it were only true many of our difficulties 
would cease, 
As an illustration of what is meant by segregation of like abilities the plan 
adopted at Central High School with the geometry classes may be interesting. 
First, there are the regular classes for those pupils of average ability. These 
classes take the usual amount of work, besides the demonstrated propositions of 
plane geometry. Secondly, there are other classes for those who will go no 
farther than the high school and who find trouble even with demonstrated prop- 
ositions. These do no original work, but “confine themselves to the book.” 
‘Thirdly, there is a class, or classes, for those who are really stars in mathe- 
matics and who are eager for all the original investigation and demonstrative 
work that may be given to them. These classes are open to girls as well as to 
boys, and there are as many of the former as of the latter. 
This plan is possible in a large school for all subjects, but is especially helpful 
in mathematics and natural sciences. 
Principal Harris states that he has been following with deep inter- 
est the experiment at Englewood on account of its bearing upon 
problems which have impressed him also. He expresses the opinion, 
however, that they can all be met by adjustments that are possible

under the coeducation plan, a conclusion which seems to him borne 
out by the record of his own school. 
In connection with this subject it may be noted that the widespread 
movement for vocational training is introducing new determining 
factors into the conduct of public education. So far as can be 
judged at this incipient stage of the movement, it is likely to lead 
to the provision of separate schools or departments for boys and 
girls at the moment when vocational specialization begins. The con- 
siderations bearing particularly upon vocational training for girls 
were discussed by Doctor Snedden, state commissioner of education 
for Massachusetts, in a recent address, in the course of which he said: 
Vocational education for girls is no less necessary in modern society than voca- 
tional education for boys. All women in civilized society should be workers 
and producers, and in order that they may work and produce well they should 
have training along the special lines of their aptitudes and probable fields of 
vocational effort. When it is said that all women should be workers and pro- 
ducers it is, of course, understood that the largest single vocation for women 
is that of home making, with all that that implies. Consequently vocations for 
women may be divided into two classes—the home making and the wage- 
earning. 
The peculiarly difficult problem in the vocational education of girls arises 
from the fact that almost all women will and, in the nature of the case, must 
prepare for each of the above classes of vocations. The average American girl 
under present social conditions must serve a part of her life as wage-earner 
and the major portion of her life as home maker. The larger majority of Ameri- 
* can girls to-day are wage-earners from 15 and 16 to perhaps 20 or 21 years of 
age, after which they undertake home making as a career. If they enter upon 
the wage-earning occupations with no preparation they are destined to have low 
wages and incur the dangers of being exploited as many are at the present. If 
they enter upon the subsequent vocation of home making without preparation 
the conditions are disastrous to health and to the home. 
A few conclusions then with reference to the vocational education of girls are 
manifest. As far as practicable the period up to 16 should be reserved for 
school life, and along with the necessary liberal education the latter years of 
this period should be made fairly rich in the vocational education which will 
contribute to health and mastery of the home arts and the social knowledge 
which may later function in home making. At the same time it must be realized 
that the girl must become a wage-earner in some calling which will claim her 
attention for anywhere from five to eight or ten years. As far as practicable 
those vocations should be sought for girls, preparation for which is not too far 
removed from ultimate efficiency in the home, but it must be frankly recognized 
that the vast majority of wage-earning callings to-day opening to young women 
have very little bearing on home efficiency. 
* * * * * * * 
In Massachusetts we have made only a beginning of the vocational education 
of girls. It remains to be seen whether it will prove desirable to open special 
vocational schools to take in from the ages of 14 to 16 the vast number of girls 
who are destined to work in factory processes at a comparatively moderate 
wage. My personal opinion is that it will prove highly desirable to have such 
schools, even if their courses are comparatively short.¢

                               If these ideas are carried out, specialization for vocational training 
would begin at 14 years of age, which is about the average age for 
admission to high schools. 
COEDUCATION IN HIGHER INSTITUTIONS. 
RECENT ACTION OF TUFTS COLLEGE. 
In the field of higher education, the most important event of the 
year, as regards coeducation, is the action of the trustees of Tufts 
College, Massachusetts, abandoning the coeducation plan. The action 
was taken in accordance with the recommendations of a committee 
which had been appointed for a complete investigation of the problem 
as related to this institution. In pursuance of their purpose, the 
committee freely consulted the members of the faculty of liberal arts, 
and also representatives of the associations of graduates of both sexes. 
The report submitted comprised a full statement of the reasons for 
the change recommended, many of which were peculiar to the in- 
stitution immediately concerned. The conviction was expressed by 
the committee that there is a fundamental difficulty “in the way of 
success of coeducation in Tufts College, and that this difficulty lies 
in and pervades the whole student body, growing stronger rather 
than diminishing.” It appeared from the investigation that the 
sentiment against coeducation prevented many staunch supporters of 
the college from sending their own daughters to Tufts, and in many 
cases, their sons also. Naturally, such persons would not recommend 
Tufts to others. 
With respect to the new policy recommended, the committee say: 
It is our conviction that if and when any move for the segregation of the 
women in Tufts College is undertaken it must be full and complete. It being 
determined that the thing itself is desirable—no halfway steps are wise. 
What is done must certainly be so done that the women shall be able to say 
that they have equal opportunity with the men. It does not seem to us that 
this would be accomplished by opening a department for women, as we now 
have a department of engineering, but that to secure success a separate in- 
stitution exclusively for women with a suitable and appropriate name and the 
right and power to grant its separate degrees, should be established. This 
institution should have its own officers and faculty. With this object in mind 
we have prepared a rough draft of certain amendments to the charter of this 
corporation which seem to secure the ends sought and still keep the government 
land control within the hands of this corporation and to permit the making of 
ithe two faculties in harmony and to a large extent composed of the same men. 
This last, of course, is highly desirable and in fact necessary in our present 
financial condition. 
Your committee, after carefully weighing and considering all the phases of 
ithe matter as herein set forth, respectfully present: 
That in their opinion the best interests of this institution require a separation 
f the sexes. 
That the best way of accomplishing this is by the establishment of an in- 
lependent college for women.
-P-A-G-E-140
  132 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
That the importance of the matter is so great that even though the financial 
resources are not at this moment in hand to meet the extra cost, the action 
should be taken at the earliest possible moment, and efforts be made at once 
to secure the necessary funds therefor. 
We recommend securing an amendment to the charter of Tufts College 
authorizing the establishment of a separate college for women to be known 
as Jackson College for Women, and that, with the opening of the next college 
year, a woman’s department be established which shall be merged into the 
Jackson College for Women as soon as the legislation therefor shall be secured. 
The resolution giving effect to these recommendations was 
adopted by vote of the trustees, April 12 of the current year, and in 
accordance therewith a bill was introduced into the legislature, 
passed, and approved June 15, authorizing “the corporation known 
as the ‘ Trustees of Tufts College’ to establish and maintain for the 
education of women exclusively a college to be known as the Jack- 
son College for Women.” 
The act declares that— 
all the provisions contained in the act establishing the “Trustees of Tufts 
College,” and in the acts in amendment thereof, shall relate to the Jackson 
College for Women, so far as they are applicable, except as provided in this 
act. 
* * * * * * * 
The corporation may, in the name of Jackson College for Women, confer any 
of the degrees which it is by law authorized to confer: Provided, however, 
That degrees so conferred in course shall be conferred exclusively upon 
women. It may also adopt and use upon diplomas, and other written instru- 
ments issued in the Jackson College for Women, a seal of a design differing 
from the common seal of the corporation. 
In response to inquiries from many alumne of the institution as 
to the reasons for the new departure, the statement was made that 
a will had been written leaving to a college for women, to be 
separately chartered but to be operated by the trustees of Tufts 
College, a sum probably not less than $500,000. This money would 
not be available for a department of Tufts College. It is under- 
stood that this is the only definite promise of endowment for the 
college which has yet been made. 
Pending the establishment of Jackson College, arrangements will 
be made within the existing college for a separate department for 
young women which will be conducted in the coming fall session 
upon the segregation plan. 
The action of the trustees in this matter solves a problem which has 
troubled the administration of Tufts College for several years. Co- 
education has been the subject of several presidential reports, and of 
repeated discussions in alumni meetings. Soon after his inaugura- 
tion, President Hamilton pronounced himself in favor of separating 
the sexes, and the measure now adopted is largely the result of his 
personal efforts; at the same time, it appears to meet the approval
-P-A-G-E-141
COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES. 133 
of nearly all persons directly responsible for the welfare of the insti- 
tution. 
Vigorous protests against this departure from the course that was 
adopted at Tufts eighteen years ago were made at a meeting of the 
“Women’s Ministerial Conference,” held in Boston in May. The 
‘sentiment of the meeting was voiced by Julia Ward Howe, who ex- 
pressed deep regret that Tufts College should take such a backward 
step as that represented by the separation of the women students, 
and urged her listeners to bring this question before the public in 
every possible way. It was voted that each member use her influence 
to have a discussion of this matter introduced at the approaching 
Biennial of the Federation of Women’s Clubs, to be opened in Cin- 
cinnati on May 10. 
     
          
                               
       
    
   
        OPPOSITE TENDENCIES IN EASTERN AND WESTERN INSTITUTIONS. 
The action of the trustees of Tufts College, following so soon after 
the similar action by the trustees of Wesleyan University, Middle- 
town, Conn., which was reported in 1909, emphasizes the distinction 
between the Eastern States and the Western in respect to coeduca- 
tion as a feature of their higher institutions of learning. Undoubt- 
edly custom and sentiment in the East favor the idea of separate 
colleges for men and for women. This is clearly indicated by official 
statistics. Thus it appears that the ten colleges and universities in 
the New England States which are coeducational in their under- 
graduate departments (Tufts and Wesleyan not included) had in 
1909 a total of 1,186 women undergraduate students, as against 4,877 
in the corresponding departments of separate colleges for women. 
The provision of these separate colleges for women in the older States 
came about naturally from the fact that the colleges for men in that 
section antedate, as a rule, the demand for such provision for women; 
consequently when this demand arose it was met by the foundation 
of distinct institutions. It should be considered also that the higher 
institutions of the East are largely of private origin and endowment, 
nd therefore are limited in various ways by special charter provisions 
lor conditions of endowment, and do not so fully embody the demo- 
ratic ideas of the people as institutions founded and maintained by 
ublic appropriations. The distinction in this respect is illustrated 
y the history of coeducation in the University of Wisconsin, which 
is reviewed by Mrs. Olin in her book entitled “ The Women of a State 
niversity.”* The work was called forth by events that were inter- 
reted by some persons as adverse to the continuance of coeducation 
n that institution; these fears have been allayed, however, by the

resolution of the regents, adopted in 1908, reiterating the rules pub- 
lished twenty years before. The resolution declares “ There shall be 
no discrimination on account of sex in granting scholarships or fel- 
lowships in any of the colleges or departments of the university.” 
   
                                                                    
   GENERAL BEARING OF THE QUESTION. 
On the whole, the question of coeducation appears more and more 
as one of adjustment to prevailing conditions, hence experiments 
at temporary segregation, or complete separation of students on the 
basis of sex, are not likely to effect any radical change in the prevail- 
ing policy of the different sections of the country in this respect. The 
reorganization of industry and the vast increase of municipal public 
services and of collective social activities are giving new measures 
of efficiency for both men and women, and will doubtless in time be- 
come the determining factor in regard to the methods and conditions 
of higher education of women. This bearing of the subject is com- 
prehensively set forth by Prof. Marion Talbot in her recent work 
on “The Education of Women.”* In the course of an analysis of 
college curricula with the purpose of illustrating their relation to 
public demands Mrs. Talbot incidentally shows that separate colleges 
for women have not adjusted themselves to modern conditions as 
fully as have state universities open to both sexes. The experiment 
of limited segregation at the University of Chicago is not referred to 
in this work, but in her recent report as dean of women in that uni- 
versity Professor Talbot presents interesting facts bearing upon the 
subject. In this report she says: 
Frequent inquiries are made of the dean of women as to the effect of separate 
instruction for men and women on the relative attendance of men and women. 
It seems timely to present some facts bearing on the subject. The impression 
is widespread that the sexes are entirely separated in instruction in the junior 
colleges, whereas recent reports from the dean of the junior colleges have 
shown that only about one-half of the first-year students and a very much 
smaller proportion of second-year students are affected by the system. These 
take from one-third to all of their work in classes divided on sex lines. 
The report comprises two tables, giving the number of students in 
the junior and senior colleges and their distribution by courses of study 
since the opening of the university. So many circumstances, however, 
affected the attendance and choice of studies, both before and after 
the segregation plan was adopted, that the statistics are of little valu 
for any light they throw upon the results of the policy. Among th 
circumstances that have affected the attendance of men the followin, 
are particularly noted in the report: 
Separate instruction for men and women was introduced in 19034. In th 
same year Hutchison Commons, Hitchcock Hall, and the Reynolds Club, and i

the following year the Bartlett gymnasium, were opened for men; and there has 
been no increase in the accommodations or equipment for women. Moreover, in 
1901 the university introduced a two-year medical course which might be 
counted as credit toward the bachelor’s degree, and in 1902 the law school was 
opened, offering one year of law, which might be credited as the fourth year of 
college work. In 1906 Latin was made an elective entrance subject, except for 
the degree in arts, and elementary courses in engineering were offered. In 
view of all these facts, it is evidently impossible [continues Miss Talbot] to 
determine the extent to which the increase in the attendance of men is due 
to separate instruction, an increase from 1902 to 1906 greater than at any of 
the men’s colleges of the East, or even of several! of them combined. ‘The fig- 
ures show that fewer men, actually and proportionately, are taking a classical 
or literary course at the University of Chicago and more are taking a scientific 
or a commercial course, even though more of the instruction for the former is 
given in separate sections than for the latter courses. Apparently in general 
the men students are choosing their work irrespective of the presence of women 
in their classes. There are probably a few cases of men who are deterred from 
entering a class in French or in art because of the preponderance of women, 
and, on the other hand, there may be a few women who may not go into a class 
in municipal government or commercial geography because of large numbers of 
men. But, on the whole, it is evident that the Chicago student is going to study 
what he wants as he can get it.    
   
                            
   
   
                  
      
    
   UNIVERSITY DISTINCTIONS FOR WOMEN. 
In the larger outlook of higher education for women the most 
important recent events relate to their admission to the graduate and 
professional departments of universities and the recognition of their 
public services by the award of scholastic degrees. A recent illus- 
tration of the former tendency is the admission of women to the 
courses of law and medicine offered by Columbia University for the 
summer session of the current year; notable instances of the univer- 
sity recognition of women honoris causa are the honorary degree of 
doctor of letters conferred upon Mrs. Schuyler Van Rensselaer, the 
author of “The History of the City of New York,” by Columbia 
University at the commencement exercises of the year, and the hon- 
orary degree of master of arts conferred upon Miss Jane Addams by 
Yale University. 
Professor Perrin, who presented the candidates at the Yale com- 
mencement, gave happy expression to the work which marks Miss 
Addams as the highest exponent of the newly forming social ideals. 
He said: 
Hull House is the most extensive and important social settlement in the 
United States. No other one institution perhaps has had more influence in 
shaping and inspiring the present movement toward social reconstruction in 
his country. 
Behind this vital institution stands the vital personality of Miss Addams. 
he has had a prophetic vision of what might be done, and militant courage, 
mited with a high order of administrative, social, and political capacity, in 
oing and getting it done.

University recognition of public service rendered by women 
through the exercise of high esthetic talent or administrative ability 
will inevitably react upon the institutions themselves to break down 
barriers against women students, whether of closed doors or limited 
provision. 
    
    
                  
      
    
      
    
       
   IX. SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES. 
RIFLE PRACTICE IN SCHOOLS. 
The annual meeting of the National Board for the Promotion of 
Rifle Practice was held in Washington, D. C., January 24, 1906. The 
question of building up an interest in target practice throughout the 
schools of the country was discussed, and a special committee was ap- 
pointed to inquire into and report at the next annual meeting of the 
board upon the feasibility and advisability of some policy to in- 
augurate a system of rifle practice throughout the schools of the 
country. The committee visited New York City, where rifle practice 
had already been introduced into the schools, and, after inspecting the 
organization and methods, offered the following recommendations in 
their report to the board at the 1907 meeting: 
1. That the largest possible publicity should be given to the methods that 
have been found to be so successful in the New York high schools. 
2. That the educational officials of the different States should be urged to 
introduce instruction in rifle shooting in their schools among the boys of 13 
years of age and upward, conforming to the New York methods as far as their 
situation will permit. 
3. That this would be helped by the Oren nea OL of a public schools athletic 
league in each educational center. 
At the 1907 meeting of the board the by-laws of the National Rifle 
Association of America were amended as follows to provide for 
affiliated clubs from institutions of learning: 
Fourth class, college rifle clubs.—To consist of rifle clubs, as far as shooting 
members are concerned, of students in colleges, universities, and institutions of 
learning conferring degrees. Five dollars membership fee and $5 annual dues, 
membership fee to cover first year’s dues. 
Fifth class, schoolboy clubs.—To consist of rifle clubs composed, as far as} 
shooting members are concerned, of students in public schools, academies, pre- 
paratory and high schools, and private schools, being all schools which do no: 
confer a degree. Two dollars membership fee and $2 annual dues, membershi) 
fee to cover first year’s dues. 
According to the report of the board for 1909, rifle clubs have bee: 
formed in 26 colleges and universities, and 60 clubs in high schools 
and academies. The latter class were in 47 different cities and town: 
in 23 States.

SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES. 1387 
The course of rifle firing for outdoor and indoor qualifications, 
prescribed to the board for schoolboy clubs, is as follows: 
Junior marksman, outdoor qualification—Each member, not over 18 years of 
age, will fire 10 shots standing and 10 shots prone at 200 yards, 2 sighting 
shots allowed at the beginning of the firing. Those members making a score of 
not less than 35 points standing and 40 points prone, or a total of 75 points of a 
possible 100, will be designated as “junior marksman,” and will receive a 
suitable decoration. 
Junior marksman, indoor qualification—Each member, not over 18 years of 
age, will fire 10 shots standing and 10 shots prone at 50 feet on the National 
Rifle Association 50-foot target. No sighting shots. Rifle, .22 caliber. Those 
members making a score of 38 points standing and 42 points prone, or a total of 
80 of a possible 100, will receive a lapel button. 
Qualification may also be made on the subtarget gun machine, a score of 45 
standing being required. 
Lieut. Albert S. Jones, Hibbs Building, Washington, D. C., is 
secretary of the National Rifle Association of America. 
THE BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA. 
The boy-scout idea in America began some ten years ago as the 
result of papers on woodcraft and scouting written by Ernest 
Thompson Seton and published in various periodicals. The name 
of this brotherhood was “ The Woodcraft Indians.” 
In 1908 Gen. Sir Robert Baden-Powell organized The Boy Scouts 
in England. With the modifications necessary to suit our condi- 
tions, this organization has been adopted here under the name 
The Boy Scouts of America. The object of the association is to 
direct the boys’ enthusiasm into proper channels. The boys are 
taught to appreciate the things about them, and receive training 
in endurance, self-reliance, self-control, and helpfulness. A manual 
for The Boy Scouts of America has been prepared by Ernest Thomp- 
son Seton. 
The officers of the committee on organization are: Chairman, 
Ernest Thompson Seton, New York City; secretary, Lee F. Hanmer, 
Russell Sage Foundation, New York City; treasurer, George D. 
Pratt, Pratt Institute, New York City. The office of the organiza- 
tion is at 124 East Twenty-eighth street, New York City. 
SCHOOL SAVINGS BANKS. 
School savings banks have been in existence in the United States 
since 1885, in which year the first bank was opened in a public school 
of Long Island City, N. Y., through the efforts of Mr. J. H. Thiry, 
the great promoter of the system in this country. From a recent 
report prepared by him on the subject it appears that there were on 
January 1, 1910, school savings banks in 108 cities:in the United 
States. Deposits were collected at 7,330 schoolrooms or stations,  
-P-A-G-E-146
    138 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
and the depositors numbered 166,525. In the twenty-five years since 
the first bank was established the total deposits have amounted to 
$4,618,734.96, the withdrawals to $3,893,637.47, leaving $725,097.49 
in the banks January 1, 1910. 
X. HEALTH AND HYGIENE, 
AMERICAN SCHOOL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION. 
The American School Hygiene Association held its fourth congress 
at Indianapolis, Ind., March 2-4, 1910, in joint session with the fol- 
lowing societies: Department of Superintendence, National Educa- 
tion Association; and American Physical Education Association, with 
its allied society, the Public School Physical Training Society. 
An important feature of the proceedings was the report of the 
committee on status of instruction in hygiene in American educational 
institutions.* 
On account of the great seope of the investigation it was divided 
into two parts, the first comprising the subject as related to colleges 
and universities; and the second, as related to the public secondary 
schools. From the report of Dr. George L. Meylan, of Columbia 
University, who had charge of the first division, the following par- 
ticulars are summarized: The analysis of replies to an elaborate ques- 
tionnaire sent to 138 colleges and universities shows that in 1909 
hygiene was taught in 97 leading colleges, and in 1910 was a 
prescribed course in 47 leading colleges. 
An interesting fact brought out in the report is that of— 
the tendency to correlate all the interests related to the physical welfare of the 
students in the department of physical education or hygiene and physical edu- 
cation. The activities usually grouped in that department include the teaching 
of hygiene, gymnastics, and athletics, the care of the students’ health and, in 
some cases, the supervision of sanitary condition of school buildings, dormitories, 
kitchen, water supply, and grounds. The further development of this growing 
tendency is limited only by the supply of men possessing the necessary character, 
general education, professional training, administrative ability, and sympathetic 
personality to properly direct a department of so broad and diversified interests. 
Dr. Luther H. Gulick, who had charge of the investigation as 
related to the public secondary schools, submitted tables showing the 
status of physical education in-90 public normal schools and 2,392 
public high schools in the United States, prepared by him from infor- 
mation collected by the United States Bureau of Education. A table 
comprised in his report, which follows, gives the average number of

COMMITTEE ON THE PHYSICAL WELFARE OF SCHOOL CHILDREN, 
CALIFORNIA. 
At the second annual meeting of the California Superintendents’ 
Convention, held at Riverside, Cal., April 25-29, 1910, the report of 
a special committee appointed at the previous meeting on the physical 
welfare of school children was presented by Supt. Frank F. Bunker. 
The report comprised the following recommendations: 
1. That vigorous measures be taken to prevent, so far as possible, disease 
among the school children, and we particularly urge that the state board of 
health prescribe the time during which children should be excluded from school 
on account of contagious diseases.  
-P-A-G-E-148
140 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
2. (a) That all school health officers shall be employed by and under the 
authority of school boards; and 
(b) That school health officers be certificated and chosen because of their effi- 
ciency in health work rather than as practitioners. 
38. That outside of cities the school authorities shall be given the authority 
by law to call upon county health officers for advice in health matters, and that 
within cities having no school health officers these duties shall devolve upon 
the city health officers. 
4. That the vaccination law should apply to all schools alike, and that the 
burden of enforcement shall be placed upon the health officers, the schools 
furnishing such reports as may be required by law. 
5. That a physical examination of teachers be required by law, such examina- 
tions to be ‘approved by the health officers in such schools as have them and 
elsewhere by an examining board in each county, and that the form of certifi- 
cate be prescribed jointly by the state board of education and state board of 
health. 
6. That attention be given to the size of school grounds. No school building 
should be located on less than one-half acre with an additional one-fourth acre 
for each classroom, and we favor such a requirement by law. 
7. That the state board of health and state board of education jointly be 
authorized to. prescribe the minimum requirements in reference to the location, 
lighting, and sanitation of school buildings, to which all plans must conform 
before the same shall be approved by superintendents. 
8. That steps be taken to bring about the physical examination of all children 
in our schools. Where this can not be done by health officials it should be done 
by teachers and principals. 
9. That this convention appoint a committee to cooperate with the state 
board of health in reference to the matters recommended in this report and 
other health legislation relative to schools that may be proposed. 
10. That hereafter such portions of the general health laws as relate to the 
schools shall be printed in the editions of the school laws. 
11. That at the earliest opportunity the state board of education shall adopt 
a text-book in physiology, giving due attention to hygiene and sanitation. 
12. That we urge all school authorities to devote themselves to the teaching 
of the evil effects of the use of tobacco and particularly to the great danger to 
youth in the use of cigarettes. 
DENTAL INSPECTION IN THE CLEVELAND PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
The report of the Cleveland Dental Society on the proposed 
dental and hygienic work in the Cleveland public schools contains 
_a summary statement of the campaign conducted by the association 
to introduce dental inspection and oral hygiene into the Cleveland 
public schools and the results thus far obtained. In 1898 the associ-. 
ation first requested that dental inspection be introduced into the 
schools. The board of education did not grant the request, but con- 
sented to accept for use in the public schools a series of rules and 
instructions on the care of the teeth drafted by the association. These 
are still used as a basis for instruction in the schools. Other 
efforts have been made to introduce dental inspection since that date, 
and in order to show the need for such work the dental society ob- 
tained permission from the board (1908-9) to examine the mouths
-P-A-G-E-149
HEALTH AND HYGIENE. 141 
and teeth of the children in four public schools, and noted the follow- 
ing defects: Murray Hill School, 864 pupils examined, 802 defective 
mouths with 3,920 dental cavities; Waterson School, 289 pupils ex- 
amined, 284 defective mouths with 1,342 dental cavities; Doan School, 
691 pupils examined, 671 defective mouths with 4,294 dental cavities; 
Marvin School, 824 pupils examined, 811 defective mouths with 
5,505 dental cavities. Many of the children attending these schools 
are from the homes of the foreign-born population of the city. : 
As a result of the investigation the board of education accepted 
a proposition of the Cleveland Dental Society to conduct gratis for 
the year 1910 the following work: To make one dental examination 
of all pupils in the public schools within the year; to establish for the 
year four centrally located clinics for the treatment of the indigent 
poor; and to conduct a series of practical and illustrated talks on ve 
hygiene.       
    
                 
    
   
     
        
   MEDICAL INSPECTION IN NEW JERSEY. 
General rules relating to the medical inspection of schools were 
adopted by the New Jersey state board of education at a meeting 
held October 5, 1909. They specify that every local board of educa- 
tion shall appoint as medical inspector of schools in its district a 
egular practitioner for a period of one year and shall regulate his 
alary. Two or more adjoining school districts may unite, however, 
or the sake of economy, in the employment of an inspector. 
The regulations require that rural schools shall be visited by the 
nspector at least twice each month, village schools and those of 
mall towns at least once a week, those of towns and cities at least 
hree times a week, and schools located in the crowded districts of 
arge cities shall be visited daily. At the commencement of each 
chool year the medical inspector shall make a systematic examina- 
jon of each child in his district. 
MILK CONTRACT FOR ST. LOUIS SCHOOL CHILDREN. 
In order to provide a supply of pure milk, cream, and butter for 
upils who procure luncheons at the schools, the St. Louis school 
oard prepared for the year 1909-10 a special contract embodying 
ch sanitary precautions as they thought necessary to insure purity 
the dairy products supplied. 
Sealed proposals from the dairymen desirous of contracting with 
e schools are received at the office of the supply commissioner. 
PHYSICAL WELFARE OF SCHOOL CHILDREN. 
The information in the following table was collected by the bureau 
municipal research of New York City, April 1, 1910, and is 
tended to show what school authorities are doing to promote the
-P-A-G-E-150
  142 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
physical welfare of school children in cities having a population of 
8,000 or more. 
Particulars to which the inquiry was directed are sufficiently indi- 
cated by the table headings. The crosses in the table represent 
affirmative replies. The reference letters show, (a) the States in 
which no laws have been enacted requiring or authorizing the phys- 
ical examination of school children; (6) States in which such 
examinations are authorized but not required; (¢) States in which 
they are compulsory; (d) States in which they apply to certain 
cities; (e) compulsory for cities, permissible for rural districts; (f) 
law applies to examination for defects of sight and hearing only; 
(g) special schools.

   EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
XII. EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 
HAMPTON INSTITUTE NEGRO CONFERENCE. 
The fourteenth annual conference for negroes at Hampton Norma. 
‘and Agricultural Institute was held July 13-14, 1910. The confer: 
ence brought together several hundred negro teachers, lawyers, edi 
tors, insurance and business men, ministers, physicians, and farm 
ers. Cooperation for right living was the central theme of th 
papers and discussions. Addresses were delivered on industrial edu 
cation in Virginia schools, improvement of public welfare, negr« 
press, antituberculosis movement, agricultural education and rura 
life, and other subjects. The resolutions adopted included recom 
mendations for the organization of negro teachers for mutual im 
provement; the dissemination of agricultural information among th 
country people; and cooperation on the part of churches in th 
improvement of schools and providing wholesome and uplifting 
amusements for their respective communities.— (The Southern Work 
man, August, 1910.) 
HAMPTON INSTITUTE SUMMER SESSION FOR TEACHERS AND BUSINES! 
MEN. 
The summer session at Hampton Normal and Agricultural Insti 
tute for teachers was held under the joint auspices of the school anc 
the Virginia board of education June 14 to July 12, 1910. 
Two groups of courses of studies were offered, Group A comprising 
those studies required by the state board of education for a first 
grade certificate, and Group B including the following industria 
subjects: Cooking, dressmaking, manual training, poultry keepin; 
elementary sewing, and upholstery. 
In addition to the session for teachers, a session for business me. 
was also held, the announcement of which outlined the followin 
course : 
      
    
   
    
      
    A consideration of the practical matters involved in the purchase, sale, ai 
ownership of property, including a study of titles, bills of sale, deeds, will} 
real-estate mortgages, chattel mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments, asses 
ments, taxes, and mechanic’s liens, 
The different forms of investments, such as stocks, bonds, mortgages, et 
and the nature and advantages of each form for investment purposes will 
studied. 
The following subjects will be considered: Contracts, checks, notes, draft 
bills of exchange, interest, usury, bank, cash, and trade discounts, busine 
letters, methods of advertising and accounting, and the factors of cost whi 
enter into business transactions. The formation, incorporation, and mana; 
ment of banks, trust companies, building and loan associations, insurance, a 
cooperative organizations will be discussed.

EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 155 
The business course is intended for those who desire to enlarge 
their knowledge of the laws and operations of business. 
The total registration for both courses numbered 191. 
NEGRO RURAL SCHOOL FUND—ANNA T. JEANES FOUNDATION. 
At the beginning of the school year 1909-10, $46,078 of the income 
of the Anna.T. Jeanes Foundation was set aside for the salaries of 
teachers, supervisors, and organizers. The total number in employ- 
ment April 1, 1910, was 149, distributed as follows:

The work is confined to 125 different counties, and in all 1,656 
schools are under the direction of the foundation. 
The following information regarding the work during the year has 
been compiled from statements made to the board by James H. Dil- 
lard, president and general agent. 
From Statement VII, September 20, 190% 
After emphasizing the unique work which the board has undertaken, 
President Dillard continues: 
Our purpose is to work for these isolated rural schools by trying to get more 
money for them from the public-school authorities, by trying to organize the 
people themselves for self-help, especially in the direction of extending the school 
term and having better schoolhouses, and by illustrating how the introduction 
of simple forms of manual training into even the smallest schools will improve 
their efficiency. Three plans are proposed for the improvement of the schools: 
1. The plan which was followed last year in Henrico County, Va. This plan 
is, in brief, that a teacher give her time to visiting the schools of a county. She 
is, in fact, a constant supervisor, in addition to her work of introducing simple 
kinds of manual training, and is able to improve the schools in many ways. 
2. The plan of locating a teacher at some central school as headquarters and 
having this teacher do extension work among a number of schools that may be 
within reach, again acting as supervisor. 
3. The plan for putting a man into a county whose duty it is to go into each 
school district, organize the people for home and school improvement, and do 
whatever may seem possible for improving public sentiment for better schools. 
Such a worker would also be a supervisor of the schools. 
In earrying out these plans next session I can say that our work is limited 
only by our means. The demand in each of the three methods far exceeds our 
funds. From all the teachers whom we pay next session I shall demand definite 
statistics for the counties in which they are working. I hope that in this way 
we shall be able to secure a body of reliable facts covering at least a hundred 
counties,

From Statement VIII, March 9, 1910, 
    
                                        
         
   
        
   We have 148 extension and supervising teachers and organizers now at work. 
At the end of each month I receive a report from all the teachers and organizers, 
giving the schools and communities visited, the number of visits made at each 
place, and a brief statement of the work attempted. * * * I am more and 
more convinced of the good influence of our plan of work, and very much hope 
that we may be able to extend it. Our teachers’ salaries for February amounted 
to $6,652.50. We have spent so far this session for teachers’ salaries a total of 
$25,933.50; for building and equipment, $2,485; and for extension of term, $275. 
TUSKEGEE INSTITUTE DEPARTMENT OF SCHOOL EXTENSION. 
An extension department was organized at Tuskegee Institute, 
Alabama, in 1910 for the purpose of systematizing the various activi- 
ties of the school in this connection. The first division, under the 
head of school extension proper, comprises the following agencies of 
instruction: The annual Tuskegee negro conference, which is held two 
days in every year, in the month of January; local conferences, an 
agent is employed by the school, whose duty it is to organize local con- 
ferences in different communities in the State and visit those confer- 
ences already established in order to encourage and direct them in 
their effort to build up the local schools and improve family and com- 
munity life generally; farmers’ institute, monthly meetings are held 
in the school’s agricultural building; short course in agriculture, 
which gives the farmers of the counties surrounding the school an 
opportunity to spend two weeks at the school in study and observa- 
tion; the Jesup agricultural wagon; mothers’ meetings, ete. 
Under the second division is the continuation school, which offers| 
to persons who have gone out from the institute and are engaged in 
teaching opportunities to continue their studies under the super- 
vision of the institute. 
XII. INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION RELATIONS. 
During his stay in Europe, ex-President Theodore Roosevelt visite: 
several important universities and delivered addresses on the follow: 
ing subjects: “ Citizenship in the republic,” at the Sorbonne, Paris 
April 23, 1910; “The world movement,” University of Berlin, Ma: 
12, 1910; and “ Biological analogies in history,” University of Oxford. 
June 7, 1910. 
At the conclusion of his lecture at the University of Berlin th 
honorary degree of doctor of philosophy was conferred upon him 
The presence of Emperor William was a special mark of courtesy 
for it was the first time the Emperor had attended « conferment.
-P-A-G-E-165
  
INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION RELATIONS. 157 
On May 26, 1910, Cambridge University conferred upon ex-Presi- 
dent Roosevelt the honorary degree of doctor of laws. 
The British ambassador, Hon. James Bryce, during the year 
addressed several important college and university gatherings. At 
the inauguration of Dr. Ernest Fox Nichols as president of Dart- 
mouth. College, Ambassador Bryce spoke in behalf of the English 
founders and benefactors. During the year he delivered two series 
of lectures, one in the Henry Ward Beecher course at Amherst Col- 
lege on the subject of “ The rise of political liberty ;” the other series 
was delivered at Yale University on the subject, “ The hindrances to 
good citizenship.” 
He was a delegate from the University of Oxford at the inaugura- 
tion of President Abbott Lawrence Lowell. On this occasion Harvard 
University conferred upon him the honorary degree of doctor of 
letters. In conferring the degree President Lowell characterized the 
recipient as follows: 
       
             
   
            
   
   
    
    
    
    
   
        
    
   
    James Bryce, delegate from the University of Oxford, guide, honored and 
beloved by all students of political science, whose portrayal of our Government 
will last as long as books are read; an envoy who has earned the gratitude of 
two nations by drawing closer the ties that bind the children to a common stock.

uring the academic year 1908-9 was 179. Of these, 78 were from the colonies 
f the Empire, 90 were from the United States, and 11 from Germany. At the 
nd of the summer term 33 scholars completed the period of their scholarships, 
hile 31 new scholars came into residence in the October term. Five scholars 
ave been given permission to suspend their scholarships temporarily, while 
ex-scholars remain in residence engaged in teaching, research, or special 
tudy for examination. The total number of scholars and ex-scholars at the 
ginning of the new academic year 1909-10 was 178. %

INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE TEACHING OF MATHEMATICS. 
The international commission on the teaching of mathematics was 
inaugurated by the Fourth International Congress of Mathematics, 
held at Rome, April 6-11, 1908, in accordance with the following 
resolution : 
The congress, recognizing the importance of a comparative examination of the 
ethods and plans of study of the instruction in mathematics in the secondary 
hools of the different nations, empowers Messrs. Klein, Greenhill, and Fehr 
o form an international commission to study this question and present a 
eneral report to the next congress. 
ORGANIZATION OF THE COMMISSION. 
The commission was organized with Prof. F, Klein, of Gottingen, 
s president; Sir George Greenhill, of London, vice-president; and 
rof. H. Fehr, of Geneva, secretary ; these officers forming the central 
ommittee, which has the fullest powers. The remaining members 
onsist of— - 
lelegates representing the countries which have taken part in at least two of 
the international congresses of mathematicians with an average of at least two 
embers. Each of these countries is entitled to 1 delegate. Those countries 
hich have had an average of at least 10 members may have 2 or 8 delegates. 
In voting and in discussions of the commission each country will have, however, 
ut one vote. 
These countries, called “ participating countries,’ which are invited to take 
art in the work of the commission, are the following: 
Germany (2 or 38 delegates) ; Austria (2 or 3 delegates); Belgium (1 dele- 
late) ; Denmark (1 delegate) ; Spain (1 delegate) ; Hungary (2 or 3 delegates) ; 
reat Britain (2 or 3 delegates); Italy (2 or 8 delegates); Norway (1 dele- 
te) ; Portugal (1 delegate) ; United States (2 or 3 delegates) ; France (2 or 
delegates) ; Greece (1 delegate); Holland (1 delegate) ; Roumania (1 dele-

       gate); Russia (2 or 8 delegates) ; Sweden (1 delegate) ; Switzerland (2 or 3 
delegates). 
The countries which do not fulfill above conditions, but which by their institu- 
tions are able to contribute to the progress of the science, are invited to be 
represented by a delegate who will participate in the work of the commission, 
without, however, taking part in voting. 
These countries will be called “associated countries.” The following is a 
preliminary list, and is subject to enlargement: 
Argentine Republic, Australia, Brazil, China, Cape Colonies, Egypt, India, 
Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Mexico, Peru, Servia, Turkey, Japan. 
The different delegations are invited to affiliate with themselves national sub- 
commissions, comprising representatives of the various stages of the teaching} 
of mathematics in the general schools and in the technical and professional] 
schools. These subcommissions are designed to aid the delegates in the elabora- 
tion of the reports. 
SCOPE OF THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION. 
The text of the resolution of the congress at Rome mentioned onl. 
the teaching of mathematics in secondary schools. But, as the ai 
of these schools and the length of their courses vary in differen 
countries, the commission extended its work “to include the whol 
field of mathematical instruction, from the earliest work to the highe 
instruction.” Instead of confining its inquiry to institutions leadin, 
to the university, “it will study also the teaching of mathematics i 
technical and professional schools.” Indeed, the commission ha: 
announced that “ because of the growing importance of these school 
and of the new requirements which are continually demanded o 
mathematical instruction, it will be necessary to accord in this in| 
quiry a large place to applied mathematics.” 
The following is a synopsis of the elaborate plan of work outlin 
by the commission, which is to be adapted by the national subcom| 
missions to the conditions of the respective countries covered by th 
inquiry: 
GENERAL PLAN OF THE WORK. 
FIRST PART; 
Present state of the organization and the methods of mathematical instructio: 
Sreotron I. The various types of schools.—In this first chapter will be giv 
a concise exposition of the various public institutions of learning in which math} 
matical instruction is given and the aim of each school will be indicat 
Schools for girls will be included. 
The institutions will be distributed according to the following classificatior 
(a) Primary schools, lower and higher. 
(b) Middle schools or higher secondary (lycées, German gymnasiums a 
realschulen, etc.). 
(c) Middle professional schools (technicum, etc.).

It is desirable that this exposition be accompanied by a schematic table giving 
a general view and making evident the succession and correspondence between 
the diverse establishments and indicating also the average age of the students. 
Src. II. Aim of the mathematical instruction and of the separate branches.— 
This question will be studied for the various types of institutions mentioned 
above, taking into account, wherever necessary, applied mathematics, notably 
mechanics. 
Sec. III. The examinations.—It is unquestionable that the system of exami- 
nations has a great influence on the method of instruction. The characteristics 
of the examinations in each category of schools should be concisely indicated, 
and particularly those which lead to “certificates of maturity,” to ‘“ degrees,” 
etc., and the examinations of candidates for teaching. 
Sec. IV. The methods of teaching.—What are the methods used in the various 
institutions, from the primary schools to the higher institutions? Material of 
instruction; mathematical models; use of manuals, text-books, collections of 
problems. Theoretical problems; problems taken from the applied sciences.

PROGRESS OF THE INQUIRY IN THE UNITED STATES. 
The United States members of the commission are Dr. David Eu- 
ene Smith, chairman; Prof. W. F. Osgood, of Harvard University ; 
nd Prof. J. W. A. Young, of the University of Chicago. 
The following statement with respect to the progress of the inquiry 
n this country is furnished by the chairman. At the first general 
eeting of the commission, held at Brussels, August 9, 1910, the

American committee were represented by Prof. C. B. Upton, a mem- 
ber of one of the subcommittees: 
     
                                          
   
       
         
      
      
     They were able to report that the 15 committees to which had been assigned 
the various fields of investigation in this country had their reports nearly ready, 
and that the coming academic year would be devoted to preparing these for 
printing. Each of these communities has worked through subcommittees in the 
securing of material, and the results as thus far submitted are very gratifying. 
This being the first international effort to find out exactly what all countries 
are doing at a given period in the teaching of mathematics in all of the types of 
schools, the methods of procedure have had to be developed with the help of no 
precedents, and hence these methods differ in the different countries. In some 
countries, moreover, the government has come at once to the financial assistance 
of the commissioners, while in others, notably in the United States, the funds 
assigned to educational purposes have permitted of no such help. In this coun- 
try, however, the Bureau of Education has aided the movement in every way, 
furnishing statistical material on which to base several of the reports and 
offering its advice as to methods of procedure. 
The financing of such an important and extensive undertaking has been a 
matter of difficulty, but this difficulty has been met, in part, through the wise 
counsel of Dr. R. S. Woodward, through whose personal initiative several Amer- 
ican universities have contributed to the necessary expenses. It has been im- 
possible, however, to more than meet the expenses of correspondence and 
clerical assistance, and it is a matter of regret that meetings of the several com- 
mittees have been possible only through the financial sacrifice of the members. 
While Germany at once voted 10,000 marks to this purpose, our Government wa: 
able to do nothing. 
It is, however, a matter of congratulation that the work has been pursu 
with such vigor in this country, eliciting the active help of a large number 0: 
our best mathematicians and teachers. 
INTERNATIONAL INTERCHANGE OF STUDENTS. 
The movement for the international interchange of students, whic! 
started in 1909, has taken practical form during the present year 
The purpose of the movement is— 
to provide opportunities for as many as possible of the educated youth of th 
United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom (who, it is reasonable to su 
pose, will become leaders in thought, action, civic and national government i 
the future) to obtain some real insight into the life, customs, and progress 0} 
other nations at a time when their own opinions are forming, with a minimw 
of inconvenience to their academic work, and the least possible expense, with 
view to broadening their conceptions, and rendering them of greater economi| 
and social value, such knowledge being, it is believed, essential for effectu 
leadership. 
With this object in view, it was proposed by the leaders in th 
movement to provide “traveling scholarships for practical observ 
tion in other countries under suitable guidance.” * * * “Tn addi 
tion to academic qualifications, the candidate should be what 
popularly known as an ‘all round’ man, the selection to be along t! 
lines of the Rhodes scholarships.”
-P-A-G-E-171
INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION RELATIONS. 163 
From the outset the enterprise commanded powerful support in 
Great Britain and Canada, and the United Kingdom section was 
organized with the Right Hon. Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal, 
G. C. M. G., chancellor of Aberdeen and McGill (Montreal), univer- 
sities, as president; Sir Charles Eliot, K. C. M. G., vice-chancellor of 
the University of Sheffield, as chairman of the executive committee, 
and a large number of representative men as vice-presidents or mem- 
bers of the general committee. A central office was opened at Caxton 
House, Westminster, London, with Mr. Henry W. Crees as general 
honorable secretary or official chief of the organization. 
As yet the movement has not reached the point of formal organiza- 
tion in the United States, but it has the indorsement of a notable body 
of university men and educational officials. 
According to recent advices, the matter is so far advanced that 
a party of ten university men, under the auspices of the students’ 
traveling bureau, left Liverpool on the 2ist of June for a tour 
of the United States and Canada. The party included representatives 
of Cambridge, Edinburgh, Durham, London, and other universities, 
and their. itinerary included Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, 
Hamilton, Cobalt, Sault Ste. Marie, Fort William, Winnipeg (near 
which city they spent four days at work on farms with a view to 
acquiring some insight into the conditions of Canadian agriculture), 
Madison, Wis. ; Chicago, Ill.; Pittsburg, Pa.; Washington, D. C.; and 
Annapolis Junction, Md. The object of investigation at the last- 
named place was the National Junior Republic. The rest of the jour- 
ney comprised visits to Philadelphia, New York, and Yale and Har- 
vard universities. It is also reported that parties of students from 
Canada and the United States were making tours, under the same 
auspices, in the United Kingdom. 
The realization of the scheme for the present year was made pos- 
sible, it is stated, “by the generosity of a benefactor who wishes to 
remain anonymous.” The American and Colonial clubs, composed 
of Rhodes scholars at Oxford, have passed a resolution strongly 
approving of the aims and objects of the Association for the Inter- 
national Interchange of Students. 
Before efforts are made to obtain permanent endowment for the 
scheme, in an enlarged or revised form, it is proposed that funds shall 
be asked for its maintenance for an experimental period of three 
years, during which its value can be to some extent demonstrated. 
CHINESE STUDENTS. 
By a joint resolution approved May 25, 1908, Congress provided 
for the remission of a portion of the Chinese indemnity for losses 
and expenses sustained during the “Boxer uprising” in China in 
1900. The amount remitted for the year 1910 is $483,094.90.
-P-A-G-E-172
    
164 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
In recognition of this friendly act the Chinese Government de- 
cided to apply this fund to the education of Chinese students in this 
country. In accordance with this decision a large number of Chinese 
students, beneficiaries of the indemnity fund act, have already ar- 
rived in this country and have been assigned to various universities 
and colleges-in the United States. 
      
    
          
   
     
   
   
   
   
    
   
     
      EXCHANGE PROFESSORS. 
In accordance with the agreement entered into in 1904 by the 
University of Berlin and Harvard University for an annual ex-

The Prussian ministry of education on its part established in 
Columbia University the Kaiser Wilhelm professorship of German 
history and institutions, which is filled each year by the trustees of 
Columbia University upon the nomination of the Prussian ministry 
of education. The incumbents of this professorship are required to 
lecture in the English language. The appointments made to this 
professorship have been as follows: 
1906-7 : Hermann Schumacher, ordinary professor of political economy in the

versity of Kiel. 
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler, of the University of California, 
brought his activities as fourth Theodore Roosevelt professor at the 
University of Berlin to a close late in February of the present year. 
His inaugural lecture, delivered on October 30, 1909, discussed the 
subject of “Public opinion as a governing factor in the United 
States.” The general subject of President Wheeler’s public-lecture 
course was “The university in a democracy,” while the seminar 
dealt with “The organization of the higher instruction in the United 
States.” 
Prof. Charles Alphonso Smith, Theodore Roosevelt professor at 
the University of Berlin for the present year, is dean of the graduate 
school of the University of North Carolina. The subject of his lec- 
tures at the University of Berlin is “American literature.” 
The Theodore Roosevelt professor in the University of Berlin ap- 
ointed for 1911-12 is Paul S. Reinsch, Ph. D., professor of political

science in the University of Wisconsin, and well known for his writ- 
ings on questions of public policies. The subject announced for his 
course of lectures at the University of Berlin is “The expansion of 
the United States.” 
The Kaiser Wilhelm professor at Columbia University for 1910-11 
is Dr. Ernst Daenell, of the University of Kiel. Doctor Daenell’s 
literary activity, prior to the appearance of his “ Bliitezeit der 
Deutschen Hanse,” in 1906, was confined mainly to the investigation 
of the history of the German Hanse towns. 
Dr. Max Friedlander, professor of the University of Berlin, dur- 
ing his stay in this country gave a lecture-recital on “ Das Deutsche 
Volkslied,” under the auspices of the Germanistic Society of America, 
on October 21, 1909. This was the first of a series of biweekly lec- 
tures on German music given at Columbia University by the Ger- 
manistic Society in cooperation with extension teaching. (Columbia 
University Quarterly, December, 1909, p. 114.) 
Mr. James H. Hyde, of New York, has maintained since 1903-4 
a resident fellowship in the graduate school of arts and sciences of 
Harvard University, with an annual stipend of $600, the appointment 
to which is to be made by the president and fellows of Harvard Col- 
lege on the recommendation of the minister of public instruction of 
the French Republic. The incumbent for the present year was M. 
Emile Boutroux, member of the “ French Institute.” The lecture- 
ship established by Mr. Hyde at the Sorbonne, Paris, will be filled 
the coming winter by John H. Finley, Ph. D., LL. D., president of 
the College of the City of New York. 
The following announcement appeared in the Harvard Graduates’ 
Magazine, March, 1910, page 456: : 
       
   
   
        
       Two distinguished Hnglishmen are to take part in the university’s programme 0: 
instruction during the second half of the present year. G. W. Prothero, LL. D., 
editor of the Quarterly Review, and formerly professor of history in the Uni. 
versity of Edinburgh, will give a half course on ‘‘ The creation of the Britis! 
Empire,” and Mr. Graham Wallas, a former member of the London schoo 
board and a lecturer in the London School of Economics, is to offer two hal 
courses on English government. 
At the autumn session of the Modern Language Conference, Pro 
Otto Jespersen, of the University of Copenhagen, professor of Englis| 
philology in Columbia University, 1909-10, presented a paper o 
“An artificial international language,” which was discussed by Pro 
fessors Cohn and Remy and other members of the division. 
Prof. Hugo Miinsterberg has been selected by the German Gover 
ment to be Harvard visiting professor at the University of Berlin fo 
1910-11. During his stay in Berlin Professor Miinsterberg wi 
engage also in organizing the work of the newly established Amer 
kanisches Institut in that city.

Prof. Edward Meyer, of the University of Berlin, who was the 
visiting German professor at Harvard for the current year, conducted 
two half courses, one on general Roman history, and another, which 
has been opened to properly qualified school-teachers as well as to 
members of the university, on the history and monuments of the 
ancient East. 
AMERICAN-SCANDINAVIAN EXCHANGE OF PROFESSORS AND 
STUDENTS. 
Through the influence of the American-Scandinavian Society, an 
international organization for cultivating closer relations between 
the Scandinavian countries and the United States, and other agen- 
cies, a movement has been started for an exchange of professors and 
students with Scandinavian countries. Thus far Chancellor Henry 
M. MacCracken, of New York University; President Nicholas M. 
Butler, of Columbia University ; and Dr. Samuel T. Dutton, of Teach- 
ers College, Columbia University, have lectured at Scandinavian uni- 
versities, and Prof. Otto Jespersen, of Copenhagen University, has 
lectured at Columbia. 
During the past year, through the influence of the sa:ne agencies, 
four Scandinavian students were in attendance at American institu- 
tions, three at the Carnegie technical schools in Pittsburg, and one at 
Columbia University. For the latter a graduate fellowship valued at 
$650 was established at Columbia University for the year 1909-10 by 
Mr. Niels Poulson, of Brooklyn, N. Y., and the expenses of the other 
students were provided by the society. On May 26, 1910, the Ameri- 
can-Scandinavian Society received a gift of $100,000 from Mr. Poul- 
son to be held in trust for the furtherance of its educational work. 
The corporation of Harvard University has voted that for a period 
of ten years exemption from tuition fees be granted to advanced 
students from Scandinavian universities, not exceeding three students 
in any year, who may be nominated by their respective universities 
and recommended by the American-Scandinavian Society. 
INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL OF PEACE. 
The creation of The Hague Tribunal was the entering wedge in the 
movement for international peace. Since the founding of that tri- 
bunal a propaganda for peace has been carried on by various agencies 
in Europe and America, prominent among which may be mentioned 
the Lake Mohonk Peace Conferences. The Mohonk conferences 
stimulated Mr. Edwin Ginn, of the firm of Ginn & Co., publishers, to 
give generously to the cause of peace. 
The establishment of the International School of Peace was made 
possible by the munificence of Mr. Ginn, who has set aside $50,000 a 
year for this purpose and proposes eventually to endow the institu-
-P-A-G-E-176
  
168 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
tion. In a letter to the Nation, September 23, 1909, the founder out- 
lines to some extent the proposed organization of the school and 
indicates various activities which the institution may undertake. 
Since the letter was written the school has been incorporated; books, 
periodicals, and pamphlet literature on the subject of peace have been 
collected, and a bureau of information has been established. 
Mr. Ginn advocates also the inauguration of a bureau of education 
in connection with the school, which— 
    
                     
     
                     
      
   
    
     should attempt to modify the courses of study in our schools, colleges, and 
universities by eliminating the use of such literature and history as tend to 
inculcate unduly the military spirit and to exaggerate the achievements of war. 
Too much of our history is now devoted to accounts of battles and to the ex- 
ploits of war heroes; too little respect and attention are directed to the unselfish 
and self-sacrificing lives of thousands of noble men and women who have striven 
and achieved mightily for the benefit of the race in the fields of peace. 
He recommends the international exchange of teachers and 
students— 
in accordance with the ideas which underlie the Rhodes scholarships, and the 
recent exchange of professors between Germany and America should be further 
extended, even among the teachers of our public schools. 
In his opinion “ one of the present great dangers of war is to be 
found in false, misleading, and inflammatory statements about inter- 
national relations.” To offset these conditions Mr. Ginn proposes 
the equipment of an editorial corps, in connection with the educa- 
tional bureau of the school, “ to furnish constantly to the press of the 
world material which would make for peace.” He also advocates the 
cooperation of the clergy in the peace movement, as well as chambers 
of commerce and other similar associations. 
In this connection he says: 
Is it not worth while for the governments of the world seriously to consider 
the establishment of a school for the education of their servants, and a bureau, 
under the control of a cabinet officer, whose duty it should be to study broadly 
international relations looking toward the peaceful development of each nation? 
He argues for the institution of a political bureau, which should 
employ— 
men of statesmanlike grasp and power in all the main capitals of the world, 
to watch over the course of legislation and to work for the reduction of 
armaments. 
An advisory council, consisting of men well known in the peace 
movement, he recommends, to assist the executive committee of the 
school. 
AMERICAN SCHOOL PEACE LEAGUE.

Union, and its plan is to organize state branches. Mrs. Fanny Fern 
Andrews, Boston, Mass., is the secretary. Plans are being formu- 
lated for the establishment of an International School Peace League, 
of which the American School Peace League will be the American 
branch. The league offers prizes for essays on topics relating to the 
opportunity and duty of the schools in the peace movement, interna- 
tional arbitration, patriotism, and allied subjects.

to the scholastic and social problems of common interest to the coun- 
tries participating in their deliberations. The present year has been 
prolific in gatherings of this nature, a large number having been 
convened as adjuncts to the International Exposition at Brussels. 
INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON HOME EDUCATION. 
The Third International Congress on Home Education was held 
in Brussels August 21 to 25. The general object of this series of con- 
gresses is to discuss the best means of promoting the physical, moral, 
and intellectual well-being of children under home influences. The 
initial congress was held at Liege in connection with the Universal 
Exposition of 1905. As a result of the interest thus awakened a per- 
manent commission was formed to provide for subsequent congresses, 
and preparations were at once begun for the second congress, which 
was held at Milan in 1906. 
The organizing committee made elaborate preparations for the 
hird congress, and were greatly aided in the preliminary work by 
he auxiliary committees formed in all the leading countries to pro- 
ote its interests. In accordance with a request made to the Secre- 
ary of State by Baron Moncheur, the Belgian minister at Washing- 
on, the Commissioner of Education secured the cooperation of an 
meriean committee with Dr. W. V. O’Shea, of the University of 
isconsin, who rendered important service in a similar capacity in 
reparation for the first congress of the series, as chairman, and Dr. 
W. C. Bagley, of the University of Illinois, as secretary. Associated 
ith these gentlemen was a company of men and women each of 
hom is a recognized authority in some one of the subjects covered

lhe United States played an important part both in the preliminary 
easures and the final proceedings of the congress. International congresses are assuming more and more the compre-*

N. J.; and Dr. Rudolph R. Reeder, superintendent of the New York 
Orphan Asylum, Hastings-on-Hudson, N. Y. 
At a business session of the Home Education Congress it wa 
decided to hold the next meeting in the United States. The follow-

before the school age, education during school age, education afte 
school age, abnormal children, and various subjects bearing on infanc’ 
The subsections or titles under which the papers were presente

THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON POPULAR EDUCATION. 
The Congress on Home Education was followed by the Thir 
International Congress on Popular Education, organized by the Lig 
belge de l’Enseignement, which association has long advocated i 
Belgium the most liberal and progressive ideas on the subject 
popular education. In preparation for this congress the league se 
out an elaborate, but well-classified, questionnaire covering the pro 
lems of popular education which are pressing for solution at t 
present time in the leading countries of Europe and America. T' 
congress was organized in sections corresponding to the divisions 
this comprehensive inquiry, and hence the report of the proceedin 
promises a body of information of timely interest to educators a 
legislators concerned in measures for the welfare of the young. T 
United States was represented at the congress by numerous de!

with the collaboration of Solvay Institute (Institut de sociologie 
Solvay) of the University of Brussels, commands unusual facilities 
for collating and publishing a bibliography of the scientific study 
of childhood, which is part of its proposed work. 
At the seat of the society in Brussels * a bureau of pedotechnic con- 
sultations is maintained where, under the regular oversight of Doctor 
Henrotin, mothers are instructed in the care of their babes. Several 
nurslings are also taken at one time for complete care and examina- 
tion as to conditions of growth, nourishment, ete. 
The growing interest in the scientific study of childhood is illus- 
trated, also, by the formation of an international committee for the 
organization of international congresses of pedology. The prelimi- 
nary action in this matter was taken at the meeting of a provisional 
committee held at Geneva (island Rousseau) in August, 1909. 
Other recent congresses pertaining to popular education, whose 
reports promise matters of interest, are: 
SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELEMENTARY 
EDUCATION. 
This conference was held in Paris, August 4-7, 1910, at the Sor- 
bonne. These conferences are organized by the international com- 
mittee of teachers’ federations (Bureau International des Fédérations 
d’Instituteurs), consisting of representatives of the various associa- 
tions of teachers throughout Europe and in French colonies. 
Since its formation in 1905, the permanent committee has held 
annual meetings, and has formulated a definite plan of continuous 
work for the purpose as expressed in its constitution : 
Of forming close bonds of friendship between its members and of interna- 
tional solidarity, contributing to the progress of popular education, promoting 
the moral and material welfare of teachers, and establishing peace and frater- 
nity among the nations represented. 
The general conferences, of which the first was held at Liege in 
1905, are called to consider topics which have been the subject of 
special investigation by the permanent committee. The facts and 
opinions thus accumulated are published in advance of the confer- 
ences in order that the discussions may embody the views of the par- 
ticipants as supported by evidence. The programme of the con- 
ference for the present year included the following subjects: 
1. (@) Educational result in different countries as displayed by statistics, 
(b) Compulsory attendance—its necessity. Conditions which lead to imperfect 
attendance where compulsion is legalized—suggested remedies.

2. Aim and object of elementary science teaching in primary schools—meth- 
ods and curriculum. 
3. The professional training of the teaching staff and the professional train- 
ing of the staff engaged in the work of inspection and administration. 
4. Educational continuation work in various countries, duty of public bodies, 
duty of the teacher, duty of the private individual.     
                   
           
    
    
         
     
         
    
   Under the head of educational results, the committee had endeay- 
ored to collate statistics showing the average age for the withdrawal 
of pupils from primary schools in different countries; although much 
interesting information was thus brought together, it was found 
quite impossible to institute comparisons in this respect on account 
of the different terms of classification, methods of reporting, etc., 
employed in different countries. This failure emphasizes the im- 
portance of a uniform statistical scheme of wide application, such 
as has been repeatedly urged by the United States Commissioner of 
Education. 
In a paper on “Motherhood, the home, and medical inspection,” 
Mrs. Cloudesley Brereton, an English delegate, whose recent book @ 
entitles her to rank as the chief authority on this topic, struck the 
keynote of that relation between the home and the school which it is 
one purpose of this congress to establish. In the opinion of Mrs. 
Brereton— 
the mothers are the very foundation of successful medical inspection. * * * 
The schools are the most rational and convenient centers from which to work 
where children are concerned, but there is already a grave danger that parents 
should think that, as the schools are so ready to shoulder the burden of par- 
ents, they can themselves lay every parental burden down. 
That is just what would be fatal, not merely because the schools have no| 
right to make the parents think that they have no responsibilities, but because 
if the parents do not cooperate with the medical authorities the work of the 
latter will be worse than wasted. If there is no workable means of contact] 
between the school and the home, the school doctor and the mother, the 
expense and experience of medical inspection will be largely thrown away. 
The paper was not only a graphic presentation of the part th 
home, and even the humblest home, must play in the endeavor t 
educate “the sanitary conscience” of the nation, but it was full o 
pertinent suggestions of the cooperative and definite missionar 
effort which society, as a rule, must bring to bear upon that pivota 
center. 
In this connection Mrs. Brereton said: 
The various parents’ societies and child-study societies will doubtless in th 
near future realize how much they can learn from men and women intereste 
in medical inspection of schools; and much is to be expected of those now powe 
ful national and international societies. The women who belong to them a 
active workers, like the women on our various voluntary committees, are les 
and less, as years go on, mere amiable amateurs; there is an increasing numbe} 
of highly skilled public workers, who only need to find suitable and organiz

outlets for that skill and experience which they so unselfishly place at the 
service of the public. 
In conclusion, it is surely a sign of the times that we are seeing the establish- 
ment of school créches, where the babies of the home are supplying the link 
between home and school, between lessons and life. Instead of the children’s 
staying at home to mind the baby, the baby goes to the créche, and girls of 
school-leaving age are instructed by capable nurses in the care of these babies 
of their own class; and the boys in the carpentering shops may be taught to 
make simple cradles from old crates for twopence, to make wholesome little 
mattresses of sawdust, and so on. 
This type of training between the ages of 14 and 16, those years which are 
generally spent in forgetting everything learnt at school instead of in applying 
it—the years spent too often in developing the hooligan and the apache—bid 
fair instead to be spent in manufacturing capable potential parents and useful 
citizens,    
   
                  
   
       
    
         
     
    
     
    
       
    
       
   
    SIXTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON ESPERANTO. 
At the sessions of the Sixth International Congress on Esperanto, 
hich met in Washington August 14 to 20, 1910, much interest and 
nthusiasm were manifested, and substantial progress in extending 
he use of the language was reported. The inventor of Esperanto, 
ctor Zamenhof, and various official delegates from foreign coun- 
ries participated in the proceedings. The Bureau of Education was 
epresented by Dr. John D, Wolcott. 
INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON ENTOMOLOGY. 
The International Congress on Entomology which was held in 
russels August 1-6, 1910, although strictly scientific in its nature, 
ay properly be included under the head of congresses pertaining to 
igher education, as it was a gathering of scientists representing the 
rincipal universities and scientific societies of the world. Its 
embership reached a total of 202, of whom a large proportion (67) 
presented Great Britain. The United States was represented by 
r. W. Holland from the Carnegie Institute, acting also as co-dele- 
te for the Entomological Society of America with Prof. Herbert 
sborn and Dr. H. Skinner. The latter, who was a delegate also 
om the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, excited much, 
terest by a paper reviewing the history of entomology in the 
nited States in the last one hundred years. As an illustration of 
e economic value of entomological investigations, Doctor Skinner 
lled attention to the fact that— 
State of Massachusetts has spent a million dollars on its campaign against 
gipsy moth, which has devastated a hundred square miles and done some 
000,000 dollars worth of damage, and the United States Government has 
ipropriated 300,000 dollars to the work of confining its damage to the locality 
preventing its spread to adjoining States. 
It was decided that the Second International Entomological Con- 
less should be held in the summer of 1912, and the representatives

invitation to that old university town, which proposition was unani- 
mously accepted. 
        
   
   
   
    
     
   
    
   
    
     
       
    
       
   
   
      INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON HIGHER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. 
An International Congress on Higher Technical Education wa 
held at Brussels, September 9 to 12 of the present year, under th 
patronage of the King of Belgium. The programme of the congres 
was drawn up by eminent representatives of the specialties to b 
considered and every effort had been made to secure the partici 
pation of delegates from the leading countries of the world, thor 
oughly experienced in the conduct of technical education and enter 
prises. The papers presented before the congress and the discus 
sions which they called forth have just been published, but to 
late for full consideration in this report. They comprise informatio 
and opinions of importance to those engaged in the conduct of highe 
technical education. 
The congress was marked by the active participation of representa 
tives of technical education in the smaller kingdoms of Europ 
Among these should be included Spain, in which there is a marke 
awakening in the problems of technical education. 
Doctor Tombo, one of the three national delegates from th 
United States, in a brief note on the subject, calls especial attentio 
to the announcement of the Ecole de Commerce of the University 0 
Brussels, and, in connection therewith, to two of the papers pr 
sented at the congress, viz: “La formation des ingénieurs co: 
merciaux & l’Ecole de Commerce Solvay,” annexed to the Unive: 
sity of Brussels, and “ L’ingénieur commercial et l’économie ni 
tionale” (by Prof. Méhely of Hungary); and to a paper on t 
“Création en Belgique d’un Institut spécial d’enseignement tec 
nique des transports” (by Carlier), which contained reference, als 
to American conditions and to the lively interest manifested j 
respect to the practical spirit in which Americans approach tec 
nical problems. 
The following persons were accredited as national delegates fro; 
the United States: Dr. Edwin G. Cooley, La Grange, Ill.; Dr. Ric 
ard C. Maclaurin, president of the Massachusetts Institute of Tec! 
nology, Boston; and Dr. Rudolf Tombo, jr., adjunct professor 
Germanic languages and literatures, Columbia University, N 
York city. 
INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES. 
In addition to the congresses relating immediately to educatio 
subjects, several important congresses have been held during the ye 
for the consideration of governmental and social problems, as regar|

both their educational and public bearing. In this group belongs the 
International Congress on Administrative Sciences, which was held 
July 28 to 81, inclusive, under the patronage of the Belgian Govern- 
ment. The congress emphasizes the fact that a new order of adminis- 
trative ability and of preparation for public service is required by 
the increased scope and complexity of public affairs. This demand 
has led, in the principal countries, to the creation of university facul- 
ties or courses of instruction pertaining to political and administra- 
tive sciences, and to the institution of special diplomas as the sanction 
of the new order of studies. 
The public interest in the subject has led several cities to organize 
exhibitions of municipal activities. Dresden has maintained such 
an exhibition for several years; the Netherland federation of munici- 
pal secretaries and officials organized an exposition of this character 
in 1906; a similar exhibit formed a feature of the Brussels Exposition 
of the present year. 
It appeared, therefore, to the leaders in the enterprise, that the 
time had come when the interests of public administration might 
properly be made the subject of an international congress, affording 
opportunity for formulating the most important administrative prob- 
lems and for the interchange of views and experiences bearing upon 
their solution. 
The programme, which was arranged with reference to interests 
common to all countries that are in the current of modern life, com- 
prised four divisions, as follows: Municipal or local administration; 
relations between central and local administrations; general ques- 
tions; circular forms and publications pertaining to the adminis- 
trative service. 
The plans for the congress were admirably developed and carried 
lout so successfully that the principal countries of Europe, and the 
nited States, were all represented at the congress by strong dele- 
ations. 
In the section of local or communal administration (municipal and 
ural), attention was given to hygiene and sanitation, and public re- 
ponsibility for these services was fully recognized. Intimately 
elated to these considerations was that of municipal embellishments 
nd the preservation of historic monuments as a means of artistic cul- 
ure and patriotic inspiration. Labor problems and their solution 
yy communal or socialistic control were discussed from various stand- 
oints. ; 
It is noticeable that this comprehensive programme makes no refer- 
nce to problems of race education and the government of undeveloped 
eoples by the stronger powers which, in acute forms, are thrust upon 
urselves at the present time.

professor of political science, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL; 
Dr. Frank J. Goodnow, professor of administrative law and munici- 
pal science, Columbia University, New York City; and Dr. Charles

INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF ACADEMIES.    
     
   
   
               
        
       
     
   
       
   
   
       The International Association of Academies was inaugurated ten 
years ago in a preliminary meeting held at Wiesbaden, and since then 
regular triennial assemblies have taken place in Paris, London, 
Vienna, and finally in Rome, where the fourth meeting was held 
May 9-14, 1910, under the presidency of Prof. P. Blaserna, of the 
Accademia dei Lincei. 
From an account of this meeting by Dr. Arthur Schuster, a delegate 
from the British Royal Society, the following particulars are taken: 
In judging of the past activity and the prospects of the association it must be 
borne in mind that, having no funds at its disposal, its influence must be mainly 
a moral one. It is intended to coordinate international enterprises, to initiate 
and encourage undertakings, and to act as an advisory body where advice is| 
asked for, either by governments or by the many special international organiza- 
tions which have recently sprung up. 
* * * * * * * 
That part of the association’s work which prevents the overlapping of inter- 
national enterprises has been illustrated in Rome by the manner in which th 
proposal of the Swedish Academy to take international action toward the pre: 
vention of the diseases of cultivated plants was dealt with. Everyone agre 
that the subject was a most important one and fell within the province of thi 
association, but there is in Rome an international agricultural institute whic 
might be expected to include remedial measures against the diseases of plant: 
within its range of activity. Apparently, however, there are difficulties whic! 
have prevented the agricultural institute from attacking the problem; thes| 
are partly financial, but partly also due to the terms of the convention unde 
which the institute was founded. After a full discussion the representative 
the Swedish Academy accepted the following resolution, which was propos 
by Colonel Prain, one of the representatives of the Royal Society : 
“The International Association of Academies of Science, while in enti 
sympathy with the proposal that further international cooperation in the stu 
of plant diseases is necessary, considers that the question of deciding wh: 
ought to be done in the direction of combating these diseases might appropr| 
ately be intrusted to the International Agricultural Institute. 
“Tn the event of its being found that the terms of the convention of 190; 
under which it was established, prevent the international institute from exten 
ing its activities so far as is desired in the interests of science and agricultu 
this association recommends that the constituent academies bring to the noti: 
of their respective governments the desirability of conferring adequate powe: 
upon the International Agricultural Institute.” 
* * * * * * * 
The association has further interested itself in the publication of the collect 
works of Leibnitz, which is being promoted jointly by the academies of Pa

       ‘and Berlin, and in that of Euler’s works, which has been undertaken by the 
Société helvetique des Sciences Naturelles. The association has more especially 
approved at its recent meeting the decision to publish all memoirs in their 
original language. It may seem strange that such approval should be necessary, 
but it was called for by attempts that had been made to persuade the Swiss 
society to translate the Latin writings into a modern language. 
A few words should perhaps be said on the literary side of the work of the 
association. The subjects dealt with included the preparation of an edition of 
the “ Mahabharata,” and of an “ Encyclopedia of Islam,” of Greek documents, 
and of a “ Corpus Medicorum Antiquorum; ’”’ further, the very difficult question 
of an international exchange—by way of loan—of manuscripts belonging to 
public libraries,

At present the association has no legal status, not being subject to the laws 
of any country. It can not therefore accept any legacies, and it is rumored 
that it has lost in consequence a very considerable sum of money. * * * 
In order to evade the difficulty at present preventing the association from hay- 
ing funds of its own the committees of the association at a meeting held last 
year, at which nearly all the academies were represented, passed a unanimous 
resolution recommending that the different academies should declare themselves 
ready to accept legacies or gifts to be held in trust by them for the purposes of 
the association. When this resolution came up for discussion at the present 
meeting, objections were raised by several delegates, and the matter had to he 
referred to the several academies for an authoritative expression of opinion.* 
WORLD’S CONGRESS OF INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS. 
The World’s Congress of International Associations was held at 
[Brussels May 9-11, 1910. M. Beernaert, minister of state, who pre- 
ided, was surrounded by a number of distinguished scientific men 
f Belgium and of foreign countries. 
In his opening address Minister Beernaert called attention to the 
rst congress of this nature, which was held at Mons in 1905. On that 
ccasion it was resolved to form a central office of international asso- 
iations, which appointed the committee of arrangement for the 
resent congress. 
The object of the World’s Congress of International Associations 
s the study of international organization in all domains and under 
ll forms—science and art, law and political organizations, social 
ork, and the field of economics. : 
The questions submitted for the present congress were as follows: 
1. The cooperation of international associations. 
2. The legal regulations for international associations. 
3. The international systems of units applicable to the sciences and 
chnical professions (unification and coordination of systems, the 
etric system, the system of C. G. S.). 
The following persons were accredited as national delegates from 
e United States: Dr. Julius Sachs, professor of secondary educa-

FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS FOR PUBLIC RELIEF AND 
PRIVATE CHARITY. 
The Fifth International Congress for Public Relief and Private 
Charity was opened August 9 at Copenhagan, in the presence of the 
King and Queen, the Crown Prince, and the principal ministers of 
the Kingdom. Although not strictly an educational congress, its 
deliberations pertained to problems many of which are fundamental to 
the welfare of children, and consequently school officers and teachers 
were invited, with the representatives of reformatory and penal in- 
stitutions, to take part in its proceedings. Miss Julia Lathrop, of 
Rockport, Ind., long identified with important measures pertaining 
to the care and protection of children in that State, was accredited 
as a national representative from the United States, 
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS. 
The Eighteenth Universal Peace Congress was opened at Stock-| 
holm August 1. It was attended by nearly 500 members, includin, 
many women, representing 22 nations and nearly all the peace asso: 
ciations of the world. 
Count Taube, minister of foreign affairs, welcomed the members i: 
the name of the King of Sweden and the Swedish Government, an: 
in the course of his address defined the purposes of the assembly a: 
follows: “To impress on the nations the solidarity of the brother 
hood of man, to make love prevail over hatred, right over might, an 
the blessings of peace over the horrors of war.” 
THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON SCHOOL HYGIENE. 
The organization of congresses to deal with the special problem: 
of school hygiene is due to the initiative of Dr. Hermann Gries| 
bach, of the University of Basel, Switzerland, whose efforts in thi 
direction resulted in the First Congress on School Hygiene, held i 
Nuremburg in April, 1904. This was followed by a second congres 
held in London in August, 1907, which afforded proof of progress il 
all the countries represented in regard both to general interest in th| 
subject and in practical measures for improving the hygienic cond 
tion of schools and safeguarding the health of school children. 
According to the resolution adopted at the second congress, tl 
Third International Congress on School Hygiene was held at Pa: 
August 2 to 7 of the present year. The minister of public instru 
tion, who had accepted the honorary presidency of the congress, us 
his influence to promote its interests, and the various societies whi
-P-A-G-E-187

are occupied in France with questions of the hygiene of childhood 
and the improvement of educational conditions combined to insure 
its success. The president of the organizing committee was Dr. Al- 
bert Mathieu, distinguished for his service in the hospitals of Paris, 
president of the permanent international committee on school hy- 
giene, and also of the French association of school hygiene (Ligue 
d’Hygiéne scolaire). The general secretary of the committee was 
Doctor Dufestel, medical inspector of schools, Paris. The secretary of 
the committee in charge of preparations for the exposition auxiliary 
to the congress was M. V. H. Friedel, of the Musée pédagogique. 
Besides the central committee at Paris, branch committees were 
formed in the principal cities of the provinces to draw support to the 
congress, and auxiliary committees were formed for the same pur- 
pose in foreign countries. By these admirable preliminary measures 
not only was the success of the congress assured, but the widest pub- 
licity was given to the subjects which were to engage its attention 
and an interest excited in its proceedings which extended far beyond 
the membership of the congress. 
The programme of the congress formed, as it were, an index to the 
accumulated body of facts and opinions developed by scientific inves- 
tigations which are profoundly modifying the processes and ideals of 
elementary schools. : 
The following-named specialists represented the United States 
Bureau of Education at the congress: Dr. Arthur T. Cabot, fellow of 
Harvard University; Dr. Thomas F. Harrington, director of school 
hygiene, Boston, Mass.; and Dr. R. Tait McKenzie, professor of 
physical education, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pa. 
The Congress on Physical Education, held at Brussels August 10 
to 13, dealt with subjects closely related to the above.. The delegates 
from the United States accredited to this congress by the Department 
f State were the specialists named above, who represented the 
ureau of Education at the congress on school hygiene, together 
ith Dr. H. M. Bracken, secretary and executive officer of the 
innesota state board of health. : 
Reports of the two congresses, from the American delegates, will be 
ound in Chapter XVI.

PART I. EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION, SIXTY-FIRST CONGRESS. 
First Session. 
The tariff law of 1909, enacted during an extraordinary session of 
the Sixty-first Congress, contains provisions for the admission, free of 
duty, of books, maps, charts, etc., and philosophical and scientific 
apparatus and instruments, etc., imported for the use and by the 
order of any religious, educational, or scientific institution or society. 
(Paragraphs 519 and 650.) A “deficiency bill’ also was passed at 
this session, containing the following appropriations: For completing 
the new building for the National Museum, $80,068.41; for the 
support of inmates of the National Training School for Boys, $3,000; 
for the balance of the salary of the register of copyrights, in the 
Library of Congress, $500. 
Second Session. 
APPROPRIATIONS. 
The sum contributed by the United States Government during 
1910 to the advancement of education was far in excess of the amount 
stated in the following summary, namely $17,565,981.26. This is 
181  
-P-A-G-E-190
  182 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
the aggregate of the cash appropriations of the second session of the 
Sixty-first Congress, together with certain moneys expended under 
continuing appropriations of previous Congresses. The contribution 
to colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts is an example of such 
an appropriation. But in addition to these.sums there were many 
items of which it is impossible to determine the amount, even in the 
maintenance of national institutions. 
The instruction in the United States Military and Naval academies 
is given largely by officers detailed from the regular service. Their 
compensation is paid from the appropriations for the pay of the army 
and of the navy, respectively, and no reasonable effort can determine 
the amount of it. The salaries and allowances of officers detailed 
to colleges and military schools make an item of considerable impor- 
tance, but this can not be included for a similar reason. 
Large appropriations are made annually for scientific investiga- 
tions of an educational character which are not included in the figures 
presented because of the difficulty of separating scientific from 
administrative work. 
Appropriations of land are necessarily omitted, for no estimate of 
its value could approach correctness. The aggregate upon any basis 
of calculation is large, whether considered as a principal sum or in 
respect to the net proceeds for any one year. 
The endowment of schools in the new States of Arizona and New 
Mexico, as explained under miscellaneous enactments, which follow, 
is liberal to a degree, though they are not the first to enjoy such 
liberality. Five per cent of the net proceeds of sales of public lands 
within the States will be devoted to schools in addition to four sections 
in each township, and large grants besides to individual institutions. 
Eight States in the Union have a total land area less than that granted 
outright to the educational system of each of these new States; and 
the four smallest States combined, namely, Rhode Island, Delaware, 
Connecticut, and New Jersey, would not make a principality as great 
as that which will endow the schools of New Mexico.

     PART II. RECENT EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION, STATE AND 
TERRITORIAL. 
  
Introduction. 
The legislatures of twelve States have been in regular session during 
he year 1910: Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachu- 
etts, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, South 
arolina, and Virginia. In addition to these the general assembly of 
linois met in special session, and the fifth legislative assembly of 
orto Rico convened on January 10 and adjourned March 10. The 
wwenty-first biennial session of the general assembly of Vermont 
ill begin in October, 1910, too late for its proceedings to be included 
this chapter. 
Common schools, compulsory school attendance, child labor, the 
rotection of neglected and ill-treated children, and the detention 
nd reformation of juvenile delinqucnts have become so intertwined 
their interests and agencies that it is now practically impossible 
o separate the general treatment of one from the other. Attend- 
nce enforced by law is the natural sequel to the maintenance of 
chools from public funds, and is now considered a necessary con- 
lomitant to the public school system; the restriction of child labor 
essential to compulsory attendance; the recognition of truancy  
-P-A-G-E-200

as an offense akin to crime, and the evident impracticability of 
bringing vicious and depraved children into contact with innocent 
children in the ordinary school classes involve a new relationship 
between the schools and custodial institutions; the interference with 
school attendance and with scholastic efficiency, that results from 
cruelty and neglect, not only gives to the teacher a direct interest 
in the home life of his pupil, but it is also a matter of increased con- 
cern to the community and the State which undertakes to prepare 
its children for useful citizenship through education. Thus it 
happens that officers employed originally for school work find them- 
selves latterly in direct and vital connection with agencies which, 
though in a sense auxiliary to the main purpose of general instruction, 
are more properly social than educational in their character. 
Furthermore, custodial institutions are becoming constantly more 
educational than penal. Until the establishment of the House of 
Refuge for Juvenile Delinquents in New York in 1825 instruction for 
convicted youthful offenders was a thing unknown in this country, and 
was then practiced in only a few recently established institutions in 
Europe. But the idea of reformation through education has devel- 
oped, and its application has been extended until the detention o 
children for any offense is now invariably made the means by whic 
they may be effectively instructed without injury to more innocen 
or more fortunate children. The juvenile courts are but the conduit: 
through which this class of children pass from one form of compul 
sory education to another. 
One result of these changed conditions is the coordination of effort 
that relate to the welfare of children generally, and of agencies whic 
have useful citizenship as their object. Regulation of child labor 
prevention of cruelty, protection from evil influences, and reforma, 
tion of delinquents are not merely related to the public-school system 
all are essential parts of the same scheme of education for the goo 
of the State. 
This view has been markedly prevalent in the past few years, an 
in 1910 the several legislatures have been more than usually activ 
in making laws for the welfare of children, such activity beiug s 
pronounced as to be easily the most conspicuous feature of the legi 
lation of the year. Ten of the twelve regular sessions were marke: 
by such laws. 
Kentucky, New York, Rhode Island, and Virginia passed laws pr 
viding a penalty for neglecting, abandoning, maltreating, or exposi 
to crime any child under a specified age. Laws to this effect ha 
become well-nigh universal, and the most of them have been pass 
within ten years. Asylums have been provided for abandon 
children and punishment has been meted out to juvenile delinquen 
for many years, but strangely enough it has been but recently th

EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION, 1938 
such laws as these have been in existence to punish the adults who — 
were primarily responsible for the conditions. 
The influence of the national child-labor committee may be clearly 
seen in the new laws relating to child labor. By means of its excel- 
lent organization and energetic methods, and with the cooperation 
of state and local child-labor committees, this association has become 
an influence of great power for good. Its officers have interested 
themselves particularly during the past year in removing the tempta- 
tions of messenger boys, and have been instrumental in the passage 
of laws in New York, Maryland, and Ohio, restricting the employ- 
ment of boys for night service. A similar law failed by a narrow 
margin in Georgia. 
Improved messenger laws were but one of the objects of the 
activity of the association, however, and it is undoubtedly true that 
not a bill was introduced in any legislature during the year tending 
to the improvement of the conditions surrounding child labor to 
which the national child-labor committee did not render material 
aid. 
Agriculture has also been prominent in legislative deliberations 
during 1910. New York, Virginia, and Mississippi made provisions for 
extensive systems of high schools, and Massachusetts instituted an 
investigation with the same end in view. Louisiana made agriculture 
a required study in all schools, and Maryland authorized the county 
school commissioners to do so in their respective counties. Maryland 
also authorized the establishment of county industrial schools for 
colored youth, in which agriculture will be taught, and placed the 
same subject in the course of all county high schools as an alternative 
with commerical studies. 
High schools were the subject of important and favorable legislation 
in Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, and Ohio, the enactments in 
eorgia and Maryland being particularly significant. 
The favor accorded to the consolidation of rural schools continues, 
nd Mississippi, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia 
laced new laws upon the statute books encouraging such action. 
A further tendency to smaller school boards for city districts has 
een shown in the reorganization of the boards of Louisville, Ky.; New- 
on, Mass, and certain New York cities. The new law for Louisville 
s along the line of recent ideas in city organization, involving a 
eparation of pedagogical from business affairs, placing the former 
nm charge of the superintendent and the latter in the hands of a 
irector. Including school employees in the classified civil service 
an innovation in Ohio which will attract a full share of attention. 
Public playgrounds are upon a better basis in Massachusetts, Vir- 
inia, and New York in consequence of recent laws. Special com-

missions to administer them are contemplated in the first two States, 
in both of which the new laws are drawn with special reference to 
cities, while in New York the provision is intended to apply to less 
populous districts. 
New York has made a beginning in pensioning teachers at state 
expense, being the third State to do so. The present provisions 
relate to teachers in state institutions only, and not to teachers in the 
public schools generally, as in Rhode Island and Maryland, but the 
action is significant nevertheless. Important amendments to 
retirement laws are reported from Massachusetts (relating to Boston), 
Ohio, and Virginia, all of them inuring to the substantial benefit of 
the retiring teacher. 
In relation to supervision, the new laws of New York are of the 
first importance. The enlarged powers of the state commissioner 
of education and the increased number of local superintendents 
will, it is expected, add much to the efficiency of the state organization. 
The constant extension of the observance of ‘Columbus Day,” 
October 12, as a legal holiday is an interesting fact in recent legislation. 
Four additional States have ordained its observance, not simply as a 
day for commemorative exercises in the schools, but as a public 
holiday for the people of the entire State, involving the closing of 
banks, public offices, etc. 
        
    
       
   
              
   
              
     
      
    SUMMARY OF LEGISLATION BY STATES. 
GEORGIA. 
In Georgia an amendment to the state constitution has been sub- 
mitted to popular vote by the general assembly which marks one of 
the most important steps since the establishment of the public-school 
system of that State, namely, the elimination of the provision 
restricting county taxation to elementary schools. The effect of this 
provision has been that while the cities might maintain high schools, 
the counties could not, and the rural districts were wholly without 
the benefits of public secondary education. The unusual spectacl 
was presented of a State maintaining elementary schools and 
university, but without a connecting link between them. Wit! 
the ratification of the proposed amendment, however, this State will 
like the rest, offer to its sons continuous instruction of all grades 
or at least there will be no legal obstacle to the establishment o: 
schools of all grades.’   
@The Rhode Island law covers teachers in the public schools or in such other schools as are supporte 
wholly or in part by state appropriations and are entirely managed and controlled by the State. In Mary, 
land any person who has taught in any of the public or normal schools of the State iseligible, under specifies 
conditions, to a pension at state expense. The essential provisions of the New York law are set forth 
‘page 205 of this chapter. 
>The amendment has been ratified.

  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION, 195 
Another important constitutional amendment was proposed in 
the legislature and was vigorously pressed, but it failed by a narrow 
margin to secure the required two-thirds vote. This related to com- 
pulsory education. The fact that a majority of the members of the 
legislature voted in favor of such a measure is in itself an indication 
of a marked change in the public sentiment of the State.     
   
   
                          
    
           
   
    
   
    ILLINOIS. 
Only two laws relating to education were passed at the special 
session of 1910, one providing that the annual library tax in cities of 
over 1,500 inhabitants shall not be included in the limit of taxation 
fixed by law, and the other granting a tract of land 950 by 2,000 feet, 
now under the waters of Lake Michigan, to the Field Museum of 
Natural History. 
KENTUOKY. 
In Kentucky the report of the commission constituted two years 
ago to revise and codify the school laws failed of adoption, but a 
number of noteworthy laws were enacted. The compulsory educa- 
tion acts relating to cities were strengthened, and the period of 
required attendance was extended so as to cover children between 
14 and 16 years of age who have not received an employment certifi- 
cate under the child-labor laws. The last-named laws were also 
amended to include employment of children between 14 and 16 in 
business offices, telegraph offices, hotels, etc., and the work of issuing 
employment certificates was placed in the hands of school officers. 
The most extensive change in school organization which was 
effected by this legislature related to the system of text-book selec- 
tion. The state text-book commission was abolished and a com- 
mission was constituted in each county to select the books to be used 
in their respective counties and to handle the details of contracts, 
distribution, and the like in pursuance of the law. The new system, 
however, is not wholly a local system, for the books must be selected 
from lists authorized by the state board of education, and effective 
supervision by the state superintendent is apparently provided. 
The Kentucky library commission, also created by the last legisla- 
ture, should have a beneficent influence in the State. It is charged 
with the duty of assisting and advising school and public libraries, 
and may operate traveling libraries, conduct courses of library 
instruction, and hold librarians’ institutes. 
A new law relating to the board of education of the city of Louisville 
was passed, involving a radical change in the constitution of that 
body and bringing it in line with recent tendencies in city school 
organization. The number of members is reduced from sixteen to 
five, all being elected from the city at large instead of from the several 
ards. The superintendent is to have control, under direction of  
-P-A-G-E-204
ae ee ee 
196 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910, 
the board, of matters relating to instruction, nominates teachers and 
supervisors, recommends text-books, and the like. A business 
director is charged with the care of the property of the board and has 
supervision of the material side of its work. The finances, records, 
etc., are handled by a secretary and treasurer. 
The line of demarcation between the schools for the two races is 
drawn, more sharply by the provision of a visitor for the colored 
schools of each subdistrict. Colored voters only may vote for this 
officer, and his duties in relation to the schools for negroes are iden- 
tical with those of the subdistrict trustee in relation to the schools for 
white children. 
LOUISIANA. 
The most important legislation in Louisiana during the last year 
was, like that in Georgia, related to the state constitution, and its 
importance in emancipating the school authorities from the control 
of general officers and in supplying the former with a uniform and 
reliable income can not be overestimated. The police juries, so called, 
of the several parishes are the officers who had charge of the funds 
and upon whom the local boards of education were obliged to depend. 
After the ratification of one of the two proposed constitutional 
amendments, however, these juries must annually levy a tax of at 
least 3 mills on the dollar and turn over the proceeds to the proper 
parish school boards. If the other amendment is adopted, school 
districts will be upon a plane of equality with municipal corporations, 
drainage districts, and the like in all matters relating to the issuance 
of bonds and the levying of special taxes, within fixed limits, and 
school officers will be entirely independent in their financial affairs.¢ 
Louisiana, too, has altered her system of text-book selection and 
has constituted a state text-book committee to relieve the state 
board of education of the duty of examining books. Contracts now 
cover six years instead of four, and strict uniformity throughout the 
State is required, whereas concessions to local demands were per- 
mitted under the previous law. 
Monthly teachers’ institutes in every parish are required by a new 
law, having been held formerly at the option of the parish super- 
intendent. 
The study of agriculture, which had already found a place in the 
| course prescribed by the state board of education, is now required by 
law in all elementary and secondary schools.   MARYLAND. 
The most significant action of the general assembly of 1910 in 
respect to education was the passage of the new high-schoollaw. Pre- 
viously the establishment of high schools was left largely to the   
@ Both these amendments have been ratified. 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION, 197 
initiative of the districts and the local administration of such dis- 
trict high schools was in the hands of boards of high-school com- 
missioners. Now, however, the county board of school commissioners 
may establish high schools whenever they consider it advisable to do 
so, subject to the approval of the state board of education. All 
schools so established and all public high schools now in operation 
will be under the direct control of the county school commissioners. 
High schools are classified in two groups, those of the first including 
schools with an enrollment of not less than 80 pupils, employing at 
least four regular teachers, of which the principal shall receive a salary 
of $1,200 a year or more and each assistant shall receive $500 a year 
or more; such schools must maintain a four-year course of study, 
with manual-training and domestic-science courses, and also a com- 
mercial or an agricultural course. To be classed in the second group 
a high school must have not less than 35 pupils enrolled and not less 
than two regular teachers, who shall receive salaries of not less than 
$1,000 and $500 for the principal and assistants, respectively; such 
schools must offer a three-year course of instruction, with provision 
for a manual training or an agricultural or a commercial course. 
Special teachers of manual training, etc., may not be included in the 
regular teachers mentioned above. The courses of study are pre- 
scribed by the state board of education, and regular inspection by the 
state superintendent or his assistants is provided. State aid is 
ranted, based on the cost of instruction, the maximum allowed to 
ny school being fixed at $2,500 per annum. Upon the demand of 
he county school commissioners, a separate county tax for high 
chools shall be levied. 
Colored industrial schools—The school commissioners of each county 
re empowered to establish a school for colored youth, in which 
mstruction shall be given daily in domestic science and industrial 
rts. A state subsidy of $1,500 per annum is granted to each of such 
chools, about one-half that amount to be used to employ a colored 
chool supervisor, whose duty it shall be to cause instruction of an 
dustrial character to be given daily in every colored school of the 
ounty. Inspection by the state superintendent or his assistants is     
      
   
      
        
         
   Normal schools —A commission was constituted to investigate and 
ake preparations for a change in the location of the State Normal 
chool, now in Baltimore. The State Colored Normal School has 
een removed from Baltimore to Bowie. 
Teachers’ salaries.—A law enacted in 1904 fixed the minimum salary 
white teachers at $300 per school year. To this was added in 1910 
e provision that a white teacher who holds a second-grade certificate 
d has taught eight years or more, or who holds a first-grade cer- 
ficate and has taught three years shall receive not less than $350 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
   
       198 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910, 
annually; a holder of a first-grade certificate who has taught five years 
shall receive not less than $400, which shall be increased to not less 
than $450 after three additional years of service. 
Libraries —Comprehensive library legislation was also a feature of 
the work of the session of 1910. The Maryland plan of government 
emphasizes the county organization in all things; consequently, the 
new library system differs from that usually seen in library organiza- 
tion in that the control, and as a rule the initiative, is in the hands of 
county rather than local officers. 
Any board of county commissioners may establish a free public 
library and reading room at the county seat, with branches at such 
places throughout the county as may be desirable. They may levy 
an annual tax for the purpose not exceeding 5 cents on each $100 of 
taxable property. 
When requested to do so by the majority of voters in any election 
district, the board of county commissioners shall establish and control 
a public library in the said district, and may levy therefor a tax of 
7 cents on each $100. 
The legislative authority of any municipality may likewise estab- 
lish and maintain a public library and reading room and may levy a 
tax therefor not to exceed 7 cents on each $100. 
Each library established under this act shall be controlled and 
administered by a board of nine directors, appointed by the county 
commissioners or legislative authority by which the said library is 
established. 
The state public library commission may expend not over $100 fo 
books for any library established under the foregoing provisions. 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
The general court of Massachusetts at its session of 1910 enacte 
many laws relating to education, and although none of its acts appe: 
to be of the first importance, several of them are worthy of more tha: 
passing attention. 
The child-labor laws were amended by the following provisions 
First, a penalty is fixed for forging birth certificates for fraudulen| 
use in securing school and employment certificates; second, ever: 
child between 14 and 16 applying for an employment certificate i 
examined by a school physician, and the certificate is refused if th| 
child is not physically able to do the work he or she intends to d 
third, a penalty is provided for permitting a minor to violate tk 
regulations of any town relative to the trade of bootblacking or t 
sale of certain merchandise; fourth, the employment of minors und. 
18 is forbidden in any trade or occupation which the state board 
health determines to be dangerous, extending a prohibition relati: 
to the manufacture of acids only. A ‘‘resolve” was adopted reques
-P-A-G-E-207
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION, 199 
ing the Congress of the United States to enact national and uniform 
laws regulating the employment of children. 
In behalf of the conservation of the public health, an appropriation 
was made for the formation of small traveling ‘‘school tuberculosis 
exhibits” for the purposes of instruction in hygiene and the prevention 
of tuberculosis; the board of health was authorized to prohibit the 
the use of common drinking cups in public places; previous laws 
relating to public playgrounds were amended, more clearly defining 
the purposes of such playgrounds and methods of controlling and 
conducting the same. 
“Thrift”? was added to the list of subjects required to be taught in 
public schools, and the conditions under which pupils may be excused 
from military drill were sc amended as to restrict the granting of such 
excuses. 
The teachers’ pension law relating to the city of Boston was 
amended, removing the former limitation by which the maximum 
pension was fixed at $180 per annum, and stipulating that no pension 
after thirty years’ service shall be less than $312 nor more than $600. 
This money is derived from public taxation, and is not dependent 
upon or connected with the voluntary association of the teachers of 
the city which has as its object the payment of annuities to retired 
teachers. 
In relation to instruction in agriculture, Massachusetts is proceed- 
ing in her characteristic way in preparing for a uniform system of 
schools throughout the Commonwealth, the first step to be taken being 
an investigation by the stato board of education. The report of that 
body, with its recommendations, is directed to be made to the next 
eneral court. A similar report is required upon the desirability of 
stablishing a farm school in the city of Worcester. The appropria- 
ions for the Massachusetts Agricultural College for 1910 include pro- 
ision for winter courses, summer school, correspondence courses, 
onferences on rural progress, and education trains, $15,000 being set: 
ide for such purposes. 
The establishment of Jackson College for Women and the incor- 
oration of the trustees of Massachusetts College are worthy of atten- 
ion. The former institution will occupy a relation to Tufts College 
hich is similar to the relation of Radcliffe College to Harvard Univer- 
ity and of Barnard College to Columbia University. 
Massachusetts College proposes to adopt methods of higher educa- 
ion which are unique. It is not to be a residential institution of the 
rdinary type. It is proposed to utilize the physical equipment and, 
a large extent, the teaching force of local educational institutions, 
articularly public schools and normal schools, thus carrying higher 
ucation with personal instruction at low cost to every considerable 
mmunity in the State. The law permits the institution to grant

degrees, stipulating that a committee of five persons, prominently 
identified with higher education but not connected with Massachu- 
setts College, shall approve the requirements for admission and the 
number and quality of the courses required for degrees, and shall by 
examination or otherwise determine the fitness of all candidates for 
degrees in accordance with current college standards. This committee 
must be approved annually by the state board of education. The 
trustees named in the act are Edmund D. Barbour, George H. Martin,

   MISSISSIPPI. 
The most striking feature of the educational legislation in Missis- 
sippi during the last session is the prominence given to agriculture. 
No less than six bills upon this subject became laws, namely, to 
authorize the establishment of two agricultural high schools in 
each county; to appropriate $30,000 in aid of such schools; to transfer 
the property of agricultural high schools organized under the act 
of 1908, which had been declared unconstitutional, to schools organ- 
ized under the above-mentioned act; to authorize the trustees of 
the Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College to establish 
a permanent branch agricultural experiment station in the eastern| 
part of the State; to authorize the said trustees to establish a simila 
experiment station in the southwest part of the State; to authoriz 
the board of supervisors of any county to establish a county agri 
cultural experiment station. 
The establishment of the Mississippi Normal College was provide 
for, the studies of which shall be confined strictly to those necessar 
for the professional training of teachers. Free tuition is offere 
only to those students who shall agree in writing to teach not les 
than three years in the public schools of the State, two years o 
which shall be in the rural schools of the county in which the studen 
resides. The location of the college is not fixed by law, but th 
trustees are authorized to locate it in the community which offe 
the best inducements. Other laws authorize counties and munici 
palities to issue bonds to enable them to bid for the location of th 
college. 
The plan of centralizing the control of higher institutions whic 
has been adopted in several other States has been put in operatio 
in Mississippi, a law to that effect having been approved April 1 
1910. A single board of seven trustees will in future administer t 
affairs of the University of Mississippi, the Mississippi Agricultur 
and Mechanical College, the Industrial Institute and College, a 
the Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College. One trustee sh:

be a practical farmer, one a practicing lawyer, and one a practical 
builder or architect or factory man. 
Mississippi follows the example of those States which are striving 
to give the advantages of graded schools to children in the more 
sparsely settled districts by authorizing school trustees to provide 
means of transportation to consolidated schools. When two or 
three schools are consolidated an amount equal to the salary of 
one teacher may be expended from the school fund for transporta- 
tion, and when four schools are consolidated the expense for trans- 
portation shall not exceed the salaries of two teachers. 
NEW JERSEY. 
The educational legislation of New Jersey during 1910 was all of 
a supplementary or amendatory character—useful, and in some cases 
even apparently essential, but not of unusual significance in any 
instance. 
Cities may hereafter issue bonds to fund their floating indebted- 
ness incurred for the maintenance of schools, and members of city 
boards of education, when appointed by the mayor, may be chosen 
without regard to their place of *residence. Minor changes were 
made in the laws relating to bonds and special taxes in school 
districts. 
An appropriation of $10,000 annually was made to further the 
study, treatment, and prevention of tuberculosis. The state board 
of health is authorized to use that sum in the publication and dis- 
tribution of literature, the maintenance of a “state tuberculosis 
exhibit,” and the employment of special tuberculosis inspectors. 
Three bills were passed which related to institutions for defective 
persons, one providing that admissions shall be authorized only 
by the commissioner of charities and corrections, another providing 
for the parole of inmates, and the third repealed the last restriction 
as to the age of persons admitted. 
Three new laws have as their purpose the better conduct of the 
financial affairs of religious associations, educational corporations, 
and the like. Under certain conditions they may sell lands or prop- 
erty devised to them for specific purposes and use the proceeds for 
other purposes. 
The juvenile courts and the treatment of dependent and delinquent 
children were also the subjects of legislation, and the transfer of all 
complaints against juvenile defendants to the juvenile courts is now 
required in counties in which a house of detention has been estab- 
lished, whereas the former law provided merely that ‘“it shall be 
lawful” to so transfer such cases. Overnight commitments and 
other detentions of juvenile defendants shall be in the house of  
-P-A-G-E-210
    
202 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910 
detention, when such is available, and not in any police station or 
county jail. Where the number of commitments of delinquent 
children is not sufficient in any county to justify the maintenance 
of a house of detention, the proper officers of that county may con- 
tract with an incorporated institution elsewhere in the State to 
care for its committed delinquents, and may buy land and erect 
buildings near the said institution to accommodate such children. 
Juvenile courts may commit delinquent children to the guardianship 
of the state board of children’s guardians, ordering the parents of 
such children, if the circumstances justify such order, to pay to the 
board an amount sufficient for their maintenance and clothing. 
The factory laws were amended so as to prohibit the employment 
of any minor under 16 more than ten hours a day or fifty-five hours 
a week; between July 4, 1910, and July 4, 1911, no minor under 15 
shall be employed between 6 p. m. and 6 a. m.; after July 4, 1911, 
no minor under 16 shall be so employed. It is understood that this 
law has especial reference to the glass factories of the State in which 
night work has been common. 
NEW YORK. 
The year 1910 has been distinguished in New York for the number 
of important measures adopted. The education law was revised, 
and while none of the changes made were extensive a great many 
important differences appear, especially in relation to the powers 
of the commissioner of education, all of them tending to increase 
the dignity and power of that officer. He is no longer required to 
act as secretary to the board of regents, a position which implies a 
certain degree of subordination; on the contrary, he is empowered 
equally with the chancellor of the university to call at any time a 
special meeting of the regents and to fix the time and place therefor; 
his supervision is extended over colleges, technical, and professional 
schools, as well as over all other institutions of the university; his 
authority over the school systems of cities is emphasized; he is 
authorized in his discretion to suspend the laws relating to the 
qualifications of teachers and to authorize the employment and 
payment of teachers who do not possess the prescribed qualifica- 
tions; he is directed to prescribe the courses of study of state normal 
schools; the education of Indians is placed more directly under his 
control; of his own motion he may institute proceedings, render 
decisions, and make and enforce orders in relation to any official] 
act of any school officer, authority, or meeting, such proceedings| 
to be final and conclusive and not subject to question or review in| 
any place or court whatever. 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION, 203 
These powers were all conferred in the revision of 1910, and are 
additional to the large powers which he already possessed. 
Board of regents.—The authority of the regents was also strength- 
ened by the same act, and they were specifically given legislative 
powers concerning the educational system of the State. This 
appears to be, however, largely a difference of form, for they were 
previously permitted to make rules and regulations and to enforce 
them, and it is not likely that their ‘“‘enactments’’ will differ greatly 
from their “rules” except in phraseology. A provision in the new 
law forbidding the incorporation of educational and like institutions 
under any general law other than that governing the regents is an 
important one, inasmuch as it closes a breach in the wall through 
which unworthy or ill-equipped institutions or corporations might 
have entered the educational field. 
Agriculture—In relation to instruction in agriculture effective 
provision is made in the new code. Cities and union free schools 
may establish high schools of agriculture, mechanic arts, and home 
making, and the State will aid such institutions by contributing $500 
per annum for the first teacher, and $200 per annum for each addi- 
tional teacher. The State itself had already established three well- 
equipped secondary schools of this character, and the revised law 
authorizes them to offer courses for teachers in agriculture, mechanic 
arts, and home making, and to issue to graduates of such courses 
licenses to teach those subjects in the common schools of the State. 
District superintendent.—The new code became a law April 22, 
1910, but its enactment did not by any means put an end to edu- 
cational legislation during the session, which extended for several 
weeks after that date. 
By far the most important of the later acts was that which abol- 
ished the office of school commissioner throughout the State and 
created instead the office of district superintendent of schools. By 
the terms of this act the territory of the State outside of cities and 
villages of more than 5,000 inhabitants which employ superintend- 
lents is to be divided into 207 supervisory districts, from one to eight 
being assigned to each county. The division between the counties 
ppears to be arbitrary but with some reference to population and 
rea. The method of selecting the superintendent of each of these 
istricts is unique: Two school ‘‘directors’”’ are chosen at a general > 
lection for each town and the directors of the several towns com- 
osing a supervisory district elect the superintendent for that dis- 
rict. The directors perform no other function in connection with 
he schools, and since their term of office is five years and that of 
he superintendent is the same, it follows that. except in the event

   of a vacancy, each director is called upon to act officially but once 
during his incumbency of the office. This arrangement is designed 
to remove the selection of district superintendents as far as possible 
from political control, and is supposed to be analogous to the plan 
in operation in cities in which boards of education elect the super- 
intendents. The essential difference is, however, that the city 
boards bear practically the entire responsibility for the schools, are 
presumably in constant touch with their operations, and may be 
supposed to know from personal experience the requirements of 
the position which they are called upon to fill; on the other hand, 
the “directors” provided by this law form to all intents a body 
foreign to the school system and without responsibility in it except 
to cast a vote once in five years. The qualifications demanded of 
a district superintendent are such, however, that it would not be 
possible to go far wrong with any method of selection, for he must 
possess or be entitled to receive a certificate authorizing him to 
teach in any of the public schools of the State and must pass an exam- 
ination prescribed by the commissioner of education on the super- 
vision of courses of study in agriculture and teaching the same. 
The State will pay to each district superintendent a salary of 
$1,200 per annum, with an allowance of $300 a year for official ex- 
penses. Towns composing a supervisory district may increase the 
salary of the superintendent by taxation. 
The powers of the superintendents are somewhat greater than 
were those of the school commissioners, and the restrictions relating 
to extraneous business and the provisions for rigid supervision by 
the commissioner of education are such that nothing seems to have 
been omitted that can be placed in a law to insure earnest and effect- 
ive service. 
This law marks a notable advance in rural school supervision, and 
is expected to add largely to the efficiency of New York’s machinery 
for educational administration. 
With this increased number of superintendents, New York becomes 
one of the foremost States in the Union as regards general provision 
for the supervision of schools.¢ 
a The majority of the States have county superintendents. West Virginia has 29 superintendents of| 
magisterial districts in addition to the county superintendents. Ohio has legal provision for district or| 
township superintendents, but only 114 out of 1,327 townships employed such officers in 1909. The sys- 
tem of supervision in the other New England States is similar to that of Massachusetts inasmuch as each| 
superintendent acts for a single town (or township) or for a union of two or more towns. Professional] 
supervision is required by state law in Rhode Island, Maine, and Vermont as in Massachusetts, but it] 
has not yet been possible for all towns of Vermont or of Maine to comply with the law; 40 per cent of the 
enrollment in Maine is in schools not under expert supervision. All the New England States contribu’ 
to the salaries of superintendents. Nevada has abolished the office of county superintendent (of whic! 
there were 15) and 5 deputy state superintendents have been constituted in their stead; their salari 
($2,000 each) and traveling expenses are paid by the State. Virginia has also abolished the county super. 
intendency and now has “division superintendents” paid in part by the State and in part by the sever: 
localities; the “divisions” embrace usually a county, never less, but sometimes more than one; super- 
intendents of cities also are “division superintendents.”

«The number of superintendents in New York is composed thus: District superintendents, 207; city superintendents, 48; superintendents in villages having more than 5,000 inhabitants, 37; assistant super- 
intendents, 39; total, 331. 
Retirement of teachers.—A number of laws were enacted establish- 
ng retirement funds in certain localities, which funds are to be 
erived in part from deductions from teachers’ salaries and in part 
om appropriations of public funds; and an amendment was made 
o the education law providing for the retirement of teachers in 
tate institutions. It provides: 
Every person who, for a period of ten years immediately preceding, has been em- 
loyed by the State as a teacher in any college, school, or institution maintained and 
pported by the State and who shall have been engaged in teaching in some college, 
miversity, school, academy, or institution, or in the public schools of this State or 
isewhere during a period aggregating thirty years, and has reached the age of seventy 
ears must, at his request, or may on the order of the commissioner of education, be 
tired from such employment. * * * Every person who shall be retired under 
e provisions of this article shall be entitled to receive from the State one-half the 
lary which such person was receiving at the date of such retirement, not to exceed, 
wever, in the case of a supervising official or principal, one thousand dollars, and 
the case of a teacher, seven hundred and fifty dollars. In no case shall the pay- 
ent to any person retired hereunder be less than the sum of three hundred dollars. 
This law was intended primarily for the benefit of teachers in the 
ate normal schools, but was drafted so as to include teachers in 
1 state institutions. Indeed, it might be easily possible to con- 
rue it to cover public school teachers as well, and but very slight 
anges would be required to place New York with Maryland and 
Ihode Island among the States which pension teachers wholly at 
ate expense. 
Date of school-district meetings—A measure of considerable value 
administration was that which changed the date of the annual 
leeting of each school district from the first Tuesday in August to 
e first Tuesday in May. Districts may now vote appropriations 
repairs and improvements in time for the work to be done during 
le summer vacation, a decidedly more advantageous arrangement 
an the former one.

   General Code, for only a single minor bill other than appropriation] 
bills had passed before that time. 
The labors of the codifying commission had been continuous fo 
over three years, and were completed with the adoption of thei 
report and the enactment of the new code on February 15, 1910 
This code in itself did not, presumably, contain new legislation, an 
like other similar revisions was simply a more orderly arrangement o 
the laws in force. But its adoption was followed immediately b 
extensive amendments to the substance of the laws; not less than 63: 
sections were amended or repealed within three months. The legisla 
tors were plainly in a mental state which was favorable to changes, an 
it was but natural that those interested in school legislation shoul« 
be able-to secure the passage of measures that had been sought i 
vain for years, and to bring about a long series of desirable amend 
ments for the improvement of the system. 
New normal schools.—Just as the session was about to close, a bi 
was passed creating two additional normal schools, one in nort! 
eastern Ohio and one in northwestern Ohio. A commission wal 
constituted to select locations for the schools and to secure option| 
for the purchase of land if necessary. This commission will co 
plete its duties by making a report to the governor. As soon as th 
general assembly makes appropriation for the purchase of suc 
sites and the erection of the necessary buildings the governor wi 
appoint a board of five trustees for each school. The trustees i 
turn will select the presidents, and the work of building and orga 
ization will proceed. In planning the buildings, ample provisio} 
must be made for a well-equipped department for the preparatio 
of teachers in the subject of agriculture. 
Compulsory education.—The sections of the new code relating 
school attendance and employment certificates were amended a: 
greatly strengthened, and certain features were introduced whi 
will undoubtedly commend themselves to framers of similar laws i 
other States. 
The time of required attendance of children between 8 and 
years of age was increased from 24 to 28 weeks, and the simp 
requirement that children between 14 and 16 years of age should 
able to read and write the English language in order to secure e 
ployment certificates was so amended that such certificates m 
now be issued only to children who have passed a satisfactory fift! 
grade test in reading, spelling, writing, English, grammar, geograph 
and arithmetic. Children residing in other States who desire 
work in Ohio must undergo the same tests. Employment certi| 
cates, or permits, are not to be made general, but in each case wi 
reference to a particular employer, who must first agree in writii 
to employ the child legally, and to return the certificate to the pro
-P-A-G-E-215
  EDUCATIONAL LEGISLATION, 207 
officer when the child leaves his employment, stating the reasons 
therefor. If application is made for an employment certificate for 
child who is undeveloped, or who appears to be not in sound health, 
uch certificate may not be issued without a certificate from the 
oard of health showing that the child is able to do the intended 
ork. 
All children between 14 and 16 years of age who are not legally 
mployed are required to attend school the full time; and such 
hildren who have not completed the eighth elementary grade may 
e required to continue their schooling in part-time schools until 
hey are 16 years of age. 
Hereafter truant officers will, in effect, act as employment agents 
lor children, for they are required to keep a list of children between 
4 and 16 years of age who desire employment and are entitled to 
ertificates, and employers desiring help shall have free access to 
uch lists. Truant officers shall cooperate with the department of 
orkshops and factories in enforcing the child-labor laws. 
When a child in school has reached his twelfth year and has not 
lompleted the fourth-grade work, principals and teachers may cause 
ch child to devote his entire time to the studies required: for an 
ployment certificate, with such manual training as may be prac- 
cable. 
Business affairs of boards of education.—A number of. provisions 
ere added to the laws governing school boards which will tend to 
ore conservative business management. No obligation for the 
yment of money may be incurred unless the secretary of the board 
the auditor, as the case may be, shall certify that money is avail- 
le in the proper fund to meet the expense. The manner of making 
yments from school funds and the proceedings of boards of educa- 
mn in relation to the same, have been more clearly prescribed; 
nds of city school districts have been better safeguarded, and 
posits of school funds in banks have been better regulated. 
Civil service rules for school employees.—A radical change has been 
lade in the manner of selecting employees of boards of education of 
ies, and now, with the exception of teachers, a few officers specific- 
ly enumerated, and unskilled laborers temporarily employed, all 
pointments are made after competitive public examination, con- 
cted by the local civil service commissioners. Janitors, engineers, 
ant officers (excepting the chief), clerks, and the like are all 
luded in the classified service, and the ‘‘merit system” is extended 
cover them. 
Teachers’ certificates and pensions.—Important changes are made 
the certification of teachers, especially in relation to graduates of 
roved normal schools and higher institutions. The requirements 
professional certificates were also amended. The pension law

208 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
was changed in three important particulars, all in favor of the teacher, 
namely, reducing the time which an applicant for a pension must have 
taught in the district in which he applies for a pension, increasing 
the rate of the pension from $10 to $12.50 per annum for each year of 
service, and increasing the maximum from $300 to $450 a year. 
Consolidation of schools and transportation of pupils.—The questio 
of centralization may be submitted to the voters either at a general 
election or at a special election called for the purpose. The questio 
of providing transportation in special districts and in village district: 
is left wholly to the discretion of the respective boards of education. 
In no event shall any board of education be required to furnish trans 
portation to children living within a mile of the schoolhouse, but nm 
discrimination shall be made between different portions of a distric’ 
or between pupils under similar conditions. 
High schools.—The Boxwell-Patterson laws have been amended ti 
require boards of education which maintain third grade high school; 
(with two-year courses) to pay the tuition of graduates of such school 
in other high schools for two additional years; and boards maintain 
ing second grade high schools (with three-year courses) shall pay th 
tuition of their graduates in other high schools for one additional yea: 
Pupils living more than 4 miles from the high school which they ar 
entitled to attend may attend a nearer high school if such there b 
the board of education paying for their tuition or else providin 
transportation to their own school. 
The evident effect of this law will be to cause many of the secon| 
and third grade high schools to develop into schools of the first grad 
offering standard four-year courses, for it is plain that boards wij 
frequently, if not usually, find it to their advantage to retain the 
pupils in their own schools rather than to pay tuition elsewhere. 
There is a saving clause in the new law which relieves boards 
education of the payment of tuition as provided, when a local t 
levy of 12 mills does not produce any more money than is necessa: 
for the support of the schools. 
Libraries.—Township districts, as well as city, village, and speci 
districts may now levy taxes for the support of public libraries. T 
powers of public library boards in relation to the purchase, coi 
demnation, and sale of lands is increased, and the limit of taxati 
is raised from 1 to 1} mills. 
Agriculture.—In authorizing the establishment of agricultu 
experiment stations by the counties, in favoring the extension work 
the Ohio State University, and in providing for training of teach 
of agriculture and domestic science in the two new normal schoo 
the legislature of 1910 aligned Ohio with other progressive States t! 
are taking effective steps in forwarding education in agriculture. ©

   Increased appropriations.—The amount appropriated for schools 
was increased from $2,330,000 to $2,470,000, to be distributed at the 
rate of $2 (instead of $1.85, as in 1909) per capita of school population, 
The appropriation in aid of weak districts was $50,000, an increase of 
$5,000 over the previous year. 
Welfare of children.—Boys under 18 years of age may not be 
employed in messenger service between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. Children 
of persons confined in a workhouse must be maintained by the county 
from which the parent was sentenced. The penalty of kidnaping a 
child under 12 years of age for the purpose of extortion was increased 
to life imprisonment. A committee was appointed to investigate the 
conditions at the Girls’ Industrial Home with a view to the better 
classification of the inmates and the separation of the more vicious 
and depraved from the younger and more innocent girls. 
PORTO RICO. 
The legislative assembly of Porto Rico enacted but few laws relating 
to education, and those were of scarcely more than local importance. 
The appropriation of $20,000 for the development of the University of 
Porto Rico and the provision for fifteen days’ leave of absence with 
pay for teachers in cases of necessity are worthy of mention. 
RHODE ISLAND. 
Of one hundred and fourteen new laws passed at the January 
session of 1910, only nine are of interest to students of education, and 
only three in addition to the general appropriation bill relate directly 
to schools, namely, (1) authorizing the commissioner of public schools 
to appoint an assistant commissioner; (2) appropriating $100 annu- 
ally to each graded school for every ungraded school which has been 
consolidated with it, the said amount to be used for the support of the 
chool or for the transportation of pupils to it; and (3) appropriating 
0 the state normal school all moneys received by the said school 
or tuition. 
The ‘‘factory inspection” law was amended by omitting a clause 
hich allowed mercantile establishments to employ children under 
6 after 8 p. m. on Saturdays and on the four days preceding Christ- 
as. The ‘‘age and employment certificate” prescribed now con- 
ains a clause to the effect that the child named is able to read at sight 
nd write legibly sentences in the English language. The authority 
f factory inspectors is enlarged and their number is increased by two. 
The abandonment, neglect, or maltreatment of any child under 17 
s made a misdemeanor, punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both. 
he guilty person shall forfeit any right he may have had to the 
ustody of such child.

SOUTH CAROLINA. 
   
        
   
                  
   
         
        
       
           A revision of the school law of the State is contemplated in the joint 
resolution providing a commission for the purpose, consisting of the 
state superintendent of education, the inspector of high schools, the 
president of one of the state institutions for higher education, one 
person familiar with common school systems, and one person learned 
in the law. The governor will name the members not specifically 
designated by their titles. 
The policy inaugurated in the previous year of making a direct 
appropriation in aid of weak districts to enable them to extend their 
school terms proved to be successful as a stimulus to school develop- 
ment, and the legislature of 1910 increased the amount appropriated 
for the purpose from $20,000 to $60,000 annually. The motive for 
such legislation may be found in the fact that in 1909 the average 
duration of the schools for white children in country districts was 
only 23.36 weeks, and for colored children only 13.5 weeks. The law 
provides that not over $100 shall be allotted to any one school in a 
year, and no school maintained more than one hundred days from 
regular funds, and no school district which does not levy a special tax 
of at least 2 mills shall receive aid from this fund. 
Another special appropriation of importance was that of $20,000 to 
aid in the construction of school buildings. Of this, the state board 
of education is authorized to contribute $50 to every $100 raised for 
the same purpose locally, but no school may receive more than $300. 
In case of consolidation of two or more schools, $50 additional may be 
granted, and in the division of the fund consolidated schools shall be} 
given preference. 
The favor in which the idea of consolidation is held is shown not 
only in the above provision, but also in the clause in the act relatin, 
to county aid for new buildings, in which a similar bonus of $50 i 
given to consolidated schools. 
The 3-mill state tax regularly levied in obedience to section 6 
Article II, of the constitution supplies the greater part of the schoo! 
revenue of the State, and though special district taxes are authorized 
only about one-third of the 1,833 districts of the State levied suc! 
taxes in 1909. Four mills was previously the maximum allowed fo: 
this tax, and the proceeds were often insufficient. This limit wa 
raised, therefore, to 8 mills by the legislature of 1910. 
VIRGINIA. 
Agricultural high schools.—Virginia in common with other Southe: 
States is moving earnestly in the matter of agricultural education. Ti 
1908 a clause was placed in the general appropriation bill setting asid 
a sum not to exceed $20,000 for the establishment of departments of

   agriculture, domestic economy, and manual training in at least one 
high school in each congressional district of the State. The legisla- 
ture of 1910 pursued the subject still further and passed an act appro- 
priating $30,000 a year for such high schools, with an additional sum 
of $25,000 to be used for providing buildings and equipment. 
The terms of this law in relation to studies, methods, and equipment 
are of interest. Not less than 5 acres of land shall be provided for each 
school for purposes of demonstration in agricultural science, and as 
far as practicable the cultivation of the land shall be done by the 
students themselves. Suitable buildings shall be provided and 
equipped as workshops for manual training and such forms of shop 
work as are applicable to rural life. Female students shall be in- 
structed in the domestic arts and sciences, and may take also the 
agricultural course if they so desire. The usual academic instruction 
shall be given, but at least one-fourth the school time of students shall 
be devoted to agriculture, domestic arts and sciences, and manual 
training. 
The agricultural high schools established under this act may be 
used as centers for directing the demonstration farm work and other 
extension work throughout the several congressional districts, and the 
sum of $10,000 was appropriated in furtherance of such work. 
Coordination of extension work in agriculture-—On the next day after 
the passage of the above law, another act was adopted with the pur- 
pose of systematizing and coordinating all the educational work of the 
State in relation to agriculture outside the established institutions. 
A united agricultural board was constituted, consisting of 11 mem- 
bers, namely, the governor, the state superintendent of public in- 
struction, the commissioner of agriculture, 6 members representing 
the several agricultural boards, institutions, and experiment stations 
lof the State, and 2 officers of the United States Department of 
Agriculture. 
The following assignment of work is prescribed, with the stipulation 
that the board may, in its discretion, adopt other methods and agen- 
ies and may reassign any of the work described: To the Virginia Col- 
lege of Agriculture and Polytechnic Institute, adult demonstration 
ork, movable schools and like agencies, $5,000 annually being appro- 
riated for such work; to the Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station, 
he establishment and direction of local or district experiment stations, 
or which $5,000 annually is appropriated ; to the state board of educa- 
ion, experimental and demonstration work in public schools, and for 
his purpose the said board of education is directed to set apart $5,000 
mnually from school funds; to the commissioner and state board of 
griculture, the direction and management of farmers’ institutes, for 
hich $5,000 is annually appropriated. In addition to these pro- 
isions the board of supervisors of the several counties are authorized  
-P-A-G-E-220
  212 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
to appropriate from county funds, for experimental and demonstra- 
tion work, not over $20 for each 1,000 inhabitants. 
Retirement of school teachers.—A bill to provide a general retire- 
ment fund for the public-school teachers of the State became a law 
March 14, 1908. It proved to be defective, principally in regard to 
its method of collecting and bringing into the state treasury the 
amounts deducted from teachers’ salaries. A new bill was accord- 
ingly drafted and passed March 14, 1910, and contains as its novel 
feature a provision directing the state board of education to deduct 
for the retirement fund from the annual apportionment of state 
moneys to each county, city, and town, an amount equal to 1 per cent 
of the total amount of teachers’ salaries of the said county, city, or town 
during the previous year. Differences between the amounts actually 
so deducted and the amounts that would have been deducted if the 
salaries of the proper year had been the basis, shall be adjusted at the 
next apportionment. The pension paid will be equal to one-half the 
average salary of the pensioner during his last five years of service, the 
maximum being $500 for those whose salaries had been over $1,000, 
and $400 for those who had received less than $1,000. From the first 
year’s pension there shall be deducted, for the permanent endowment 
of the pension fund, an amount equal to 30 per cent of the pensioner’s 
average annual salary for the last five years, less the amounts he has 
contributed to the pension fund. Any teacher who is incapacitated 
after twenty years’ service, and any teacher who desires to retire after 
having served thirty years and has reached the age of 50 if a woman, 
or 58 if a man, shall be retired. .The State contributes $5,000 annually 
to the fund. 
Welfare of children.—Solicitude for the welfare of children has 
marked the legislation of well-nigh all the States in the last few years, 
and Virginia is no exception to the rule. Her contribution during 
1910 to the aggregate of law upon the subject consists of the following: 
1. An act making it a misdemeanor for parents or guardians to 
neglect or refuse to support their children under 14 years of age, or to 
subject children under 17 to vicious or immoral influences, to encour- 
age any child to commit a misdemeanor, or for any person to send a 
child under 17 to any house of prostitution or to any saloon, gambling 
place, pool room, or bucket shop, knowing them to be such. The 
last-named provision affects particularly the messenger and _tele- 
graph companies. 
2. An act providing that vicious or neglected children in the cus- 
tody of institutions may not be ‘‘placed out” as apprentices in viola- 
tion of any law against child labor. 
3. An act providing for the detention or confinement of minors| 
under 17 years of age for certain offenses. Such a minor charged fo: 
the first time with any felony except rape, or with any petty crime o:

     misdemeanor, or any child under 17 who is vicious, persistently truant, 
incorrigible, destitute, or neglected, may be committed to the care 
and custody of any suitable society or institution during the period 
of his or her minority. Such juvenile offenders shall not be deemed 
criminals or treated as such. Except in aggravated cases no such 
child shall be committed to a jail, workhouse, police station, or peni- 
tentiary. Children committed under this act may be released by the 
court under the care of a probation officer. All hearings or trials of 
children described in this act shall be in private. 
Public playgrounds.—Any city or town of more than 10,000 inhabit- 
ants may provide and maintain at least one public playground for. 
each race, and at least one additional palyground for each race for 
every additional 20,000 of its population. 
The acceptance of this act, the amounts to be appropriated, and the 
like shall depend upon the action of the common council of each city, 
and if playgrounds are established they shall be under the control of 
a board of playground commissioners to be appointed by the mayor. 
Money may be raised by special taxation or by the sale of bonds for 
the purchase, equipment, and maintenance of such playgrounds. 
Consolidation of schools —Few States have failed to favor by legis- 
lative action the consolidation of small rural schools, and the advan- 
tages of such consolidation are universally admitted. In the general 
appropriation bill approved May 16, 1910, the Virginia legislature 
permits the state board of education to use $25,000 for the encourage- 
ment and maintenance of rural graded schools of two, three, and four 
rooms, the amount allotted to any one school to be limited to $200. 
Educational commission.—The commission constituted in 1908 to 
devise a stable method for the maintenance, management, and expan- 
sion of educational institutions was continued, and was directed to 
report its recommendations to the general assembly at its next 
session.

INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES.

INTRODUCTION. 
The main purpose of the present chapter is to present a fairly com- 
lete view of the existing provision of schools which may be said to 
ertain, in a measure at least, to that form of training now widely 
iscussed under the title ‘vocational education.” The distinction 
etween liberal and vocational education and their points of ap- 
roach are indicated in the following citation from a recent discus- 
ion? of the subject by Commissioner Snedden. Doctor Snedden says: 
Liberal and vocational education are not identical, and have only certain elements 
common; they aim in essentially different directions, and their valid aims can 
realized only by making allowance for this difference. On the other hand, some 
the studies which contribute to liberal education may be so handled as to give a 
‘is, or approach, or means of choice to subsequent vocational education. For 
y persons, a vital vocational education, resting on concrete foundations and mak- 
due allowance for expansion into the related fields of science, art, history, eco- 
mics, and civics, may become an exceedingly effective means of liberalizing the 
inds of several types of boys and girls, and especially those least capable of abstract 
inking or social idealism. 
In the work cited above Doctor Snedden notices the great con- 
sion of terminology, and also in pedagogic opinions, which precludes 
satisfactory classification of the schools offering vocational training, 
difficulty that has been fully recognized in the classification 
tempted in this chapter. With respect to the conditions that make 
e subject one of importance at the present time, Doctor Snedden 
Lys: 
‘he demand for vocational education under school conditions is a widespread one, 
is rooted in the social and economic changes of the age. Rightly organized, 
ational education will prove a profitable investment for society. The pedagogy

of this education will differ widely from that evolved for liberal education, and 
especially in respect to making practice, or participation in productive work, a 
fundamental element. Vocational education must be so conducted as to contribute 
to the making of the citizen, as well as the worker. In the course of the develop- 
ment of a progressive social economy we may expect it to be made obligatory upon| 
every individual to acquire a certain amount of vocational education, just as the| 
present tendency of legislation is to prevent any one from remaining illiterate. Voca. 
tional education is not in conflict with liberal education, but is a supplemental form, 
and may be expected to reinforce it.    
  
  
    
    
      
      
    
       
    
    
      
    
     
      
   
            
     GENERAL REVIEW. 
The establishment of the Manual Training School of Washingto: 
University, St. Louis, in 1880, gave great momentum to the move 
ment for manual training in this country, which has been steadil; 
gaining ground ever since that event. In 1909 more than half th 
cities of the United States of 4,000 population and upward reporte 
manual training in their schools. Such training first found a plac 
in the curricula of the high schools, but soon began to push its wa‘ 
down into the elementary grades. But this earlier training was no 
vocational in aim; it was rather regarded as a part of an academi 
education. It was cultural. In recent years the emphasis has bee: 
changing from the academic and cultural to the vocational ai 
So marked has been this change that industrial education, vocation 
training, and even trade training have become almost synonymou 
terms in current discussions. This new emphasis, which differe 
tiates the ordinary manual training from vocational training for th| 
trades and semitechnical pursuits, has its roots in the recognize 
need of improved industrial efficiency in American industries. 
The widespread interest in the subject is indicated by the fact th 
it commands the support of all the great national organizations pe 
taining to education or vitally interested in its effects,* as well as 
numerous local clubs and societies in different sections of the countr 
The consensus of opinion on the part of the larger associatio:

    mitted a report prepared by a member of the committee, Mr. Milton 
P. Higgins, which report was duly adopted. After reviewing the 
recent marked progress in industrial education, which it was affirmed 
had been greatly promoted by the National Association of Manu- 
facturers, the report, having in mind certain objections that have 
been raised to what was understood to be the position of the asso- 
ciation on this subject, proceeded to define more fully than heretofore 
the attitude of the committee on the general subject, as follows: 
Your committee believes that some of the objections to industrial education, so 
called, have been reasonable and that if industrial and trade education is put upon a 
proper and sound and high basis all intelligent thought, including that of rightly 
organized labor, will approve, simply because such industrial education will advance 
every interest involved in the life of the workingman and even in a better life of the 
organization itself. * * * We educators and all who advocate a new education 
for the good of the skilled workman * * * intend to take boys at 14 years of age 
and give them four years of training corresponding to the high school period—half 
skilled work and half suitable schooling. 
We propose to take any boy who wants to be a superior skilled workman and give 
him this thorough training in skill and schooling. 
We propose to make the boy a skilled workman, superior to his father in efficiency 
and shop experience, and we propose also to give him, during the time he is learning 
la trade, more and better schooling than his father was able to get and consequently 
ithe boy can go directly from the trade school to a good wage-earning position of any 
op simply upon his own merit. 
With respect to trade schools the committee continued: 
A trade school can not be too practical. The more practical, productive, and com- 
ercial, the more possible is mechanical efficiency as well as mental discipline and 
eneral culture. 
The time has arrived when all discussion regarding the importance of industrial 
ucation should give place to the establishment of schools and other methods of 
curing such industrial training. The question is not, Shall we have industrial 
ducation in America? but, What kind shall it be? There has come to be general 
teement now that industrial education for the mechanic means trade education. 
First. What kind of trade schools should we establish to the end that we may meet 
e more and more exacting demands for higher mechanical skill and industrial 
ental discipline? And shall the trade school be productive or consist of worthless 
xercises on material to be thrown away when completed? * * * 
But this is not our only problem in trade education. Some of the others are as 
lows: 
Second. What shall we do to vitalize and enrich the training of apprentices in 
ops of all kinds as they now exist throughout the country? 
Third. Besides the half-time regular course for pupils, already considered above, 
hat supplementary training shall the trade school provide for those apprentices 
ind workmen who are already in the shops and factories? 
(a) Evening schools may be established, both for schooling in all common branches 
d for special skill and shop practice in various branches of mechanical trades. 
(b) Half-day schooling each week may be previded for apprentices and men from 
various shops where the proprietor is willing to allow wages to continue while 
e apprentice devotes the half day per week in school.

         (c) Part-time schools may be provided where a double set of apprentices is em- 
ployed, making a half-time system; or a one-third-time system where three sets of 
apprentices are employed, so that each apprentice have one-half or one-third of his 
time devoted to schooling. : 
In all these extension schools, whether one-half day per week or part-time plan 
with two or more sets of apprentices, the wages earned would admit of supplying 
industrial education to many who could not afford to take the regular trade-school 
course without earning wages meanwhile. All who are able to take the full course 
would, however, command higher wages at the end of the course. 
In regard to the double aim which somewhat complicates the 
general problem as related to the industrial education of girls, the 
report says: 
The aim in the industrial education of girls must be a double aim, viz, preparation| 
for the girl’s occupation for immediate self-support and her preparation for home life] 
in all its departments. 
These two aims must be kept in proper balance. Any system of industrial educa: 
tion for girls will be inadequate that does not provide for both aims. 
After an extended presentation of both aims, the opinion of th 
committee was summarized as follows: 
Your committee therefore conceives that the desirable consideration in regard 
girls is the promotion of independent industrial schools as planned that the duple 
needs may be secured, and that special effort should be made to advance the scienc 
and the skill in cooking and housekeeping. 
First. By the establishment of day industrial schools for girls whose main need i 
to prepare for industrial wage-earning pursuits. During this preparation, for a trade| 
however, considerable domestic training is a necessary part of the course. 
Second. Courses for girls who wish to take as a vocation complete and thoroug] 
training in any or all branches of domestic science, housekeeping, and management, 
the home in all its branches. 
Third. And possibly part-time schools for girls who are already engaged in wag 
earning pursuits in the less skilled occupations. 
Fourth. Evening classes for women who are employed in the trades who wish t 
advance themselves; and also for trade workers who wish to prepare for teaching i 
industrial schools. 
Fifth. Evening classes for women and girls who wish to become better housekeepe! 
All the departments above mentioned can be organized naturally along the sai 
lines as the boys’ school, i. e., about the same relation of skilled work and of schoolin; 
and therefore about the same sort of rooms for each, except the department for “‘co: 
plete home training.’’ This department should be independent of all other vocation: 
departments, and be very complete, thorough, and hence attractive. The number 
pupils in this department might be smaller than the other trade classes—say not ov 
thirty pupils for the first class—because this is to demonstrate the most impor 
and most promising field in industrial education. 
A supplemental report on the cooperative system of industrial ed 
cation was presented by a member of the committee, Mr. De Bru 
who dealt with the progress of the cooperative course as “ planned 
Prof. Herman Schneider, déan of the engineering college of t 
University of Cincinnati,’ and with the plans for the establishme 
of a college of commerce on the cooperative plan. The latest devi

                                    opment of the cooperative principle, as carried out in Cincinnati, is 
illustrated by what the report called “the continuation school.” 
Experiments in this direction were begun by two manufacturing 
companies which started an apprentice school under the direction of a 
young man who had himself been a machinist, Mr. J. H. Renshaw. 
In view of the success of the school, “a committee of the Cincinnati 
Metal Trades Association called upon the school board and asked 
that a continuation school be started to which all the machine-shop 
apprentices could be sent. The plan was laid out by Mr. Renshaw 
and the school was turned over to the school board.” It is proposed, 
according to the report, to establish a girls’ continuation school during 
the present year. 
It was moved and carried that both the report of the committee 
and the supplemental report should take the usual course.

The drift of opinion discernible in the various papers presented at the 
third annual meeting of the National Society for the Promotion of 
Industrial Education (Milwaukee, December 2-4, 1909) was empha- 
sized in the closing address of Dr. L. D. Harvey, superintendent of 
schools, Menomonie, Wis., who had been asked to close the discussion. 
Doctor Harvey said in part: 
I have only two or three points which I want to bring to your attention. One is 
that the discussions during this meeting have indicated that the trade school, as we 
have been considering it, is not the intermediate industrial school; secondly, that 
the trade school as it exists to-day—not the intermediate industrial school—has not 
yet given evidence of its adequateness to meet the need of the day in the way of 
industrial education. For instance, the splendidly equipped trade school in this 
city, with its magnificent work—and I believe no better is to be found anywhere in 
the country—in a city of 350,000, has only 66 pupils in attendance for the full time 
during the day, and about the same number for part time in evening classes, at an 
annual per capita cost of $300 to $350 for instructional purposes. We must not forget 
that the trade school here is new, but the remarkable thing is that the boys in the city 
of Milwaukee are not flocking to it in large numbers. I believe the same condition 
obtains in many other trade schools. That is what I meant when I said that the 
trade school as it exists to-day, in its most fully developed form, superb in its equip- 
ment, splendid in its teaching force, magnificent in its output, is not meeting the 
great need in industrial education. I want to call your attention to the fact that the 
trade school which does not take these pupils until the age of 16 is not at all filling the 
great gap that exists in our educational system. There is need that something be done 
for the boys from 14 to 16 years of age who have dropped out of school. I think the 
reason for so small an attendance upon the trade school here thus far is that so many 
lof these boys have dropped out of school two or three years before the trade school will 
ake them, and it does not draw them back again. I take it that this discussion of the 
uestion of intermediate industrial schools was provided for in this programme for the 
urpose of trying to find out what is being done and what it is possible to do to keep 
old of these boys and to keep them in school longer.

228 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
   
            
   
                                 
   
           
   
                
    * * * JT want to call your attention to the fact that if we are going to have even 
the beginnings of industrial education, we must reach those that the trade school never 
reaches, and in other ways than the trade school attempts to reach them. In the 
beginning it will not be the aim to make finished workmen, but it will be the aim to 
direct the mental activities of the pupils; to interest them in things industrial; to 
teach them to think in terms of things and terms of processes of construction, and in 
the interpretation of plans and drawings, and thus make them better fitted to take up 
the work of a specific trade and advance to industrial efficiency than they would be 
but for this. 
* * * JT take it that it is not simply a question in your proposed intermediate 
industrial school of getting the defectives, getting the delinquents, getting the fel- 
lows who already exhibit signs of moral deterioration; it is worth while to get the 
fellows that have some good stuff in them, it is worth while to get them to see what 
there is in the field of industrial effort, and it is worth while, therefore, to put into our 
public school system as it exists to-day those things in the way of intermediate work— 
beginning work, if you please—toward industrial efficiency as a part of the public 
schoolsystem. I believe when we do that we shall find that there will not be so large 
an exodus of these boysand girls before the completion of the elementary school course 
nor at the end of the course as we now have. * * * Iam not one of those people 
who, when discussing industrial education, shy at the word manual training, because 
I have been fortunate enough to see some manual training schools that do many of 
these things I have here advocated. I know it is possible to so organize a course of 
manual training through the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades as to make very decided 
progress toward industrial efficiency in a number of directions. This is not-theory at 
all, gentlemen. If you will come up to our little town you can see this work in prog- 
ress and can determine its effectiveness in holding pupils in the schools, in awakening 
a new interest in them and in the real development of insight into industrial processes 
and of ability in performing them. 
The best thought in manual training to-day is that it is possible to put into the ele- 
mentary course much work in the training of the hand that has not been offered until 
the high school is reached; that it is possible to introduce excellent instructional work 
not generally attempted, work that will be a direct beginning in acquiring a trade or 
vocation. * * * Organize your manual training work in the public schools in 
such a way as to meet this end ultimately, but make the beginning, and make it 
intelligently; do it, as far as you go, along the lines of industrial efficiency, and out of 
it will come something of value in industrial education. 
* * * Tam sorry that in the discussions of this association we do not give more 
space and more time to that question, which seems to me so fundamental, the training 
of the girls. It is a question that is as big industrially as the other question is; it is a 
question that is larger socially; it is larger in a variety of ways; it is worth while to 
consider it. * * * And so it seems to me that for the great mass of the smaller 
cities of this country, if we are going to have anything in the way of intermediate| 
industrial education, it must come in as a part of the existing school system; it will] 
not mean in many cases separate schools even, but it will furnish material whic 
will be added to our present course of study.¢ 
REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON INDUSTRIAL EDUCATIO: 
APPOINTED BY THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR. 
The American Federation of Labor at its twenty-ninth annu 
convention held in Denver, November 9-21, 1908, appointed 
special committee ‘‘to investigate the methods and means of indus   
aSee Bulletin No. 10, Proceedings, Third Annual Meeting, Milwaukee, Wis., National Society for th 
Promotion of Industrial Education.

trial education in this country and abroad with instructions to report 
its conclusions and recommendations at the next annual meeting of 
the federation.” Accordingly a preliminary report of this com- 
mittee was presented at the thirtieth annual meeting which convened 
in Toronto, Canada, in November, 1909. In view of the importance 
and vast extent of the field of investigation, the report submitted 
has a purely tentative character. The position reached by the com- 
mittee in regard to the importance of the subject is expressed in the 
following conclusions: 
     
   
                                           
    
            
    
     
   It is believed that the future welfare of America largely depends on the industrial 
training of our workers and in protecting them. 
The inquiries of the committee seem to indicate that if the American workman is 
to maintain the high standard of efficiency, the boys and girls of the country must 
have an opportunity to acquire educated hands and brains, such as may enable them 
to earn a living in a self-selected vocation and acquire an intelligent understanding of 
the duties of good citizenship. 
No better investment can be made by taxpayers than to give every youth an oppor- 
tunity to secure such an education. Such an opportunity is not now within the reach 
of the great majority of the children of the wage-workers. The present system is 
inadequate and unsatisfactory. Only a small fraction of the children who enter the 
lower grades continue through the grades until they complete the high school course. 
The reasons which seem to be the prime cause for withdrawal are first, a lack of inter- 
est on the part of the pupils; and secondly, on the part of the parents, and a dissatis- 
faction that the schools do not offer instruction of a more practical character. The 
pupils become tired of the work they have in hand and see nothing more inviting in 
the grades ahead. They are conscious of powers, passions, and tastes which the 
school does not recognize. They long to grasp things with their own hands and test 
the strength of materials and the magnitude of forces. 
Owing to past methods and influences, false views and absurd notions possess the 
minds of too many of our youths, which cause them to shun work at the trades and to 
seek the office or store as much more genteel and fitting. This silly notion has been 
shaken by the healthy influence of unions, and will be entirely eradicated if industrial 
training becomes a part of our school system, and in consequence of this system of 
training the youth will advance greatly in general intelligence, as well as in tech- 
nical skill and in mental and moral worth, he will be a better citizen and a better 
an, and will be more valuable to society and to the country. 
The recommendations of the committee pertain first to Supple- 
ental Technical Education, under which head they recommend: 
The continuance of progressive development of supplemental trade education, as 
maugurated by trade unions, and call special attention to the work undertaken by 
he International Typographical Union in the establishment of a school for the higher 
ducation of its members. * * * And the committee further recommend that all 
rade unions which have not adopted a system of technical education give the matter 
he consideration it so richly deserves; and we further believe that the present under- 
kings of the unions call for the most enthusiastic admiration, and are entitled to the 
ost cordial and loyal support. 
Second, under the head of Technical Industrial Education the 
ommittee— 
Favor the establishment of schools in connection with the public school system, at 
‘hich pupils between the ages of 14 and 16 may be taught the principles of the trades,  
-P-A-G-E-238
  
  230 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
not necessarily in separate buildings, but in separate schools adapted to this particular 
education, and by competent and trained teachers. 
The course of instruction in such a school should be English, mathematics, physics, . 
chemistry, elementary mechanics, and drawing. The shop instruction for particular 
trades, and for each trade represented, the drawing, mathematics, mechanics, physical 
and biological science applicable to the trade, the history of that trade, and a sound 
system of economics, including and emphasizing the philosophy of collective bargain- 
ing. This will servé to prepare the pupil for more advanced subjects, and in addition, 
to disclose his capacity for a specific vocation. 
In order to keep such schools in close touch with the trades there should be local 
advisory boards, including representatives of the industries, employers, and organized 
labor. 
The committee recommends that any technical education of the workers in trade 
and industry being a public necessity, it should not be a private but a public function, 
conducted by the public and the expense involved at public cost. 
We recommend the continuance of the life of the committee and fina. report to the 
1910 convention.     
      
    
    
    
    
             
    
   
   
   
     
    This report which was signed by John Mitchell, chairman, and by 
the other. members of the special committee, was referred to the 
committee on education, which, after brief deliberation, reported at 
the same meeting as follows: 
First. We have carefully examined the report of the special committee appointed 
by authority of the Denver convention on industrial education. We heartily indorse 
the action of this committee and fully concur in all the recommendations contained 
in the report, and congratulate the committee on the clear and coricise manner in 
which they have covered the many matters that enter into a question of so much 
importance to the working people and the public in general as the question of indus- 
trial education is at this time. 
We especially recommend that this committee be continued, as suggested in the 
report, to make a final report to the 1910 convention. We also recommend legislation| 
along the lines indicated in the report. 
We also deem it advisable, on account of the great importance of the question, that 
delegates, in reporting to their constituents the work of this convention, make specia! 
mention of this matter, and that the secretary of the American Federation of Labor b 
instructed to have a sufficient number of copies of this report printed to be distribute 
among the organizations affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, upo 
application. 
The report of this committee on education was adopted by th 
Federation as presented.” 
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION—CONFERENCE BEFORE TH 
NATIONAL COUNCIL. 
Differences of opinion as to the form of industrial education whicl 
is most needed at the present time are reflected in the foregoin, 
citations. Undoubtedly provision answering to varied conditions an 
demands will be forthcoming, but to prevent waste in the time o 
students, in teaching force, and finances, it is essential that the pre| 
vailing opinions on the subject should be thoroughly canvassed. I 
this way alone will their points of agreement, and of difference, an

their relation to existing schools be clearly understood by the author- 
ities who have charge of public agencies of education. In view of 
the importance of free interchange of opinions on the subject, a 
conference on industrial and vocational schools was held at a session 
of the National Council of Education, July 6, 1910, on the occasion 
of the annual meeting of the National Education Association, 
Boston, July 2-8, 1910. Through the efforts of Dr. Joseph Swain, 
president of the council, leading representatives of the forces which 
are toshape public opinion inthe matter—manufacturers, labor unions, 
and teachers—unfolded their views in regard to industrial and voca- 
tional education in a series of addresses which were followed by free 
discussion. It was not expected that this conference would formu- 
late any definite plans of action, but it illustrates the essential pre- 
liminary to wise legislation and effective procedure. 
STATE LAWS RELATIVE TO INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
In seven States—Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New 
Jersey, Maryland, Michigan, and Wisconsin—recent laws have been 
enacted relating to vocational training for the industries. In some 
other States existing laws have been construed to permit provision 
for such training as a department of the public school system. The 
more important laws relating to industrial education have been col- 
lated and are presented here in a body. 
Under authority of a resolution of the legislature, the governor 
of Massachusetts in 1905 appointed a commission on industrial edu- 
cation. After some months of investigation this commission made its 
report, which followed a comprehensive presentation of the problems 
of industrial training with the recommendation that a second com- 
mission be appointed for the purposes specified in the second section 
of the law given below. In accordance with this recommendation a 
law was enacted in January, 1906, creating such a commission and 
defining its powers and duties. This law, under which seventeen 
independent industrial schools were approved prior to January 1, 
1910, follows: 
Sxction 1. The governor, by and with the consent of the council shall appoint a 
commission of five persons to be known as the commission on industrial education, 
to serve for the term of three years, and to receive such compensation asthe governor 
and council shall approve. The said commission on its organization shall appoint a 
secretary to be its executive officer, who shall not be a member of the commission, and 
who shall receive such salary as shall be approved by the governor and council, and 
the commission may employ supervisors, experts in industrial and technical educa- 
tion, and such clerical and other service as may be found necessary. The necessary 
expenses of the commission, including clerk hire, traveling expenses, stationery, and 
all other incidental expenses, shall be paid out of the treasury of the Commonwealth, 
as may be provided by law, but shall not exceed the sum of eight thousand dollars 
for the remainder of the present fiscal year.

    Srcrion 2. The commission on industrial education shall be charged with the 
duty of extending the investigation of methods of industrial training and of local needs 
and it shall advise and aid in the introduction of industrial education in the independ- 
ent schools, as hereinafter provided; and it shall provide for lectures on the impor- 
tance of industrial education and kindred subjects, and visit and report upon all 
special schools in which such education is carried on. It may initiate and superin- 
tend the establishment and maintenance of industrial schools for boys and girls in 
various centers of the Commonwealth, with the cooperation and consent of the munici- 
pality involved or the municipalities constituent of any district to be formed by the 
union of towns and cities, as hereinafter provided. The commission shall have all 
necessary powers in the conduct and maintenance of industrial schools, and money 
appropriated by the State and municipality for their maintenance shall be expended 
under its direction. 
Section 3. All cities and towns may provide independent industrial schools for 
instruction in the principles of agriculture and the domestic and mechanic arts, but 
attendance upon such schools of children under fourteen years of age shall not take 
the place of attendance upon public schools as required by law. In addition to these 
industrial schools cities and towns may provide for evening courses for persons already 
employed in trades, and they may also provide, in the industrial schools and evening 
schools herein authorized, for the instruction in part-time classes of children between 
the ages of fourteen and eighteen years who may be employed during the remainder of 
the day, to the end that instruction in the principles and the practice of the arts may 
go on together: Provided, That the independent schools authorized in this section 
shall be approved as to location, courses and methods of instruction by the commis- 
sion on industrial education. 
Srction 4. Two or more cities or towns may unite as a district for the maintenance 
of the industrial schools provided for in the preceding section, but no such district 
shall be created without the approval of the commission on industrial education. 
Section 5. Whenever any city or town or any district, as provided in the preceding 
section, shall appropriate money for the establishment and equipment and mainte- 
nance of independent schools for industrial training, the Commonwealth, in order 
to aid in the maintenance of such schools, shall pay annually from the treasury to such 
cities, towns, or districts, a sum proportionate to the amount raised by local taxation 
and expended for the support of schools for each thousand dollars of valuation, as 
follows: Cities and towns expending more than five dollars for each thousand of valua- 
tion for the support of public schools to be reimbursed by the Commonwealth to the 
amount of one-half, those raising and expending between four and five dollars per 
thousand to the amount of one-third, and those raising and expending less than four 
dollars per thousand to the amount of one-fifth, of the cost of maintaining industrial 
schools: Provided, That no payment to any city or town shall be made except by special 
appropriation by the legislature. 
Section 6. The commission on industrial education shall make a report annually 
to the legislature relative to the condition and progress of industrial education during 
the year, stating what industrial schools have been established and the appropriations 
necessary for their maintenance, in accordance with the preceding section, and mak- 
ing such recommendations as the commission on industrial education may deem advis- 
able; and especially shall the commission consider and report at an early day upon 
the advisability of establishing one or more technical schools or industrial colleges, 
providing for a three or four years’ course for extended training in the working prin- 
ciples of the larger industries of the Commonwealth. 
Section 7. The trustees of the Massachusetts Agricultural College are hereby} 
authorized to establish a normal department for the purpose of giving instruction it 
the elements of agriculture to persons desiring to teach such elements in the publi 
schools, as provided in sections three and four: Provided, That the cost of such depai
-P-A-G-E-241

ment shall not exceed the sum of five thousand dollars in any one year, and that at 
least fifteen candidates present themselves for such instruction. 
Sxctron 8. Section ten of chapter forty-two of the revised laws, and all acts and 
parts of acts inconsistent with this act, are hereby repealed. (Approved June 21, 
1906.) 
In 1908 the term of the commission created by the foregoing act 
was extended to five years and its powers and duties were enlarged, as 
indicated in the following: 
The commission shall have all-necessary powers in the conduct and maintenance 
of independent industrial schools, and money appropriated by the Commonwealth 
or by municipalities for their maintenance shall be expended under its direction 
or with its approval. Any city or town may also establish independent industrial 
schools in charge of a board of trustees which shall have authority to provide and 
maintain such schools. Such schools, if approved by the commission on industrial 
education as to location, courses and methods of instruction, shall receive reimburse- 
ment as provided in section four of said chapter five hundred and five. 
Any resident of Massachusetts may, with the approval of the commission on indus- 
trial education, attend an independent industrial school, as provided for in this act, 
located in any city or town other than that in which he resides, provided there is no 
such school supported in whole or in part by the city or town in which he resides, upon 
payment by the city or town of his residence of such tuition fee as may be fixed by 
said commission; and the Commonwealth shall repay to any city or town one-half 
of all such payments. If any city or town neglects or refuses to pay for such tuition, 
it shall be liable therefor, in an action of contract, to the legally constituted authorities 
of the school which the pupil attended under the approval of said commission. 
In 1909 section 5 of the law of 1906 was amended to read as follows: 
Upon certification by the board of education to the auditor of the Commonwealth 
hat a city, town, or district either by moneys raised by local taxation or by moneys 
onated or contributed, has maintained an independent industrial school, the Com- 
onwealth, in order to aid in the maintenance of such schools, shall pay annually 
‘om the treasury to such cities, towns, or districts, a sum equal to one-half the sum 
ised by local taxation for this purpose: Provided, That no payment to any city or 
ywn shall be made except by special appropriation by the legislature. 
      
       
By another act passed in 1909 the commission on industrial educa- 
ion was consolidated with the state board of education and its powers 
ere transferred to the new board thus constituted. Sections 1 and 
of this act follow: 
The board of education shall consist of nine persons, three of whom shall annually 
April be appointed by the governor, with the advice and consent of the council, for 
rms of three years, except as hereinafter provided. The members of the board shall 
rve without compensation. During the month of June in the current year the gov- 
or shall so appoint all of said nine members of the board, whose terms of office shall 
legin on the first day of July, nineteen hundred and nine, three for terms ending May 
t, nineteen hundred and eleven, three for terms ending May first, nineteen hundred 
d twelve, and three for terms ending May first, nineteen hundred and thirteen. 
ur of the present members of the board of education, and one of the members of the 
mmission on industrial education shall be appointed members of the board of educa- 
m provided for by this act. 
The board of education shall exercise all the powers and be subject to all the duties 
ww conferred or imposed by law upon the present board of education, or upon the

commission on industrial education by chapter five hundred and five of the acts of the 
year nineteen hundred and six and by chapter five hundred and seventy-two of the 
acts of the year nineteen hundred and eight, and acts in amendment thereof and in 
addition thereto, except as may otherwise be provided herein. 
The Wisconsin law, under authority of which the city of Milwaukee 
took control of the Milwaukee School of Trades, was enacted in 1907. 
This law follows: 
Sxction 926—22. Any city in the State of Wisconsin or any school district having 
within its limits a city desiring to establish, conduct and maintain aschool or school: 
for the purpose of giving practical instruction in the useful trades to personshaving 
attained the age of sixteen years, as a part of the public school system of such city, i: 
empowered to do so by complying with the provisions of sections 926—23 to 926—30, 
inclusive, statutes of 1898. 
926—23. Such trade school or schools shall be under the supervision and control 
of the school boards of the respective cities or school districts in which they may 
be located. 
926—24. The school board of every such city or school district is given full power 
and authority to establish, take over and maintain a trade school or schools, equiy 
the same with proper machinery and tools, employ a competent instructor or instruc: 
tors, and give practical instruction in one or more of the common trades. Such ¢ 
trade school shall not be maintained, however, unless there be an average enrollment 
of at least thirty scholars. 
926—25. Whenever any school board shall have established or taken over an estab: 
lished trade school, such school board may prepare the courses of study, employ 
instructors, purchase all machinery, tools and supplies, purchase or lease suitable 
grounds or buildings for the use of such school and exercise the same authority ove 
such school which it now has over the schools under its charge. 
926—26. Whenever any school board shall have established or taken over an already 
established trade school or schools it may appoint an advisory committee, to be know1 
as the committee on trade schools, consisting of five citizens, not members of th 
school board, each of whom is experienced in one or more of the trades to be taugh: 
in the school or schools, to assist in the administration of the trade school or school: 
located in that city, which committee shall be appointed by the president of suc! 
school board with the approval of a majority of the board. Such committee shal 
have authority, subject to the approval and ratification of the school board, to pr 
pare courses of study, employ or dismiss instructors, purchase machinery, tools an 
supplies, and purchase or rent suitable grounds or buildings for the use of such trad 
schools. When any such committee on trade schools is appointed two of its ori; 
members shall be appointed for the term of one year, another two for the term of tw] 
years, and the fifth member for a term of three years, and thereafter, each memb: 
of said committee shall be appointed for the term of two years. In case of an 
vacancy during the term of any member of said committee, said school board sha! 
fill such vacancy by appointment for such unexpired term. 
926—27. Students attending any such trade school may be required to pay for al 
material consumed by them in their work in such school at cost prices or in lieu there: 
the school board may establish a fixed sum to be paid by each student in each cour: 
which sum shall be sufficient to cover, as nearly as may be, the cost of the materi 
to be consumed in such course; any manufactured articles made in such school 
be disposed of at the discretion of the school board, and the proceeds shall be pai 
into the trade school fund. 
926—28. Whenever any such school board shall have decided to establish a 
school or schools, or to take over one already established, under the provisions of

   act, a tax, not exceeding one half of one mill on the total assessed valuation of such 
city shall be levied, upon the requisition of the school board, as other school taxes 
are levied in such city; the fund derived from such taxation shall be known as the 
trade school fund, shall be used in establishing and maintaining a trade school or 
trade schools in such city, shall not be diverted or used for any other purpose what- 
soever, and may be disposed of and disbursed by the school board of such city in 
the same manner and pursuant to the same regulations governing the disposition and 
disbursement of regular school funds by such boards. 
926—29. Any school board desiring to avail itself of the provisions of this act, may 
before the trade school fund herein provided for becomes available, establish, take 
over, equip and maintain a trade school or schools out of the regular school funds 
which may be at the disposal of such school board, provided, however, that all moneys 
used for these purposes out of the regular school funds shall be refunded within three 
years from the trade school fund. 
926—30. 1. When the school board of any city of the second, third or fourth class, 
or the school board of any school district having within its limits such a city, shall 
determine to establish, take over, conduct or maintain such trade school, it shall 
publish notice of its intention so to do with a copy of the resolution or order express- 
ing such determination once each week for four successive weeks in a newspaper 
published in said school district and shall take no further steps in said matter until 
the expiration of thirty days from the date of the first publication. 
2. If within such thirty days there shall be filed with the clerk of such city a peti- 
tion signed by a number of electors of the school district equal to twenty per centum 
of the number of votes cast in said city at the last municipal election praying that 
the question of the establishment, taking over, conduct and maintenance of such 
trade school shall be submitted to the vote of the electors of such school district, the 
‘ity clerk shall at the earliest opportunity lay such petition before the common coun-

  236 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
The industrial and trade school act passed by the New York 
state legislature, May 18, 1908, provided for the establishment of 
industrial and trade schools as follows: 
820. General industrial and trade schools may be established—1. The board of edu- 
cation of any city, and in a city not having a board of education the officer having 
the management and supervision of the public school system, may establish, acquire, 
conduct and maintain as part of the public school system of such city general indus- 
trial schools open to pupils who have completed the elementary school course or 
who have attained the age of fourteen years, and trade schools open to pupils who 
have attained the age of sixteen years and have completed either the elementary 
school course or a course in the above mentioned general industrial school or who 
have met such other requirements as the local school authorities may have prescribed. 
2. The board of education of any union free school district shall also establish, 
acquire, and maintain such school for like purposes whenever such schools shall be 
authorized by a district meeting. 
821. Appointment of an advisory board—1. The board of education in a city and 
the officer having the management and supervision of the public school system in a 
city not having a board of education shall appoint an advisory board of five members 
representing the local trades and industries. In the first instance two of such members 
shall be appointed for a term of one year and three of such members shall be appointed 
for a term of two years. Thereafter as the terms of such members shall expire the 
vacancies caused thereby shall be filled for a full term of two years. Any other 
vacancy occurring on such board shall be filled by the appointing power named in) 
this section for the remainder of the unexpired term. 
2. It shall be the duty of such advisory board to counsel with and advise the board] 
of education or the officer having the management and supervision of the publi 
school system in a city not having a board of education in relation to the powers an 
duties vested in such board or officer by section eight hundred twenty-two of thi: 
chapter. 
822. Authority of the board of education over such schools.—The board of educatio: 
in a city and the officer having the management and supervision of the public schoo! 
system in a city not having a board of education and the board of education in a unio: 
free school district which authorizes the establishment of a general industrial or 
trade school is vested with the same power and authority over the management, 
supervision, and control of such school and the teachers or instructors employe 
therein as such board or officer now has over the schools and teachers under thei 
charge. Such boards of education or such officer shall also have full power an 
authority— . 
1. To employ competent teachers or instructors. 
2. To provide proper courses of study. 
3. To purchase or acquire sites and grounds and to purchase, acquire, lease, o 
construct, and to repair suitable shops or buildings, and to properly equip the sam 
4, To purchase necessary machinery, tools, apparatus, and supplies. 
823. State aid for general industrial and trade schools.—The commissioner of educatio: 
in the annual apportionment of the state school moneys shall apportion therefrom t 
each city and union free school district the sum of five hundred dollars for each i: 
dependently organized general industrial or trade school maintained therein f 
forty weeks during the school year and employing one teacher whose work is devote) 
exclusively to such school, and having an enrollment of at least twenty-five pupil 
and maintaining a course of study approved by him. He shall also make an additio 
apportionment to each city and union free school district of two hundred dollars fi 
each additional teacher employed exclusively in such schools for forty weeks durii 
the school year. All such moneys apportioned by the commissioner of educati

hall be used exclusively for the support and maintenance of such schools in the city 
r district to which such moneys are apportioned. But the commissioner of educa- 
ion may in his discretion apportion to a district or city maintaining such schools 
r employing such teachers for a shorter time than forty weeks an amount pro rata 
o the time such schools are maintained or such teachers are employed. This section 
hall not be construed to entitle manual training high schools or other secondary 
chools maintaining manual training departments to an apportionment of funds 
erein provided for. 
824. Annual estimate by board of education and appropriations by municipal and 
chool districts—1. The board of education of each city or the officer having the 
nanagement and supervision of the public school system in a city not having a board 
£ education shall file with the common council of such city within thirty days after 
he commencement of the fiscal year of such city a written itemized estimate of the 
xpenditures necessary for the maintenance of its general industrial and trade schools 
nd the estimated amount which the city will receive from the state school moneys 
pplicable to the support of such schools. The common council shall give a public 
earing to such persons as wish to be heard in reference thereto. The common council 
hall adopt such estimate and after deducting therefrom the amount of state moneys 
pplicable to the support of such schools shall include the balance in the annual tax 
udget of such city. Such amount shall be levied, assessed, and raised by tax upon 
he real and personal property liable to taxation in the city at the time and in the 
nanner that other taxes for school purposes are raised. The common council shall 
ave power by a two-thirds vote to reduce or reject any item included in such estimate. 
The board of education in a union free school district which maintains a general 
ndustrial or trade school shall include in its estimate of anticipated expenses pursuant 
o the provisions of sections two hundred forty-two and two hundred and forty-seven 
f this chapter the amount that will be required to maintain such schools after applying 
oward the maintenance thereof the amount apportioned therefor by the commisssioner 
f education. Such amount shall thereafter be levied, assessed, and raised by tax 
(pon the taxable property of the district at the time and in the manner that other 
xes for school purposes are raised in such district. 
     
   
      
   
    
    
    
      
      
   By the following enactment of 1909, Connecticut authorized the 
tate board of education to establish two trade schools: 
Sec. 1. The state board of education is hereby authorized and directed to establish 
each of the two towns in the State which may seem to said board best adapted 
x the purpose, a free public day and evening school, for instruction in the arts and 
actices of trades, and said board may make regulations covering the admittance 
scholars, but no person shall be admitted to schools established under the pro- 
sions of this act under fourteen years of age; provided, however, that, during vaca- 
ms, said board may admit children under fourteen years of age. 
Sec. 2. The state board of education shall expend the funds provided for the sup- 
rt of trade schools, appoint and remove their teachers, make rules for their manage- 
lent, and shall file semiannually with the comptroller, to be audited by him, a 
tement of expenses on account of such schools, and shall annually make to the 
yvernor a report of the condition of such schools and the doings of said board in 
nection therewith. Said board may enter into arrangements with manufacturing 
d mechanical establishments in which pupils of such trade schools may have op- 
tunity to obtain half-time practice, and may also enter into and make arrangements 
th schools already established for instruction in trades approved by said board 
der the provisions of this act. 
xc. 3. When such schools are established under the provisions of this act, the 
te board of education may construct buildings, or hire, temporarily, rooms in 
ich such schools shall be housed, and said board shall be authorized to expend 
   
-P-A-G-E-246
  238 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
not more than fifty thousand dollars, annually, for the purpose of erecting buildin; 
and maintaining such schools. 
Src. 4. Any town in which a trade school is established under the provisions « 
this act may contribute any sum properly voted therefor to the enlargement of suc 
school, and for the improvement of its efficiency. 
Sc. 5. Chapter 250 of the public acts of 1907 is hereby repealed. (Chap. 8 
June 23, 1909.) 
By authority of a joint resolution of the senate and general assemb! 
of New Jersey, approved April 14, 1908, the governor of the Stat 
appointed a commission ‘‘to inquire into and report to the nex 
legislature upon the subject of promoting industrial and technic: 
education.”” The commission made its report in 1909. 
By act of the legislature in 1908 the governor of Maryland we 
authorized to appoint a commission ‘‘to make inquiry and repot 
to the legislature at its next session, by bill or otherwise, respectin 
the subject of industrial education.” This commission made it 
report in 1910. 
In 1909, by authority of an act of the legislature, the governor « 
Michigan appointed a commission ‘‘to make a careful study of th 
conditions of elementary, industrial, and agricultural education i 
the State of Michigan” and to present a report with recommendatior 
before January 1, 1911. 
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IN NEW YORK. 
In accordance with the provisions of the industrial and trade scho 
act, a division of trade schools was organized in the state departmer 
of education in 1908, with Mr. Arthur D. Dean as chief. The repo: 
of this division shows that eleven schools of the new type have alread 
been organized, located as follows: In the cities of Albany, Buffal 
Freeville, Hudson, Lancaster, New York, Rochester (two schools 
Schenectady, and Yonkers (two schools). These schools are ni 
intended to parallel the work of the high school or to supplant t 
manual-training courses in any of the regular schools, but are orga: 
ized for the purpose of giving specific vocational training.¢ 
In view of the progress already accomplished in New York Sta 
in respect to practical provision for various types of industrial scho 
under the administration of the department of public education, so 
what extended citations are here given from the report referred to: 
The trades schools will differ from the manual-training courses in the second 
schools in the following particulars: 
1. Pupils enter the trades schools with a definite purpose of preparing for industi 
careers. 
2. The trades school absolutely abandons all college preparatory work. 
3. There is almost no instruction in pure mathematics or pure science, but instea, 
fair amount of time is given to such applied mathematics and applied science

closely related to the trade selected by the pupil; in fact, all the instruction, whether 
in classroom, shop, or laboratory, is designed so as to be directly usable. 
4. The trades schools will necessarily take on varying forms in different localities. 
5. They will not be parallel to our existing high schools in that they will not neces- 
sarily draw pupils who have completed the eight grades of the elementary schools. 
6. They will make more or less direct connection with the intermediate industrial 
schools previously outlined. 
7. Those students in the trade schools who have had preliminary industrial training 
in the vocational schools will be allowed to take highly specialized courses with their 
instruction concentrating upon the development of skill and knowledge of direct 
practical bearing.     
    
         
    
       
        
    
   
     
    
    
             
     
    
     Further quotation from the report is here made for the purpose of 
showing the need of improved vocational training in New York State: 
In this State there are over 50,000 people employed in printing and allied trades. 
here are five cities that should have a school for printers and lithographers. We may 
ook for at least three textile schools for the 75,000 people who are engaged in the textile 
ndustry. The State should contain at least one shoe trade or technical school to fit 
orkers for an industry that employs about 17,000 workers. Through private enter- 
rise New York has a school for the workers on ready-made clothing. There are 
30,000 people employed in this industry and one school is entirely inadequate and 
oes not touch the problem in Rochester at all. The electrical machinery apparatus 
nd supply industries require the services of 16,000 workers. A school of lower grade 
han an electrical engineering school would be of much benefit to such people. At 
east three such schools are needed in the State. There are 55,000 men and boys 
mployed in the foundry and machine shops of the State. There are at least eighteen 
ities in the State that have sufficient iron-working industries and workers to warrant 
achine trades schools. There are two large paper manufacturing centers within the 
tate employing 12,000 workers. A high standard of manufacture, excellence of 
orkmanship, and personal ambition of workers in the State can not always be main- 
ined without attention to the special educational needs of these workers. There 
re 15,000 people employed in car shops and railroad repair shops. Men’s furnishing 
foods and shirt industries have over 26,000 workers, furniture making 16,000, planing 
ills 15,000, etc. A man’s work is worthy of being dignified by special education 
tting him for it. The quicker we realize it the better for the interests of the State. 
In addition to the specific trade training mentioned above, the new 
ocational schools offer intermediate industrial courses which do not 
sume to give complete trade training, but which are designed to 
eet the needs of pupils from 13 to 16 years of age who have lost 
terest in the more academic courses of the regular schools. 
INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES. 
Industrial education in the United States is still in a formative 
ate. Moreover, a wide variance of opinion prevails as to what is 
acticable in industrial training and even as to the meanings of terms 
ed in current discussions of this type of education. Because of these 
nditions any attempt to list and classify industrial schools in the 
untry at the present time must necessarily be tentative. Accord- 
gly the lists presented here are arranged more with a view toshowing 
e character and extent of training for industrial vocations than to

   giving a complete directory of industrial schools with satisfactory 
classification. Such classification as is attempted is based on data 
furnished by the schools themselves. 
The field dealt with in this chapter is that department of education 
which pertains to vocations in the industries. The courses of instruc- 
tion in domestic art and domestic science usually look toward home- 
making and are not strictly vocational in aim. In a few of the larger 
cities, however, dressmaking and millinery are studied with a view to 
a vocation in the industries. 
In general, there may be said to be three types or grades of indus 
trial training: (1) Complete trade training, in which the effort is made| 
to graduate finished mechanics or skilled workers capable of doin: 
journeymen’s work and earning journeymen’s wages. (2) Interme 
diate, or preapprentice, trade training, in which it is sought to shorte 
the period of apprenticeship or to give skill and intelligence prepara- 
tory to an industrial occupation. (3) Industrial improvement o: 
supplementary instruction for those already engaged in industrial 
pursuits. It will be seen that some schools offer all three of thes: 
types, some offer two of them, and others offer only one. 
In the lists which follow four groups are shown: General industrial 
schools, or institutions having industrial departments; schools for th 
colored race which give trade training; Indian industrial schools; an 
technical high schools. These schools are not as a rule purely trad 
schools. On the contrary, many of them were organized primaril. 
for another purpose than trade training, but have added this featur 
This is particularly true of the colleges in the South for the colore 
people and of the technical high schools. 
The general list of industrial schools (Group A) shows the source 
of support and the kind of instruction offered by each institution, i 
so far as its character and aims could be ascertained. In all, 14 
institutions are included in this group. It appears that the number 
trade schools proper is small, the greater number of those in the li 
offering only intermediate or supplementary training. It is signi 
cant that a larger percentage of private and privately endow 
schools than of those maintained at public expense attempt to grad 
uate finished skilled workers. 
The schools for the colored race are put in a separate group (Gro 
B) for the reason that trade instruction for the colored people 
given in institutions of a distinctly different type from those of Gro 
A. Most of these schools are primarily academic and cultural in ai 
and it has not been possible to classify the trade training offered 
them as it is classified in Group A. Some of them, however, in thi 
industrial departments graduate efficient workmen. 
The list of Indian schools (Group C) was prepared for the Bure 
of Education by the Office of Indian Affairs. For the most pai 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
     
                    
   
                INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES. 241 
the schools included are nonreservation boarding schools, and offer 
instruction of a more advanced grade than that of the reservation 
schools, but generally the effort is not made to graduate finished 
skilled workers. 
The list of high schools (Group D) pertains to the class of institu- 
tions usually called “technical high schools.” These schools as a rule 
are designed to prepare either for entrance into the higher technical 
colleges or for a semitechnical vocation in the industries. Some offer 
specific trade training and give supplementary instruction (usually by 
evening classes) to those already engaged in industrial pursuits. In 
the schools comprised in Group D the vocational aim is more or less 
prominent, whatever the type or grade of the instruction given. 
In a complete directory of the industrial schools of the country a 
fifth group should be added to those given here, namely, the state- 
supported schools for the deaf and blind and the state reform schools 
for juvenile offenders. With few exceptions all the schools referred 
to make provision for some form of industrial training, but satisfac- 
tory classification is here well-nigh impossible. Reform schools rarely 
keep an offender long enough to teach him a trade. On the contrary, 
in schools for the deaf some very efficient skilled workers are devel- 
ped. Lists of the several classes of schools referred to as forming a 
fth group may be found in the second volume of the Annual Report 
f the Commissioner of Education.

INCREASING DEMAND FOR EDUCATION IN AGRICULTURE. 
     
     
   
     
    
    
   
    
    The increasing demand for education in agriculture is simply one 
eature of the general movement for the uplift of rural life and develop- 
ent of ruralindustries that is now going on in this country. During 
he year the teaching of agriculture in the public schools, including 
he place it should occupy in the course of study and the methods by 
hich it may be made most fruitful of results, has been a prominent 
ubject of consideration at teachers’ conventions, farmers’ institutes, 
d in professional journals and the public press. Twelve formal 
ddresses on different phases of agricultural education were given at 
he annual meeting of the National Education Association, held in 
oston, July 5-8, 1910. The department of rural and agricultural 
ducation, after devoting two days to the subject, met in joint session 
ith the department of science and the department of secondary 
ducation and devoted one day to the topic, ‘‘The practical aspects 
f science with reference to the introduction of material from agri- 
The national committee on agricultural education pre- 
lented a programme requiring a half-day session, and the teachers of 
riculture held a half-day session in conference with discussions on 
roblems vital to them. At the annual conference for education in 
e South, held in April, 1910, at Little Rock, Ark., four of the sixteen 
ddresses given in the general sessions were on agricultural educa- 
on, and, in addition, a special conference on the subject, with six 
dresses, was held. It is worthy of note that the discussions at the

teachers’ conventions and in the professional journals are no longer 
on the question, ‘‘Should agriculture be taught in the public schools?” 
but are on questions related to the teaching of the subject. 
       
         
    
          
   
   
     
   
   PROVISION FOR TRAINING TEACHERS OF AGRICULTURE FOR THE 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
The agricultural colleges have taken up the work of preparing teach- 
ers of agriculture for the public schools, and have been particularly 
activein systemizing their facilities for suchinstruction. Departments 
of agricultural education, variously named as department of agricul- 
tural education, department of agricultural pedagogy, department of 
industrial education, or department of rural education, have been 
recently established in many of the land-grant colleges of the United) 
States. Most of these departments were established in 1908 or 1909| 
following the act of Congress of March 4, 1907, appropriating addi- 
tional funds for the support of the land-grant colleges and providing, 
“That said colleges may use a portion of this money for providin: 
courses for the special preparation of instructors for teaching thi 
elements of agriculture and mechanic arts.” 
The list of States having land-grant colleges, from which suck 
departments have been reported, is as follows:

         In response to the demand for teachers qualified to give instruction 
agriculture, in both elementary and secondary schools, the normal 
hools of the country are equipping themselves for the work. About 
60 normal schools are now giving regular courses in agriculture, and 
veral announce special courses for teachers who wish to engage 
ermanently in work in rural schools; for example, Lewiston (Idaho) 
tate Normal School announces for the coming year a course of 
aining for teachers of rural schools, including rural sociology, deal- 
g largely with the relation of the rural school to the community; 
ral-school management; rural arts; and rural sciences, including 
riculture, school gardening, and nature study. This school has 
tablished also a department of extension work for rural schools. 
his department will aid in planning school buildings where new 
hools are to be erected or old ones remodeled; in furnishing advice 
garding equipment; in supplying lecturers for teachers’ institutes;

in directing work in elementary agriculture, school gardening, an 
domestic arts, and in supplying teachers. 
The Maryland state board of education has selected a farm of 17 
acres near Bowie, on the Pennsylvania Railroad between Baltimor 
and Washington, as a site for a new state normal school for negroes 
Instruction will be given in mechanic arts, trades, agriculture, an 
domestic sciences. George H. C. Williams has been appointe 
principal. 
The North Adams (Massachusetts) State Normal School now offer; 
a three-year course in school and home gardening and nature stud, 
and a four-year course in agriculture and horticulture to prepar| 
teachers for public-school work, both in the grades and high schoo 
The first course may be completed by graduates of the state norm: 
schools by one year’s additional work and the second course by tw 
years’ work. The courses have been arranged and are conducted i 
cooperation with the Massachusetts Agricultural College, which fu 
nishes a supervisor who gives a portion of his time to the normal schoo 
a second portion to the promotion of elementary agriculture in t 
schools of the county, and the remainder to the college. 
The last session of the Ohio legislature provided for the establis 
ment of two additional state normal schools, one to be located in t! 
northeast section of the State, the other in the northwest. Agric 
ture must be included in the curricula of both schools. 
The three state normal schools of Texas, in accordance with 
act of the last legislature, will establish courses in agriculture. T 
Sam Houston Normal Institute, at Huntsville, has employed a speci 
teacher of agriculture, and erected a new building containing lectu 
rooms and laboratories for agricultural instruction. 
In addition to the regular courses of instruction in agricultu 
many normal schools announce short courses in the subject, special 
adapted to the teachers of rural schools. As a rule, these courses aj 
maintained during the summer, but in several instances simil. 
courses are arranged for the winter months, having special referen 
to the interests of young people from farming districts, who may p 
pose becoming teachers. 
TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS. _ 
The movement for establishing agricultural schools of seconda} 
grade is making progress, as is indicated by the following particul 
relating to recent legislative measures or practical experime 
directed to that purpose: 
In accordance with an act passed by the legislature of Arkansas 
1909, the State was divided into four districts for the location of f 
agricultural schools. The act provided that the governor sho 
appoint the boards of managers in each district, under whose adv:
-P-A-G-E-267
  AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 259 
he locations of the schools have been determined as follows: First 
istrict, at Jonesboro; second district, at Russellville; third district, 
t Magnolia; and fourth district, at Monticello. 
A department of agriculture was established in the Stockton (Cal.) 
Tigh School at the opening of the school year in September, 1910. 
t is proposed to make this department of the greatest possible sery- 
ce, both in the teaching of agriculture to boys and to those who 
xpect to become teachers in the county schools, and in giving dem- 
nstrations and conducting experiments for farmers of the county. 
‘he plan includes a four-year course in agriculture, dealing particu- 
arly with the agricultural problems of San Joaquin County; a two- 
ear course to meet the needs of the actual farmer; an agricultural 
ourse open to students preparing to become teachers; short courses 
or farmers and others interested in agriculture; and a four-year course 
n household arts for girls. The director of the department will also 
upervise the nature study, elementary agriculture, and school garden- 
ng in the elementary schools, but will not devote more than one-third 
f his time to teaching. A part of his time will be given to a study 
t first hand of the agricultural problems throughout the farm area 
ributary to Stockton. A portion of the high-school site of 10 acres 
s to be used for experimental agriculture. During the past year the 
stockton High School had an enrollment of 450 students. 
The special state appropriation to departments of agriculture in 
,ouisiana high schools amounts to about $1,200 for each school. In 
rder to secure this appropriation, the schools must meet the follow- 
g requirements, issued by the state department of education:    
   
       
       
   
      
        
       
      1. The school must have a demonstration farm of as much as 5 acres, in one body, 
d an option on an additional 5 acres which may be secured in the event it should 
le needed. 
2. The demonstration farm must have around it a fence that is proof against rabbits, 
ickens, and stock. 
3. There must be a barn with as many as five stalls for horses and cattle, a weevil- 
‘oof grain bin containing as much as 1,500 cubic feet, a fertilizer room, a hayloft, 
da tool room. (Plans of suitable barns will be furnished upon application.) 
4. Apparatus for teaching the sciences. 
(a) If the agricultural department is in a state approved high school, there must 
$100 worth of apparatus selected especially for the teaching of agriculture, and in 
dition to this the school must have the apparatus required of all approved high 
thools. 
(b) If the school is not an approved high school, it must have as much as $100 worth 
apparatus for agricultural teaching. Should there be classes in the school through 
e ninth grade, there must be as much as $76 worth of additional apparatus; if there 
le classes in the tenth grade, there must be as much as $150 worth of apparatus in 
dition to the two amounts named above. 
5. (a) Tools: The school must have as much as $40 worth of tools. (b) Implements: 
e school must own as much as $140 worth of farm implements. (List of apparatus, 
1s, and implements may be secured upon application.) (¢) The school must own 
orse or mule. (d) The school must have an appropriation of $250, which may be 
d as the local authorities think best in promoting the work in agriculture. 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
  260 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910, 
6. The school must employ a teacher of agriculture satisfactory to the departmen 
of education. He must be a graduate of an agricultural college, and he should hav 
had some practical experience in farming. He must not be the principal of the schoo 
He must be employed for twelve months of the year, and he must not be required t 
teach any class in the school outside of the department of agriculture, with the excey 
tion that he may be permitted to do all of the work in botany and zoology if thes 
subjects are given an agricultural turn. 
The Massachusetts state board of education was authorized by ac 
of the legislature, session of 1910, to investigate and report on th 
needs and possibilities of agricultural education in that State an 
the practicability of establishing a farm school in Worcester, Mass 
the report to be made to the legislature not later than the secon 
Wednesday in January, 1911. Mr. Rufus W. Stimson, director ¢ 
the Smith’s Agricultural School at Northampton, an institution o 
secondary grade, has been employed to make the investigation an 
to prepare the report. The executive officers of the state boarc 
Dr. David Snedden, commissioner of education, and Charles A 
Prosser, deputy commissioner in charge of industrial educatior 
together with Mr. Stimson, have already issued a pamphlet, contain 
ing preliminary questions as a basis of discussion, which has bee 
sent to a large number of educators, farmers, and business men ¢ 
the State, inviting criticism of statements contained therein an 
suggestions. A printed report will be made by the state board ¢ 
education to the state legislature, containing such recommendation 
as may be adopted by the board. 
The Smith’s Agricultural School and Northampton School ¢ 
Technology, referred to above, was opened at Northampton, Mass 
in the fall of 1908. The school is supported in part by the proceed 
of a fund amounting to $310,660.39 bequeathed to Northampton b 
Mr. Oliver Smith. The legislature has been petitioned by the tru 
tees of the school to provide annual state aid equal in amount to tl 
income annually received under the Oliver Smith will, it being pr 
vided that the amount paid by the State in any one year shall n 
exceed $12,000. 
At the 1910 session of the Mississippi legislature an act was pass 
authorizing the school board of each county in the State to establi 
not more than two agricultural high schools, one for white yout 
exclusively, and the other for colored youths. These schools are 
give instruction in high-school branches, theoretical and practic 
agriculture, and domestic science. The schools are to be bui 
equipped, and supported by a county tax; the tax levy for agric 
tural high-school purposes in any one year shall not exceed two mi 
If 20 per cent of the qualified voters of a county file with the clerk 
the county board of supervisors, within twenty days after a le 
has been made, a petition asking that the tax for the support of o 
or both agricultural high schools be not levied, then the questi     
      
    
    
   
        
-P-A-G-E-269

shall be submitted to an election of the qualified electors of the county 
within thirty days after the next meeting of the board of supervisors 
after the filing of the petition, at which election the electors may 
vote for or against the tax. A majority vote shall determine whether 
the tax shall be collected or not. 
The schools are to be governed by a board of trustees, five in num- 
ber, two of whom are to be elected by the board of supervisors, two 
by the county school board, and the county school superintendent 
shall constitute the fifth member. No school shall be recognized by 
the state board of education until it has 20 acres of land. 
The Mississippi legislature in 1908 authorized the establishment éf 
one agricultural school in each county. This law was declared uncon- 
stitutional by the supreme court, as no provision was made for colored 
youths. A school established under its authority is now recognized 
by the act of 1910 as one of the two schools which may be established. 
The legislature appropriated $1,000 each to the Chickasaw and the 
Jasper County agricultural high schools, established in 1909. 
The board of education of Colebrook, N. H., voted to establish in 
the high school an agricultural curriculum and a domestic-science or 
home-economics curriculum, and to employ special teachers trained 
in these subjects for each course. The school is called the Colebrook 
Academy and is supported partly by a fund in the hands of a board 
of trustees, but chiefly by the town of Colebrook, and is under the 
direction of the board-of education of the town. At its recent annual 
school meeting the town voted a bond issue of $30,000 for a new 
building. : 
The state legislature of Oklahoma in May, 1908, provided for the 
establishment of six secondary agricultural schools. These schools 
have now been located: The Connors State School of Agriculture at 
Warner, Muskogee County; the Murray State School of Agriculture 
at Tishomingo, Johnston County; the Haskell State School of Agri- 
culture at Broken Arrow, Tulsa County; the Panhandle Agricultural 
Institute at Goodwell, Texas County; the Fifth District State School 
of Agriculture at Helena, Alfalfa County; and the Cameron State 
School of Agriculture at Lawton, Comanche County. The location, 
operation, and equipment of the schools are under the supervision of 
the state commission of agriculture and industrial education, con- 
isting of the state superintendent of public instruction, the president 
f the state board of agriculture, and the president of the Oklahoma 
gricultural and Mechanical College. 
An agricultural and industrial department has been established 
t the Lyndon Institute, Lyndon Center, Vt., opening in September, 
910. It is proposed to give training in practical and scientific agri- 
ulture. The course will cover two years of nine months each and 
be open to residents of the State eligible for admission to any

    approved high school. The theoretical work will be done at the 
institute and the practical work at the school farm. The expenses 
for the school year for boarding pupils will be about $160, which may 
be paid in one of two ways: By the cash-payment system or by the 
work-payment system. Students electing to pay their expenses by 
the latter system will be required to remain at the institute during 
the summer vacation and work on the school farm, for which they 
will be paid at the rate of $25 per month. During the school year 
they will be paid 15 cents an hour for their labor. The establish- 
ment of the school has been made possible through a gift of Theodore 
N. Vail, president of the American Telegraph and Telephone Com- 
pany. In addition to the school farm, Mr. Vail’s 5,000-acre farm at 
Lyndon, with its modern buildings, equipment, and thoroughbred 
stock, is available for demonstration purposes. Mr. Arthur R. Mer- 
rill, B. S., a graduate of the New Hampshire College of Agriculture 
and Mechanic Arts, has been appointed director of the school and 
will have four assistants associated with him in the agricultural 
department. 
By act of the Virginia legislature, approved March 16, 1910, the 
state board of education will select one public high school in each 
congressional district in which shall be established courses in agri- 
culture, the domestic arts and sciences, and manual training, in 
addition to the academic courses already prescribed. At least one- 
fourth of the school time shall be devoted to-these subjects. Five 
acres of land must be obtained for field work in teaching agriculture. 
The State has provided for an annual appropriation of $30,000 for 
the benefit of these schools, and an additional sum of $25,000, avail- 
able in March, 1911, for providing buildings and equipment. This 
act amends one passed in 1908 providing for instruction in agricul- 
ture in high schools, under the provisions of which agricultural courses 
were established in ten schools, each receiving $2,000 state aid. A 
new feature of the act of 1910 is a provision authorizing the use of 
the agricultural high schools as centers for directing demonstration 
farm work and other extension work throughout the district, such| 
work to be conducted under such rules and regulations as the state 
board of education and the president of the Virginia College of Agri- 
culture and Polytechnic Institute may prescribe. An annual appro 
priation of $10,000, available in March, 1911, is made for the work. 
MOVEMENT FOR SECURING FEDERAL AID, 
Efforts are still being made to secure federal aid for instructio: 
in agriculture of high-school grade. Hon. Charles R. Davis, wh: 
introduced the bill in the Sixtieth Congress commonly called th 
“Davis bill,” providing for federal funds for agricultural instruction 
has since recast the measure, and the revised bill in its latest for
-P-A-G-E-271
  AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 263, 
was introduced in the House of Representatives on February 10,1910. 
It is designated as ‘‘H. R. 20374,” and is entitled ‘A billto cooperate 
with the States in encouraging instruction in agriculture, the trades 
and industries, and home economics in secondary schools; in pre- 
paring teachers for those vocational subjects in state normal schools, 
and to appropriate money therefor and to regulate its expenditure.”’ 
The original bill provided for an appropriation ‘‘for the mainte- 
nance of instruction in agriculture and home economics in agricul- 
tural schools of secondary grade, and instruction in mechanic arts 
and in home economics in city schools of secondary grade, a sum 
of money equal to not more than 10 cents per capita of the popula- 
tion of each State and Territory and the District of Columbia; 
* * * for the maintenance of normal instruction in agriculture, 
home economics, and mechanic arts in state and territorial normal 
schools, * * * an additional sum of money equal to not more 
than 1 cent per capita; * * * for the maintenance of branch 
agricultural experiment stations on the farms of the secondary 
agricultural schools appropriated for in this act, a sum equal to 
one-fourth of the sum allotted to it under this act for secondary 
agricultural schools. * * *” : 
The new bill provides for ‘‘state district agricultural schools” 
and also ‘‘for instruction in the trades and industries, and home eco- 
nomics and agriculture, in public schools of secondary grade.” It 
provides for a general appropriation for such instruction instead of a 
per capita appropriation as provided in the original bill, and it appor- 
tions the amounts to be used for the district agricultural schools, 
the public schools, the normal schools, and the experiment sta- 
tions. This portion of the bill reads as follows: 
Be tt enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America 
in Congress assembled, That commencing with the fiscal year beginning July first, 
nineteen hundred and thirteen, there shall be appropriated, out of any money in the 
Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to be paid as hereinafter provided to the respect- 
ive States and Territories and to the District of Columbia, for the maintenance of 
instruction in agriculture and home economics in state district agricultural schools 
of secondary grade, as herein provided, the sum of four million dollars annually; for 
the maintenance of branch agricultural experiment stations to be located at said agri- 
cultural secondary schools, to be administered as parts of the respective state experi- 
ment stations now established or which may hereafter be established in the respective 
States and Territories, in accordance with the act of Congress approved March second, 
eighteen hundred and eighty-seven, the sum of one million dollars annually; for the 
maintenance of instruction in the trades and industries, and home economics and agri- 
culture, in public schools of secondary grade, the sum of five million dollars annually; 
and that commencing with the fiscal year beginning July first, nineteen hundred and 
ten, there is hereby appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise 
appropriated, for the maintenance of instruction in agriculture, in trades, in industries, 
and in home economics in state and territorial normal schools, the sum of one million 
dollars annually. 
Sec. 2. That the funds appropriated under this act for education in public secondary 
schools and in state normal schools shall be allotted to the States and Territories and 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
  264 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
the District of Columbia in proportion to their population as shall be determined by 
the census of nineteen hundred and ten, and that the funds for the district agricultural 
high schools and branch experiment stations shall be apportioned to the respective 
States and Territories in proportion to the persons engaged in agricultural pursuits as 
shall be shown by the census of nineteen hundred and ten: Provided, That in each State 
and Territory with less than three hundred thousand inhabitants there is hereby appro- 
priated for normal-school instruction the additional sum of three thousand dollars, 
and that to each State and Territory with less than one hundred thousand people 
engaged in agricultural pursuits there is hereby appropriated for district agricultural 
high schools the additional sum of five thousand dollars annually, and for branch 
experiment station work the additional sum of two thousand five hundred dollars 
annually. 
Src. 3. That each State and Territory in order to secure the benefits of this act shall 
accept its provisions and shall divide the State or Territory into districts, providing 
in each district for one secondary agricultural school and a branch experiment station, 
the total number of such districts in a given State or Territory to be not less than one 
for each fifteen counties nor more than one for each five counties and fraction of five 
counties; and shall enact laws providing for the allotment of the funds herein appro- 
priated to the respective schools to which it may choose to allot funds under the pro- 
visions of this act, and shall provide for the administration of the use of the respective 
funds herein appropriated: Provided, That in States where separate schools are main- 
tained for the colored race the allotment of money for the encouragement of instruc- 
tion in the aforesaid vocations shall be divided in each State in proportion to the popu- 
lation of the two races, respectively, and whether the districts for agricultural second- 
ary schools for the two races are conterminous or not conterminous their total number 
shall be determined by the number of districts permissible under the provisions of 
this act: Provided, That in case the legislature of any State or Territory has not been 
in session to comply with the terms of this act, the governor, acting for the State or

INCREASING SCOPE OF THE LAND-GRANT COLLEGES. 
Extension work. 
he movement for agricultural education in this country received 
initial impulse from the establishment of land-grant colleges 
der the congressional act of July 2, 1862, and naturally under the  
-P-A-G-E-274

   increasing demand for this particular form of education these original 
centers of the work are extending their activities. In particular, 
should be noted the various forms of extension work for which pro: 
vision is being made under the auspices of the colleges, and th 
establishment by them of post-graduate courses with the sanctio 
of a special diploma. 
The extension work of the agricultural colleges was placed on 
solid basis by the action of the Association of American Agricultural 
Colleges and Experiment Stations, taken at the twenty-third annual 
conference which was held at Portland, Oreg., in August, 1909. O: 
that occasion the association, by an amendment to the constitution| 
created a third section, the section on extension work, and placed ij 
on equal footing with the two sections previously existing. 
The committee on extension work again recommended that ther 
be organized in each land-grant college a thoroughly equippe 
department for extension work conducted according to the followin; 
plan: 
(1) That every land-grant college appoint a director of extension work who shaj 
give all his time to this line of endeavor. 
(2) That sufficient salary be paid to secure a man who is well equipped for the plac: 
and that he be given substantial funds at the outset. 
(3) That, whenever possible, he be given assistants, either one or more men w! 
can give all of their time to extension work and act as ‘‘field agents,”’ or have at 
disposal the partial time of men who are connected with the college or station sta: 
(4) That the first work to be done should be that of organizing those methods 
extension work which are already in vogue at the college. Nearly all the colleg| 
have large correspondence with farmers, send out publications which are in the natu] 
of monographs on practical subjects, give lectures before granges and other los 
organizations, and hold demonstrations. We would advise that all of this work 
unified and put, so far as the administration is concerned, into the hands of the direc 
of extension work. It may be desirable temporarily to have even the short win’ 
and summer courses offered by the institution placed under the same manageme! 
although, strictly speaking, these enterprises are not extension work. It is excet 
ingly important that men assigned chiefly to extension teaching, while immediat 
responsible to the director of that work, shall also have equally close connections 
those teaching departments of the institution in which their special subject natura! 
lies. 
(5) We would then go so far as to suggest that those activities of the experiment s| 
tion which are not primarily connected with research or experimentation, but whi 
are really designed to give popular dissemination to general agricultural informati 
and which so burden the time and energy of most of our station workers, shoul 
rapidly as possible be given over to the general direction of the director of extens' 
work. 
(6) Finally, and most important of all, we would urge upon the director of exten: 
work and the administration of the institution the prime necessity of getting into 
public mind a thorough understanding of what extension work is. It is not a sch 
to advertise the college. It is not a plan to trap students for the college, or even to 
boys and girls interested in agricultural schools and colleges generally. It is fu: 
mentally a means of teaching the people out of school about agriculture and cou: 
life in all its phases. It is an educational proposition. Its aim should be to r 
every farmer and his family.

      And further, in order to provide more liberally for extension work 
in rural communities, the committee recommended a national appro- 
priation for the following purposes: 
(1) Appropriate $10,000 a year from the National Treasury to each State and Terri- 
tory, for extension work in agriculture and rural life. 
(2) Provide that at any time, after two years have elapsed from the date any State 
x Territory has accepted this appropriation and has actually organized extension 
ork in connection with its land-grant college, there shall be available from the Na- 
ional Treasury, in addition to the amount named above, an amount of money, for 
ach State and Territory, for the same purpose, equal to the amount appropriated by 
e legislature of the State or Territory for this purpose; provided that the additional 
)ppropriation to any State or Territory shall not exceed an amount equal to 1 cent 
er capita of the total population of that State or Territory as shown by the last United 
‘tates census. 
(3) This appropriation should be given specifically to the land-grant colleges and 
nly to them. 
(4) Require each college to organize a “‘department” or ‘‘division” or ‘‘school” of 
xtension work, i. e., to organize the work as a definite part of the institution. 
(5) Confine the work for the present to agriculture, domestic science, and other 
hases of rural life. 
(6) Define extension work broadly and yet closely. Define agriculture and rural 
iife so as to include instruction and aid in any phase of this field—in subjects technical 
ind scientific, concerning business management, home making, sanitation; and eco- 
omic, social, and moral subjects. Indicate that extension work is for adults and 
outh and children, and for people in towns and cities as well as in the open country. 
These provisions are practically embodied in the Dolliver bill re- 
orted to the Senate June 22, 1910. 
The American Association of Farmers’ Institute Workers, which 
eld its fourteenth annual meeting at Portland, Oreg., also during 
e month of August, 1909, adopted the report of its committee on 
ovable schools of agriculture, and indorsed this work as one ‘‘that 
ill at a minimum cost carry to a great number of people a sys- 
matic, thorough, and definite knowledge concerning the different 
ranches of agriculture.” 
The importance of the agricultural colleges as coordinating and 
irective centers for the various grades of agricultural education 
hich are developing in the several States, is emphasized by the act 
the Virginia legislature, approved March 17, 1910. This act pro- 
des for a united agricultural board coordinating the agricultural 
stitutions and agencies for the betterment of agricultural, experi- 
ental, and demonstration work, and to advance generally the agri- 
ltural interests of the State. 
The board is composed of the governor, the state superintendent of 
blic instruction, the commissioner of agriculture, two members of 
e state board of agriculture, the president of the Virginia College 
Agriculture and Polytechnic Institute, the director of the Virginia 
icultural Experiment Station, and one member of the board of 
itors of those institutions, supervisor of the district experiment

stations, general director of demonstration work of United States 
Department of Agriculture, and the Virginia director of demonstra 
tion work of the United States Department of Agriculture. 
Under such rules and regulations as it may prescribe, the boar 
will assign to the Virginia College of Agriculture and Polytechni 
Institute the adult demonstration work and movable schools an 
other like agencies when established; to the Virginia Agricultura) 
Experiment Station the establishment and direction of the local o: 
district experiment stations; to the state board of education th 
experimental and demonstrative work in connection with the publi 
schools of the State; and to the commissioner and state board of agrij 
culture the direction and management of the farmers’ institute: 
To carry out the provisions of the act, the state board of educatio 
is directed to appropriate $5,000 annually after March 1, 1910, an 
$15,000 will be paid out of the state treasury. 
Georgia State College of Agriculture has now $14,000 a ye: 
available for the department of extension work. Five men gi 
their entire time to this service, which is organized under the char, 
of J. E. Hite, M. S., director of agricultural extension. Fourtee 
movable schools of agriculture were held in April and May, 1910, wi 
an average attendance of ninety. These schools were of three day: 
duration, but in the future will be six days each. 
The regents of the University of Idaho have made provision f 
three field men to devote their entire time during the spring, summ: 
and autumn months to work among the farmers, fruit growers, ai 
dairymen of the State. These men will conduct neighborhood me 
ings, farmers’ institutes, and short courses in practical agricult 
and will give advice and conduct demonstrations in their vario' 
lines of work. One of these field men will be an expert in hor 
culture and entomology, the second will be an expert dairyman, ai 
the third will be an expert soil and crop man and irrigationi 
Another work to be established during the coming winter (1910-1 
is the movable school of agriculture. The plan provides for a ti 
weeks’ course to be given in different localities of the State by ei: 
or ten of the most expert and practical men on the various subjects 
interest to farmers. In order to secure a movable school of a: 
culture in any locality it will be necessary for at least 150 farmers 
sign a petition asking for a school and pledge their attenda: 
thereat, together with the payment of a $2 fee to aid in cover 
expenses of the course and to provide a suitable hall or building w 
heat and light. 
Under the auspices of the agricultural extension department of 
University of Illinois a conference on the teaching of agriculture in 
common schools of the State was held at the university March 24—

AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 269 
States, representatives of railroads, farmers’ institute officials, 
members of the legislature, and others interested in agricultural 
education were in attendance. The need of a course of study in 
agriculture for the elementary schools of the State was discussed at 
length by different members in the conference, and upon motion a 
committee was appointed to outline a course for the elementary 
schools. The value of model rural school equipments in agriculture, 
domestic science, and hygiene and public health was discussed, and 
it was decided that such equipments should be assembled at the 
university. An equipment in manual training has been provided. 
The following resolution was adopted by the conference:     
                                                              
     
    
   
   That this conference appoint a committee of three to enter into communication with 
the Illinois Farmers’ Institute, through its committee on agricultural education in the 
public schools, to bring to its attention the urgent necessity of furnishing to the teachers 
of the elementary schools of the State all possible aid in the organization and adapta- 
tion of agricultural materials suitable to the purposes of these schools, and, further, to 
request that they take such action as they deem necessary to secure at the next session 
of the legislature ample funds to equip the University of Illinois, through its college 
of agriculture and school of education, to carry on the following most essential lines 
of work: 
(1) Research in the organization and method of nature study and agriculture in the 
elementary schools. 
(2) The training of specialists within this field. 
(3) The publication of abundant literature for the use of the public schools. 
(4) The maintenance of a correspondence bureau to meet the rapidly growing 
demands from the teachers and elementary school interests of the State. 
(5) The establishment and maintenance of a bureau for the preparation and dis- 
tribution of equipment and materials essential to instruction in this subject. 
(6) The employment of thoroughly competent demonstration teachers who shall be 
sent out into the State to assist in the introduction of this study in the elementary 
schools. 
(7) Such other means of advancing this study as may later appear to be desirable. 
It was voted that a second meeting be held next year in connection 
with the agricultural short course at the University of Illinois, and the 
following standing committee was appointed to continue the organi- 
zation and work of the conference: Chairman, U. J. Hoffman, 
assistant state superintendent of schools, Springfield, Tl.; Anna L. 
[Barbre, county superintendent of schools, Taylorville; Charles H. 
Watts, county superintendent of schools, Champaign; Hon. J. B. 
urrows, Decatur; Mrs. Scott Durand, Lake Bluff; Alice Jean Pat- 
terson, State Normal University, Normal; Prof. W. C. Bagley, Uni- 
ersity of Illinois; Prof. Fred L. Charles, University of Illinois. 
Mr. Edwin Lee Holton has been elected to the position of professor 
f industrial education for the extension department of the Kansas 
tate Agricultural College. Professor Holton will have charge of the 
troduction of agriculture, shop work, and home economics into 
ral, graded, and high schools of the State, and will also have charge

of the corn contests, the boys’ corn clubs, and new correspondence 
courses relating to these subjects. 
The Massachusetts Agricultural College gave a two weeks’ course 
in rural sociology and general rural problems to country ministers at 
the summer school held at the college for the third time in 1910. 
The Michigan Agricultural College held a one week’s school for 
ministers the past summer. 
Minnesota University has appointed E. C. Huntington chief editor 
of publications in the agricultural-extension and home-education 
courses. In addition to editing and presenting in popular form the 
various publications of the college, it is planned to devise an elemen- 
tary course in agriculture and a correspondence course and to arrange 
for short lectures and demonstrations. The university has estab- 
lished twelve demonstration farms of 80 acres each and plans to 
establish 7 more. 
The college of agriculture of the University of Missouri conducted 
a night school at Kansas City during the past winter. The school 
was held at the Central High School hall, and the course consisted of 
lectures, one each, by the heads of the departments in the college of 
agriculture. The college furnished the lecturers for a similar school 
held in the Young Men’s Christian Association building at St. Louis, 
by the Frisco Railroad. 
Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College has established, by 
direction of the state legislature, a chair of agriculture for schools. 
T. M. Jeffords occupies the chair. His duties are “to direct and 
advise in all matters relating to the teaching of agriculture and allied 
subjects in the common schools * * *. He shall visit schools, 
the teachers’ institutes, the summer normal schools, and the state 
normal schools, advise with the teachers and officers concerned 
* * *. He shall prepare, print, and distribute such leaflets and| 
other literature as may be helpful to teachers.” 
Ohio State University, at Columbus, has increased its extension| 
work to include movable schools of agriculture to be known as “agri- 
cultural extension schoools.” Thirty-four such schools were hel 
during the past year, each one week in duration. They were attende 
by nearly five thousand persons. 
The board of trustees of Clemson Agricultural College, S. C., a 
their meeting in September, 1909, voted to establish a division o 
extension work and farmers’ institutes; the men of the division t 
do no teaching in the college, but to devote their whole time t 
helping the farmers and others of the State. As constituted, the fore 
of the division consists of a superintendent, an assistant in dair 
husbandry, an assistant in rural school agriculture, and an assistan 
in animal husbandry. To this number will be added an assistant i 
drainage engineering. The men of this division work in two way:

    First, they form the basis of a permanent institute corps to hold 
institutes at such times as the farmers of the State are at leisure to 
attend. Second, each one of these men selects a few farmers in 
different parts of the State, interested in his special line of work, 
who are visited regularly and to whom he gives expert advice. An 
accurate account of all operations and results is kept and will be 
published in bulletin form for the benefit of other farmers. The 
assistant in rural school agriculture will encourage the teaching of 
this subject in the rural schools. To this end he will select a few 
schools, and visit them regularly, and instruct classes. He will 
also meet the teachers in their various organizations and instruct 
them in teaching agriculture. A correspondence course in agri- 
culture, designed primarily for the benefit of rural-school teachers, is 
also to be established. This will be followed later by a number of 
short courses to be given at the college. Once a year during the sum- 
mer a state institute or farmers’ congress, to last three or four days, 
will be held at the college. 
GRADUATE COURSES OF INSTRUCTION IN AGRICULTURE. 
The fourth session of the graduate school of agriculture, under the 
auspices of the Association of American Agricultural Colleges and 
Experiment Stations, was held at the Iowa State College, Ames, 
Iowa, July 4-29, 1910. The programme offered advanced courses in 
plant physiology and pathology, agronomy, horticulture, animal 
husbandry, rural economics, dairying, poultry, and rural engineering, 
given by a faculty of fifty-three men selected from the specialists in 
the agricultural colleges, experiment stations, and department of 
agriculture, together with specialists from Harvard University, 
University of Pennsylvania, Carnegie Institution at Washington, 
D. C., Ontario Agricultural College, the Royal Imperial Agricultural 
College of Vienna, and the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. 
The principal subject discussed in the evening sessions and the Satur- 
day conferences was extension work. Considerable interest was 
manifested in this work. The school is in the immediate charge of 
a committee on graduate study of the association. The first session 
of the school was held at Ohio State University in 1902, the second 
at the University of Ilinois in 1906, and the third at Cornell University 
in 1908. Dr. A.C. True, director of the Office of Experiment Stations, 
nited States Department of Agriculture, is dean of the school. 
In response to a prevalent demand, graduate courses of instruc- 
ion have been established in many of the agricultural and mechan- 
ical colleges. Forty-three of these institutions are now offering 
dvanced courses in this subject leading to the master’s degree in
-P-A-G-E-280
272 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
science, ten to the degree of doctor of philosophy or doctor of science. 
The University of Nebraska has a five-year course in forestry lead- 
ing to the degree of master of forestry. The Audubon sugar school 
of the Louisiana State University offers a five-year collegiate course 
in the sugar industry, of which the last two years constitute a pro-_ 
fessional course, open to graduate students of any institution who 
may be prepared to take, advantageously, the work offered. 
          
   
                
     
    
    
    
    
   
       MOVEMENTS IN OTHER COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 
A noticeable feature of this general movement is the endeavor on 
the part of colleges and universities other than those endowed by the 
congressional land grant, to make provision for instruction in agri- 
culture. 
Columbia University, New York; has for some time manifested an 
interest in this subject by giving credit for work in agriculture done 
at Cornell University to candidates for the teacher’s diploma. The 
lecture on an agricultural subject, given before the university by 
Prof. G. T. Powers, January 19 of the present year, opened a series 
of lectures on economic agriculture by various specialists. These 
lectures are related to plans, which are already under consideration 
by the department of applied science, for the organization of some 
form of school or department of agriculture in connection with the 
university. It is reported that several important donations have 
already been received for this work. 
The trustees and administrators of Syracuse University, Syracuse, 
N. Y., have decided to establish definite courses in agriculture and 
forestry as a preliminary step with the purpose in view of organizin, 
soon a college of agriculture. Provision is made for utilizing th 
present facilities of the university in offering students, beginning i 
September, 1910, the opportunity of electing courses leading t 
specialization in agriculture and forestry. Temporarily, the organiza 
tion will be under the direction of Prof. W. L. Bray, of the botan, 
department. 
Miami University, at Oxford, Ohio, has established a departmen 
of agricultural education intended especially for teachers, and durin, 
the past summer maintained a short course in the subject for thi 
benefit of teachers, as did also Baylor University at Waco, Tex., an 
the University of Texas. 
At Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, Pa., an agricultural conferen 
was held April 16 last, to consider the opportunities open to wome 
for earning a livelihood in general farming, truck gardening, stoc 
raising, poultry raising, fruit-tree nurseries, hothouse floricultur 
bee keeping, and landscape gardening.

     AUXILIARY AGENCIES FOR TH?: ADVANCEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL 
ED'JCATION. 
The survey of the present movement respecting agricultural educa- 
tion as a means of the general uplift of rural life in this country 
would be incomplete without reference to many efforts in this direc- 
tion apart from legislative measures and the work of organized 
institutions, but, nevertheiess, of great importance as promoters of 
public sentiment and support for the movement. 
The scope and force of these efforts are illustrated by the following 
statements: 
A conference of agricultural educators and rural social workers was 
held at the Massachusetts Agricultural College, August 9-12, 1910. 
The purpose of the meeting was to bring together for cooperation 
such organizations as undertake some of the various phases of social 
work in rural communities. The programme included addresses and 
discussions on the work of the following agencies: Rural playgrounds, 
the rural library, the rural church, the rural school, the agricultural 
high school, the country Young Men’s Christian Association, and the 
grange. Representatives of all of these organizations were present 
and, in addition to the general sessions of the conference, sectional 
meetings were held by the various organizations. At the meeting 
lof the Rural Ministers’ Association a definite plan of social work was 
ormulated for the coming year, to be reported upon at the next 
onference. At the meeting of the rural teachers a permanent 
ssociation of teachers of elementary agriculture was formed, having 
or its object the encouragement of the organization of boys and 
irls’ agricultural clubs and the introduction of agriculture and school 
ardening into the elementary schools. This is the third conference 
eld under the auspices of the Massachusetts Agricultural College. 
he following extract from resolutions adopted by the ministers is

By the will of Mrs. Harriet Faunce, who died in April, 1909, an 
state consisting of a farm of 60 acres on which are located two 
ouses, a barn, and greenhouse, and a fund of $20,000, was placed in 
lhe hands of four trustees to be used for the benefit of the farmers of 
andwich, Mass., and for the encouragement of agriculture on the 
ape Cod peninsula. The trustees, acting under the advice of the 
assachusetts Agricultural College, have decided to use the property 
a demonstration farm. Albert W. Doolittle has been selected as

     superintendent, and an advisory council has been appointed fro: 
the faculty of the Massachusetts Agricultural College. The super: 
intendent plans to demonstrate the possibilities in poultry, vegetable 
and fruit farming on Cape Cod. In addition to managing the farm, 
he will visit neighboring farms when requested, to give expert advic 
upon farm problems. The farm will cooperate with the to 
schools. A course of agriculture has been introduced this year inti 
the public high school of Sandwich, and the farm will cooperate wit! 
the school, the boys taking the course will be given practical work 
in connection with their school work, on the Faunce farm. It i 
also planned to give regular employment to a few boys who desir 
practical farm work under expert supervision. 
The Michigan Society for the Promotion of Agricultural Educatio 
in the Public Schools was organized January 22, 1910. The pw 
pose of the society is to discuss methods of coer agriculture i 
the public schools, especially in the high schools, and to advane 
the cause of school agriculture. Two meetings were held durin: 
the year 1909-10. The officers of the association are as follow: 
President, R. G. Carr, North Adams; vice-president, R. G. Hoopi 
garner, Otsego; treasurer, B. H. Roberts, Hudson; secretary, C. 
Nash, Lawton. 
The Nebraska department of public instruction has issued a ge 
eral outline of plans. (1910) for the home experiment department 
the Nebraska Boys and Girls Club. By way of explanation it sa; 
that the ‘‘plan is to provide some definite work for a number 
young people in each county in which they are to receive instructi 
and on which they are to report progress each month.’’ The wo 
is to be done in cooperation with the county superintendent 
schools and will be put upon an educational basis. The membe 
will be divided into two classes, those from 16 to 21 years and tho 
under 16 years. The home work outlined for boys includes an ac; 
corn test, an ear to row test, and tests in husking and judging cor 
also an acre potatoes contest, and size of seed piece test. In dom 
tic science the work planned includes cookery, butter making, sewi 
and sweet-pea culture. Each person becoming a member of t' 
club is expected to carry out fully the directions furnished by t! 
department and to make reports at stated intervals. There will 
contests for the individual counties and a final state contest. 
During the month of April, 1910, a charter was granted by t 
State of Tennessee to the ‘‘Folk School and Rural Life Societ; 
The purpose of this organization, as specified in the charter, is ‘‘t 
establishment and maintenance of schools for the education a: 
instruction of men and women of 18 years of age and over in 
elementary principles of the arts and sciences necessary to go 
citizenship and to industrial, economic, and social efficiency and

          practical application of them to rural life in the Southern States.” 
The charter members of the board are as follows: Prof. P. P. Claxton, 
University of Tennessee; S. A. Mynders, superintendent of schools, 
Knoxville; Fred B. Frazier, elementary school inspector for Tennes- 
see; R. L. Jones, state superintendent of public instruction of Ten- 
nessee; and John R. Neal, Spring City, member of the upper house 
of the legislature. 
A communication from Professor Claxton, dated May 26, 1910, 
says: ‘‘We have organized a board of trustees and will probably 
extend this into a larger society for the purpose of establishing and 
maintaining one or more schools in Tennessee and other Southern 
States organized somewhat on the plan of the folk high schools of 
the Scandinavian countries.” 
The office of state supervisor of elementary rural schools is main- 
tained jointly by the Peabody education fund and the southern edu- 
ation board and has been created in the following States: Virginia, 
est Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, 
ouisiana, and Tennessee. The purpose of the office is to aid in 
he development of a state system of elementary rural schools in the 
outhern States. The position is filled by thestate board of education, 
pon recommendation of the superintendent of public instruction. 
r. R. H. Powell, jr., formerly editor of School and Home, Atlanta, 
a., during the spring (1910) was elected to the position for the 
tate of Georgia; Principal William K. Tate, Memminger High School, 
harleston, S. C., was elected for South Carolina; Fred B. Frazier, 
ounty superintendent of public schools, Rhea County, Tenn., was 
lected for Tennessee; and Principal L. J. Hanifan, Charleston High 
chool, West Virginia, was elected to the position July 1, 1910, for 
est Virginia. 2 
Railroads through the agricultural sections of the United States 
ave adopted various methods for encouraging agriculture and of 
troducing improved agricultural methods along their lines. A 
cent policy adopted by the St. Louis and San Francisco, the Atchi- 
mn, Topeka, and Santa Fe, and the Wabash railroads in the State 
f Missouri is of wide significance in respect to the direct benefits 
at may accrue to agricultural production. These roads now offer 
number of scholarships for the short winter course of agriculture at 
e University of Missouri. 
An “‘announcement”’ from the St. Louis and San Francisco Rail- 
ad states that the corporation offers forty-five agricultural scholar- 
ips of $100 each for the winter of 1910-11, one scholarship for each 
the forty-five counties of the State of Missouri through which the 
ad extends. ‘‘They will be awarded to the man or boy 16 years 
age or over who grows and exhibits the best ten ears of corn in 
is county this year.” A county corn show will be held in each of

At the end of the short winter course of agriculture at the universit; 
the dean will nominate a student from each of the eighteen countie 
“who, having creditably taken the full seven weeks’ course, make: 
the best progress, and that student will be mailed a check for $5 
by the Wabash Railroad Company.” 
A communication from the University of Missouri dated May 24 
1910, states that the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad no 
offers eighteen agricultural scholarships of $50 each for the winte 
term of agriculture at the university. 
The Pennsylvania Railroad has purchased a run-down farm of 5 
acres at Bacon, Del., which it will renovate as a demonstration far 
H. S. Lippincott, a graduate of the college of agriculture of Corne 
University, has been appointed superintendent. The New Yor 
Central and Hudson River Railroad will operate three large farm] 
in different sections of the State of New York. The farms will b 
run as demonstration farms, using no methods that are not availabl 
to neighboring farmers. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Wester: 
Railroad has similar plans. Announcement is made that the Gre 
Northern Railway will institute a series of farm experiments in co. 
junction with various development and commercial clubs in t 
towns along its line. 
Many of the agricultural colleges in cooperation with the railroa 
of their States have equipped and sent out ‘‘better farming”’ speci 
trains. Maryland Agricultural College has purchased a car and h 
it fitted as a permanent part of its equipment. Massachusetts A: 
cultural College, in addition to a special train sent out over t! 
steam roads, equipped a ‘‘better farming” special of trolley cai 
which covered 200 miles of trolley roads and reached points n 
easily accessible by the steam roads. In Wisconsin, Principal F. 
Crane, of the Dunn County School of Agriculture, with Prof. R. 
Moore and H. L. Webster, of the college of agriculture of the Univ 
sity of Wisconsin, have substituted an automobile for the us 
“better farming” train. During the last week in August, 1910, t 
automobile with a corps of lecturers traveled about Dunn Coun 
holding farmers’ meetings.

ers’ reading circle, and is read by the rural school teachers throughout the State. 
Perhaps the best, most systematic, and effective effort to establish courses and instruc- 
tion in agriculture has been made in the high schools. It is a matter of great satis- 
faction to see how these courses have been installed, how they are being offered by 
competent teachers, and how young men and women are eagerly seeking instruction 
in the classes.” (Twenty-seventh Biennial Report, Superintendent of Public In- 
struction, 1908, p. 90.) 
Indiana.—A regular course of agriculture has been adopted for the high schools of 
Hendricks County and is taught in the majority of the schools. Agriculture is taught 
in three high schools in Hamilton County. 
Kansas.—The introduction of elementary agriculture and domestic science into 
our schools is proceeding at a very encouraging rate. Regular courses in both sub- 
jects are maintained in certain of our county high schools and in a few of the city

CHAPTER V. 
EDUCATION IN PORTO RICO. 
The Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1909 presented 
a review of education in Porto Rico covering the decade 1899-1908.¢ 
The vigor with which the work of public education has been carried 
on since the island came under the control of the United States is 
indicated by a comparison of the statistics for successive years. 
From the school census taken on the 1st day of March, for each of the 
three years 1907 to 1909, it appears that during that period the num- 
ber of pupils in the secondary schools increased 87 per cent, in the 
common schools 60 per cent, and in the special schools 40 per cent, 
or an average increase for all the public schools of 59 per cent. 
The following statements relative to the scholastic year ending 
September, 1909, are from the report of Hon. E. G. Dexter, commis- 
sioner of education for Porto Rico.

The system of education to which the above statistics pertain is 
egulated by the organic act for Porto Rico, the Foraker Act, 
hich was passed by the Congress of the United States April 12, 
900, and went into effect May 1 of the same year. The act provides 
section 25)— 
That the commissioner of education shall superintend public instruction throughout 
orto Rico, and all disbursements on account thereof must be approved by him, and 
le shall perform such other duties as may be prescribed by law, and make such 
ports through the governor as may be required by the Commissioner of Education of 
e United States, which shall annually be transmitted to Congress. 
The commissioner of education, who is appointed for a term of 
ur years by the President of the United States, has entire control 
public education, including the power of appointing all subordi- 
tes in the department, with the exception of certain classes of 
achers to be presently named. The commissioner of education is 
isted by an assistant commissioner, a secretary, three general 
perintendents of schools, and thirty-five supervising principals 
ch assigned to a particular district of the island. There is also a 
ief of the division of property and accounts and a chief of the 
vision of school-board accounts. 
For local administration the island is divided into 66 units, known 
municipalities. Within each of these divisions a school board is 
cted, which is charged with the care and maintenance of school 
perty and, subject to the approval of the commissioner of educa- 
n, with the appointment of teachers, the general management of 
le schools, and the application of the school funds. 
In accordance with the provisions of the organic act an endeavor 
s been made to classify the schools with special reference to local 
ditions. The classes are as follows: 
irst. Preparatory schools, intended to provide ‘‘elementary instruction at a less 
nse than that of the rural and graded schools, and as a means for the training of 
thers for the rural schools. The curriculum is in all instances that of the first 
le.” 
econd. Rural schools, which form the most numerous group within the island, 
were originally restricted to the first three grades, or years, of the school course; 
tly a fourth year has been added to a large number of these schools. 
‘ird: Graded schools. ‘‘These are all situated within the larger centers of popu- 
n—perhaps 100 such centers in all. The schools are carefully graded on a basis 
less advanced than that of the better school systems in the United States. The 
em extends through the full 8 grades in 28 towns in the island and through 7 
es in 43.”

    282 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
Following the school classification, the teachers of the island ai 
First. Preparatory teachers (limited by law to 100 in number). These are requi 
to be unmarried persons of less than 22 years, who teach ungraded rural schools an: 
are at the same time under instruction by some person specially appointed by th 
commissioner as instructor of preparatory teachers. These teachers receive a sala 
of $20 per month, without allowance for house rent. 
Second. Rural teachers. These are in charge of ungraded schools in the 
districts, and receive a salary of $35 per month, with an allowance for house rent 
from $3 to $8 monthly. 
Third. Graded teachers. This class is divided as follows: Graded teachers teachi 
in Spanish and English graded schools. All are employed in the graded-sch: 
system of the various municipalities. Those teaching in Spanish receive a salary 
$60, with an allowance for house rent of from $7 to $15 monthly. English grad 
teachers receive in salary $5 per month more. 
The following additional classes of teachers are appointed direct! 
by the commissioner of education: 
First. Teachers of English. These are nearly all Americans, serving either 
special teachers of English in the school system of the smaller municipalities or 
grade teachers giving instruction in English. The salary is $75 per month, witho} 
allowance for house rent. 
Second. Special teachers, such as teachers of music, art, manual training, domes' 
science, agriculture, and kindergarten teachers. The salary is the same as for teach: 
of English. 
Third. High-school teachers. Teachers of this class are at present only in 8 muni 
palities of the island. They receive salaries varying from $675 to $1,500 per annu: 
The control of the central administration over the whole work 
facilitated by the division of the island into 35 districts, each un 
one of the supervising principals already mentioned. These distri 
are constituted as follows: 
First. Municipalities having more than 100 schools. 
Second. Municipalities having between 50 and 99 schools. 
Third. Municipalities, or groups of municipalities, containing less than 50 sch 
The importance of art and industrial training has been recogni 
by the appointment of special teachers of music and drawing in 
larger school systems, and by plans for the introduction of cooki 
and sewing for the girls and wood and iron work for the boys in 
larger municipalities. The disposition of the Porto Rican gove: 
ment to encourage talent is indicated by the establishment of— 
a system of scholarships by means of which a bright pupil in the rural schools 
be carried entirely at government expense until graduation from the best coll: 
and universities in the United States. By a law recently passed the school bo: 
may devote an amount of money, not to exceed 5 per cent of their annual budge 
provide scholarships for the pupils in the graded schools of the municipality. Us; 
such scholarships the pupil may complete the eighth grade. There are then 
to him scholarships (100) at a monthly value of $12 each in the high schools of 
island, or, if his inclination leads him in another direction, scholarships (75) at 
annual value of $200 in the normal department or (40) in the agricultural depart: 
of the University of Porto Rico. Having completed the four years’ high-scl 
course, or the four years’ normal course, there are available 39 scholarships at a v;

of $500 each for colleges and universities of the United States. There are, moreover, 
20 scholarships of an annual value of $250 each for such institutions as Tuskegee and 
Hampton. These are open to students of the higher grades of the graded schools. 
       
     
       
       
    
    
      
       
      
        
    
     The judicious manner in which the entire work has been developed 
iis indicated by the fact that— 
There are but three fully organized high schools with four-year courses at present 
iin the island. These are situated at San Juan, Ponce, and Mayaguez, and in each 
here is a commercial department in addition to the regular classical and scientific 
ourses. They have courses equivalent to the moderately well-equipped high schools 
f the United States, and their graduates may enter nearly 50 American colleges or 
iversities on certificate. In addition there has been organized during the present 
ear the first-year high-school course in three other municipalities of the island. 
The general plan of classification carefully worked out for this 
land system has made it possible to maintain a fairly high standard 
f elementary education in the more compact communities; to meet 
jhe crude conditions of the rural communities; and to provide for 
entral supervision while, at the same time, the capacity for local 
chool. control is encouraged. As carried into effect, it furnishes an 
dex to the actual advancement of the children of Porto Rico in the 
ifferent classes of schools. For instance, it appears that the enroll- 
ent in graded schools, which in 1907 was 22,870 pupils, reached a 
tal in 1909 of 32,547, being an increase of 42 per cent; the enroll- 
ent in rural and preparatory schools during the same time increased 
om. 28,934 to 50,107, or 73 per cent. 
The classification of pupils, by grades, was as follows:

ven more significant than the above statistics are the figures 
wing the progress in instruction in the English language. In 
6-7 there were 202 schools in the island taught wholly in English. 
1909 this number had increased to 442, being 28 per cent of all the 
mentary schools. The number taught partly in English increased 
‘ing the same time from 187 to 247. There remained in the last 
r 717 schools taught wholly in Spanish, but in 163 of these 
lish was taken as a special subject.  
-P-A-G-E-292
    284 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
The analysis of enrollment, on the basis of grade, assists materially 
in the development of the school curriculum. For example, the 
progress of pupils in the rural schools, in which at first only the most 
elementary work was attempted, has already led to the formulation 
by the department of a six-year course for rural schools, closely 
articulated with that of the graded schools. 
Among recent measures adopted for the general improvement o 
the public schools are: Flexible promotion, which requires that th 
course of study be outlined by terms, half-terms, and quarters; th 
introduction of a school savings bank system; and the establishmen: 
of school libraries and of public school playgrounds. The school say- 
ings banks, introduced in 1909, have had remarkable success. The 
were reported in 265 schools, with 6,937 depositors, and a tota 
deposit of $6,763. 
Interest in public school playgrounds was specially stimulated b: 
the visit and personal efforts of Dr. Henry S. Curtis, former secre 
tary of the Playground Association of America. As a result of th 
interest thus awakened, whereas at the beginning of the school yea 
1908-9 there was but one playground in the island, by the end 
1909 27 towns had made special provision and in 39 other to 
definite steps had been taken for such provision of playgrounds. 
As a result’ of special efforts made during the year the librar 
facilities of the island have been greatly increased. On this subje 
the commissioner says: 
     
        
   
      
   
      
   
     
     
      
    
    
   
    
    
    
    
   
      
       There were at the opening of the school year libraries in 10 towns. In several 
these, books were not in use or were only for teachers’ reference. In addition 
towns had libraries open to the public, but the books had been chosen mainly fj 
older readers, and little if any attempt had been made to provide books of especij 
interest to children. Libraries in rural schools were unknown. 
# * * * * * * 
Other than school libraries, there are now 20 libraries in 18 towns, containi 
total of 28,675 volumes with a reported cost of $8,314 for maintenance. The larg 
of these is the Insular Library, located in San Juan, originally established by t 
department and now maintained by the insular government. It contains 8,650 bo 
and costs $4,480 annually for maintenance. 
Through the courtesy of periodicals in the United States, attention was called to t! 
need of the schools of the island, while the steamship companies offered to trai 
port free of charge all books donated for the purpose. This met with a response] 
over 4,000 books and magazines. Mr. A. F. Estabrook, of Boston, again showed 
interest by a liberal cash contribution. ¥ 
It was felt that the most urgent need for these libraries was in the rural scho 
especially in the mountain barrios, where, because of the difficulties of travel, ¢ 
dren seldom go beyond their neighborhood, and have no access to books other 
the elementary text-books used in the schools. Boxes, holding about 50 books e: 
and of a size suitable for transportation on horseback over the rough trails, were s| 
out the latter part of the year and were well received. It is my intention to hi 
these boxes of books transferred from school to school until all have access to thi 
Of course, the majority of the books are in English, which necessarily limits 
usefulness at present, but with the increase in English instruction this limitation

   disappear and the library will rather become an incentive to the study of English. 
The educational value of pictures was recognized by including available illustrated 
magazines. At present there are 57 rural libraries, containing 2,891 volumes, in 
operation. 
Supervising principals were urged to encourage the establishment or extension of 
libraries in the graded schools of their respective districts. The interest aroused on 
the part of both pupils and patrons has been gratifying. Books have been sent by the 
department and donated by individuals, with the result that 24 libraries, containing 
6,147 books, and at a cost of $441 for maintenance, are now in operation in graded 
schools. These are open daily from two to seven hours and have a reported attendance 
of from 500 to 600. In most cases these libraries are located in the school building, 
under the charge of a teacher as librarian, and furnish convenient meeting places for 
evening study, better lighted and equipped than the majority of homes. Already 
results are seen in improved school work, while no comment is necessary as to the 
value of this means of keeping children off the streets at night. 
To sum up, there are, altogether, in the island 100 libraries with a total of 37,713 
books to which the public has access; and of these, 81 with 9,038 books are in either 
graded or rural schools. 
TEACHERS’ MEETINGS AND INSTITUTES. 
Throughout the year the importance of general teachers’ meetings has been recog- 
nized by the department, and in each of the 35 districts of the island such assemblies 
have been conducted by the supervising principals. Whenever possible some one 
of the general superintendents or other member of the department has been present 
and taken part in the discussions. 
The importance of such meetings can hardly be overestimated. In many instances 
the teachers have had little or no opportunity for special pedagogical preparation 
before entering the profession, and the inspiration gained through such discussions 
shows plainly in their work the precise character of the meetings. Their frequency 
has been left largely to the supervising principals of the various districts. 
The celebration of school holidays recognized by law has become 
an interesting feature of the educational work, as is indicated by 
the following accounts of such celebrations by the supervising 
principals of the districts, which were quoted by the commissioner: 
Corozal district—‘‘Arbor Day and Thanksgiving Day were celebrated together, as 
is the custom, by appropriate exercises held partly in front of the school buildings 
(graded) and partly in the plazas of the several towns of the districts. The exercises 
consisted of speaking and singing in both English and Spanish. Several trees and 
shrubs were planted. The significance of Thanksgiving Day, both historically and 
morally, was not left in the background, as is often the case when the two holidays are 
celebrated together. 
“On the 24th of December ihe significance of Christmas was explained to the 
upils, and in the afternoon several of the teachers distributed gifts to their pupils. 
“Tincoln’s Birthday was celebrated with great enthusiasm throughout the district. 
‘he great statesman has a warm place in the hearts of these people and they are not 
ackward in showing it. The commissioner’s address, written especially for this occa- 
‘ion, was read in all schools, and the booklet on Lincoln sent out by the department 
as used to good advantage in furnishing valuable material for the exercises. Differ- 
mt phases of the emancipator’s life were discussed in original papers in both languages 
y several of the older pupils of the graded schools. The exercises were favorably 
ived by good-sized audiences of parents and friends of the pupils.
-P-A-G-E-294
  286 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910, 
‘‘Washington’s Birthday was appropriately observed in all schools. A great deal of 
attention was paid to the musical part of the programme. Illustrated acrostics and 
famous quotations of the ‘Father of his country’ served to vary the usual order of 
exercises. 
“Memorial Day was celebrated by a union field day and picnic of the graded schools 
of the three towns in the districts. Several rural schools attended and representatives 
of many others were present. The exercises were held on grounds very suitably 
located, being very centrally located among the towns. The people in general were 
very much interested in the affair and attended in large numbers. Most of the pupils 
were taken to the grounds in ox carts generously furnished by friends of the schools. 
The programme, a copy of which was sent to the commissioner, consisted of the salute 
to the flag, literary and musical contests in the two languages, and athletic events. 
Representatives from the three towns were matched against each other, Corozal gaining 
the greatest number of points. The board of judges consisted of the presidents of the 
three school boards, several teachers, and prominent people of the district.” 
Adjuntas district —‘Thanksgiving and Arbor Day, Lincoln’s Centenary, Washing- 
ton’s Birthday, and Memorial Day were generally observed in the schools of this dis- 
trict during the present school year. 
“For the observance and proper celebration of the above-mentioned school holidays, 
circular letters from this office were issued to the teachers; these circulars give a brief 
outline of the nature of the exercises to be held and the points which should be 
emphasized. 
“Judging from the programmes of the exercises held in the rural schools, as well as| 
from personal knowledge of those carried out in the graded schools during the cele- 
bration of these school holidays, revealing interest on the part of teachers and parents| 
and real enthusiasm on the part of pupils, we feel warranted to say that these schoo! 
festivals are yearly gaining a firmer grasp upon the popular feeling. 
“Although it is our belief that too extensive and protracted preparations for schoo! 
festivals are at best to be discountenanced as directly interfering with the regula 
school work, yet at the same time we must acknowledge that the school fiesta is nowa- 
days one effective means through which a majority of the parents and a large part o 
the general public are brought into actual contact with the work of our schools. An 
if it is also true that through this agency an active propaganda can be made in favoi 
of the schools and their work it is no less certain that there is the lurking danger o| 
parents and others overestimating the ability of a teacher who successfully plans an: 
organizes a school fiesta whose spectacular features appeal to the popular mind in suc 
a way that the people of the community are misled into the belief that the teacher i 
deeply interested in his work, whereas in reality outside of the organization of suc 
school fiestas his ability as a teacher and the interest in all other features of scho: 
work are nil, and vice versa. Many an able teacher, who is at heart interested in hi 
work and is daily trying to do his best, is not rightly appreciated by most of the peop 
in the community because of his refusal to prepare theatricals or exercises partaki. 
of a popular nature, but who rather insists on the instructive features of the exercis 
to be held for the celebration of school festivals. 
“Thanksgiving and Arbor Day were celebrated in the graded schools with a sele 
programme. A delegation of pupils from each grade undertook to care for the tr 
they planted during the school year. As a feature of the Thanksgiving celebratioi 
most of the pupils brought contributions in the way of money or groceries to be dij 
tributed among the poor. The music for the occasion was supplied by the sch 
board. In the rural schools the exercises were of a simpler nature and were large 
allusive to the origin and the significance of the occasion celebrated. 
‘‘Washington’s Birthday was another occasion for an extensive programme in 
the schools of the district. Teachers and pupils are more enthusiastic over the ce!

bration of this school holiday than perhaps any other. The result was that the day 
was very fittingly observed. 
“At these celebrations at the graded schools the mayor of the municipality and the 
president of the school board addressed the teachers and pupils. As a rule, a larger 
contingent of parents attend our school fiestas at the graded schools than we are able 
to accommodate with seats. Owing to the reduced limits of the room used for an 
assembly hall and the growing enrollment of pupils each year, the celebration of a 
school festival in Adjuntas is fast becoming a physical impossibility. Our hopes are, 
however, based at the present time upon the construction in the near future of another 
graded school building, wherein arrangements may be made to have an assembly hall 
of such capacity as would accommodate the greater part of the older pupils at school 
festivals. 
“The exercises at the celebration of a school fiesta are generally a part of the regular 
work of the schools. Memory work is used to much advantage, and in the higher 
grades compositions written by pupils on historical characters fitting to the occasion 
are brought into combination with the regular every-day school work. Thus the 
school fiesta should be more or less a demonstration of the actual-work done by pupils 
in school and not in any way a pretense or brilliant appearance put forth by the child 
to cover up a multitude of things which he ought to learn in school.”     
                         
         
   
       
   
    
    
   
       
    
       
    
       
     
   University or Porro Rico. 
The University of Porto Rico was established by an act of the insular legislature 
approved March 12, 1903, as an organization for the gradual development of facilities 
for higher education in Porto Rico. This law vested the government of the new 
institution in a corporation known as the ‘‘Board of trustees of the University of 
Porto Rico,” of which the governor of Porto Rico is the honorary president, and the 
commissioner of education is president ex officio. It provided the board with an 
income from the insular revenues and authorized the solicitation of federal and private 
laid. It established a normal department by transferring the Insular Normal School 
with its grounds, buildings, and equipment, and current appropriation from the 
department of education to the board of trustees of the university. It provided 
ithe basis of an agricultural and mechanical department by transferring to the board 
f trustees a farm of 100 acres in Rio Piedras, previously purchased by the commis- 
ioner of education at a cost of $9,700 out of the general school extension fund, a fund 
onstituted from customs on Porto Rican importations collected before 1901 and 
efunded by the Federal Government on the institution of free trade. And it 
thorized the institution of the following additional departments, in the order given, 
soon as the necessary funds should be available: A department of the natural 
ciences and engineering, a department of liberal arts, a department of medicine, a 
epartment of law, a department of pharmacy, a department of architecture, and a 
niversity hospital. 
The normal department was organized on July 1, 1903. A department of agri- 
‘ulture was established in October, 1904. No other departments have been actually 
ttempted on account of the lack of funds, since the hope of the founders that private 
onations would be forthcoming has never been realized, and their hope of federal 
id was not realized until May, 1908, when an allotment under the Morrill Act was 
eived which can not, however, be used for the erection of buildings. 
NORMAL DEPARTMENT. 
The normal department is situated on a tract of 23 acres lying along the military 
ad at a distance of 7 miles from the capital and just outside the village of Rio Piedras. 
location is ideal, as the elevation and the breeze from the northeast render it 
‘ily the best location near San Juan for school purposes. It offers to graduates of

the eighth grade a two and a four year course in normal training. At the end of 
the two-year ‘course the students receive an elementary certificate which can be 
exchanged for a rura! or graded certificate, according to the age of the holder. On 
the completion of th» four-year course a diploma is given, which entitles the holder 
to the principal’s cer ficate when he has satisfied the necessary requirements of the 
law in regard to age 1nd experience. A s ecial course of one year to graduates of 
high schools is also oliered.

   FREE SCHOLARSHIPS. 
The qualifications of scholarship studenis are set forth in the following law, passed. 
and approved March 12, 1908: 
“Seventy-five young men and young women, seventy of whom shall be, in so far as 
possible, ten from each electoral district, of not less than sixteen nor more than twenty 
years of age, of good health, honest and intelligent, and who otherwise would be unable, 
to continue their education beyond the common schools, shall be awarded by the| 
committee hereinafter established scholarships in recognition of diligence and excel-| 
lence in the work of the common schools, each of the value of one hundred and eight; 
dollars, payable in nine equal monthly installments of twenty dollars for each schoo! 
month, for the purpose of studying in the normal department of the University o! 
Porto Rico, with the end in view of obtaining the diploma of this school. 
“Candidates for scholarships shall have successfully and creditably passed th 
examination conducted by the department of education for the eighth-grade diplom: 
of the public schools; if awarded scholarships they shall enter the first-year class of th 
normal department, and before entering they shall be required to promise in writin; 
that when their studies are completed they will devote themselves to teaching in th 
public schools of Porto Rico, beginning as soon as they shall be able to secure position| 
as teachers and continuing for a period of at least three years. 
“When all or part of said scholarship students shall have passed the necessar 
examinations and obtained the elementary certificate of the normal department, th 
commissioner of education may select not more than forty young men and women 
continue their studies through the advanced course: Provided, That the commission 
of education may, at his discretion, include among the said forty students not mor] 
than fifteen young men and women who hold a diploma showing a completion of 
four years’ course in a high school of Porto Rico during the year immediately precedii 
the election.” 
In accordance with the provisions of this act 75 persons have been chosen as schol 
ship holders for the coming year.

versity, and the number of instructors employed:

   For the year 1909-10 fifteen teachers have been appointed in the normal and nine 
in the practice school. 
Nearly all the work has been carried on in English during the past year, and for the 
coming year it is planned to have all the work done in English, with the exception 
of the classes in Spanish language and literature. An attempt will also be made to 
encourage the speaking of English in the boarding houses, in order that a knowledge 
of conversational English may be developed. 
* * * * * * * 
SUMMER SESSION. 
In order to fill a long-felt want in educational matters in Porto Rico, the board of 
trustees of the university decided to conduct a summer session of eight weeks in the 
normal buildings, and under the direction of the regular normal faculty. Such an 
opportunity for two months’ study under excellent instructors was an unprecedented 
thing in the history of the island, and the teachers were not backward in taking 
advantage of the opportunities presented. Special courses were offered in music, 
domestic science, manual training, English, Spanish, physics, geometry, geography, 
physiology, nature study, arithmetic, algebra, pedagogy, and psychology. 
In addition to the above-named courses, opportunity was also given to those teachers 
who were planning to take the examination for the English graded license to spend 
one period each day teaching in English, under the observation of a skilled critic 
teacher. Observation classes were also a special feature of the summer’s work, and 
from the teachers in the department of education two American and two Porto Rican 
teachers were chosen who conducted classes in all the subjects taught in the graded 
schools, with the idea of giving the summer students some new ideas in the way of 
discipline, conduct of classes, personal work of the teacher, etc. 
The advance enrollment far exceeded our expectations, but before the end of the 
first week the enrollment reached its highest point—367 persons. Practically every 
town on the island was represented. The total enrollment was distributed among 
ithe different classes of teachers as follows:

    A course in manual training was given during the summer session, and the work 
as very enthusiastically taken up by about twenty teachers. The reception that 
oth manual training and domestic science have met in the normal department since 
eir introduction is very auspicious for the future success of the industrial training.

THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. 
Great progress has been made during the year 1908-9 in the organization and devel- 
pment of this department. 
The title to a 40-acre tract of land adjoining the United States experiment station 
; Mayaguez has been perfected, and the plans for a building to cost $30,000 com- 
leted. Ground will be broken for this building within a short time. After its 
mpletion the work of the department can be carried on in two different parts of the 
and, varying materially in climatic conditions and character of the soil. In this 
ay the agricultural needs of the whole island can be better served.

As dean of the agricultural department the services of J. William Hart have been 
secured. Dean Hart received his professional training in the higher agricultural 
institutions of Canada, was later a member of the faculty of the University of Illinois, 
and still more recently at the head of important agricultural interests in Brazil under 
that Government. Dean Hart comes to us fully trained for his important work and 
with extended experience in the problems of tropical agriculture. 
For the coming year agricultural instruction will be given only at Rio Piedras. 
“Here a new dairy building has been completed at a cost of $6,000. 
Forty scholarships in the department have been established by the trustees and 
full courses of instruction organized.

   CHAPTER VI. 
EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES. 
The following information with reference to public instruction in 
he Philippines is derived from official reports issued by the insular 
epartment of public instruction.t They bring the record of the 
chools to June 30, 1909. 
The past scholastic year was marked by the retirement of Doctor 
arrows, who for six years had filled the office of director of edu- 
ation, and upon whom had fallen in great measure the difficult 
Kk of organizing the work and adapting the system and methods 
lharacteristic of our own country to the entirely different conditions 
isting in the Philippine Islands. 
The progress in the establishment of schools and in school attend- 
ce is indicated by the following statistical summaries:

   According to Doctor Barrows the year under review, judged fro: 
nearly every standpoint, was the most successful since the organiza: 
tion of the bureau of education. As regards primary educatio: 
he says: 
This recent progress brings us measurably closer than ever before to a comple 
system of primary public schools. As is generally understood, the first and earlies} 
duty imposed upon the bureau of education was the organization of such a schoo 
system, adequate to give elementary schooling to the entire Christian populatioi 
and in recent years the success of school work has been measured by its approxim: 
tion to this standard. The plan for the realization of this purpose was outlined i 
1904 at the division superintendents’ convention of that year, and was published i 
the courses of study prescribed by the director of education. This primary instru: 
tion was made as short as was believed to be consistent with practical results to th| 
children. At first it was only three years, but in 1907 it was extended to four ye: 
The problem of comprehensive primary instruction may be discussed about as fo! 
lows: In 1903 the Christian population was found by census to number 6,987,6 
souls. It is now estimated to be about 7,500,000. The ‘‘school population” in 
United States and elsewhere is commonly reckoned to include all children and yout 
between the ages of 5 and 18. Using the same percentages in the Philippines th: 
have been determined for the United States, there should be about 2,100,000 of t] 
population between these years of age. It must be borne in mind, however, in tall 
ing about school population, that probably in no country, and certainly not here 
the Philippines, is it aimed to keep under constant instruction this entire fraction 
the population. 
In the United States the common or grammar school course covers eight years, bi 
the average child actually completes only a little over one-half of it. Here in 
Philippines our primary course is only four years in length, but the aim is to have 
children complete all of it. If, as we calculate, there are 2,100,000 children ai 
youths between the ages of 5 and 18, our primary course being only four years, 
one-third of this period of twelve years, the realization of our object only req 
the regular attendance of one-third of these children, or about 700,000. 
The total enrollment in the public schools of all grades—570,502 
was equivalent to 7.5 per cent of the population. Naturally the v; 
majority of these pupils, namely, 549,607 (334,205 boys, 215,4 
girls), were in the primary grade. 
From a detailed study of each district, recently made by t 
respective division superintendents, Doctor Barrows concludes t 
to meet the entire needs of the population there should be 6,0 
primary schools and 12,000 teachers. ‘‘That such a system co 
rapidly be created,” he says, ‘‘if sufficient resources were provid

   I have not the slightest doubt. The rapid growth of our school sys- 
tem in the nine years since the organization of the bureau of edu- 
cation is a demonstration of what has been done even with fluc- 
tuating and inadequate resources and without the aid of compulsory 
attendance.” 
As regards the length of school year and school attendance he 
continues: 
The Filipino child who attends school regularly gets considerably more schooling 
in the course of a year than in some other countries. In the United States the aver- 
age length of the school year is about one hundred and fifty-two days; in the Phil- 
ippines the school year is forty weeks, or a total of two hundred actual days of school. 
Of these forty weeks, however, it is customary to take four and sometimes more in 
each province for a teachers’ institute, during which primary schools are closed, 
put not intermediate and high schools. The school year opens about the middle 
of June and terminates about the end of March. 
* * * * * * * 
“School attendance” is calculated on the basis of monthly enrollment. There 
was an average of 85 per cent for the Archipelago. Manila led with 97 per cent; 
Nueva Vizcaya had 90; Union, Tayabas, and Tarlac, 89. In eight divisions the 
attendance was below 80 per cent; Bataan, Pampanga, and Bulacan, 79; Ilocos 
Norte, Pangasinan, and Isabela, 76; Cavite, 75; and Sorsogon, 68. In the inter- 
mediate and high schools attendance is excellent, seldom falling below 90 per cent 
anywhere. The numbers in the higher grades of the primary course were a little 
higher than formerly, but not nearly what they should be. Taking the figures for 
February, there were in Grade I, 280,816 children attending; Grade II, 87,686; 
Grade III, 35,438; Grade IV, 17,795. These figures can be compared with those 
of March, 1908, when there were in Grade I, 233,020; Grade II, 81,604; Grade IIT, 
30,899; Grade IV, 14,215. The large enrollment in Grade I and the rapid diminu- 
tion in the succeeding grades show two things: First, that a considerable proportion 
of the children fail to pass the examinations for promotion, supposedly due in large 
part to their irregular attendance; and second, that a very large number do not con- 
tinue in school for more than one or two years. 
The importance of a compulsory school-attendance law is recog- 
nized, but, in the judgment of the Philippine Commission, the time 
has not come when such a law could be enforced. 
INTERMEDIATE SCHOOLS. 
At the end of the school year there were 193 schools giving intermediate instruc- 
In them were enrolled 18,502 pupils, of whom 14,495 were boys and 4,007 
These intermediate schools are somewhat unevenly distributed. There are 
o less than 18 in the Province of Iloilo; 11 in Occidental Negros; 9 in Bulacan, 
land 9 in Laguna; 8 each in Nueva Ecija and Batangas; 7 each in Tarlac, Pangasinan, 
locos Sur, and Cebu. * * * With the increase in number of young people fit 
take intermediate instruction, the demand for the establishment of intermediate 
ichools becomes more and more insistent. There are at the present time 685 muni- 
‘ipalities in the Philippines, and the time will probably come when every one of 
ese towns will want an intermediate school. * * * Intermediate schools, 
owever, are much more expensive to conduct than primary schools; a considerable 
roportion of the teachers must still be Americans, while the shop, agricultural, and 
ousekeeping instruction call for special teachers and special equipment. An inter- 
diate school also requires its own grounds and building or buildings, the con-
-P-A-G-E-302
    294 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910, 
struction of which it is difficult to finance. For all of these reasons the development 
of the intermediate school system must be slow unless some source of maintenance 
for them is provided. 
The instruction in intermediate schools has now been specialized so as to give 
pupils the opportunity of a training in shop work, farming, domestic science, in 
preparation for teaching or for business.” When the intermediate school course was 
first developed, it was aimed to give it a distinct and practical character, and it was 
provided that the boy and girl should receive instruction not only in common branches, 
but in elementary science and in such subjects as agriculture, tool work, mechanical 
drawing, and housekeeping. But the effort to include all of these subjects in the 
intermediate training of every pupil resulted in overloading the course and in giving 
an insufficient training in the branches pursued. Hereafter the pupil who has com- 
pleted the primary course and gained the fundamental knowledge of reading, writing, 
and ciphering will be allowed to choose what his further studies shall be and to what 
they shall lead. 
* * * * * * * 
The intermediate courses now provided by this bureau are the following: The 
general course, the course for teaching, the course in farming, the course in tool work, 
the course in housekeeping and household arts, the course for business. 
Each of these courses occupies three years; certain studies—reading, English gram- 
mar and composition, arithmetic, and geography—run through them all. In the 
course in farming three hours daily are spent in gardening and plant nurseries, field 
work on staple Philippine crops, and the care and use of farm animals. In the course 
in tool work three hours a day are given to shop practice. In the course in house- 
keeping and household arts, three hours a day are given to loom weaving, spinning, 
dyeing and embroidery, cutting and fitting of garments, housekeeping, plain cooking, 
physiology and hygiene, nursing, the care of infants, sick diet, and infant diet. In 
the course for business, in addition to the grammar-school subjects, are taught hand- 
writing and plain lettering, spelling and dictation, typewriting, bookkeeping, busi- 
ness correspondence, and commercial geography. 
The course in teaching is designed to produce primary school teachers. For many 
years normal school and high school graduates who choose teaching will be needed in 
intermediate schools, where they take the place of American teachers. * * * This 
course provides two years’ instruction in music and drawing, a year of advanced in- 
struction in native arts and industries which are taught to pupils in the primary 
schools, a year of agriculture and gardening or of housekeeping, physiology and hy- 
giene, a year of Philippine history and government; and in the third year, two periods 
daily in school management and in practice teaching. 
* * sect * * * * 
The prescribed courses of study were more nearly realized last year than before. 
Uniform examinations are given under identical conditions to all pupils throughout 
the islands. These examinations help to keep the work in all divisions up to a chosen 
standard. In nearly all divisions, the primary school work in native arts and indus- 
tries is well established. This work includes mat weaving, hat braiding, basket con- 
struction, and similar exercises founded upon arts indigenous to the country. 
In the intermediate courses the agricultural work, shop work, mechanical drawing, 
and domestic science are given in the intermediate departments of nearly all the pro- 
vincial high schools. Twenty-one of these high schools have excellent shop equip- 
ment, including explosion engines and machine tools; 20 of them have constructed 
permanent shop buildings; 8 have buildings for domestic science instruction. The 
teaching of agriculture has been less satisfactory than that of shop work. The reason 
is mainly the unsatisfactory state of scientific agriculture in the Philippines at the 
present time. Few experiments in agricultural improvement made since the Ameri- 
can occupation have been successful. In nine cases out of ten the surest method of

   securing a crop with the least economic expenditure and the least chance of loss is the 
mode of husbandry practiced by the native. Instruction in agriculture is given never- 
theless at school farms and intermediate and high schools. The life and growth of 
plants is taught in the first year of the intermediate school, and is followed by a course 
in elementary zoology which prepares the way for agricultural entomology and agri- 
culture. Aside from school gardening and the cultivation of kitchen vegetables, of 
which there is a great deal, agricultural teaching aims at making a few specific points; 
the inclosing of agricultural land; permanent improvements to the soil; irrigation; 
fertilizing; and the better application of animal power. It is not sought to introduce 
new agricultural products except vegetables, study being confined to the present 
staples. 
By school gardens much good has been accomplished in improving and diversifying 
the diet of the common people. In some provinces a comprehensive plan has been car- 
ried out and every primary school plants and cultivates garden beds. As a result, the 
native markets, which six or seven years ago had nothing of the kind to offer, are now 
full of vegetables. 
* * * * * * * 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
Secondary courses were given last year in 37 schools to 1,802 students, of whom 310 
were young women. The instruction at present is given almost entirely by American 
teachers; the classes are small and the expense correspondingly large. The justifica- 
tion of secondary instruction and of the expenditures it occasions is the imperative 
demand for this people of trained and disciplined leaders and thoroughly prepared 
professional men. 
THE TEACHING FORCE. 
The number of teachers and supervisors employed in the schools 
was 8,774, of whom 6,204 were men and 2,570 women. The Ameri- 
can teachers numbered 825, namely, 570 men and 255 women. Doc- 
tor Barrows calls attention to the fact that the annual salaries of 
American teachers have been increased the last year. The present 
chedule rates range from 2,000 to 4,000 pesos ($1,000 to $2,000). 
Regret is expressed that owing to the anticipated reduction of the 
ppropriation for the coming year, very few teachers were offered 
ppointment in the United States, and accordingly at the opening of 
he present school year the force is more reduced in number than it 
as been at any time since its original organization in 1901. As a 
onsequence of this loss, it has been impossible for the department to 
eet the requests from provincial governors and other high officials 
or American teachers, even where their services were regarded as 
indispensable. 
The force of Filipino insular teachers has increased in number and 
proved in character. 
The regular training of Filipino teachers still continues to be an important feature 
f school work. Daily teachers’ classes are not as common as they were formerly, but 
e vacation institutes were held last year in all but three divisions. Besides these 
tablished methods for the instruction of teachers, the Philippine Normal School 
mducts a correspondence division for teachers of secondary attainments. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
  
  296 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
spring vacation—April and May—has come to be a time of special effort for teachers’ — 
instruction. During the last vacation both the Philippine Normal School and the 
Philippine School of Arts and Trades had vacation sessions. Besides courses in aca- 
demic subjects, technical courses were given in hand and loom weaving, hat making, 
gardening and elementary agriculture, cooking, sewing, woodworking, blacksmithing, 
wheelwrighting, mechanical drawing, loom construction, town and rural improvement, 
and other subjects in which Filipino teachers are seeking preparation. These courses 
were attended by 1,007 teachers and students, 33 provinces being represented. The 
young women’s dormitory of the normal school provided living accommodations 
for 199 of the women. 
The teachers’ camp and vacation assembly were held at Baguio again this year in 
April and May. The camp was even better conducted than the year before and the 
attendance somewhat larger. During the four weeks of the assembly session 266 people 
were accommodated, representing 36 school divisions. Six daily lecture courses in the 
fields of literature, politics, science, and Spanish were given, besides a series of open 
lectures through the session. 
The average salary of regular municipal teachers (i. e., Filipino teachers paid by 
municipalities) was P18.15 ($9.07) a month, being P'17.99 for men and P'18.47 for 
women, and for temporary teachers it was a little less and no vacation pay. Teachers’ 
salaries vary greatly in different divisions of the islands, being highest in the city of 
Manila, where regular teachers receive an average of P°66.63 ($33.31). After Manila the 
highest salaries are paid in Albay, Bulacan, Camarines, Batangas, Laguna, Palawan, 
Pangasinan, Pampanga, Surigao, Tayabas, and Rizal, where they receive over P20 
($10). The lowest average salary is paid in Ilocos Norte, P'9.73 ($4.86). It is very 
low also in Oriental Negros, P'10.55; Union, P*10.77; Bohol, P11.59; and Zambales, 
P 11.95. Such salaries do not represent living wages for the teachers. They are less| 
than they were formerly. In 1904 the average salary of municipal teachers was P*20.76| 
($10.38) for men and P20.99 ($10.49) for women.

   EDUCATION IN THE PHILIPPINES, 297 
ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 
With regard to instruction in language, the opinion is expressed, 
both by Doctor Barrows and the secretary of public instruction, 
Hon. Newton W. Gilbert, that the rapid spread of English is of thes 
utmost importance to the future prosperity of the islands. On this 
point the secretary says: 
The instruction in the public schools from the time of their inauguration until the 
present has been altogether in the English language. In the opinion of this depart- 
ment this is as it should be, for we can not expect the people of these islands to make 
great and lasting progress until they possess and use a common language, irrespective 
of what that language is. We have for nearly ten years been teaching the boys and 
girls of the Philippines to speak and write English, and they are now beginning to 
lenter the different avenues of Filipino life more or less prepared to take up their duties 
land burdens as citizens. Often, however, they find themselves handicapped by the 
ct that the language which they have learned is not everywhere in general use, 
ither in business or official circles. A young man educated in our public schools is 
uch disheartened, and to a considerable extent incapacitated, if, when he attempts 
utilize his training, he finds himself called upon to transact his daily business in 
e Spanish language. Municipalities throughout the islands still retain Spanish 
their official language, although in most of them there are ten persons who speak 
nglish to one who speaks Spanish. It is believed that the government should 
romptly take measures to establish English as the official language wherever possible. 
‘he recent postponement until January 1, 1913, of the time when English is to become 
e official language of the courts is a serious blow, not only to the public-school system 
ut to the Filipinos’ very proper desire for nationality. Aside from the fact that 
inglish is the only language which the people of the islands may in time hope to 
ossess in common, it is becoming more and more the universal language in which the 
usiness of the world is conducted; and as opportunities for the development of the 
aterial resources of the islands increase, we would greatly stimulate them by making 
e language of the Philippine Islands that which is so generally used by the business 
orld. 
Secretary Gilbert was appointed chief of the department March 1, 
909; consequently, as he explains, the greater part of the work 
bove reviewed was accomplished under his predecessor. His report, 
owever, indicates, on the whole, the purpose to continue the policies 
lready adopted. 
The following citations from the secretary’s report indicate the 
utlook with respect to salient features of the general system: 
  PHILIPPINE NORMAL SCHOOL. 
This important branch of our school work has been developed and improved through- 
tt the past year, and to-day there are more students in attendance at the normal 
‘hool than there have ever been before. The work of this institution has year by 
ar been extended until now it provides not only a normal-school education, but also a, 
mber of special courses, which it was thought should be given somewhere and for 
ich no other school offered facilities. Insensibly, and apparently of necessity, the 
ergies of the institution have been spread over various fields of education, perhaps 
ewhat to the detriment of the purposes which its organizers had in mind. It is 
lieved that the necessity for doing a large part of this work at the normal school has
-P-A-G-E-306

   ended, and that as opportunities for carrying it on elsewhere are given the work of that, 
school may again step by step be restricted to the definite purposes for which the 
institution was created. 
* * * * * * * 
The normal school is attended by hundreds of earnest youths, both boys and girls. 
All provinces of the islands are represented among its students. It has been of vast 
benefit to the schools everywhere, and by training teachers in larger numbers it is| 
believed that its benefits may be even more greatly felt in the future. As stated| 
above, the policy of the department is to develop the school along strictly normal lines, 
and to offer, if possible, larger salaries to those who have completed its course tha: 
are given to teachers who have not acquired training of this character. 
FILIPINO STUDENTS IN THE UNITED STATES. 
From the general appropriations made for the bureau of education from year 
year there have been maintained in various educational institutions in the Unite 
States a considerable number of Filipino students. This seemed absolutely necessai 
a few years ago, but as conditions here have changed the need thereof has become les 
and less. Weare able now to give training in many branches and courses which her 
tofore could be secured only by going outside of the Philippine Islands; and as th 
various colleges of the university are organized and developed, the necessity of sen: 
ing our students away to be educated will disappear entirely. Even now it is believe 
that a better education in tropical medicine can be secured in the Philippine Medic: 
School than can be acquired by Filipino students in the United States. Owing 
the decreased appropriations for school purposes and the urgent need of economy, 
we are to continue the work already begun, it is believed that, in general, mone} 
appropriated for educational purposes can be better spent in the islands than jj 
maintaining students abroad. A thousand pesos here will accomplish more ai 
benefit a larger number of people than a thousand pesos spent in the United Stat 
Therefore, it is believed best at least to restrict to the minimum, if not altogether 
discontinue, the appointment of additional students to the United States. 
NONCHRISTIAN TRIBES. 
A special effort is being made to develop school work among the so-called no: 
Christians of the provinces of Nueva Vizcaya, Agusan, and the Mountain Provine 
Larger appropriations for this purpose have been made by the commission than he 
tofore, and courses devised which in many respects are a modification of the cot 
given in other parts of the islands, and which, it is believed, are better suited to 
needs of these primitive people. In many localities the inhabitants are displayi 
the keenest interest in the work, and the results so far obtained are most encouragi 
and seem to promise greater returns than have yet attended our efforts. 
THE UNIVERSITY OF THE PHILIPPINES. 
During the latter part of the fiscal year the matter of establishing some of the 
leges provided for the University of the Philippines—an institution authorized by 
first Philippine legislature at its special session—was taken up. The appropriati 
made for this purpose was most meager, but a beginning has none the less been 
The Philippine Medical School, established by a special act some years ago, WI 
by the provisions of. the ‘‘university act,” to become the school of medicine of 
university whenever two other schools were equipped and in operation. The re; 
of the dean of the Philippine Medical School speaks for itself. It shows the 
standards which have been set for that institution and the excellent work whicl 
has done.

    The board of regents of the University of the Philippines established an agricul- 
ural college and a school of fine arts, both of which are now in operation, and has 
rovided for a college of veterinary science, which will be opened as soon as buildings 
r its use can be constructed. 
The college of agriculture has been located near Los Bafios. The bureau of educa- 
ion had already secured options upon lands in the province of La Laguna, some 3 
iles from that municipality, to be used for an agricultural school. These options 
ere turned over to the board of regents; the land has been bought and the registra- 
ion of the title is now being sought through the court of land registration; pending 
e securing of which it is not possible under the law to erect permanent buildings. 
lans have been prepared, however, and as soon as the title is registered bids will be 
cured for the construction of these buildings. Meanwhile a temporary building 
s been erected in which classes are being conducted and a school maintained. 
me 50 students have been admitted and are showing much interest in their work, 
ming to understand that the future of this country depends very largely upon 
ricultural development. 
The school of fine arts was temporarily ener an in the city of Manila ina house 
mted for that purpose on Calle San Sebastian, Quiapo. An exceedingly great 
ount of interest was taken in this school and hundreds of the Filipino youth applied 
r admission. By gradually eliminating the inept the number of students has been 
nsiderably reduced, so that the faculty, which consists of 7 professors, is now able 
handle the students in a fairly satisfactory manner. 
For a veterinary college land has been secured in connection with the Pandacan 
arantine station, and here is being constructed an animal hospital and schoolrooms 
d laboratories for the study of veterinary science. As soon as these buildings are 
impleted classes will be opened. 
It is hoped that the legislature will provide for the opening in the near future of a 
lege of liberal arts and a college of engineering as a part of the university, under 
control of the board of regents. 
‘his body has taken a very active and earnest interest in the establishment and 
eration of these various schools, with the successful inauguration of which will, as 
before been stated, pass the necessity of sending students to the United States to

THE INES STE SYSTEM OF VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS FROM 
1884 TO 1909. 
Contents.—Historical review of the system.—List of secondary vocational schools.—Organization and Tules. 
The third report of the Royal Prussian State Industrial Office 
(Verwaltungsbericht des Kéniglich Preussischen Landesgewerbeamts, 
1909) traces the development of the present system of vocational 
schools (der gewerblichen und kunstgewerblichen Fachschulen) dur- 
ing the 25 years for which the ministry of trade and commerce has 
been responsible for its administration. The report, which com- 
prises 436 pages besides numerous statistical folders, is introduced 
by an historical review (48 pp.), and this is followed by detailed 
accounts, statistical and textual, of the various classes of schools 
which make up the system considered. 
The present chapter comprises Part I, the substance of the intro- 
duction, including the general historical survey, which has been 
translated, and the summarized discussion of the detailed exhibits, 
which maintains also the historical character. The latter portion 
has been treated somewhat more freely, as seemed necessary to make 
clear to the American reader conditions unlike those prevailing in 
this country. 
Part IT comprises a table of secondary vocational schools in Prussia. 
Part III presents details of the classes of trade schools specified, 
drawn from the elaborate accounts appended to the historical review 
already considered, with additional particulars derived from a report 
emanating from the same office (Gewerbliche Fachschulen in Preus- 
sen, ihre Einrichtung und 6rtliche Verteilung, herausgegeben vom 
Konig]. Landesgewerbeamt).?

  TRANSFER OF THE SYSTEM. 
In the two years, from October 1, 1907, to October 1, 1909, which 
this report covers, there occurred a significant memorial day for the 
dministration of commerce and industry. September 3, 1909, was

just 25 years from the day His Majesty the Emperor and King Wil- 
helm I gave the order to transfer all the affairs of industrial education 
to the minister of commerce. This order of September 3, 1884 (see 
Gesetz-Samlung, 1885, p. 93), reads: 
Upon report of the entire ministry of state,4 dated August 31 of this year, I approve 
of the transfer of all vocational industrial schools, so-called trade schools, and schools 
of industrial art and design, and other institutions for the promotion of industrial art, 
including the administration of the porcelain manufactory, and the system of continua- 
tion schools, to the department of the minister of commerce and industry. This order 
is to be made known through the channel of the collection of laws.b I intrust its exe- 
cution to the minister of commerce and industry and the minister of worship, educa- 
tion, and medical affairs. 
This transfer took place April 1, 1885. 
The cause and the procedure of the transfer of the industrial edu- 
cational system to the department of the minister of commerce are 
not without interest. In 1883 the chief master of the Berlin wood- 
turning guild entered complaint that he had not succeeded in obtain- 
ing a state subsidy for the continued maintenance of the guild-school, 
and he finally sent his complaint to the imperial chancellor, Prince 
Bismarck, who was at the time also minister of commerce in Prussia, 
and who on more than one occasion had shown a warm interest in the 
trades and their organization. Prince Bismarck utilized this occa- 
sion to enter into negotiations with the minister of worship and edu- 
cation concerning a transfer of the industrial educational system. 
The negotiations finally led to a report submitted to the entire cabi- 
net, whose deliberations culminated in the royal order cited. 
In the appropriation bills of the year 1885-86 the transfer of the 
funds relating to industrial schools was made from the funds for the 
general school system to that of the ministry of commerce and 
industry. To the House of Deputies [the lower house of the Prussian 
legislature], together with the budget, a memorial was submitted 
which pointed out the fact that the secondary system of industrial 
schools of Prussia, including the institutions of industrial art and 
schools of design, despite the progress they had made in recent years, 
could not be compared with like systems of other German States and 
of foreign countries; in order to raise the system [of vocational] 
educational institutions] to a higher level of efficiency, much more} 
support and careful promotion would be required in the future than| 
it had received in the past. 
The following is a portion of the memorial: 
       
              
       
    The importance of the promotion and financial support of the industrial system le’ 
to each individual State has increased to a higher degree during recent years thai 
formerly, owing to the course the development of the national economic life has taken 
and the increased demands made upon this branch of the royal administration hav

ihown that the latter stands in intimate relation to the lower and secondary industrial 
system of instruction as well as to the promotion of industrial art, and that it can not 
atisfactorily perform its duty so long as these institutions belong to the administra- 
ion of another department. In such questions as that of the steps to take for the 
economic uplift of certain parts of the State through the awakening of new, or the 
levelopment of existing, branches of industry, as that of the improvement of the 
sondition of small trades in competition with large factory production, or that of the 
maintenance or promotion of the competitive capacity of native industries against 
mcroaching foreign industries, the establishment and management of industrial 
vocational schools play so decisive a réle that the ministry of commerce and industry 
inds itself constantly hindered in its activity so long as it is denied the power of initia- 
ive and of authoritative influence upon the system of schools, which in the nature of 
he case should be its prime sources of assistance. On the other hand, questions such 
is for what branches of industry, to what extent, and at what places should mono- 
echnical schools be established; what purposes they should keep in view, and others, 
an be solved with certainty and for longer periods of time, and in due relation to the 
mntire interests of the State, only by the authorities created for the purpose of pro- 
noting the national industry, which authorities should also have the required means 
yf acquainting themselves with the conditions of industrial development and of gain- 
ng a comprehensive view of its local needs, and at the same time should be able to 
ceep in touch with all the various related agencies, such as chambers of commerce, 
suilds, and other industrial corporations, from which cooperation in the solution of 
uch questions is to be expected. 
With this the programme for the further development of the new 
ranch of service of the ministry of commerce and industry was 
lefined clearly and without the least ambiguity, namely: Promotion 
of industrial continuation and vocational schools in the service of 
he interests of commerce, industry, and handicraft, and the foster- 
ng of such a system of instruction as an inseparable part of the 
ational economic policy. 
The development of the past 25 years has made it more and more 
vident that the system of secondary technical instruction can 
ourish in accord with this programme only if the ministry of com- 
erce and industry seeks and maintains intimate connection with 
hose agencies which are engaged in manufacture and other industrial 
ursuits, for which it is bound to provide skilled laborers; if the ever- 
hanging needs of commerce, trades, and factories find careful con- 
ideration, and if it is remembered that industrial failure is threat- 
ed when the schools, instead of serving industry, merely serve their 
wn. purposes. 
Another service of great importance the system can render under 
e management of the ministry of commerce and industry, namely, 
at of opening up possibilities of earning a livelihood to young people 
ho are striving to rise from modest economic to better conditions; 
aiding the process of the rejuvenation of our nation and thereby 
iping out class distinctions. At the close of a period of 25 years, in 
hich, more than ever before, class distinctions and class hatred 
ve been catchwords in public discussion, it may be allowed to 
int to the fact that, thanks to the influence of our secondary sys-

tem of technical instruction—slowly and almost. imperceptibly—e 
leveling upward to better conditions of life has taken place; tha’ 
numerous persons, quite poor, and equipped with only the simples: 
elementary education, have been enabled, through our schools o 
mechanical engineering, schools for the building trades, and othe: 
vocational schools, to acquire, though often at great sacrifices, tech 
nical knowledge and accomplishments, which have opened source: 
of income hitherto closed to them or secured them higher wages, si 
that not infrequently they themselves have been enabled to rise t 
the ‘‘class” of contractors. 
The peculiarity of our system of secondary technical schools ani 
of the elementary industrial continuation schools is found in this 
that their aim is to make the matter of instruction immediateh 
applicable to industrial life. This is the essential difference betwee 
them and the schools belonging to the ministry of worship and edu 
cation. Despite this essential distinction it should not be forgotter 
that the industrial continuation and vocational schools build upo1 
the foundations laid by the general system of schools, that the bounda 
ries of the two administrations are contiguous throughout, that th 
teachers of the two systems are interchanged, and that through thi 
action very close relations are established. 
The ministry of commerce and industry has been enabled, unde 
the most favorable conditions, to extend the work so well begun by 
its predecessor. The past 25 years represent a period of rapid devel 
opment in national commerce and industry, and, together with th 
need for the development of secondary technical instruction an 
continuation schools, the means placed at the disposal of State an 
communities for that purpose have increased most satisfactorily. _ 
STATISTICAL SURVEY.     
  The memorial quoted above contained a list of schools to be tra 
ferred to the ministry of commerce, which list embraced 56 seconda: 
vocational schools, aside from the then existing elementary continu: 
tion schools. Of these 56 schools only 34 had received state subs| 
dies, and from the accounts of the annual appropriations it is se 
that in 1885 there were provided half a million marks (or abo 
$120,000) for subsidies; part of this sum, however, was used fi 
elementary continuation schools. 
A comparison with the subsidized schools now in existence sho 
the enormous degree to which the opportunities for industrial educ| 
tion have increased. (See list of subsidized schools on p. 324). B 
not only in the purely vocational schools, the number of students 
which increased from about 8,000 in 1885 to 44,000 in 1908, is 
advance noticeable, but particularly gratifying progress is shown 
the continuation school system. In 1884 there were 664 elementa|    
   
    
     
  
-P-A-G-E-313
  PRUSSIAN SYSTEM OF VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS. 805 
continuation schools with about 58,400 students, while at present 
(in 1909) there are 1,719 industrial and 381 commercial, or a total of 
2,100 continuation schools with 360,000 students. The total number 
of young people and wage-earning laborers enjoying the benefits of 
vocational instruction has increased even more, if we include the 
journeymen and masters attending the trade-master courses, which 
only began in 1900 as a regular institution. 
The regular expenditure of the state for the whole industrial sys- 
tem of instruction increased from 1881 to 1884 only a little more than 
200,000 marks ($47,600), and the appropriations for 1885 amounted 
to 569,000 marks ($135,422). As under the new administration the 
schools increased in number, the appropriation increased by 300,000 
marks ($71,400) in one year, and after four years the increase 
amounted to 1,158,000 marks ($275,604), so that the whole budget 
showed an expenditure of 1,727,000 marks ($411,026). During the 
following five years another increase in the State’s subsidy of 560,000 
marks ($133,280) is recorded, so that in 1895 the sum of 2,287,000 
arks ($544,306) was applicable. 
During the last decade, the expenditures for the purposes indicated 
ave grown so remarkably that for the elementary continuation 
hools alone the sum is needed that in 1896 was appropriated for 
ll purposes of technical education. At present the appropriations 
mount to 11,000,000 marks ($2,618,000). Including the sums 
pent for navigation schools, for technical schools of steamship 
ngineering, for the labor intelligence bureau of the Silesian embroid- 
ry schools, and all expenses defrayed from the deficiency fund, 
here is provided by the State for the year 1910 a total of 13,000,009 
arks ($3,094,000). 
To these state subsidies [it must be emphasized that these sums 
e merely subsidies, and that even much larger sums are expended 
yy provincial grants, communities, corporations, guilds, and private 
ms for the maintenance of a technical or vocational school system] 
lhould be added the incidental expenses for books and work mate- 
ial, which during the period of 1881-1884 amounted to only 39,000 
arks ($9,282), but since then rose, during periods of five years, 
amely, 1890, 1895, 1900, and 1905, as follows: 224,600 marks 
53,455), 128,550 marks ($30,595), 612,700 marks ($145,823), and 
60,000 marks ($61,880). For this purpose alone the administration 
ent 4,530,000 marks ($1,108,140) during the 25 years from 1885 
1909. 
As was stated before, the state government is not the only con- 
‘ibutor to the support of this system of schools that provides recruits 
r the industrial army. The communities also have increased their 
ota. While in 1885 the cities paid for the schools about 100,000 
arks ($23,800), which the State subsidized with 300,000 marks

($71,400), six years later the cities paid 500,000 marks ($119,000), 
and in 1896 as much as 750,000 marks ($178,500). At present the| 
cities alone spend for industrial art and trade schools 1,300,000 marks 
($309,400), for schools for the building trades 370,000 marks ($88,060) , 
and for schools for metal workers 260,000 marks ($62,480). In thi 
connection it should be noted also that the communities offer gra 
tuitously all their school buildings for continuation schools (evenin, 
and secular Sunday schools); also that, aided by corporations, the 
erect the buildings for secondary vocational schools—with very fe 
exceptions—and keep them in repair. These special school build. 
ings represent a large capital, for in recent years such sums as 300,00 
marks ($71,400), 400,000 marks ($95,200), 600,000 marks ($142,800) 
800,000 marks ($190,400), and in a few cases as much as 1,000,00 
marks ($238,000) have been expended by a single city for the erec 
tion of industrial vocational schools. Up to the year 1884 sue! 
local expenditures ranged only from 50,000 marks ($11,900) t 
80,000 marks ($19,040); in a few cases to 150,000 marks ($35,700 
and 200,000 marks ($47,600). 
        
   
      
   
    
       
    
      
    
       
     
      
   
     
               ADMINISTRATION. 
In computing the expenditures of the separate vocational schoo. 
there are still other items to be added not mentioned in the foregoin| 
statements, namely, the costs of administration at the Central Offi 
in Berlin and at the seats of the separate provincial government 
Here again the difference between the sums expended previous 
1885 and since that date is very large. Previous to the transfer 
the system of vocational schools from the ministry.of education 
that of commerce and industry there were at the Central Office on! 
1 ministerial councilor (division chief) and 3 clerks engaged in mai 
aging the affairs; their salaries, together with the incidental expens: 
of the office, amounted to 32,215 marks ($7,668). From these mo 
est beginnings have come into existence a government bureau wii 
a commissioner (director) and 4 ministerial councilors and the admi 
istrative office of technical or vocational schools with 6 ministeri 
councilors, presided over by the commissioner (director) of the ed 
cational bureau of the ministry of commerce and industry. T 
part of the ministry, with its provincial branches, has now 19 go 
ernmental and industrial councilors, who watch over and direct t. 
affairs and the inner workings of the system, and attend to t 
appointment and promotion of teachers. The annual appropriati 
bill of 1910 contains the itemized expenses of this government 
machinery, which amount to a total of 433,910 marks ($103,270). 
It was natural that shortly after the transfer spoken of—at 
time when everything in this extensive field of action was still 
flux and fermentation, and the new administration had yet to de

the principles according to which itself and its subordinate authorities 
should proceed, since practical tests alone could prove whether what 
was planned in the office would fit the actual ‘conditions—there 
should have been a strong tendency toward centralization. Only 
after the aims and methods of the various institutions had been 
defined in accordance with the views of expert industrial leaders, 
after the principles and course of preparation of teachers had been 
declared, and the participation of the communities and other corpo- 
ations in the administration of the schools had been clearly defined, 
nd industrial councilors acting as expert advisers for each pro- 
incial government had been appointed, could the centralization be 
elaxed and the many inconveniences be removed which were at the 
eginning sorely felt in consequence of the inevitable, strong cen- 
ralization of the administration. 
The administration of commerce and industry, faithful to the 
rogramme it had prepared beforehand, was determined to take no 
teps without securing the advice of authoritative experts from 
rades, factories, and business firms in directing the local adminis- 
ration of the schools. First a commission for vocational schools 
as appointed, whose special object it was to collect such advice. 
his commission, however, was not homogeneous and too large for 
lhe purpose intended; consequently it met but seldom. It has since 
een replaced by a number of advisory industrial councilors, who 
eriodically meet and offer suggestions to the Central Office and to 
e minister concerning the exigencies arising in the various labor 
enters. As a result of these deliberations misunderstandings and 
ncertain orders have been prevented and the Central Administration 
as received many valuable suggestions. 
It is especially important that the local boards and trustees of the 
arious schools should have members, as their articles of incorpora- 
on prescribe, who are expert industrialists representing the trades 
d occupations which the respective schools are to serve, so that 
schools may duly consider the needs of practical life in their 
urses of study and methods of teaching. 
To increase the number of agents of the ministerial administration 
the seat of provincial governments, and to affiliate with them 
pert assistance, are pressing needs of the near future. 
However satisfactory the development during the last 25 years 
ay appear, much remains to be done. An urgent necessity seems 
be the further improvement of the continuation schools. . The 
0,000 pupils of such evening and secular Sunday schools in Prussia 
cluding about 50,000 pupils in rural or agricultural schools) repre- 
nt in a course of three years about 140,000 new pupils a year. 
t the 6,400,000 pupils of the elementary and advanced rural and 
y schools of the State have an army of recruits of 800,000 pupils a

   year. This proves that only 18 per cent of all young folks of the ages 
for continuation schools (between the 14th and 17th years of age) are 
attending such schools. Another fact deserves attention, namely, 
that the 300 graduates of mechanical engineering and machine build- 
ing in the technological universities this year will find only 875 
graduates of the secondary or middle machine-building schools to 
assist them, while experience shows that at least ten times that numbe! 
of young men, technically prepared in middle schools, can be utilize 
in the labor market of the nation. The total number of male yout! 
in elementary and advanced elementary schools in eight yearl, 
courses, viz, 3,200,000, if compared with the total number of student 
in secondary vocational schools in two yearly courses, viz, 40,000. 
and which in the eight yearly courses would at least be 160,000, 
shows plainly how necessary is the further development and exten: 
sion of the vocational school system. 
CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
Equally iraportant with the increase in the number of technical 
schools and the augmentation of their funds for the success of th 
whole system is the improvement in the equipment and inner organ| 
ization of the continuation schools. The Central Administration ha 
been very active in this direction. For continuation schools the orde 
of the minister of worship and education of January 14, 1884, remaine 
authoritative after the transfer took place in 1885. It decreed th 
by far the greatest number of continuation schools are to be regarde: 
as repetition schools, in which all the branches of the elementar 
schools should be treated and extended if possible; intimate conne 
tion with the urgent demands of practical life was not attempte 
Attendance at such schools was mostly voluntary, and according] 
very irregular; a well-planned course [laid out in years and terms] w: 
generally wanting. The older, far-reaching ministerial demand 
1874, namely, that the continuation schools should, as a rule, be op 
at least for 16 hours a week, was found impracticable. Therefo: 
the order of January 14, 1884, reduced the number of hours per we: 
to 4 or 6 and limited the chief branches of instruction to moth 
tongue, arithmetic, and drawing. 
Upon this basis rules and regulations, dated July 5, 1897, for layi 
out local courses of study and prescribing the method of instructio 
were framed for the two branches of study—-mother tongue ai 
arithmetic. These rules demanded that the matter of instructi 
should preferably be chosen from practical pursuits and civil li 
it should serve the living and vocational interests of the students, ta’ 
into consideration the local industrial conditions and promote ri 
gious feeling and love of country. The merit of such courses of stu 
may be found in the fact that they confined themselves to that whij

PRUSSIAN SYSTEM OF VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS. 309 
was possible; that is, set up standards which could be applied to 
smaller [ungraded] schools. The continuation school [so far as it is 
not purely vocational] is one of four grades; the number of hours per 
per week is 6—2 for German, 2 for arithmetic, geometry, and book- 
keeping, and 2 for drawing. Minute regulations concerning methods 
of teaching German and arithmetic were designedly omitted, but 
further development was encouraged and left to voluntary initiative. 
This development took place, especially when the schools with vol- 
untary attendance were gradually replaced by schools with compul- 
sory attendance, in consequence of paragraph 120 of the new indus- 
trial law (Gewerbe-Ordnung). That change resulted in regular attend- 
ance and made it possible to carry into effect well-planned courses 
of study. Also better hours were appointed for the evening schools 
in many localities upon the urgent solicitation of the minister. The 
minister of commerce used the full weight of his authority in favor of 
schools with compulsory attendance, and stated officially that he 
would subsidize new continuation schools only if the communities 
should decree compulsory attendance. Thus he succeeded in inducing 
the large cities, one after another, to introduce a system of compulsory 
schools. In 1900 Magdeburg gave the example; Frankfurt on the 
Main followed; then the Rhenish-Westphalian factory towns; and, 
lastly, in 1905, Berlin adopted the plan. In the spring of 1910 Essen 
will be the only large city lacking industrial continuation schools 
with compulsory attendance. 
The extension of the continuation school system of large cities 
makes it necessary to appoint expert supervisors, principals, and 
teachers, and to provide for separate school buildings. The con- 
tinuation school system is developing into a system independent of 
the general school system. This is shown by the subjects of instruc- 
tion. The large number of students enables the authorities to 
segregate them according to vocations or occupations. Vocational 
drawing lessons can be introduced; instruction in the mother tongue 
may take the form of compositions on vocations and lessons in 
civics, touching intimately the actual relations of trades and occupa- 
tions. Commercial continuation schools also develop, frequently 
with the cooperation of chambers of commerce and business associa- 
tions, into technical schools of a lower grade, which place in the center 
f instruction business correspondence, commercial arithmetic, and 
eography, as well as business practice. New problems arise from 
e fact that unskilled laborers are drawn into the sphere of school 
uence. The subjects of study for such persons are chosen, above 
ll, from labor and transportation conditions of the home province, 
ith lessons in hygiene and decorous deportment, as well as informa- 
jon concerning civic duties and economic welfare. The subject-

   their students according to occupations is similarly arranged; but all 
pay attention to local conditions and the special needs of the promi- 
nent trades of the towns. 
The former courses of study have become antiquated through this 
development. Hence new courses have been prepared and will be 
officially ordered for adoption in the course of the year 1910. Asa 
result of careful consideration, new principles for the subject of draw- 
ing were approved by an order of January 28, 1907. These princi- 
ples aim ‘at a purely vocational evolution of that important branch. 
Drawing in the continuation school has, during the last decades, 
dropped the former customary esthetic object and has become 
sketching and drafting as a practical aid to the various vocations. 
While formerly drawing of geometrical bodies and mathematical 
measuring were the centers of that branch of study, and later, draw- 
ing of ornaments received more attention and time, while vocational 
drawing (so-called working-drawings) did not come in before the 
second half of the course, now, according to the new principles 
adopted, working-drawings and sketches are the basis of the whole 
instruction in drawing. 
At present the continuation school is the most important educa- 
tional institution for young apprentices and wage-earners. It alone 
can fill the gap between the elementary school age and service in the 
army and exercise an educational influence over the young during 
the time of adolescence. Hence it seems called upon not only to act 
directly through instruction, but also to furnish the foundation for 
other institutions for the training of the young; it has become a 
necessity in large cities. 
The great importance of the continuation school (evening school) 
for the entire education of the people of Prussia makes it appear most 
desirable to create a legal foundation for this system, such as most 
of the south and central German States have. A continuation| 
school law, which makes it a duty of Prussian cities of 10,000 inhab-| 
itants to establish and maintain such a system of schools, is in| 
preparation. 
VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS FOR GIRLS. 
The industrial schools for girls formerly presented a very mixe 
appearance. Their course of instruction was not laid out accordin; 
to plan, but was fitted to the various purposes of the pupils. No: 
was a distinct aim prescribed; consequently, neither in regard to th 
branches of study nor to the hours of study per week, nor to the dura 
tion of the course, were any definite rules in force. Gradually som 
of the schools, supported and directed by efficient societies, aban- 
doned this free and easy mode of procedure and adopted a mo: 
pedagogic organization and management. The results accomplishe
-P-A-G-E-319
  PRUSSIAN SYSTEM OF VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS. 311 
in such schools led to the adoption of regular courses of study in three 
state institutions, to wit, in Posen, Rheydt, and Potsdam, to which 
lately has been added the school at Thorn. The entire matter of 
instruction was divided into separate and ascending courses, and the 
length of each fitted to the difficulties of the separate branches. If 
a student wished to be admitted to the middle or higher grades, it 
was necessary for her to prove that she was in possession of sufficient 
knowledge and skill of the matters taught in the lower grades. This 
provision secured a more uniform preparation of the classes and the 
accomplishment of more uniform results of the prescribed courses. 
The organization of the girls’ vocational schools is planned as fol- 
lows: Young women who wish to become familiar with the duties of 
housewives must enter the department of domestic science. Here 
they are taught, according to a fixed plan, cooking, washing, ironing, 
various work required in a household, and the supplementary arts of 
economy, including the keeping of books for household expenses; 
also, simple handiwork, such as sewing, patching, darning, mending, 
and machine sewing; lastly, they are taught hygiene, nursing of 
children and invalids. After the completion of this course the stu- 
dent may acquire more thorough improvement in the main branches 
in separately arranged postgraduate courses. To these special 
courses other students, not having had the benefit of the general 
courses outlined above, are not admitted unless they can prove, to 
the satisfaction of the authorities, that they possess the knowledge 
and skill required to pursue the advanced special courses. Thus, for 
instance, no student is admitted to the course in making under- 
clothes if she lacks the accomplishment of plain sewing, and no one is 
admitted to the course of tailoring who lacks skill in machine sew- 
ing. Almost all middle and advanced institutions for girls’ voca- 
tional education have adapted themselves to this organization. The 
practical results have contributed much to the gratifying develop- 
ment of these institutions. 
The foregoing is applicable, so far, only to the purely vocational 
schools—that is, those in which the students have instruction in day 
time for a considerable number of hours per week. These practices 
have not as yet been adopted in elementary continuation or evening 
schools for girls, though they are primarily intended for those who 
become wage-earners at an early age. Here much of the work is 
still subject to the individual wishes of the people, who otherwise 
would simply not allow their daughters to attend. It is astonishing 
that among the working population there is such a strong disinclina- 
tion to regulations and systematic instruction. Continuation schools 
which have an approved organization and management, are not usu- 
ally attended by wage-earning girls, but by the daughters of parents 
belonging to other social classes; yet the former need instruction in

the various household arts more than any others. In this regard no 
change can be’expected unless the attendance at these schools is made 
compulsory. That such compulsion would be beneficial is fully 
proved by the commercial continuation schools, the aim of which is 
preparation for business and office work, and which instruct accord- 
ing to fixed courses of study. 
SCHOOLS OF INDUSTRIAL ARTS AND TRADES. 
The number of secondary schools devoted to industrial arts and 
trades in 1884, at the time of the transfer already noted to the min- 
istry of commerce, was 19. Of these, a few have been abandoned. 
The list for 1909 contains 41 such institutions, which illustrates the 
extensive growth of industrial art and trade instruction during the 
last 25 years. Still more remarkable is the change that has taken 
place in the internal organization and management of the schools. 
Of these institutions it may be said that they are a new creation dur- 
ing these 25 years, for nothing like them existed before. The time 
previous to 1884 was marked by industrial drawing schools—that is, 
institutions in which a trade worker learned the drafting more or less 
necessary in his particular trade. Side by side with these drawing 
schools there were in existence a few vocational schools fitted for 
certain manufactories and designed for the special purpose of pro- 
moting certain local industries. Real industrial art schools, schools 
of design with vocational lessons in daytime, were not anywhere in 
existence in Germany. 
At about the middle of the eighth decade a new type of trade and. 
industrial art school began to take shape in Prussia, and at the close 
of the century the present form of such schools developed rapidly. 
This effective change had its origin in the evening schools devoted to 
trade drawing, which schools, feeling the pulse of the time, took on a 
more and more vocational character. Certain occupations required 
a change from evening classes to day schools for more advanced 
workers. It also became necessary to consider the wishes of those 
who meant to devote some years to their vocational improvement as 
designers, model draftsmen, pattern-makers, etc. The fusion of 
purely trade education, such as is offered in evening drawing school 
and vocational classes of trade schools, with the more artistic instruc: 
tion offered in day classes in schools of design, is a characteristi 
feature of development in Germany. This fusion insures a natural 
selection of more talented students, and makes it possible for th 
buildings and means of instruction of one institution to serve bo 
purposes. 
~The change in artistic taste which began about 1895, and w: 
recognized not only in Germany, but more or less in all Europe: 
countries, has affected the instruction in trade schools and industri
-P-A-G-E-321
  
PRUSSIAN SYSTEM OF VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS. 313 
art schools. The change was marked by the partial abandonment 
of the study of conventionalized historic ornament and its replace- 
ment by thorough nature study, which latter is to-day the basis of 
the entire instruction in ornamentation. From that comes recog- 
nition of the necessity of supplementing the work on the drawing- 
board by work in materials, in order to arrive at more purposeful 
and realistic forms. This recognition has led to the establishment 
of school workshops (the need of which had been urged by Gottfried 
Semper in his first programme of industrial art education as early 
as 1851, and the establishment of which had repeatedly been called 
for in memorials by commissions of experts). The workshops have 
become, since then, an integral part of all Prussian industrial art and 
trade schools. They have extended and deepened their courses of 
study by adding the training of the hand; above all, they have 
exercised a perceptible influence upon the erection of new school- 
uildings, for in the old ones a combination of drafting rooms and 
orkshops could not always be arranged. 
In large cities in which the continuation schools may be easily 
ivided into many departments it has been observed that after the 
rawing lessons have become vocational in their form and subject- 
atter, the elementary continuation schools take over a part of the 
ork intended for the evening classes of trade schools. This is plain 
rom the decrease in the attendance of such evening trade classes. 
ence arises the need of new plans of organization for the future; 
fact, the whole field of industrial art and trade schools is still in a 
rocess of evolution and hence a final regulation of the system is as 
et impossible. 
     
   
                         
     
    
        
   
   
     
             
    
   
    SCHOOLS FOR THE BUILDING TRADES. 
When the administration of secondary schools for the building 
ades was transferred to the ministry of commerce there were 
mly 7 institutions of this kind in existence in Prussia, and every 
ear a large number of young workers engaged in the building trades 
ere denied admission. The first object of the administration was 
erefore to increase the number of schools and to extend those 
ready established. The state subsidies for the support of existing 
thools were therefore increased; more advantageous conditions 
an heretofore were offered to cities intending to establish new 
hools for the building trades; and finally, when these inducements 
ere not sufficient to obviate the difficulties, the state authorities 
adually took into their hands the schools already existing and 
duced communal governments to join hands with the State in the 
ection of new schools. The results were an increase in the number 
schools to 24, the organization of courses of ten grades, and 
increase of students from 1,000 in 1885 to 9,000 in 1908. The

         number of students who had to be denied admittance was thu: 
reduced to a minimum. This vigorous development of the syste 
was made possible by increasing the State’s quota for its suppor 
from 88,000 marks ($19,040) to 1,500,000 marks ($357,000), or ai 
increase from 85 marks ($20.23) per capita of the students in 188 
to 166 marks ($39.51) in 1908. The cities increased their quot 
to even larger amounts, and in recent years the largest cities of th 
Kingdom have defrayed one-half of ail the expenses, or all expens 
not covered by tuition fees and state subsidies. 
The inner organization and management kept step with th 
increase in the number of schools and their departments. A some 
what uniform organization of this kind of schools had already, at th 
date of transfer in 1884, been secured by the establishment of fou 
ascending grades, through a governmental order of examinatio 
which dated from 1882. Still the courses of study of the separat 
schools showed essential deviations, so that transfer from one instit’ 
tion to an advanced grade of another school was extremely difficul 
if not impossible. Therefore, in 1898, a normal or uniform course 
study was prescribed, although only in outlines, for all the schoo! 
for the building trades; and to secure results as uniform as possibl 
considering the often greatly differing standard of preparation of t 
students, uniform conditions of admission were officially prescribe 
Together with the issuing of a normal course of study, a measu 
was taken which for the development of this school system h: 
proved of great importance. It was this: The surface improveme 
branches (Tiefbauficher) had hitherto found no attention, thou 
many graduates were already engaged in hydraulic works and rail 
road building service, in city surface improvements, and in roa 
bridge, and tunnel building. It was therefore determined that t! 
schools for the building trades in Posen and Miinster should op 
such courses for students who had already passed through two yea! 
practical study of architecture. The students should devote t 
remaining two years to the essential branches of surface improv} 
ment (hydraulic works, road building, bridge and railroad buildin; 
How far this new. arrangement met the existing needs is seen fro} 
the large number of applications for admission to the classes offeri 
that kind of instruction. Year after year it became necessary 
arrange new courses, so that at present all schools for the buildi 
trades, except the one in Eckernférde,* have such departmen 
The increase in the number of students from 30 in 1900 to abo 
1,500 in 1908 proves that many students, previous to the openi 
of such departments, had to be satisfied with an altogether insu 
cient preparation for their future calling. 
aTn the province of Schleswig-Holstein the school at Rendsburg teaches only the branches of su! 
improvement, while that at Eckernférde only the branches of architecture.
-P-A-G-E-323
  PRUSSIAN SYSTEM OF VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS. 815 
The ministerial order which changed the courses of study of 
schools for the building trades affected also the prescribed examina- 
tions. The order of 1882, which was changed provisionally at first but 
efinitely in 1902, reduced the number of days for written examina- 
ions from 18 to 8, and gave daily classwork a decided influence upon 
jhe examination marks. 
Although in consequence of the new order of examinations an 
xtension of the time for instruction was secured, immediately after 
he adoption of the normal course of study the opinion was expressed 
hat not even the most talented students could do full justice to the 
mount of subject-matter prescribed and that the vast require- 
ents would demand too much home work. These complaints 
esulted in a thorough investigation and in the preparation of a new 
ourse by the Central Industrial Office, which prescribed a term of 
ve semesters. After this course had been submitted to, and dis- 
ussed by, expert teachers and men of affairs especially interested in 
Ihe schools for builders, it was finally adopted in the fall of 1908. 
in the deliberations concerning the best organization of this kind of 
truction, not only the duration. of the course, but also the extent 
ff the subject-matter of instruction, received attention, especially 
e relation between esthetic and constructive instruction and its 
ethods, and consequently a thorough reorganization of the entire 
ork of the schools for the building trades took place. In consider- 
tion of the fact that the technical men who construct by far the 
eatest number of buildings in cities and in the country had come 
‘om the schools for builders, much weight was given to the esthetic 
ucation of the students. The order in which the subject-matter 
instruction was arranged resulted in the possibility of benefiting also 
ose students whose capacity and means precluded graduation from 
e completed course or whose future vocation would not require them 
go through the entire course of five winters. Such students are 
abled now to take up the application of their architectural knowl- 
ge and skill after two or three winters and without having fully 
mpleted their departmental course. 
The fact that architectural instruction (Hochbau) may be dis- 
mtinued after three winter sessions makes it possible in the two 
per grades to pay particular attention to surface building and 
provements (Tiefbau), and to make the course in that department 
lore thorough. In order to utilize these schools for the building 
lades for ever widening circles it will be of importance, if possible, 
open Sunday and evening classes in all the existing schools.

SCHOOLS FOR METAL WORKERS. 
     
       
    
   
   
      
    
    
    
   
    
    
       
    
    
   
   In a similar manner, and no less successfully, the schools for th 
metal industries have developed during the past 25 years. In thi 
field the Central Industrial Office met with two problems, when th| 
transfer of vocational schools took place: How to separate th 
technical classes of high schools having realistic tendencies (so-calle: 
Realschulen) and change them to independent institutions, and ho 
to increase the number of schools for metal workers to meet t 
needs of the metal industries. The first task was completed whe 
the secondary machine builders’ school in Aachen was establishe 
in 1902. The increase in the number of institutions of that ki 
was gradual during the last decade of the nineteenth and the fi 
decade of the twentieth century, so that at present there are 
metal workers’ schools (21 of them independent), with 115 classe} 
while in 1884 there existed only 10 such institutions, with 24 classe 
In accord with the wishes of the local boards of trustees of t 
separate institutions representing local manufacturing interests, 
has always been recognized that the aims of these schools, which a: 
intended for the lower or middle class of workers, should not 
placed too high; especially all approach to the polytechnical univ: 
sities should be avoided; they should remain monotechnical in sco 
This principle was not only kept in view in the regulations issued 
1901, but is constantly adhered to in the deliberations concerning| 
still later reorganization now going on. 
In the establishment of monotechnical schools for metal industri 
the Central Office has insisted upon the principle that such scho 
should be opened only in locations having adequate factories, a 
that in provinces lacking metal industries no such schools w 
necessary. Experience has proved that the establishment of su 
schools is always an outcome of a flourishing industry, such as cutle 
locksmithing, or machine building. Such a school, then, is opened 
prepare the required skilled laborers in large numbers, but it ne 
calls into life a new industry, nor preserves the life of a dying indust: 
In accordance with the varying needs of different industries, 
vocational schools for metal workers have developed a variety 
forms. Thus, at present, there are, besides the machine build 
schools, one secondary school for the building of- ships and shi 
engines, two smelting schools, three schools for the cutlery and ot 
small metal industries, one school for the bronze industry, one copp 
smiths’ school, and one school for electrical mechanicians. 
establishment of a school for electrical installation is now un 
consideration. 
The Central Industrial Office has paid much attention to 
social object of the schools for the metal industries. For that rea: 
it interests itseif particularly in machine builders’ schools requii

for the admission of students, besides a practical shop experience of 
several years, only an elementary education, and its interest is directed 
also to evening and Sunday schools and special courses affiliated with 
machine builders’ schools. 
Through these machine builders’ schools [schools of mechanical 
engineering, as some may be called] it is intended to improve young 
men who must earn the money for tuition fees by the work of their 
hands in shops and factories. This is also in the interest of the 
factories, for experience shows that the graduates of these schools 
become most useful workers. Factory owners who, for a time, 
showed little sympathy for these schools are much more friendly to ° 
them now that conviction of their usefulness spreads. The evening 
and Sunday classes, as well as the special limited courses, are intended 
chiefly for young metal workers who can not afford to spend many 
hours in day schools. They are of use not only to those who attend 
them, but also to the industry in general, since they increase the 
number of skilled laborers. That is the reason why the evening and 
Sunday classes and special limited courses have increased their 
attendance so largely in recent years. In future, these considera- 
tions will be decisive in the further growth of the system of schools 
for metal workers. 
        
     
                        
   
   
            
     
    
     SCHOOLS FOR THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY. 
Instruction in textile schools was conducted for a long time differ- 
ently from that offered in other vocational schools. It consisted 
chiefly of free lectures and exercises, and the teachers rarely deter- 
mined by examinations whether their lessons were successful or not. 
The teachers imitated university professors, but for such methods 
the students were too immature. For that reason, during the last 
decade of the past century new courses of study and rules were 
formulated, which guaranteed earnest and diligent study and work 
ion the part of the students. Graduation examinations were pre- 
cribed also, in which it was necessary for teachers and students to 
rove that the prescribed objects in view had been reached. Hand 
in hand with this change went the establishment of separate courses 
‘or workmen, foremen, and superintendents and factory owners. 
‘or the practical education of workmen shops for weavers were 
stablished; for foremen, secondary technical textile schools; and for 
uperintendents and factory owners, higher schools, which taught all 
he branches of the textileindustry. Naturally, the latter courses were 
pened also to foremen, and even to ordinary laborers, if they were 
apable of following them. A separation of vocations further led to 
he inauguration of courses for model draftsmen, merchants, etc. 
Experience finally proved indisputably that it was not’ possible to 
each all the branches and bearings of the vastly extensive textile

     industry in a single school. Neither was it possible to obtain teachers 
who possessed the knowledge of every textile branch, nor could a 
school be conducted successfully if it attempted to cover such a vast 
amount of work. Hence special schools were established for the 
cotton, wool, linen, and silk industries. These schools did not 
confine themselves, however, to teaching weaving, but each under- 
took to teach also spinning, dyeing, finishing, lace making, ribbon 
weaving, machine knitting, and finally all the numerous bearings of 
its branch. In consequence of this policy it is to-day possible in 
Prussia to have represented every branch of the textile industry in 
schools, to equip the latter with good shops, machines, and raw 
materials, and to provide thorough, expert teachers for the staff. 
COURSES FOR TRADE MASTERS. 
The range of influence of the Central Industrial Office has only 
lately been extended by the realization of a plan to supplement the 
vocational education of the young people devoted to industry by 
opening opportunities for older workmen, as well as independent 
shop and factory owners, to fill gaps in their vocational preparation, 
to familiarize them with new technical inventions, and to keep step 
with the ever occurring changes in their trades. 
These attempts at arranging trade-master courses, the necessit; 
or desirability of which was readily recognized by the Central In- 
dustrial Office, became more necessary soon after the passing of th 
so-called labor law (Gewerbe-Ordnung) of 1897; and, with the willin, 
cooperation of the legislative bodies, the first institution devoted t 
trade-master courses was opened in Hanover in 1900. A powerful im: 
pulse in that direction was given by the adoption of a resolution i 
the House of Deputies, on June 4, 1902, proposed by Deputy Trimborn 
In the course of the following year other similar institutions wer 
opened in several provinces, most of them having their own room: 
and shops. Their number at present is nine, including one which i 
to be opened this year. 
These courses aim at the technical and commercial improvement 0 
laborers and shop masters who have been actively occupied in theij 
branches of industry for years; they are not confined to master] 
alone, however, but they also admit dependent laborers, so-calle 
trade journeymen, who are preparing themselves for higher or i 
dependent positions. The instruction consists of connected lectur| 
courses and exercises extending over a number of weeks, according t 
a plan which affords a variety of shopwork and technical draftin, 
theoretical and practical lessons. Attendance at these courses 
made possible to laborers who lose their wages for absenting the: 
selves from their occupations by the payment of small subsidi 
from the state treasury.
-P-A-G-E-327
  
PRUSSIAN SYSTEM OF VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS. 819 
In order to give tradesmen who are not in a position to interrupt 
their wage-earning occupations an opportunity to acquire knowledge 
of bockkeeping and the making of estimates of cost for work in their 
own branches, there have been arranged so-called brief master 
courses, often in connection with the above-mentioned courses, 
which may be attended conveniently after work hours, in the after- 
noon or in the evening. The chambers of commerce in many cities 
have instituted such brief courses with the aid of the State. Fre- 
quently such highly practical brief master courses are affiliated with 
vocational schools supported by the State or by societies; especially 
is this done if the courses are of a technical character, the real practical 
nature of which is promoted much by the teachers, collections, and 
shops of the technical institutions that offer these courses. 
In order that so-called small shop or factory owners might. have 
opportunities to inform themselves of improvements in technical 
aids, tools, power, and working machines, and to familiarize them- 
selves with modern labor and methods of production, there have been 
arranged for such purposes, in some localities, temporary and per- 
manent exhibitions in. which machines are in running order, and 
where raw materials and half-finished productions are shown. In 
some places these exhibitions are installed in rented quarters; in 
others permanent exposition buildings or halls have been erected. 
At present, three such permanent exhibitions are in existence, two 
of them having their own halls. These institutions also have been 
supported financially by the Central Industrial Office. They were 
called into life, as a rule, through the initiative of city, provincial, 
and county governments. 
For the eight full courses for trade masters there was provided in 
the annual appropriations of 1900-1908 a total of 767,698 marks 
($182,712). For the short courses for trade masters, usually ar- 
anged by local chambers of commerce, a total of 40,790 marks 
($9,868) were spent by the State alone from 1903 to 1908, and for 
rade master courses connected with technical schools the sum of 
2,261 marks ($7,678) was spent by the State during the period from 
904 to 1908. The Central Office aided the local exhibition halls with 
he sum of 142,246 marks ($33,855) during the period from 1903 to 
908. 
The institutions named were not the only ones aided by the Central 
ndustrial Office. This office extended its activity (besides the pro- 
otion of small shop and factory labor) over the system of examina- 
ions for journeymen and apprentices and exhibitions of the work 
f such laborers. During the period 1903 to 1908 such exhibitions 
equired an expenditure of 20,844 marks ($4,961), and for tradesmens’ 
nd industrial exhibitions, during the same period, the sum of 
3,970 marks ($12,848) was expended by the State.

The total expenditure of the ministry of commerce and industry 
for industrial education and promotion of labor, especially in the 
interests ‘of the middle classes, rose from 965,951 marks ($229,896) in 
1885 to 13.118,525 marks ($3,122,189) in 1910, as has been stated

   TEACHERS OF VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS. 
One of the most important and at the same time most difficult 
tasks of the Central Industrial Office in aiding the development of 
the state system of vocational industrial instruction was to pro- 
cure suitable teachers. But it was evident that the means must first 
be provided to induce persons to accept teachers’ positions who were 
not only theoretically schooled, but were also familiar with the prac 
tical side of industrial life. Such persons were rare, and hence th 
authorities had to see to it that all such teachers were adequatel 
prepared; to that end they established fixed standards for tha 
preparation as well as for the internal management of the schools. 
With the exception of a few principals of municipal drawing an 
industrial schools, of technical schools for weavers, and the principal 
of the state school for the building trades at Nienburg, there were| 
in 1885, only a few teachers of the last-named institution appointe 
for life with a claim upon a pension. Their average salary amounte 
to only 3,150 marks ($750); that of the other teachers in schools fo 
the building trades was 2,810 marks ($669). In other monotechnic: 
schools the pay of teachers was even lower. It was considered 
great step forward when the average salary of teachers of school 
for builders (for teachers of this kind of schools was the salary fir: 
regulated) was increased to 3,150 marks ($750), and that of th 
principals to 5,000 marks ($1,190). To-day not only the principal 
-(now termed directors) and teachers of the schools wholly supporte) 
by the State, but all the teachers of city vocational schools a: 
appointed for life at better salaries and with a claim upon a pensio 
for themselves as well as for their widows and orphans. Teachers 
vocational schools, supported wholly by the State, having universi 
education, receive also either a dwelling or adequate cash compens 
tion for rent in absence of a suitable dwelling, and a salary whi 
begins with 3,000 marks ($715) and is increased within 21 years 
7,200 marks ($1,715). The same maximum is reached by princip 
after 9 years, having begun with 5,400 marks ($1,285); these pri 
cipals receive also a communal supplementary pay of 600 mar 
($133), which sum is included when the pension claim is computed. 
The teachers of the monotechnical schools for metal workers w 
have not a complete university education and the teachers of stal 
industrial art schools begin with a salary of 3,000 marks ($715) ai 
rise to 6,000 marks ($1,430) in 18 years. In vocational institutio

   supported chiefly by cities or corporations and which are only sub- 
sidized by the State, the salaries are being increased in a similar 
manner, especially the salaries of teachers in trade schools and schools 
-of design, who up to this year received 2,700 to 4,800 marks ($643 to 
$1,042), are placed on the same scale of 3,000 to 6,000 marks ($715 
to $1,430). 
It is important for the standing of teachers of vocational schools 
and for the uplift of the teaching profession that, in consequence of 
a royal order of January 27, 1898, the relations of titles and rank 
have been regulated like those of similar officers of the State; natu- 
rally the order dealt, first, with the principals and teachers of state 
institutions. The principals of such schools received the official 
title ‘‘Director” with the rank of councillors of the fifth class, and the 
prospect of promotion to the fourth class, upon motion of the min- 
ister. Teachers with full university preparation received the title 
“Head teacher’? (Oberlehrer) with the rank of councillors of the 
fifth class. This order also provides that. one-third of the total 
number of such teachers may receive the title of ‘‘Professor.” After 
12 years of service they may be proposed for the fourth class of 
councillors. 
By royal order of January 27, 1906, the titles and rank of the 
principals and teachers of trade schools and industrial art schools 
subsidized by the State, and those of the higher technical schools 
for the textile branches, were similarly regulated. According to 
hat order the title of professor may be conferred on such teachers 
ithout the presupposition of full university preparation. It was 
urther decreed that henceforth one-half of the number of head 
eachers of the schools for the building and machine building trades 
ay be promoted to the rank of professor. 
The difficulty of giving the various classes of vocational teachers 
edagogic training has been only partly overcome. The training 
f the younger class of vocational teachers, namely, for girls’ indus- 
rial schools, has progressed furthest according to strict rules. The 
teadily increasing importance of the system of girls’ industrial 
chools, and the very rapid development of continuation and sec- 
ndary vocational schools for young ladies, caused the lack of oppor- 
unities for carefully planned preparation of women for the teaching 
rofession to be felt more than in other institutions; hence, an order 
as issued on January 23, 1907, according to which a normal depart- 
ent should be established in connection with all schools of domestic 
cience and art subsidized by the State; the order, likewise, regu- 
ted the course of study of such departments. 
In schools for the building trades and for machine building (mechan- 
al engineering schools) no special arrangements for the prepa-

   ration of the teaching personnel have so far been made. Neither 
the establishment of normal departments for the professional prepa- 
ration of such teachers, nor a system of examinations by which 
proof of the required knowledge and accomplishments could be. 
given, has been possible. The expense was not the only deterring 
cause. It did not seem advisable to create institutions for a limited 
demand; for, after once the average number of teachers had been 
reached, the building trades and mechanical engineering, suffering 
first in times of industrial depression, might not for years require the 
teachers prepared for these branches, for whose professional educa- 
tion it was necessary to expend time and money. 
This does not, however, imply utter neglect of the professional 
training of young teachers in these two classes of schools. Of any 
teachers to be newly appointed, it is required that they possess a 
higher education (either obtained in a university or in a polytechnic 
institute); especially, that they have adequate experience in indus- 
trial practice. For the further professional education of such 
teachers means have been appropriated and opportunities opened 
(1) by stipends for study-trips to other cities, (2) by grants of annual 
leaves, with pay, for the same purpose, and (3) by permission to engage 
in private occupations. Further, it is proposed to utilize the summer 
semesters more than hitherto for the professional preparation off 
young teachers; similar plans have been laid for teachers of mechan: 
ical engineering and machine building. 
In schools of industrial art and in trade schools, the need of furthe 
education for the teachers has become most strongly felt. Here th 
teachers, to be successful, must preserve an aptitude for new accom 
plishments and keep in touch with artistic life. For that, however. 
opportunities are often lacking in small cities. Such teachers nee 
to become familiar with new fields of activity in industrial art an 
design for which their work in school does not give them the require 
time. In order to meet this need a number of courses of instructio: 
for teachers in different fields of industrial art were arranged durin, 
the last few years; thus, for instance, by Architect Riemerschmid 
in Munich, who dealt with designs of furniture and interior archi 
tecture; in flat ornamentation at the industrial art and trade scho 
in Magdeburg; in lettering at the school of design in Diisseldorf unde} 
Professor Behrens; in mural painting and decorating for teachers o 
technical classes under direction of Professor Mohrbutter in Cha: 
lottenburg; and finally a course in mural decoration under Professo 
Hammel in Hanover; also the courses in plant designs in 1901 an 
1902, and those in 1909, conducted by Professor Meurer in Rom 
Italy, and in Berlin, which were attended by 50 Prussian teache: 
and directors, may be classed among the efforts toward improveme 
of teachers of industrial art schools.

   This improvement of teachers was promoted further by stipends 
granted by State and communities to schools of that kind for teach- 
ers’ journeys of study. Similar journeys were encouraged by sti- 
pends for the improvement of teachers of the textile branches. 
TEACHERS OF CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
For no other schools, however, is the professional preparation of 
teachers so urgent and of such importance as for the continuation 
schools. In these [evening and Sunday] schools, owing to lack of 
teachers, the instruction in drawing was necessarily intrusted in 
small towns to teachers of the people’s (or elementary) schools, who 
were seldom sufficiently prepared for general instruction in that 
branch, much less even for technical drawing. In the continuation 
schools, therefore, the instruction was successful only when the teach- 
lers were specially prepared to give drawing lessons, both free-hand 
land technical, at least to a limited extent. When the continuation 
chool system was transferred to the ministry of commerce and 
industry, one of its first steps was to advance the preparation of 
eachers of these schools. During the period 1886 to 1894, profes- 
ional drawing courses were arranged in Berlin, Diisseldorf, and Han- 
ver, for which the sum of 18,000 marks ($4,284) was set aside 
nnually, and by which 400 teachers were benefited. But in con 
equence of the steadily growing number of continuation schools, 
t became necessary to increase these courses; finally, other courses 
or commercial instruction, for language and arithmetic, were added, 
o that in 1905 the sum needed for these purposes amounted annu- 
lly to 130,000 marks ($30,940), and at present the sum spent is 
00,000 marks ($47,600). The number of teachers employed in con- 
inuation schools rose to 11,517 in 1904, of whom 549 were employed 
day schools and necessarily severed their connection with the ele- 
entary schools. The necessity of doing something to prepare teach- 
rs, both for evening and day continuation schools, increases in 
rgency, and to obtain the required personnel, not only teachers of 
llementary schools who have a normal-school training and need only 
dditional technical knowledge of vocations and their many ramifica- 
ons, but also skilled workmen in a variety of industries, are em- 
loyed, who require professional school practice to handle classes and 
teach according to pedagogic principles. 
Therefore, to decide upon the best course in this respect, and to 
rocure teachers for other vocational and secondary schools as well; 
rthermore, to attend to the ever increasing opportunities for peda- 
gical and technical education of young people intending to devote 
emselves entirely to industrial education, and to promote all other 
titutions tending to the support and improvement of the indus-

@ After K. Knabe, Das deutsche Unterrichtswesen der Gegenwart. Though this table is some years old, 
it affords a view of the great variety of schools in existence.     PART IIl—ORGANIZATION OF VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS IN PRUSSIA,    
  I. Schoots ror THE Burtpine TRADES.    
  (a) OBJECT AND ORGANIZATION.           The schools for the building trades are throughout vocational, 
mtended to prepare (1) laborers for the building trades who aim 
o become independent contractors, as masons, carpenters, stone 
asons; such schools offer opportunities for the acquisition of 
heoretical knowledge and accomplishments in drafting and designing 
nd necessary requisites for the independent practice of the trades; 
2) to prepare for architecture and work of surface improvement 
Tiefbau), bureau draftsmen and designers, as well as building 
oremen; (3) to prepare for provincial, county, and communal 
dministrations, officers employed in governmental, military, railroad, 
nd city building or surface improvement. 
       
   
       
           
      
   
-P-A-G-E-338
   
   
                                                                                         330 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
In these schools the foundation is laid for official careers, such as 
those of architectural secretaries, inspectors, and superintendents for 
the erection of waterworks, railroad contractors, and construction 
engineers, building inspectors, secretaries of military works in the 
war department, and technical secretaries in the navy department. 
The communal administrations also as a rule require for inspectors 
and contractors for their technical building and surface improvement 
an education such as these schools for the building trades furnish. 
These schools are all state schools except the one in Berlin, which 
is chiefly supported by the city government. All are under the 
authority of the ministry of commerce and industry. 
The schools for the building trades are divided into architectural 
schools and schools for surface improvement, and are of five grades. 
In Gérlitz (Silesia) special arrangements have been made for the 
technical preparation of stonecutters. The three lower grades offer 
instruction in both architecture and surface improvement, while in 
the two highest grades the two branches are separated. For students 
whose education is insufficient for admission, preparatory classes may 
be opened. 
The courses of study are arranged for semesters and are carried 
out in winter and summer; hence the course, if taken without inter- 
ruption, may require only 2} years, but few students are able to pass 
through the entire course in that time. The students are advised 
not to interrupt their attendance by more than half a year and to 
attend the two highest grades without any interruption. 
(6) REQUIREMENTS OF ADMISSION. 
The following admission requirements are prescribed: (1) The 
completion of the sixteenth year of life; (2) an education such asa 
people’s elementary school offers. As a rule an examination for ad- 
mission is required. From this examination the candidates excused 
are only the graduates of a fully graded school and of two years’ con- 
tinuation school of six hours per week, or those who have secured in| 
a high school the privilege of one year’s voluntary service in the army, 
The examination for admission includes only two branches, Germa: 
and arithmetic. For these the requirements are the composition o' 
a narrative or a simple business letter and the selection of simpl 
examples from common arithmetic, geometry, and mensuration. 
He who fails in this examination may enter a preparatory class, 
(3) The third requirement is twelve months’ of active work at 
building trade. 
The twelve months of active apprentice work is not required o' 
young people who enter a school for the building trade to lea: 
surface improvement work (Tiefbau) and who have served tw 
years in surveying land, in hydraulic works, in road and railroa    
        
    
   
    
     
  
-P-A-G-E-339

building, in melioration work, as accountants in the royal land office, 
as surveyor’s assistants, or have completed their apprenticeships as 
brick or stone masons, or have served in the engineer or artillery 
corps of the army for four years. Locksmiths and mechanicians 
who wish to go through the course of surface improvement (Tiefbau) 
may be admitted to the lowest grade of a school for builders if they 
have served in their trades as apprentices for four years (or three 
years as apprentices and one year as journeyman). In case they 
are entitled to the privilege of only one year’s voluntary army sery- 
ice they need only two years of practical work as apprentices. 
Should any of the young men indicated in the foregoing paragraph, 
after attending the school for builders for three years, give up the 
idea of preparing for surface improvement (Tiefbau), they are allowed 
to attend the two highest classes in architecture, but only after an 
interruption of their school studies through a full year’s practical 
work in any of the building trades. In exceptional cases young 
men who have a good school education may, with the consent of 
the governor of the province, be admitted after only six months of 
practical labor, provided they agree to go through six additional 
months of trade labor before entering the second grade. In such a 
case the fact is noted in the promotion or term report. 
If a student shows that he is incapable of following the theoretical 
instruction owing to his lack of practical experience, further attend- 
ance may be denied him until he has gained that experience. Students 
wishing to enter a higher grade than the first must prove to the 
satisfaction of the faculty that they possess the required knowledge 
and skill; hence an examination for admission is necessary. 
Scholars of the Royal Prussian Mining School and the School for 
‘Builders in Berlin, as well as all who come from schools of other 
German States,* provided the interval is not longer than a year, 
ay be admitted without examination to a grade to which their 
erm report would entitle them in their former school. Students are 
lso admitted who come from the builders’ department of the indus- 
rial schools of Thorn, Trier (Treves), and Halle.        
                                 
       
       
         
  (c) APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION. 
Accompanying the student’s application for admission the following 
ocuments are required: (1) A curriculum vite composed by the 
pplicant in his own handwriting; (2) a diploma of the elementary, 
iddle, or secondary school where he received his preparation; 
3) reports of any continuation or vocational school he attended; 
4) documentary proof of his having had the practical experience in    
       
             
    
@ Non-Prussian schools for the building trades which have been accepted as equal in scope with the Prus- 
lian schools are those of Munich, Nuremberg, Chemnitz, Dresden, Leipzig, Plauen, Zittau, Stuttgart, 
arlsruhe, Hamburg, Bremen, Lubeck, Darmstadt, Gotha, Zerbst, Holzminden, Strassburg, Chemnitz 
tate Building Academy), Bingen, Coburg. e

actual work which shows the name of the building contractors 
under whom he worked and the nature of the work he has been 
engaged in; (5) a testimonial of the home authorities concerning 
his conduct and nativity. 
If no objections are raised, the applicant receives a card of admis- 
sion which he must show when he claims admission. Those who 
must first pass an examination are notified of the date set for the 
examination. If any applicant is prevented by unforeseen cireum- 
stances from entering the school, he should inform the director at 
once. 
(d) LENGTH OF SCHOOL TERMS. 
The instruction begins on October 18 for the winter semester, and 
on April 2 for the summer semester. If these dates fall on Sunday 
or Monday, the school opens on the following Tuesday. The winter 
semester closes, as a rule, on March 18, and the summer semester 
on August 24. The Christmas vacation extends through 14 days, 
and Whitsuntide vacation through 5 days. If Easter occurs during 
the school term, Good Friday and Easter Monday are holidays. 
(e) TUITION FEES. 
The tuition fee is 80 marks ($20) per semester; in the schools at 
Cologne, Frankfort on the Main, Essen, and Berlin it is 100 marks 
($25). Foreign students must pay 400 marks ($100) and 500 marks 
($125), respectively. In exceptional cases a reduction may be granted 
by the provincial governments. The fees must be paid in advance 
at the beginning of each semester. If a student enters later than on 
the day of opening, or leaves before the semester is closed, no reduc- 
tion or rebate is allowed. Besides the tuition fees, a small contri- 
bution for accident insurance is charged. The required drawing 
boards, utensils, and drawing materials, as well as the text-books, 
blueprints, etc., must be bought by the students themselves. Infor- 
mation as to the things required is given at the beginning of the} 
term.     
   
   
         
      
   
    
   (f) FREE TUITION AND STIPENDS. 
Indigent students may be released from paying the prescribe: 
fees after they have passed through the work of one grade with suc- 
cess, and have conducted themselves faultlessly. Stipends 
granted only to indigent and successful students. 
A petition for free tuition should be handed to the director on o 
before May 15 for the summer semester, and on or before Novembe’ 
15 for the winter semester. Petitions for stipends should be hande 
in, on or before January 15 for the winter semester, and on or befor 
July 15 for the summer semester. Later petitions are not considered 
A petition for free tuition or for a stipend should be accompanied b,

(1) a curriculum vite; (2) the last term or school report; (3) a tes- 
timonial from the police office of the student’s residence, which 
gives evidence of his good deportment, his financial needs, and his 
nativity. In repeating a petition which has been granted for former 
semesters, the last term report is all that need accompany the appli- 
cation. All assistance is granted under the condition that it may be 
evoked in cases of lack of diligence in study or misconduct.

1. Schools for Machine Builders (or of mechanical engineering) 
with a course of four semesters).—These schools are designed to pre- 
are so-called ‘‘middle’’ technical office clerks and foremen in

motive engineers. Those who have been employed in railroad shop 
have the preference in the selection of locomotive firemen and engi 
neers. Those who have no experience in railroad work of any kind 
but who have attended these courses, have the preference for employ- 
ment in railroad shops. 
III. Tecuntca, Scnoots ror THE TEXTILE INDUSTRIES. 
These schools are classed as weavers’ apprentice shops, lowe 
textile schools, and higher technical schools for the textile mdustries 
In the weavers’ apprentice shops young men are trained in servin, 
at mechanical looms, and women and girls from the country ar 
trained in using hand looms’ at their own homes during the winte 
In the lower technical textile schools foremen are trained, and in th 
higher textile schools it is the superintendents, owners, and director} 
of factories who receive a thorough preparation. In this particula| 
each institution pertains to a specific branch of the vast industr, 
represented in the locality. In some institutions separate class 
are opened for merchants and for designers, some have separat 
classes in which young women are taught intricate handiwork, pr 
paring linen for the market, and tailoring.

   The tuition fees for the full higher course are 100 marks ($25) for 
natives, 500 marks ($125) for foreigners, per semester.. Students 
who take part only in the practical exercises pay 50 marks ($12.50) 
if natives, 250 marks ($62.50) if foreigners. For native temporary 
attendants who may choose their own lectures, the fees are 15 marks 
($3.75) for one course (a lecture and attending exercise) a week; for 
foreigners, 50 marks ($12.50). There is also an admission fee for 
foreigners of 60 marks ($15) for the full course. 
The fee for a full course in the lower technical schools amounts to 
30 marks ($7.50) per semester for natives, 250 marks ($62.50) for 
oreigners. Students who take part in the practical exercises only 
ay 30 marks ($7.50) per month if natives, 125 marks ($31.25) if 
oreigners. Temporary attendants choosing special exercises pay 10 
arks ($2.50) if natives, 30 marks ($7.50) if foreigners. The admis- 
ion fee is 30 marks ($7.50) for the full course, but this is charged 
nly to foreigners. 
The fees for the courses for designers and dressmakers, as well as 
or the evening and Sundeyschools, vary a good deal and are adapted 
0 the prevailing local conditions. 
IV. Scnoors ror InpustriaAL Arts AND TRADES. 
The institutions called variously ‘‘ Industrial art schools,’’¢ ‘‘Schools 
or industrial arts and trades,’ ‘‘Trade schools and schools for 
dustry,” or simply ‘‘Trade schools,” serve the purpose of furnishing 
killed labor and intelligent direction for all kinds of industries or 
rades. The industrial art schools are mostly day schools; the indus- 
rial art and trade schools are open during the day, and offer evening 
ssons to laborers who are employed in wage-earning work and can 
ot attend in daytime. The trade schools are almost all evening 
chools, and arrange their lessons so as to serve young laborers and 
pprentices. 
One feature is common to all schools, namely, that each adapts its 
lourse or programme of studies to fit the peculiar industrial conditions 
f the locality; they offer opportunities for instruction in all kinds 
f skilled labor and all branches of art industry (designing). The 
rogramme of studies consists partly of individual courses in ex- 
sive arts, partly of groups of courses all related to a predominant 
cal industry; for such groups a fixed course of study is arranged. 
no school is the course so rigidly enforced, however, as to prevent 
lented students from branching out into individual and original 
ork. In most schools of this kind preparatory classes are opened, 
ther for students insufficiently prepared for admission or for those 
ficient in drawing and sketching. At every school of this kind   
@ Such schools are called “ Schools of design” in this country.

   vocational classes are organized, in which the purely artistic work in 
designing or general technical drawing are taught. Lectures in these 
schools give way to designing and drawing, and in late years the 
workshops assume an ever-increasing importance. 
The evening schools for apprentices provide for both demands, 
designing and technical work. In many schools instruction is given| 
also in mathematics, mechanics, physics, and knowledge of metals. 
The different branches of drawing in the day schools are divided| 
into general and technical branches; the general branches are dif- 
ferentiated again into artistic design and practical working drawing, 
The vocational courses, for which the general drawing courses pre 
pare, are the most important part of the instruction in industrial-a 
schools. Adaptation to local industrial conditions is the reason wh: 
few of these schools have uniform programmes of vocational study 
In all industrial-art schools, however, are found fixed courses fo 
decorative painters, for furniture designers, for sculptors an 
modelers, for locksmiths and jewelers. Most of these schools offer, 
besides those mentioned, courses for engravers, etchers, enamelers 
chasers, flat-design draftsmen, lithographers, and book designers 
in some there are courses of wall decoration, of ceramic arts, and 0: 
bookbinding, and some teach weaving designs for hand looms an 
woman’s artistic handiwork. 
In every one of these specifically vocational courses the studen 
receives, as far as possible, complete preparation for his occupatio 
so that he or she may sketch or design all artistic work or trade plan: 
and be enabled to practically execute in material proposed designs o' 
plans, as well as to invent designs. The programme of each vocation! 
class offers instruction and adequate training, also, in the relate 
artistic and technical arts, as well as careful application of workin, 
drawings and vocational designs. Aside from the various drawin 
classes, there are lectures on technical subjects, such as knowledge 
metals, science of construction, making estimates, and business rule 
relating to trades. 
The duration of these vocational courses varies from two to fo 
years; most of them are arranged for from six to eight semesters. 
All these schools have a number of workshops. The shops mo: 
frequently found are those of the decorators, modelers, chasers, e 
gravers, enamelers, and wood carvers. In classes for decorators t 
actual application of sizewater colors is practiced. Some schoo. 
have workshops for lithographers, jewelers, and printers; a few ha’ 
also shops for artistic bookbinding and gilding, for the ceramic art: 
for hand weaving, stonecutting, woman’s art work, leather workin; 
and photography. The aim is everywhere the same, namely, not 
replace the master courses, but, first of all, to raise the execution 
any task to a higher artistic and technical level.

    Tn the form of class lectures all industrial-art and trade schools treat 
the history of art and principles of style with which knowledge of 
ornamental forms is connected. A further subject of class lectures 
is anatomy. 
Tn all industrial-art and trade schools evening and Sunday classes 
are maintained. Instruction in these classes is confined strictly to 
the limits of the separate trades. very apprentice has the oppor- 
tunity during the evening to participate in lessons of vital interest to 
his trade; and the abundant provision of such lessons, as well as the 
liberty granted him to select from among them, enables him to find 
interesting instruction and work for every evening of the week. The 
lessons in drawing and designing during the day are divided into 
general artistic and vocational drawing lessons. In general lessons, 
instrumental and geometric drawing are preferably taught from the 
first or elementary steps upward. In free-hand drawing the subjects 
are human forms, as well as tools and objects of nature; in many 
schools, copying from plaster casts and flat copies is found. For 
lessons in lettering, especially round-hand lettering, all these schools 
make provision. 
Technical or vocational drawing begins here, as it does in continu- 
ation schools, with the drawing, according to scale, of objects per- 
taining to the particular trade of the student. For trades approach- 
ing art industry, such as those dealing with ornamentation, orna- 
mental drawing and modeling are taught from the beginning. 
The vocational classes in the evenings can not, as a matter of course, 
aim, like the classes in day schools, at making original designs; but 
hey offer to their students of the more technical vocations an amount 
f knowledge and skill in drawing which proves very useful in the 
pursuit of their trades. In more artistic vocations at least a certain 
rtistic taste is developed. 
The industrial-art and trade schools have vacations of twelve weeks 
year, which are divided up in brief vacations at Easter, Whitsuntide, 
ummer, fall, and Christmas. The summer or hot season vacations 
re in some parts of the country connected with the fall or harvest 
acations; in other parts they are separate. 
Admission of new students takes place, as a rule, at the beginning 
f the winter and of the summer semester. 
Attendance at these schools does not result in any kind of privileges, 
xcept that in some schools having classes for the building trades or 
r machine building the privileges held out to students of the build- 
rs’ and machine builders’ schools are granted likewise. The prin- 
ipals of industrial-art schools are often able to secure for their 
dents the privilege of only one year’s army service granted students 
if schools of fine arts. 
Foreigners are uniformly charged five times the amount of tuition 
es paid by natives.

V. Scnoots or Domestic Science, CoMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL 
ScHoots For GIRLs. 
Of the girls’ schools only the three state institutions at Posen, 
Potsdam, and Rheydt have a uniform organization. Each of these 
schools has four departments: Domestic science, industry, business 
practice, and a normal department. In the department of domestic 
science the students take a general survey of everything a thorough 
housewife should know and do. The course extends through one 
year. In the industrial department the students have opportunities 
to prepare themselves well in several occupations (making under- 
clothing, tailoring, millinery, artistic handiwork and drawing, wash- 
ing and ironing, cooking and baking) according to their own choice 
and inclination; the duration of the several courses and the tuition 
fees vary. The business department is organized in two divisions 
corresponding to a secondary commercial school and a lower day 
school for business. For admission to the former, girls must be at 
least 17 years of age and must have graduated from a girls’ high school 
having a nine-year course. In these departments commercial cor- 
respondence and conversation in French and English are taught. 
The course lasts one year. In the lower business schools, girls of ele- 
mentary education are admitted at 15 years of age. This course also 
lasts one year. In the normal department students are prepared to 
become teachers of domestic science and artistic handiwork in| 
elementary, middle, and high schools, as well as for positions in indus- 
trial continuation and vocational schools. The course is fixed accord 
ing to rules and regulations issued jointly by the minister of commerce 
and the minister of education, on June 24, 1907, and the separat 
order of the minister of commerce, on January 23, 1907. 
With these institutions dormitories (Pensionate) are connected. 
The price of board and lodging for native Germans amounts to 860 
1,000, and 1,200 marks ($205, $238, and $285); for foreign student 
the charges are 1,200 or 1,500 marks ($285 or $357). The servic 
includes lodging, board, heat, light, laundry, free treatment b. 
physician in light cases of sickness, and free use of home remedies 
There is also a state school of domestic science, industry, and busines 
at Thorn, but this school has no normal department. 
The private girls’ schools, although subsidized by the State, ar 
organized in various ways. . Certain institutions being well endowe 
gradually adapt themselves partially or entirely to the course an 
organization of the state schools. Since the industrial schools f 
girls are still in the process of development and local conditions ai 
constantly changing more minute information concerning them 
here omitted.

   VI. Courses ror Trape Masters. 
The so-called master courses are institutions intended to raise 
small shop industries to a higher level of efficiency by the instruction 
of shopowners and factory superintendents in practical and theoretical 
branches. The main object is to offer opportunities to the students 
to acquaint themselves with novelties and new technical processes 
and methods within the limits of their own trades, to teach them 
model methods for a business of medium extent and improved tech- 
nical and commercial organization. 
For this purpose the independent master courses are equipped with 
workshops for a number of trades, in which the latest and best tools 
and machines are in working order. The instruction is divided into 
full courses of six to eight weeks, and partial or brief courses of two 
weeks, which may be arranged at intervals several times a year. The 
beginning of the courses is advertised in the press. The number of 
participants in each course is usually limited to ten, so as to afford 
pportunity for individual instruction. 
Conditions of admission.—Admission to the master courses is, as a 
ule, restricted to applicants not under 24 and not over 45 years of 
ge, who have served in the army or were not drafted. In selecting 
he participants, independent masters are preferred; of journeymen 
hose are preferred who intend to open shops of their own. 
Applications—Applications for admission must be made upon 
lank forms furnished by the director of the courses, accompanied by 
curriculum vite, documents proving the applicant’s practical 
mployment, and a testimonial by the local police department con- 
rerning his conduct. 
Costs.—The amount of tuition fees differs in the various institutions 
nd is published by each separately. 
Release from tuition fees and grant of financial aid.—If a participant 
an prove that he is indigent, the minister, upon application, may 
lease him from paying the tuition fees and grant him, besides, 
eans to defray his expenses. These grants differ for masters and 
urneymen, for natives and foreigners. If an indigent person has 
een admitted, he may receive railroad fare (third class), if he lives 
t a considerable distance from the locality where the courses are 
londucted. The petition for release from fees and for a grant of 
oney should accompany the application for admission. 
Other advantages.—All utensils, tools, and raw materials needed are 
rnished to the participants free of cost, except small drawing 
aterials and stationery. A diploma of attendance is given to those 
ho have completed the course; it contains a statement as to the 
sult of attendance. An examination does not take place. 
Courses of study or weekly programmes of some of the vocational 
hools in Prussia are found in Annual Report of the Commissioner 
Education for 1908, Volume I, pages 269 to 274.

MOVEMENTS PERTAINING TO THE UNIVERSITIES OF CANADA. 
Canada is marked at the present time by great activity in respect 
to the extension of the scope of higher education and the concentra- 
ion of its resources. This activity is particularly noticeable in Onta- 
io and Quebec, and may best be illustrated by reference to the 
eading universities of these two provinces. 
In the former the movement for concentration meets with less oppo- 
ition than in the sister provinces, and has already resulted in raising 
he University of Toronto to the plane of a provincial institution, 
earing a relation to the Ontario government somewhat similar to 
hat which the state universities of our own country bear to their 
espective governments. The steps of this gradual transformation 
re of interest not only as part of the recent history of higher educa- 
ion in Ontario, but also for their bearing upon a question of wider 
Importance, namely, that of preserving scholastic standards without 
rejudice to small but time-honored colleges. 
The history of this development has been fully covered by the vol- 
me prepared for the commemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of 
ing’s College, the old nucleus of the university. From this volume® 
derived the following account of the principal events leading up to 
lhe present organization of the University. 
aThe University of Toronto and its Colleges, 1827-1906. ‘The original work was completed by appen- 
es comprising the report of the royal commission of 1905-6, and the university act of May 14, 1906.

        The University of Toronto was created by royal charter, bearing 
date March 15, 1827, “as a university in close connection with the 
Church of England.” The original endowment consisted of one-half 
the land grant of 500,000 acres of land made by the House of Assem- 
bly in 1798 for the promotion of ‘religious and moral learning, and 
the study of the arts and sciences.’ In 1828 the corporation of 
King’s College was created, to which were conveyed by letters patent 
the lands selected for the university endowment. The site for the 
university was chosen the same year. The corner stone of the uni- 
versity building was laid April 23, 1842, and the formal opening 
took place June 8, 1843, when 26 students were enrolled. The 
amended charter of King’s College, obtained in 1837, annulled cer- 
tain provisions of the earlier charter; among them the religious tests 
applied to members of the college council. The charter of 1837 pro- 
vided that it shall not be necessary that “any member of the said col- 
lege council or any professor to be at any time appointed shall be a 
member of the Church of England or subscribe to any articles of 
religion other than a declaration that he believes in the authenticity 
and divine inspiration of the Old and New Testaments, and in the 
doctrine of the Trinity.” A little more than a decade later the uni- 
versity was completely secularized (act of 1849), and its control 
passed to the State. By an act of 1851, amending the charter of the| 
university, it was transformed into an examining body, the work o 
instruction being relegated to separate but affiliated colleges. At th 
same time University College was created as a separate corporation, 
and the faculty of arts, hitherto represented by King’s College, wa: 
transferred to it; the faculties of law and medicine were discontinued 
the work of professional education being left to independent, affilia. 
ated colleges. The three independent colleges—Trinity, Victoria, an 
Queen’s—were at that time in active operation, but as none of thes 
availed themselves of the privilege of affiliation, University Colleg 
became the vital center of the university, sharing in its material 
resources, which included in addition to the endowment of publi 
lands, 61 scholarships, each valued at $120. 
The period 1853 to 1886 was marked by the clash of rival agencies 
in the field of higher education, while at the same time the develop 
ments of science were creating new educational demands and callin; 
for largely increased resources. Under these conditions, the reo 
ganization of the university became a matter of imperative necessit; 
and after prolonged agitation and discussion a bill to this effect w 
introduced into the legislature, the substance of which had alread

   tions under whose fostering care the rival colleges had developed great 
strength and value. Thus supported, the bill was enacted into law 
as “the federation act,” 1857. 
In view of subsequent events, it is enough to note here that this 
act not only provided for the federation of other higher institutions 
with the University of Toronto, but for their representation in the 
senate, the governing body, and in the university council, which had 
advisory and disciplinary functions. The university was once more 
made a teaching body, with power to constitute faculties in arts, law, 
medicine, and engineering. According to Mr. N. Burwash, president 
of Victoria College—* 
University College continued to hold its separate corporate powers; its council con- 
sisted of the president, the professors, and the dean of residence; and these were 
lintrusted with full power for the government of the college. The subjects of instruc- 
tion assigned to the college were Greek, Latin, French, German, English, oriental 
languages, moral philosophy, and ancient history. The transfer of subjects from the 
ollege to the university, or vice versa, required the unanimous consent of the Senate. 
In pursuance of the federation policy, the university senate imme- 
diately entered into an arrangement with the Toronto School of 
fedicine, already in affiliation, by which its professors became the 
edical faculty of the university. After prolonged conflict, the gen- 
ral conference of the Methodist Church agreed to the federation of 
ictoria University, which included faculties of arts and theology, 
nd the relation was consummated November 20, 1890. Immedi- 
tely thereafter representatives of Victoria took their place in the 
enate of Toronto University. The buildings of Victoria in Queen’s 
ark were completed in the autumn of 1892, at an estimated cost of 
230,000, and constituted an important addition to the fine group of 
uildings on the campus. The federated University of Toronto then 
meluded the university faculty of arts, the university faculty of 
edicine, University College, Victoria College with faculties of arts 
nd theology, two theological colleges—Knox and Wycliffe—closely 
ssociated with University College; St. Michael’s College, which 
aught besides theology two university subjects and one college sub- 
lect, belonging to the department of philosophy. There were also in 
ffiliation a number of professional and secondary schools. 
In its practical operation, defects in the féderation scheme were 
aturally disclosed, and, as a result of a movement for the inclusion 
f Trinity University in the federation, important changes looking 
lo the perfecting of the federation system were considered from time 
lo time, and eventually embodied in the university act of 1901, which 
lated chiefly to the governing bodies of the university. 
In accordance with this act and under the supreme authority of the 
rown vested in the lieutenant-governor as visitor, with powers which

might be exercised by commission, the university was to be governed 
by three bodies, as follows: 
(1) The trustees, in charge of the property interests of the university. 
(2) The academic officers, senate, and convocation, in charge of the 
academic work. 
(3) The university council, responsible for the students in regard 
to their scholastic duties, associations, etc. 
FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS. 
The following particulars relative to the financial development of 
the university are derived from an account by the bursar of the 
university: ¢ 
The original endowment of the university was derived from the 
portion of the land grant of 1798, comprising 225,944 acres of land,| 
allotted for that purpose. By the end of 1855 there had been sol 
186,444 acres, or nearly nine-tenths of the whole grant, at an aggregat 
of $1,175,536. The sale of the lands was practically completed b; 
1904, when the total sum realized amounted in round numbers t 
$1,500,000. The fund thus accrued was, in part, invested, and form: 
the nucleus of the present endowment of the university. Thi: 
endowment was augmented by an additional grant of land in 1897, 
by scholarship foundations amounting to $83,000, by donations fro: 
various sources, and an annual grant from the legislature which wi 
fixed, in 1897, at $7,000, and so continued till 1905. 
In 1904-5, the assets of the university were as follows: 
Site lands, academic buildings, equipment, and furniture... 
Lands at present unproductive 
Leased properties...............- 
Investments, cash, and accounts receivable.

With reference to the above presentation, the bursar says: 
Deducting the sum of the various trust funds, scholarships, endowments, etc., f 
which the university is directly liable, amounting to $216,464.76, leaves the figures 
$3,315,924.70 as representing the general endowment, the net assets of the Universit 
of Toronto at the opening of her fourth quarter century of existence. 
THE UNIVERSITY ACT oF 1906. 
The events reviewed will suffice to illustrate the gradual process b 
which the university was changed from a denominational institutio 
with a comparatively narrow field of influence to a state universit 
affecting the intellectual life of the entire population. The chan; 
was coincident with an increase in the public interests and activiti

calling for the services of highly trained men, and it still remained 
to develop to their full efficiency the group of institutions comprised 
in the university confederation. In view of this necessity, a com- 
mission ¢ was appointed in 1905 by the lieutenant-governor of Ontario, 
to inquire into and report upon the system of administering the affairs 
of the University of Toronto and of University College. 
The commission pursued its inquiry for several months, during 
which time the workings of leading universities in the United States 
ere personally investigated by the members of the commission. 
r. Goldwin Smith, one of the members, was familiar with the 
onstitution and administration of the English universities, so that 
very wide range of expert knowledge was brought to bear upon 
he problems to be considered. 
In their report, the commission reviewed the history of the univer- 
ity, rehearsed the conditions that made reorganization necessary, 
nd accompanied their recommendations with a draft bill. This bill, 
ith certain modifications, was accepted as the basis of the university 
ct which was unanimously adopted by the legislature in the session 
f 1906. In the reconstitution of the governing bodies of the uni- 
ersity, the senate and president became the supreme sources of 
uthority; in the formation of the senate, the principle of representa- 
ion of the federated and affiliated institution, and the faculties and 
raduates, was fully recognized. 
A committee styled the caput was created by the act of 1906, 
lonsisting of the president of the university as chairman, the principal 
if University College, the heads of the federated universities, the heads 
f the federated colleges, and the deans of the faculties of the univer- 
ty. The duties of the caput relate to matters affecting more than 
e faculty, or the federated institutions, and, in a broad sense, it acts 
an advisory council to the president and the board of governors of 
e university, the latter being the successor of the former body of 
‘ustees, but invested with larger rights, powers, and privileges. 
In addition to the caput, the following councils are recognized in 
e act: The council of the faculty of arts, the council of University 
lege, and councils of each of the remaining university faculties. 
The act declares that the ‘‘School of Practical Science is hereby 
ited with and shall form a part of the university, and constitute 
e faculty of applied science and engineering thereof.” It is also 
ovided that the name of the university shall be changed to the 
iversity of Ontario, upon the proclamation of the lieutenant- 
vernor to that effect.     
    
   
    
     
   
    
    
              
    
   
    
      
    
   
     
The commission was constituted as follows: J. W. Flavelle (chairman), Goldwin Smith, W. R. Mere- 
, B. E. Walker, H. J. Cody, D. Bruce Macdonald, A. H. U. Colquhoun (secretary). 
The universities of the United States visited were Wisconsin, Illinois, Chicago, Michigan, Cornell, 
Hopkins, Princeton, Columbia, Yale, and Harvard.
-P-A-G-E-358
  350 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
For the purpose of making provision for the maintenance and 
support of the university and of University College it is provided 
that ‘there shall be paid to the board out of the consolidated revenue 
of the province, yearly and every year, a sum equal to 50 per centum 
of the average yearly gross receipts of the province from successive 
duties.” : 
The institutions named in the act of 1906, as federated with the 
University of Toronto, are Victoria University (founded by the 
Methodists as a college, 1836; federated, 1892), Trinity College 
(founded by the Church of England, 1852; federated, 1906), andj 
three theological colleges—Knox, Wycliffe, and St. Michaels. 
Victoria and Trinity were universities with degree-conferring pow 
ers, which were surrendered at the time of the federation, exceptin; 
only the power to confer degrees in theology. 
The act provides that— 
the graduates and undergraduates in arts, science, and law of a federated universit; 
and such graduates and undergraduates thereof in medicine as have passed thei 
examinations in Ontario from and after the date whensuch university became federate 
with the university, and so long as such federation shall continue, shall have and enjo; 
the same degrees, honors, and status in the university as they held and enjoyed in th 
federated university.     
       
      
     
         
      
   
    
    
   
    
   
         
   Of special significance is the provision that— 
instruction in arts in the university (except postgraduate instruction) shall be free 
all regular matriculated students thereof who are enrolled in University College or i 
a federated university and who enter their names with the registrar of the universit; 
but this provision shall not include exemption from laboratory fees, gymnasium fee: 
or fees for physical examination or instruction;” and, further, that ‘‘all student 
proceeding to a degree in arts in the university, unless in cases for which special pr 
vision shall be made to the contrary by statute of the senate, shall be enrolled jj 
University College or in a federated university. 
The affiliated colleges, which at present number eleven directly affil 
ated and three by reason of previous affiliation with Victoria an} 
Trinity, prepare students for matriculation in the university and f 
“any university examination subsequent to that for matriculati 
leading to a degree in that branch of learning in which instruction 
given in such college.” It is, however, specially provided ‘th 
such student shall not be entitled, unless by special permission of t 
senate, to present himself for any examination leading to a degree 
arts or in any other faculty of the university.” 
The distinctive character of the institution resulting from the lo: 
process of consolidation is set forth by the commission of 1905-6 
follows: 
The organization of the university is not exactly parallel to that of either an Ameri 
ora British university. Through federation we have developed a form of organizatij 
that is unique. The state provides a complete system of education in arts in 
University of Toronto and the University College. The subjects taught in Univers 
College are taught also in the denominational colleges of Victoria and Trinity. All 
students who take lectures in the university subjects must be enrolled in one of thy

ee colleges. We belive that the university has thus by apparent chance hit upon 
system which, if properly and loyally worked, provides a combination of strong 
ersonal influence on students with the broad outlook and widened sympathies that 
ome from membership in a great university. The colleges will maintain the impor- 
nce of liberal culture in the face of commercial and industrial development and the 
owth of scientific activity. The colleges will be able to bring the strongest influ- 
neces to bear upon their own comparatively limited number of students and to foster 
common life among them free at once from the narrowness of the small university 
md the lack of social union of a huge undivided university. In the colleges of the 
nited States efforts are being made to break up the great aggregation of undergrad- 
tes in arts into smaller groups, which may be more easily handled for disciplinary 
urposes and for more efficient direction of the work. The divisions proposed seem 
ore or less artificial; at best they are lateral, such as class organizations. In our 
proximation to a college system we have at hand a more excellent method of sub- 
ivision by which men of all years and all courses are bound together by a tie of mem- 
ership in a common college, and the teachers of the various colleges are enabled to 
me into closer personal touch with the men under their charge. The combination 
a state college and denominational colleges provides variety of ideal and spirit and 
oids the dead level of uniformity that might ensue in one large undivided body, 
d furnishes to each member the needful stimulus of healthy rivalry. 
PRESENT STATUS. 
The university occupies a fine site, which, originally remote from 
e city, is now in the midst of one of the choice residential districts. 
Ihe main university building, the library building, laboratories, and 
ildings for special departments are all situated on the campus. 
e Victoria College buildings were erected on the campus after the — 
deration was accomplished. 
The beautiful buildings of Trinity College are in the midst of a 
rk, 35 miles in extent, somewhat remote from the university site. 
In the federated’ university liberal education in the fullest sense 
the expression is represented by the faculty of arts, University 
lege, and Victoria and Trinity colleges. The requirements per- 
ining to these constituent divisions determine the purely scholastic 
ndard of the university, which is guarded both by the entrance 
d graduation requirements. 
According to announcements in the latest calendar of the univer- 
y, candidates for the degree of bachelor of arts must pass the 
ior matriculation examination or offer specified equivalents. 
e examination comprises, as obligatory subjects, Latin, English, 
tory, and mathematics, and as optional the choice of any two of 
following: Greek, German, French, experimental science. 
ndergraduates proceeding to the degree of bachelor of arts must be enrolled in 
iversity College, Victoria College, or Trinity College, and must attend lectures 
loughout the session in all the subjects of their academic year, unless the council 
the faculty, on the recommendation of the college in which they are enrolled, grant 
m. dispensation from attendance for the whole or part of the session.

Dispensation f:om attendance at lectures will not be granted to students in thi

concerned. 
* * * * * * * 
Term work.—In the general course reports on the term work of every student enrolle 
as proceeding to a degree will be made in all the subjects of each year. 
In an honor course reports in term work will be made whenever such work is specifie 
as an essential part of the course.

       No candidate will be granted pass standing in a subject of the general course unle: 
he obtain at least 33 per cent of the examination marks, as well as 33 per cent of tl 
aggregate of the term work and examination marks in that subject. 
No candidate will be granted honors in a subject where term work is taken in 
account unless he obtain at least 50 per cent of the marks at the May examination, 
well as 50 per cent of the aggregate of the term work and examination marks in th: 
subject. 
The general arts course comprises Latin, English, history, a: 
religious knowledge continued throughout the four years; scien 
studies distributed as follows: First year, mechanics, physics, a: 
biology; second year, chemistry and geology; third year, physic} 
In the second year the history of philosophy, psychology, and log 
are taken up; in the third year, ethics and English constitution 
history; in the fourth year, economics, constitutional law, a: 
. ethics. In addition to the foregoing, choice must be made ea 
year of any two of the following branches: Greek, Hebrew, Germa 
French, Spanish, religious knowledge (the last named more extend 
than in the pass course). 
Honor courses are offered in the classical languages, mode 
languages, the sciences, the historical and ethical branches, and 
philosophy. Students who complete the prescribed course, eit. 
general or honor, and pass the required examinations receive t 
degree of bachelor of arts. 
This scheme of general education, it will be seen, provides 
modern branches without the sacrifice of the older studies—t| 
classics and ethical and religious subjects. 
The bachelor’s degree, which crowns the arts course, is a p' 
requisite to the degrees of M. A. and Ph. D. and to matriculatij 
as a regular student in the faculty of education. This degree a 
admits a student to the third year of the law course and to the medi 
course without examination. 
While the idea of liberal education as a discipline alike of 
intellectual and moral nature, and in all forms of knowledge, 
thus been maintained in the university, the importance of m 
specialized courses of instruction is fully recognized. In mak 
provision for such courses care has been taken to preserve reg: 
for culture values in education, so far as this is compatible with

special end in view. Thus, the same examination is required for 
admission to the faculty of household science and to the faculty of 
forestry as for admission to the arts course, but the curricula of the 
two faculties are specialized. Candidates for admission to the 
faculty of applied science and engineering must also pass the same 
entrance examination, excepting that equivalents are allowed for 
Latin and Greek. 
A suggestive example of the combination of general and pro- 
fessional courses of instruction, with a view to shortening the period 
of preparation for the active duties of professional life, is afforded 
by the institution in the arts curriculum of a a entitled ‘The 
honor department of biological and physical sciences.” This course, 
ithe calendar states— 
is specially adapted for students who intend entering eventually upon medicine, and 
mbraces the purely science subjects which are demanded of students in the primary 
ears of medicine. It is therefore possible for a candidate who has obtained his arts 
egree in this course to enter immediately the third year of medicine, and he will be 
ualified to present himself for the degree of bachelor of medicine two years after 
raduating in arts. In other words, it is possible for one to obtain the degrees of 
achelor of arts and bachelor of medicine after six years’ study at the university. 
The very great advantages of this course to a student entering medicine are obvious. 
he preliminary science subjects of the course in medicine are taught in much greater 
etail in the arts course, as in the latter is included advanced laboratory and experi- 
ental work, such as is not required in the purely medical course of studies. Further, 
e student is required to become proficient in modern languages, an acquirement 
hich is of great value to the student of modern scientific medicine.

Upon prescribed conditions the university confers the diploma of 
public health, the degree of doctor of dental surgery, the degree of 
doctor of veterinary surgery, a diploma in commerce, a diploma in 
gymnastics and physical drill, and a diploma in music. 
Students who complete the four-year course in the Ontario Agri- 
cultural College, which was affiliated with the university in 1888, 
receive the degree of bachelor of the science of agriculture. 
While in its enlarged scope the University of Toronto is the directive 
force in higher education in the Province of Ontario, it has also been 
brought into vital relation with the system of public instruction 
through the recognition accorded to the faculty of education. This 
faculty was created by a resolution of the governors of the university 
in 1906; its curriculum was adopted in June, 1907, and in October o 
the latter year its first session was opened. The courses of instruc 
tion are intended to prepare candidates for diplomas as special o 
regular teachers and, in particular, for provincial certificates as firs 
class public-school teachers and as high-school assistants and special 
ists. The full courses in this faculty lead to postgraduate degrees i 
arts and philosophy and to degrees in pedagogy. With regard to provi 
sion for the practical application of the theoretic instruction in thi 
actual work of teaching, the announcement is made that, ‘pendin 
the erection of its own model schools, the faculty will use the publi 
and high schools of Toronto for purposes of observation and practic 
teaching. It will conduct its other exercises in the rooms of the uni 
versity and its colleges, and amid university influences.” 
The education department, on its side, accepts the courses o 
instruction in the faculty of education in lieu of examination for thi 
certificates issued by the department according to a prescribe 
scheme of correlatives. 
The registration of students in the constituent colleges and th

   In the foregoing account of the University of Toronto incidental 
ference is made to Dr. Goldwin Smith, who was a member of the 
ommission under whose advice the plan of federation and expansion, 
s explained in this chapter, was developed. The death of this dis- 
inguished man, which occurred June 6 of the present year, has 
eprived Canada of a citizen whose remarkable powers were always 
t the service of the public welfare. Although Canada had been for 
any years his chosen country, Dr. Goldwin Smith belonged almost 
qually to the United States, while at the same time he formed, as it 
ere, a bond of union with the mother country. He was born at 
eading, England, August 23, 1823. His preparatory education 
as acquired at Eton. “He was graduated from Magdalen College, 
xford, in 1845, and later took the degree of M. A. He gained various 
rizes and two scholarships, and in 1847 became a fellow of University 
ollege, Oxford. The same year he was called to the bar at Lincoln’s 
nn, but he never practiced law. In 1882 Oxford gave him the 
egree D.C. L., and in 1896 Princeton made him an LL. D. He was 
legius professor of modern history at Oxford from 1858 to 1866. In 
868 -Goldwin Smith removed to this country, and from that year 
mtil 1871 was a lecturer at Cornell University on English and con- 
itutional history; in the latter year he removed to Canada, but 
ill continued to hold an honorary or nonresident professorship at 
ornell. Hence the universities of all three countries may fairly 
aim a share in his distinction. He illustrated, in fact, in his own 
erson that union of English commonwealths which was one of his 
ndly cherished ideals. 
MoGity Unriversiry. 
McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, owes its origin to a private 
dowment bequeathed by the Hon. James McGill, a native of Scot- 
nd, who emigrated to Canada and accumulated a fortune in the fur 
ade. His will, dated January 8, 1811, left an estate and a sum of 
10,000 in money “‘to found a college in a provincial university, the 
ection of which had already been provided for by the generosity of 
e British Government. Three leading citizens of Montreal were 
ong the trustees appointed under his will, who were directed to 
nvey the subject property of the bequest to the Royal Institution 
r the Advancement of Learning, a body which, in 1802, had been 
corporated by the legislature for the establishment of free schools 
d the advancement of learning in the Province of Quebec.”” The 
ll provided also that the college or one of the colleges in the uni- 
rsity, if established, should be ‘‘named and perpetually be known 
d distinguished by the appellation of McGill College.’ 
The project of a provincial university failed, but the Royal Institu- 
m took measures to secure a charter for McGill College, which was

granted in 1821. On account, however, of difficulties in the settlement 
of the estate, the scholastic work did not begin until 1829, when 
students were received in the faculties of arts and medicine. After 
prolonged struggle the citizens of Montreal awoke to the value of th 
institution; an amended charter was secured in 1852; and in 1855. 
with the advent of a new principal, an era of prosperity began. 
The governors (members of the Royal Institution for the Advance 
ment of Learning) and the principals and fellows (representing thi 
faculties and departments of the university, the graduates, an 
affiliated colleges) together constitute the corporation, which i 
empowered to make all regulations for courses of study, matricula 
tion, graduation, discipline, and the granting of degrees. 
A special feature of the constitution is the clause by which th 
supreme authority over the institution is vested in the Crown, bu 
to be exercised ‘‘by His Excellency the Governor-General of Canad 
for the time being as visitor.” This relation raised the university t 
the national plane. 
Through the affiliation of high schools the university has become 
directive force in the work of the Protestant public schools, while b 
the expansion of the faculty of applied science and the recent inco 
poration of Macdonald College its scope has been extended to includ 
the modern sciences and technical professions.

The postgraduate and second professional degrees conferred by t 
university and the principal conditions pertaining to them are 
follows: M. A. and M. Sc. on graduates after at least one year 
graduate study; D. Ph., after at least three years’ graduate stud, 
D. Lit. (doctor of literature) upon graduates of at least five yea: 
standing, having the M. A. degree, distinguished by special resear 
and learning as indicated by an original thesis on some subject in t 
domain of literature or philosophy; D. Sc. upon candidates havi

the degree of M. A., M. Sc., or M. D. and at least five years’ profes- 
sional experience and special distinction; D.C. L. upon bachelors of 
law of at least twelve years’ standing who pass a required examination. 
In addition to the degrees named above, the university confers the 
diploma of commerce, for which a two years’ course is arranged in 
the faculty of arts; a diploma in household science, for which a two 
years’ course is maintained in Macdonald College; and the degree of 
bachelor of music upon candidates fulfilling the specified conditions. 
Apart from Macdonald College, the growth of the university has 
been by a process of inward expansion; hence, as compared with the 
University of Toronto, there is a noticeable tendency to concentra- 
tion, rather than to the multiplication of faculties; for example, the 
faculty of arts includes a year’s course in education for students who 
wish to obtain an academy diploma for the Province of Quebec; the 
faculty of applied science comprises ten specialized technical courses, 
including chemistry, the different orders of engineering, metallurgy, 
railways (theory and practice), all leading to the degree of B. Sc., 
with mention on diploma of the particular course of study pursued. 
Macdonald College, which occupies a beautiful site overlooking the 
Ottawa River at Ste. Anne de Bellevue, 20 miles west of Montreal, 
comprises three departments, all of which have been organized to 
meet educational demands arising from modern conditions. 
These departments are as follows: 
The school for teachers, which offers a comprehensive and thoroughly practical 
training in the art and science of teaching. 
The school of agriculture, which aims to provide a thoroughly theoretical and 
practical training in the several branches of agriculture. 
The school of household science, in which young women receive training which 
will make for the improvement and greater enjoyment of home life. 
By an agreement with the government of the province, confirmed 
iby legislative act, it is provided that the teaching and training in the 
chool for teachers— 
hall, subject to the regulations at all times of the Protestant committee, be under 
e direction of a committee, to be called the teachers’ training committee. 
According to an agreement sanctioned by the legislature, the 
bove-named committee consists— 
f the principal of McGill University for the time being, who shall be ex officio chair- 
an; of two persons appointed by the Protestant committee; of the English secre- 
ry of the council of public instruction; of the professor of education in McGill 
niversity for the time being; of the principal, for the time being, of Macdonald 
‘ollege; of the head, for the time being, of the teachers’ training department of 
acdonald College; and of one person appointed by the corporation of McGill 
niversity; the persons appointed, respectively, by the corporation of McGill Uni- 
ersity and by the Protestant committee to hold office for a term of three years and 
be eligible for reelection.

     Through the authority conferred on this representative commit- 
tee, the ‘‘school for teachers” in Macdonald College becomes prac- 
tically a provincial normal school of university rank. 
The graduate instruction offered in McGill University was formally 
organized in 1906 by the establishment of a graduate school in which 
are registered all students ‘‘following advanced courses of study in 
subjects which, in the undergraduate work, fall within the scope of 
the faculties of arts and applied science. 
“The faculty of the graduate school consists of the professors of the 
faculties of arts and applied science, but the initiative and adminis- 
tration of the school is placed in the hands of a committee selected 
from these faculties and known as the ‘committee on graduate 
studies.’” 
The university has met the demand for an abridgment of the 
period of preparation for professional life by combinations of under- 
graduate and professional courses of instruction. Medical students 
may thus secure the bachelor’s degree and the doctor’s degree in eight 
years, and law students the B. A. and B. C. L. in six years. 
Affiliation of Vancouver College, British Columbia, with McGill 
University was effected in 1896, when an act was passed by the 
legislature of British Columbia authorizing McGill University to 
exercise the same rights in that province as in the Province of 
Quebec. The act provided for— 
the incorporation of a body politic under the name of ‘‘The Royal Institution for the 
Advancement of Learning in British Columbia,’’ with power to establish, at such 
place in British Columbia as McGill University may designate, a college for the 
higher education of men and women, such college, in respect of courses of study 
and examinations, to be deemed a college of McGill University, and the instruction) 
given to its students to be of the same standard as that given in like subjects at 
McGill University at Montreal. In pursuance of the objects of its foundation, there- 
fore, the Royal Institution in 1906 established at Vancouver the McGill University 
College of British Columbia, by agreement with the board of school trustees takin; 
over the arts work previously done by Vancouver College, with extension of the scop 
and options allowed, and adding the first two years of the course in the faculty ot 
applied science. 
In 1908 Victoria College, British Columbia, which had been 
affiliation with McGill University, was merged into the universit 
college. Alberta College, in the province of the same name, whic! 
was affiliated with McGill University soon after its organization, h 
become the constituent college of Alberta University, created in 1907 
The number of students registered in McGill University in th 
session of 1909-10 was 1,912, of which total 31 were duplicat 
registrations. 
The distribution of students was as follows: In arts, McGi

   Lavat UNIVERSITY. 
Laval University, the center of higher education for the Catholic 
population of the Province of Quebec, is extremely conservative, 
but at the same time it has taken measures to meet the new demands 
of modern life. The university was founded by the Seminary of 
Quebec (ecclesiastical body) in 1852, in which year a royal charter 
was granted by Queen Victoria. By a papal bull of April 15, 1876, 
the university was accorded full canonical recognition, and the 
bishops of Quebec were exhorted to use every effort to bring the 
Roman Catholic colleges and seminaries throughout the province 
into affiliation with this central institution. 
In respect to matters of doctrine and discipline the university is 
under the supervision of a superior council consisting of the arch- 
bishops and bishops of the Province of Quebec, under the presidency 
of the archbishop of the city of Quebec, who is the apostolic chan- 
cellor of the university. The four faculties—theology, law, medi- 
cine, and arts—were organized from the first. The affiliated colleges 
must, at least, prepare students for the examination for inscription 
in the faculty of arts and for the baccalaureate examination. The 
higher seminaries or theological schools of the province, in order to 
be affiliated, must meet the required conditions as regards doctrinal 
beliefs and must prepare students for the degree of bachelor of 
theology. The higher degrees conferred by the university are the 
licencié and doctor, corresponding to the similar degrees conferred 
by the universities of France. 
The most significant event in the more recent history of Catholic 
igher education in Quebec was the creation of Laval University at 
ontreal (1876) as a branch (succursale) of the parent institution, 
ut having independent administration and equality of privileges. 
Like the older university, the Montreal branch is organized in 
our faculties. Apart from the fact that it brings provision for 
igher education within easy access of the youth of Montreal, its 
mportance lies in the affiliation of several schools of modern type, 
amely, the Polytechnic of Montreal; the Agricultural Institute at 
ka, founded in 1893 by the Trappist Fathers of Notre-Dame-du-Lac; 
nd a school for the higher education of girls, founded by the Sisters 
f La Congrégation de Notre Dame. 
The Agricultural Institute was founded in 1893, and has already 
xercised a marked influence by exciting an intelligent interest in  
-P-A-G-E-368

rural industries and in preparing young people for them. As a 
result of affiliation with the university an advanced course of instruc- 
tion in agricultural subjects has been organized in the institute.

MovEMENTS IN OTHER CANADIAN UNIVERSITIES. 
The solicitude for established standards manifested through all 
changes by the three universities above considered is equally notice- 
able in the remaining universities of Canada, whether in the older 
provinces or in those recently organized, and is undoubtedly due, in 
great measure, to the unbroken relation with England and the 
privilege of affiliation with the universities of the mother country 
if the standards meet the requirements. This privilege carries for 
students who may seek admission to English universities recogni- 
tion of the work previously accomplished in the Canadian univer. 
sities. At the same time there are signs that the modern spirit i 
affecting the higher institutions throughout the Dominion. 
The need of consolidation has been recognized in Nova Scotia. 
which, for a population of about 460,000, has no less than eigh 
universities or degree-conferring colleges. With a single exceptio 
these are denominational institutions—three Roman Catholic an 
one for each of the following denominations: Church of England 
Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian. Dalhousie College and Uni 
versity, Halifax, which started under Presbyterian auspices, wa: 
reorganized by the legislature in 1863 as an undenominational an 
provincial university, in which character it has attracted a large: 
number of students than all the other universities combined. Thes 
institutions formerly received government grants, which were wit 
drawn in 1881 on account of the opposition to a proposed plan 
consolidation.

   The recent development of technical professions has given new 
motives for consolidation and an agreement has recently been reached 
by which four of the universities of Nova Scotia—namely, Acadia, 
Dalhousie, King’s, and St. Francis Xavier, together with Mount 
Allison University in New Brunswick—have come into affiliation with 
the Nova Scotia Technical College. 
Under the terms of this affiliation the separate universities offer 
la uniform course in engineering covering the first two years of a four- 
ears’ course, and the Technical College offers the last two years in 
our branches of engineering, viz, civil, electrical, mechanical, and 
ining. It is announced that— 
similar arrangement is also being tried in coordinating the general courses in each 
miversity to lead to a university post-graduate examination as the scholarship basis 
f the new academic class of teachers. Some subjects are accepted as passed in each 
miversity, such as history, philosophy, and psychology, while others are tested by 
he new examination syllabus in such subjects as English, foreign languages, mathe- 
atics, and the sciences. 
The Technical College, which is situated in Halifax, has recently 
aken possession of a new building equipped for instruction in all 
rders of engineering and also for meeting the needs of students in 
chnical branches who are not aspirants for a professional degree. 
Provision for technical education in Nova Scotia is completed by 
he agricultural college at Truro. This institution has entered into 
ffiliation with the Provincial Normal College in carrying on the 
ural Science School maintained during the months of July and 
ugust of each year; the purpose of this school is to bring the pupil 
achers directly in contact with the various phases of nature, encour- 
ging them to study at first hand soils and plants, insects and birds, 
nd weather phenomena, everything, in fact, which constitutes the 
nvironment especially of their rural school scholars. A regular 
urriculum is followed, which, when completed to the satisfaction of 
lhe instructors, entitles the teacher to receive the Rural Science 
iploma. 
The chancellor of the University of New Brunswick in his report for 
909 urges the need of increased resources for the department of 
athematics and the department of physics and electrical engineering, 
nd for the provision of advanced courses in education. In view 
Iso of current interest in agricultural education he expresses the 
ope ‘‘that any scheme relating to this matter may be worked out in 
mnection with the university and in close affiliation with the tech- 
ical work now carried on there.” 
The University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, is the only degree-conferring 
stitution in the province, and the colleges of the province are 
liated with it.

    The University of Alberta was created by an act of 1906, the year 
following the admission of the province to the Canadian union, and 
was organized in 1907 with faculties of arts and science. Women are 
admitted on the same conditions as men to the degree courses of the 
arts faculty. 
The University of Saskatchewan, which province was also admitted 
to the union in 1905, was established by legislative act of April 3, 
1907. The act provides for the maintenance and support of the 
university by provincial appropriations and for the affiliation of 
collegiate institutes. The university senate is authorized to “make 
full provision for the education of women in the university in such 
manner as it shall deem most fitting; provided, however, that no 
woman shall by reason of her sex be deprived of any advantage or 
privilege accorded to male students of the university.” 
There are at present about 18 degree-conferring institutions and| 
30 colleges in the Dominion, with a registration of nearly 20,000} 
students.

THE PROVINCIAL SYSTEMS OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
PrrvcrpaL Features. 
By the British North American act of 1867 the right to legislat 
on matters respecting education was left to the governments of t 
four provinces (Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick 
which were then united under the general name of Dominion 
Canada. The same right has been assured also to the provine 
that have since entered the confederation—Prince Edward Islan 
Manitoba, British Columbia, Northwest Territories, Alberta, a 
Saskatchewan. (Until 1905 the two last-named provinces formed 
part of the Northwest Territories.)

   Prior to the federation, education had become a matter of interest 
in all the provinces. Ontario had a well-organized system of public 
schools, Quebec had brought its parochial schools under public 
supervision, and the smaller maritime provinces had proved their 
interest in the cause both by legislation and by grants for schools 
from public funds. The Ontario system has been adopted as a 
odel, to some degree, in the remaining provinces, Quebec alone 
xcepted. 
The control of the system of Ontario is vested in the minister of 
ducation, who is more than an executive officer. As a member of 
he legislature he initiates and largely directs school legislation, 
nd his judicial functions and powers of appointment add weight to 
the policies he advocates. No other province has reposed equal 
uthority in the chief officer of education, but all have sought to 
ecure uniformity of school provision and educational standards by 
eans of government control. 
In Quebec the schools are sectarian; that is, they are distinctively 
ither Roman Catholic or Protestant schools. The former are under 
cclesiastical control, which for this purpose is organized in accord- 
nce with the provisions of the school laws; the Protestant schools 
re in like manner under Protestant control. In Ontario, Alberta, 
nd Saskatchewan provision is made for separate schools for Protes- 
ants and for Catholics where desired, and the supporters of these 
leparate schools are exempt from the payment of local taxes for the 
pport of the public schools. The separate schools are subject to 
jovernment inspection and, in general, are under the same regula- 
ons as the public schools. 
The public elementary schools are free schools, excepting in Que- 
ec, where fees are charged which may not exceed 50 cents a month 
or be less than 5 cents a month. In the model schools and acad- 
ies of this province, which correspond to the grammar and high 
hools of our own States, the fees may be higher.¢ In the high 
hools of Ontario fees are charged, but may be, and often are, 
mitted at. the discretion of the school authorities. With these 
ceptions the public schools of the several provinces are free and 
The following extract from a letter from the department of public instruction, Quebec (dated June 30, 
.), throws light upon certain peculiarities of school classification and administration in that province: 
‘The terms “model school” and “academy ”’ as used in this province are likely to be misleading to stran- 
, and there is now a proposal to change our nomenclature so as to remove the difficulties which now 
ist in this direction. 
ur public schools are “elementary” covering the first four years’ work; “model,” covering the fifth, 
th, and seventh years; and “academy,” covering the eighth, ninth, and tenth years. The work is con- 
uous, so that the last year of one grade qualifies for the first year of the next. 
asmuch as many school municipalities defray the expenses of schools of all grades from a general fund, 
Is impossible to know exactly the total cost of elementary education as distinguished from secondary 
ication. 
ur clerk of statistics reports that the elementary schools receive approximately 90 per cent of the total 
‘tributions for school purposes (in 1903 reported to be $3,471,989), and that the secondary schools receive 
remaining 10 per cent. EDUCATION IN CANADA. 363

   nonsectarian, their support being derived from provincial grants 
and local (municipal) appropriations and school taxes. 
The mode of apportioning the legislative grant among the school 
districts differs in the different provinces, but in all there is apparent 
the purpose to make the provincial appropriation a means of stim- 
ulating rather than of lessening local effort in behalf of the schools. 
The increased public provision for education to meet new indus- 
trial demands has naturally caused some increase in administrativ 
agencies. This is particularly noticeable in Ontario, where the cen. 
tral department has been strengthened by the addition of an adviso: 
council and a superintendent of education. The latter is expecte 
to aid the department by virtue of his professional experience an 
knowledge dissociated from the full administrative control whic! 
remains in the hands of the responsible minister. 
The advantages of this addition to the professional strength of th 
department are shown by the consolidation of the laws pertainin; 
to the department, the revision and consolidation of school law: 
and programmes, and the compilation of a draft syllabus of studies fo: 
the guidance of teachers. In this last work the department sough 
assistance from the Ontario Educational Association in order tha‘ 
the revision might represent the results of the largest practic: 
experience. 
SratisticaL Summary. 
In view of new departures in popular education the following st 
tistics pertaining to the public schools may be regarded not alon| 
as indicating their present status, but as a standard by which thejj 
progress in the era of expansion upon which the Dominion is ente: 
ing may be estimated:

ALIENT PARTICULARS IN THE CURRENT REcoRD oF PuBLIC SCHOOLS. 
The movement for the promotion of manual training in the public 
chools of Canada, and the allied movement for the improvement of 
ral education by the establishment of school gardens, and the con- 
olidation of rural schools,“ have passed the experimental stages and 
ave either become permanent features of the systems of public 
struction or have effected marked modifications in the spirit and 
ethods of the schools. 
These two movements, it will be recalled, were fostered, in the 
itiatory stages, by the liberal donations of Sir William C. Macdonald, 
dministered by Dr. James W. Robertson, who became, subsequently, 
e principal of Macdonald College. 
With regard to manual training in urban schools, it should be stated 
at the education authorities themselves had in many instances 
arted the work before the Macdonald fund was donated. The pres- 
t status of the forms of practical training started by this fund, or 
iccelerated by its administration, is shown by the following particulars 
rawn from recent reports: 
Ontario.—In Ontario, 49 manual training centers were reported for 
07, of which 13 were in public schools of Ottawa, 7 in Toronto, 4 in 
amilton, and 6in normal schools. In 1908 the number was increased 
3 centers, and in 1909 by 5 centers. 
Household science centers have been established in 9 schools of 
ronto, in 4 schools of Hamilton, and in 18 additional schools in dif- 
rent localities.   
For a detailed account of these movements supported by the Macdonald fund, see Report of the Com- 
sioner of Education for 1907, Vol. I, chapter 7, pp. 225-237.

       Commenting on these particulars, Mr. Leake, the inspector of 
technical education, says: 
The magnificent gift of Mrs. Massey Treble to the university of an ideal building for 
carryipg on household science work marks an era in its development and offers an 
example worthy of the consideration of our wealthy men. 
There is not the same difficulty in securing properly qualified teachers in this subject 
as exists in the case of manual training, largely owing to the fact that before an indi- 
vidual can take the necessary course in order to qualify as a manual training teacher he 
must have at least a second class normal certificate, while the corresponding qualifica- 
tion for household science is junior leaving or junior matriculation. 
The outlook for both these subjects is extremely bright. As pointed out in the 
report for last year there were 13 towns of a population of 5,000 or over without manual 
training or household science. That number has now been reduced to ten and sey- 
eral of the ten will probably undertake the subjects in the near future, while several 
towns of less than that population are seriously considering the desirability and advis- 
ability of doing so. 
The further developments needed in the province as stated by Mr. 
Leake are as follows: 
1. Modification of the course in the last two years of the public school in which boys 
and girls might have the option of taking a two years’ course in vocational training} 
suited especially to the particular locality. 
2. The establishment of vocational schools that would take the boy, industriall: 
inclined, at 14 years of age and give him a two or three years’ trade course. For admis 
sion to these schools the entrance examination should not be required. 
3. Manual training in wood and metal and household science, including needlework, 
laundry, and general house management, in every high school. Without losing any of 
their cultural value these subjects could and should have a decidedly more industria! 
trend than they have at present. The equipments should be used for both day an 
evening classes. 
4. A development of the courses in mechanical, machine, and architectural drawin; 
and industrial design in every high school and the inclusion of more elementary indus 
trial drawing in the public schools. This is the basis of any technical or industrial 
training. 
Interest in school gardens and consolidated rural schools in Ontari 
has developed into a broader scheme of public instruction for rur: 
communities. This is indicated by several measures of which th 
most important is the continuation schools act bearing date April 1 
1909. This act provides for the better organization of the co 
tinuation schools already existing and offers new inducements f 
the establishment of additional schools of this class. The continu 
tion schools are virtually high schools closely coordinated with t 
public schools, and carefully adjusted as regards curriculum, lengt 
of course, etc., to local demands. A continuation school may 
organized as an upper department of a public school under a speci: 
teacher or as an independent school, and may serve two or mo 
school districts by an agreement on the part of their respecti 
school boards. County councils are also empowered by the act “‘ 
create and constitute continuation school districts.” These elasti
-P-A-G-E-375

conditions indicate the purpose to open the door of opportunity to 
every child in the province, without, however, interfering at all with 
the prior rights of established high schools, the law expressly pro- 
viding that a continuation school shall not be established or main- 
tained in a high school district. 
In his report for 1909, the inspector of continuation schools says: 
              
        
   
    
    
    
      
       
    
    
          
        
      
   The opportunity to start a continuation school is no less favorable to a rural board 
f trustees than to the board of a village or a town. 
In the case of a rural school section the grants from all sources may be regarded as 
t least the equivalent of the salary of the continuation school teacher. In the first 
lace the township must pay annually the same grant toward the salary of the con- 
inuation school teacher as it is required to pay in the case of the principal of the 
ublic school. Except in the case of the small number of weak townships this grant 
ounts to $300. Then there is the fixed annual grant of $200 paid equally by legis- 
lature and county council, the annual grant on minimum equipment amounting to 
70, similarly paid, the annual grant on accommodations averaging about $30, simi- 
larly paid, the annual grant on salary of teacher, amounting to 50 per cent of all sal- 
ry in excess of $400 up toa limit of $1,000, also similarly paid. * * * Hencea 
ural school board paying a continuation school teacher a salary of $700 might expect 
receive under ordinary circumstances annual grants from township, county, and 
overnment, amounting to $750. If the salary were $800 the grants would be not 
ss than $800 as arule. Then there is a source of considerable revenue in fees paid 
y pupils, the usual fee being $1 per month per pupil. This is a charge that is very 
‘illingly met by parents who appreciate the advantages of a continuation school. 
t present there are 128 continuation schools employing 185 teachers and attended 
'y pupils from 920 school sections. The number of pupils enrolled during first 
alf of the past year was 4,164, and during second half year, 4,400. The average 
mtinuation school could therefore depend upon having a roll of not less than 22 
upils per teacher, and a regular attendance that would yield a revenue of $150 per 
ar in fees. Thus it may be seen that under ordinary circumstances a continuation 
hool may be maintained in the average rural school section without adding directly 
the taxation of the section. Where a section is central, in some special way, to 
veral surrounding sections it is the more desirable that the school board of that 
ction should use its position of vantage by leading in the establishment of a con- 
uation school. 
The purpose to make special provision for agricultural instruction 
ough the agency of continuation schools is indicated by a clause 
the act providing that— 
‘Where an agricultural department is established by the minister in a continuation 
ool, the council of the county in which the continuation school is situated shall, 
or before the 15th day of December in each year, pay to the board of the school 
which such department is established the sum of $500 which shall be applied by 
board to the purposes of such department. 
It is interesting also to note in this connection that the amended 
blic schools act of Ontario provides that— 
‘he council of a township may engage the services of a person holding the degree 
achelor of science of agriculture or other certificate of qualification from the Ontario 
ricultural College and approved of by the certificate of the minister or of an instruc- 
qualified as required by the regulations, to give instruction in agriculture, manual

training, and household science in the public schools of the municipality, and the 
council may levy and collect from the ratepayers of such municipality who are public 
school supporters, such sums as may be necessary to pay the salaries of such instructors, 
and all other expenses connected therewith. 
And further, that— 
The board of a rural school section or of a union school section or a number of 
such boards may severally or jointly engage the services of any person qualified [a: 
explained above] for the purpose of giving similar instruction to the pupils of theii 
respective schools.     
      
     
          
    
    
   
   
       
        
   
        
    In Ontario, the entire scheme of technical education is under th 
direction of a special inspector included in the official staff of th 
education department. This officer has made an extensive study o 
the industries of the province with a view to adapting the technica 
training to the actual conditions surrounding the pupils, after th 
preliminary course in manual work and drawing in the lower grade! 
of the public schools is finished. As a result of this investigation, thi 
inspector advises that a system of vocational training be organize 
parallel with the last two years of the public school course and wit! 
the high school course, as a means of fitting the boys industriall. 
inclined for entrance upon the trades of their respective localities. 
Quebec.—Industrial training is included in the educational theori 
of several religious orders which have maintained schools in the Pro 
ince of Quebec, and the recent awakening of general interest in t 
subject accords, therefore, with the course that has been pursued, 
some extent, in their schools. Public action in the matter is no 
directed to the systematic treatment and wider extension of t! 
order of training. In his report for 1908-9, the superintendent 
public instruction notes an increase in school gardens, which reach 
a total of 132, distributed among five counties, and an increase in t! 
number of ‘‘ young gardeners” from 2,200 in 1908 to 3,789 in 190 
Attention is also called in the report to the two technical scho 
recently established by the government in Quebec and Montre 
respectively. These schools are intended to meet pressing industrij 
needs, and the hope is expressed by the superintendent that ‘‘traini 
schools for apprentices will also be established in manufacturing ce; 
ters, such as Sherbrooke, St. Hyacinthe, and others.’’ In this co) 
nection, the superintendent urges the importance of drawing as 
branch of instruction underlying all industrial and technical traini 
Although the education act of Quebec requires drawing to be taug 
in the public schools, in this respect the act is a dead letter, 
account, as the superintendent explains, of the want of compet 
inspectors, trained teachers, and well-defined methods of instructi 
New Brunswick.—The chief superintendent of education for N 
Brunswick reports 12 school gardens in operation in that province

promote an interest in agriculture through the medium of the schools. 
The report states that— 
a leaflet entitled, ‘‘Nature study and agriculture” has been supplied to all the schools 
with excellent results. Next year there will be in connection with the Normal School 
a garden such as will furnish our teachers with the idea of what may be accomplished 
in the ordinary country district, and very soon it is expected that a suitable text-book 
dealing with the whole subject will be prescribed. 
The director of manual training in this province reports steady 
progress in that branch and in the kindred subject of household sci- 
ence. Success in both depends almost entirely upon the services of 
special instructors, and experience shows that where such are em- 
ployed their influence extends far beyond the particular schools in 
which they are engaged. For instance, it is stated by the director 
that— 
in Sackville, where all the senior boys and girls are provided for in the fully equipped 
manual training and household science rooms, the manual training instructor, Mr. 
(Peacock, has organized a course in hand work throughout the lower grades. The 
instruction is given by the regular grade teachers, who are most enthusiastic in the 
work, under the guidance and supervision of Mr. Peacock. 
Nova Scotia.—The report of the superintendent of education in 
ova Scotia shows marked appreciation of schools having manual 
raining departments. In the section of mechanics there was an 
crease from 1,824 pupils in 1908 to 2,082 in 1909, and in the section 
f domestic science corresponding increase from 2,881 to 3,347. 
The measures adopted in this province for promoting special forms 
f technical and industrial training already provide for three orders 
f instruction suited to different industrial demands. The lowest 
tage is represented by the trade classes, which are opened in the 
vening and pertain as a rule to a special trade. An example is 
fforded by a class in Halifax, organized in accordance with the views 
f “a special committee from the Halifax Merchant Tailors’ and Cut- 
ers’ Association.”’ The report states that—     
        
   
   
                  
    
    
    
     
      
            
    
    e Merchant Tailors’ and Cutters’ Association promised their hearty cooperation; a 
ublic-spirited manufacturing clothier promised to provide the materials and to dis- 
ose of the finished product; the association agreed to find a competent instructor. 
he department of technical education furnished a room with a manufacturing type 
wing machine, press boards, gas and electric irons, and tables on which to lay out 
d make up work. 
Local technical schools were provided for by an act of 1906, which 
uthorized ‘‘the council of public instruction in any industrial com- 
unity, upon the recommendation of the director of technical educa- 
on,”’ to establish such a school provided that the “locality itself 
ould contribute in the support of the school;’’ also, that— 
6 government supplies the scientific apparatus necessary to carry on the work, and 
ill bear half the cost of instructors if the locality supplies the rooms, heat and light, 
d bears the other half of the cost of instructors.

The management of these local schools is in the hands of a managing committee, 
which consists of members of the school board, local manufacturers, foreman in the 
local shops, and representatives of the trades unions. On every committee a few men 
took an active interest in the schools and gave the movement impetus by visiting the 
classes frequently and offering practical suggestions for greater efficiency.     
    
    
        
    
        
     
     
    
     
    
   
   
   
   
     Schools of this type have been carried on “‘in the four chief manu- 
facturing centers of the province, viz, Amherst, Halifax, New Glasgow, 
and Sydney.” 
The coal-mining schools, as explained in the superintendent’s| 
report, 
are conducted with the purpose of teaching the special science and mathematics 
applied to this basal industry and modern practice in coal mining. * * * Thesub- 
jects range from fractions in arithmetic to trigonometrical functions of angles and plan 
surveying. Inaddition there are also taught English composition, geology, elemen' 
electricity, elementary mechanics, mechanical drawing, and modern mining practice. 
At the present time nearly every colliery town in the province has its evenin; 
school, where instruction as outlined above is offered. In each school are held pre- 
paratory classes in arithmetic and English composition. Ifthe student has a fair work, 
ing knowledge of arithmetic through decimals and can express his thoughts in writin 
as accurately as a pupil in theseventh grade, he is allowed to enter the regular coal 
mining classes. These preparatory classes are attended by many young boys wh 
merely wish more general education and who do not intend to enter the coal-minin; 
classes at all. 
The men who take up the more technical instruction usually do so with the intentio: 
of taking the examinations given under the auspices of the provincial government fi 
certificates of competency as colliery managers, underground managers, or overme: 
It is customary to take the examination for overman one year, then the examinatioi 
for underground manager, and then take one or two years more to acquire their ma: 
ager’s certificate. 
The classes are held almost altogether in the evening, but in Springhill, Glace Ba: 
Westville, and Sydney mines, instruction is given in the daytime to men who are pe! 
manently on night shift. 
The instructors in coal mining are engaged permanently by the department 
technical education and spend their whole time and effort in teaching the technic: 
classes connected with this industry. These men have had years of practical expei 
ence in positions of responsibility, and besides being actual coal miners have educ: 
tional qualifications that fit them for teaching. They conduct the evening classes 
well as special day classes in the public schools. 
Assistant instructors are appointed to hold classes in special localities which can n 
be visited by the regular instructors on account of inaccessibility or because there 
more applications for classes from a certain district than the instructor can possib! 
hold. 
Other provinces—Reports from the remaining provinces indica 
interest in the subject of manual training, and also in the promoti: 
of school gardens and of practical training in agriculture; but t! 
demand for these subjects is less pressing than in the provinces abo 
considered. In his report for 1909, under the head of ‘‘Special su 
jects of instruction,” the chief superintendent of education for Prin 
Edward Island observes that ‘‘manual training and agriculture ha: 
now been taught in the Prince of Wales College and in a few of t. 
 
-P-A-G-E-379
  EDUCATION IN CANADA, 371 
schools for a number of years, while domestic science has more recently 
been added to the curriculum;” but the majority of the school dis- 
tricts are indifferent to these subjects, and in his opinion ‘‘legislation 
jis necessary to provide due support for such training, as voluntary 
action is not forthcoming.” He adds: ‘‘If the government would 
lonly establish at certain centers, say, the first-class schools or a few of 
them, departments of agriculture, domestic science, and manual train- 
g, with a few acres of land for experimental purposes, it would be 
ossible to make agriculture a living subject of instruction and oppor- 
unity would be available for conducting in earnest classes in the two 
ther subjects.” 
The newer provinces are fully alive to modern demands; but their 
esources are taxed to furnish the fundamental conditions of efficient 
chool systems, teachers, and buildings, for both of which liberal pro- 
ision is made. British Columbia reports manual training schools in 
ew Westminster, Vancouver, and Victoria, and the inspector of this 
ranch advises that it may be made compulsory where ‘‘there are 
sufficient boys to warrant a school being opened.” 
In Manitoba a special committee was recently appointed ‘‘to inves- 
igate the question of agricultural courses for secondary schools,” and 
fter extended inquiry into the work as carried on in other provinces 
nd in the United States the committee advise that ‘‘every high school 
the province should be given the privilege of establishing a high- 
chool course in agriculture, to be carried on parallel with the exist- 
g courses for teachers’ certificates and for matriculation in the 
iversity.”” 
In Edmonton, the capital of Alberta, the school population, it is 
laid, has been doubling every three years for the past ten or twelve 
ears, and it requires great effort to keep up with the increasing edu- 
ational needs of the population. Nevertheless, the school board of 
e city is making liberal plans for secondary education The recently 
ected high-school building in that city has excellent equipment for 
boratory instruction, for manual training, and for a household- 
ience department. This building occupies a portion of a valuable 
te recently secured by the board on which it is proposed in the near 
ture to erect a building for an advanced manual training or tech- 
ical school. 
Sprrir or THE New Departures. 
The importance of the recent departures in public education in 
nada lies not so much in the tangible results as in the spirit awakened 
the effort. The practical branches of instruction, whether manual 
ts, nature study, or agriculture, have not been approached from 
he occupational point of view,” to quote a phrase from Professor 
iley, but ‘‘from the educational and spiritual.” This large con-

   872 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
ception of the subject was emphasized by Doctor Robertson during 
a recent visit to England in an address before the national meeting 
of the county council associations—that is, the assemblage of the local 
educational authorities of the kingdom. 
The subject of Doctor Robertson’s address was ‘‘Canadian methods 
of education for the improvement of rural conditions.’ He said in 
part: 
They had worked at the problem asa human one rather than as one of land or o! 
crops or of profits. Those who attacked it as a human problem had far more succes 
than those who made it merely a calculation of crops. He knew of one illustratio 
school for the improvement of rural conditions—a fine building, the children’s hom 
of the locality, not merely a schoolhouse, but the pride of the place, as it ought t 
be, with a school garden of the right sort, provision also for the teaching of house 
hold science and of manual training—and he had seen children there picking flowers 
rolling on the grass, and climbing the apple trees. That was the sort of thing h 
wanted all over. 
* * * * * * * 
Agriculture was not breaking clods nor moving soil, nor even gathering and sellin; 
crops. It was the case of old mother earth as a home for the race. Not only an occu 
pation for profits, but a great public interest, a national business, having direct bear, 
ings on the real and most lasting welfare of the people. It was not a question of gettin; 
agriculture into the common school, but of getting the common school founded oi 
agriculture. The three great maternal occupations were farming, home-making, ani 
the teaching of children, and all general education should be for these, for they nu 
tured the rest. All schools should have some nature study, some household scienc 
some manual training, and just as much reading, writing, and arithmetic as they ha 
time for. The people of the towns were equally concerned in agriculture with thos 
who lived on the land, and the great task was to make this earth a better home fi 
better children. Agriculture appealed to the highest in man, and he would respon 
whatever his rank in life. He had never found any satisfaction in appealing to th] 
farmer from the point of view of getting an extra 10 bushels per acre, but if he coul 
show him that his child’s weal was concerned it was always a strong appeal. He hay 
seen a school garden with fathers and mothers round it as thick as bees on a young cro) 
Having evidently in mind the prejudices of English authoritie 
against government interference in local affairs, Doctor Robertso 
drew a pertinent lesson from the policy of the Dominion governmen 
The Federal Government, although it could not spend money on education, mai 
tained a system of experimental farms and carried on excellent research work, whi 
was a national service. It maintained a series of illustration stations which help 
their poultry and dairying immensely, a branch for the protection of the health 
animals, and gave illustrations of the value of using good seed. It kept a corps 
workers for the extension of markets, a corps of inspectors at the seaports to see th: 
perishable goods were stored safely, and inspectors at Liverpool to see them proper! 
discharged. 
The provincial governments had charge of education; they maintained expe 
mental farms and agricultural colleges which affected the work in the schools. T! 
governments had done a great deal of valuable educational work for ‘‘grown ups| 
He had never known a man too old to be susceptible to educational influences if on| 
they appealed to his imagination and his pride. Both federal and provincial govei 
ments gave aid to the adult population in work. Financial aid in rural education 
being increased because it paid. In 1890 he set to work with £1,000 for dairyii

    That had now grown to £60,000, and other grants had grown similarly. In 1900 the 
value of all field crops was £42,000,000, in 1909 it was £109,000,000. Some of this was 
no doubt due to emigration and migration; but would there have been any of either if 
there had been no methods of helping the people to do well? He could remember the 
time when people migrated /rom instead of to the Northwest. The improvement 
was really due to the education of the grown-ups, to research, and to illustrations. 
* * * * * * * 
The whole idea of their system was to shift the emphasis from the study of subjects 
for the passing of examinations to the training of the pupils into ability for the work of 
life, particularly in rural occupations, in homes and in schools. They must provide 
the stimulus of physical facts for the grown-ups while modifying the training of the 
young. They had to train the faculties of thinking, acting, and loving, and if in these 
things they kept the people close to them they would have an enthusiastic following. 
Royat Commission on InpusrriaL EpucarTion. 
The most significant sign of the new influences that are shaping 
education in Canada is the recent order in council appointing a royal 
commission to investigate industrial training in the leading countries 
of America and Europe. 
This action was taken in accordance with the request of the pre- 
miers of the several provinces who express the conviction ‘‘that indus- 
trial efficiency is all-important to the development of the Dominion 
and to the promotion of the home and foreign trade of Canada in 
competition with other nations, and that industrial efficiency can be 
est promoted by the adoption in Canada of the most advanced sys- 
ems and methods of industrial training and technical education.” 
The following particulars relating to the members of the commis- 
ion® are cited from the Toronto Globe of June 3, 1910: 
Professor Robertson, the chairman of the commission, is one of the best known educa- 
ionalists of the Dominion. As commissioner of agriculture for the Dominion Professor 
obertson had much to do with shaping the splendid work of the department of agri- 
ulture, and his exceptional constructive ability was recognized and found expression 
in the establishment of Macdonald College at Ste. Anne de Bellevue, of which until 
ecently he has been the principal. To Professor Robertson, perhaps more than any 
ther single individual, has been due the progress which has been made in the intro- 
‘uction of manual training in the different schools. 
* * * * * * * 
Hon. John N. Armstrong, who will represent the maritime provinces on the commis- 
ion, has been a member of the legislative council of Nova Scotia since 1889, isa barrister 
y profession, and one of the best informed of the public men of eastern Canada. 
Dr. George Bryce, who will represent the west, is also one of the leading educational- 
ts of the Dominion. He was the founder of Manitoba College, is a member of the 
anitoba board of education, and is, perhaps, more fully acquainted with the history, 
ducation, people, and resources of western Canada than any other Canadian. Doctor 
ryce is president of the Royal Society of Canada.

M. Gaspard De Serres, who will represent the province of Quebec, is president of the 
new Technical Institutein Montreal. He isa well-known financier and philanthropist, 
a man of sound judgment. To him, as much as to any other man in the province, is 
owing the splendid progress already made in technical education in the Province of 
Quebec. 
The technical institute.—Technical institutes of the Province of Ontario will be repre- 
sented by Mr. David Forsyth, of Berlin, Ontario, principal of the Berlin Collegiate and 
Technical Institute. Mr. Forsyth is a graduate and medalist of the University of 
Toronto. It was due to Mr. Forsyth’s interest in the cause of technical education that 
Berlin became one of the earliest towns to establish technical work in connection with 
its collegiate.

At the present time it has the best equipment of any city or town school of Ontario, 
as is evidenced by the fact that the grants to the Berlin Collegiate and Technical 
Institute from the provincial government since 1904 have exceeded those of any other 
school. 
Labor and capital.—The two bodies that during recent years have been the most 
active in urging upon the Dominion government the necessity of appointing a commis- 
sion on technical education are the Canadian Manufacturers’ Association and the Domin- 
ion Trades and Labor Congress. In appointing Mr. Murray and Mr. Simpson on the 
commission the Dominion government has virtually given to these important bodies 
their own nominee. Mr. Murray has for some time past been the secretary of the Cana- 
dian Manufacturers’ Association. He has prepared and presented to the government 
several of the petitions of the manufacturers in reference to the necessity for the 
appointment of a technical education commission. His appointment has been 
strongly recommended by the members of the association. Being familiar with manu-| 
facturing interests of the Dominion generally, and in touch with leading manufacturers 
in all parts of Canada, it is doubtful if any person could have been found better fitted] 
to gain for the commission the views of the manufacturers as to their several needs. 
The same is true of Mr. Simpson as respects labor. Several years in succession hi 
has presented to the Dominion government on behalf of the Dominion Trades an 
Labor Congress of Canada the views of that body as respects the necessity for the appoint 
ment of a commission on technicaleducation. At its last meeting at Quebec the Domin. 
ion Congress unanimously concurred in the following resolution: ‘‘That this congr 
emphatically reaffirm its declarations in favor of the immediate appointment by th 
Dominion government of a commission on technical education, and that copies of thi 
resolution be immediately sent to the right honorable the prime minister and th 
minister of labor. Further, that this congress submits the name of Mr. James Simpson 
Toronto, with the request that they appoint him as the representative of the wag 
earners of Canada on the said commission, as he is eminently qualified to fill such 
position.” 
Apart from having the unanimous indorsation of the Dominion Trades and Labo} 
Congress, Mr. Simpson has, perhaps, a wider knowledge of the subject of technic: 
education and the needs of the workers in this connection than any other labor rep! 
sentative in the Dominion. He was a member of the technical education commissioi 
appointed by the board of education of Toronto a short time ago. At the present tim| 
he is chairman of the board of education of the city of Toronto and a member of tl 
technical education committee of the trustees’ section of the Ontario Educatioi 
Association. He is vice-president of the Social and Moral Reform Council of Canad: 
and for years past has held many important positions in connection with the lab 
movement. 
Mr. Thomas Bengough, who has been appointed secretary and reporter of the co: 
mission, is one of the best-known members of his profession in the Dominion. 
has, however, in addition to his exceptional qualifications as an expert repo
-P-A-G-E-383

special qualifications in connection with the present commission, having made the 
subject of technical education a special study, and being the author of an important 
publication containing the results of investigations personally conducted into methods 
employed in the teaching of manual training, industrial art, domestic science, and

Mepricat Inspection or ScHoots in British CoLUMBIA. 
An important measure, ‘‘The schools health inspection act, 1910,” 
was passed by the legislature of British Columbia and received the 
sanction of the King in September of the present year. The provi- 
sions of this act illustrate the large possibilities of such a measure, 
and also indicate the means by which local authorities may be held 
to their duties in regard to the general welfare without impairment 
of their rights. 
The act requires that ‘‘the school trustees of every city and of every 
rural municipality school district in the Province of British Columbia 
shall appoint one or more school health inspectors, and shall assign 
to each inspector the schools to be inspected, and provide them with 
proper facilities for the performance of their duties as health inspec- 
tors of schools and school children.” 
In districts outside of cities and rural municipalities the appoint- 
ment of school health inspectors rests with the provincial board of 
health. 
The school health inspectors must be duly certified physicians, 
authority, however, being granted to the provincial board of health 
to appoint other persons for certain parts of the service when it is 
deemed necessary. 
Every school health inspector is required to make a thorough 
“examination as to the general health of all children attending school 
in the district of which he is such inspector, and of all teachers and 
janitors in such district.’’ He must also ‘‘examine all school build- 
ings and school surroundings in his district, and report to the board 
lof school trustees, fully and in detail, the result of such examinations.” 
The board of school trustees are ordered to take such action upon 
he report of the health inspectors as may be deemed necessary to 
liminate all sources of danger arising from the condition of pupils or 
achers or from the insanitary conditions of the buildings. 
In addition to the general examination of children, the act requires 
hat— 
The school trustees of every school district in the province shall cause every child 
in the public schools to be separately and carefully tested and examined at least once  
-P-A-G-E-384

in every school year as to the condition of sight and hearing, of throat and teeth, and 
as to any other physical disability or defect liable to prevent his receiving the full 
benefit of his school work, or as to whether he requires a modification of the school 
work in order to secure the best educational results. The tests of sight and hearing 
may be made by teachers having authority from the provincial board of health. The 
school trustees shall cause notice of any such defect or disability requiring treatment 
to be sent to the parent or guardian of the child, and shall require a physical record of 
each child to be kept in such form as the provincial board of health shall prescribe. 
      
             
      
   
           
    
    
   
    It is-further required that children who may have been exposed to 
contagion shall be referred for further examination to a school health 
inspector, who, in such a case, must be a duly certified physician, and 
no child so referred ‘shall be permitted to return to school unless and 
until he delivers to the teacher in charge of the school a written certifi- 
eate, signed by the school inspector, permitting such return.” 
It is worthy of note, also, that the school health inspector is 
required to have supervision over physical exercises of pupils attend- 
ing school, and, in special cases, to modify or prohibit such exercises. 
The remuneration of health inspectors is charged upon the school 
district, and the duty of seeing that the health act is enforced rests 
upon the school trustees of each school district. 
In the case of schools in remote and isolated places the school 
trustees and teachers are authorized to make the best arrangements 
possible for the purposes of the act; the school boards of city and 
municipal school districts may pass by-laws and regulations for the 
better carrying out of the provisions of the act, but such by-laws and 
regulations must be approved by the provincial board of health before 
they become operative. 
All appointments made under the provision of this act are subject 
to the approval of the provincial board of health, and every year 
report must be made by the respective school board inspectors to th 
provincial board of health in such form as that body may require; an 
special reports on the health conditions of the children in any par. 
ticular school or schools may at any time be demanded by the boar 
of health. 
It is further ordered that ‘An annual report on school healt! 
inspection shall be prepared by the secretary of the provincial boar 
of health and submitted to the honorable the provincial secretary fo: 
presentation to the legislature every year.”

LATIN-AMERICAN COUNTRIES. 
   
   
    
   
            
            
     
    
    
      
    
   
   
    CENTENNIAL CELEBRATIONS. 
The scholastic year under review (1909-10) has been one of unusual 
nterest in the twenty Latin-American republics, because it marks for 
everal of the number the close of a century of national independence, 
nd the spirit awakened by the public celebrations of this event has 
pread to the States that have more recently attained independence. 
The significance to ourselves of these national movements may 
est be expressed by a citation from the first message of President 
aft to the Congress of the United States. After reference to the 
olitical relations between the sister republics and our own, the 
resident says: 
On July 9 next there will be open at Buenos Aires the Fourth Pan-American Con- 
rence. This conference will have a special meaning to the hearts of all Americans, 
ecause around its date are clustered the anniversaries of the independence of so many 
ff the American republics. It is not necessary for me to remind the Congress of the 
litical, social, and commercial importance of these gatherings. You are asked to 
ke liberal appropriation for our participation. If this be granted, it is my purpose 
appoint a distinguished and representative delegation, qualified fittingly to repre- 
nt this ‘country and to deal with the problems of intercontinental interest which will 
ere be discussed. 
The Argentine Republic will also hold, from May to November, 1910, at Buenos 
ires, a great international agricultural exhibition, in which the United States has 
een invited to participate. Considering the rapid growth of the trade of the United 
tes with the Argentine Republic and the cordial relations existing between the two 
tions, together with the fact that it provides an opportunity to show deference to a 
ter Republic on the occasion of the celebration of its national independence, the 
‘oper departments of this Government are taking steps to apprise the interests con- 
med of the opportunity afforded by this exhibition, in which appropriate partici- 
tion by this country is so desirable. The designation of an official representative 
also receiving consideration. 
* * * * * * * 
Beside the fundamental doctrines of our Pan-American policy there have grown 
a realization of political interests, community of institutions, and ideals, and a 
urishing commerce. All these bonds will be greatly strengthened as time goes on 
d increased facilities, such as the great bank soon to be established in Latin America, 
pply the means for building up the colossal intercontinental commerce of the future.

     The interest of the United States in efforts for the promotion of| 
friendly relations between the nations of the western continent was| 
shown by appropriations made by Congress during the session 0: 
1909-10, as follows: 
To meet the actual and necessary expenses of the delegates of the United States 
the Fourth International Conference of American States to be held at the city o! 
Buenos Aires, beginning on the ninth day of July, nineteen hundred and ten, and o: 
their clerical assistants, one hundred thousand dollars. 
To enable the Government to participate in the International Agricultural Exhibi. 
tion and the International Exposition of Fine Arts, to be held at Buenos Aires, Argen: 
tine Republic, beginning in May, nineteen hundred and ten, and to participate in th 
Exhibition of Fine and Applied Arts to be held at Santiago, Chili, beginning in Sep. 
tember, nineteen hundred and ten, and to provide for the compensation and expense: 
of commissioners thereto on the part of the United States, seventy-five thousan 
dollars. 
For the expenses of the commission to attend the celebration of the centennial of th 
Republic of Mexico, to be held in the City of Mexico in September, nineteen hund: 
and ten, ten thousand dollars. 
Three Latin-American Republics, Argentina, Chile, and Mexico] 
arranged for centennial celebrations on a large scale during 1910) 
Ecuador preceded these by an exposition held at Quito from Augus 
to November, 1909, which assumed an international characte 
Celebrations on a more limited scale took place also in other Stat 
of the group. 
The plans for these various events, by the place they gave t 
education, recalled the purposes that animated the founders of th| 
republics, and at the same time illustrated the present activity i 
respect to this interest. 
The elaborate preparations for the centenary celebration at Buen 
Aires included, besides the Pan-American Conference and the inte 
national agricultural exhibition mentioned in the President’s messag. 
other features related to education. Prominent among these featur 
was the International Fine Arts Exposition, which emphasized i 
various ways the great importance attached to art as a factor i 
national development, both by the Government and by wealt. 
citizens. In the announcements of the commission, it was stat 
that in the small private exhibitions held each year in Buenos Aire 
pictures and sculpture to the value of more than $200,000 are sol 
and that the National Government, the provincial governments, t: 
municipality of Buenos Aires and those of the principal cities of t 
country would be liberal purchasers of the works shown. 
The government interest in the fine arts is indicated by liber 
grants to the National Conservatory of Music the School of Dra’ 
ing, and the School of Art. 
The International Exhibition of Hygiene was held in connecti 
with the International Congress of Medicine in which eminent ph 
sicians from many different countries participated. The hygie:

      exhibit was planned with special reference to recent efforts for 
improving the sanitary condition of the capital. For this purpose 
the Argentine Congress in its last session authorized the President 
to expend 18,000,000 pesos.* : 
Chile celebrated its national centenary by an International Agri- 
cultural and Industrial. Exhibition which opened at Santiago, Sep- 
tember 18, 1910. Exhibits, both pictorial and statistical, indicated 
the relation of technical and scientific education to industrial pros- 
perity. 
As in that of the Argentine Republic, a feature of the Chilean 
celebration was an International Exposition of Fine Arts. This 
exposition was held in the newly erected Palace of Fine Arts which 
will remain as a permanent memorial of the occasion. It comprises 
the four sections of international, national, and retrospective national 
lart, and art as applied to industries. 
The centennial, for which the Government of Mexico made lavish 
rovision, commemorated the efforts of a hundred years ago, on the 
art of native patriots under the lead of the heroic priest Father 
iguel Hidalgo, to secure for Spanish citizens born in Mexico the 
ame political rights that were enjoyed by immigrants constantly 
rriving from Spain. This endeavor is regarded as the initial 
vent in the series of struggles which ended with the establishment 
f the Republic in 1857. 
It was decided by the national commission in charge of the cen- 
ennial arrangements to use the funds at their disposal for perma- 
ent works of national importance, and the month of September 
as practically given over to dedicatory exercises in the City of 
exico. 
The ceremonies relating particularly to education, as announced 
the programme issued by the commission, were as follows: 
September 2: Opening of the hygiene exposition under the aus- 
ices of the superior board of health, showing the progress of Mexico 
hygiene and sanitation from 1810 to 1910. 
September 6: Flag parade by school children. 
DEDICATIONS. 
September 5: The new seismological station, by the minister of 
mento; the amphitheater of the National Preparatory School, by 
resident Diaz and the minister of education, Justo Sierra. 
September 7: Two new high schools in the Plaza de Villamil, by 
e minister of education. 
September 9: The new normal school for women.

September 22: The National University, literary and _ scientific 
festival, President Diaz-and Minister Sierra participating. 
Unusual interest attaches to the inauguration of the University 
of Mexico, which existed heretofore in an embryonic form represented, 
by the National Medical Institute, and special schools of jurispru- 
dence and science. The full scheme of the National University has 
not yet been published, but its inauguration in this eventful yea 
marks it as typical of the highest aspirations of national life. 
The United States was represented at the centennial ceremonies b: 
a delegation appointed by President Taft, consisting of General Curti: 
Guild, Jr., former governor of Massachusetts, and eleven special 
representatives. General Guild bore the title of ambassador extraor. 
dinary to Mexico and the other members of the delegation the titl 
of ministers plenipotentiary. 
Epvucationat Notes. 
While in many respects the Latin-American countries have marke: 
individuality, they show in regard to education many common char. 
acteristics. Primary education is not widely diffused in any one o 
the States as would be inferred from both the official statistics o 
primary education and the high ratios of illiteracy. But in esti 
mating this condition it is necessary to keep in mind the social cus 
toms and traditions inherited from the Spanish ancestry, the long 
continued political disturbances, the general state of the agricultur: 
regions, as well as the mixed character of much of the populatio 
Under such conditions it is impossible to secure general public senti 
ment or support for popular education. Outside of the chief citie 
what has been done to promote the interest, even in the most progres: 
ive of the Latin-American States, is the work of leaders who have kep| 
steadily in view the relation between popular intelligence and the we! 
fare of republics. 
The principal cities of these various States, and in particular th| 
capitals of the Argentine Republic, Chile, and Mexico, have at prese 
very good systems of public schools, many of which bear favorab 
comparison as regards grading, buildings, and standards with t! 
city schools of our own country. Professional training for teache 
is generally fostered, and the normal schools of Mexico, Bolivi 
Brazil, the Argentine Republic, and Chile are of a high character. 
Secondary education is maintained by both public and priva 
agencies and follows pretty closely the plan of the modern side of ti 
French lycée; in Chile, German models prevail. The secondai 
schools, colegios and liceos, are the schools of the directive classes ar

prepare students for admission to the highly: specialized university 
faculties. 
The most recent developments in public education relate to the es- 
tablishment of industrial and technical schools and the corresponding 
xtension of the scientific faculties of the universities. 
It is not the purpose here to present a complete survey of education 
n the countries considered,” but simply to bring together notes drawn 
om consular and official documents illustrating the activity in respect

          MEXICO. 
Consul Louis Hostetter writes that one of the greatest benefits accruing from the 
stablishment of peace with the Yaqui Indians has been the enlargement and better- 
ent of the public schools in the Mexican State of Sonora. Of the new institutions 
the city of Hermosillo, he says: 
“A short time ago a new school for boys was opened in a new building erected at a 
‘ost of $22,500 gold, and in February another new building for girls, Colegio de Nifias 
e Leona Vicario, was dedicated. It cost $32,500 and $10,000 for furnishings. It 
lontains 13 class rooms, also 8 for library, gymnasium, music, etc. Domestic science, 
wing, etc., are to betaught. The governor announced at the opening exercises that as 
e Yaqui troubles were at an end, it was the object of the officials to improve the school 
stem in every manner possible, and that any improvements suggested by the princi- 
al or school board would be adopted; in fact, the idea was to make the schools of the 
tate of Sonora the best and most advanced in the Republic. Money formerly used 
s a war fund against the Yaquis is to be used for the improvement of the schools. 
nother school is to be erected at a cost of $32,500, or more if necessary. There is an 
tendance of over 2,300 scholars in Hermosillo, and the schools are maintained at a 
st of $40,000.”” : 
Consul L. J. Keena states that an appropriation of $7,500 United States currency 
s been made by the Chihuahua state legislature for establishing a state reform school 
yr youthful vagrants and criminals, who will be taught scientific agricultural methods. 
is hoped by this instruction to make them industrious citizens. The school will be 
uated about 17 miles from the city of Chihuahua. 
Medical inspection of schools in the federal district of Mexico was 
ovided for in a decree of July 1, 1896, organizing the general direc- 
ion of primary instruction. In 1902 this service was extended to 
rmal schools, and in 1908 the service was reorganized and greatly 
tended. The general plan of this service and its methods and re- 
Its, so far as these can be set forth by diagrams, tables, and official 
culars, formed a very interesting feature of the Third International 
mgress on School Hygiene, held at Paris from the 2d to the 7th of 
gust of the present year.

CENTRAL AMERICA. 
In the movement for a closer union of the five States comprised in 
Central America, Costa Rica is rapidly assuming leadership, a fact 
that was emphasized by the choice of the site for the Palace of Peace, 
the gift of Andrew Carnegie, intended to mark in a signal manner the 
dawn of a new era in Central American affairs. The palace, which was 
erected in Cartago, was unfortunately destroyed by the earthquak 
disaster which occurred on May 4, 1910, but the donor has alread: 
indicated his purpose of renewing the gift. 
At the second Central American Conference, which was held a 
San Salvador February 1 to 5 of the present year, a conventio: 
was signed providing for the establishment in Costa Rica of a peda 
gogic institute for Central America, and in accordance with thi 
convention a suitable location for the buildings of the institute wa: 
selected in the vicinity of the city of Baba, and plans for the erectio 
of the same are in progress. The choice of Costa Rica for a central 
institution_of this kind is a fitting recognition of the progress o 
public instruction in this state. For primary schools alone th 
Government appropriates about $325,000 annually, or an averag 
of $12 per capita of enrolled pupils; special appropriations have als 
recently been made for industrial education. According to offici 
orders, issued in 1909, arrangements were made for establishin 
“preparatory schools of arts and crafts (Escuelas Preparatorias d 
Artes y Oficios) and schools of domestic instruction for women i 
the various provincial capitals.” 
The State of Guatemala has been particularly active in providin 
for the study of English in the public schools and, it is reported, h: 
recently arranged for teaching this subject by the use of the phon 
praph.* 
Honduras is endeavoring to secure a better class of teachers f 
its primary schools by making increased appropriations for t 
salaries of teachers. The National School of Medicine has recent 
been put upon a firm financial basis, and it is hoped that it may so: 
recover its former prestige. About 25,000 pesos are annually spe 
to support students of engineering and other practical professio: 
in the United States, Mexico, and Europe. 
The minister of public instruction of Nicaragua, in a recent repo 
deplores the low condition of primary education in the Republi 
Five times as many schools, he declares, are required as have be 
provided, in order to meet the actual needs of the population. The

school for young women in Managua. The enrollment was 876, wil

    an average attendance of 788, or 90 per cent of the enrollment. The 
State pays at the rate of $5 a month for each pupil. 
The programmes of the several secondary schools are all nonclassical. 
The course in the normal school includes methodology, pedagogy, 
Spanish, mathematics, zoology, botany, drawing, physical sciences, 
and singing. Higher education is represented by three faculties of 
law, which had, in 1908, an attendance of 28 students, and by the 
aculty of medicine and surgery, which had 11 professors and 26 
tudents. The law course is very comprehensive, including philos- 
phy of law, civil, comparative, and constitutional law, criminal law 
nd criminology, medical law, statistics, and academic courses in 
panish and American literature, in history and political economy. 
There is an agreement with other Central American states by 
irtue of which degrees granted in any one of them are recognized 
n Nicaragua as of equal weight with its own. Possessors of degrees 
anted in foreign countries must pass a brief examination and 
rove the authenticity of the degrees. Twelve young Nicaraguans 
ere selected for education in other countries in 1908 at the expense 
f the State. Of these, five were sent to Chile, six to the United 
tates, and one to Italy. 
The Government of El Salvador maintains a system of national 
rimary schools which are intended to be models for those sup- 
orted by cities and departments. The National University com- 
rises faculties of medicine, pharmacy, natural sciences, dental sur- 
ery, a school of law, and a school of engineering. The Government 
so maintains a National School of Agriculture and a practical school 
if arts and trades. 
PANAMA. 
In Panama the control of education is centralized in the National 
overnment. The capital city is the seat of several important insti- 
tions, among them a National School of Music and Declamation, 
e of Arts and Trades, a National Museum, and a Municipal Library. 
e lately established National Institute comprises a normal school, 
high school for boys, a business college, and a college of languages. 
e State bears the expense of the professional education of 62 stu- 
nts (47 boys and 15 girls) in the colleges of the United States and 
rope. Recently the Government has secured permission from the 
inited States to establish at different places in the Canal Zone 
lhools for both sexes of Panamanians. These schools are to be 
ught by natives, and the expenses to be borne by the state treasury.

    children of school age and the children enrolled in school is carefully 
kept, and, in order to prevent the waste of time and effort on the 
part of pupils, from their enforced transfer from school to school 
through the shifting of the laborers, attempts are made to unify the 
courses of study in all the primary schools of the zone. In March, 
1909, these schools numbered 29, scattered in 21 towns along the 
line of the canal from Panama to Colon. Of the total number, 12 
schools were for white children, with an enrollment of 675, and 17 
for colored children, with an enrollment of 1,417. 
Two high schools were provided during the year, one at Culebra and one at Cris- 
tobal. Children at other points in the zone requiring high-school instruction were 
provided with transportation over the railroad by the commission to attend school 
lat those two points. Instruction was given in algebra, geometry, physical geography, 
general history, botany, English, German, French, Spanish, and Latin. The normal 
mount of work carried by each high-school pupil was four subjects. The total enroll- 
ent of high-school pupils during the year was 25 children. 
Experiments were made with school gardens at a few points and met with sufficient 
uccess to warrant their establishment next year at every school where there is 
vailable ground. The only expense attending their establishment is the cost of 
ences and water connections. 
In some of the schools the teaching of Spanish has been extended down from the 
igh school and seventh and eighth grades to the fifth with success, probably due 
in a large measure to the opportunity pupils have of speaking the language outside 
f school hours. 
In January arrangements were made with the sanitary department for a monthly 
edical examination of the pupils in the white schools, and each child was examined 
mee during the year for eye, ear, nose, and throat trouble. 
The following summary of a report by the superintendent of 
chools is taken from the Canal Record: 
In his report for October the superintendent of schools states that more than half 
ff the teachers in the schools for white children are graduates from universities or 
ormal schools in the States. There are 35 teachers for the schools for white children, 
ind of this number 12 hold A. B. degrees, and 11 certificates from normal schools, 
hile all of the teachers have had two or more years of successful experience in the 
tates or the Canal Zone. 
“So far as my experience extends I feel that the zone system of schools will not 
fier by comparison with any in the States of like size. Personal inspection of all 
e white schools, and reports made by supervisors, justify the belief that inadequate 
hool facilities are not among the sacrifices made by families who come to the Canal 
lone. There is some inefficient teaching, but not more than is to be found in any 
‘stem of this size.” 
Three high schools are maintained at the present time—one at Cristobal with an 
tendance of 20 pupils, one at Gatun with 8 pupils, and one at Culebra with 15 
pils. Of the total number of pupils 11 are being transported to Cristobal and 11 
Culebra. 
The superintendent states: 
“As to the quality of the work, no disparagement is meant the teachers when I 
ry that it is not such as will be accepted by the leading colleges and universities 
the States. None of the higher schools of any standing will accept work done in

   high schools with less than three teachers, all of whom must devote their time to 
the teaching of high-school subjects.” 
To overcome the disadvantages presented by maintaining three small schools, and 
so dissipating the energies of the teachers by obliging them to teach in all depart- 
ments, to make it possible to establish a good working library at small cost, and to 
gain for the high school the advantage of the school enthusiasm that comes with 
numbers, it is recommended that the high schools be concentrated in one school at 
Cristobal with a half-day session beginning at 1.15 o’clock and closing at 4.15 o’clock 
in the afternoon. The children from points along the line would go to Cristobal on 
the train leaving Panama at 10.45 in the morning and return on the train leaving 
Colon at 4.30 in the afternoon. The superintendent states that “the certificate of 
such a school would be honored anywhere, and the arrangement would give the 
zone a system from the first grade up as complete and as thorough as any in the 
States.” 
Answering an inquiry as to the feasibility of compulsory education in the Canal 
* Zone, the superintendent says that such a law would operate principally among the 
non-American children, and that the present appropriation is inadequate to meet 
the demands that would be made by enforcing the law. He believes, however, that 
there are urgent social reasons why the Government should enact a compulsory educa- 
tion law, as the social future of the Canal Zone depends largely upon the future| 
generations of the natives and the negroes living here. With this idea in view the| 
course of study in the schools for colored children has been reorganized, with thi 
end of laying more stress on industrial than cultural work. Reading, writing, spell- 
ing, the fundamentals of arithmetic, hygiene, and language now constitute th 
curriculum in the colored schools. Some American history and geography are given, 
but as reading lessons, not as history or geography lessons. In addition it is planne 
to do some elementary work in agriculture and horticulture. To this end the com: 
mission has been asked to appropriate small plats of ground near the Culebra building 
The superintendent of schools has been directed to prepare a report on the questioi 
of industrial education and institutions for the correction of juvenile offenders.¢ 
CUBA. 
The recent development of public instruction in Cuba is sufficien 
of itself to justify the events which led to the independence of th 
island. The work of organizing public instruction began unde 
American auspices. In 1904 there were reported 1,936 public school; 
with an enrollment of 143,085 pupils; in 1909 the pupils in publi 
schools numbered 196,122, an increase of 53,037 pupils, or 37 per cen| 
in five years. In the latter year there were also reported, outside 
the city of Habana, 305 private schools with an enrollment of 13,05 
pupils. This brings the total enrollment in elementary schools t 
209,172, or very nearly 10 per cent of the population, the highe: 
proportion reached by any one of the Latin-American countries. 
is worthy of note, also, that whereas formerly few schools were foun 
outside the principal cities—Habana, Matanzas, Santiago de Cub: 
and their immediate suburbs—at present the schools and pupils 
very well distributed throughout the island. This fact appears b 
the comparison of the enrollment with the population as in the tab 
accompanying the map on the following page.

   The efforts to extend elementary education have had a stimulating 
effect upon secondary schools which, even in Habana, were disor- 
ganized during the long period of revolutionary struggles. The six 
provincial institutes which maintain courses of instruction leading to 
the bachelor’s degree are now aided from the public treasury, and 
the salaries of professors have been materially increased. The Uni- 
versity of Habana reports for 1909 a total of 634 students, many of 
whom were enrolled in more than one faculty. 
According to the decree of the military governor of Cuba, bearing 
date June 23, 1899, and still in force, graduates of foreign institu- 
tions, in order to practice their respective professions in Cuba, must 
present their degrees to the department in charge of public instruc- 
tion, and the said degrees will be registered by the University of 
Habana when the applicant has fulfilled certain requirements. After 
the degree has been registered, the applicant, upon the payment of 
the necessary fees, which are fixed at $35 in United States money or 
its equivalent, must pass an examination which is conducted by a 
board of five professors, three of whom, at least, must belong to the 
faculty corresponding to the profession which the candidate desires 
to pursue. This order accords fully with the purpose of the Cuban 
authorities to maintain the high professional standards which have 
been set by the University of Habana. 
ARGENTINE REPUBLIC. 
The President of the Argentine Republic has issued a decree estab- 
lishing an important new educational institution in Buenos Aires, to 
be called the Higher Normal School (Escuela Normal Superior). Its 
plans are outlined by Consul-General R. M. Bartleman: 
The object of this new school is to provide more teachers for the various primary 
and secondary schools, which are in constant need, with the rapid growth of the 
school population, of more trained educators. The course in the new school is three 
years. Only graduates of normal schools or those who have completed similar studies 
may enter it. The course is very complete, especial stress being laid on mathematics 
and the sciences, on the history and science of education, and on the art of teaching. 
By another decree the President is authorized to establish rural normal schools 
for both sexes at San Justo, in the province of Santa Fe; Victoria, in the province of 
Entre Rios; Dolores, in the province of Cordoba; De la Banda, in the province of 
Santiago del Estero; Chilecito, in the province of La Rioja; Rosario de la Frontera, in 
the province of Salta; and at Resistencia, in the territory of the Chaco. It has also} 
been stated that a normal school would soon be established at some point in the ter-| 
ritory of the Chubut, probably at Puerto Madryn. President Alcorta emphasizes in| 
this decree the urgent necessity of providing the rural districts with adequatel 
trained teachers, and of devoting more attention to children of school age in outlyin, 
districts. These new normal schoolsare to be organized and opened as soon as possible 
The present minister of public instruction, Dr. Rémulo S. Naén, is extremel 
anxious to bring the teaching staff of the Republic to a high state of efficiency, thi 
being a part of his programme of educational reform; and the creation of these ne 
normal schools is understood to be part of a plan now being worked out toward thii

lend. It will be remembered that the first normal schools in Argentina were founded 
by teachers brought from the United States by President Sarmiento. 
Consul-General R. M. Bartleman reports that the large modern 
hree-story building of the Government Industrial School in Buenos 
ires, completed at a cost of $1,000,000 Argentine paper ($424,600 
mited States currency), was opened on May 24, and over 500 pupils 
re receiving instruction. This new building is completely equipped 
ith apparatus for practically teaching nearly all mechanical employ- 
ents, instruction also being given in some branches of electricity. 
ts chemical laboratory and scientific library are both good. 
SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF AMERICAN STUDENTS. 
On July 15, 1910, the Second International Congress of American 
tudents, organized by the University Federation, convened in 
uenos Aires. In the discussions of the congress special emphasis 
as placed upon subjects pertaining to the medical profession, 
cluding the equipment required by the medical schools to meet 
lhe remarkable advance in medical science and the conditions for 
dmission to the practice of the profession. 
Mr. C. H. Sherrill, president of the United States University Club 
t; Buenos Aires, reports that he held a reception in the legation offices, 
in the night of July 16, in honor of the Congress of American Students 
which he had been accredited as a delegate by Yale University. 
his reception was attended by the legation staff, delegates to the 
udents’ congress, and representatives of different South American 
iversities as well as of many universities of our own country. On 
count of the small representation of delegates to the congress 
om the United States, Mr. Sherrill was authorized to appoint dele- 
tes from resident graduates, and accordingly a company of dele- 
tes, almost all natives of Argentina, was made up, representing 21 
erican colleges and universities. This action proved to be a very 
ppy incident in the proceedings of the congress, as it not only 
creased the number of colleges represented but made a strong impres- 
n of the cordial spirit of fraternity between the South American 
aduates and their colleagues from this country. 
An interesting feature of the centennial celebration in Buenos 
res was a series of lectures delivered in that city by M. Clemenceau 
e former premier of France) on the history of democracy from . 
le earliest times to the American Declaration of Independence. 
his first lecture M. Clemenceau aptly discriminated between the 
ractical Anglo-Saxon democracy of North America and the 
alist Latin democracy of South America’ and expressed the 
pe that the two would ‘‘continue their onward march, not with 
hostile intent against each other, but in a way which would 
imately bring them together.”

   MEDICAL INSPECTION AND PUBLIC HYGIENE. 
Medical inspection of schools is thoroughly organized in Buenos 
Aires and also in the city of La Plata. Preparation for the service 
of public hygiene is a particular feature of the government schools 
at Rosario. A very complete brochure on the subject was prepared 
for the International Exhibition of Hygiene at Buenos Aires, copies 
of which were forwarded to the International Congress on Hygiene 
at Paris. 
BOLIVIA. , 
The progress along educational lines in the Republic of Bolivia is 
indicated by the fact that whereas in 1904 the legislative appropria- 
tion for this service amounted only to 128,000 bolivianos, the budget 
for the present year amounted to 1,900,000 bolivianos, or more than 
ten times the earlier amount. In accordance with the resolutions 
adopted by the educational congress of 1908, the system of primary 
and secondary instruction has been put on a much firmer basis and 
the schools under local authority brought into closer conformity with 
the official programmes followed by the free national schools. The 
normal school founded in Sucre has already achieved international 
reputation. A college conducted in English, and known as ‘The 
American Institute,’ was established about four years ago at La Paz, 
This institution has proved so thorough and efficient, and has give 
such great satisfaction in regard to the mastery of English and moder: 
subjects, that the Government has decreed that its certificates o: 
diplomas shall admit the holders to the universities of the Republi 
without examination. 
BRAZIL. 
A presidential decree, dated September 23, 1909, authorizes th 
establishment of free industrial schools in the capitals of the States| 
In order to make industrial education more general throughout Brazil 
the Government offers to aid the state administrations, municipal 
governments, and private associations which shall establish trad 
schools. Trade schools are now established in the States of Piauh 
Maranhao, Rio Grande do Norte, Parahyba, Pernambuco, Alago 
Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Parana, Matto Grosso, and Rio Grand 
do Sul. 
CHILE. 
Chile has a well-organized system of public instruction under stron; 
central administration, and consequently the facilities for edtcatio 
are more uniformly distributed than in other states here considere: 
Agricultural education has been specially promoted by the “‘Socieda 
Nacional de Agricultura,” and the Government contributes liberal 
toward the maintenance of the same. The Agricultural Institu 
and the Industrial Agricultural School at Chillan are other estal

   lishments for practical agricultural instruction, and besides these the 
Government maintains a number of model farms and contributes 
largely toward the expenses of maintaining the Quinta Normal at 
Santiago, in which are comprised a museum, a zoological garden, and 
a number of experimental stations for the cultivation of trees, vines, 
etc. The National Agricultural Institute, situated at Santiago, 
maintains professorships in rural economy, arboriculture, viticulture, 
and vinification, agricultural chemistry, rural legislation, also a 
veterinary school. 
At Copiapo there is a practical school for mining, and at Santiago 
and La Serena are schools for practical instruction to mining engi- 
eers and miners. 
COLOMBIA. 
The Government of Colombia has begun the work of reorganizing 
he system of public instruction by appointing a committee to inves- 
igate the systems of foreign countries and by the establishment of 
ve additional normal schools—three for men and two for women. 
ach, of these schools is to be allowed a subvention of $400 a month, 
hich will serve as tuition fees for poor but promising students who 
hall have signified their intention of serving as public school teach- 
rs. The official programme for the normal schools is extensive and 
ncludes practical branches adapted to the different classes of stu- 
ents. A practice school is an adjunct of each of the normal schools. 
A congress of students of the three Republics which at one time 
onstituted the Great Colombia—that is to say, Colombia, Ecuador, 
nd Venezuela—was held in Bogota, capital of the Republic of 
‘olombia, from July 20 to August 7, 1910, in honor of the one hun- 
redth anniversary of the proclamation of national independence of 
olombia. The object of the congress was to strengthen and cement 
lhe relations of friendship and good will that now exist among the 
niversity students of the three Republics, to discuss educational 
nd scientific subjects of general interest, and to encourage the adhe- 
on of the educational centers of the three nations to the League of 
erican Students of Montevideo, Uruguay. Among the promi- 
ent subjects of discussion was that of the desirability and possibility 
the unification of university curricula and the value of college 
legrees. 
ECUADOR. 
The industrial awakening in Ecuador is indicated by the growing 
preciation of the importance of higher scientific and technical 
aining. During the year the Government sent about 100 young 
en to the different colleges and universities of the United States in 
der that they might prepare themselves to become civil, mechan- 
al, electrical, naval, and mining engineers. Another 100 were sent 
Europe for the same purpose.

       Higher education in Paraguay is provided in the University of 
Asuncion, which offers a six-year course in law, social science, and 
medicine; shorter courses in pharmacy and other technical. branches 
have recently been added. This university shows very plainly the 
influence of the French system, and relations between the students 
‘of the two countries have been promoted by the action of the French 
authorities in facilitating in various ways the admission of students 
from all the Latin-American countries into the educational institu- 
tions of Paris and of the Departments. 
PERU. 
Measures have recently been taken to enforce more rigidly the 
high standards of admission to the National School of Agriculture. 
The official orders on this subject prescribe that the ‘candidate for 
admission must be between 15 and 20 years of age, of good charac- 
ter, and of sufficient mental attainments to pass an examination on 
the primary subjects taught in the public schools.” 
Each Department is allowed a certain number of scholarships, the National Govern-| 
ment paying the necessary expenses, i. e., subsistence, lodgings, and laundry, and 
weekly stipend to such students as are fortunate enough to secure scholarships fro: 
their respective Departments. The instruction imparted in this school is of an emi 
nently practical kind, and the aim constantly kept in mind is that the graduates ar 
to be effective farmers, who on account of their familiarity with the most advance 
systems of agriculture, will become leaders in all matters of agricultural reform. 
An executive decree has recently been issued authorizing th 
attendance of teachers in the active service on special courses i 
methodology maintained in the normal schools. The decree als 
provides for the admission to the normal school for men of 50 da; 
pupils, 16 to 25 years of age, who pass the required examinations 
By this means it is hoped to increase the number of intending teach. 
ers and also to extend the influence of normal-school training. 
During the present year the Government appointed an educationa 
commission charged with the duty of preparing an educational bill 
to be presented at the next national congress.*

      mathematics, and social sciences. Recently there has been a marked 
increase in the enrollment in primary schools, and the Government 
has taken measures to so increase the number of these schools that 
there shall be one for every 1,000 inhabitants. The law requires 
that all teachers in state schools shall possess a good knowledge of 
the English language, and courses in the English language and 
literature are provided at the university. 
VENEZUELA. 
In a special report on primary education in Venezuela, the Ameri- 
can consul at La Guaira, Mr. Isaac A. Manning, states that at the 
lose of 1909 there were 1,543 primary schools in the State with an 
nrollment of 48,718 pupils. On this enrollment, a total average 
ttendance was maintained of 35,114, equivalent to 72 per cent of 
he enrollment. Of the entire number of pupils, 3,091 were above 
4 years of age. The number between 7 and 10 years was 17,945, 
nd between 10 and 12 years, 12,921. The Government maintains 
t Caracas the National Academy of Fine Arts, the School of Arts 
nd Trades, and the Central University; the University of Los 
ndes is situated at Merida. 
From the foregoing notes pertaining to education in the States of 
‘entral and South America certain tendencies are apparent. The 
igher education is drawing the representative men of the different 
tates into closer and closer relations and thus is making for political 
oncord; at the same time the industrial and commercial expansion, 
hich is not limited to a few States, has created a general demand 
r men of scientific and technical training to exploit the resources 
f the mineral regions and direct the vast and ever increasing agri- 
ultural enterprises. It is a hopeful sign that with this social and 
conomic activity, the imperative need of a wider diffusion of primary 
ducation is commonly recognized. The need is reiterated in the 
essages of presidents, in the reports of ministers of public instruc- 
fon, and in political addresses. It forms a leading subject in the 
irgan of the Central American Union which officially declares that— 
Without regard to differences of religious and political creeds or forms of govern- 
ent, modern society recognizes that the collective interest and the common and 
e individual welfare depend upon the development and perfection of general educa- 
ion. * * * For this reason no true republic can disregard the interests of public 
struction, and especially those of the elementary school, the indispensable institute 
r the masses, the radiating center of democratic principles and social fraternity.

PART I. TECHNICAL INSTRUCTION IN FRANCE, 
HISTORICAL REVIEW. 
The history of technical education in France, which covers more 
an a century, divides into three quite distinct periods. The first 
if these periods, extending from 1789 to the restoration of the Bour- 
ons, was marked by the creation of national institutions for utilizing 
e forces and furthering the conquests of science. Chief among these 
ere the Museum of Natural History, established in 1793; the Con- 
rvatoire National des Arts et Métiers and the Ecole Polytechnic, 
th created in 1794. 
The second period, extending from 1815 to the Franco-Prussian 
ar, was distinguished by private enterprise in this field of activity. 
signal example is afforded by the special School of Commerce and 
dustry founded at Paris in 1820 by two merchants of the city. 
fter a varying history of nearly fifty years the school was acquired 
the Paris Chamber of Commerce in 1869, since which date it has 
joyed uninterrupted prosperity. 
The precedent set by the School of Commerce excited similar efforts 
respect to other industrial interests and in 1829 a second technical 
: 395

  396 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
school, the Ecole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures was opened in 
Paris, also under private auspices. This school, which is still flourish- 
ing, began operations upon the eve of the Revolution of 1830, which 
gave the direction of public affairs to the bourgeois. ‘‘As a class,” 
says Proudhon, ‘‘the bourgeois prize comfort, luxury, the joys of 
life, in other words the possession of wealth.” Thus by habit and 
temper they were specially fitted to exploit the material resources of 
the country and to apply the resources of science and the new forces 
of steam and telegraphy to the uses of industry and trade; the brief 
period of their supremacy, 1830 to 1848, was marked by great indus- 
trial activity. 
Under the impulse of liberal ideas which brought about the second 
revolution, the social improvement of the masses became a matter of 
equal solicitude with their industrial training. The double purpose 
is illustrated by the scope of the Philotechnic Association, founded at 
Paris in 1848. Like the Polytechnic Association which dates from 
1830, the later society aimed to impart scientific and technical instruc- 
tion to the industrial classes by means of lectures and systematic les- 
sons. But the Philotechnic also placed stress on benevolent and 
social efforts for the young who were drawn, without adequate care} 
or protection, into the ranks of commerce and manufactures. The| 
work of these two societies, which are still in active operation, in. 
creased rapidly, and auxiliary branches were formed in all the chie 
cities of France. Both societies were in time recognized by specia. 
decrees as of public utility, the Polytechnic in 1869 and the Philo 
technic in 1879. As their subsequent history shows, both had th 
vigor of public agencies with the freedom and flexibility of privat 
bodies. ‘ 
The movement for industrial training was widely extended als 
by the trade unions, or syndicates of workmen, which multiplie 
rapidly after 1830. These associations were then, as they still con, 
tinue to be, centers of political and economic agitation in which soci 
and economic theories, those of Fourrier, Proudhon, etc., were pas 
sionately discussed. The leaders in these unions also worked to rais 
the standard of the arts and crafts which they represented, as man: 
of the principal trade schools of France attest by their crude begi 
nings in this period of unrest. 
The commercial importance of all this activity, and especially 
the prolonged and widely diffused efforts for the improvement of t 
artisan class in France, was signally shown by the London Expositio: 
of 1851. The attention of the world was here drawn to the artistij 
superiority of French manufactures, and as a consequence the year 
the coup d’état, which gave to the artistic industries of France ne 
impulse by the requirements of a luxurious court, brought also t 
added stimulus of foreign demands.

EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 397 
Thus, before the present Republic was created technical institutions 
f the higher order had been firmly established in France, and numer- 
us specialized trade schools were in vigorous operation. 
But, meanwhile, the industrial progress of the country was threat- 
med by the changed conditions of apprenticeship in the shops them- 
elves and a consequent decline of technical skill; the condition was 
eatly aggravated by the influx of people into the cities. In 1836 
here were but three cities in France with a population above 100,000; 
nm 1866 there were eight. The whole urban population which in 1846 
omprised one-fourth the population of France had risen in 1872 to 
early one-third. The need of new agencies to deal with the new 
onditions was recognized by M. Duruy, one of the greatest among 
he many able men who have served France as minister of public in- 
truction. He sought to turn the whole force of the system under his 
irection to the economic improvement of the nation. His practical 
leforms began with provision for the higher instruction in the sciences, 
ut his purpose embraced the entire scheme of public instruction. 
Without declassing any,’’ he says, ‘‘this should elevate all in their 
aried conditions, the workman in the fields and cities, by means of 
e primary schools; artisans, traders, and agriculturists, by means 
if special schools.”” The ministry of M. Duruy closed on the eve of 
e disastrous events which gave unexpected emphasis to his ideas. 
was in the midst of the siege of Paris that a school was opened by 
e mayor of the fifth arrondissement, for the purpose of providing 
ployment for the numerous children who were left without occu- 
tion, as well as for the teachers who had been compelled to with- 
aw from the suburbs of the city. The school survived the siege and 
der the advice of M. Salicis, inspector of public instruction, whose 
me it bears, it was taken over by the city as an experimental school 
r a proposed scheme of manual training. It offers at the present 
e the most complete illustration of manual training in elementary 
ades, although this has become a common feature of the elementary 
hools of the capital. Following soon after, came the second step in 
e municipal movement. In 1872, M. Gréard, at that time chief of 
e Paris system, submitted to the city council a proposition for the 
ening of a school for instruction in the wood and iron industries. 
is powerful advocacy carried conviction and the Ecole Diderot was 
le outcome. 
The success of the school was such that a special commission was 
pointed by the prefect of the Seine to investigate the subject and 
advise as to the means of supplying the increasing demand for 
ools of the new type. Other cities, Lyon, Havre, Rouen, etc., 
lowed the example of Paris, and an era of municipal activity in 
ard to technical instruction succeeded to that of private enterprise.

uary, 1878. The results of French industry, as displayed in th 
Paris Exhibition of that year, were held to be unsatisfactory. Cham. 
bers of commerce and leading manufacturers urged the matter upo 
the attention of the Government, and propositions looking to th 
creation of an independent, system of primary technical instructio 
were submitted to the Chamber. These were rejected, but it wi 
finally agreed that primary technical training should be annexed t 
the existing primary schools. Hence, the law of December 11, 1880 
which provided for schools of manual apprenticeship (écoles man: 
uelles d’apprentissage) to be assimilated, as regarded support an 
regulations, to the higher-primary schools having a distinctly techni 
cal character (écoles primaires supérieures professionnelles). 
The same year, 1880, the legislature authorized the creation o 
another order of schools, the écoles nationales professionnelle 
which were intended to illustrate the kind of primary education tha 
might replace in society the decaying apprenticeship system by a: 
effort beginning with the infant class and following the child to th 
adolescent period. As explained by M. Buisson, the general directo 
of primary instruction, these schools are— 
not, in any sense, special technical schools, more or less complete schools of engineeri 
(écoles d’arts et métiers); they are associations of schools comprising an infant and 
primary elementary school, and at each stage technical instruction which, commen 
ing from the earliest age, when it is of littfe importance, continues up to the very ei 
of the course, when it becomes of the first moment. When he has arrived at this fin: 
stage the apprentice, who now only needs the practice of his trade to become a wor! 
man, leaves the national school and goes either into a workshop or into a techni 
school, in the proper sense of the term. 
It was believed that such schools would “lead a youth to t 
threshold of the factory or the engineering school, armed not alo: 
with general and with special knowledge, but with the aptitudes ai 
habits of work which would enable him after a few months of practi 
in a particular calling to become a finished workman.” 
Three schools of the character indicated were established in 18 
and 1887. They were supported by the State and with a four 
school subsequently opened have been the objects of really lavi 
expenditure. On the other hand, the technical high schools, whi 
have been gradually converted into practical schools of commer 
and industry, are municipal or communal schools, aided by t! 
State and varying in equipment and in resources according to lo 
conditions. 
It may be said, then, that the third period in the development 
technical instruction in France, the period of the Republic, has 
marked by the controlling influence of municipalities and the Natio 
Government. Private enterprise and corporate action have 
ceased, the associations that rose in the second period are in

   ctivity to-day, chambers of commerce and trade syndicates main- 
ain technical schools and endow technical scholarships, but it is 
cognized that only national and city authorities can adequately 
rovide for the industrial training of the masses. 
THE CONGRESS OF 1889. 
The great change that took place in the industrial and agricul- 
ural world in the decade ending 1889 was focused in the Universal 
xposition held at Paris that year, and the significance of this change 
r education was the principal theme of the congress on technical 
ducation, perhaps the most notable of the series of congresses aux- 
iary to the exposition. 
According to the decisions of this congress, technical instruction in 
s broadest sense has for its object the study of the arts and sciences, 
view of their application to a definite trade or profession. The 
aining must be as varied as the trades and professions, its degrees 
ing determined in each case by the end in view. To avoid confu- 
on it was decided that hereafter in international usage, the term 
technical instruction,’ without a modifying word, shall be held to 
clude both industrial and commercial training. 
As regards the grade or stages of instruction in France, the con- 
‘ess defined primary technical instruction as that which is given in 
hools of apprenticeship and in the higher primary schools (i. e., 
hools for pupils above 12 years of age); secondary technical as the 
truction given in the schools of arts and trades; superior tech- 
ical, the instruction given in the Central School of Arts and Manu- 
ictures and in institutions of the same high order. This classification 
ed in the main with the conditions under which technical instruc- 
nm was carried on in France at the time. 
ICAL SCHOOLS BELONGING TO THE CLASS OF PRIMARY TECHNICAL 
INSTRUCTION. 
‘he municipal and national schools already referred to fall into the 
t class recognized by the Congress of 1889, i. e., that of primary 
hnical instruction, and although they arose from conditions of 
and of industry peculiar to France, nevertheless, as regards 
pose and methods, they are types of what vocational schools must 
or at least incline to be, everywhere. Hence, detailed accounts 
a few of these schools offer valuable suggestions to ourselves at 
present time. Naturally, as Paris led in the provision for pri- 
ry technical instruction at public expense, the schools of this city 
e formed models for the rest of France and are of chief interest 
the foreign investigator. At the same time, it must be remem- 
d that the Paris technical schools, of which there are now

fifteen (seven for boys and eight for girls), present a wealth of equip: 
ment, a perfection in detail, and a standard of achievement attainabl 
only in a great center of manufactures and trade, and, it may b 
added, of luxurious tastes and requirements. Further, it should b 
said that while, nominally, the Paris schools are included in th 
state system of public instruction they are, in fact, under the super. 
vision and control of the municipality, which jealously guards it: 
independence. The schools are practically supported by the city 
and so far from being subject to ministerial regulations furnish th 
model for national procedure. In Paris a child enters the infan 
school at about 3 years of age and the primary school at 6. He: 
begins a regular course of manual training which, in the case of boy: 
is generally conducted in a school workshop, and, in the case of girl 
comprises sewing and the cutting of garments, millinery, and othe} 
feminine industries. As soon as the certificate of primary studies j 
gained, or at about 12 years of age, the pupil is eligible for admissio 
to either a higher primary school or an école professionnelle. 
The Ecole Diderot.—¥or admission to the Ecole Diderot, a bo} 
must be at least 13 years of age and not more than17. The followi 
account of this school is taken from the report of a commission 
experts,* who recently made an extended investigation of schools 
its class in Europe: 
The Diderot School, the first “professional”? school created in Paris, had for 
expressed object “the making of well-instructed and skillful workmen, capable 
earning their living on leaving the school.” 
The instruction is both theoretical and practical. The pupils enter school at 7. 
a. m., and leave it at 6 p. m.; but there are two breaks, viz, 12-1.15 and 3.15-3. 
The school year commences on September | and ends July 31, the month of Au; 
being a vacation month. 
The school claims to be, above all, a school of apprenticeship, the general instructi| 
occupying only a secondary place. In fact, general instruction is reduced to t| 
lowest limit in order to allow the pupils to spend as much time as possible in 
workshop. 
The course is of three years’ duration. The programme, which may be divided i 
two parts, viz, theoretical and practical, is as follows: 
Ecole Diderot.—Programme of theoretical instruction. 
Year, and hours per week. 
Arithmetic and algebra. 
Geometry 
‘Theoretical 
Physics... Hygiene and economics.

   The programme of practical or manual instruction includes forge work, turning 
(metal), fitting, etc., fine mechanical work, pattern making, carpentry and joinery, 
locksmithing, brazier’s work, and plumbing. During the first year five and a half 
hours are devoted daily to these; during the second year, six hours; and during the 
third, seven and a half hours. 
The organization of the practical work is very good. The pupils on arrival are 
distributed among the nine workshops, where manual instruction is given. In each 
section a first-year pupil is placed, as soon as possible, between a second and third 
year pupil. 
In the forges, first-year pupils are strikers, etc., make up the fire, and in this way 
become familiar with their later duties. 
As far as possible the work done is utilized. The work, in detail, consists of parts 
lof complete machines to be later fitted up. 
‘A large part of the tools and machine tools in the establishment is the work of the 
upils. As there is no foundry in the school, the patterns made by the pupils are sent 
outside for the necessary castings, but the main part of the work is done in the school. 
The work in the section of mechanics of precision comprises the making of geodetic 
nd physical instruments. In these the last degree of care is necessarily taken as to 
xactness. Each student studies the tools he uses, first from a purely kinematic point 
f view, and then under supervision uses it for making a special piece of apparatus. 
n this way he better appreciates the conditions by means of which exactness is 
ttainable. 
The motive power is derived from two engines, a steam and a gas engine, each of 
bout 15 horsepower. A second and a third year pupil are required to attend to the 
team engine under supervision continuously for a week. 
Twice a year the pupils of each section of the school execute the same piece of work, 
. ¢., there is one piece of work for each section. This is done from drawings or sketches 
nd without explanation, and marks are given, and also money prizes, according to 
ihe quality of the work so determined. Besides this, marks are given for theoretical 
ind practical work, conduct in class and workshop, and each pupil receives a monthly 
ward in money based thereupon. 
At the distribution of prizes at the end of July each year, each pupil who has 
cquitted himself well, in respect of his theoretical and technical studies, receives an 
denture of apprenticeship (un brévet d’ apprentissage), and further a sum of money, 
ind such tools as will enable him to carry out his work. 
Several times a year pupils of each section visit suitable industrial establishments, 
der the guidance of the appropriate instructors, who give such detailed explanations 
seem to him necessary. Each pupil makes a report, illustrated by sketches. 
The Ecole Estienne, an institution of even wider fame than the 
cole Diderot, is an école du livre, and bears the name of a celebrated 
mily of printers and publishers, whose first publications go back as 
r as the commencement of the sixteenth century. In 1881 the 
unicipal council of Paris undertook ‘‘to create a school the object 
which was to educate artistic workmen, qualified not only to carry 
t the work of ordinary typographers, but also that of allied arts.” 
Ihe school was opened in 1889, and in 1895 special buildings were 
ected, covering about 3,256 square meters on a plot of about 5,600 
uare meters. The cost of the buildings was $283,191 (1,415,959 
anes). The annual budget, in round numbers, is 255,000 francs

   The following particulars are set forth in the official regulations for 
the school: i 
The course lasts four years, and in certain cases may be extended to five years; 
from 75 to 90 pupils are admitted yearly. 
Admission is by examination, the age for which is between 13 and 16; the pupil 
must be French and domiciled in Paris or its environs. 
Pupils resident in Paris are admitted free. The suburban communes must pay 200 
francs ($40) per annum for each pupil resident in the suburbs. 
Breakfast is furnished gratuitously to pupils resident in Paris; those from the suburbs 
must bring their breakfast or pay at a rate fixed by regulation. 
Instruction in the Ecole Estienne.—The theoretical instruction has for its object the 
completion of the general instruction of the “apprentices,”’ including “those indis- 
pensable ideas which should be possessed by every workman who desires to excel in 
his craft.’” 
The principal subjects of the theoretical course are: (i) French language; (ii) history 
and geography; (iii) the reading of Greek for typographers; (iv) the conceptions of 
mathematics and geometry; (v) the physical and natural sciences as applied to the 
arts and to the publishing industry; (vi) the history of art; (vii) the history of printing 
and publishing; (viii) modeling; (ix) the drawing of ornaments, etc.; (x) drawing at 
sight and industrial drawing; (xi) gymnastic and military exercises. 
The theoretical instruction is given every morning from 8.30 till 12, and is general 
for all pupils of the first and second years. In the third and fourth years it is divided 
into three orders of special courses, viz, (1) for engravers, lithographers, gilders; (2) for 
compositors, photographers, photogravurists, etc. ; (3) for typographic founders, copper- 
plate workers, etc. The courses are specially adapted to the practical requirements 
of each. 
Pupils of the third and fourth years take theoretical courses for four mornings a 
week; the whole of Friday and Saturday is passed in the workshop. 
The technical courses occupy from 1 to 6 in the afternoon, Monday to Saturday, 
inclusive, for all pupils. They embrace fifteen different callings, viz: 
Typography.—Type founding, composing, and adjusting; printing’ with hand an 
machine presses, photography and galvanoplastic work. 
Bookbinding.—Bookbinding, gilding on leather. (Three special teachers also com: 
once a week to give instruction in gilt-edging, marbling, chasing upon leather, etc. 
Engraving.—Engraving upon wood, engraving in relief, copper-plate engraving, 
printing. 
Lithography.—Lithographic engraving, chromolithography, lithographic drawing, 
lithographic writing, printing with hand and machine presses. 
Photography.—Photography and such derivative processes as photogravure, photo: 
typing, etc. (This part of the instruction does not aim at being completed in th 
school.) 
Examinations and discipline, Ecole Estienne.—In each branch of the school there i 
an examination at the end of each four months (trimestre; really about three and one} 
half months), when the pupils are arranged in order of merit. . Those who do no 
obtain sufficient marks either repeat the work already gone through or are dismisses 
from the school, at the discretion of a superintending council (conseil de surveillance) 
The final diplomas are a diploma of honor, an ordinary diploma or certificate, merel 
stating that the courses of the establishment have been satisfactorily followed durin; 
the four years. 
Each pupil receives a book in which his marks are entered both for studies an 
conduct. It is delivered to him every Saturday evening, and must be returned o: 
the following Monday morning at the school, signed by his parents or guardians. 
Rewards are given in the shape of books, gravures, tools, or money. Pupils who d| 
well are entered at the end of each “trimestre’’ in an honor list, and those who a 
thrice entered on such list receive an “honorable mention”’ at the end of the year.

      From the nature of the specialties of this school, its theoretical 
ourse is much more extended and cultural in character than the 
eneral course of instruction in any other one of the schools of its 
lass. The instruction in the French language is intended to impart 
critical knowledge of the language and its literature, and also to 
amiliarize the pupils with those aspects of the language that are 
equired for expert typographical work. 
The theoretical course includes, besides the French language, his- 
ory and geography, history of books and history of art, mathematics 
nd accounts, physical and natural sciences, especially as applied to 
he book industry, and a very extended course in drawing, modeling, 
esigning, decorative composition, and industrial designs. 
The thoroughness of the technical instruction may be illustrated by 
he following account of the lithographic course, cited from the report 
f the commission of New South Wales already referred to: 
Lithographic drawing, Ecole Estienne.—The instruction in this subject comprises 
ree sections of work, viz, work with ink, with the pencil, chromo-photo-lithography. 
‘he course is four years. The fundamental work is that in ink, and this extends 
roughout the course. The work with the pencil is taught, but the profound modifica- 
on introduced by photography is necessarily recognized. Nevertheless, instruction 
ith the pencil is indispensable to the lithographer, and is of great use in the chromo- 
ph. By its use, even with one color and with one printing, quite a range of nuances 
e possible. The instructor is careful to seize every opportunity of developing the 
thetic judgment of the pupil, and he endeavors to make the courses in the school 
act against any treatment of industrial art as if it were inferior to art in the more 
stract sense of the term. 
First year.—Mode of cutting lithographic pencils, of converting steel bands into 
ms. Study of the calque. Various methods of transfer to stone. Execution on 
one of simple models for the purpose of initiating the pupil into the use of the litho- 
phic pen and the grease pencil. Necessity for habits of order and cleanliness to 
cure good results.. Handling the stones. Mode of safeguarding against accident. 
xercises with lithographic pen and pencil. Geometrical exercises involving use of 
mpass and ruler. These studies are made progressively difficult. Copy of engrav- 
3, etc. 
Sid year.—Exercises in imitative drawing suitable for lithographic execution. 
ork with the lithographic pen. Landscapes, ornaments, figures, exercises on the 
me from models so graduated as to compel the pupil to surmount successive diffi- 
ties in execution, and with the pen increasing the difficulty. Shadows by hachures, 
ercises in drawing from nature, introducing practical deductions as to the phenomena 
perspective and light effects. Copies of simple engravings, exercises in pointillé 
mre Jehenne), exercises with lithographic pencil as applicable to chromolithog- 
hy. First attempt at color combination. Interpretation of sketches, photographs, 
paintings, water-color paintings, work in distemper, pastels, etc., by work with the 
lhographic pen (pointillé and etching), by shade, and the lithographic pencil. 
Third year.—Execution on the stone of subjects presenting difficulties of modeling or 
ect. Continuation of exercises of preceding year. Artisticanatomy. Ornamental 
position. General laws governing motifs and subjects, treated from the decorative 
int of view. The applications of geometry to drawing, descriptive geometry, pro- 
tion, perspective, etc. The object of this work is to enable pupils to draw to any 
ired scale industrial objects which one may wish, for example, to figure in an album 
mn industrial catalogue. Study of combinations of color. Autography, geometry, 
 
-P-A-G-E-412

machines, figures, and ornaments. Exercises on the use of the eraser and on the use 
of varnish on the stone. Shading in order to heighten the light effect. Drawing of 
industrial objects from nature, plan, elevation, section, perspective. These drawings 
are transferred to the stone or to the zinc and are lithographed by means of etching, 
pointillé, the pencil, etc. Chromolithography, study of the combination of colors. 
Copies of the fine engravings of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. General 
interpretation by means of the lithographic pen of photographs, paintings, drawings, 
etc. 
Fourth year.—The work of the preceding years is advanced in the fourth year, and| 
the independent studies are united so as to call into exercise the range of manipulative] 
skill already acquired. Zincography: Various features of zincography, work upoi 
grained and pumiced zinc. General recommendations as to work on zinc. Chromo 
lithography, chromotypography. The execution of pictures and subjects by eacl 
process. Ornate letters for commercial work. Type of work suitable for industri: 
albums, catalogues, etc. Views of industrial establishments in black and in color. 
The above work is done in each different style, and an endeavor is made to secure that 
boldness and thoroughness of treatment without which a good and free impressio: 
can not be obtained. Study of the combination of colors. Analysis of pictures i: 
pastels, water colors, oils, distemper, camaieu, sepia, ceramics, etc. Drawing fro 
nature of industrial objects and interpretation on stone by various methods. Genera! 
recapitulation. 
Stone engraving, Ecole Estienne —The object of the teaching of this subject is to facil] 
itate the production of drawings, illustrations, etc., for commerce, science, etc. (fo)

Lithographic writing, Ecole Estienne.—The end of this course is a technical study 
lithographic work on the stone and with the pen, of writing in vignettes and th 
various applications, commercial, industrial, and artistic. The technique of the p| 
demands of the pupil a considerable amount of skill in drawing; of its importa 
nothing need be said.

includes printing with hand and machine presses. The latter com- 
prises a course in wood engraving, in relief engraving, copper engray- 
ing, and copperplate printing. 
REMAINING SCHOOLS OF THE PARIS GROUP. 
The five remaining technical schools for boys in Paris, belonging to 
the primary class are as follows: The Ecole de physique et de chimie, 
the character of which is indicated by its title; the Ecole Bernard- 
Palissy, virtually a school of fine arts applied to industry; Germain- 
Pilon, a school of practical drawing; the Ecole Boulle, as distin- 
guished for furniture and cabinetmaking as Diderot is for ironwork; 
and the Ecole Dorian, a municipal orphanage, which gives extended 
training in iron and wood work. 
The courses in these schools, as in the two schools described more 
fully, cover three or four years. 
The eight municipal technical schools for girls in Paris are, in the 
main, devoted to what are commonly recognized as trades for women, 
such as tailoring, millinery, flower making, fine lingerie, etc. The 
courses are necessarily much less varied than is the case in respect to 
the schools for boys, and also less stimulating to the mind. The most 
interesting schools of the class are those due to the initiative of Mme. 
Elisa Lemonnier, whose name they bear. In 1856 this philanthropic 
woman founded a société de protection maternelle pour les jeunes 
filles, transformed in 1862 into the société pour l’enseignement pro- 
fessionnel des femmes, which opened in the same year the first technical 
school for women in France. Three years later Mme. Lemonnier 
died, but the work was carried on in her spirit and the society soon 
had in charge four schools to which girls over 12 were admitted after 
examination. In 1907 the schools were taken over by the munici- 
pality of Paris, which has continued their work upon the lines origi- 
nally marked out but with regard to the later developments of the 
industries to which the training is directed. These are all industries 
in which decorative drawing and design form an essential factor; on 
 
-P-A-G-E-414
  
  406 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
this art side, and in the manipulation of the material which enters 
into the final product, such as tapestries, lace, ivory, precious metals, 
leather, copper, ceramics, etc., the training is elaborate and thorough. 
THE NATIONAL TECHNICAL SCHOOLS. 
Attention has already been drawn to the fact that the four national 
schools included in the class of primary technical instruction were 
intended to illustrate a new theory of education for the industrial 
classes, and, in time, to revolutionize the existing system of primary 
education. These hopes have not been realized, and the schools are 
differentiated from those already described, simply by the fact that 
they are state supported and comprise a group of schools, namely, 
infant school, primary school, and specialized technical school under 
one direction. 
Candidates for admission to the industrial section of one of these 
national schools must have secured the certificate of primary studies. 
The programme of this section, like that of the écoles pratiques 
dindustrie, comprises general and technical instruction but less time 
is given to workshop practice, viz: The first year, 14 hours a week; 
the second, 174 hours; the third, 244 hours. The programme for 
the first year is the same for all schools of this class, but in the second 
year specialization begins, the work thenceforth bearing immediate 
relation to the special trades of the respective districts in which the 
schools are situated. At Vierzon, it is related to ironwork and 
painting on pottery; at Voiron, to working in paper, linen, and silk; 
at Armentiéres, to ironwork and weaving. 
THE PRACTICAL SCHOOLS OF INDUSTRY. 
The practical schools of industry, as already explained, are schools 
maintained by the united efforts of the government and the com- 
munes in which the schools are situated, and are under the official 
direction of, and receive government aid through, the department of 
commerce and industry. 
The official time-table of the schools for boys is arranged as follows:

To the above must be added time spent in study, amounting to 
nine hours per week in each year. 
The character of the practical courses may be inferred from details 
pertaining to a single school. In the Ecole pratique d’industrie de 
Lille, for boys, there are 5 forges, 6 anvils, 2 vises, the area of the 
shop being 132 square meters (about 1,420 square feet). The car- 
penter shop, of the same area, has 21 benches, 4 wood lathes, and 1 
band saw. These equipments pertain to the course in physics and 
its industrial application. Each of the remaining practical courses, 
namely, photography, weaving, and practical mechanics, has equally 
complete equipment. 
The programme of the corresponding schools for girls gives larger 
time to general instruction through the addition of ethics and ordi- 
nary sewing and cutting out of garments, and the strictly industrial 
instruction is somewhat reduced in amount. The latter is arranged 
as follows:

To the above must be added a further six hours a week for prepa- 
ation of studies. 
In the commercial section, or the separate commercial school, as 
he case may be, the time assigned to workshop practice in the above 
rogramme is devoted to business specialties. 
According to the latest official statistics, covering the year 1907, 
he four écoles nationales professionnelles had an enrollment of 1,473 
upils, an increase of 358 since 1900; the number of the practical 
chools of commerce and industry had increased in the same time

11,503. The budget for 1910 carried an appropriation of 586,185 
Gennes ($117,237) for the former schools and of 1,793,930 francs 
($358,786) for the latter. 
PRESENT TENDENCY. 
The examples that have been given may suffice to illustrate the 
character of primary technical training in France; it is distinctly 
vocational, it is carried out with marvelous system and thoroughness, 
and everywhere it tends to extreme specialization. The endeavor 
has been made at times to engraft the training upon the general 
system of primary education, an endeavor which would appear to be 
comparatively easy in France where primary education is Pestalozzian 
in spirit and method, and the higher primary schools all give more or 
less technical instruction. At other times the endeavor has been 
made to emphasize general instruction in the schools of the technical 
type. This was notably the case in the Ecole de la Martiniére, the 
most famous of the primary technical schools of Lyon. The school 
was established in 1830 by private initiative and is managed under a 
trust deed, the trustees acting conjointly with the minister of com- 
merce. The purpose of the school was ‘‘to give a sound, practical 
training to those who are to enter industrial or commercial life at a 
comparatively early age.” For more than a half century it was 
educative in the general sense, preparing boys for industrial life but not 
training them for the exercise of any particular calling. This policy 
was modified in 1895 by providing for technical specialties in the 
third year of the course. By this action, says an English authority, 
“the most important stronghold of a system of generalization in| 
French primary technical instruction may be said to have fallen.” 
Specialization was definitely adopted as the government policy by 
the law of 1892 which placed the practical schools of commerce an 
industry under the sole charge of the minister of commerce an 
industry, thus removing them entirely from the system of genera 
primary instruction. At that time a department of technical instruc 
tion was created in the ministry named, and appropriations coverin, 
salaries and many other expenses were offered through this ministr 
for schools giving instruction in commerce and industry to pupil 
from the elementary schools. Subsequently the écoles nationale: 
professionnelles were transferred to the same ministry. 
The growth in this independent direction is illustrated by a recen 
enterprise, of which Mr. John C. Covert, United States consul at Lyon| 
reports as follows: 
During some years past a project has been under consideration to establish a nation: 
weaving and embroidery school in Lyon, and the minister of commerce, Mr. Crupp' 
has recently taken up the subject and proposes that the National Government at Pai

     shall act with the municipality of Lyon in the premises. It is proposed that the latter 
contribute $193,000 to the enterprise. The minister of commerce has set forth in a 
recent statement his plan of organization and conduct of the school as follows: 
“Tt will be necessary at first to provide for the apprenticeship of young men who 
wish to engage in the manufacture as a life business. This would include a course 
of apprenticeship for hand and steam looms for warpers, designers, setters on card, 
readers, piqueurs, and monteurs. 
“There should be a complete and progressive apprenticeship, including such a 
technical knowledge as will enable the workman to carry on his trade intelligently. 
Parallel with this, an analogous organization should furnish the same instruction to 
the departments of dyeing, preparing, printing, embroidery, and the machinery used 
in weaving. 
“‘\ higher department, which might be called the superior section of technical 
instruction, should receive future manufacturers, mill owners, overseers, samplers, 
young men from 17 to 20 years of age, already possessing solid elementary instruction 
and a fund of technical information which would permit them to assimilate rapidly 
the knowledge of the art of manufacture in all its branches and to make new designs. 
This organization should be supplemented by courses of lectures intended to promote 
elementary improvement and to increase the fund of information of the workingmen 
and apprentices who were unable to attend the school before going to work in the 
factory. The school would thus popularize all knowledge useful to manufacturers 
or workmen in the silk industries. Boarding and day pupils will be received in the 
school.” 
In respect to the present policy it may be said that the principle 
of intensive specialization is generally approved by French author- 
ities; but as regards the age at which specialization should be encour- 
aged, and the policy of separate and often antagonistic administra- 
‘ions of the two types of primary education, general and special, there 
s a conflict of opinion. This conflict increases as the need of pro- 
essionally trained teachers for the primary technical schools becomes 
ore and more evident. Temporary provision has been made for 
eeting this necessity by the institution of normal sections in several 
f the higher technical schools; but this action threatens to introduce 
ocial distinctions among the laboring classes of France at the very 
ime when the effort is being made to break down the long-standing 
istinctions between the lower and the upper classes of society. On 
hese two phases of the general problem of primary technical educa- 
ion, namely, that of early specialization and.dual administration of 
he two types of primary education, the last word has not been spoken 
France. 
The purpose of the foregoing review of technical instruction in 
'rance has been to show, in particular, the character of the schools 
nd the instruction characterized as primary, the ever-increasing 
ovement from the less practical to the more practical types of 
hools, and the relation of the primary technical school to the system 
is a whole. The last consideration requires -brief reference to the 
igher orders of technical institutions. :

SECONDARY TECHNICAL SCHOOLS. 
The congress of 1889 comprised schools of arts and trades under 
the head of secondary technical instruction. At this point the classi- 
fication is confusing unless it be remembered that the committee had 
in mind a particular group of institutions, the écoles nationales d’arts 
et métiers. These schools, as their title indicates, were established 
by the Government with a clearly defined purpose and a carefully 
planned organization. 
The great body of art and trade schools in the country, belonging 
to the secondary class, were established by corporate bodies, i. e., 
chambers of commerce and trade syndicates, by associations such as 
the Philotechnic, or by private individuals. They are distinguished 
from the schools of the primary class by many features of which the 
most important are: (1) Their narrow specialization; (2) the maturer 
age of their pupils, who are, as a rule, persons already working at their 
trades; (3) the general absence of entrance requirements; (4) their 
origin and sources of support. The names of individual trade schools 
are a sufficient index of their character. Examples are: The tech- 
nical schools for masons, established by the Paris societies of mason: 
and stonecutters; courses for tailors maintained by the incorporated| 
body of tailors; schools for jewelry manufacture maintained by th 
jewelers’ syndicate. The purpose of all such schools and courses i 
to perfect workmen in their craft. The instruction is almost alway: 
free; indeed, gratuity is the impressive feature of this enormous effor' 
on the part of manufacturers, employers of labor, chambers of com: 
merce, and trade unions, to maintain the standard of French industrial 
art and its commercial prestige. 
The national schools of arts and trades are highly specialize 
technical schools with elaborate equipment for workshop practice 
Situated respectively at Aix, Angers, Chalons-sur-Marne, Lille, an 
Cluny, each one is easy of access to all the departments of a grea 
geographical section. A law of 1906 authorized the establishment o 
a sixth school of the class, at Paris, which will be opened the prese: 
year. 
The conditions for admission to these schools are substantially a 
follows: 
1. French citizenship. 
2. To be above the age of 15 and below 17 at the time of the co: 
petitive examination for admission, which takes place on the 1st da 
of October in each year. 
Two examinations are required. One before a jury sitting in t 
principal town of the Department, and the other before a governme 
commission appointed by the minister of commerce. The admissio 
requirements comprise written composition and oral examinatio!

   orthography, arithmetic, the elements of geometry, lineal and 
mmamental drawing, and the four elementary operations of algebra. 
Each of the schools admits about 300 pupils, and as the course of 
struction covers three years, 100 new students are accepted annually. 
ost of the pupils are from the public schools, and belong to the 
orking classes or are the sons of small shopkeepers and government 
fficials. They are all “internes” (boarders). The annual contribu- 
on of the pupil is 600 francs, for which he obtains full education, 
oard, and lodging; an additional sum of 300 francs is required for 
e full three years’ course outfit. In general, however, at least 
ee-fourths of the pupils are in receipt of government scholarships, 
hich cover the cost of tuition and living. Hence, practically, the 
hools are gratuitous. The government appropriation for their 
rrent expenditures amounted in 1910 to 1,873,483 francs ($374,696). 
his sum was 23 per cent of the total appropriation for technical and 
mmercial education. 
The purpose and achievements of the écoles nationales d’arts et 
étiers were characterized by President Faure in an address before 
aduates as follows:% 
'Though originally only designed to provide the great army of industry with ser- 
ants—i. e., with managers and foremen of works—the results have so far surpassed 
pectation that in many instances the sergeant has become the commissioned officer 
d the manager has developed into the engineer. The system which assigns to each 
these institutions a certain number of departments as its special domain gives 
m an all-embracing, as well as uniform, influence. As the principal training 
unds of mechanical skill, more especially in metallurgy, they are, undoubtedly, 
first-rate importance to the country. They possess the initial advantage of a high 
ndard of admission, permanently secured by a difficult competitive examination. 
e students are thus from the outset picked candidates, and not only have they an 
‘ance examination to pass, but the teachers of theory, the engineers, the managers 
workshops, are themselves selected by a competition of which the conditions are 
ermined by the ministry of commerce. The director of the school holds his 
ointment directly from the same minister. Only those students who pass through 
entire course of three years receive a diploma, which is subject to an examination, 
which confers the title of ““Eléve breveté des écoles nationales d’arts et métiers. ” 
student who is without this diploma has any title to call himself a pupil of the 
ool. A special diploma is reserved for those who pass the final examination with 
inction. The schools themselves are under the jurisdiction of the minister of 
merce, and under the immediate supervision of the prefect of the Department 
hich they are situated. For the three hundred places, in round numbers, which 
ry offer for competition each year there are no less than between 1,200 and 1,300 
didates. They have all the prestige of government institutions, by which a French 
tent lays so much store. An even more potent source of attraction is the prospect 
ich they hold out to all fairly industrious and well-conducted students of escaping 
years of military service. Such dispensation is granted by law to four-fifths of 
e number of students who at the leaving examination succeed in obtaining 65 
cent of the possible total of marks.

       HIGHER TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 
The highest grade of scientific and technical instruction in France 
is given in special schools, such as the Conservatoire National d 
Arts et Métiers, the Ecole Polytechnique, etc. These schools ar 
intended to prepare men for the technical service of the state, or t 
become directors of great enterprises which require both scientific an 
technical knowledge. 
The higher technical schools are under different ministries, namel 
the ministry of commerce, of agriculture, of war, etc., according t 
their specialties. 
The principal schools of this high order under the ministry 
commerce and industry are the following, all situated at Paris:

cole Supérieure de Navigation Maritime. 
Other technical schools, as the Polytechnique, the Institut Agr 
nomique, etc., are mies the ministries to which their specialti 
pertain. 
A significant fact in the recent history of higher education 
France is the multiplication of chairs for scientific branches in t! 
university faculties, and the equipment of laboratories and institu 
for the promotion of scientific research and experimentation. As 
result of this activity, provision for the highest order of techni 
training, which was formerly confined to the special schools located 
Paris, is now made, to some extent at least, in all the universi| 
centers of the country. For example, at the University of Marsei 
there is a chair of industrial physics and another of industrial che 
istry, and similar chairs at both the University of Bordeaux and t 
of Nancy. At the University of Lille there is a chair of appli 
chemistry, and both here and at Lyon chairs in chemistry applied | 
industry and to agriculture. Through this extension of universj 
activities, extreme specialization in the province of higher techni 
education in France is giving place to the principle of coordinati 
and philosophic unity.

EDUCATION IN FRANCE, 
PART II. SYSTEM OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. 
  
SECONDARY AND HIGHER EDUCATION. 
CURRENT TENDENCIES. 
  The system of schools and higher institutions in France under the 
minister of public instruction, although organized in three depart- 
ments for administrative purposes, presents in reality two great 
divisions, one comprising the secondary schools and universities, the 
other the primary schools. These two divisions are distinct in their 
origin and scholastic character; but there has lately been a gradual 
approach of the primary system to the secondary schools through 
the assimilation of the higher primary schools to the local colleges. 
he local, or communal, colleges belong to the department of second- 
lary education, but while the lycées, the typical secondary schools of 
rance, are established and maintained by the State the colleges are 
tablished by local authorities, the State contributing to their 
aintenance. Although the colleges follow the same official pro- 
ammes as the lycées, few of them offer the full secondary course of 
mstruction, so that they have formed a sort of inferior order of sec- 
ndary schools, or a preparatory stage to the upper section of the 
yeées. The boarding departments of the colleges are often under 
rivate management, and sometimes this is the case with the entire 
stablishment. The proviseur or director is then not only burdened 
ith the household expenses, but is responsible for the progress of the 
tudents, although he has nothing to do with choosing the faculty, as 
Il the professors are appointed by the minister of public instruction. 
ard pressed by the rival clerical schools, and by the higher primary 
chools, as the latter have expanded, many of the colleges have 
ragged on a very uncertain and feeble existence. Others, having 
ore liberal support from local authorities, have become important 
egional schools, drawing patronage from a large radius. The new pro- 
rammes of secondary education (decree of 1902) which accord equal 
ecognition to different courses of studies, i. e., the classical, the Latin 
cientific, and the modern, have been specially advantageous to the 
colleges which are thus free to adjust themselves somewhat to local 
ireumstance. The modern courses of instruction are coordinated to 
hose of the higher primary schools, and hence it is possible for pupils 
lo pass from the latter into the colleges. This movement is fostered 
Yy government bourses open to competitive examination, and 
tended to enable promising youths, whose parents can not afford 
e expense of a college education, to meet the tuition fees and cost of 
ving. The secondary schools, it must be remembered, are not free 
hools, and this fact has determined their social distinction. The

414 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
gradual approach of the primary and secondary systems is therefore 
significant for social as well as for educational reasons. 
The secondary schools comprise the whole scheme of liberal educa- 
tion which, in that sense, is complete in itself; it is also the prepara- 
tory stage to the specialized university faculties and the higher 
special schools, such as the Polytechnic, the Conservatoire National] 
des Artes et Métiers, etc. These relations between secondary and| 
higher education have existed for many centuries, the secondary, 
schools being merely a modernized form of the colleges which grew up| 
around the University of Paris, and the provincial universities of th 
medieval period. Under the old régime there was no hard and fas 
line between college and university instruction, and hence recen’ 
efforts for extending the scope and increasing the student body of th 
faculties of science and literature are virtually a return to the forme 
conception of liberal education as a university function. Under th 
system of specialization which Napoleon adopted for the highe 
education, the faculties of literature and science were little more th: 
examining juries, and under the Republic, up to a very recent date 
they simply added to this function that of preparing candidates for th 
agrégation or examination for professorships in the lycées. Althoug! 
no marked change has taken place in this respect, the increase in th 
number of matriculates in the two faculties named shows that the 
are gradually attracting students who have other careers in view 
The faculties of science, with their recent equipment of laboratories 
and technical institutes, are drawing to themselves young men destine 
to become directors of great industrial enterprises; in like manner| 
the faculties of letters are becoming the resort of students intereste 
in the economic and social reorganizations of the time, and also o 
both young men and young women who are preparing for positions 
school inspectors and professors of normal schools. This extension i 
stimulated by recent measures which provide for the admission o| 
students who have not obtained the bachelor’s degree to certaii 
courses in the faculties here considered. 
It appears from this cursory review of current movements that th 
rigid lines of demarkation, social and seholastic, that have broken u 
the unity of educational processes in France are relaxing, and wh 
may be termed a democratizing influence is gradually permeating th| 
whole system. f

In the absence of a recent report from the minister of publicinstru 
tion on the department of secondary education, the latest partic 
lars pertaining to the institutions comprised under that head a

Secondary schools for boys—From the following table it appears 
at the enrollment in the public secondary schools has increased 
about 8,000 since 1901, the grand total of secondary students is 
nsiderably less than at the earlier date, the difference being very 
arly 26,000. In a measure this decline is doubtless due to the 
creased attendance upon higher primary schools and upon the 
actical schools of commerce and industry. It is also to be pre- 
med that the reports from the private secondary schools are incom- 
ete.

In his report as chairman of the committee of the Chamber of 
puties on the budget of public instruction for 1910, M. Steeg calls, 
ention to two significant tendencies in the secondary schools for 
ys: First, the decline in the number of boarders (internes); in the 
ées there were 25,279 boarders in 1885; in 1908 there were a little 
ls than 17,000. In the same period the number of boarders in the 
eges fell from 15,277 to 12,854. On the other hand, the number 
boarders in private secondary schools and in private boarding 
ses that accommodate students is increasing. M. Steeg notes 
lo the continued decline in the number of students taking Greek 
the increase in the number and quality of the students attracted 
the section of Latin and science. 
n the five years from 1906 to 1910, inclusive, the total increase in 
appropriation for secondary schools for boys has been 2,785,550 
cs ($557,110), which has been used chiefly to meet the increase 
the salaries of professors and assistants. The total appropriation 
the Government for the maintenance of secondary schools for 
s amounted in 1909 to about 20,789,502 francs ($4,157,900). 
ublic secondary schools for girls—Public secondary schools for 
s bear the same names as those for boys, but they are adminis- 
d separately and are under different regulations as regards pro- 
Immes and standards. The number of these institutions still con- 
es to increase, though necessarily not with the almost phenomenal

rapidity of the earlier years of their history. In 1908 the enrollmen 
in 47 lycées for girls was 17,352; in the 61 communal colleges, 10,624 
and in the public secondary classes not yet organized asschools, 6,695 
making a total enrollment of 34,671 girls in public secondary insti 
tutions as against 32,607 in 1906. The total appropriation for th 
current expenditures for these institutions in 1909 was 3,355,57. 
francs ($671,115). This was an increase of 1,360,000 fran 
($272,000) above the amount appropriated for the same purpose i 
1906. Including in one sum the separate: appropriations for secon: 
ary schools for boys and for girls, and additional appropriatio: 
applicable to both or else intended for special purposes, the enti 
amount allowed by the State for this service in 1909 was 29,966,17|

      The state appropriation for the current expenses of the universi- 
jes amounted in 1909 to 14,489,444 francs ($2,897,888). 
The following special schools of university rank are under the min- 
ster of public instruction: Collége de France (appropriation, sta- 
istics for 1909, $115,290); Museum of Natural History (appropria- 
ion, $206,618); Practical School of High Studies (Ecole Pratique 
es Hautes Etudes) (state appropriation, $70,633; city, $7,200); 
chool of Archives (Ecole Nationale des Chartes) (appropriation, 
14,800); School of Oriental Languages (appropriation, $35,060); 
'rench School of Archeology at Rome (appropriation, $14,500); 
ench School at Athens (appropriation, $23,540); Ecole Nationale 
es Beaux-Arts (appropriation, $84,052). 
The Superior Normal School, which has been consolidated with the 
niversity of Paris, received a separate appropriation in 1909, 
mounting to 268,600 francs ($53,720). 
STATE SYSTEM OF PRIMARY INSTRUCTION. 
REVIEW OF THE HALF DECADE, 1901-2 To 1906-7. 
The system of- primary education in France is a subject of special 
terest because of its highly centralized control and its political 
ses. It is essentially a government system, carefully planned as 
means of strengthening the Republic and closely watched lest at 
y point it should fail in this service. The operations and progress 
the system have been systematically recorded by the statistical 
mmission created for that purpose in 1876. A preliminary report 
vering the year 1875 was issued by the commission within a year 
its appointment, and beginning with 1878 a quinquennial report 
s, appeared at regular intervals down to the present time. The 
esident of the commission, M. E. Levasseur, is one of the most 
inent statisticians in Europe, and under his direction the suc- 
ssive volumes have preserved a uniform plan. The eighth quin- 
ennial, covering the period 1901-2 to 1906-7, which has just 
peared, is in the main the basis of the present review, pertaining 
salient particulars of the situation. In order to show progress, 
mparisons are instituted where possible with the corresponding 
ta for the preceding decade.

    as communal schools within the meaning of the law, but the laws o 
the Republic have gone further and required every commune t 
establish public schools. For a time, however, schools under privat 
control were also recognized by the present Government. Th 
effort to bring the entire body of youth under instruction, which i 
a matter of great importance in every country, has been accom 
panied in France by a constant endeavor to substitute public fo: 
clerical schools. 
It appears from the quinquennial report that of the total numbe 
of communes in France in 1907, namely, 36,584, all but 69 ha 
established a public school. Of the latter, 16 had private school 
sanctioned by the authorities; the remaining 53 communes ar 
small and isolated. The law also requires that communes of 50 
inhabitants or more should maintain a separate public school f 
girls. This obligation had been met by 17,268 communes out 
18,061 belonging to the class indicated. There were also 3,65) 
communes having less than 500 inhabitants that had establishe 
a separate public school for girls. 
The number of schools, public and private, at the beginning an| 
end of the half decade under review was as follows:

The obligatory school age in France is 6 to 13 years (law of Mar 
28, 1882), hence the population between those ages serves as 
measure of the required school provision. This item is included 
the census which is taken every five years in France (Table 
As the age analysis of the last census (1906) had not been co: 
pleted at the time of this writing, comparison can not be institut 
between school enrollment (Table 5) and school population, as f 
previous censuses. It may be inferred, however, from the compa: 
son of school enrollment with total population (Table 6), that t 
condition in this respect in 1906 was practically the same as in 19

The number of pupils in infant schools, ‘“écoles maternelles,” 
not included in the foregoing tables, was 651,955 in 1906-7, which 
would raise the total school enrollment to 6,236,980, or 15.6 per cent 
of the entire population. It should be kept in mind, however, that the 
children in infant schools are below the obligatory school age and 
that the establishment of public infant schools is optional with the 
communes. = 
Table 5 not only gives the total enrollment in primary schools, 
but also the classification of pupils by sex and by classes of schools. 
The relative strength of the different classes of schools is made clear 
by Table 7, showing the ratio which the enrollment in each class 
bears to total enrollment.

From the above ratios it is seen that public schools made a decided 
gain in the last half of the decade, while during the same period sec- 
ular schools, public and private, made a much greater gain, and the 
enrollment in schools of the religious orders dropped to a nearly neg-

ligible quantity. The series of tables pertaining to teachers (Tables 
8 to 10) illustrate the same movement. Teachers belonging to reli- 
gious orders have not only been eliminated from the public teaching 
service, but, with the exception of members of a few orders, that 
still have the legal right to exist in France, have been excluded from 
the Republic. - The cause of this change is found in the law of Octo- 
ber 30, 1886, providing for the gradual elimination of members of 
the religious orders from the public teaching service, the more 
recent associations law (1901) and the law of 1904 providing for the 
entire suppression of the teaching orders within a period of ten 
years. These laws have been fully explained ‘in previous reports of 
this series.

  From the above table it appears that there was a decrease of about 
7,000 in the total number of teachers in the primary schools in 1907 
as compared with 1902. This loss was due to the suppression of 
clerical teachers, as will be seen by an examination of Table 9. The 
men teachers belonging to religious orders were entirely excluded 
from public primary schools before 1896-97.

Salaries.—Notwithstanding the fact that the public expenditure 
or primary education has been greatly increased by the complete 
ecularization of the service, the additional funds required to meet 
he increased salaries provided for by laws of March 31 and December 
0, 1903, and to insure the more rapid advancement of the teacher 
‘om lower to higher classes, in accordance with the financial law of 
pril 22, 1905, have been annually forthcoming. In 1908 the Goy- 
mment appropriated for the salaries of teachers in primary schools 
communes of less than 150,000 inhabitants 173,409,000 francs; 
1909, 175,593,514 francs; the proposed appropriation for the same 
urpose for 1910 is 179,596,414 francs. This represents an increase 
three years of 6,187,414 francs, equivalent to $1,237,482.80. 
The salaries allowed by the State for teachers of elementary pri- 
ary schools under, the new regulations are as follows:

rincipals in charge of schools receive additions to the fixed salary of the grade to which they belong, 
follows: If in charge of a school of three or four classes, $40 per annum; if more than four classes, $80. 
‘or promotion from the fifth to the fourth grade and from the fourth to the third the required term of 
ice is five years; from the third to the second, six years, the candidates being advanced in the order 
eniority (laws of March 31 and December 30, 1903). 
addition to the salaries provided by the State, every commune is required by law to provide residence 
ithe head teacher of its public school (in the smaller communes an assistant teacher, if there is one, is 
rally the wife or sister of the principal), or its money equivalent, and a commune may increase the 
‘y. Outside of the large cities, however, the local increase of salaries is seldom granted without the 
‘irement of other teaching.  
-P-A-G-E-430
  422 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
The salaries in the higher primary schools begin with a minimum 
of 2,000 francs ($400) in the fifth class, and rise by successive incre- 
ments of 300 francs to the third class, for which the successiv 
increases are 200 francs each, so that teachers of the highest or firs 
class receive 3,000 francs ($600). 
Professional training.—From the following table it appears that th 
decline in the number of candidates for admission to normal schools 
which excited alarm at the beginning of the last half decade, ha 
been overcome. This change doubtless results in great measure fro 
the improvement in the financial prospects of teachers.

The standard of qualification for the public-teaching service w: 
fully maintained throughout the half decade 1901-2 to 1906-7. I 
the latter year 994 per cent of all the primary teachers had secur 
a professional diploma. Of the men, 63 per cent had the low 
diploma (brevet eléméntaire) and 36.7 per cent ‘the higher diplo 
(brevet supérieur); for the women, the corresponding ratios were 
per cent and 37.2 per cent. 
THE HIGHER PRIMARY NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The two higher normal schools intended to prepare professors f 
the primary normal schools show steady increase in enrollme: 
during the half decade reviewed. The number of students at Fo: 
tenay-aux-Roses, the higher normal school for women, rose from 
in 1902 to 63 in 1907. The latter year there were also 14 perso 
admitted to hear the lessons and lectures’ (auditrices libre). T 
resident staff of the school comprised 32 members as in 1902, ti 
number of external professors, who are charged simply with the c 
duct of class exercises, was reduced from 24 to 22 in the period. 
The higher normal school of St. Cloud for men had 36 students 
1902 and 43 in 1907. Since its establishment in 1882, this instituti| 
has received 426 students, of whom 16 have died and one only 
left the service; the 409 remaining graduates are all filling import: 
positions in the primary normal schools, or the higher primary scho 
or in the inspectorate.

TEACHERS’ FEDERATION VERSUS THE GOVERNMENT. 
The troubles growing out of the endeavors of the Government to 
suppress socialistic tendencies among the teachers, which became 
acute the year following the period covered by the quinquennial 
volume, give promise of satisfactory adjustment. The action of the 
Government was regarded by the teachers as an interference, both 
with their right to form and express political opinions and their right 
to organize in associations for mutual benefit and protection. The 
number of such associations has rapidly increased within recent 
years, and finally a general federation of teachers’ associations was 
formed; naturally, political questions absorbed attention as well as 
those relating to the professional interests and material welfare of the 
members, and strong sympathy was manifested by the leaders of 
this federation with the socialistic movement. While maintaining its 
right to the loyal support of the teachers, the Government has lately 
receded from the extreme position that was assumed some two years 
ago in respect to the federation. The director of the primary system, 
speaking officially, says: 
The administration has recognized the necessity of modifying its course of procedure 
and henceforth will be prepared to deal not with individual teachers alone, but 
with the professional associations, and to explain and to justify to them measures that 
may be adopted. This is a cause of congratulation not alone for the administration 
itself, which will be at once better informed and better understood as regards its own 
intentions, but also for the entire teaching service, which by this course will gain 
force, dignity, and wisdom. For, indeed, only those who are free can be truly wise. 
EFFICIENCY OF THE SCHOOLS. 
The following conditions brought out in the quinquennial report 
have a direct bearing upon the efficiency of the schools: 
Size of classes.—As regards the size of classes in public schools only, 
statistics for 1907 disclose the following facts: The proportion of 
classes having 50 pupils or fewer was 95.6 per cent; from 51 to 60 
pupils, 4 per cent; 61 to 70 pupils, 0.4 per cent; 71 to 80 pupils, the 
small proportion of 0.1 per cent; more than 80 pupils, 0.05 per cent. 
In his introduction to the report the minister of public instruction 
notes the existence of 5,131 classes in the public schools with more 
than 50 pupils and of 50 classes with more than 80 pupils. 
Average attendance.—As a means of estimating the average school 
attendance, it is customary to compare the actual attendance on a 
specified day in June and in December—the months of the lowest 
and highest attendance—with the total enrollment for those months. 
It appears from the comparison on this basis that the school attend- 
ance on December 2, 1901, was 79.3 per cent of the month’s enroll- 
ment, and on June 2, 1902, 74.9 per cent of the month’s enrollment. 
In 1906-7 the ratios of attendance in public primary schools to total
-P-A-G-E-432
  424 EDUCATION. REPORT, 1910. 
enrollment were as follows: December 1, 78.2 per cent; June 1, 74.6 
per cent. In the private primary schools, which attract, generally, a 
more select class of pupils, the ratios were higher, but the reporter 
observes that the statistics for the private schools are much less 
reliable than for the public schools. 
Certificate of primary studies.—The certificate of primary studies, 
instituted in 1834 and recognized by the law of 1882 as a means of 
stimulating an interest in elementary study, has conduced in part to 
the early withdrawal of pupils from school. The certificate exempts 
the holder from the obligation to attend school, and the reports show 
that a large proportion of children who come up to the examination 
for this award are at the minimum age (11 years) allowed for candi- 
dates. For the majority of the successful candidates the examination 
is the end of school life. In the twenty years 1877-1897 the number 
of certificates awarded rose from 36,841 to 186,031, an increase of 
404 per cent. The number of certificates obtained in 1907 was 
221,317, an increase in ten years of 19 per cent, which may be regarded 
as a normal growth. 
The higher primary schools—The most important evidence of a 
growing appreciation of education on the part of the French people 
is afforded by the progress of the higher primary schools to which only 
pupils are admitted who have gained the certificate of primary 
studies or have passed a required examination. This examination is 
not open to candidates under 13 years of age. The course of instruc- 
tion in the higher primary schools covers three years, to which a 
fourth may be added. 
The enrollment in the higher primary schools, which is included 
in Table 5, rose from 34,563 in 1901-2 to 45,978 in 1906-7, an increase 
of 33 per cent. The total for the last year named included 27,167 
boys and 18,518 girls. In addition to the organized higher primary 
schools, there are higher-grade classes (cours complémentaires) 
attached to elementary schools in places that have not yet made pro- 
vision for an independent high school. The enrollment in these 
classes rose in the period considered from 34,048 to 41,690. Alto- 
gether, the number of pupils in the higher primary grades had 
reached at the end of the half decade reviewed a total of 87,668 as 
against 68,611 in 1902. 
Attendance upon higher primary schools is encouraged by the| 
scholarship funds in aid of young people of ability whose parents 
can not bear the expense of supporting them during this extende 
period of study. The appropriation by the Government for thi: 
purpose in 1908 amounted to 750,000 frances ($150,000). 
The continued decline in the number of illiterates may be regarde 
as proof of the increasing efficiency of the schools. Attention wa

     called in the previous report of this series to the fact that from 1900 
to 1902 the’ratio of illiterate conscripts fell from 14.6 per cent of the 
otal number to 4.3 per cent. In 1906 it had fallen to 3.5 per cent. 
AGENCIES COMPLEMENTARY TO THE SCHOOLS. 
France is particularly noted for the number and variety of agencies 
tended to promote the intellectual, industrial, and social welfare 
f the masses after the brief period of school life is closed. Among 
he efforts of this kind in which the educational side is particularly 
mphasized are systematic courses of lessons for youths and adults 
d popular lectures conducted by teachers and professors of the 
egular schools. This work, fostered by the Government, has 
xtended throughout France. In 1907 the courses of lessons under 
ublic auspices were attended by nearly 600,000 students. 
Among private societies particularly active in the work of adult 
struction are the Ligue de I’Enseignement, the Polytechnic, the 
hilotechnic, and the Union frangaise de la jeunesse. The three 
ocieties last named maintain technical evening schools in addition 
o classes for general instruction. All the societies make provision 
lor public lectures, which are illustrated generally with the magic 
mtern. 
Intimately related to the work of the continuation classes is that 
f several supplementary agencies for promoting the social and 
dustrial welfare of the laboring classes. Among these may be 
entioned the associations of old pupils formed for mutual help- 
Iness, known generally as the “Petites A,’ which number now 
bout 8,000, comprising nearly 1,000,000 members. The remark- 
ble success of two recent congresses of the associations in the 
cademic district of Caen suggested to the Ligue de l’Enseignement 
e idea of uniting all the associations of this character in a grand 
ational congress. The proposition was approved by the Govern- 
ent, and the congress which convened on the 18th of July of the 
esent year at Havre, under the presidency of the minister of public 
struction, was opened by the President of the Republic in person. 
wo thousand delegates, representing 1,300 societies, participated in 
e sessions. Among the purposes of the “Petites A” are the collec- 
lon of funds for the benefit of members in cases of sickness, want of 
ployment, etc., and the encouragement of the members to increase 
eir preparation for business or other vocations by special courses

on the formation of a national union of the associations and a

       The conciliatory policy adopted by the Government toward th 
teachers’ federation and its encouragement to this national unio: 
of former pupils are new manifestations of the purpose to secure fo 
the Republic the loyal support of the people through the agency o 
the public schools. 
LIBRARIES AND MUSEE PEDAGOGIQUE. 
Among agencies auxiliary to the school should be included schoi 
libraries, which increased. from 43,411 with 6,977,503 volumes in 190! 
to 44,021 with 7,757,917 volumes in 1907, and teachers’ referenc| 
libraries, which, on account of consolidations, decreased during t 
half decade from 2,674 with 1,034,132 volumes to 1,131 with 673,27 
volumes. The crown of the auxiliary system is the Musée Péd 
gogique, which was reorganized in 1879 and has become the reco 
nized center of unifying and inspiring influences for the entire syste 
of public education. 
In its present form the Musée comprises a pedagogical library, 
publishing office or bureau of information, and an education 
museum. 
The library had 72,000 volumes in 1904 and reported 2,739 app 
cants for books and 26,180 volumes called for, of which 15,877 we’ 
loaned for consultation at home. 
Among the auxiliary services which the institution performs 
that of furnishing magic-lantern slides and other material for t! 
illustration of popular lectures and courses of instruction comi 
under the general name of continuation classes. The packages 
slides loaned in 1906 numbered above 7,000. Recently a speci 
office has been opened in the Musée Pédagogique as a center for 
the agencies, public and private, that are engaged in the great wo 
of popular education, supplementary to that of the primary schoo 
The building is provided with halls for meetings of public sch 
teachers and for lectures given by professors of higher educati 
The latter are intended chiefly for the benefit of teachers. 
Funds in aid of pupils (caisses des écoles), which, by law, evel 
commune should provide, numbered 17,376 in 1907. The total fu 
deposited amounted to 9,110,459 francs ($1,822,091.80) and the d 
bursements to 7,501,937 francs ($1,500,387.40). These funds 
used to furnish clothing to poor pupils and school dinners (canti 
scolaires). 
In Paris cantines were maintained in all the public schools in 1 
at an expense of 1,472,671 francs ($294,534). Of the total amo 
the city contributed 78 per cent, the remainder being met by 
pupils who purchased meals. The total number of meals served 
11,239,894, of which 7,835,058, or more than two-thirds, w 
gratuitous.
-P-A-G-E-435
  
EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 427 
With respect to this service, which is widely extended, the United 
States consul at Nantes, Mr. Louis Goldschmidt, reported recently 
as follows: 
The cantines are installed in each nonsectarian (public) school and are intended 
to furnish poor children with hot and nourishing food. In one of the rooms of the 
school there is a refectory where the meal takes place. At five minutes to 11 the 
children get out of their classes. They go into the courtyard, where, under the 
vigilant care of one of the schoolmasters, they wash their hands at the washstands, 
Then at 11 o’clock they place themselves in regular order and walk into the refectory. 
Each child, before entering this room, gives a check to the master. This check 
is given to the poorer children in an unobserved manner and without charge, and is 
sold at 15 centimes (3 cents) to the scholars whose parents are more able to pay. 
Thus the children’s pride is not hurt, there being no difference between the one 
who pays and the one who does not. 
The meal lasts three-fourths of an hour. Two of the older children are appointed 
to watch over the younger and see that they all secure their food. One of the masters 
also superintends the meals. The weekly bill of fare has been arranged as follows: 
Monday: Cabbage soup; sausage and beans. Tuesday: Bean soup; stew; jam. 
Wednesday: Meat soup; rice; pie. Thursday: No school. Friday: Vegetable soup; 
cod fish; rice. Saturday: Meat soup; sausages or blood pudding; beans. 
In addition each child receives half a pint of wine mixed with water. The food is 
cooked in the municipal free soup houses, called Fourneaux Municipaux. From 
there it is brought to the schools, where, if necessary, it is heated again before being 
served to the children. | 
In one of the schools on the first day 112 scholars were present, and a larger num- 
ber have since partaken of the meals. The school cantines are useful and humani- 
tarian, will certainly tend to the betterment of the poorer classes, and will no doubt 
help in securing better educational results. 
In all important particulars in respect to which the quinquennial 
report furnishes data for comparison, it appears that the public pri- 
mary schools made marked progress in the period 1902-1907. The 
number of schools increased, the number of teachers increased by 
larger proportion, and their financial condition was improved. This 
advance was accompanied by a decided increase in the public 
expenditure for primary instruction, as is shown in the following 
table:

The above table does not include the expenditure for school build- 
ings, amounting in 1907 to 30,500,000 francs ($6,100,000), borne by 
the State and communes together, nor the amounts expended for the 
same purpose by the larger cities which receive no aid from the 
State. The expenditure for private primary schools, which in 1907 
enrolled over a million children, is not reported. 
The government appropriation for the entire service of public 
instruction, which amounted in 1905 to 237,014,806 francs 
($47,402,961), reached the total of 274,513,609 francs ($54,902,722) 
in 1909, an increase of 37,498,803 francs ($7,499,760). 
The department of primary instruction necessarily receives the 
larger part of this appropriation, about 75 per cent, as the State has 
gradually assumed the entire current expenses of primary schools. 
The product of the local school tax is turned over to the public treas- 
ury; but it is only in the largest cities that this tax meets, even 
approximately, the amount required to run the schools. Paris, 
however, and a few other cities not only bear the whole burden of 
their primary schools but contribute, by the excess of their school 
tax, to the expenditure for the nation at large.

EDUCATION IN SPAIN. 
PRESENT UNREST. 
(The unrest which has pervaded Latin Europe in the past few years 
is taken the form of anti-clericalism, and has found expression in a 
ided opposition to the predominating influence of the clergy in 
ool matters. The school has long been the center of the struggle 
ween church and state in France, and lately has become so in 
lain. The struggle in the latter country attracted world-wide 
ention by reason of the events connected with the riots in 
rcelona in July, 1909, which culminated in the execution of Fran- 
co Ferrer, the well-known teacher and enthusiast for educational 
lorm. : 
errer’s zeal in the cause of reform had been manifested by the 
oduction into Spain of schools for the people, in which instruction 
given in accordance with the modern science of teaching in 
dern and practical subjects, but all religious instruction was 
luded from the curriculum. At his own expense he founded 120 
hese lay schools, and others of the same kind soon began to appear. 
‘he views of the Spanish clergy upon the lay or modern schools of 
type introduced by Sefior Ferrer are expressed in a protest 
inst them presented to the premier in November, 1909. 
his protest, after explaining that the lay schools were closed by 
Government as a consequence of the events occurring at Barce- 
, urges that they should not be reopened. This request is made 
m the grounds that antireligious education is an evil in itself, and 
ctly contrary to Spanish law. ‘‘The existence of such schools,” 
protest declares, ‘‘is opposed to the international law which is 
lominated the Concordat, Article II of which provides that ‘the 
ruction given in schools, whether public or private or of any sort, 
429 
 
-P-A-G-E-438
    430 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
shall in all respects be in strict conformity with the doctrines of t 
Catholic religion itself;’ with the law of public instruction, wh 
articles 295 and 296 prescribe the fulfillment [of the Concordat], s 
ting forth the regulations in connection therewith relative to t 
agreement between the two powers; and the fundamental law 
constitution of the Monarchy, whose Article XI forbids other ‘ pub 
demonstrations than those of the state religion,’ and a public dem 
stration is that of the professor who, in a public school, attacks 
the foundations of religion before his pupils.’’ 
The protest closes as follows:        
        
    
           
   
    
   
    
   
   
    
    
   
   
   
     In virtue thereof, it being an act of justice, and the law demanding that the 
called modern or lay schools, closed by order of the legitimate authority, be not ope! 
again, we hope and expect from the spirit of justice and of uprightness of Your Ex: 
lency, whose life God preserve many years, that the command of the law be carried 
The protest was subscribed by the cardinal of Spain and all 
Spanish archbishops and bishops. 
It is hardly necessary to recall at this time the intense excitem: 
throughout Europe over the unfortunate affair at Barcelona. 
regards education in Spain, the significant outcome of this aro 
sentiment was the resignation of the ministry, followed by the no 
nation of a moderate Liberal cabinet. Upon the recommendat 
of the new minister of public instruction, a royal decree was iss 
February 3, 1910, which, notwithstanding the ecclesiastical pro 
cited above, restricted the inspection of private schools to the hygi 
conditions of the premises and to providing for the preventio

The programme which Premier Canalejas has laid down, and in w] 
he confidently anticipates the support of the Cortes which was ele 
in May upon this issue, includes the revision of the Concordat of 1 
the registration and regulation of the religious orders, gove 
control of public education, and the recognition of freedom of 
science. 
STATE OF PRIMARY EDUCATION. 
It is difficult to form an adequate conception of the state of p 
lar education in Spain because the statistics are not sufficiently re 
and complete, but the general condition of primary schools and 
high rate of illiteracy are exciting alarm. The subject was consid 
at a recent assembly of the directors of primary education throug! 
the various Provinces of Spain, held at Madrid under the auspice 
the minister of public instruction and fine arts, who calls these 
cials together once a year for the purpose of obtaining reports 
the condition of schools, schoolhouses, and teachers in different 
of the Kingdom. These officials, reporting one by one as to c 
tions in their respective localities, were very nearly unanimo

        rotesting against the backwardness of primary education among the 
panish people. 
In 1860 the first attempt was made to gather official statistics in 
pain as to the percentage of literacy and illiteracy of the population. 
t that time it appeared that 75.52 per cent of the population could 
either write nor read. In 1877 the percentage was 72.01, in 1887 it 
as 68.01, and in 1900 it was 63.78, children of all ages being included 
these computations. From this it would appear that in forty 
ears there has been an improvement of nearly 12 per cent in literacy. 
‘he improvement has been doubtless mainly in the cities, where the 
ercentage of illiteracy is less than in the country regions. In the 
ear 1900 the population of Madrid was 539,825, while the number 
f illiterates was 163,743, or practically 30 per cent. In the same 
ear the population of Barcelona was 533,000, while the number of 
literates was 258,462, or about 48 per cent. 
The superior educational advantages offered by the cities, as well 
the general greater attractions of urban life and the larger oppor- 
ities there found for earning a living, have made emphatic here 
at which is apparent in nearly all civilized countries—the much 
eater proportionate increase in population in the cities than in the 
ral regions. From 1877 to 1900 the population of Spain increased 
out 12 per cent, but that of Madrid increased nearly 36 per cent, 
at of Barcelona about 114 per cent, that of Valencia upward of 
per cent, and of Bilbao more than 154 per cent. 
The school system of Spain has been worked out upon an elaborate 
an, which, theoretically, ought to accomplish excellent results. The 
partment of ‘‘public instruction and fine arts” comprises the fol- 
wing divisions: (1) Universities and institutes, (2) primary instruc- 
n and schools, (3) fine arts, (4) public buildings [for educational 
rposes], and the bureau of archives, libraries, museums, accounts, 
pyrights, official registers, exchange of publications, etc., all 
ministered under the immediate orders of the undersecretary of 
blic instruction. In the department of public instruction are also 
e Geographical and Statistical Institute, the royal academies, and 
e astronomical and meteorological observatories. There is like- 
e a council of public instruction and fine arts, which is a central 
msultative authority and which deals with all branches of the — 
partment of public instruction. 
The country is also divided academically into ten university dis- 
icts each under the control of a rector, and there is in each of these 
tricts a university council as a consultative authority. 
Public instruction is free of charge, attendance is compulsory 
tween the ages of 6 and 12, and elaborate machinery is provided 
obtaining complete registration of all children betwee those ages 
d for compelling their attendance at schools. The conditions dis-

    closed by the official reports indicate, however, that these laws are 
not generally enforced. 
Vaccination is compulsory and a certificate of recent vaccination 
is required for admittance to the public schools, yet smallpox pre: 
vails nearly all over Spain and is never absent from the large cities, 
The percentage of pock-marked people one sees in the army and i 
the streets is very large indeed. 
Christian doctrine is required to be taught and is taught in all th 
public schools, and the doctrine, naturally, is that of the Rom: 
Catholic Church. 
The prescribed courses of study are sufficient to give a good prima: 
education if the practical administration of the schools were as satis: 
factory as the theory of organization. 
According to the census for the year 1900, the number of prima: 
schools was 24,462, of which 22,654 were supported by the State an 
1,608 by some of the Basque provinces. 
A great number of the buildings used for school purposes are rente 
and are very poorly adapted for the purposes for which they are use: 
The rent paid by the State for school buildings in 1900 was 2,149,36 
pesetas ($414,827). The provisions for heating and ventilating ar 
very inadequate. The general heating apparatus is a brazier of coal! 
which necessarily gives out gases and a comparatively small amo: 
of heat, and causes headaches and stupor among the pupils. 
According to a memoria drawn up by the Count de Romanone 
until quite recently minister of education, during his four month: 
tenure of office there should have been in 1908, 34,366 public schoo 
in all Spain and the Canary and Balearic islands, while the numb 
of schools shown by the statistics to be in actual existence is 24,86 
or 9,579 less than are required by law. 
There were also 5,212 private schools in existence in the countr 
at that time, of which 508 were kindergarten schools, 2,010 were fi 
boys, 2,589 for girls, 57 were night schools, and 48 were Sund: 
schools. Of the whole number of private schools, 5,014 we 
Catholic institutions, 107 were so-called lay schools, and 91 we: 
classed as Protestant schools. 
The memoria dwells in particular upon the unsanitary conditi 
of the school buildings, the want of proper inspection, and the inad 
quate salaries of school-teachers, and, both by reason of its detail 
presentation of the facts and the remedies proposed, indicates 
determined purpose on the part of the Government to bring abo 
needed reforms. Minister de Romanones proposed to transfer t 
control of primary education entirely to the State; to replace t 
hired buildings by state schools to be paid for partly by the Sta) 
and partly by the municipalities; and to provide from state fun 
for a fixed minimum salary for the directors and teachers of prim

schools. The minister referred to, owing to his appointment to the 
presidency of the congress, is prevented from carrying out these 
reforms, but it is understood that his successor, Sefior Burell, fully 
intends to give practical effect to the proposed measures.     
      
   
    
     
               
   
               
     
    
   COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN JAPAN. 
There are five higher commercial schools in Japan, located, re- 
spectively, at Tokyo, Kobe, Yamaguchi, Nagasaki, and Osaka. The 
xpenses of the first four are defrayed by the Government and by 
ition fees. The Osaka school is supported by the municipality. 
‘he schools at Tokyo and Kobe have a four years’ course of study; 
he course in the three remaining schools covers three years. 
The Kobe Higher Commercial School was created by an imperial 
rder of 1902, and was established in May, 1903, under the direct 
ontrol of the minister of education. It differs from the other 
igher commercial schools by reason of special entrance conditions 
rovided for graduates from lower commercial schools. The pros- 
ects announces that— 
The course of study, extending over four years, consists of the preparatory and the 
rincipal courses. The preparatory course is divided into the first and second depart- 
ents and extends over one year, while the principal course is for three years. The

the president, hold office for a term of one year. S 
The Kofi-bu (literally, the department for elevating customs) has for its purpos 
the cultivation of a proper school spirit. To this end all the students are formed in’ 
about 50 clubs (yidan) according to the localities from which they come. Thest 
clubs hold meetings from time to time for the purpose of promoting developmen 
both in character and learning.

        Gun-making and metal-working schools of Iiege. 
Consul H. Abert Johnson, of Liege, furnishes the following report 
oncerning the two most important Belgian trade schools of his 
istrict, the gun-making and metal-working schools: 
New buildings have recently been erected for the use of the gun- 
aking school, covering an area of 2,872 square feet and costing 
bout $30,000. Pupils who have passed the requisite primary course 
the public schools are admitted to this school from the age of 12. 
he course of study comprises, among other things, a preparatory 
raining in the various branches of gun making, fashioning gun- 
tocks, assembling the parts of a gun, making the breech mechanism, 
urnishing, engraving on metal, etc., and in addition a course in 
ractical mechanics for those who are to become tool makers, a course 
the theory of arm construction, and, finally, a course in drawing. 
he school hours are from 8 a. m. to noon and 1.30 p. m. until 5. 
In the annual report attention is called to an element contributing 
lo the decrease in the number of pupils of the school. It asserts that, 
aking into consideration that machine work is continually becom- 
ig more generalized in all branches of industry, that of firearms 
cluded, it has been deemed necessary to organize in the school a 
ecial section for training a certain number of pupils in the handling 
ff machinery in general, and in particular those machines that are 
sed in gun making. Certain other leading industries of the locality, 
owever, notably that of the manufacture of automobiles, having 
uring the past few years experienced a period of marked prosperity 
at called for a decided increase in productive capacity, have in- 
eased their force of skilled mechanics by recruiting from other 
dustries through offers of increased wages. In this way many of 
e younger workmen were withdrawn from other industries, even 
fore they had completed their terms of apprenticeship, and it 
pears that this movement was especially noticeable in the fire- 
s industry, pupils of the firearms school having been attracted 
offers of higher wages than they would have received in the gun- 
aking trade after the completion of their course at the school. 
Machine-tool work. 
Realizing these conditions, a large number of the pupils of the 
hool of gun making desired to become enrolled in the section organ- 
d for the study of machine tools, so that the number in this depart- 
 
-P-A-G-E-444
  436 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
   
          
   
    
        
           
   
      
    
        
       ment of work largely increased, to the detriment of the other depart- 
ments of the school. Measures had to be taken to correct this 
tendency, and the committee decided to limit the number of pupils 
in the section devoted to the study of machine tools, establishing a 
maximum enrollment of forty pupils, and it was further decided that 
the work of these pupils should be confined almost exclusively to the 
classes of machine tools that are especially applicable to the gun- 
making industry. 
The report referred to asserts that although the demand for skilled 
mechanics in the automobile industry might at first tend to increase 
the number of pupils who aimed to perfect themselves in the 
handling of machine tools it would eventually bring about a decrease} 
in the number entering the school with ‘the intention of becoming} 
gunsmiths, thus tending to defeat, in a large measure, the object for| 
which the school had been established. 
Great demand for trained men. 
The pupils in the department of chasing and engraving, recentl 
introduced, have advanced so rapidly that there is danger of man 
of them leaving the school before the completion of the prescribe 
term, with the view of insuring a certain wage, by working either i 
their own homes or in factories. It is necessary, therefore, that th 
school authorities take some measures to prevent such action and t 
retain the pupils in the school until they have completed the cours 
and are prepared to take their place in the industry as first-clas 
workmen. To attain this end the school committee has decided, b 
way of experiment, to allot to each pupil a part of the value of th 
work performed by him, with the hope of thereby inducing him t 
complete the course. 
Graduates from this school are in demand and have little difficult 
in finding employment immediately after leaving the school, an 
the school authorities have decided to send each year to the variou| 
manufacturers of firearms a complete list of the graduates of th 
school. 
Besides the purely technical part of the school, the pupils enjo: 
the advantages of a certain amount of general instruction given i 
lectures on various subjects. Lessons are also given in hygiene i 
conformity with the programme of the Society of the Red Cross i 
Belgium. The pupils also have facilities for visiting the vario 
industrial establishments of the neighborhood under the guidance

opened in 1901. Pupils are admitted between the ages of 12 and 16 
years, but they are required to pass an examination in French, 
arithmetic, and geometrical drawing, and to be in good physical 
condition. Instruction is given free of charge to Belgian sub- 
jects. A midday meal is furnished to the pupils free of charge. 
The curriculum of the school comprises political economy, hygiene, 
arithmetic, geometry, mechanical drawing of machinery, bookkeep- 
ing, physics, chemistry, mechanics, algebra, the technology of the 
workshop and work in iron and wood, instruction in the construction 
of automobiles and cycles, etc. The practical instruction is given in 
the workshop established in the school, which is supplied with all 
the necessary tools and machinery. The course is arranged in such a 
manner as to permit the pupil, after two years of work in the school, 
to enter a factory of machine construction, a foundry, etc. 
The entire course comprises a third year of studies devoted to 
machine tools. This school is attended by 350 pupils.

     SCHOOL CHILDREN’S SAVINGS. 
Consul H. Abert Johnson, reporting from Liege, says that one of 
he elements contributing to the remarkable prosperity of Belgium 
nd of the great majority of Belgian financial and industrial enter- 
rises is undoubtedly to be found in their habits, as a people, of thrift 
nd judicious economy. He traces the outcome of this trait as 
eveloped in the schools: 
Some forty years ago a movement was initiated to encourage these 
abits of economy in the children attending the public schools. As 
the case of most innovations of this nature, practical results tending 
o confirm the wisdom of such a movement were slow in coming to 
he front. The movement found among the corps of teachers many 
upporters, while on the other hand a large majority of the professors 
nd teachers resolutely opposed it. By some it was asserted that the 
rganization of such a service would prove to be a cause of disorder 
nd a lack of discipline in the schools; others expressed doubts as to 
e efficacy of such a departure. However, after a time an agreement 
as reached, and January 1, 1869, the communal council decided to 
ut the plan in operation. 
Liege at that epoch possessed some twenty primary schools. The 
tal sum deposited by the scholars of fifteen of these schools during 
is first year was $2,589. Two years later the total amount deposited 
as reduced to $483 for ten schools, and in 1874 only nine schools out 
twenty-five put into practice this system of saving on the part of 
e scholars, although during this year the total amount deposited 
ached $942.

Modifications that led to success. 
Such meager results, it must be admitted, were not encouraging, and 
held out scant hope for the ultimate success of the movement. Shortly 
after this the communal council again took up the question, and after 
certain modifications had been agreed upon, these savings institutions 
seem to have been established on a more solid basis, and from that 
time up to the present they have continued to prosper in a highly sat- 
isfactory manner. The objections on the part of those opposing the 
movement seem to have been eventually overcome, so that the institu- 
tion was then introduced into every school. In 1876 a philanthropic 
citizen of Liege donated 1,000 francs ($193), to be used in the pur- 
chase of savings deposit books, to be distributed to children whose 
means were limited. Later he gave 2,000 francs, the interest on which 
was to be given as a prize each year to the director or directress of 
that school in which the greatest amount of zeal was shown on the 
part of the teaching body to encourage the idea of saving among the 
children. In 1875 another Liege philanthropist gave 6,000 francs, to 
be distributed during the period of twenty years to the most meritori- 
ous scholars of the primary schools who took advantage of the savings 
institution. These generous actions contributed in a large measure 
to the prosperity of the movement. To-day, when the ideas of thrift 
have become such a part of the life of every nation, the desire to 
save and economize has taken a complete hold on the school children 
of this locality, and the teaching element has taken up the idea with) 
enthusiasm and are doing everything to further its development. 
The figures given by the latest statistics conclusively show that thi 
period of experiment has passed, and that the idea of an institutio 
for school children’s savings has become an integral part of the public 
school system of this locality. The total amounts deposited by th 
scholars of the Liege public schools at the beginning of the las 
scholastic year reached $55,158, to which may be added the $36,98 
deposits made during the year. The interest paid by the governmen’ 
savings banks on these deposits amounted to $1,361. The amount 
withdrawn by different pupils of the schools amounted only t 
$21,486. The total amount deposited by the school children at th 
end of last July reached $71,778. 
     
    
                             
     
    
    
    
   
     PUBLIC LIBRARIES. 
In the following report from Liege, Consul H. Abert Johnson tell 
of the plans in Belgium to equip public libraries with books of great 
benefit to the people: 
For some years the provincial council has granted subsidies 
certain libraries known as “‘bibliothéques populaires,” organized b
-P-A-G-E-447
  EDUCATIONAL NOTES FROM CONSULAR REPORTS. 439 
provincial communes for the purchase of books. In their selection 
too decided an inclination was shown for works of somewhat question- 
able utility, mostly novels and fiction, while the subsidies were granted 
with the idea that preference would be given to scientific works and 
those on social and economic questions. In order to correct this the 
provincial authorities have provided for a competent board to super- 
vise such purchases. It will prepare a catalogue of books, the pur- 
chase of which is obligatory on those communes receiving subsidies. 
In preparing these catalogues the board will be governed in each case 
by local needs and conditions, the character of its industries, and the 
intellectual progress of its inhabitants. 
This movement seems to meet with general approval, and it is 
believed that the catalogues will prove especially beneficial in small 
and isolated townships, where difficulties would often arise in selecting 
competent. persons to purchase books for a public library.     
                     
    
     
    
    
      
     
     
    
   
         
NETHERLANDS. 
School for Training Officers for the Fishing Fleet. 
Consul Henry M. Morgan, of Amsterdam, furnishes the following 
information concerning the fishing school at Ymuiden for training 
aptains and mates for the Dutch fishing fleet: 
Since the opening of the fishers’ harbor at Ymuiden, in 1896, the 
ort has become the principal fishing center of the Continent. In 
he year 1908 over $2,000,000 worth of fish was sold in the fish mar- 
ets of the town. This was largely exported in daily shipments to 
‘oreign countries by rail in a fresh state. In view of the importance 
f this industry a school was started in 1906 at Ymuiden with the 
dea of obtaining in the future a staff of thoroughly trained captains 
nd mates for sailing and steam fishing boats. Although the school 
as been in operation for only two and one-half years the results 
btained are very satisfactory. 
Every Dutch boy who has passed successfully the physical exam- 
ation and can show a good character from the public school which 
e attended can obtain permission to enter the school, which is 
ivided into three classes. 
The first class, the work of which covers a period of one year, starts 
November, and is for boys just leaving school, between 13 and 16 
ears of age, who are taught arithmetic, geometry, the Dutch and 
nglish languages, shipbuilding, geography, practical and theoretical: 
lavigation, laws of navigation, steam mechanics, refitting of ves- 
Is, first aid in case of accidents, making and repairing sails, nets, 
c. The theoretical work is done on shore in the schoolroom; the

puts out to sea from February to October.

    From November till February the boys remain on shore; afterwards 
they are sent to sea in the fishing vessel, five boys at a time, for eight 
days, and so on till October. During their stay in the harbor the boys 
sleep on board the instruction vessel, so that they may become accus- 
tomed to a life on board ship. This instruction vessel is fitted out 
for ten boys and is under the supervision of a captain and his wife; 
the captain gives practical lessons in repairing, refitting, etc. The 
boys have forty hours class work a week, of which fourteen hours are 
practical work. After the first year they can obtain a certificate from 
the board of directors, who find employment for them on board sailing 
vessels, so that they can learn fishing thoroughly and earn their own 
living. Their wages are about $10 per month. The board provides 
each boy with a whaling suit of cloth, shoes, ete., on entering the 
school, but the boys are obliged later to refund the money out of their 
own earnings, from which 20 per cent is deducted and paid direct by 
the captain of the vessel on which the boy is serving to the board of 
directors. The cost of such an outfit is about $24 per boy. 
After having spent two or three years at sea the boys return to the 
school to prepare’in the second class for the government examina- 
tion for the certificate of mate of fishing vessels, which preparation| 
occupies about five months. After another year at sea they retur: 
for the last course of three months in the third class, which prepare: 
them for the government examination to obtain their certificate o 
captain, so that in six years the whole course can be done. In th 
last two classes they work twenty-two hours a week. 
For the first course no fee is paid, but for the last two course: 
pupils have to pay $1. If a pupil is not considered diligent enoug 
or if he goes to sea before having obtained a certificate from th 
board after the first year, he is immediately dismissed and his par 
ents or relations are compelled to refund the money paid for hi 
outfit. The society was started by voluntary contributions and th 
Government lent the two training vessels. In several other port 
there are similar schools, but this is the only one in which lesson| 
are given the whole year round. At the end of the first year twelv} 
certificates were given to the pupils, for whom employment w: 
found on the different fishing boats and trawlers of Ymuiden. Th] 
reports from the captains of these boats concerning the work of t 
pupils are satisfactory up to the present.

TECHNICAL SCHOOLS. 
Hamburg’ s broad system of giving scientific instruction. 
    
   
              
   
      
   
                 
   
     Consul-General Robert P. Skinner explains the comprehensive 
facilities afforded in the German State of Hamburg to fit pupils for 
technical and scientific positions of trust: 
The public school system of Hamburg includes a technological 
institute, known here as the Technikum, and which is, in part, a con- 
tinuation school, and certain continuation schools pure and simple. 
The technological institute provides an opportunity for scientifig 
education in the following branches: Construction of machinery, elec- 
tro-technology, shipbuilding, construction of ship machinery, and 
marine engineering. For all of these branches regular lectures and 
exercises are provided. The Technikum includes also a preliminary 
school for the following branches: Shipbuilding and construction of 
machinery and electro-technology. 
The Technikum educates pupils for positions as technical mana- 
gers, managing officers, and constructing engineers, especially for 
marine engineering, and as thoroughly trained engineers for the 
commercial fleet. The teaching staff includes thirty-five specialists 
and technicists, all experts. The instruction continues two years, 
and in the preliminary schools six months. 
To be admitted it is necessary to possess a certificate showing that 
the student is required to serve one year only in the army, or a 
“patent” as a marine machine engineer of the first class. He must 
prove that he has had two years of practical experience prior to 
seeking entrance, and if he is unable to furnish proof of sufficient pre- 
paratory training he is obliged to pass an examination which he is 
authorized to take’ only after having had three years of practical 
experience. The final examinations take place before a board of 
commissioners. The annual tuition fee is 144 marks ($34.27) in the 
ordinary course of instruction, and 50 marks ($11.90) for instruction 
in the preliminary school. 
A certificate from this school enables the holder to enter the 
‘middle career’ in the Prussian railroad system, to entrance into 
he technological institutions of the German infantry and artillery, 
to the imperial patent office, and into the ‘‘medium technical” 
ervice of the imperial navy. Marine engineers graduated from the 
chool are entitled to act as second engineers on shipboard, and after 
aving been so employed for two years may then become first engi- 
eers without further examination.

    The carriage-building school is a special branch of the Technikum, 
in which students are instructed to be cartwrights, wheelwrights, 
and coach builders. There are two classes in which the course of 
study is six months each. Pupils must be able to furnish proof of 
sufficient practical experience before entering, and a final examina- 
tion must be passed. This school possesses an important collection 
of models. The tuition fee is 60 marks ($14.28) for six months’ 
course. 
The building-trades school is also a special branch of the Gewer- 
beschule providing instruction in overhead and underground con- 
struction, graduating masons, stonecutters, and carpenters. Pupils 
have an opportunity of acquiring special theoretical knowledge and 
practice in technical drawing, whereby they are enabled to accept 
positions as medium technicists or to become architects. There are 
two departments of five classes each, one beginning in the winter 
and one in the summer. A final examination must be passed before 
a board of examiners. Pupils can also be prepared for entrance by 
taking a preliminary course in the building-trades school. The tui- 
tion fee for the six months’ course is 90 marks ($21.32). 
Applied arts school. 
The art school is still another branch of the Technikum intended 
for pupils desiring to become draftsmen, workmasters, and foremen. 
The following are the departments: Architectural decoration of in- 
teriors, plastic art, decorative painting, art of proportion, measure- 
ment and dimension, bookbinding, the working of precious metals, 
photography, technique of reproduction, hand and machine em 
broidery, and drawing. There is also a preliminary school to fi 
pupils for entrance. 
In the evening and Sunday classes of the art school apprentices i 
the different trades have an opportunity to cultivate the art of draw: 
ing, and to this extent it is a continuation school. The tuition fee i 
24 marks ($5.71) for six months, day instruction, and 10 marks 
($2.38) for six months, evening instruction. 
Continuation mercantile schools. 
The continuation schools of Hamburg, properly speaking, provid 
mercantile instruction for men and women. In the men’s schoo) 
there are courses of study in German, English, French, Portuguese} 
Spanish, and Danish, writing, commercial arithmetic, bookkeepin; 
commercial correspondence, stenography, and general commerci: 
knowledge. Work begins at 7 p. m. in eight different schools in th 
city. The tuition fee is 6 marks ($1.42) for a six months’ cour:

       from which fee pupils without means are entirely exempted. The 
winter course continues from October to March, and the summer 
course from April to September. 
It is provided in paragraphs 120 and 154 of the German trades 
aw that employers shall allow sufficient time to their apprentices 
under 18 years of age to enable them to frequent the commercial 
continuation schools. All apprentices in commercial establishments 
lare recommended to become students in these schools, so that they 
may receive the necessary theoretical and professional instruction 
while, at the same time, they work practically. 
There are two continuation schools for women, in which German, 
Mnglish, French, and Spanish, writing, typewriting, stenography, 
rithmetic, bookkeeping, correspondence, and drawing are taught. 
hese courses begin at 5 and at 7 p.m. The afternoon courses are 
reparatory, while the evening courses are intended for women who 
re employed. 
Pupils are only admitted if they have passed the first class of the 
ublic schools, or have received preparatory training of another 
haracter. The courses begin in April and October, and the tuition 
‘ee for six months’ instruction is 6 marks ($1.42). 
Hamburg navigation school. 
The Hamburg navigation school is open to pupils who can prove 
hat they have had forty-five months of practical experience prior to 
mtering; they must have been seamen for twenty-four months, 
lwelve of which must have been passed on sailing vessels; or, they 
ust have served as mate for twenty-four months, after having 
assed the examination entitling them to accept such a position. 
‘he preliminary courses are open to any sailor having made at least 
me voyage. Since October 1, 1891, a school for marine engineers 
as been connected with the navigation school. 
An imperial inspector is always present during the final examin- 
tions. 
School for blacksmiths. 
Vice-Consul James L. A. Burrell describes the operation of the 
erman School for Blacksmiths at Halberstadt, in the Magdeburg 
istrict: ; 
Young smiths receive instruction in shoeing oxen and horses and 
eparation for the examination in shoeing, which was made compul- 
ry in the German Empire by the imperial act of July 1, 1883, and 
held in the various provinces by state examining commissions. The 
hool is supported by appropriations from the city, the province, 
d from the two agricultural associations in Halberstadt. The 
urses of instruction last three months and four of them are given

   during the year, beginning each quarter. The theoretical instruc- 
tion is in charge of a retired military veterinary surgeon. The charge 
for the practical and theoretical instruction, including the use of iron, 
etc., is only 25 marks ($5.95) for the course. Board and lodging 
can be had in the school very cheaply. For young blacksmiths with- 
out means four free courses, with board and lodging, are provided 
each year. Candidates who pass excellent examinations receive pre-| 
miums. Only six persons may take part in each course of instruction, 
Mercantile progress. 
Deputy Consul-General Simon W. Hanauer writes from Frankfort 
that to cultivate the artistic taste of German storekeepers and thei 
salespeople the German Association for Mercantile Education, wit 
the aid of the German Work League, has recently instituted instruc 
tion courses of six weeks’ duration in the cities of Berlin, Leipzig 
Halle, Halberstadt, Magdeburg, and Brunswick. A number of othe: 
German cities will now also receive these instruction courses, whic. 
are directed by distinguished art critics, experts in trade, design 
and fashion. Subjects of instruction have hitherto been the art o 
decorating dwellings, draperies and clothing, the manufacture of ar. 
tistic small wares, and the decorating of shop windows. There is n 
doubt that this system of educating manufacturers and sellers so a: 
to attain high artistic taste and beauty of style in production will en. 
hance German reputation and promote the sale of German produc 
tions to foreign countries.   
AUSTRIA. 
AUSTRIAN TEXTILE COLLEGE. 
A new Austrian school for instruction in textile industries i 
described as follows by Vice-Consul Edward T. Heyn, of Reichenberg} 
Early in 1910 a new spinning school, erected by the Reichenber, 
Chamber of Commerce and Trade, was opened here, which is sai 
to be the most complete institution of the kind on the European co 
tinent, and as large as any in Great Britain, the home of textile: 
It is the first of its kind in Austria. 
The new institution has been united with an already existing wea’ 
ing school, and, in honor of the sixtieth jubilee of the Austria: 
Emperor, received the name ‘‘Emperor Franz Josef Technic 
School for Textile Industry.” A fine new building to house bot 
schools has been erected at a cost of $118,755. The Austrian mini 
try of public works contributed to the building fund, and the scho 
- will be under its charge and annually receive government support. 
When the plan of erecting a spinning school was first suggeste| 
objection was raised on the ground that only practical knowledge w: 
necessary in spinning, which could be best obtained in a factor
-P-A-G-E-453

However, the leading authorities in Austria, both scientific and in 
business life, were agreed that a thorough theoretical knowledge was 
a valuable aid in practical work. The spinning school in its theoret- 
ical instruction will therefore devote attention to the physical and 
hemical qualities of fibers; consider the machines necessary for spin- 
ing; their theoretical and practical construction; and, finally, in 
lectures, give students an idea of how a spinning factory should be 
roperly established and managed. The practical instruction in the 
orkshops consists of active operation and regulation of machines 
s in regular spinning mills. 
Equipment of various departments. 
The first division of the school is devoted to cotton spinning, com- 
ined with a combing department; the second to cotton waste—that 
s, to the spinning of imitation and vicuna yarns; another to worsteds 
nd carded yarns. The cotton-spinning division contains a complete 
leaning apparatus and various systems of cotton openers, so that the 
orking of every kind of raw material is possible. The cotton spin- 
ery is also provided with six carding machines of various construc- 
ions, two stretchers, seven fine spinning machines, self-acting and ring- 
lension machines for thread and warp yarns. Especially equipped 
the cotton-combing establishment, which, besides a preparing 
achine, contains four kinds of combing machines. The division for 
ool spinning possesses a large willow and two carding machines, one 
ff which serves for the manufacture of rough wool for threads and 
arps. The worsted department, established according to a French 
stem, comprises a combing department and a yarn and warp spin- 
ing equipment. 
The Reichenberg Textile School aims not only to train practical 
orkers for weaving and spinning, but also in other directions ex- 
lects to be useful to industry. For this purpose it has established 
extensive laboratory, with all kinds of apparatus, for examining 
ers and fabrics and for instruction purposes. It is also hoped to 
tablish a dyeing and finishing department. The weaving depart- 
ent is two large workshops, where practical instruction is given in 
nd weaving on forty-five looms. It also possesses the necessary 
ols for spooling, beaming, scissoring, cleaning, and designing; a 
orkshop for mechanical weaving, with twenty-seven looms and eight 
eparing machines; weaving looms of every description; also one 
orthrop loom (invented in Massachusetts). Finally, all technical 
stems for cotton and wool spinning and weaving, especially those 
ployed in the production of gentlemen’s and ladies’ cloth, carpets, 
lyeteens, plushes, furniture and decorative material, and also linen 
d silk weaving machines.

NATIONAL COLLEGES FOR DISSEMINATING EXPERT KNOWLEDGE. 
Consul Jerome A. Quay reports that at Florence there are three 
agricultural schools, all of them located at the Cascine park. He 
describes these Italian institutions as follows: 
The first building is especially adapted for the study of gardening, 
This model school is the only one of the kind in Italy and accepts also 
foreign students. The instruction, both practical and manual, is} 
extended to all work which is performed within hothouses, orchards, 
and gardens. After the pupils have undergone a certain amount o 
preliminary instruction they are taken to the orchards, then to th 
kitchen gardens, and thence to the flower gardens and hothouses, 
where they have practical instruction in the pruning of fruit trees. 
grafting of ornamental and fruit trees and domestic and America: 
vines, sowing and transplanting, preparing, keeping, and planting o: 
seeds, preparation of vegetables for the market, forced cultivation o 
fruits and vegetables, cultivation in hothouses, tepidarium and open: 
air culture of ornamental trees, plants, etc., and by this means th 
pupils acquire the necessary experience and skill in their profession| 
The second building is for girls. The teaching comprises: Agron: 
omy, floriculture, gardening, poultry breeding, bee-keeping, the cul 
ture of silk cocoons, dairying, housekeeping, cooking, sewing, an 
dressmaking, as well as a general course of school instruction. 
The scholars come from the better class of society, and when the 
have obtained their degree, which can be accomplished in about thre: 
years, it is the purpose of the school to send its graduates throug! 
the principal agricultural districts of Italy to disseminate thei 
knowledge among the country folk who are interested in the cultiv 
tion of fruits, vegetables, and general farm products. 
The third and last building is occupied by the Agricultural Col 
nial Institute founded by Prof. Gino Bartolommei Gioli, who live 
for many years in Italian Africa. The school course comprises t! 
teaching of colonial farming, the rearing and management of li 
stock, poultry breeding, felling of timber, etc., especially for you: 
men who wish to settle in the Italian colony of Africa.

ablished at Tiraspol for the instruction of the viticulturists of the 
ssian province of Kherson, whose vineyards were planted without 
ard to uniformity or quality of the vines, many varieties of grapes 
ing grown even in the smallest vineyards. The output, not being 
e to any sample and poor in keeping quality, realized less than 
half the price of that produced by the more experienced German 
lers in the same province. The new school is expected in time to 
duce more satisfactory results. 
  
AMERICAN SCHOOLS IN TURKEY.

        schools, and orphanages. Much has been written of the great educ: 
tional institutions conducted under American auspices in Beiru 
Smyma, and Constantinople, but in the interior of the count 
where outsiders scarcely ever come, there are schools and college 
turning out hundreds of scholars each year, who, along with oth 
studies, have taken a complete course in English. The most impo 
tant of these are situated at the following places: 
Marzovan: Anatolian college for boys, a school for girls, an industrial school, and 
orphanage. ‘ : 
Sivas: A normal school, a girls’ school, an industrial school, and several orphanag 
Talas-Cesaria: Schools for boys and girls, a kindergarten, and an orphanage. 
Erzerum: Schools for boys and girls and an orphanage. 
Harput: The Euphrates College, for boys; an industrial school, a kindergarten, a: 
several orphanages. 
Marash: Girls’ college and an orphanage. 
Van: Schools for boys and girls and an orphanage. 
Bitlis: Girls’ school and an orphanage. 
Mardin: Schools for boys and girls. 
Aintab: Central Turkey College, a girls’ school, three primary schools, and 
orphanage. 
Ourfa: Schools for girls and boys and an orphanage. 
Throughout the Empire there are 132 American educational ai 
charitable institutions, and in all of these the English language 
taught, to a greater or lesser extent. The graduates of the theologi 
seminaries and the physicians connected with the medical college

Another great means for the spread of the English language amo:

who are proud of their English-speaking capacity, who teach it 
their children, and who send their children to the American missi 
schools to learn the language properly.

RAILWAY SCHOOLS IN CAPE COLONY. 
Consul-General Julius G. Lay, of Cape Town, transmits the foll 
ing report concerning the establishment of railway schools in isola 
parts of Cape Colony: 
A railway school system has been devised and inaugurated for 
education of children living in out-of-the-way places, and it has 
been utilized in cases of railway employees in centers of considera 
population. Statistics of these railway schools for 1908 show t 
there are forty-one schools on the railways, with total enrollmen 
2,133 pupils. Many of these children would have no educati 
advantages if it were not for the railway schools established especi:

   or them. The expense to the Cape government railways for these 
chools was $28,367 for the year 1907. 
Wherever railway employees in isolated places can guarantee an 
verage attendance of ten children or more, not otherwise provided 
‘or by the railway schools, the railway department and the education 
epartment, acting conjointly and each furnishing half the expense, 
rovide suitable premises and a certificated teacher, at a salary of 
390 to $487 per annum and quarters. 
Children of railway employees are carried to and from these schools 
ree of charge, and are charged slightly lower fees than in the regular 
overnment public schools; they must also provide their own books 
nd stationery. No objection is raised to the attendance of the chil- 
ren of farmers who also may be living beyond the convenience of 
y government public school. An official of the railway, known as 
e education officer, acts as manager of all the railway schools, and 
here there are a sufficient number of parents they form local com- 
ittees to assist him in managing the affairs of the school. He is 
ways more or less guided by the opinions of the station masters or 
ead officials of the railway. The schools are inspected regularly by 
e inspectors of the educaticn department, and the children are 
idvanced according to the standards of the public-school system. 
Children attending these railway schools range in age from 5 to 15 
lears, over 20 per cent of the children being over 15. They are taken 
far as the seventh standard, which comprises a knowledge of the 
llowing subjects: Arithmetic, euclid, algebra, grammar, history, 
ictation, composition, writing, reading, botany, geography, sewing, 
utch, French, and Latin. The schools are supplied with libraries, 
rnished by railway and education departments, the expense being 
vided in the same manner as other school expenditure. The total 
mber of volumes in these school libraries is now 4,703. There is no 
mpulsory education in Cape Colony, and 134 children of railway 
ployees, it is stated, did not attend any school in 1908, for various 
asons. 
The Pretoria Normal College, in the chief city of the Transvaal, 
s a large campus on which adequate space is reserved for tennis 
urts and other games honored in English schools, and still more 
ple space for an experimental school garden, which forms an 
dispensable adjunct of the course in nature study. This course 
s been carefully worked out, and it is intended that every teacher 
0 goes out from the normal school shall be well fitted to stimulate 
e interest of elementary pupils in agriculture, and thus prepare the 
y for a general support of agricultural schools and a diffused 
preciation of scientific methods in the cultivation of the soil and 
le treatment of crops.

In the series of leaflets published by this institution during th 
present year, No. 5, devoted to nature study, consists of specime 
pages from the notebooks of students. The notes and accompanyin| 
illustrations are so arranged as to show very clearly the sequence 
topics in the course and the careful and thorough manner in whic| 
the instruction is carried out. The endeavor on the part of ti 
normal school to stimulate an interest in this fundamental indust: 
accords with the purpose of the British Government which, fro: 
the time of its occupation of the country, gave special attention 
the organization and proper staffing of the department of ag 
culture. The Transvaal is, in the main, a stock-raising country, b 
there are portions well adapted for agriculture, and it has been deem: 
of first importance to specialize in agricultural schools as the co 
ditions of the country suggest. Particular attention has been pa: 
to the steppe regions which are said to resemble in many respects t 
plateau regions of our own Southwestern States.

STUDENTS OF WOOL INDUSTRY. 
In announcing that the Sydney Technical College (an Australi 
state government institution) has opened a department for spec’ 
instruction in the wool and sheep industry, Vice-Consul-Gene: 
Henry D. Baker explains its curriculum: 
The course of instruction includes sheep classing, sheep judgi 
wool sorting, wool classing, preparing wool for the market, yields 
wool, valuation of wool, uses and qualities of wool, scouring wo 
fellmongering skins, shearing-shed work, and wool-trade usages. 
The method of training the students in this industry is most use 
and practical. It is framed to fit them to undertake the classifi 
tion, skirting, rolling of fleeces, and sorting skirts or pieces to 
best advantage to the grower, and also to meet the demands of 
buyers. As the practical work advances, lectures on all subje 
relating to the growing of wool and its suitability for manufact 
ing purposes are given. Advantage is taken of the Sydney wool s: 
to get students acquainted with the general routine of the wool b 
ness, and how wool should be prepared to suit the requirements| 
the various nations which import supplies from Australia. 
Instruction begins the first week in February and terminates 
July 31, at the time of the Sydney sheep show and stud sheep sa! 
These two events afford valuable opportunities for study, and se 
as finishing lessons to those students who intend adopting station 
as a profession. After the term expires students who have obtai

eir professional certificates in wool classing and have had sufficient 
ed experience may be recommended as wool classers and sorters. 
ther students who have been industrious and are desirous of going 
1 to stations to gain shed experience at the wool tables are recom- 
ended to squatters to skirt, roll fleeces and sort pieces. 
Unskirted and unclassed wools are purchased from time to time 
_order to give experience in classing and sorting, and, to students 
ho intend to take up station life, a thorough knowledge of skirting, 
ling, and making up the fleeces in the best marketable styles. 
rrangements are made with smaller wool growers or agents to send 
ich lots to the college for classification, the wools classed under this 
rangement bearing the college stamp. Sheep classing is also 
ught, after the knowledge necessary for sheep classing has already 
sen imparted, by study of the wool. Visits are made for this purpose 
. the sheep-sale yards and meat-preserving works under superinten- 
ance of an expert lecturer. 
During shearing time the students handle sheep and wool in the 
eds. Instruction is given in scientific examination of wool, includ- 
g use of the microscope, the action of reagents, the structure and 
pearance of hair follicles and their growth, and the effects of dye- 
g, dipping compounds, scouring, ‘carbonization,’ climate, food, etc. 
Some classes have also been formed for training machine sheep- ; 
earing experts to meet the needs of station owners and managers. 
e instruction includes work in elementary sheet-metal working, 
mitary engineering, blacksmithing, carpentry, and fitting and turn- 
A plant consisting of the most modern sheep-shearing machines, 
nm by oil engines, is installed in the college premises. This course 
complete in two sessions, each of six months. There is also a class 
instruction in sheep shearing only, which is completed in one 
m of two months’ duration. The object of this class is to give 
ung men the opportunity of obtaining a sound, practical knowl- 
ge of shearing. Various types of machines are provided for this 
ss. The instruction in classing and sorting wool covers two years, 
which. diplomas are given.

WESTERN LEARNING IN CHINA. 
     
  ice-Consul C, L. L. Williams, of Chefoo, forwards the following 
ort, prepared by Mr. A. W. Gilbert, of that consulate, on western 
rning in the Chinese province of Shantung: 
t is claimed by some that there are 1,000 government and private 
ools in the province of Shantung that teach western branches of 
         
  
-P-A-G-E-460
  452 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
learning, but in the absence of official or other reliable statistics tl 
claim can not be verified. The Chinese, however, are showing unusu 
zeal in acquiring a working knowledge of English, which is gradual 
becoming the international language of commerce in the Empire, a1 
especially in the coast towns. The province of Shantung contains | 
districts, in each of which there is at least one elementary scho 
while some districts have more than one. The intermediary or midc¢ 
schools in the province number 13. 
There is an imperial provincial college at Chefoo, where tl 
French and Japanese languages hitherto held the place of fir 
importance. These will in the future be dropped to second or thi 
rank of importance. There are 10 other higher government instit 
tions in the province devoted especially to western learning. In the 
schools 1,900 students are enrolled, 63 Chinese teachers are employe 
and 9 Japanese, 4 American, and 2 German teachers. 
In Chefoo there are 4 private schools for boys and 2 for girls giv 
to western learning, and employing 18 Chinese and 3 foreign teac 
ers. At Chingchowfu is a flourishing sericultural college founded } 
a Japanese who introduced a variety of Japanese cocoon. 
Mission Schools and Colleges. 
A careful inquiry into the extension of schools for western educ 
tion in this province reveals the fact that by far the most extensi: 
and effective work is being done by the Protestant missionaries, t 
most of them being Americans. This work is conducted under t' 
supervision of college graduates, many of them being professior 
teachers. The schools (American and English) are graded accor 
to the home standards, and thoroughness seems to be the keyno 
Probably half of those enrolled pay their own expenses at school ai 
are doing good work. The small schools in the country prepare pup} 
for the higher schools at the mission stations, which are always locat 
near a principal city, and these in turn prepare students for 
colleges and seminaries. With the exception of those who h 
“picked up” their English, most of the English-speaking clerks a) 
employees come from the mission schools. 
There are six mission institutions of higher learning, American aj 
English, located at Tengchow, Hwanghsien, Weihsien, Chingcho 
Tsinanfu, and Taianfu. A movement is now under way which 
unite all these, together with some of the German schools, into Sh 
tung Union University. 
In Shantung are 134 mission schools for boys with an enrollm 
of 2,186 and 40 schools for girls with an enrollment of 835. Of 
220 teachers for these schools, 180 are Chinese and 40 are foreign 
The average salary paid a native missionary teacher for boys is 
per month, and $2 per month is paid for women teachers. The nai

         Special lines of educational work. 
Aside from the common schools at Chefoo, are the two schools for 
the deaf (boys and girls); the Chefoo Industrial Mission schools in 
the silk district to the southwest, engaged in the manufacture of 
silk lace, etc., the mission buying the product and putting it on the 
market; the China Inland Mission boys’, girls’, and primary and 
kindergarten schools for foreign children; and the French school 
for foreign boys. A private school for foreign boys is also located 
at Wei-hai-wei and an embryo American school for foreign children 
has recently been opened at Hwanghsien. 
In this connection, also, should be mentioned the English Baptist 
museum at Tsinanfu and the Chefoo museum of the American Pres- 
byterian mission. This institution has a very large collection of 
mounted birds, fish, minerals, and stones, besides seals, wildcats, 
weasels, rabbits, water buffalo, wild boar, leopards, etc. The daily 
verage attendance is about 300, and, like the Tsinanfu museum, has 
chapel attached. 
Outside the medical missionaries, there are only two foreign prac- 
icing physicians reported in this district. The 14 medical mission- 
ries, with their 6 hospitals and 14 dispensaries, annually treat over 
00,000 persons. A union medical college is now in process of con~ 
truction at Tsinanfu, and is part of the Shantung Union University 
cheme. This university now has a union college at Weihsien and a 
nion theological seminary at Chingchowfu. 
Commercial forerunner. 
The medical branch of missions is probably doing more toward 
reconciling the Chinese to foreign association than any other agency. 
n Weihsien, where no foreigner has hitherto been permitted to live, 
n American medical missionary has recently opened a dispensary. 
uring a recent overland trip to that city, the mention of acquaint- 
nce with the missionary invariably put me on a friendly footing. 
uch contact with their work forces the conclusion that the mis- 
onaries are practical forerunners of commercial enterprise. They 
Idom fail to win the respect and esteem even of those who do not 
cept their doctrines, and thus unconsciously pave the way for 
rther foreign intercourse. 
The haste to make a flattering financial showing on the part of 
reigners has been an important factor in delaying commercial inter- 
urse in this country. However, a moderate respect for Chinese 
stoms and laws, a friendly interest in the people as prospective 
stomers, and normal business methods are doing much toward 
ercoming antipathy to foreign enterprise.

     German-Chinese school at Tsingtau. 
Consul Wilbur T. Gracey, of Tsingtau, transmits the following 
information regarding the new German educational scheme in the 
colony of Kiaochow: 
A recent local newspaper, the Tsingtauer Neueste Nachrichten, 
publishes an article by the director of the new college, from which the 
following excerpts are translated: 
The programmes, statutes, and schedules of the German-Chinese college at Tsingtau 
will shortly be published in both the Chinese and German languages. 
The college consists of two departments, a preparatory school and a school of science. 
The preparatory-school course extends over six years, taking young Chinese of at 
least 13 years of age. These students must have had a good Chinese education and 
be qualified for the lower classes of high schools. A certificate relative to his quali- 
fications must be submitted by the scholar seeking admittance, obtained after exam- 
ination before the Chinese examiner at Tsinan and the inspector of studies of the| 
college at T:ingtau, which examination is indispensable. Knowledge of the German] 
language and modern sciences is not required for the preparatory school, but if newl 
entering scholars have such knowledge they will be admitted to the higher classes, 
An examination will be held before graduation from the preparatory school, whic! 
must be passed in order to obtain admission into the higher—second department. 
THE SCHOOL OF SCIENCE. 
The school of science consists of two great divisions: (1) A department of law ani 
political science; and (2) a technical department, including natural history. Thi 
first department comprises the entire legal and state material, especially law; inter. 
national law; general state and administrative rights; state laws; railway, mining 
and maritime law; political economy; finances and comparative cases of real property, 
In addition the general outlines of a process or suit will be explained to the students 
as well as the task of police administration. 
There are laboratories for chemistry, physics, electricity, mineralogy, and geology] 
machine building, mining, etc. Students of the higher college are at liberty to choos 
their vocations, but must, however, strictly comply with the schedule. The studen: 
of the first term must remain at college for four years, but later discrimination wi 
be made when the students enter, according to their knowledge of the German la: 
guage, so that the courses will occupy.the following periods: Legal course, thre 
years; forestry, three years; building, two years; technical, four years. 
The philosophical course will be taught by Chinese teachers, a medical branch wi 
probably be opened after one year, and a subcourse will also be given in gymnastic 
music, and art. The minimum age for the school of science is 20 years, and a goo} 
knowledge of the preparatory courses is essential to admission. If a student wish 
to join the school of sciences without having visited the preparatory school, he mu 
first pass an examination in both Chinese and Western sciences, a good knowledge 
both the Chinese and German languages being necessary. 
TEACHERS, TUITION, BOARD, ETC. 
At present there will be employed at the college 12 German tutors and 10 Chine: 
teachers and interpreters, and as the number of students grows the staff will 
increased. Buildings and dormitories are sufficient for the present and are in the be} 
of condition. The fee for tuition in the preparatory school is 100 marks ($23.80), a: 
for the school of science 200 marks ($47.60) per annum. Board and lodging costs 
marks ($2.38) a month, so that altogether a preparatory-school student has to pa

including tuition, 220 marks ($52.36), and the higher students 320 marks ($76.16) 
annually. 
Application for admission is to be made to the director or the Chinese board of 
education at Tsinan. A translation office will be opened in conjunction with the 
college to prepare the necessary material. 
German-Chinese High School. 
Vice-Consul Edgar Kopp, of Tsingtau, reports that it is the inten- 
tion of the management of the German-Chinese High School at that 
place to open a free course of lectures on popular scientific sub- 
jects, illustrated with pictures and experiments, for the benefit of 
the foreign residents. Besides thesé lectures, an evening course in 
the Chinese language and script, as far as necessary for daily use, 
will be given for the benefit of the German community. Two Ger- 
man professors are to lecture. 
CHINESE MUSIC. 
Invention and character thereof, musical instruments, ete. 
In connection with his report on the foreign trade in musical 
instruments in China, Deputy Consul-General Clarence E. Gauss, of 
Shanghai, prepared the following paper on Chinese music: 
The Chinese claim for their music the greatest antiquity. Accord- 
ing to their annals, music was invented by the Emperor Fuhsi some 
three thousand years before the Christian era. At that time, how- 
ever, music was not regulated by any laws, nor were the instruments 
of a complicated kind. But under the Emperor Huangti, 2700 B. C., 
the art of music made important progress, a certain note was chosen 
as keynote, the sounds were fixed and received names, comparisons 
were drawn. between the notes and the celestial bodies of the universe 
and music became a necessity in the State, a key to good government. 
fter Huangti his successors took pride in practicing music and 
omposing hymns, and the post of music master was considered the 
ighest dignity in the Empire. 
Confucius spoke of music in the highest terms of sincere admira- 
ion, and recommended it as the best medium for governing and 
iding the passions of men. 
Chinese accounts describe ancient music as beautifully sweet and 
armonious, but they give no idea of what it was like. Tsin-shih- 
uangti, 246 B. C., ordered the destruction of all books, and as 
usic books and instruments were included, the tradition of music 
as lost. Subsequent emperors, especially Yuen Tsung, 720 A. D., 
nd Kangshi, 1721, made great efforts to revive music and bring it 
ack to its old splendor, but the discussions and contradictory 
jheories of various writers put the whole system into confusion, and 
aused the art of music to sink to the lowest rank.
-P-A-G-E-464
  
  456 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910, 
Character of music. 
Chinese music is written, like the language, in vertical rows of 
characters from right to left. The value of the notes or their length 
can not be ascertained, as rests, pauses, etc., are seldom indicated, and 
there is no division into bars. The Chinese use no chromatic scale, 
and they have nothing resembling our sharps, flats, etc.; that is, 
signs which in a piece of music sharpen or flatten certain notes. 
The best Chinese musician can only conjecture the general form of 
a written piece shown to him for the first time; to be able to decipher 
it he must hear it played. Therefore, all the tunes are learned by 
tradition, and are continually modified by the individual taste of the 
performer, so that after a lapse of time the tunes become quite differ- 
ent from what they were originally, and scarcely two musicians will 
be found to play exactly the same notes when performing the same 
piece of music. 
Chinese music is divided into two classes, ritual and popular, 
Under the name of ritual music must be comprehended all musi 
performed at court or at religious ceremonies. Under popula: 
music are grouped all theatrical, ballad, professional, and ordina: 
street-song music. Among a list of selections of Chinese music on 
programme I find one entitled ‘‘Ta-Pa-Pan”’ (“The Eight Boards’) 
supposed to emanate from the pen of the great Emperor Kanghsi, 
together with the following entitled selections: ‘‘Opening the Hand,’ 
“The Maid of the Green Willow,” ‘‘Mother Understands Me Well,’ 
“Alone at Home,” ‘‘Dame Wang,” ‘‘The Abode of Love,” “Th 
Widow’s Lament,” ‘‘Painting Fans,” ‘‘Breaking the Looking-glass,’ 
“Making Verses with a Bird,” ‘‘The Locust’s Fate,” ‘The Seal o 
Longevity,”’ ‘‘The Ladder of Happiness,” ‘‘The Happy Dream,’ 
“The Men who Fear Their Wives,” ‘‘The Crockery mender.”     
   
   
                 
   
    
        
        
        
    
   
    
   Chinese musical instruments. 
A paper entitled ‘‘A List of the Musical and other Sound-Produ 
ing Instruments of the Chinese,” by A. C. Moule, B. A., Trinit; 
College, Cambridge, has recently been published by the North Chin| 
Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in their journal for 1908. T! 
author groups the instruments into three classes—sonorous su 
stances, vibrating membranes, and wind instruments, and describ 
a vast collection of ancient and present-day instruments, includin| 
all styles of drums, tambourines, hoop drums, hand drums, rattl 
drums, war drums, etc.; clappers, rattles, castanets, gongs, bell 
flutes, whistles, bamboo pipes, pigeon whistles, whistling tops, re 
instruments, small hand organs, free-reed instruments, fiddle} 
conches, horns, and musical toys, many of them ancient, many 
them sacred to the use of the imperial family or religious state ce

   Foreign musical education of Chinese. 
While the missionary and the western educator have been busy 
preading Christianity and western learning among the Chinese, 
ome little time has also been given to the introduction of western 
usic. It is interesting to see the drum-and-fife corps, and some- 
‘imes even small bands, established in the modern educational insti- 
uutions of China. Even in the Chinese schools, where the missionary- 
ducated Chinese are rapidly being called as teachers, they are bring- 
with them the baby organ, to which they have become attached 
s students. 
At a recent graduation-day ceremony at Shanghai in a Chinese 
irls’ school conducted by American women. many of the invited 
ests were surprised at the ease and accuracy with which several 
oung Chinese girls played foreign musical selections on the violin 
d piano. According to a Shanghai dealer, the Japanese are being 
ployed in large numbers as music teachers in Chinese schools, and 
ey have had much to do with the inroad made by Japan in the 
usical-instrument trade in all lines. 
COLLEGE OF MEDICINE. 
Consul W. T. Gracey writes from Tsingtau that it is reported that 
cording to the wishes of Viceroy Chang Chitung a college of medi- 
e is about to be opened at the Chinese capital. Preliminary plans 
clude the following measures: 
As the school is to afford the highest medical training for the 
ung men of the entire Empire, it shall not employ men on its fac- 
ty who do not come with the highest possible recommendations. In 
cordance with Chinese ideas the course is to be divided into three 
ars of old Chinese medical practice and six years of modern west- 
training. At the end of these nine years there is to be a thorough 
amination and then three more years of study and trial practice 
all be demanded before the students shall be qualified doctors. This 
amination must also be passed by people who are now practicing 
certificates from existing medical schools. No one who does 
t hold a literary rank of a fixed grade (Chii yen) shall be allowed 
take these examinations, regardless of where he studied. Com- 
sation to be paid by the students who will study at this new school 
o be fixed at a future meeting of men appointed to have charge of 
institute.

Care of school children. 
Consul George H. Scidmore, of Nagasaki, in answer to an inquiry 
reports that a thorough physical examination of all school childre 
in Japan must be made by physicians in April each year, and 
monthly sanitary inspection, made by physicians also, of all scho 
buildings, their contents, water supply, surroundings, etc.; also 
monthly examination of pupils, but not so minute as the annual exa: 
inations. If a pupil is found to require medical treatment, the fa 
must be reported to the parents.     
    
       
    
     
   
        
     
     
   
    
   
    
   
    
    Proposed industrial school in Formosa. 
According to Consul S. C. Reat, of Tamsui, an industrial an 
mechanical training school will probably be established in Formo 
some time in 1910. It will probably be located in Taichu, a centr 
town in the island. The Japanese Government has delegated a nu 
ber of professors of the Tokyo Higher Industrial and Mechanic 
School to visit Formosa, and their recommendation will determi 
_ the action of the Government, but the consul adds that there is 
doubt that the industrial conditions warrant the erection and equi 
ment of such a school. 
Medical education and status of foreign physicians. 
In response to an American inquiry Consul George H. Scidmo. 
of Nagasaki, sends a report on medical schools and laws applyi 
to the practice of medicine in Japan, from which the following extra 
are taken: 
Medical colleges are located at Tokyo, Kioto, Fukuoka, Chi 
Sendai, Okayama, Kanazawa, Nagasaki, Aichi, and Kumamoto. Si 
dents are required to have from eleven to twelve years of work 
the elementary and middle schools before they are admitted to or 
nary medical colleges, and in case of admission to the medical colle; 
of Tokyo, Kioto, and Fukuoka universities, students are required 
pursue three additional years’ study in the higher schools. 
Graduates from the imperial universities and other approved m 
ical schools must secure a license from the minister of home aff 
before they begin to practice. A graduate of a foreign medi 
school or a holder of a physician’s license, coming from a coun 
that licenses Japanese physicians without examinations, may 
licensed by the minister of home affairs. No person may prac 
medicine who has been convicted of felony, who is deprived of ¢ 
rights, or who has been sentenced to imprisonment or fined in ¢: 
nection with medical practice. For ten years books must be kept 
physicians, and the names, ages, residence, professions, and the n 
of diseases of patients and the method of treatment applied to t 
must be entered therein. Physicians can not make a false adverti 
ment by boasting of their talents, nor can they advertise as havi 
secret method of treatment.

GENERAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 
In Austria the urgent necessity of increasing teachers’ salaries has 
rought the teachers of al] the different nationalities and religious 
nominations closer together, but the very popular demand that the 
perial, or federal, government ease the burden of the states (crown 
nds) by taking upon itself one-half of all the expenditures for 
ublic education does not seem to have much chance of realization 
the near future. In December, 1909, an order was issued to pro- 
ide all schools with hygienic inspectors or school physicians. A 
leginning in medical-school inspection was made in normal schvols, 
ut most of the elementary schools must wait until the means have 
en provided for~this service. The clerical party, which is very 
rong in Austria, is making efforts to bring the schools under ex- 
usively clerical supervision, but the teachers, basing their right to 
supervised by professional educators on the school law of 1869, 
hold the liberal spirit of the law and the practice of the last four 
cades, and express opposition to clerical rule in conventions and 
the press. The latest conflict took place in the city of Vienna, 
ere new emphasis was given to the idea of Empress Maria Theresa, 
e., that school is a “ politicum.” 
The problem of remodeling the high or secondary school courses 
Austria so as to satisfy the demands of modern life, instead of 
459 
 
-P-A-G-E-468
  460 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
preparing exclusively for universities (a problem which has long 
been solved in Germany by the establishment of Realgymnasia and 
Reformgymnasia), is now agitating municipal and provincial au- 
thorities as well as the Imperial Government. Public opinion has 
been aroused and attacks are made in the press and in parliament: 
on the study of Latin and Greek. It is the old combat between 
humanists and realists, which, however, will not result in doin 
away with philological studies in classical schools of Austria an 
more than in other countries, but rather in establishing new forms o 
schools which will pay due heed to the requirements of scientifi 
professions, such as agriculture and forestry, architecture, minin 
engineering, electrotechnology, and others. The acute stage of th 
conflict began in 1905 with the formation of a society for the pro 
tection of the interests of classical schools. At Easter, 1906, the Ge 
man Reformgymnasia were taken as models for schools of a moder: 
type. These schools have uniform lower grades and bi- or trifurcat| 
sections in the upper grades, thus allowing the students to sele 
their professions at a later age than formerly. In July, 190 
the minister of education set on foot an inquiry which was to de 
with the whole subject of secondary instruction, and in March, 190: 
new regulations for the graduation certificates were issued whic] 
affected the courses of all these schools, bringing them into conformi 
with modern life. 
In Germany there are a number of storm centers. In Bavaria, f 
instance, the Teachers’ Association, a branch of the National Ge} 
man Teachers’ Union, is combating the policy of clerical sch 
supervision. Their latest memorial demands that teachers be fre 
from the duty of performing lower church services (acting as se 
tons, beadles, etc.). The same motives are prompting the teachers 
Wurttemberg, where a new school law (see p. 450 of Annual Rep 
for 1909) has recently been passed, which introduces professio: 
supervision in the cities, but leaves the clericals to perform that du 
in rural districts. In Baden the Government is working out n 
school regulations made necessary by the law of 1906. The teach 
in this State are still awaiting an increase in their salaries, wh) 
professional supervision will, as it appears, be secured in the n 
future. The importance of this question may be seen from the f: 
that the state teachers’ meeting, held at Heidelberg and attended 
3,000 teachers of Baden, discussed the question for many hours, a 
almost unanimously passed strong resolutions in favor of such sup 
vision. In Saxony the revision of the school law is not yet complet 
Teachers and clergy are still discussing the scope and method of 
ligious instruction in school. In Prussia the new regulations of gi 
secondary schools (see p. 296 of the Annual Report for 1908) are ¢| 
ried out with all due deliberation and thoroughness, and the spirit

   that reform manifests itself in the increased attendance of young 
women who wish to prepare themselves for admission to higher 
institutions. A novel situation has developed in connection with the 
reorganization of girls’ high schools, namely, the lack of men teachers. 
The latter prefer appointments in boys’ schools, because it would be 
necessary for them to serve under women principals if they should 
accept appointments in girls’ schools. The new salary law (see p. 452 
of the Annual Report for 1909), though it has placed the Prussian 
teachers above those of nearly all other German States, is still un- 
satisfactory to them, since it is left to local authorities to determine 
the amount of rent indemnity to which teachers are entitled, and the 
amount proves to be inadequate, save in a few localities. 
In Prussia, as well as in other German States, the teachers of the 
lower schools are anxious to obtain the right to pursue university 
studies, claiming that graduation from the six years’ normal-school 
course is equal to that of the Oberrealschule. The only difference is 
the absence of foreign languages in the former, which, it is claimed, 
teachers do not need for the scientific branches they desire to study. 
The higher institutions of learning in Germany, the universities and 
polytechnica, experience an unusual increase in the number of stu- 
dents, but the professors do not always welcome the graduates of 
secondary schools because many of them are unfit, or waste their time 
during the first year of their courses. (See p. 491.) Perhaps the 
most important event in the history of public education in Germany 
of 1909-10 is the admission of the Teachers’ Association of Alsace- 
Lorraine to the German National Teachers’ Union. This is the key- 
stone, so to speak, in the arch of the latter union, which has now 
about 150,000 paying members. Since each one of the members is a 
voter and, as a rule, an adviser to the parents as well as to his pupils, 
ithe Teachers’ Union is a political asset, with which parties and Gov- 
lernment are in the nature of the case obliged to reckon. This new 
relation has not been made without violent opposition on the part of 
he clergy. The Catholic bishops of Strassburg and Metz warned the 
achers of Alsace-Lorraine not to join the National Union, but the 
overnor of the province took the bishops very sharply to task for 
nterfering with the teachers’ political and civil rights. 
In Switzerland, where the minimum salary of teachers is much less 
than in Prussia, and where their tenure of office is rather precarious, 
he teachers argue in the press and in public meetings that they 
should be placed on equal footing with local civil officers. The 
chweizerische Lehrerzeitung, in a review of the year, gives the fol- 
lowing items of local importance: In the canton (state) of Zurich 
ertain increases have been granted by popular vote in a few local 
istricts. A proposed bill for the reorganization of the continuation 
chool system is encountering some opposition in public, inasmuch as

    it makes higher claims upon local taxation. A law which fixes the 
amount of annuity for teachers’ widows and orphans was passed in 
1909. In the canton of Berne the technical school at Biel has been 
made a cantonal or state institution, and its somewhat antiquated 
graduation examination revised. The canton of Lucerne proposed a 
revision of its school law, which has passed the lower house. In the 
canton of Schwyz a revision of the school law was rejected by the 
referendum vote of the people. Uri has introduced new school regu- 
lations, and Nidwalden has established a pension fund for teachers. 
The canton of Glarus prepared a new school law which is so radical 
that the authorities, in order to save some good features of it, propose 
partial revision. In Solothurn, or Soleure, the annuity funds for 
teachers have been enlarged and the claims of annuitants increased. 
In Basel-Land the popular vote has rejected a new school law twice 
within a few years, and in Basel-City the organization of the schools 
has been subjected to severe criticism by the teachers; this is likely 
to lead to a revision of the law. The newly proposed bill attempts 
to amend the present regulations without serious changes of the fun- 
damental forms of the old law. In Schaffhausen, likewise, a revisio! 
of the cantonal school law is under advisement. In Appenzell a. Rh 
the popular vote has rejected the new school law for the fourth time. 
and in Thurgau, or Thurgovia, the teachers are urging an extensio 
of the normal-school course. St. Gall is preparing a new school law 
Aargau, or Argovia, has just succeeded in submitting a new law t 
the cantonal council. Graubiinden, or Grisons, is suffering from lac 
of teachers, owing to the very low salaries paid. In Tessin, o: 
Ticino, the school law passed by the legislature and rejected by refer; 
endum vote in 1908 has not been revived in amended form. Subjec 
to much political strife are the schools of the St. Gotthard Railroa 
which have become federal property through transfer of the railroa 
to the federal government. The schools of the canton of Wallis, o 
Valais, are in a transitory state, since the new school law, passed la 
year, requires changes which only time and patience can effect. 
revision of the law affecting the secondary schools has begun. I 
Neuchatel the former academy has been changed into a full-fledge 
university, and the primary school law has been revised. In t 
canton of Waadt, or Vaud, the new law for secondary schools is bein, 
carried out. The “mutualité scolaire” received a bad shock whe 
old-age insurance was adopted; hence the former will have to retur| 
to its original basis. Genf, or Geneva, celebrated the three hundr 
and fiftieth anniversary of its university in 1909, and passed a la 
concerning arts and industries which enables the authorities to esta 
lish a secondary technical school. The polytechnic institute 
Zurich has adopted a new study order and now grants the degree 
Dr. Ing. (doctor of engineering). :

EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 463 
An inquiry among the Danish teachers concerning professional or 
clerical school supervision had the following result: 
Question 1. Is it desirable that the rector or pastor of the parish 
supervise the schools?—Answer. Yes, 2,650 votes; nay, 700. 
Question 2. Shall the teaching profession be represented in the 
supervisory offices?—Answer. Yes, 3,079 votes; nay, 280. 
Question 3. Shall the church be represented in the supervision of 
schools?—Answer. Yes, 2,036; nay, 1,195. 
Question 4. Is it desirable to retain instruction in religion in the 
schools ?—Answer. Yes, 2,993 votes; nay, 377. 
This shows that the teachers of Denmark are agitated by the same 
ideas at present discussed in Germany and Austria. 
Thus we see in the organization and legal foundation of all the 
States of central Europe new features, increased motion, and adapta- 
tion to modern life—nowhere a standstill. Faster than ever the inner 
development of public education proceeds, and both the method and 
course of instruction are revised to produce men and women who 
can find their way through the multiplicity of demands arising from 
the complexity of modern life. The more changes are made in pro- 
ductive labor the stronger are the attacks on the old-time school and 
the higher is school reform valued. Everywhere, from the sea to 
the Alps, there is a noticeable educational unrest, which results in 
throwing overboard all antiquated methods, tottering institutions, 
and unnatural limitations. Luther’s contemporary, Ulrich von Hut- 
ten, said at the beginning of the sixteenth century: “It is a joy to 
live now.” This word may well be applied to the life and the scho- 
lastic preparatory institutions in central Europe at the beginning of 
the twentieth century. 
     
                                               
        
   
           
    
   
    
   GERMAN ASSOCIATION FOR SCHOOL REFORM. 
In the fall of 1908, and again in 1909, a small number of men and 
omen from various parts of the Empire came together in Berlin to 
iscuss ways and means to change the entire system of public educa- 
ion from within. These gatherings recruited themselves especially 
rom the ranks of teachers of elementary schools, and formed the 
ssociation for School Reform, which for nearly two years worked 
ithout calling the public press to aid them. The association took 
he Association for Reform of Industrial Art as a model, which, 
ided by a score of prominent artists, has done much to revive 
dustrial styles and forms of the middle ages and to improve the 
roducts of building trades, decorators, furniture makers, bookbind- 
rs, and other trades. The Association for School Reform (central 
fice in Hamburg) wishes to avoid bureaucratic regulations, and in- 
nds to appeal to school and family alike, in order to establish a closer   
 
-P-A-G-E-472
  464 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
connection between the educative work of school and home and modern 
cultural life, that is, with the civilization of our time. The efforts of 
the association have been directed to the physical and psychical de- 
velopment of youth, and it avoids exclusively professional discussions 
by drawing into its sphere of labor laymen and women deeply inter- 
ested in school reform. Early in March, 1910, the association issued 
invitations for a public meeting, at which Professor Meumann, of 
Halle, made an address, setting forth the aims of the association, whose 
activity is to be part of the large international pedagogical attempt 
at school reform, which aims at adapting school to modern civiliza- 
tion. To reach this aim, he urged, there were three obstacles to over- 
come: (1) The historic foundation of the present German school 
system; (2) the traditional methods of organization and methods o 
teaching; (3) antiquated laws and the want of adequate modern| 
legislation. The reform of the schools, by adapting them to the de 
mands of modern times, might be attempted from three standpoints 
Science, practical life, and culture, both ethical and esthetic. Th 
speaker, in his address, touched upon the often discussed sciences. 
pedagogy, hygiene, and psychology. Doctor Kéhne, of Berlin, dwel 
upon the pedagogical interest of judges on the bench, and pleaded fo 
the better preparation of judges and a better comprehension of juve 
nile character. Doctor Stern, of Breslau, spoke of the intimate rela 
tion of child study to general culture, and urged the establishment o 
a central office for child study, the questionnaires of which would b 
authoritative for the whole of Germany. Doctor Wetekamp spok 
of optional studies in secondary schools, and Doctor Weygand, o| 
Hamburg, about the participation of the physician in all matte 
of education. The association seems to have all the necessary qual 
fications of successful activity, since it is led by men of profoun 
learning and has a very enthusiastic membership, consisting of teac 
ers and laymen. As means are placed at the disposal of the associ 
tion, it will support every attempt at school reform worthy of i 
attention, and thus gradually draw into cooperative action all el 
ments in sympathy with its object. 
      
      
     
       
    
        
         
        
   
   
   
   
    MATERIAL PROGRESS OF THE PRUSSIAN SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
The Sozial-Statistische Correspondenz (Berlin) reports that in t 
28 large cities of Prussia (cities of over 100,000 inhabitants) the i 
crease in the number of elementary schools amounted to 9,694 with’ 
the last twenty years. This is owing not only to the increase 
population, but partly to the efforts made by the school authoriti 
to reduce the number of pupils for each teacher. The city of Ch: 
lottenburg (sister city to Berlin) has gone furthest in this refor’ 
for the maximum number of elementary pupils per class in that ci

    is 45. The increase in local expenditures for the lower schools dur- 
ing the last twenty years has been very large. Without counting the 
expenditures for teachers’ pensions and other items, which are borne 
by the State exclusively, the 28 large cities of the Kingdom, the local 
school budget of which was $6,281,432 twenty years ago, now (that is, 
in 1909) pay $18,394,782. This is the result of local taxation only, 
state and provincial governments paying a considerable amount for 
the support of the lower schools. (See p. 447 of the Annual Report 
for 1909.) The largest local lower-school budget is, of course, found 
in Berlin, namely, $5,804,699; the smallest in Wiesbaden, $198,645. 
The per capita of local expenditures for the lower schools rose from 
$4.70 to $19.99 in Charlottenburg and $32.13 in Frankfort on the 
(Main. The city of Halle has the lowest per capita local school ex- 
penditure, viz, $13.28. 
SCHOOL HYGIENE IN GERMANY. 
“Education without health is useless” is a statement of an Amer- 
ican author made in discussing the necessity of promoting practical 
chool hygiene. This idea, called forth by the social misery demon- 
trated by the physical condition of school children, leads more and 
ore to the recognition of the necessity of employing physicians 
ide by side with teachers in schools. In No. 6 of Zeitschrift fiir das 
rmenwesen (1909) Dr. Alfred Lewandowski (Berlin) gives a re- 
jew of the attempts toward improving the physical conditions of 
chool children in Germany. Though there seems much left to be 
one, a promising beginning has been made during the last decade. 
In the summer of 1908 the central committee for “ Jugendfiir- 
orge” (care of children criminally inclined or merely neglected) 
ent out a set of questions to the governments of all German cities 
ith a population of over 10,000. Of 524 of such communities 90 
er cent replied. Of 468 localities, the population of which amounted 
21,503,976, and which had 3,023,133 pupils in 4,567 graded ele- 
entary schools, with 160,026 classes, there were found school physi- 
ians in 266; hence 202 cities had not yet resorted to the introduction 
f school physicians. Since 1908 the latter number has been greatly 
leduced. 
Gymnastic exercises in the open air, during recesses and after 
hool hours, were held in the lower schools of 193 cities, while the 
ions were interrupted by calisthenic exercises in the schools of 
6 cities and breathing exercises by open windows in the schools of 
0 cities. Orthopedic gymnastics for children suffering from curva- 
re of the spine are arranged in 22 cities. In 205 cities the school 
thorities offer opportunities for swimming baths in pools with 
mstantly changing water; in 95 of these cities the city government

attends to the cleanliness of pupils in the municipal bathing institu- 
tions; in 216 cities the schoolhouses have shower baths in the base- 
ments. 
Gymnastic school excursions on free afternoons (Wednesdays and| 
Saturdays) are made in 163 cities; games for children in the open| 
air on playgrounds and in neighboring groves are arranged in 357] 
cities; and in 382 the teachers are obliged to take their classes ou 
walking through woods and fields. Four cities have arranged row 
ing matches; skating on ice is promoted in 174 cities; 226 cities hav: 
play afternoons as regular school lessons. In 36 cities forest sani 
tariums are maintained, 3 have forest homes for sickly children, and 
have forest schools. 
In 1908 as many as 448 cities offered instruction in the uppe 
grades of school on the evil effects of alcohol. In 20 cities schoo 
dental clinics are established, and in 15 other cities such clinics wer 
planned, the authorities merely waiting for the required appropria 
tion; 53 cities attend in other ways to the teeth of their school chil 
dren; and in 163 an examination of the children’s teeth takes plac 
at regular stated intervals. In 274 cities a careful examination o 
children’s eyes is made at intervals, and records are kept; thre 
cities have appointed professional oculists for that purpose; an 
215 furnish glasses at the city’s expense. For children with defectiv 
hearing 181 cities have appointed experts, but only 24 have arrange 
special schools for such children. 
In 196 cities courses of instruction for teachers for curing defect 
of speech are arranged; in 171 cities special treatment of throat an 
nose diseases and for children suffering from impediments in thej 
speech is arranged. Also for children of nervous troubles and fc 
weak-minded children, 103 auxiliary classes in fully graded schoo 
and 169 independent auxiliary schools are established. In 238 coi 
munities special physicians are appointed to determine the existen: 
of tuberculosis among the school children; 109 cities merely exclu 
such children from attendance at school; in 139 other cities su 
children are sent to appropriate institutions at the city’s expense. 
This brief review shows what schools can do in a practical way 
the field of hygiene. From the replies received it is seen that valu 
ble experiments are made everywhere, partly in saving sick a 
weak children and partly in preventing contagion and infectio 
which might be a menace to the healthy. Physical health deser 
fully as much attention in school as do mental and moral heal: 
The question of organizing the department of physical develo 
ment and health, so as to do the most good without seriously in 
fering with the intellectual school work, is of great importance.

    To all the efforts mentioned in the foregoing may be added the duty 
f feeding hungry children, which is done in 201 cities. (See stat- 
stics following.) This is not done in Germany from charitable 
otives; free breakfasts or lunches are not given or taken as alms, 
ut the whole movement is prompted by pedagogical motives, since 
struction to hungry children is about as useless as it is to sick 
hildren. It may be stated that the appointment of school physicians 
to-day (February, 1910) almost universal in Germany, and that in 
lonsequence of the work of these men, as well as of school nurses, new 
eas have been developed, and improvements have been introduced, 
that the foregoing report, nearly a year and a half old, is in some 
f its statements already antiquated.

ATTENDANCE AND PROMOTIONS IN THE SCHOOLS OF BERLIN. 
The annual report of 1908-9 of the school authorities of Berlin 
tains some interesting statements concerning attendance, grading, 
id promotion of pupils in the elementary or Volks-schools. The 
tailed statistics may be omitted here and only totals quoted; more- 
ler, the report gives relative figures, which for purposes of com- 
rison are more useful.

The per cent of those who graduated from the highest or eigh 
grade at the close of the two semesters was 88.4 per cent in 1908; 
1907 it was 88.57 per cent, in 1905 it was 88.02 per cent, and in 19
-P-A-G-E-477

it was 87.10 per cent, there being two promotions a year. If we add 
the pupils who were permitted to leave school before reaching the 
eighth grade, having proved by an examination to the satisfaction 
of the supervisory authorities that they were competent, namely, 
1,858 in number, those who completed the prescribed course may be 
said to have been 90 per cent. 
Among American readers the question may arise, How is it that 
so many children in Berlin are withdrawn from school, the compul- 
sory attendance act covering the ages of 6 to 14? The report answers 
that question by stating that 18,909 children reported to have with- 
drawn were merely transferred to other schools, the families having 
moved into other districts; 10,361 moved into the suburbs, the schools 
of which are not governed by the Berlin school board; 2,234 left the 
lower schools to enter the various secondary schools at 9 or 10 years 
of age; 556 children died; and 243 were assigned to reform schools 
or special schools. 
The per cent of pupils promoted to the next higher grade at Easter 
and in the fall is stated to have been as follows:

TEACHERS’ SICK LEAVE IN BERLIN. 
The Berlin school board published recently a statistical report of 
he cases of sick leave granted to the teachers of the elementary 
hools of that city in the school year 1908-9. Cases of sick leave of 
rom one to three days are not taken-into consideration, since they 
ere granted by the principals of the building. The following five 
bles (taken from the Piidagogische Zeitung of Berlin, December 9) 
re of great interest, since they offer material for comparison:

    The school authorities have gathered and published these data only 
during the last three years. A comparison of the facts of the last 
three years, however, is instructive, inasmuch as it reveals a dispro- 
portionate amount of time spent in sick leave by the women teachers, 
for more than one-half of all the women teachers of Berlin were ill 
more than three days in 1908-9, namely, an average of 30.75 days 
each; while the average days of illness of only one-fourth of the men 
teachers was only 28.92 days each. Here are the results of the three 
annual reports in relative figures:

From the city of Magdeburg in the Prussian province of Saxony 
imilar statistical results are reported. During the scholastic year 
908-9 the number of men teachers who were ill longer than three 
ays was 137 in a total of 665. The number of cases of illness was 176 
nd the total number of days of absence 4,735. Among the 102 women 
leachers 32 were ill in 44 cases, and the time lost was 1,012 days; hence

the per cent of absence on account of sickness among the men was 
26.9, among the women 43.1. During the year mentioned the average 
absence of men was 7.1 days, of women 9.9 days. The causes reported 
oftenest were diseases of the respiratory organs—2,057 days of the 
men, 417 days of the women; 799 days are credited to diseases of the 
digestive organs (men) ; 617 days to disorder of the nervous system 
(men); and 375 days to rheumatism (men). Women teachers lost 
347 days through disorder of the nervous system. 
In the Kingdom of Saxony a similar record was kept of 633 women 
teachers during the school year 1908-9. The result is as follows: 
Per cent. 
368 were not sick at all. 
110 were sick from 1 to 3 days_ 
71 were sick from 4 to 10 days___ 
26 were sick from 11 to 20 days_. 
12 were sick from 21 to 30 days_ 
18 were sick from 31 to 40 days. 
18 were sick from 41 to 100 days. 
13 were sick from 101 to 200 days__ 
2 were sick from 201 days to 1 year____ 
YOUNG TEACHERS IN PRUSSIAN RURAL SCHOOLS. 
Judge Von Campe, member of the Prussian House of Deputies, dis 
cusses in the “ Preussische Jahrbiicher ” (October, 1909) the relativ 
age of elementary teachers in cities and in rural districts, and offer: 
the result of his comparative study of the latest governmental schoo! 
census (1906) in tables which are illustrative of the conditions pre 
vailing in the Kingdom of Prussia. But since the circumstance: 
which draw teachers to the cities and often away from the professio1 
in ever-increasing numbers are the same in nearly all the other 2: 
States of the German Empire, the tables may be regarded as indica 
tive of the conditions of the whole of Germany. 
In order to understand the author’s statements and the deduction| 
he draws from the numbers, it should be explained that when hj 
speaks of 2,754 vacant teachers’ positions in 1906 he does not mea: 
to say that these positions were not filled or that the children in suc! 
places were left without schooling. It does mean that those positio 
were not definitely but only temporarily filled by “ aspirants,” or b 
normal-school graduates who had not passed ‘their “ repetition e 
amination,” or by women of private normal schools lacking gover: 
mental approbation. 
The author thinks the complaints that too many young teachers a 
employed in rural districts, where older and more experienced teac'! 
ers are more necessary than in graded city schools, and that rur:
-P-A-G-E-481
  
EDUCATION IN CENTRAL EUROPE. 473 
eachers are “ fleeing ” to the cities are well founded. The govern- 
ental reports and statistics corroborate this statement. 
          
   
   
    
    
     
        
       
      
   
    
     
     
       
       
      
     The total number of Prussian elementary teachers in 1906 was 102,764 (in 
908, 108,761). Of these, 43,604 taught in graded city schools, 59,160 in rural 
istricts. These totals include 2,754 positions which are only temporarily filled, 
r, according to the letter of the law, are vacant. Deducting from the totals also 
7,784 women teachers (namely, 11,860 in cities and 5,924 in rural districts), 
$ well as the 2,754 not definitely appointed, leaves 82,226 men teachers, namely, 
1,033 in cities and 51,193 in the country, which is, briefly stated, a proportion 
f 8 to 5. The proportion of women teachers in cities and the country is 2 to 1, 
The author then ascertains the ages of these teachers, as stated in 
he accompanying tables, as well as the ages of the women teachers 
see table), arranging the latter conveniently in three groups. Ap- 
lying the ratio of 8 to 5 for men teachers and 2 to 1 for women 
eachers, he ascertains the greater or smaller proportion of classified 
umbers which should be teaching in country schools or city schools, 
lespectively, if their ages were in the same proportion. The author’s 
lables, which are here reproduced, were used in the parliamentary 
mmission on public education during the protracted discussion on 
e salary law. (See Annual Report of Commissioner of Education, 
909, p. 452.) 
Considering that for every three men teachers in cities there are five in rural 
hools and for every two women teachers in cities there is only one in rural 
‘hools, it is seen that the recent increase in the number of women teachers 
Prussia is chiefly found in cities, where men can find more lucrative employ- 
lent than ‘teaching, and that the positions thus vacated are taken by women. 
e latter being mostly city born, are not apt to apply for places in remote 
lages. 
In regard to the ages of the teachers, the author concludes that in 
untry schools almost every fourth man teacher and almost every 
ird woman teacher is less than 25 years old. In country schools 
most exactly every fourth teacher, regardless of sex, has not yet 
en 4 years in service, while, according to the average for city 
d country, about every sixth or seventh teacher should belong to 
at category. In cities, on the other hand, only every sixteenth — 
cher belongs to that category. Expressed in absolute figures, rural 
tricts have a surplus of 4,135 young men and 760 young women, or 
jout 4,900 young teachers more than they should have, according to 
proportion indicated in the foregoing as well as in the tables, 
d the author is of the opinion that this is not a satisfactory condi- 
nm. In parliament and in the press Professor Von Campe’s opinion 
s stanchly upheld.

    A GERMAN NORMAL SCHOOL COURSE. 
   ince the teachers of the lower schools in Germany have of late 
m petitioning the state authorities in several States for admission 
he universities it has become necessary to prove that a German 
mal-school education is equivalent to the education offered in sec- 
ary or preparatory schools. “An examination of the course of study 
he normal schoo] in Liibeck may show how such a claim is sup- 
ted. That school takes its students at the age of 15 from the city 
telschule, an institution equal to the Prussian middle schools or

    The number of students in the 183 normal schools of the Kingdom 
of Prussia reached 18,000, in 1909, while in the year previous it was 
17,500. This increase is owing to the opening of new normal and 
preparatory schools and the passage of the new salary law, which 
opens to teachers a better prospect for an adequate income than 
formerly. In consequence of the greater number of candidates pre- 
pared for the profession, the number of vacancies, which in 1901 was 
still 1,862, had decreased in 1908 to 1,345, though the number of posi- 
tions increased from 90,208 to 108,761 during the same period. The 
term vacancies is not to be taken literally, since many of them are 
temporarily filled by candidates, who have not passed their examina- 
tions. The Government is making efforts to supply the demand for 
teachers by arranging special normal courses for students of public 
and private secondary schools, aside from the regular 3 and 6 years 
ormal school courses. 
The curriculum of state normal schools is so arranged as to prepare 
he students for the modern demands of industrial life, in order that 
he graduates of normal schools can act as teachers of continuation 
chools, general or vocational, as they may be. The prevalent custom 
is, not to employ, if it can possibly be avoided, skilled artisans for 
ocational work in continuation schools, since it is deemed best to 
eep the further education of youth in the hands of pedagogically 
repared teachers. Artisans are apt to give too much attention to 
ere manual skill and tool work, and to neglect general or cultural 
udies. 
The following passage from the speech of Emperor Wilhelm, as 
ing of Prussia, at the opening of the winter session of the state 
gislature, is significant for the development of continuation schools: 
The care for youth who have passed the age of compulsory school attendance 
14 years) requires a further extension and development of the continuation 
hools, not only in the cities but also in agricultural districts. Based upon 
@ beneficial results of a law passed in 1904 for the Province of Hesse-Nassau 
d other provinces, my Government is preparing similar enactments for the 
rovinces of Pomerania, Silesia, and Westphalia, which will give the local 
vernments the right to decree compulsory attendance at continuation schools, 
they see fit to do so. 
MIDDLE SCHOOLS IN PRUSSIA. 
The term Mittelschulen, as used in Prussia, needs a definition. In 
ustria, Switzerland, and some southern German States the term 
applied to schools which prepare for higher institutions, i. e., 
r universities, polytechnica, etc., hence in these countries the term 
synonymous with high schools, academies, or secondary schools, 
used in the United States. In Prussia the Mittelschulen are some-  
-P-A-G-E-486
  478 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
thing different from preparatory schools for higher education. 
They are merely advanced elementary city schools, closely’ connected 
with the lower schools, but not at all related to secondary schools, 
that is, not leading up to them. They are intended to accommo- 
date the sons and daughters of artisans, small merchants, shop 
owners, and the lower civil officeholders, who aim at a simpler and 
more immediately useful education than is offered in secondary 
schools, the graduates of which go to higher institutions. The real 
nature of these middle schools may be characterized by calling them 
advanced city schools, for, in fact, they can be found only in cities, 
where there are children enough to fill a middle school. Their 
students are, as it were, the result of natural selection, the more 
talented and ambitious young people, whose parents can afford to 
keep them a year longer under tuition than the majority. 
These middle schools have recently (March, 1910) been reorgan- 
ized by ministerial order, which provides (1) that they shall increas 
the number of compulsory grades from eight to nine, the lowes 
three, or even five, grades being parallel to the same grades in ordi 
nary elementary schools; (2) that the local authorities may establis| 
them without the three lowest grades, drawing the pupils from othe 
primary schools, as high schools do; (3) that there is no objectio: 
to changing secondary schools without Latin (so-called Realschulen 
into middle schools, if the local authorities so desire; (4) that i 
all middle schools tuition fees may be charged, while the eigh' 
years’ elementary schools remain gratuitous; (5) that as a rule mid 
dle schools shall not be coeducational, but that for boys and girl; 
separate middle schools shall be established as soon as the numbe; 
of pupils permits; (6) that the three upper classes in middle school] 
shall in no case have more than 45 students, the lower may hay 
as high as 50; (7) that women may be appointed as principals 
girls’ middle schools; (8) that in small communities middle schoo 
may prepare to assume the character of secondary schools if the} 
teach Latin and possibly Greek. 
These schools teach the usual elementary branches and in additi 
offer elementary instruction in French and English, natural scienc 
mathematics, bookkeeping, shop and garden work. In girls’ schoo 
woman’s handiwork is substituted for boys’ shop work. As a matt 
of course, these advanced branches, foreign languages, mathemati 
and science, can not be taught to the same extent as is done in se 
ondary schools, but they are taught with a view toward immedia 
application in business. Each school adapts itself to the peculii 
demands of local conditions, some towns being more commerci 
others more industrial, still others exclusively agricultural. In ord| 
that these schools may meet local needs, the prescribed courses

made elastic, due heed being given, also, to the different requirements 
of the two sexes. 
In order to induce small communities to aim at the establishment 
of secondary schools, they are given permission to organize a middle 
school, which may be changed, in future, into a classical or semi- 
classical high school, i. e., into a Gymnasium or Realgymnasium. 
uch middle schools must teach the beginning of Latin and Greek, 
esides French and English. In cities where there are not enough 
udents to organize the entire nine years’ course (6 to 15), two 
rades may be combined. 
Middle, or advanced elementary, schools have been in existence for 
any years in Prussia, but in the statistical summaries of the state 
uthorities they were always classed among the lower schools. Now 
he ministerial order recognizes them as a separate type of schools 
tween elementary and secondary schools, hence their name. They 
eet distinct needs in large city populations, and are an expression 
f the tendency prevailing in Germany of segregating the social 
lasses. Thus we find the Volks or elementary schools (6 to 14 years), 
lhe middle schools (6 to 15 years), the modern or realistic schools 
ithout Latin, called Realschulen (6 to 17 years), the classical high 
hools, Gymnasia (6 to 19 or 20 years), the semiclassical high schools, 
ealgymnasia (6 to 19 or 20 years), and the upper realistic high 
hools, Oberrealschulen (6 to 19 or 20 years). 
In the United States the customary high school tries to meet the 
larious demands by offering a variety of courses, the classical, com- 
ercial, scientific, and technical courses, but in Germany the authori- 
es entertain the opinion that it is better to establish separate high 
hools. To a certain extent this is done in this country, as shown by 
e separate technical and commercial high schools in large cities. 
he Prussian middle schools are simply adding one more opportunity 
talented and ambitious students to rise above the dead mediocrity 
elementary education. They give their students an opportunity 
extend and round out their elementary education, and offer them 
owledge in a form which is practical and immediately applicable 
business and shop, in office and factory while they act as appren- 
es. Thus, for instance, the students intending to enter com- 
reial pursuits study commercial arithmetic, short-cuts, commercial 
ography, bookkeeping, and business methods; even history is per- 
ated, as it were, with references to commercial tendencies and 
ages. The needs of the boys who aim at skilled labor in shops and 
tories are met, especially in the methods in which drafting, sketch- 
, and manual work are taught. And the needs of girls are con- 
ered to a large extent. These middle schools appeal to pupils 
elementary schools who can not afford to enter high schools, the 
tion fees being too high and the courses too long.

SECONDARY SCHOOLS FOR BOYS IN PRUSSIA. 
Kunze’s Calendar of the secondary schools in Prussia, which 
closed its lists in May, 1909, states that the number of public high 
schools for boys increased during the previous year by the establish 
ment of 12 new schools; the actual increase in the number of ney 
schools was 13, but one old school was merged with another. Amon, 
the new institutions were 2 Gymnasia, 3 Reformgymnasia, 2 Real| 
gymnasia, and 6 Realschulen; hence there were among the 13 ne 
schools 9 which have no Latin in the three or four lower grades or n 
Latin at all. 
During the last nine years there have been established 147 new se 
ondary schools for boys. Of these, 69 were Realschulen or Obe 
realschulen, or modern high schools without Latin and Greek ( 
per cent) ; 26 were Gymnasia, or classical high schools (18 per cent 
and 52 were Realgymnasia, or semiclassical high schools (35 p 
cent). Nevertheless, the classical schools still have the majorit: 
namely, 364 institutions among 711, or 51 per cent. If we count t 
complete institutions only, eliminating those which lack the upp 
grades—in other words, considering only those the graduates 
which may enter the university—we find that of a total number 
468 there are 324, or 69 per cent, Gymnasia; 85, or 18 per cent, Re: 
gymnasia, and 58, or 13 per cent, Oberrealschulen. From this 
follows that the proportion of university students who have had 
classical preparatory education far exceeds the proportion of th 
who have a semiclassical or exclusively scientific education. T 
was plainly shown in an article in the Annual Report of 1909 ( 
p. 493), where the proportion of freshmen of classical education 
stated to have been 77 per cent; those of semiclassical education, 
per cent; and scientific education, 14 per cent. 
The teachers and principals of secondary schools in Prussia h 
repeatedly called the attention of the central state authorities to 
desirability of creating new schools rather than accumulating 
students in large schools. Five hundred students in ten grades, t 
claim, should be the limit. The calendar quoted shows how far t 
pedagogically desirable limitation is acknowledged by the authorit 
Of 711 high schools in Prussia, 85 had from 500 to 600 students; 
had between 600 and 700; 1 had 884, and 1, 926 students; while 
had less than 500 students.

COEDUCATION IN PRUSSIA. 
During a lengthy discussion of the budget for education in the 
russian Diet in May, 1910, coeducation came in for more attention 
an is usual in that body. Doctor Maurer, a national liberal mem- 
ler, urged its adoption in secondary schools as an expedient, saying: 
Since only one-half of the women of the nation are married, every father must 
anxious to provide his daughters with a good education for the struggle that 
waits them in life. That can not be done except by opening the boys’ high 
hools for girls also. I do not advocate coeducation as a remedy for evils, but 
ould suggest it as an expedient in small towns, in which it is literally impos- 
ble to maintain separate high schools for the two sexes. A separation may 
ke place as soon as the available means and the number of students warrant 
| It is a mere experiment I advocate. Prussia might utilize the experiences 
other States of the Empire. 
Minister of Education Doctor Von Trott zu Solz replied: 
Now that the reform of girls’ high schools, upon the basis of the recently 
ued regulations, has begun, it would seem best to patiently wait for the 
sults from the application of these regulations. We shall see whether the 
gulations have hit the right solutions of vexing problems or not. We should 
ait results, not in stagnation, but in quiet, steady work. [Applause.] To 
le women I address the warning not now to advance criticism and urge amend-

ments, but to join in the vigorous execution of the new regulations, and whe 
the time is ripe for a change to present proposals for amending the regulation 
The question of coeducation in secondary schools has been rejected on principl 
because the Government is of the opinion that the intended reform of girl 
education can better be effected in separate institutions, in which the individ 
ality of the girls can be taken into consideration. It is extraordinarily difficu 
to depart from that principle. I acknowledge that in strictly carrying it ou 
some hardship is felt here and there, but that can not be helped. I maintai 
the ground that no exception should be made from the rule which requir 
separation of the sexes in secondary institutions. To adopt coeducation wou! 
open up a number of new problems; for instance, that of the composition of tl 
teaching staffs of boys’ schools. 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND MILITARY SERVICE. 
The latest publication dealing with sanitary conditions in tl 
Prussian army and recounting the number of students of secondar 
schools fit for military service in the various army centers of tl 
Kingdom gives very detailed information, from which the importar 
fact stands forth that only about two-thirds of the students ai 
found physically fit to be drafted into the army or navy. The re: 
sons are thought to be found in the almost exclusive mental work i 
the class room and at home‘and the neglect of physical exercises i 
the form of gymnastics or outdoor sports. The following are of 
cial figures: 
During the last year the proportion of recruits who passed the 
school examination entitling them to the privilege of only one year 
service, being found physically fit, was 62.2 per cent of those comin 
from classical high schools (Gymnasia), 64.4 per cent of those con 
ing from semiclassical (Realgymnasia), and 67.7 per cent of tho 
coming from modern high schools (Oberrealschulen). Hence mo 
than one-third of those who were called to undergo the physic 
examination were found unfit to enter the army or navy. It 
true that this examination of so-called one-year volunteers is rath 
rigorous, since reserve officers are commissioned or selected fr 
these volunteers, but that does not explain away the large proporti 
of those found unfit. The proportion of normal-school gradua’ 
found perfect in health and stature was 78.1 per cent. 
The proportion of the unfit was even greater when weakness 
defects of sight and hearing were considered; much more than o 
half were found to fall short of the required standard. The p 
portion of those accepted was 47.8 per cent coming from classic 
44.4 per cent coming from semiclassical, and 39.6 per cent comi 
from Oberrealschulen, while the proportion of normal school gr: 
uates was 79.8 per cent. That exclusive occupation with the prin 
page has a baneful effect upon the health of students has alw 
been known, but the figures offered show conclusively the great 
tent to which this is true.

        The foregoing has reference only to students of secondary schools. 
Quite a different aspect of the question is noticed when the annual 
draft of recruits coming from Volksschulen (elementary or people’s 
chools) is considered. Nearly 90 per cent of these are fit for serv- 
lice, and some of the remaining 10 per cent are declared unfit merely 
because they have not the required height, but are otherwise healthy. 
he appalling condition of recruits from secondary schools has led 
a thorough shaking up of curricula, methods of teaching, and 
chool management in such schools in Prussia. 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN HUNGARY. 
Of the 16,561 elementary or people’s schools in Hungary, 2,046 are 
tate schools, 1,473 communal schools, 12,734 denominational schools, 
7 are supported by societies, and 271 are private schools. From the 
ourth grade children may leave to enter high schools, either classical 
Gymnasia) or modern high schools (Realschulen). The compul- 
lory-attendance law requires school attendance between the sixth and 
e fifteenth year of life. Up to the completed twelfth year, the 
hildren are required to attend the regular day schools; from the 
elfth to the fifteenth year they are required to attend either the

ree grades each. The state schools have been gratuitous since Sep- 
mber 1, 1909; children in communal and denominational schools 
ill be free from paying tuition fees after September 1, 1910. Many 
upils pay 50 hellers matriculation fee, which is used exclusively for 
maintenance of pupils’ and teachers’ libraries. Of the 2,595 
indergartens, 582 are maintained by the State, 1,403 by communi- 
les, 338 by denominational congregations, and 272 by private enter- 
ise, supported in part by communities or religious congregations. 
Aside from the repetition or continuation schools, there are obliga- 
ry vocational evening schools for trade and business apprentices; 
tendance at such schools is obligatory for the entire period of ap- 
enticeship. There are in large cities also other vocational schools

The course of instruction provides three grades for day schools, 
lower, middle, and upper grade, each lasting two years. In the 
per grade the pupils have 28 hours’ instruction per week, in the

mentary branches, religion, female handiwork, gymnastics, and games 
in all the grades. Civics is taught to boys in the upper grades, o: 
fifth and sixth year, while the girls are taught domestic economy. 
Teachers are not allowed to accept employment after school hours 
and can edit political journals only with the permission of the super: 
visory authorities. If a teacher is elected a member of Parliament. 
he is obliged to resign as teacher. He is subject to disciplina: 
punishment, if he agitates publicly against classes, nationalities| 
religious confessions, property, and marriage, or if he attempts t 
agitate for division of private and communal property. After te: 
years’ service a teacher may be pensioned with 40 per cent of hi 
salary; every additional year of service entitles him to 2 per cen 
more, until he reaches 100 per cent after 40 years’ service. Th 
teacher’s widow receives 50 per cent of her husband’s salary, if th 
latter does not exceed 1,200 crowns ($240) ; 20 per cent more of an 
salary over that amount. Each teacher’s half-orphan receives on 
fifth of the widow’s pension up to the sixteenth year of life; orphan 
both of whose parents are dead, receive double the amount. All th] 
teachers, men and women, as well as the principals, are required t 
serve 35 hours a week in school. 
       
     
      
     
   
     
     
   
       
   
    
              
    
     
   
     COEDUCATION IN AUSTRIAN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS, 
A new order, issued by the Austrian minister of public work 
opens to girls all industrial schools in Austria. After an introdu 
tion, in which the minister recognizes the ever-increasing necessity 
giving women a more suitable vocational and professional educatio: 
the order reads: 
These considerations prompt me to order that all state industrial schools, 
well as the industrial continuation schools without exception, be opened 
girls, beginning with the scholastic year 1910-11, and that the admission 
girls take place under the same conditions and under the same requirements 
present in effect for boys. 
‘The instruction is to be coeducational in all these institutions and in all th 
divisions or departments. Strict discipline and unremitting supervision m 
be exercised for the prevention of disorder. Directors and principals are urg 
not to make the least difference in judging of the accomplishments of t 
students, nor to treat them differently from consideraions of sex. In the s' 
jects and methods of instruction only such matters are to be treated as 
admissible in coeducational institutions, and everything is to be omitted whi 
between man and woman, would be avoided from ethical considerations. 
changes shall take place gradually and must be announced in the publis! 
programme of each school. After the close of the school year 1910-11, 
experiences arising from this new departure shall be reported to the minist

     of occupation, will select and find suitable vocations. However, men’s organiza- 
tions have done their part to make the minister’s order illusory. The officers 
of the building trades’ guild have resolved that they will under no circum- 
stances employ girls as apprentices or in any other capacity, and so informed 
the minister, in order to prevent any useless study of their trades on the part 
of girls. 
Still, it is not expected that girls will crowd bricklayers, stone 
masons, trench diggers, road builders, and similar laborers out of 
their occupations. There are many other industries and trades better 
fitted for women, and they will not be slow in making use of the 
opportunities offered by the minister. 
INDUSTRIAL CONTINUATION SCHOOLS IN ZURICH. 
The latest report on industrial continuation schools in the Canton of 
Zurich, Switzerland, contains some items of information of interest at 
the present time. At the beginning of the school year 1906-7, the 
present cantonal law, decreeing compulsory attendance for all indus- 
trial and commercial apprentices, both for boys and girls, came into 
force. The number of students grew rapidly, and with it the number 
of lesson-hours to be provided for, and that of teachers. During the 
first year, after the passage of the law, the number of students in- 
creased from 4,644 to 5,116, or 10 per cent; but while the increase 
lamong the boys was 13.8 per cent, it was only 2.3 per cent among the 
irls between 14 and 17 years of age. The customary apprentice 
xaminations soon revealed the families that had neglected attend- 
nee at schools for apprentices, and fines were inflicted. In conse- 
uence of this the total attendance rose to 6,361, an increase of 24.3 
r cent, or 23.3 per cent among the boys and 26.7 per cent among the 
irls. In 1909 the increase was only 121 students, or 1.9 per cent, 
showing that the law was generally obeyed. 
The number of lesson-hours to be provided for in these schools 
rew with the attendance in almost the same proportion, so that a 
arge number of parallel classes-had to be arranged for. But while, 
ears ago, the number of hours in summer was greatly reduced, there 
now, according to the report, no appreciable difference between sum- 
er and winter sessions. The number of teachers has increased from 
75 to 881, or 37 per cent, in four years. 
The teaching staff consists of elementary school teachers, men and” 
omen, technical teachers for vocational instruction, and teachers 
lor women’s handiwork and other domestic work. The proportion 
f teachers for general culture-studies and for technical branches is 
to 1. Only 11 of the 38 compulsory industrial continuation schools 
the Canton of Zurich (population in 1905 was 459,269) were schools 
ithout direct vocational instruction. These 38 schools are, of course, 
lot all the continuation schools of the Canton; there are altogether 
7 such schools, including agricultural, commercial, domestic-science

     schools, and others. The 88 under discussion are the only ones estab- 
lished for trade or shop apprentices. 
The cantonal government appropriated 82,000 francs exclusively 
for these apprentice schools in 1909; the local school districts, aided 
by federal subsidies, pay the remainder of the costs, the exact amount 
not being ascertainable from the report, owing to the fact that in the 
general accounting the various kinds of continuation schools are not 
separated. 
Many of these 38 industrial schools were started by guilds or labor 
unions, which had an interest in raising the technical skill of their 
youthful members, especially in drawing and sketching; in fact, it 
is asserted that the whole system of industrial schools in Switzerland 
is morally supported and substantially aided by the trades—that is, 
by the manufacturers and their employees. Hence it is that as mem- 
bers of the local boards governing this system of schools skilled 
laborers are elected by the people or appointed by the civil authori- 
ties. The most important point under discussion in connection with 
industrial schools in Zurich, as everywhere else at present, is the 
necessity of preparing suitable teachers, especially teachers for voca- 
tional studies, for not every skilled laborer is also a successful 
teacher, nor can every skillful teacher be also a teacher of technical 
branches with the same success with which he teaches the customary 
elementary branches and scientific studies. 
GERMAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS AND THEIR PREPARATION. 
Doctor Tillmann published in the “ Monatsschrift fiir héhere 
Schulen” a table, which shows the distribution of matriculated 
students in the four faculties of the 21 German universities in the 
summer of 1909, and also, in separate columns, as far as ascertain- 
able, from which of the three kinds of secondary schools they gradu- 
ated. To illustrate the tendencies in Prussian and non-Prussian 
institutions, the author separates the graduates of Prussian schools:

OPENING THE UNIVERSITIES TO NORMAL-SCHOOL GRADUATES. 
   
   
                               
   
              
    
       
    
      
    Admission to universities for teachers who are graduates of normal 
schools is urgently asked in Germany, and several university faculties 
of philosophy are seriously considering the advisability of granting 
the request. The teachers claim that their general and professional 
preparation in normal schools enables them to follow academic lec- 
ture courses and scientific exercises, except that they lack knowledge 
of ancient and modern foreign languages, which deficit in the stu- 
dent’s make-up may either be supplied by private study or by arrang- 
ing courses which do not require extensive linguistic knowledge. 
Recently the University of Géttingen approached the idea of laying 
out a teachers’ course of two years, which is to embrace German, Eng- 
lish, and French, religion, history, higher mathematics, geography, 
physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, mineralogy, biology, and peda- 
gogy. Itis suggested that the course close with a diploma examination. 
Gottingen is not the only higher seat of learning which may in the 
near future be opened to teachers of the lower schools; in Leipzig, 
Giessen, Munich, and other universities the same idea is discussed. 
Prof. Rudolph Eucken, of Jena, remarks in an article on “Aspiration 
of German teachers” as follows: 
The continually increasing aspiration of the teachers of lower schools in Ger- 
many for a higher or university education is a phenomenon of great importance. 
There is a great connected movement among these teachers going on; we see a 
well-developed system of societies, which strive to further not only the personal 
material interests of the members, but also and especially their professional 
work and intellectual progress; we notice an indefatigable literary activity, 
expressing itself particularly in extensive contributions to the pedagogical press; 
but the most characteristic feature of this movement is the endeavor to keep 
lposted on the progress and achievements of the sciences; and since these are 
primarily a concern of the universities, these teachers attempt to gain admis- 
ion of some kind to them, and even to pursue a regular university course of 
tudy. Such efforts have not been without success. Despite all difficulties the 
umber of elementary teachers attending universities is increasing constantly. 
‘hese are as yet in a small minority, while the majority satisfy their desire for 
igher education by attending lecture courses especially designed for teachers, 
artly in university towns, partly in other centers. These courses, which origi- 
ated in Jena and first took firm root in Thuringia, have spread over all Ger- 
any, and are still increasing. Subjects such as philosophy, pedagogy, history, 
literature, the many branches of natural science, and others are treated. 
The results of these courses are the best imaginable. Warm enthusiasm, 
leep earnestness, indefatigable diligence, eager attempts to follow up sugges- 
‘ions obtained by continued study, and generally abiding effects of impressions 
eceived are what the professors everywhere notice. In order to hear these 
tures, some teachers had to walk many miles; they heeded neither storm nor 
jain, neither heat nor cold. What most distinguished the spirit prompting them 
as this—that they did not desire any mere popular presentation of the subjects 
eated, any easy-going but enfeebled exposition; they wished to go back to the 
untain heads of knowledge, and shunned neither the trouble nor the labor it

     cost to attain that end. Every professor taking part in these lecture courses 
was impressed with the genuine desire for higher education manifested by his 
hearers, and felt the rare joy of finding audiences really hungry and thirsty for 
more knowledge and intellectual activity—a pleasant contrast to the prevalent 
satiety of the times. 
Such earnest and self-sacrificing efforts pervading the whole of a great 
_profession can not be attributed to small personal motives or social ambition. 
The true impulse proceeds rather from the desire to dignify the work of their 
calling and bring the people’s schools into a closer and more fruitful relation 
with the intellectual life of the nation. A natural outcome of this striving on 
the part of the teachers is the desire for admission to the university. In truth, 
great changes are in progress in this field, where an older and a newer way of 
thinking clash irreconcilably. The question thereby opened is a question of 
principle regarding the purpose of the people’s schools and the estimate which 
is to be set upon their value. Formerly the idea was to limit the work of the 
schools to giving the great mass of people a very slender stock of absolutely 
indispensable knowledge and accomplishments. Under such limitation of the 
aim of school a certain mechanical training of the teachers sufficed, a training 
which seemed the better adapted the more it kept aloof from the intellectual 
movements of the times. Every close contact with modern currents of thouglit 
might appear as a dangerous disturbance. Yet it can not be asserted that such 
views are entirely abandoned even to-day. However, they have become the 
views of an extreme party, which vainly attempts to turn back the wheel of 
time; the work of to-day is carried on altogether according to a new way of 
thinking. 
This new way of thinking is inseparably connected with the origin and de- 
velopment of the new pedagogy. To men like Pestalozzi and Frébel the people’s| 
school is not a school merely for the needy, a special school for the lowest strata, 
but a general institution designed for educating the youth of the nation, an 
abode of “entwickelnd erziehender Menschenbildung.” The human being is| 
here to be taken charge of in the totality of his powers and lifted to the huma: 
level. The means to that end may be simpler in the elementary school than i 
other seats of learning, but the object in view is essentially the same, and it i: 
this greater simplicity of means which allows the advantage of a more direc 
influence upon the growth of the soul. Those educational pioneers entertaine 
the conviction that the process of education should extend back farther tha: 
had been the rule—back to the beginning; that it should be elementary to ¢ 
greater degree than heretofore; and that all subsequent instruction could gai 
no proper foothold unless based upon thorough elementary work. 
It was impossible to set such high value upon the beginnings and not at th 
same time recognize the extreme gravity and difficulty of the teacher’s dutie: 
as thus extended. The enlargement of the scope of the people’s schools mus} 
also directly elevate the work of the teachers and their standing as a clas: 
Hence, the demands upon the teacher’s preparation must also change. To b 
an educator of human beings is impossible without a scientific method, witho 
ethical convictions, and psychological insight. Nor is it possible without 
large degree of freedom in action and the closest contact with the intellectu 
life of the time. A natural consequence of such aspirations of elementar, 
teachers is the undeniable desire to enter into relations with the universit; 
for with us the university is the chief place where teaching and investigatio| 
come in contact with one another, where both are interwoven, where t 
probleins of the time are in flux, and where the student may rise to intellectu: 
independence and develop his individuality. To exclude any part of our nation:
-P-A-G-E-497

ntellectual labor from the university would mean to deprive it of freedom of 
novement; it would mean loosening its connection with the totality of national 
ntellectual life. 
NATIVE AND FOREIGN STUDENTS IN GERMAN UNIVERSITIES. 
The total number of students in the 21 German universities during

The increase in the number of matriculated women students con-

nter. Berlin with 638, Munich with 183, Géttingen. with 160, 
idelberg with 142, and Bonn with 135 women students appear to 
lve more attraction for women than the other universities. The 
mber of nonmatriculated young women rose from 1,772 to 1,928. 
he foreign matriculated students in German universities were 
09 in number, an increase of 332 over the previous winter. Of 
se 1,349 were in Berlin, 749 in Munich, 618 in Leipzig, 278 in 
Ile, and 211 in Heidelberg; the remaining 1,204 were scattered 
ong the other universities. There was an increase in the number 
dying medicine, philosophy, philology, and history, while the 
ural sciences show a slight decrease. There were 1,858 students 
m Russia, most of whom came from the Baltic provinces, Fin- 
d and Poland; 792 from Austria-Hungary; 332 from the Amer- 
, chiefly from the United States; 302 from Switzerland; 186

WOMEN STUDENTS IN PRUSSIAN UNIVERSITIES. 
This year another great increase in the number of women student 
in the universities of Prussia is to be recorded. In South Germa: 
universities women had been admitted for many years, while th 
Prussian universities had been opened to them only if they came 
hearers; matriculation, and hence a claim to employment by t 
State if they passed the required examinations, was denied ther

Councilor Tillman, of the Prussian ministry of education, announce 
the following summary for the winter semester of 1909-10. 
states that 2,324 women were matriculated, an increase of 468 over t 
preceding winter semester. Of the four faculties, theology, law, me: 
cine, and philosophy (the latter includes both branches, (a) ment; 
philosophy, philology, and history,and (6) mathematics and natur 
philosophy), the faculty of philosophy has the largest number 
women students, since it prepares teachers for secondary schoo 
Their number was 2,004, as against 1,453 in the previous year. 1) 
medical faculty had 266 women students, as against 188 in the p 
vious year. The faculty of theology also shows an increase, name 
from 22 to 39, but the faculty of law, which includes the study 
administration, had a slight decrease in the number of women s 
dents, namely, from 17 to 15. <A general observation is that t 
young women in secondary as well as in higher institutions of lea

Thus we see them select languages, ancient and modern, literatu

acteristic of Germany. The same observation is made in every co 
try where women are admitted to higher study and research.

The vacation courses in the University of Jena, Thuringia, w 
were begun in 1889 by 2 professors, Detmer and Rein, and whicl 
first embraced natural science and pedagogy, have increased 
importance and extent, so that in 1909 the number of professors 
49 and that of the students 662. To the two branches with w 
the courses were opened have since been added the following: L 
guages, history, fine arts, theology, geography, political econo}

GERMAN HIGHER EDUCATION REVIEWED. 
The new rector of the University of Munich, the second largest 
stitution of the kind in Germany, Prof. Hermann Paul, reviews in 
s inaugural address the German system of secondary and higher 
ucation, and indulges in severe criticism, which, coming from the 
lurce it does, may tone down the fulsome praise so often bestowed 
on the system. The address contains the following passages: 
shall not ask how often the ideal aims of university study are actually 
ched. Let us apply a more modest standard measure. The number of stu- 
ts who fail entirely is not insignificant. But greater is the number of those 
0, though passing prescribed school examinations, and thereby obtaining 
laim to appointment in state service, are really unfit for service, and who, 
they become in the course of years useful members of human society, owe 
le of that development to their university study. First, we have to admit 
o be a grave fault that a not insignificant number of students admitted to 
universities are not sufficiently equipped mentally for success in higher 
ication. There is no question that many are dragged through the prepara- 
ly secondary schools who deserve to be eliminated for good reasons. The 
ses of this are not far to seek. 
Most men, and also most teachers, are induced to be lenient so long as it is 
at their own expense, and they forget to consider that their leniency injures 
only the rest of mankind, but also those whom they intend to benefit, since, 
fact, however, they injure them by leniency. Hence, such teachers are 
id when confronted with the criticism of the public, especially the criti- 
of the weaklings’ parents, many of whom are in high social positions; 
ther must be considered the fear, on the part of the class teachers, of the 
lool principal, who is apt to blame the former if many of his students are 
t for promotion. In Catholic districts it is not infrequently found that 
nasium students, destined to become students of theology, are treated with 
hh more indulgence than other students. It is easily understood, but not 
@ approved, that indulgence is shown to mentally slow and even weak 
lents, who are not indolent, but who fail to progress like normally 
lowed students. With regard to such the apparent indulgence becomes 
lty, because by promoting them to higher grades they are prevented in 
from turning to professions in which their inborn aptitudes might suffice. 
would it.be possible to promote such students to the highest grades at 
if it were not for the fact that too much stress is laid upon dry memory 
ik and too little upon the training of intellectual power, without which all 
ory work is useless.

things too much atteption is paid to memorized knowledge and its mechanica|

Jack of interest. It is unquestionable that among those who pass with a gradu: 
tion diploma into the university there are many who have neither aspiratio. 
for a general higher education nor inclination for a special science or a futw 
profession. The fault of this is charged in no small degree to the school, an 
not alone because of leniency toward those wanting in capacity. That soi 
teachers should be unable to awaken interest is perhaps an unavoidable circu! 
stance, which can be improved only by careful elimination of incapable cand 
dates for the teachers’ profession. Certain it is that a reform of many branch 
of study can take place only through greater interest on the part of 
students. The student, according to my opinion, is too much accustomed 
finish the set tasks and does nothing to follow his own inclination. Whenev: 
an especial interest is discovered it is not promoted, but rather smothered 
suit a uniform set scheme or course. 
I believe the transition from school to university would be facilitated 
instructors in the upper grades of secondary schools were given more liberty; 
the number of obligatory studies were decreased and a larger number of studi 
were left optional. But even if that should be rejected the home work of t 
students might receive a more individual character, provided, of course, t! 
necessary time be given for it. Such liberty may very well be granted wit! 
the control of the teacher. Among this individual student’s work I class t 
compositions, for which no uniform themes should be set; such set themes 
apt to be treated with distaste and to result in unnatural, artificial phraseolo; 
The students might be allowed to choose their own themes and exhibit 
results of certain studies. Of course there will always be Students with wh 
the best pedagogical methods prove of no avail to rouse them to volunt: 
activity ; such have no place in a university. 
Moreover, there are the numerous dissipations in which academic yo 
indulge, talented as well as mediocre and stupid students, well trained a] 
poorly trained. I shall not waste time in general moral exhortations, wh: 
are apt to prove useless in the face of frivolity and lack of energy. Only # 
much I desire to say: A student should seek his education not merely 
lecture rooms and behind books. Though he make use of all opportuni 
offering themselves, to awaken his interest in many ways, as well as streng' 
his body and develop his physical skill; though he may indulge in cheer] 
enjoyment of life, such as is suitable to youth—there may be much allo 
in this respect—yet, a respectable amount of time would remain for act 
study, and much might be gained, if that time were utilized in a proper m| 
ner. But to think that in order to use one’s youth to the full, one should w: 
several semesters, is an error that will revenge itself. The results of suc! 
life are too often hours of ennui, surfeited disposition and physical distem) 
aside from the fact, that few succeed in freeing themselves from such a €o’ 
tion, when once produced by irrational indulgence. 
Professor Paul then points to the fact that desire to obtain hig! 
education is rarely the object of those who flock to the universit 
In most cases it is the prospect of a future support in the Sta 
service, or in other positions which will guarantee an ample inco

                                                    importance given to the value of memorized matters; that, however, 
has fatal consequences. 
A student who thinks that cramming the memory is all that is needed to 
pass examinations, easily argues thus: “ Why should I begin during the first 
semester to learn things I am apt to forget, before I need them in examination? 
I will rather wait till the end of my course, so that my memory may be fresh 
during the examination.” And hence, the university career of many is divided 
into two parts of unequal length: A long one, in which they merely copy notes 
taken at lectures, and a brief one in which they cram their memory as much 
as possible with what they have jotted down. * * * He who is in earnest 
about his education should from the beginning not be satisfied to make notes 
of the salient points of lectures, but make earnest attempts at assimilating the 
matter. * * * No student should engage more lecture courses than he is 
capable and willing to utilize. The main cause why so many students are 
engaging to follow too many courses is found in the wish of their families, 
or their own wish, to spénd no more time at the university than is prescribed 
by the state examination regulations. This wish is especially urgent in cases 
where state examinations are held only once a year, and where therefore a 
delay may mean a loss of an entire year. 
The rector’s address dwells upon the most fatal condition of uni- 
versity study—the mere receptive conduct of most students through 
the period of many semesters. Professor Paul demands more ele- 
mentary exercises (similar to the tutorial instruction at English 
colleges and universities), during the first semesters. It should be 
the aim of the faculty to read no interpretation lectures without the 
active participation of its hearers. For exercises of another kind 
more must be presupposed, as a rule, and they can not be commenced 
ite so early, but it would not be necessary to postpone them till

      EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 497 
Evening schools and higher elementary schools (formerly higher 
grade schools) were integral parts of the elementary-school system 
before the passage of the law of 1902 or the creation of the board of 
education in 1899. They represent the highest development of the 
system of elementary education, in respect to which England has 
made phenomenal advance in the last twenty years, mainly through 
municipal enterprise.

The foregoing statistics pertaining to the system of public educa- 
ion are drawn from the latest report of the board of education, 
overing the scholastic year 1907-8. The operations of the system 
or the scholastic year just closed (1909-10) were summarized by the 
resident of the board in his statement before a committee of the 
ouse, July 14, supporting the motion for a grant of £8,660,000 to 
omplete the sum necessary to defray the charges which would come 
pon the board during the year ending March 31, 1911. This sum- 
ary showed continued advance in every particular that can be 
umerically expressed.    
   
   
CURRENT MOVEMENTS. 
TREND OF RECENT LEGISLATION. 
   The settlement of the education controversy in England, in com- 
on with larger questions of parliamentary policies, has been deferred 
ls a consequence of the unexpected death of King Edward VII. 
he educational unrest remains, however, and the leaders of opinion 
d action in both parties are discussing settlement plans; the con-

ciliatory spirit of these discussions leads to the hope that a measur 
which shall be acceptable to Liberals and Conservatives alike, anc 
shall conserve both vested and individual rights, will be forthcoming 
While measures relating to the administrative policy of the nationa 
system of education are thus in abeyance, there is great activity in 
practical directions, more especially in respect to the new dutie 
imposed by the education law of 1902, the provision of meals act o 
1906, the education (administrative provisions) act of 1907, and th 
children act of 1908. 
These duties relate to the extension of the school period, the pro 
vision of agencies for higher (i. e., secondary and technical) educa 
tion, care for the health and physical welfare of children, and fo 
the protection and control of neglected and wayward children. 
Part IT of the education act of 1902 provides that— 
2. (1) The local education authority shall consider the educational needs of thei 
area and take such steps as seem to them desirable, after consultation with the boar 
of education, to supply or aid the supply of education other than elementary, and t 
promote the general coordination of all forms of education, and for that purpose shal 
apply all or so much as they deem necessary of the residue under section one of th 
local taxation (customs and excise) act, 1890, and shall carry forward for the lik 
purpose any balance thereof which may remain unexpended, and may spend sucl 
further sums as they think fit: Provided, That the amount raised by the council of : 
county for the purpose in any year out of rates under this act shall not exceed th 
amount which would be produced by arate of two pence in the pound, or such high 
rate as the county council, with the consent of the local government board, may fi 
(2) A councii in exercising their powers under this part of this act shall have regar 
to any existing supply of efficient schools or colleges, and to any steps already take 
for the purposes of higher education under the technical instruction acts, 1889 ani 
1891. 
3. The council of any noncounty borough or urban district shall have power as we 
as the county council to spend such sums as they think fit for the purpose of supplyi 
or aiding the supply of education other than elementary: Provided, That the amow: 
raised by the council of a noncounty borough or urban district for the purpose in an| 
year out of rates under this act shall not exceed the amount which would be produc 
by a rate of one penny in the pound. 
     
    
   
      
        
       
     
    
     
    The administrative provisions act authorizes the local authoriti 
to aid, by scholarships or bursaries, the instruction in public eleme: 
tary schools of scholars from the age of 12 up to the limit of a 
(16 years) fixed for the provision of instruction in a public elementa: 
school, and, with the consent of the board of education, to exte: 
this aid beyond the age of 16 years. This act provides also thi 
money may be expended in maintaining— 
for children attending a public elementary school, vacation schools, vacation class 
play centers, or other means of recreation during their holidays or at such other ti 
as the local education authority may prescribe, in the schoolhouse or in some o 
suitable place in the vicinity, so far as the local education authority, in the case o} 
schoolhouse or place not belonging to them, can obtain for the purpose the use of t| 
schoolhouse or place. The law also makes it the duty of the local authorities ‘ 
provide for the medical inspection of children immediately before or at the time

her occasions as the board of education direct,’’ and ‘‘to make such arrangements 
may be sanctioned by the board of education for attending to the health and phys- 
1 condition of the children educated in public elementary schools.”’ 
The children act is not strictly an educational measure, its main 
rpose being to bring into one systematized statute previous enact- 
ents on the same subject, and also to extend the legal provision for 
e care and control of the child population. It does, however, 
tend the province of the local education authorities, especially 
lhool attendance officers, and strengthens, directly and by indirect 
uence, the compulsory school attendance laws. 
It will be observed that, in every case, the execution of these laws 
ich, as regards many of their provisions, are permissive merely, 
ts upon the local education authorities. The difficulty in the way 
focusing attention upon the great things that are being done in 
gland to meet the necessities which are back of the laws themselves, 
y be understood from the fact that these local authorities include at 
sent 62 county councils, 74 county boroughs, 137 autonomous 
micipal boroughs, 54 urban districts, and the Isles of Scilly; total, 
It would therefore be impossible here to do more than present a

practical wisdom, without expenditure so immense as to provoke reaction, and 
the convinced cooperation of enlightened employers of labor, and of all parents

ressing questions of the day. That the country has begun to realize the gravity 
e situation is due in great measure to the devoted labors of many administrators 
teachers who are present at this meeting. The country is also under obligation 
hers: To Dr. Stanley Hall, of Clark University, Worcester, Mass., for throwing 
bold relief the educational problem of adolescence; to several of the inspectors of

in diffusing interest in the question, and in suggesting methods of dealing with it;

of Yorkshire, Halifax, Lancashire, Bury, Rochdale, Widnes, St. Helens, Accringtor 
Haslingden, Cheshire, Gloucestershire, Cambridgeshire, and Finchley, for skilful an 
successful grappling with the educational difficulties involved; to many publi

many, and especially to Doctor Kerschensteiner, stadschulrat of the city of Munic 
for showing what can be done to meet the educational needs of adolescence, and 
setting the problem in right economic perspective; to the press, for giving prominen 
to the complex issues of the problem; and last, but not least, to Scotland (to whi 
English education owes already so great a debt), for leading the way in the Unit 
Kingdom toward a great extension of the educational responsibility of paren 
employers, and the State. 
These forces have already changed the attitude of public opinion. * * * 
have in England to-day the promise of effective advance: First, through a stir 
public opinion; secondly, through a careful examination and comparison of success! 
local experience; thirdly, through a courageous analysis of the economic and mo} 
factors of the situation, as well as of the strictly educational issues; and finally, thro 
legislation, adding to the powers of the central and local education authorities, aj 
formally recognizing the responsibilities of employers and of parents toward yo 
people during the critical years of adolescence, and of what, in modern life, co: 
sponds to the stage of apprenticeship. 
Out of some 1,300,000 boys and girls in England and Wales who are between 12 
14 years of age, there are (to the best of our knowledge) about 211,000 (in additio: 
partial exemption scholars) who have already obtained exemption from attendanc: 
school, and are receiving no further systematic education. Out of the 2,000,000 yo 
people in England and Wales who have passed their fourteenth birthday but are 
under 17 years of age, only one in four (so far as our knowledge goes) receives on w: 
days any continued education. ‘‘The result” (I quote the finding of the consulta 
committee) ‘‘is a tragic waste of early promise. Through lack of technical trainij 
hundreds of thousands of young people fail to acquire the self-adaptiveness and 
terity in handicraft which would enable them to rise to the higher levels of ski 
employment. Through lack of suitable physical training their bodily powers 
insufficiently developed and their self-control impaired. Through lack of gen, 
training their mental outlook remains narrow, their sympathies uncultivated, 
capacity for cooperation in civic welfare stunted and untrained. In the meanti 
modern industry, in some of its developments, is exploiting boy and girl labor du 
the years of adolescence. An increasing number of ‘blind-alley’ employments te 
boys and girls, at the close of their day-school course, by relatively high rat 
wages which furnish opportunities of too early independence, but give no promi: 
permanent occupation and weaken the ties of parental control.” 
The present state of things is not only intellectually and economically wasteful, 
often morally mischievous. City life enhances the danger. Unskilled, or relati 
unskilled, employment at 13, with good money, tempts a boy (and an increasing 
ber of girls) like a baited trap. A lad is drawn into a way of life which leaves hii 
16 or 17 without a trade to his fingers, and with the habit of steady learning clean 
outofhishead. The years between 13 and 16 or 17 are the years of educational lea’

   Differ as we may in judgment as to the legislative treatment of the problem, we find, 
I think, but little disagreement among ourselves in educational aim. Do we not 
virtually concur in thinking that all boys and girls ought to receive, during the years 
of adolescence, some form of continued education which will develop their physique, 
widen their mental outlook, cultivate their sympathies, prepare them for the responsi- 
bilities of parenthood, equip them for trustworthy efficiency in the occupation by 
which they will earn their livelihood, and fit them for the duties of citizenship? If 
this is to be done, it will be necessary to mortise the work of the day and evening 
technical classes into the work of the elementary day schools. We need in the latter 
more training of the hand and of the constructive powers, not with any prematurely 
technical purpose, but as a necessary factor in brain development and in a liberal 
education. This will not be possible unless we have smaller classes in the elementary 
day schools and unless the course of training for teachers can be so prolonged as to 
permit training in educational handwork to be included in their course of professional 
preparation without congestion of studies, without over-pressure of mind, without 
encroachment upon the indispensable liberal education, and without undue curtail- 
ment of that mental leisure which is needed for all healthy growth of interest, orig- 
inality, and purpose. Nor do we conceive of the technical class, whether day or 
evening, as purely utilitarian or technological. Direct bearing upon subsequent 
employment or occupation it must have. But inseparable from its true educational 
influence is careful regard for the training of the body, for the cultivation of the sym- 
pathies and of the imagination by the love of literature, by music and by art, for an 
opening of the mind to the significance of civic responsibility, and also for those influ- 
ences (often most powerful when least expressed in words) which help in forming a 
purposeful, steadfast, and disinterested character. 
* * * * * * * 
It is because in certain parts of Germany, and especially in Munich, and in 
the Kingdom of Wurttemberg, the technical education during adolescence has been 
so arranged as to include the element of civic training that we gratefully acknowledge 
the stimulus which educational administrators in this country have received from 
German example. But there is nothing in the German achievement, highly suc- 
cessful as it has been in many places, which need make us feel that we are hopelessly 
intherear. * * * There is some reason to think that, even in the progressive parts 
of Germany (and there are large regions in which education is the reverse of progres- 
sive), the problem of securing continued education for the majority of girls, and also 
for those boys who are not intending to enter a skilled trade, is still far from having 
been efiectively solved. We in England have indeed much to learn from Germany 
and from some of the cantons of Switzerland, but it is right to remember that, for 
historical reasons which are far from discreditable to us, we have approached the prob- 
lem from the point of view of the individual rather than from the point of view of the 
State. I can find no country in which the voluntary attendance at evening classes 
‘is so large in proportion to the adult population as it isin England and Wales. I would 
venture to urge that our task is so to use the collective power of the State as to stimulate, 
but not to supersede, the energy and forethought of the individual. Bureaucratic 
collectivism in education seems to me as false an ideal as, at the opposite extreme, is 
chaotic and plunging individualism. 
Under the head of special English difficulties, Doctor Sadler noted 
(1) the psychological—that is, the deep-seated—conviction on the 
art of the majority of English parents that a child’s education ends 
hen he leaves the elementary day school; (2) a lack of insight, on

    meaning and value of education, and their failure to discharge their 
moral responsibility for the further education of the young people 
in their employment; (3) the noneducational tradition of the English 
trades unions; (4) administrative difficulties; (5) economic conditions. 
Under the last consideration, Doctor Sadler said: 
A system of compulsory attendance at continuation schools of all young persons 
between 14 and 17 years of age would, if universally applied in a satisfactory 
manner, involve for maintenance alone an additional annual expenditure of £2,500,000. 
For my own part, I believe that if the work in continuation schools were made (as it 
should be made) thoroughly practical, the cost would be considerably greater. 
* * * * * * * 
Even more serious, however, than the problem of taxation and of rates is the diffi- 
culty of adjusting a system of industry, competitive in most of its presuppositions, to 
an ideal of education which is in large measure collective in purpose. If the antith- 
esis were a sharp one between an impenitently individualistic industrial system 
and a wholly collectivist theory of national education, we might well despair of a suc- 
cessful issue. But the antithesis is not so sharp as that. Industry itself retains much 
of the corporate spirit, and the trend of things is in many respects toward an increase 
of corporate organization in business matters. * * * The nation, like the indi- 
vidual, must be responsive to what is true in both ideals, for educational truth, like 
moral truth, is reached, in Pascal’s words, ‘‘by a bold combination of opposites.”” 
HIGHER ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
The higher elementary school affords the only means of prolonging 
the systematic education of the majority of children in the Kingdom, 
and the Government offers an inducement to the local authorities 
to maintain schools of this advanced grade by an extra grant for 
these schools when they conform to specified conditions. These 
conditions are especially helpful in the smaller communities, but 
they have not proved entirely satisfactory to the education authori- 
ties of the large cities. The twenty-two schools of this class in Lon- 
don have been withdrawn from the grant list since 1907, as stated 
by the county council in their report for 1909, as follows: 
The council has abandoned its intention to provide additional higher elementary 
schools under Chapter VI of the code, in view of the fact that after prolonged negotia- 
tions with the board of education it was unable to obtain any substantial concessions 
on various fundamental questions. Consideration is therefore now being given to the 
question of the organization of a system of schools for pupils over 114 years of age ofa 
different character from the ordinary elementary school, but not subject to the board’s 
regulations for higher elementary schools. With a view to assisting the inquiry, 
the council has agreed that as an experiment a specially approved curriculum should) 
be put into operation at certain existing departments. 
These experiments are vocational in their character, using the 
word as it is now current in educational discussions in this country, 
Manchester, which under the régime of school boards led the coun. 
try in the establishment of higher grade schools, has recently organize 
six higher elementary or ‘‘central” schools of anew type. In respec 
to the earlier high schools, the present chairman of the educatio 
committee says:
-P-A-G-E-511
  EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 503 
A continuous stream of clever boys and girls went out from these schools, and their 
successes in obtaining scholarships at secondary schools and subsequently at the 
iversities proved the practical value of the carrying out of those traditions of elemen- 
ary education which now in some quarters it has become the fashion to hold up to 
(derision, and that on the part of persons who have yet to prove that the carrying out 
pf their ideas will ever be attended by like success. The best traditions of elemen- 
ary education mainly consist in the careful bringing up to a state of efficiency of the 
whole of every class in the school, rather than placing reliance upon a few of the more 
‘lever boys and girls, who receive special attention at the cost, I fear, of the remainder 
hnd far larger numbes. These traditions, I venture to think, are still worthy of 
pncouragement. 
After rehearsing briefly the measures which destroyed these earlier 
schools, the chairman continues: 
Seeing that there was no future for schools so constituted, and being desirous of 
iving greater scope to the initiative of the teachers, we have established six of these 
entral schools, and their aim will be thoroughly to equip boys and girls for indus- 
ial, commercial, and home life. In Manchester there is always a large demand for 
vell-educated youths for the office and warehouse—boys thoroughly well grounded 
n arithmetic and English. In the central schools it will be our aim to meet this 
emand. 
At a time when an increasing number of girls take up office and secretarial work it 
k absolutely essential that their special interests should not be neglected, and here 
so the central schools should be of great assistance to parents desirous of having their 
laughters so equipped. Another most important feature of the work of the central 
hools will be the practical housewifery classes. Each of these central schools will 
ve attached to it a cottage simply furnished, with cookery utensils and laundry 
ppliances. The special teachers in charge of the centers will reside in the cottage, 
nd thus housework will be provided for the girls, who will receive a continuous course 
instruction of about eight weeks’ duration. The aim will be to show how in a sim- 
e and practical way the week’s work of an ordinary house is carried out in the best 
hd most orderly manner. 
This branch of the central school is of such vast importance that it is worth while 
go a little into detail. The general instruction throughout the course for the elder 
Is will deal with the qualifications of a good housewife—importance of cleanliness 
nd order in the home; care and cleaning of sitting room, kitchen, scullery, bedroom, 
hirs, passages, washhouse, etc.; cleaning of flues, black leading, laying and lighting 
es, washing up, care of glass, silver, knives, care of linoleum and oilcloth, carpets, 
fats, etc.; care of household brushes, laying and clearing the table, sewing, darning, 
pusehold mending and patching, making aprons; etc.; home hygiene, simple first 
; the laying out of money to best advantage. The cookery will deal with the plan 
d preparation of the week’s dinners, marketing, tea and coffee making, bread and 
ike making, jam making, cost of dinners, household accounts, household washing, 
th practical instruction of preparation for week’s wash, sorting clothes, mending, 
moving stains, steeping clothes, etc.; washing of linen and flannels, drying, folding, 
hngling, ironing, and airing clothes. I have ventured to go somewhat into particu- 
s in order to emphasize the thorough character of the essential training in household 
fairs which should be thoroughly taught to girls. 
he school course will extend over four years. In the third and fourth years the 
struction will be especially adapted to meet the future needs of the children. For 
s purpose the school will be arranged so as to provide (1) an industrial section, 
d (2) a commercial section, which will give the children opportunities of making 
bcial study of the subjects particularly appertaining to the nature of their prospective 
ployments.

    The committee have decided to adopt the system of granting leaving certificates, 
and hope thereby to give the pupils a definite aim in their courses of study, and also 
to provide prospective employers with a reliable guarantee as to the efficiency of the 
instruction imparted. This system will also tend to abolish the not altogether satis- 
factory examinations adopted in some instances by public bodies and others whe 
dealing with youthful applicants for employment. The leaving certificates examina: 
tion will be conducted by the committee’s inspectors of schools yearly at the end of 
June, and will be open to all pupils who have completed their fifteenth year. Th 
six central schools are conveniently situated, and will meet the needs of the differen 
parts of the city. I venture to hope that this development of educational faciliti 
will conduce to the progress of those children in the public elementary schools of thi 
city who are so happily circumstanced as to be able to remain at school beyond thi 
ordinary age. 
The experiments in Manchester and London will undoubtedly bi 
followed in other cities and counties. Hence it may be said tha 
vocational, or industrial training, as distinct from either general o: 
technical education, has found a secure place in the English syste 
of public education. 
From the detailed explanations of the workings of the system mad 
by the president of the board, in his address on the budget, th 
following statements are quoted: 
RURAL EDUCATION. 
Every experiment of importance has taken the form of emancipating the childre: 
and one of these, to which I wish to draw the attention of the House, is in a rural are: 
Schools which are conducted amid rural surroundings may have a rural developme: 
in the school. They may be conducted with a definite rural bias, or they may 
specialized rural schools. The ruralizing of education is by no means a difficu| 
matter. There is no reason in the world why all the equipment that surrounds 
rural school should not be used for the purposes of education. The playground, tl 
fields, a haystack, a cow house—all these things may be used as exercises in arit! 
metic and mensuration. The parish church or any old buildings in the neighborho 
can be used for the purpose of illustrating history. The natural environment of t 
school will enable them to make explorations into nature study. The physiographic} 
environment, roads, railways, woods, heaths, meadows, the industries, the rocks, ai 
the soil can all be used as starting points in geography, and I am sure the honoral 
gentlemen opposite would agree that in no way can you start more profitably in teac 
ing geography than by starting m the immediate neighborhood of the child’s o 
home and school. 
I take one of the best cases which has come under my notice. I hold it up as 
example to other parts of the country. I hope the other 19,000 which I de not m 
tion will not be jealous. Itisaschool in Cheshire. There are 200 boys on the regist 
They have five forms. They have a head master, three trained certificated teache 
and one uncertificated. The school, as some honorable members know, lies on 
outskirts of Altrincham. Although it is in the county it is so near the town tha 
can be attended by the town children. What is its scheme? It provides for 
ordinary subjects, and in addition it has organized bee keeping, woodwork, gard 
ing, and practical nature study. Metal work and glasswork have just been introduc

-P-A-G-E-513
  EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES. - - 505 
Gardening is correlated with arithmetic and with English, for they have to write an 
account of all they have done with nature study and with what is known as hand 
and eye work. Bee keeping is taught to all the boys. They regard it as very great 
fun, and fourteen of them are known as “‘bee keepers.’ Seed testing is also conducted 
under the same rules. When my inspector first drew my attention to this he said 
that he found in the workshop there was a garden frame being made. They were 
finishing off the garden gate. One scholar had been making a model of a weigh bridge 
out of his own head. A good deal of attention was paid to nature study and drawing, 
and the school garden was planned by themselves, containing a number of beehives. 
There was every kind of experimental work, and the boys were cooperating in making 
a wind pump from their own design, pumping water out of their own well. This is 
a really intelligent school, and what is remarkable in it is that in the ordinary dry 
subjects, the A B CO of elementary school work, the children are more efficient than 
in any of the surrounding schools. I thought the head master had done good work 
there. I thought he had done such good work that I might have him on my staff, 
land I appointed him two months ago. The managers of the school, I believe, disap- 
rove of the appointment, but I am going to use him as soon as he has learned the 
wdinary routine of his work to act as a missionary and to carry out in other parts of 
e country the results of his own experiment. 
HIGHER AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 
Agricultural and rural work is done not only in the elementary schools—it is done 
our secondary schools, as well as in technical schools. The agricultural work con- 
ucted under the board in the West Riding has resulted in a great spread of agricul- 
ural education in the evening schoois. At Bedford they have an excellent farm school. 
n Wiltshire they have an itinerant instructor, or more than one, in manual farm proc- 
sses. In Lindsey, one of the greatest of the agricultural areas, they have agricultural 
cholarships which carry their scholars right up to our universities. In Nottingham- 
hire they train elementary-school teachers in rural subjects. All this is good work, 
nd is the growth of the last few years. But it is impossible that it should go on and 
e well done unless our instructors are paid good salaries. At present, I am sorry to 
, I find the best of the agricultural instructors, trained in the agricultural depart- 
ent at, Cambridge, instead of finding employment under our own county councils, 
‘0 out to the colonies. I wish the colonies well, but I should wish first of all that our 
wn counties should get the benefit of their services. But we can not retain them in 
is country unless we are prepared to pay them a living wage. Then there have 
een agricultural institutes put up here and there. All these are receiving the board’s 
issistance. In the counties, in respect of which what is called the Block grant was not 
aid, the number of schools and classes recognized by the board in which agricultural 
bjects were taught was 429 in 1908-9. It is more than that now. That was a rise 
‘om 300 only three years previously. In the secondary schools in counties in respect 
which the Block grant was paid the number of centers recognized by the board in 
hich agricultural subjects were taught rose from nothing in 1906 to about 190 in 1910. 
ll this means that there has been a great growth in the desire to reorganize and to use 
ch agricultural educational opportunities as can beoffered by the local authorities... 
me of the most remarkable rises has, however, been in the number of school gardens. 
1904-5 there were only five secondary schools earning the special grant for gardening. 
think there were about 8,000 scholars at that time. At the present moment there 
‘e over 1,900 schools earning a grant for this purpose, and over 28,000 scholars are to 
found taking advantage of these gardening classes. The rural courses in secondary 
thools have also been much improved. I hope, sooner or later, the disadvantage 
der which the rural areas have labored, in not having the education of their districts 
ught into close relation with the main industry of their districts, will be a fault in 
educational system which will have passed away.

     It is necessary in order to secure that the funds spent on evening classes and evening 
schools should be spent to the best advantage that we ought to insist upon greater 
regularity on the part of the students. That is one of the reforms we look forward to 
in the future. The work done in these classes covers a vast range of subjects, and we 
are not prepared to exclude any subject provided it comes properly within the category 
of the classes. Any reasonable subject of real educational value may count for the 
purposes of the grant. A great deal of the work is of the greatest value. I recently 
visited a technical class at Burnley, and I found there not only were students taught 
to use their hands and eyes to good effect, but I found there some of the best pure 
science classes in the United Kingdom, and out of seven scholarships granted in the| 
United Kingdom no fewer than four were won by that school. The work done in the: 
classes must, however, very largely depend upon the amount of time expended by th 
student in his daily avocation. It is impossible that a student who commences wor! 
at 6 o’clock in the morning, and, with short intervals for breakfast and dinner only: 
leaves off at 5.30, should have the energy to take full advantage of the evening class 
thus provided. Granting that they give six evening hours a week, and which, indeed 
is a standing allowance, it is placing a strain on some students far beyond what the 
can bear. I have recently heard of some young students in Leeds who have broke: 
down under the strain of doing their daily work and of attending evening classes. I 
they had lived in Middlesborough, Manchester, Harwich, Birmingham, Coventry; 
Derby, or Swindon, they would have been able to attend these classes during the da: 
by the permission of their employers, and, I would add, by the encouragement of thei 
employers. That is a matter which, I trust, will commend itself, not only to thi 
who control our great railway companies, but also to small as well as large employe 
throughout the United Kingdom. The improvement required there must of necessit; 
come from the largest employers first. I think a word of credit is due to the Admiralt; 
because they have led the way in this matter. As early even as 1843 they allowe 
some of their young persons who work in their dockyards and works to attend technic: 
classes during their work hours. Some of the railway companies are also taking u 
this subject with a degree of enthusiasm which does them every credit. Recently th 
Great Northern Railway Company, who have a very large number of boys in thei 
employ in London, have been insisting that in every case their boys should atten 
some classes, and many of these classes during their work hours. That example ma: 
well be followed in other parts of the country. Only by following it shall we be ab 
to get into our schools boys between the ages of 13 and 17 in such a way as to enab. 
them to take full advantage of the facilities there offered. Scotland, as usual, is le: 
ing the way in this matter, and the act for Scotland passed two years ago, I hope, wii 
be followed by an act equally applicable to England, providing that attendance 
continuation classes shall up to 17 years of age be compulsory. 
MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS. 
The administrative provisions act, as already stated, made it 
duty of the local authorities of England tc provide for the medic 
inspection of school children and to make arrangements, with t! 
sanction of the Board of Education, for looking after the health a 
physical well-being of the pupils outside the precincts of the schoo: 
These provisions necessitated the formation of a medical depar} 
ment in the board of education, which was constituted in 19 
and has been extended and strengthened each following year. T 
first report of the chief medical officer or head of the departme!

            peared during the current year. The following particulars with 
spect to the service are taken from this document: 
The department has prepared three general circulars, which have been published 
the board and which are intended for the guidance and assistance of the local 
thorities. 
In the first of these, circular 576 (issued in November, 1907), the scope and pur- 
se of the act were explained, and especial stress was laid upon the need for the 
ordination in each area of the work of medical inspection under the control of the 
ool medical officer with the public health service. The value of and need for 
‘istance from the school nurse, the teacher, and the parents themselves was also 
plained, and suggestions were made for a schedule under which the actual work of 
pection might be carried out and as to the points with which the annual report of 
school medical officer might most profitably deal. Finally, the questicn of 
elioration and physical treatment was briefly discussed, and the directions in 
ich steps might provisionally be taken for acting on the initial results of medical 
pection were indicated. 
n circular 582 (issued in January, 1908) the suggestions contained in circular 576 
re developed into a formal schedule for medical inspection, in which the board 
icated the particulars, attention to which they regarded as constituting the mini- 
m of efficient inspection. This schedule has, almost without exception, either 
n adopted entirely by the local education authorities or has determined the 
ee and character of their inspection. 
inally, in circular 596 (issued in January, 1908), the position of the school medical 
cer and his relation to the medical officer of health were dealt with. The recom- 
mdations in circular 576 as to the plan which the school medical officer’s annual 
ort should follow were amplified and made more definite. Considerable space 
given to the question of the arrangements which might be made by the authority 
the treatment, as distinct from the inspection, of school children, and emphasis 
laid upon the necessity of coordinating in each educational area the work of the 
ious acts concerning school hygiene, sanitation, and the medical supervision of 
ctive or ailing children. 
ith regard to the extent to which local authorities have met the 
uirements of the law, the report says: 
p to the present—that is, up to the end of the education year 1908-9—there 
e been “‘recognized” by the board 307 school medical officers in 307 of the 328 
1 educational areas. In the remaining 21 areas medical inspection has been in 
tion, but for one reason or another the nominations made or the schemes sub- 
ed did not receive the board’s recognition or approval during the last code year. 
arrangements of some, however, of these 21 authorities will in all probability 
ive approval at an early date. The distribution of the 307 school medical officers 
roadly indicated by saying that in England school medical officers have been 
nized in 45 counties, 66 county boroughs, 132 municipal boroughs, and 42 urban 
icts; whereas in Wales such officers have been recognized in 6 counties (leaving 
unties still unprovided for), 4 county boroughs, 4 municipal boroughs, and 8 
n districts. 
224 out of the 307 areas for which a school medical officer is recognized the med- 
officer appointed was the medical officer of health of the area, and thus in the 
rity of cases a more or less complete unification of the two medical services was 
d. In England 30 of these officers holding both appointments occur in coun- 
41 in county boroughs, 101 in municipal borouchs, and 35 in urban districts. In 
s, as a whole, out of the 22 school medical officers recognized 17 are medical 
rs of health of the areas in which they work.

         It will be seen that the remaining 83 authorities have appointed a school medi 
officer who is not medical officer of health of the area. In 76 of these cases, howev 
the school medical officer is appointed either to be under the supervision of the m 
ical officer of health or directly to cooperate with him. Even in the remaining c: 
some degree of effective coordination, either personal or administrative, is the ru 
and upon this principle, so important in obtaining smooth and effective working, 
board have continued to lay emphasis. 
The experience of the service thus organized illustrates in a stri 
ing manner the vital relation between medical inspection of schoo 
taken in its most restricted sense, and considerations of ‘the ex 
nal sanitation of the school, the sanitation and hygiene of the ho. 
from which the child comes to school, and the whole business 
securing cleanliness.” 
In view of the wide ramifications of such a service in its full 
scope, the report reviews the various classes of work that are n 
going on in England under the direction of local authorities, looki| 
to the improvement of the physical condition of the children of 
poorer classes. The import of the entire work is summed up in 
conclusion of the report, as follows: 
Much of the work undertaken by the education authorities has originated un| 
the new act; some of it was in existence formerly, but has been strengthened 
systematized; all of it has been coordinated and correlated, or at least a begin: 
has been made in this direction. Much of this medical work is already of pro 
value, and the efforts which have been made in many areas have been beyond pra| 
Broad and simple foundations have been laid; to build upon them wisely 
patiently is the work of the future. 
On the whole, one must say, however, that what most strikes the careful obse: 
is that much remains to be done. The question of the physical condition of 
people is one of the most pressing and insistent national problems. This first yel 
work in medical inspection does not reveal nor can it reveal any new kind of f 
as to that condition, nor is it possible by any mental process or by any phys} 
measurement to determine from the findings resulting from medical inspec 
whether or not there is, in fact, physical deterioration. But one thing is cei 
that whatever be the academical or statistical value of medical inspection and sc 
hygiene generally, it is yielding a substantial result in practical reform. In al: 
all educational areas this new work is contributing to a wider knowledge of ¢ 
life than has been obtainable in the past, which can not fail to guide, encourage, 
foster the highest kind of social development. To this must be added the benefi 
results of medical treatment in tens of thousands of school children; nor can the 
ther fact be ignored that the increased attention devoted to school hygiene, inclu 
the whole health conditions and physical training of the child, is already begim 
to bear fruit in a better conception of the true ends of a state system of educatio} 
CARE COMMITTEES. 
The organization of care committees, under the general direc’ 
of local authorities, to look after the condition of necessitous chil 
attending the schools is one of the most interesting signs of 
awakening of the public conscience of England with. respect 
responsibility for the social welfare of the people. The dutie 
these committees and their relation to the education authori 
 
-P-A-G-E-517

are illustrated by the following extract from the latest report by 
Doctor Kerr, medical officer of the education committee for London: 
        
                                                    
      
   
    
   In April, 1909, the council decided to reorganize the care committees, which had 
originated two years previously in connection with the feeding of necessitous children 
in schools. These committees, when they become effective, can be of the greatest 
utility in following up much of the work concerning the physical condition of child- 
hood. They will take an interest in all matters concerning the physical good of the 
children, coordinating all agencies bearing on this work outside the school. The 
work will be of interest and the utmost social importance, but will require much 
self-sacrifice and trouble on the part of these committees and ultimately an almost 
expert knowledge. Excepting certain special schools for physically defective, blind, 
or deaf children, the scheme as revised is intended to cover all schools. A children’s 
care (school) committee is appointed for each school, and deals with the individual 
cases. The members will endeavor to procure cleansing, medical treatment,-or 
amelioration of existing physical conditions of all children referred to by the doctors 
or nurses in the medical report book of the school, penetrating to the homes and 
endeavoring to influence more particularly the indifferent parents who do not attend 
to see the doctor and whose children are the difficult cases in which to obtain improve- 
ment. In cases where the usual official routine appears to offer no solution, the 
personal influence of members of the committee often finds a way. They have also 
the duty of determining which children are necessitous, and perhaps in this is the 
greatest difficulty of maintaining a standard. To help toward this and also to look 
after general principles and financial questions, 27 local associations of care com- 
mittees have been formed, with representatives of the school committees, the teach- 
ers’ consultative committees, and the children’s care (central) subcommittee. They 
practically standardize the work of their district and report to the children’s care 
(central) subcommittee, consisting of 12 members, and dealing with the adminis- 
tration of the education (provision of meals) act, 1906; section 13 (1) (a) of the edu- 
cation (administrative provisions) act, 1907; and section 58 of the children act, 1908, 
so that all matters concerning medical treatment or the amelioration of physical 
conditions will come under this subcommittee, whose importance in the future will 
be increasingly great. 
EFFICIENCY OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
In a paper on ‘‘The relation of science to industry and commerce,” 
which has attracted wide attention, Mr. R. Blair, education officer, 
ondon county council, presented striking testimony as to the value 
lof the elementary schools of England, drawn from answers to inquiries 
hat he had sent out, from many leading industrial and commercial 
rms of England. 
Under the head of ‘‘Elementary-school training,” Mr. Blair says: 
Almost all [the firms] explain their preference for elementary-school boys in such 
way as to pay a well-deserved compliment directly to the adaptability of the ele- 
entary-school boy and indirectly to the existing system of elementary education. 
good many speak in high terms of the value of evening schools, including technical 
stitutes and schools of art. Banks and insurance almost invariably (but other 
rms as well) seek for the secondary-school product. There is some call for the man 
rained at the highest institutions, but this call is so much confined to firms the works 
x business of which require technical skill that it is fully evident that the others 
o not yet feel the need for such men nor know how to use them. There appears,

also, with some frequency, the traditional fling at the public schools and at the 
universities. 
Catch the boy as he leaves the elementary school and induce him to attend evening 
classes; add to that the training of the workshop or the business house, and you have 
the fairly common plan of training those who will rise above the rank of ‘‘hands.”’ 
From the best of these come the foremen; from those in turn the submanagers are 
selected, and so on. It is interesting to see, however, that the possibility of a change 
is not unforeseen. ‘‘It happens,’’ says one of our greatest industrial leaders, ‘‘that 
at the present moment all the men who fill the positions of responsibility in our office 
come from elementary schools. Naturally, they belong to a period when secondary 
schools were not so accessible as now, and probably the same remark may not be 
applicable to their successors.’’¢ 
     
      
   
    
          
    
        
         SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
By the act of 1899 creating the board of education the province 
of this central authority was extended to secondary schools, and 
regulations were at once issued defining the conditions under which 
secondary schools might have the benefits of government inspection| 
and receive grants from the public treasury. The recent develop- 
ment of this branch of the service is shown by the following statistics:

England; but there were also, on a rough estimate, ‘from 450 to 50 
schools educating between 60,000 and 70,000 pupils,’ which woul

RELATION TO THE TRAINING OF PUPIL TEACHERS. 
The secondary schools are brought into immediate relation with 
lhe work of public elementary schools by the system of pupil-teacher 
raining recently adopted. 
Year by year the secondary schools have taken a larger share in 
is work, and in 1908, of 615 centers at which pupil teachers were 
eing trained, 453 formed integral parts of secondary schools and 17 
ere centers attached to schools of that grade, or a total of 470 
lenters out of 615, as compared with 288 centers out of a total of 
82 in 1906. 
INSPECTION. 
The general results of the service of inspection maintained by the 
loard in the interests of secondary schools may be inferred from the 
lowing citations from the report covering the year 1908-9: 
Since the institution in 1901 of inspection of secondary schools by the board, 1,054 
condary schools have been fully inspected up to the end of the year 1908-9. Each 
these inspections means that a thorough survey of the whole organization and work 
the school, including its management and finance as well as its teaching, is made 
d recorded for the use of the school itself, of the board, and in all, except a few cases, 
the local education authority responsible for the development and support of higher 
ucation in the area. This figure does not include any instances of second or third 
pections of the same school. These are given below. All these schools, whether 
receipt of grant or not, have had their efficiency and work carefully tested, and have 
eived counsel, warning, or encouragement. A second inspection held a few years 
er often shows that the first has had very beneficial results. 
large part of the field of secondary education has thus been systematically surveyed 
the first time in modern English history. That survey still goes on being extended, 
ith as regards schools which are being created or reconstituted, and as regards existing 
ools, both public and private, which apply at their own instance for inspection and 
ognition by the board. But, apart from any large increase under either head (which 
lalways possible), the limit for the present appears to have been nearly reached. 
is is shown by the following table, giving the figures (including pupil-teacher cen- 
as well as secondary schools) for the last four years:

OFFICIAL REGULATIONS. 
1904 the board wholly recast their regulations for secondary schools, endeavored 
iscourage early specialization by insisting on a sound general education up to the 
of 16 at least, and required that the curriculum should provide duly graded and 
tinuous instruction in such subjects as are necessary for a well-balanced education. 
sequent modifications of the regulations have kept the same object in view and   
 
-P-A-G-E-520
  
  512 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
have provided more fully than was at first thought possible for elasticity in the scoy 
and contents of the school course and for the encouragement of local initiative i 
meeting the varying requirements of different areas and in making the fullest use « 
existing means. A large amount of liberty is allowed in framing curricula accordir 
to the requirements of the area and to the aim which the particular school sets befo: 
itself, and the aim of the board is to encourage experiment and a healthy variation 
type. 
All improvements of curriculum depend on the establishment of proper schools wi 
a satisfactory age of entry, an adequately prolonged school life, and a sufficient a: 
efficient staff. Unless we have these, no large improvements in curriculum are p: 
sible. The efforis of the board toward improvement in these respects are now bei: 
warmly supported by many local authorities. An impediment to efficiency special 
noted in the report of the royal commissioners was the unduly large size of class 
In 1906 the board introduced a regulation forbidding grant-earning secondary schor 
to have classes containing more than 35 pupils, and fixing the normal maximum at 
By subsequent regulations they have made it clear that classes of between 30 and 
are only allowed as an exceptional arrangement in order to meet special or tempo: 
difficulties of classification. A better scale of salaries for assistant masters and 
tresses has been secured, at any rate, in London and in many other parts of the counti 
and there is evidence of a marked and general improvement in teaching methods 
to the great interest in the study of teaching as an art. 
Every year shows improvement both in the age at which pupils enter the sch 
and the time for which they remain at it. But much still remains tobe done. Th 
were about 20 per cent of the schools on the grant list for 1907-8 which had hai 
secondary school existence of at least three years, in which the average school lif 
the pupils leaving within that year was not over two years. The board are tak 
steps to enforce, where necessary, the definition of a secondary school laid dow: 
article 2 of the regulations as regards the normal length of school life and nor 
leaving age. Several authorities have adopted with effective results rules by w 
the parents of children applying for admission to a secondary school enter into 
undertaking (in some cases under penalty) to keep the children at school either 
the full school course or for a named minimum period, unless for some appro 
reason. A notable instance occurred in one of the larger county boroughs in 
north of England. There, in order to cope with what was described by the boa: 
inspectors as a flooding of the schools with pupils who leave after a year or two yea! 
the most, and the consequent waste in great part of the strenuous effort and lib 
expenditure of the local education authority, the authority have lowered the ag} 
candidates for their junior scholarships to between 10 and 12, have required an un 
taking that pupils admitted to the schools shall not leave before the end of the sc 
year following their fifteenth birthday, have established a system of mainten: 
allowances in suitable cases extending to the completion of the school course, and, 
call for the repayment of fees remitted and maintenance allowances made in the 
of pupils who, without sufficient reason, fail to complete the full period for whic!

     The board of education are fully alive to the dangers atten 
central control, dangers which have been dwelt upon by many 
masters of typical secondary schools of England (the endowed pu 
schools) and which have excited more or less opposition to the 
ernment intervention in the province of secondary education. 
board have recently been at much pains to reassure the publi 
this point. They say in their latest report: 
The entire lack of organization commented on by the royal commission has 
given place temporarily to a state of things in which there is a risk of organiz)

swallowing up everything else; * * * the tendency ‘“‘to an imposed uniformity 
with a consequent discouragement of local and personal initiative and an absence of 
elasticity in the adaptation of schools to the special circumstances and to what may 
be called the specific genius of their own area.” 
As a means of guarding against these dangers, the fullest freedom is allowed under 
their regulations consistently with real efficiency in the education that is provided. 
Moreover, in addition to the general increase of elasticity which they have always 
kept in view as desirable and have found themselves able to give in successive 
revisions of their regulations, a special provision has lately been made for encouraging 
by means of a specific grant any carefully devised educational experiments of a 
pioneer and promising nature in methods of teaching. Several applications for this 
special grant have been made; so far it has been given in respect of two objects: (1) The 
mew oral method of teaching the ancient languages, and (2) the interchange, under 
rrangements come to between the board and the education ministries of France and 
russia, of French or German teachers with English teachers.

   The freedom of school authorities in initiating special types of curriculum and 
rganization, or new experiments in method, must always, in the case of schools 
largely maintained through the board’s grants, be to some extent limited by their 
aving to obtain the board’s previous approval. 
It is interesting to note the opinion that ‘‘there is much more disposition in the case 
f girls’ schools than in schools for boys to favor experiments and give free play to 
resh ideas.”” * * * ‘The board have increased their staff of women inspectors to

UNIVERSITY EDUCATION. 
The board of education publishes annually a bluebook containing 
jhe reports from the universities and university colleges to which 
lhe board disburses the annual parliamentary grant, amounting at 
resent to £100,000 ($500,000), for ‘‘university colleges in Great 
ritain,’’ and from three colleges in Wales, to each of which an 
nnual grant of £4,000 ($20,000) is made. The report for 1908-9, 
e latest issued, is introduced by a statement signed by the president 
f the board, Mr. W. Runciman, which sums up the main facts brought 
ut in the several reports and thus offers a comprehensive view of 
e modern aspects of university education in the Kingdom. 
The following statement is abridged from this presentation:   In the last ten years no fewer than five new universities have been founded in 
ingland, but the progress of institutions of older date has been no less marked. In 
'y, 1909, King Edward VII laid the foundation stone of important new laboratories 
ir the Imperial College of Science and Technology, a college for the highest studies 
pure and applied science, which was inaugurated by royal charter in July, 1907, and 
formed by the union under asingle governing body of the Royal College of Science, 
e Royal School of Mines, and the City and Guilds’ Central Technical College. In 
e following October the new buildings of the University College of South Wales and 
mmouthshire were opened at Cardiff, and on that occasion the present King, as 
ancellor of the University of Wales, wrote words which apply equally to all the 
iversities of England and Wales when he said, “We must look ahead and endeavor 
be ready to meet all the requirements of scientific and intellectual progress. The

   imperative necessity for higher education and research is becoming more and more 
recognized.”” 
This encouragement to further effort has been tangibly supported by the Govern- 
ment. Acting upon the report of a special committee of inquiry, under the chairman- 
ship of Sir Thomas Raleigh, K. C. 8. I., the treasury, by a minute dated December 18, 
1909, made an increased annual grant of £15,000 to the University of Wales and its 
constituent colleges. Of thissum £1,500 has been specially allocated to the Medical] 
School of Cardiff and another £1,500 a year has been assigned to the university itse 
for the foundation of research fellowships. 
The treasury has also made a capital grant of £20,000 toward the cost of the ne 
buildings for the University College of North Wales, Bangor. 
State aid to university teaching would, however, be of doubtful advantage if it di 
not stimulate private effort and induce benefactors to contribute in the present day 
as they did in the olden times, to give of their wealth for the support of that highe 
learning upon which now, more than ever, “the prosperity, even the very safety an 
existence, of our country depend.” 
The board is glad to find that there is no evidence of the springs of private beneficenc 
failing, but rather that the growing national sense of the vital need of universities h: 
impressed many of those, whether individuals or corporations, who are in the positio: 
to help. The following are some of the more important gifts made during the las 
twelve months: 
Sir Alfred Jones, the well-known shipowner, who died in 1909, and who during hi 
life had founded the School of Tropical Medicine in connection with the Universit 
of Liverpool, left to his trustees the sum of more than £500,000 upon trust for suc! 
charitable purposes and objects in England (or any British possession on the we: 
coast of Africa) as they may in their absolute discretion think fit. For the guidance 
of his trustees, however, he made suggestions as to the purposes to which the mone; 
might be applied, and amongst them were the advancement, benefit, or support 
education or science, and original research of all kinds in the cause of disease on 1] 
west coast of Africa. 
Mr. Otto Beit, in December, 1909, gave £215,000 for the endowment of thirty medic: 
research fellowships of £250 a year, each tenable for three years. The fund is 
be entirely devoted to the furthering of medical research work, which is to be coi 
ducted, with a few exceptions, in institutions allied to London University. T 
fellowships are open to any man or woman of European descent who is a graduate 
any approved university within the British Empire. 
The late Dr. Charles Graham, who died in November, 1909, and had been since 18: 
emeritus professor of chemical technology at University College, London, bequeath 
his residuary estate to London University, to be applied to the promotion of resear 
at University College Hospital Medical School “for the prevention, cure, or alleviati 
of human disease or suffering.’? The legacy was estimated at £35,000. 
Still more recently, M. Albert Kahn, a well-known French philanthropist, 
handed over to a board of six trustees a sum of £4,140 to provide for the annual awa: 
of two traveling fellowships, each of the value of £660. It is expressly desired 
him that the trust shall be permanently associated with the University of Londo} 
The fellows, who must travel for atleast twelve months, according to an itinerary re; 
| lated and prescribed by the trustees, will be elected by the trustees on the nominati 
of the vice-chancellor or other executive head of each of the universities in the Uni 
Kingdom, the president of the Royal Society, and the president of the British Ac: 
emy. M. Kahn has provided funds sufficient for a period of three years, and is p: 
pared at the expiry of that time to endow the fellowships in perpetuity if they sho 
prove to fulfill the objects which he desires. 
Mr. Alexander Elder gave, in 1909, asum of £20,000 as endowment for a chair 
naval architecture in the University of Liverpool, and Mr. W. H. Lever, of the

     ff Lever Brothers, Port Sunlight, in March, 1910, made a gift of £91,000 to the same 
mniversity for the erection of a building in which the School of House and Town 
lanning could be accommodated, and also the School of Architecture, and for assist- 
nce to the School of Tropical Medicine and the School of Russian Studies. 
City companies and corporate bodies have also made new contributions to the 
pport of university education during the last year. The Goldsmiths’ Company, 
ho had already been generous benefactors of university education in London, made 
gift in May, 1909, of £50,000 toward the cost of the new engineering buildings of the 
perial College of Science and Technology referred to above. The Drapers’ Com- 
lany made a further grant of £10,000 to the building fund of the new college at Bangor, 
be applied toward the library and museum of the college. The same company 
ake an annual grant of £7,000 to the East London College, which has been admitted 
r the first time this year to share, subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions, in 
e annual treasury grant made to university colleges. The company also grants 
holarships in connection with this college to the annual value of £1,555. 
As evidence of the realization on the part of the universities of 
eir ‘joint responsibility to the national life,” the report notes that 
steps have already been taken toward the mutual recognition of 
eir various matriculation examinations, and the northern uni- 
rsities of Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, and Sheffield have, under 
eir charters, established a joint matriculation board which con- 
cts a single examination of all candidates for admission to any 
e of the four universities;’’ and, further, the movement ‘for a 
gular interchange of views, and for the better organization of facili- 
s for advanced study throughout the Empire.” With this pur- 
se in view, the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and London have 
ited in inviting “the universities of the Empire to a conference to 
held in the metropolis in 1912.” 
The following statistics, taken from Mr. Runciman’s summaries, 
clude all the institutions participating in the parliamentary grant 
ich affects, “directly or indirectly, every university in England 
d Wales, except the two ancient foundations of Oxford and Cam- 
ridge.”’

EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 517 
The total expenditure for the universities and colleges of England, 
in the above table, amounted to £530,267, and the expenditure for the 
three colleges in Wales to £52,221. Of the total expenditure for the 
English institutions, 66.6 per cent was applied to the remuneration of 
teachers, 11.5 per cent to the maintenance of buildings, and about 10 
per cent to administration. The corresponding proportions for the 
colleges of Wales are 65.6 per cent for the teaching corps, 8.3 per cent 
for maintenance of buildings, and 13.5 per cent for administration. 
All the institutions maintain scholarships, the expenditure for this 
purpose representing, in the English institutions, 4.3 per cent of the 
total expenditure, and in the Welsh institutions, 7.2 per cent.

  518 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
REFORM AT OXFORD. 
     
                      
     
        
   
    
    
   
    
   
    
     
     The memorandum on the ‘‘Principles and methods of university 
reform,” published by Lord Curzon, as chancellor of Oxford, in April, 
1909, which was briefly noticed in the previous report of this series,? 
has been the subject of careful consideration by the hebdomadal 
council of the university during the intervening time, and the result 
of their deliberations has just been published in a report, with an 
introduction by the chancellor.’ The report embodies a scheme of 
reform in the directions advised originally by Lord Curzon, so far as 
these have met the approval of the council. The scheme is now 
before the legislative authority of Oxford (congregation), where it 
will undoubtedly be the subject of protracted discussion and much 
modification; but even if it should be eventually rejected the scheme 
affords a most significant index of the spirit that is moving in the 
intellectual center of tradition and conservatism. 
In the main the scheme deals with the constitution and adminis- 
trative machinery, and, so far, its chief interest to the outside worl 
lies in the purpose relating to congregation—namely, “to conve 
that body into an assemblage consisting of the teaching and admin: 
istrative elements in the university and the colleges, with due regar 
to existing interests, and to consider whether it may be desirable t 
provide for the inclusion of any other elements.” 
The propositions of general interest to the scholastic world embod. 
ied in the scheme are: The abolition of Greek as a compulsory su 
ject for the degree in arts; the introduction of a course of stud. 
suited to the requirements of a business career, with the sanction o 
a special diploma; the admission of women to degrees; and increase: 
provision for poor students. 
The grounds for the conclusions of the council are set forth in th 
introduction to the report by Chancellor Curzon, whose concludin; 
words expressing the prompting motive of the measure are as follow: 
We want Oxford to remain what it is, but to become, if it may be, better; still 
keep alive the transmitted flame, but to see that it illumines every corner of t) 
temple of knowledge and is accessible to all sections of the community. Above al 
since our university is an imperial training ground for character and intellect, 
arrange that the scheme of life, which produces the former, is worthy and sound, a: 
that the scheme of instruction, which develops the latter, is comprehensive a 
efficient.

EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AND WALES. 519 
April 28 of the present year. The report deals almost entirely with 
matters special to the university, and is, therefore, of little general 
moment at this purely tentative stage of the proceedings. The dis- 
cussion at the meeting referred to, however, disclosed certain points 
of view, ideals even, in the minds of leading members of the univer- 
sity, full of suggestion for the leaders of higher education in all coun- 
tries. In a warning against excessive mercenary influences in uni- 
versity administration, uttered by Mr. Glover, of the university, ref- 
rence was made to our own country, which is interesting, in spite 
f its exaggerations. 
Mr. Glover said, in substance, as reported:    
   
   
   
     
   
            
     
      
       
    
   They lived in very interesting times, when the administrative man was looming 
ery large. One always remembered with comfort what Mr. Cecil Rhodes said 
bout the university administrative man. But he thought there was a real danger 
ere that the teacher would be crowded out, as he was apt to be in the American 
miversity. The real enemy of education in America, and to some extent in Canada, 
as the principal of the university. He was, generally speaking, not selected because 
e was distinguished in letters or science or research; he was chosen because he was an 
dmirable business man, very much as if Cambridge were to go to Marshall and Snel- 
rove for a vice-chancellor; and, so far as his observation went, what the American 
rincipal looked at primarily was not education, not research, but at the next col- 
lege, the rival in the next university. Were they getting a larger entry? Would 
this proposal to raise standards lower the entry? That happened all over, and he 
lhought it regrettable. It seemed to him that businesslike people always thought 
that kind of way. This university was a place of sound learning and religious 
ducation, at least it was supposed to be, and he should like to see the people who 
ere really most deeply concerned with education and with research kept in the 
laces of responsibility. Professors might not be wishful, he understood, to go on 
e council of the senate, but he thought they ought to, and that they ought to be 
ept there.

So many changes are taking place at present over the whole field 
Scotch education, from the elementary schoo! to the university, 
at it is very difficult to deal with recent developments in the 
urse of a brief article, and therefore some parts of the subject 
ust remain without adequate treatment.

  522 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
THE ACT OF 1908. 
It will perhaps be easiest to begin by taking the education (Scot- 
land) aet of 1908 as the basis of a description of what is going on, 
although it will be necessary to deal with many matters which are 
not included within the covers of that act. 
Prior to the passing of the act Scotland had been waiting for an 
education act for many years, and bills had been brought in by 
more than one government, but had never been passed into law. 
This was largely due to the fact that there was great division of 
opinion in Scotland as to the best scheme of organization for dealing; 
with elementary education. One party was in favor of keeping to 
the existing system, under which each parish or burgh has its school} 
board for dealing with elementary education—a system which has| 
resulted in the small country of Scotland, with its population o 
some four or five millions, possessing altogether 1,068 school boards, 
Although this system is doubtless a wasteful one, it is based upo 
certain traditions linked up with the old Scotch parish school an 
has certainly many strong advocates among those in high places. 
There were, again, those who wished to see the control of elementar 
as well as of secondary education put under education committee: 
of the county councils. These county councils, which have at pre 
ent to deal with many matters outside the sphere of education, suc! 
as roads and bridges, have been intrusted in England by the ac 
passed by Mr. Balfour’s government in 1902 with the control o: 
elementary education, and there can be no doubt that, apart fro 
the question of the religious and political quarrels, this act of 190: 
has proved a success and has done much to coordinate and develo, 
elementary education in England. Again, there were those wh 
wished to have larger areas than the present school-board areas, bu 
who held the view that the education authority should be a bod, 
elected to deal with education only. 
We are accustomed in Scotland to fight to the death for oul 
opinions, and consequently this division of opinion as to the bes| 
method of organizing the control of elementary education led t 
lukewarmness on the part of the various governments and to th 
dropping of the various bills which had been introduced. 
In addition there was, and is still, a strong feeling in Scotland i 
favor of some form of local council for dealing with education: 
matters. Under the present system there are several Scotch depar 
ments with permanent officials dealing entirely with Scotch affair: 
and of these the Scotch education department is only one. 
these departments are represented in Parliament by the secreta: 
for Scotland. The English system of government, by which ea 
great state department is administered by a body of permane 
officials under a temporary chief appointed by the party in pow

       at the time, works well on the whole, as the public can always attack 
the administration of any department through its appointed chief; _ 
ut in the case of Scotland, as there is a representative dealing with 
ll the Scotch departments instead of one representative for each 
epartment, it is more difficult for public opinion, through the 
ouse of Commons, to be brought directly in touch with the perma- 
ent officials; and, further, as the Scotch education department itself 
s actually located in London, it is in reality an independent and 
owerful bureaucracy. Moreover, the Scotch members of Parlia- 
ent have never shown that capacity for united action in defense of 
cotch interests which we are so familiar with in the case of the 
epresentatives of the sister nation of Ireland. They are usually 
en of ambition and great ability, and consequently if the member- 
hip of the British cabinets is examined it will be found that for 
any years Scotchmen have played a much larger part in governing 
he Empire than is actually warranted by the size of the population 
f Scotland. The best of them are therefore busily engaged in 
perial affairs. For all these reasons there has been a strong party 
Scotland for many years who are in favor of something of the 
ature of a council to deal with educational affairs in Scotland and 
vho also urge that this council should sit in Scotland. At the same 
e the creation of such a council involves great constitutional 
ifficulties, as its relation to the House of Commons, to the secretary 
r Scotland, and the permanent officials of the education department 
difficult to decide. It is rather of the nature of a pious wish than 
a well-thought-out scheme. 
Under its present chief, the Scotch education department has been 
ministered with such ability and has shown such vitality that there 
no immediate necessity of dealing with this question. In fact, it is 
much of the nature of the Scottish character to split into small 
d fiercely fighting groups on every question involving a difference 
opinion that a little despotic control by a minister removed 400 
iles from Scotland and safely ensconced in an office in Whitehall 
s no doubt been much to the advantage of Scottish education. 
ut those of us who are connected with the educational matters and 
e how the beneficent control of the present chief of the Scotch 
ucation department is permeating through every branch of Scottish 
ucation, tremble to think what the consequences would be if some 
y we found sitting in the chair in Whitehall, at present so ably 
cupied, a man of the usual civil-servant type, bound in formality 
d incapable of ideas. 
NATURE OF THE ACT OF 1908. 
For these many reasons, then, the passage of a Scotch education 
t was delayed from year to year, and finally the act of 1908, while 
most interesting document, has left severely alone the question of 
 
-P-A-G-E-532
  
   
   
           
     
      
     
     
    
       
   
           
      
    524 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
the organization of the controlling body. The school boards are left 
where they were, with a considerably increased power, and in place 
of the technical and secondary education committees of the county 
councils, new secondary education committees have been created, 
consisting of representatives of the town councils, the county councils, 
and of the school boards; and the duty of providing continuation| 
elasses for children who have left school, which was in some cases 
formerly carried out by the education committees of the county] 
councils, has been thrown upon the school boards. While, therefore, 
practically no changes of great importance have been made in th 
organization and control of Scotch education, the tendency of th 
act of 1908 has been to throw more responsibility on the schoo! 
boards than they had to bear before, and it is therefore rather a: 
dealing with the internal details of education that this act is of suc 
great importance. We shall now proceed to touch upon one or tw 
of the actual sections of the act. 
MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOL CHILDREN. 
In the first place, some of the most important sections of the act ar 
those dealing with the medical inspection of school children and wit 
neglected school children. 
Clause IV reads as follows: 
A school board may, and where required by the department shall, provide for th 
medical examination and supervision of the pupils attending schools within their dis 
trict to such extent and subject to such requirements as may from time to time b 
prescribed by any code or minute of the department, and for the purposes of this se 
tion the school boards may employ medical officers or nurses, or arrange with voluntar 
agencies for the supply of nurses, and provide appliances or other requisites. * * 
The department has exercised its compulsory powers under thi 
clause, and the medical inspection of school children is introduce: 
into Scotland for the first time, and schemes have been framed a! 
over the country for this purpose. It may perhaps be sufficient 4] 
describe one scheme as adopted by a particular county, viz, that 
Midlothian, which has some 20,000 school children scattered throug| 
small towns and villages, as giving an idea how the clause works out i 
practice. The new county committees on secondary education, whi 
have been already referred to and which have been appointed 
schemes drawn up by the Scotch education department since t 
passing of the act, have been intrusted in conjunction with the scho 
boards with the drawing up of schemes and have also power to p 
half the salary of a medical officer. The Midlothian county committ 
on secondary education therefore approached the various scho 
boards and suggested the drawing up of a scheme by which t 
expenses of such medical inspection should be shared, and thus t 
total cost of the inspection ordered by the Scotch education depai
-P-A-G-E-533
EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN SCOTLAND. 525 
ment diminished. The county council already had a medical officer 
of its own, who had to deal with the various provisions under the acts 
dealing with public health and sanitation, including the sanitation of 
schools, and therefore a scheme was drawn up by which the existing 
chief medical officer for the county was also made responsible for the 
medical inspection of the school children (receiving an honorarium 
f £60 from the county committee). Another medical man was 
appointed to be assistant to the chief medical officer at a salary 
f £250 per annum, a trained nurse was appointed at £80 per 
nnum, while there is an allowance of £100 for traveling expenses, 
50 for apparatus, and £100 for clerical assistance, making a total 
xpenditure in Midlothian on the medical inspection of school 
hildren of £640. The county of Peebles, which is a thinly 
opulated county, joined with Midlothian in this scheme. The 
ssistant medical officer has already been engaged in going round the 
chools inspecting the children and preparing a report on the first 
esults of his work, and it is already evident that more assistance will 
e required if the work is to be efficiently carried out. It may there- 
re be roughly estimated that the cost of the medical inspection of 
chool children for a county consisting of scattered villages and small 
wns and with some 20,000 children will be at least £640 a year and 
robably more. One of the most interesting and complete reports 
hich has been published in connection with this new movement is 
the medical officer of the Carnegie Dunfermline trust.      
    
      
           
    
    
    
     
    
   
    
    
     
   
    
    
    FEEDING AND CARE OF SCHOOL CHILDREN AND NEGLECTED CHILDREN. 
The next clauses of great interest are Clause III, subsection (2), 
hich deals with the provision of accommodation, apparatus, equip- 
ent, and service for the preparation and supply of meals to school 
ildren, and Clause VI, which deals with neglected children. It is 
0 early yet to say what the full effect of these clauses will be, but 
ey must profoundly influence the future of all children in the 
untry who belong to the more poverty-stricken classes, while their 
aring and scope, and the way in which they are being dealt with by 
e larger school boards, can best, perhaps, be shown by quoting from 
eport of a committee of the school board of Edinburgh, which has 
en appointed to deal with the question. 
This report begins by dealing with the statutory position in the 
lowing terms: 
THE STATUTORY POSITION. 
e parts of the 1908 act concerned with the question under discus- 
n are as follows: 
ECTION 3. Itshall be lawful fora school board, if they think fit, * * * toincur

) In providing accommodation, apparatus, equipment, and service for the prepara- 
and supply of meals to pupils attending schools within their district, provided
-P-A-G-E-534
  526 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
that no expense incurred in the purchase of food prepared and served at such meals 
shall be defrayed out of the school fund, except as hereinafter provided. 
Sxrction 6. (1) When as the result of medical inspection or otherwise it is brought 
to the notice of a school board that a child attending a school within their district is in 
a filthy or verminous state, or is unable by reason of lack of food or of clothing to take 
full advantage of the education provided, it shall be the duty of the school board, after 
due warning, to summon either or both of the parents or the guardian of such child to 
appear before them to give an explanation of the child’s condition, and if the schoo 
board shall find that such explanation is not forthcoming or is insufficient or unsatis 
factory, and that the condition of the child is due to neglect, they shall transmit a cop 
of such finding to the parent or parents or guardian of the child and to the procurator- 
fiscal, and it shall be the duty of the procurator-fiscal to institute a prosecution unde! 
the subsection immediately following. 
(2) Without prejudice to the general operation of the prevention of cruelty to chil 
dren act, 1904, or any act amending the same, neglect to exercise due care of a chil 
as aforesaid shall be deemed wilful neglect, likely to cause the child unneces: 
suffering within the meaning of such act, punishable summarily as an offense of cruelt; 
in terms of such act and subject to the provisions thereof as to the committal an 
custody of the child and otherwise: Provided, that if it shall be shown to the satisfac 
tion of the school board, or in the event of a prosecution under such act of the sheri: 
that such parent or parents or guardian are unable by reason of poverty or ill health 
supply sufficient and proper food or clothing for the child or to give the child the nece: 
sary personal attention, the school board, if satisfied that the necessities of the casi 
will not be provided for by voluntary agency, shall make such provision for the chil 
out of the school fund as they deem necessary during such period while the child 
under obligation to attend school as they may determine. But it is hereby provide 
that any aid given in terms of this section shall not deprive such parent or guardian 
any franchise, right, or privilege, or subject him to any disability: Provided also, th: 
the school board, where they deem it necessary, owing to the condition of the chil 
shall have power to make temporary provision for the child out of the school fun 
pending the completion of the procedure hereby prescribed, and to recover the c 
of such provision from such parent or guardian as an alimentary debt, unless it is sho’ 
to the satisfaction of the school board that such parent or guardian was unable, 
reason of poverty or ill health, to supply sufficient and proper food or clothing for 
child, or to give the child the necessary personal attention.    
          
      
    
    
      
   
      
    
              
   
   
      
    
   
   
      It will be seen that section 3 (2) is permissive, while section 6 
mandatory, if certain conditions are satisfied. The substance of t 
sections in question may be classified as follows: 
(1) The power to supply apparatus, accommodation, equipment, and service, b) 
not food, for children attending schools within the district. 
(2) The duty to supply food to pupils attending schools in the district if the b 
is satisfied (a) that the pupil’s education is suffering from want of food; (b) that t] 
parents are necessitous; and (c) that voluntary effort will not provide for the nec 
sities of the case. These three conditions must jointly hold before the board ¢ 
pay for food. If they do so hold, then the board must provide the food. 
(3) The duty to institute, through the fiscal, prosecutions of parents in resp 
of whose children condition (a) above holds, but (b) is not satisfied. 
(4) The power to feed children shown to be suffering from want of food pendij 
investigation of the circumstances of the parent, and subject to recovery of cost 
nonnecessitous cases. 
The position of the board is that it has decided to exercise t 
optional powers referred to in (1). As regards the duties referr

       in (2) and (3), and the power referred to in (4), no action has yet 
een taken, but it is evident that the operation of medical inspection 
ow in full swing) and the customary evidence of underfeeding 
hich arises each winter will force the board on the need for carrying 
t its statutory duties under the act, subject to the limitations as 
gards the success of voluntary effort stated above. 
The report then proceeds to deal with the condition of the problem 
Edinburgh, and discusses the best means of carrying out the 
ties of the board under the act. They have decided in the first 
lace to establish a cooking center for the provision of meals in 
cordance with the powers conferred upon them under clause III, 
bsection (2) of the act. With reference to the condition of desti- 
te children in Edinburgh, there has existed for some years a chari- 
ble organization known as the Flora Stevenson fund, which pro- 
des meals and, if necessary, clothing, in necessitous cases. Under 
e act it will be noted that the school board is expected to take 
ll advantage of such voluntary agencies and, keeping that condi- 
m. in view, the following recommendations have been drawn up for 
e consideration of the school board: 
1) That the board having considered as to its duties in regard to the feeding of 
essitous children under the education (Scotland) act, 1908, are of opinion that a 
tral children’s care committee as described below would give valuable assistance 
carrying out the said duties. 
2) That accordingly such a committee be established for the purpose of (a) securing 
administering voluntary funds to be used in the payment of the cost of food 
necessitous children as prescribed in the act, (b) determining as to the need for 
fief in all cases where prima facie evidence of necessity is submitted, (c) unifying 
operations of charitable agencies in so far as these deal with the feeding of chil- 
m in attendance at schools within the district of the board. 
3) That the committee be composed of representatives of the board, of such societies 
voluntary agencies as are willing to cooperate with the board in the matter, and

) That a system of local children’s care committees be instituted for such groups 
chools as the board may hereafter determine, and that the duties of those com- 
tees be as follows: (a) To make recommendations to the central care committee 
0 the children who should be regarded as necessitous; (b) to manage andsuper- 
, subject to the board’s direction, the local arrangements for feeding; (c) to take 
in and have a general supervision over all the charitable and relief work which

e have thus had it clearly laid down that, on the one hand it is 
duty of the State through its educational organization not only 
teach the children, but to take care that they are properly fed and 
thed and living in a decent environment, and, on the other hand, 
is also the duty of the State to punish the parents or guardians 
compel them: to fulfill their duties. It is unnecessary to point 
to those who have studied social questions what far-reaching 
lts provisions of this kind must necessarily have.

   POST-ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. 
To pass from these questions to the arrangements for carrying o 
the education of children after they have passed the elementai 
stage, many interesting developments are taking place in Scotlan 
The age for leaving school in Scotland has since 1901 been 14, an 
this remains the same under the new act, with the exception that 
child who has reached the age of 14 during the school session is no 
required to complete the school term. During the last two years 
his school career he is supposed, if he is going on with the ordina: 
elementary education, to be in what is known as a supplementa! 
class. 
SUPPLEMENTARY COURSES. 
The idea is that this class, while continuing the general educati 
of the child, should at the same time impart to him a certain amou 
of specialized instruction in such directions as are likely to be usef 
in after life. The girls receive instruction in domestic economy, tl 
boys in the country schools get instruction in nature knowledge ai 
in gardening, and the boys in the town schools get instruction 
technical and commercial subjects. Here again these supplementa: 
classes are still too new to judge of their possible future developme 
Their success necessarily involves many other things, for instan 
the supply of specially trained teachers qualified to carry out t) 
special instruction, and up to the present time the supply of su 
teachers is most undoubtedly inadequate. It is probable, howev: 
that we see here the roots that will ultimately grow into some syst 
of trade schools similar to those existing on the Continent. 
HIGHER GRADE SCHOOLS. 
The child who wishes to receive an education more of the nat 
of a secondary education, either with a view to becoming a teac 
or with a view to ultimately passing on to the university, or mer 
for educational reasons, goes to certain selected schools known 
higher grade schools. To take, for instance, a local example 
higher grade schools, we have in the district of Colinton, which| 
within 3 or 4 miles of Edinburgh, a school board which has under 
control five elementary schools, and in connection with one of th 
schools there is provided what is known as a higher grade dep 
ment, which has to serve not only for the district of Colinton, w! 
its five elementary schools, but has also to supply the needs of 
neighboring school board area of Currie, the geographical posit: 
of Currie being such that children from that district can manage 
attend the higher grade school of the Colinton district. Here 
education of the children is carried on on broad lines, English, mal 
ematics, modern languages, science, and drawing forming part 
the curriculum, the final standard aimed at being that known as

   intermediate certificate, of which a full explanation will be given 
ater. 
When the large higher grade schools were first opened in the big 
owns such as Edinburgh, it was feared that they would compete 
vith the existing secondary school system, the children in the sec- 
ndary schools paying fees, while the children attending the higher 
rade schools receive their instruction free. This has not proved to 
e the case. Since the opening of the large higher grade schools in 
idinburgh, which are crowded with pupils, there has been no indi- 
ation that the secondary schools have in any way suffered. This 
is perhaps best shown by the returns of George Heriot’s school in 
Ndinburgh, because among the various secondary schools in the 
ity this school provides a secondary education for the lowest fees, 
nd the lines of the education given have always been—while classical 
languages have not been neglected—in the direction of modern lan- 
uages, the teaching of science and workshop instruction. If, 
lherefore, any school in Edinburgh was likely to feel the competition 
f the higher grade schools it should have been George Heriot’s 
chool. As an actual fact, in spite of the newer higher grade schools 
eing overcrowded with pupils, this school has had during the last 
© years a‘larger number of applicants seeking admission than it 
as been possible to accommodate, so that it is evident that the 
igher grade school in a big city is providing a secondary education 
meet a demand which did not exist before these schools were 
ened. 
Srconpary Epucation. 
To continue the subject of secondary education the Scotch educa- 
on department has been encouraging the teaching of modern lan- 
ages and the development of science teaching in secondary schools 
d the provision of the necessary equipment, and the result has been 
very large development in the teaching of science. The Scotch 
ucation department has also made use of its system of grants to 
condary schools to require other improvements, more especially the 
minution of the number of pupils per teacher, and these schools are 
ularly inspected by the department’s inspectors. 
LEAVING CERTIFICATES. 
But the most interesting of these developments is in connection 
th the leaving certificates which are granted by the department. 
e conditions of the leaving certificate have been gradually under- 
ing modification, and are still in process of development, but the 
esent position is as follows: The intermediate certificate is awarded 
pupils at the age of 15 or 16, who have had at least a three years’ 
urse of instruction, beyond the elementary school stage, in English,

a language other than English, mathematics, science, and drawing| 
and who satisfy the examiners of the department as to their profi 
ciency in these subjects, excellence in one subject compensating i 
some degree for deficiency in another. The leaving certificate i 
granted to pupils who have gone through a course of study lastin 
over two or more years after obtaining the intermediate certificat 
and who have reached the age of 17 or 18. Candidates for the lea 
ing certificate must have passed in four subjects on what is kno 
as the higher standard, or in three subjects on the higher standar 
and two on the lower standard, and among these subjects the pa: 
must include a higher English and either a higher or a lower in math 
matics. The remaining subjects may be either science with one 
more languages, or languages only, but where two or more languag 
other than English are taken, the group must include either high 
or lower Latin. These are the existing regulations. 
The Scotch education department proposes to modify these a: 
has asked the head masters of the secondary schools to draw 
schemes for leaving certificates of various kinds, for the considerati 
of the department. In a recent report made by the general coun 
of the University of Edinburgh there was included a report by a su 
committee on the question of the conditions of entranee to the u 
versities. This subcommittee consisted of some of the leading se} 
ondary schoolmasters in Scotland, and they pointed out that t 
department, having made this proposal regarding various groups f 
the leaving certificate to be drawn up, they wished to submit the f 
lowing groups as being such as the department would be likely 
accept, and at the same time such as would meet the wishes of t 
head masters. The subcommittee also suggested that if such grou 
were accepted by the Scotch education department, they should al 
be accepted by the university in lieu of the preliminary examinati 
required from those entering on a degree course. In that report 
was pointed out that the leaving certificate of the future will not, 
cording to the plan of the department, represent so definitely as t 
existing certificate a certain standard of attainment in a certain m 
or less fixed group of subjects, as one pupil may be awarded a leavi 
certificate on the successful completion of a course in which the m: 
subjects are Latin and Greek; another may be awarded, a leaving c 
tificate after a course in modern languages; and another after a cou 
inscience, andso on. The report goes on to say, ‘‘It may, we thi 
be assumed that the department will be prepared to award a leavi 
certificate on the completion of any approved course for a pass on 
higher grade standard in three subjects, one of the three subjects 
ing English, and further, that each approved course will make p 
vision for the study of at least four subjects.” This means that 
schoolmaster will be required to submit to the Scotch educati

department the course of study through which the pupil has been, and 
that that course will have to include four subjects, but that the student 
will be examined on three of them. The following, then, are samples 
lof such courses of study for the leaving certificate, drawn up by this 
ubcommittee of head masters, and they may be considered as repre- 
enting on the one hand the views of the leading head masters of the 
cotch secondary schools, and, on the other hand, as being probably 
qually acceptable to the Scotch education department.

LATIN OPTIONAL. 
Perhaps the most interesting fact to notice about these groups is, 
at it is possible in more than one of them, to leave out the study of 
latin altogether. The proposal is therefore definitely made that a 
y should be able to enter the university not only for a medical, 
ientific, or technical course without Latin, but also that he Shin 
able to enter upon his course for the degree of M. A. without Latin. 
e shall have to consider presently the changes that have been made 
cently in the curriculum for the degree of M. A. at the Scottish 
iversities, but in the meantime it is worth noting the reasons that 
fe given why these head masters have come to this decision. They 
int out that under the present regulations of the university, it is

   532 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
possible for a student to take the M. A. degree without includin; 
among his subjects the study of Latin, and consequently that th 
only demand made upon him is that he should pass an examinatio: 
in Latin at the university preliminary examination of a standard n 
higher than the pass in Latin required by the Scotch education depart 
ment for the intermediate certificate. That is to say that the uni 
versity on the one hand requires from the student for the M. A 
degree an amount of Latin that can be easily learned by a boy wh 
ceases to study the subject after the age of 15, and that it require: 
no more. Under these circumstances, these head masters think i 
would be far better to make Latin optional. It is unlikely that th 
universities will accept this suggestion, but it is significant of th 
general tendencies underlying secondary education in Scotland tha 
such a proposal should be made by those in responsible positions. 
It should also be mentioned that in connection with the leavin, 
certificate examinations the opinion of the head master is more an 
more being taken as to the qualifications of the pupil, while his scho 
record is also taken into account in addition to the actual examinatio 
CONTINUATION CLASSES IN THE COUNTIES. 
To return to the pupil who has attended a supplementary cour: 
at the elementary schools, and does not intend to pass on either 
the higher grade or the secondary school, it is important to no 
what provision is made for continuing his education. Let us assu: 
that on leaving school at the age of 14, he goes to work. The pr 
vision which is made for his further education has so far, in Scotlan 
taken the form almost entirely of evening classes. For the admi 
istration of these evening classes the Scotch education departme 
has drawn up a special code, known as the continuation classes cod 
and under the recent education act (Clause X) school boards ai 
required to provide such continuation classes in their respecti 
districts. 
To deal first with the country centers, this clause in the act mig 
have given rise to a certain amount of difficulty, as the technic 
instruction committees of the county councils which formerly existe 
and which had certain funds in their hands, had already, in a gre 
many cases, organized in Scotland a fairly complete system of eve! 
ing continuation classes, with peripatetic teachers, and it is evidel 
that such instruction in country districts is better to be in the han 
of some central body, each little country school board being qui 
unable to deal with this question.adequately. Fortunately, t 
school boards have recognized this fact, and the new secondary ed 
cation committees of the counties have taken over the former duti 
both of the technical and secondary education committees, and hai 
also taken over with them the organizing secretaries who had alrea 
 
-P-A-G-E-541

been appointed, and the teaching staffs. It has been found more 
economical for the local school boards to utilize these teaching staffs, 
and they have also found it of advantage to keep in touch with the 
organizing secretaries and get them to inspect the classes. The sec- 
ondary education committees have also got a special hold upon these 
classes, owing to the fact that they have the power to grant scholar- 
ships to take pupils from these local continuation classes to the 
central institutions, and that it depends upon the approval by the 
central institution of the instruction given in these classes that these 
scholarships are granted. As these central institutions are anxious 
to see something like a complete and uniform organization at work 
in the counties, the act has not resulted in the confusion that might 
have been expected, and practically the old organizing secretaries 
and the old machinery are at work under the new secondary educa- 
tion committees, developing on satisfactory lines the instruction 
provided in the evening continuation classes. 
     
                     
   
     
   
       
    
          
   
    
     
   
    
   
   CONTINUATION CLASSES IN THE CITIES. 
In the large towns, such as Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, and 
berdeen, the school boards have an elaborate system of evening 
lasses, which are directly affiliated to the evening classes held in the 
entral technical institutions, such as the Glasgow and West of Scot- 
and Technical College; the Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh; Robert 
ordon’s Technical College, Aberdeen; and the Technical Institute, * 
tundee. Courses of study have been drawn up by which the stu- 
ents obtain a course lasting over two to three years in the evening 
ontinuation classes held by the school board, and thereafter qualified 
upils pass on to the more advanced instruction provided in the 
entral institutions. I have not space here to discuss this system in 
etail, and can only deal with its general results. In Edinburgh, 
hich has a population of about 350,000, there are 8,800 students 
ttending the evening classes under the school board. To this 
umber must be added 3,000 students who are attending the evening 
lasses at the Heriot-Watt College, and 600 attending the evening 
lasses held at the Edinburgh College of Art, making a total of 12,400 
ds and girls under instruction. In Glasgow, which has a population, 
clusive of suburban burghs, of some 770,000, there were in 1907-8 
me 14,900 young people receiving further instruction in continua- 
on classes other than the central institutions, and 5,900 students 
ittending the central institutions, making a total of 20,800 students. 
t first sight these figures seem gratifying, but on analysis it can be 
sily shown that these large totals are made up principally of stu- 
nts who are in the more elementary stages, and that the leakage 
tween the elementary stages and more advanced stages is from 
ar to year enormous, while to a great extent the central institu-

tions, such as the Heriot-Watt College and the Edinburgh College 
of Art, are filled with a new class of students who enter on more 
advanced and specialized instruction straight from the secondary 
schools, and do not represent students who have carried on a con- 
tinuous course of instruction from the elementary classes of the 
school board to the more advanced classes conducted in the central 
institution. The following statistics for the whole of Scotland for 
1907-8 illustrate this very clearly:

The system is, of course, a voluntary one, and has the faults o 
such a voluntary system, while the fact that the instruction is give: 
in the evening is a serious drawback to its having full value, excep 
in the case of a few exceptional students who have the physique 
the determination, and the force of character to take full advantag 
of evening instruction after they have finished their day’s wor! 
There can be no doubt, therefore, that the question of the traini 
of the apprentice on German lines—that is to say, his training i 
day classes—is toming more and more to the front, and will have to b} 
faced sooner or later in Scotland. As an actual fact provision h 
already been made for this under the recent act. 
COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE AT CONTINUATION CLASSES. 
In the first place, the continuation-classes code is drawn up oJ 
such elastic lines that it can be utilized either for evening or for d: 
instruction, and, as was pointed out to me some years ago when 
was first published by the Scotch education department by thi 
department’s able chief, it is not an evening continuation-class 
code, but a continuation-classes code, with the word “evening’’ le} 
out. Under the new act a school board has the power, if it choos 
to make attendance at evening classes compulsory, but only on t 
condition, that the total number of hours that the young person 
employed at work or in receiving instruction shall not be more th 
the total number of hours of work allowed under the factory ac 
The clause referred to [Clause X, subsection (3)] reads as follows: 
It shall be lawful for a school board from time to time to make, vary, and rev 
bye-laws for requiring the attendance at continuation classes until such age, 
exceeding 17 years, as may be specified in the bye-laws, of young persons ab: 
the age of 14 years within their district who are not otherwise receiving a suita 
education, or are not specially exempted by the school board from the operat
-P-A-G-E-543
co eee oe EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN SCOTLAND. 535 
of the bye-laws, and that at such times and for such periods as may in such bye-laws 
be specified. Such bye-laws may also require all persons within the district having 
in regular employment any young person to whom such bye-laws apply to notify the 
same to the board at times specified in the bye-laws, with particulars as to hours 
during which the young person is employed by them.     
   
   
                        
    
            
      
     
     
    Subsection (5) of the same clause reads as follows: 
If any person fails to notify the school board in terms of any such bye-law in regard 
to young persons employed by him, or knowingly employs a young person at any 
time when his attendance is by any such bye-law required at a continuation class, 
or for a number of hours, which when added to the time required under any such 
bye-law to be spent at a continuation class causes the hours of employment and the 
time so spent taken together to exceed in any day or week, as the case may be, the 
period of employment permitted for such young person by any act of Parliament, 
he shall be liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding twenty shillings, 
or, in case of a second or subsequent offence, whether relating to the same or to 
another young person, not exceeding five pounds. 
Subsection (6) of the same clause imposes like penalties upon 
parents who, by willful default or habitual neglect, do not secure the 
attendance at continuation classes of their young people. 
We have here, on the one hand, the power to make continuation 
classes compulsory, and, on the other hand, a limitation of the hours 
in which the instruction must be obtained. It is evident that in all 
cases where lads and girls are now being worked to the full number 
of hours allowed by the factory acts, it is impossible to establish 
compulsory attendance at evening classes, but it is allowable, if nec- 
essary, to take the time for receiving instruction at continuation 
classes out of the time spent in the workshop, and in this way young 
people are safeguarded against overwork either on the part of their 
mployers or by the educational machine.   
DAY CLASSES FOR APPRENTICES. 
Day classes for apprentices are already developing tentatively in 
mgland, and have begun in Scotland, and it is probable that the 
ext few years will see a great development in this direction. 
BursARiEs. 
There is no country in the world that is so well provided as Scot- 
and with bursaries to enable students to attend universities and the 
econdary schools, and yet, in spite of this, there seems to be always 
demand for more bursaries. Among the duties which have been 
aid upon the new secondary education committees of the county 
ouncils under the education (Scotland) act, 1908, is that of pro- 
iding bursaries to enable students to come from the elementary to 
he intermediate schools, and again in providing bursaries to enable 
tudents to go to the central institutions, or to attend evening 
lasses, or to take them to the universities. They also have to pro- 
 
-P-A-G-E-544
  536 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
vide bursaries for those who are teachers in training in the higher 
grade schools and who will ultimately pass on to the Central Training 
College for Teachers. 
THE BURSARY SYSTEM AS IT Is. 
    
         
    
      
        
     
    
   
     
       
     So far the bursary system in Scotland has developed on the lines 
which obtain elsewhere; that is to say, that money originally designed 
for the purpose of enabling the poor but ambitious boy to obtain a 
higher education has finally fallen into the hands of the boy who 
does not require the money, but has the opportunity of getting such 
special teaching at the expense of the school or by means of coach- 
ing. This is notoriously so in the case of the Oxford and Cambridge 
scholarships, which in very few cases ever reach the class for which 
they were originally intended. 
THE BURSARY SYSTEM AS THE DEPARTMENT WISHES IT SHOULD BE. 
The department has determined to make an heroic effort to brea! 
through this as far as bursaries provided out of its moneys are con. 
cerned, and therefore they have laid down certain conditions for thi 
granting of these bursaries, and these conditions are of considerabl 
interest. 
In the first place the number of bursaries and their value is no 
fixed beforehand, but applications are invited from lads who wis 
either to go on with their secondary education or to attend a central 
institution. These lads are then required to fill up a form on whicl 
information is given not only as to their school career, but also as t 
the financial position of their parents. It is then the duty of th 
committee to find out in the first place from the headmaster of th 
school the order of merit of these students in respect of their attai 
ments. After having taken the reports on their attainments an 
their financial circumstances into full consideration, the committe 
grants such a number of bursaries and of such an amount as the. 
may think fit out of the funds they have to administer. There is n 
competitive examination and there is no fixed amount of bursar 
as the amount given is to be according to the need, and bursaries ai 
only to be given where the need exists. It is obvious that this is 
most interesting experiment and a most striking departure fro 
the traditional system in this country, where everything is given 
the results of a competitive examination. 
It will require the most careful and sympathetic administrati 
on the part of the various committees concerned, and to some 
those who are accustomed to old methods the scheme seems som 
what bewildering. How far it is being administered with the ne 
essary care it is too early to say, but from my own experience of 0 
committee I can certainly testify that the bursaries are being award

       with great care to those who require them and who can really make

This experiment, then, of the Scotch education department in 
rying to make their bursary system really fulfill the purpose for which 
ther bursary systems were designed, will be watched with interest

Centra. INSTITUTIONS. 
In the brief account I have already given of the continuation 
chool work, the central institutions for technical education have 
lready been referred to, but it is necessary to deal with these insti- 
utions more completely. 
In the first place, the two earliest institutions of the kind in Scot- 
and are the Heriot-Watt College, Edinburgh, and the Glasgow and 
est of Scotland Technical College, Glasgow; the former was origi- 
ally known as the Watt Institution and School of Arts and the 
tter as the Andersonian Institution. These institutions existed for 
lhe purpose of providing instruction in evening classes, and were 
nked up with the system of examinations carried on by the depart- 
ent of science and art. Day departments, in addition to the even- 
g departments, were subsequently gradually developed. It is nec- 
ssary here to enter into the history of these institutions in more 
etail, but their present position in relation to technical education 
ould be explained. 
GRANTS TO THE CENTRAL INSTITUTIONS. 
In the year 1900 the administration of the science and art grants, 
hich had formerly been in the hands of the South Kensington sci- 
ce and art department, was for Scotland handed over to the Scotch 
ucation department, and advantage was taken of this to at once 
t rid of the system which has done so much to injure education in 
mgland by paying grants on the results of the examinations con- 
cted by the science and art department. This step has enabled 
e Scotch education department to gradually develop the policy 
hich it is now pursuing with reference to these central institutions. 
esides the grants which are paid to the school boards for evening 
mtinuation work—grants based practically on attendance—the 
partment has taken power to itself to treat such institutions as 
chooses to select as central institutions, on quite a different basis 
d under certain conditions. Generally speaking, these conditions 
e that all appointments made to the staffs must be referred to the 
partment for approval; that the calendar and report of the insti- 
tion are submitted annually to the department; that the scheme 
der which the diploma of the institution is granted must receive the

with the staff of the college in the examinations for the diploma, anc 
that these assessors must be approved by the department; and that 
the institution is open at all times to inspection by the department 
either by its own inspecting staff or by a special expert appointed t 
report on some particular department. 
To these central institutions the department makes grants, which 
since the passing of the education act of 1908, are practically on thi 
basis of meeting the deficiency in the maintenance expenditur 
Under the act various sums and funds were consolidated for educ: 
tional purposes. These funds, while all of imperial origin, had bee 
partly in the hands of the Scotch education department and partl 
in the hands of various local authorities. The uses to which the 
consolidated funds and moneys are to be put are laid down und 
the act. One of the uses is laid down by Clause XVI, subsection (¢ 
which reads as follows: 
        
   
    
        
    
   
          
      
   
        
      
     To making payment to central institutions in respect of either capital or maint 
nance expenditure of such sums as the department may determine, being in resp: 
of maintenance sums not less in amount than the sums paid to such institutions respe 
tively for the like purpose in the year ending the thirty-first day of March, one tho 
sand nine hundred and nine, by county councils and town councils from the amou: 
received by such councils under subsection (iii) (b) of section two of the local ta: 
tion (customs and excise) act, 1890. 
In addition, there is a certain residue from these funds which c: 
be used to make grants toward capital expenditure, such gran 
amounting to not more than one-half of the total expenditw 
Under this clause the Scotch education department has issued 
minute which gives it power to make such arrangements wi 
each central institution as it may think fit as to the proportion 
the total expenditure which has to be met from fees and local sour 
of income, so that the practical result is that these central insti 
tions are being financed by the department under the conditio 
which have already been mentioned. These conditions natura 
result in giving these central institutions the greatest possible fri 
dom to develop. 
To deal, in the first place, with the Heriot-Watt College and 
Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College, these institutio 
while engaged in a large amount of evening-class work—in the c 
of the Heriot-Watt College in technical, scientific, trade, and co) 
mercial teaching, and in the case of the Glasgow Technical Coll 
in technical, scientific, and trade subjects—have been gro 
stronger and stronger as day engineering and technical chemis 
schools, the courses of instruction being of university standard 
leading up to a stiff diploma, and in some cases developing into hig 
specialized post-graduate courses attended by students already hi 
ing a science degree. There have also been established in Scotl

three agricultural colleges—at Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen, 
respectively—and these colleges also are recognized by the depart- 
ment as central institutions. There are in addition the following 
other institutions, which are recognized as central institutions, viz: 
The Edinburgh College of Art (opened two years ago), the Glasgow 
School of Art, the Glasgow Atheneum Commercial College, the Leith 
Nautical College, the Edinburgh School of Cookery and Domestic 
Economy, and the Royal Dick Veterinary College. 
RELATION OF CENTRAL INSTITUTIONS TO THE UNIVERSITIES. 
The growth of these central institutions and the development of 
their day work on university lines has gradually caused to emerge a 
very interesting problem, and that is what their relationship is to be 
to existing Scottish universities. In some cases the work done in the 
central institution is quite unrepresented in the university, and in 
ther cases similar departments exist in the universities, the only 
ifference being that while the university gives a degree, the central 
stitution gives a diploma. It is, therefore, one of the most inter- 
sting problems of the future to have the relationship between the 
entral institutions and the universities settled upon broad lines, so 
hat they may fully cooperate and work freely together for the 
evelopment of the higher education in scientific, technical, artistic, 
nd agricultural subjects. So far, certain tentative arrangements 
ave been made here and there, but nothing like a complete scheme 
as yet been developed, except in the case of one or two of the agri- 
ultural colleges. If a scheme is developed on broad lines, it will 
normously strengthen the position of Scotland as being able to offer 
o students coming from various parts of the Empire a complete edu- 
ation of a university standard and in various departments of pure 
d applied science and art. 
Tue ScorrisH UNIVERSITIES. 
In order to understand the developments which have been taking 
lace in connection with the Scottish universities it is necessary to 
ow something of their recent history. This may be said to start 
‘om the universities commission of 1889, which was appointed by 
lhe Government with executive powers to deal with the whole inter- 
al organization of the universities. 
THE UNIVERSITY ORDINANCES. 
This commission drew up a most elaborate scheme of ordinances, 
ealing with the details of the curriculum for every degree and the 
ost minute conditions of university life. This commission also 
rew up regulations under which these ordinances could be altered 
ir a new ordinance made, the regulations requiring that before any
-P-A-G-E-548

     university made a new ordinance or any alteration in an existin; 
ordinance it was required to submit the proposed new or altered 
ordinance to the other three universities, and afterwards to a com: 
mittee of the privy council, this committee of the privy council t 
consider the objections, if any, raised by the other universities, an 
finally to decide whether the proposed new or altered ordinance wa 
to be accepted, modified, or referred back. It is unnecessary t 
point out that machinery of this kind is of the most cumbrous descrip 
tion, and makes it an exceedingly difficult matter to get any chang 
made in an ordinance or to make a new ordinance. The four unive: 
sities naturally watch each other very closely, and very often rais 
objections which are not necessarily to the advantage of higher ed 
cation. In spite of this, however, new ordinances are passed fro 
time to time, and in recent years the tendency has been for the u 
versities to take sufficient powers within the ordinance itself for i 
modification, so as to avoid the necessity of referring every little pr 
posed change in the curriculum to the consideration of the other un‘ 
versities and of the privy council. 
AUTONOMY FOR THE UNIVERSITIES. 
By this side door the universities are recovering some of the auto’ 
omy which they ought never to have lost, and which other unive' 
sities possess as a matter of course. There have been several ne 
ordinances passed lately, both in connection with the medical curri 
ulum and with the arts curriculum. 
The new ordinance for degrees in medicine, however, is evident 
not satisfactory, as there is a strong agitation among those engag: 
in the teaching of medicine for a new ordinance, the fundament 
difficulty being that the course for a medical student is supposed 
last for five years, while it is becoming more and more obvious th 
under modern conditions a period of six years is required to give t. 
student of medicine an adequate training. 
NEW ORDINANCE FOR THE ARTS DEGREE. 
The ordinance dealing with the arts curriculum is, however, t! 
more important, and its bearing will be shown by certain quotatio: 
from it. In order to understand the meaning of the ordinan 
however, it is necessary to say something about the history of t 
arts degree in Scotland. Before the universities commission of 18 
the curriculum for the arts degree consisted of seven subjects— 
Latin, mathematics, English literature, physics, moral philosop 
metaphysics, and Greek. This course of study was based upon t 
old medieval degree, the chair of English being called the chair 
rhetoric and English literature, physics being called natural phil 
ophy, while moral philosophy and metaphysics covered the grou

      f the old subject of philosophy in medizval times. The first modi- 
cation took place under the commission of 1889, by which a con- 
iderable number of additional subjects were introduced and more 
pecialization allowed to the student. This policy of increasing the 
umber of subjects required for the degree and allowing of greater 
pecialization has been carried further in the new ordinance we are 
ow considering. In the first place, the ordinance lays down that 
‘before entering on the curriculum each student shall pass a pre- 
iminary examination in the following subjects: English, Latin or 
reek, mathematics; one of the following: Latin or Greek, if not already 
aken; French, German, Italian, or such other language as the senatus 
ay approve; dynamics.” This is the same preliminary examina- 
lion as was in force before the ordinance was passed, and in lieu of 
his preliminary examination the leaving certificates, which have 
Iready been discussed, have been accepted in the individual sub- 
cts. To quote further from the ordinance, Clause VI reads: 
The curriculum for the ordinary degree shall consist of five subjects, of which two 
bjects shall each be studied for two academical years, and the degree examinations 
these two subjects shall be on a higher standard than the degree examinations in 
e other three subjects; provided that it shall be in the power of the senatus, with 
e approval of the university court, to reckon courses in two cognate subjects (and 
herever so determined by the senatus and university court, studied in separate 
ademical years) as two courses in one subject, the examinations in the cognate 
bjects being on the same standard as if each of the subjects had been taken in a 
gle course. 
* * * * * * * 
Clause VIII reads: 
The departments of study for graduation in arts, with or without honors, shall 
clude the following subjects, with such additions as may hereafter be made by 
le senatus, with the approval of the university court * * * . These are as

4. History and law.

Archeology and art (history of). Public international law.

Clause IX reads as follows: 
      
         
   
   
     
   
       
     
   
   
    
   
     
   
   The senatus, with the approval of the university court, shall have power to mak| 
from time to time regulations regarding the definition and grouping of the subjects ij 
each of the departments of study, the selection of subjects for the curriculum, thei 
classification as cognate, and the order in which they are to be studied, and al: 
regarding the standards of the degree examinations and the conditions of admissio] 
thereto. 
From these clauses it will be at once evident that in the first plac 
beyond the necessity of what has been defined as intensive study i 
two subjects, complete freedom is given as to the nature of the M. 
degree, while the choice of subjects in which the degree can be tak 
is made very wide. In addition, it will be noted that by Clause I 
the senatus is given full power to draw up such regulations or schem 
as it likes, while under Clause VIII it has power to add addition: 
subjects. By this clause complete autonomy has been given to t 
universities, in so far as they have to deal with the M. A. degre 
The ordinance of course contains many other clauses, but tho: 
quoted are of the most significance, and similar ordinances have n: 
been obtained by the universities of Glasgow, St. Andrews, a: 
Aberdeen. 
The manner in which the power of the senatus has been used 
this respect in the different universities somewhat differs, and it 
hardly possible to enter into the details here, but in the case 
Edinburgh University, which is after all the most important, t 
final regulations which have been drawn up by the senatus are | 
follows. In the first place, under these regulations the list of subje 
grouped in the same departments of study are quoted, and t 
double courses in a single subject to be studied for two separ: 
academical years are recognized under Clause VI of the ordinan« 
and, in addition, the double courses in cognate subjects to be stu 
in two separate academical years are recognized under the sa: 
clause; that is to say, that where two subjects are recognized 
cognate, the student can take a year in each instead of two years| 
one subject. 
II. Subjects and departments of study. 
The following are the subjects at present recognized in the fi 
departments of study in which qualifying classes are established:

III. Double courses. 
By a double course is meant the study of a subject for two sep- 
ate academical years, or the study of two cognate subjects in 
cordance with Section VI of the foregoing ordinance. 
Except in the cases in group (c) infra, or in individual cases where 
e senatus with the approval of the university court has, for cause 
ly shown, decided otherwise, the two courses in a double course 
all not be taken in the same academic year; and except in such 
ses a student shall not be allowed to attend the second course of the 
uble course before he has passed the M. A. examination in the first 
urse or has satisfied some test recognized by the faculty of arts 
th the approval of the senatus as equivalent thereto. 
The following double courses are recognized: 
(a) Double courses in a single subject to be studied for two scparate 
ademical years: 
glish. Hebrew. 
tin. Moral philosophy. 
ek. Mathematics. 
tic. Natural philosophy. 
neh. Chemistry.

English, with British history. 
Latin, with French or Celtic. 
Latin, followed by Roman law or classical archeology. 
Greek, with Sanskrit or classical archeology. 
Latin or Greek, followed by ancient history. 
French, with German or Celtic. 
Hebrew, followed by Arabic. 
Psychology, followed by education. 
Political economy, with economic history, geography, or mercantile law. 
Mathematics, followed by natural philosophy, chemistry, or astronomy. 
Natural philosophy, with chemistry. 
Any two of botany, zoology, geology. 
Botany, with chemistry or natural philosophy. 
Geology, followed by geography. 
British history, followed by constitutional, economic, ecclesiastical, or Scotti 
history or history of art. 
Geography, followed by history or economic history. 
Geography, with military history. 
Ancient history, followed by ecclesiastical history. 
(ce) Double courses in cognate subjects to be studied in the sa: 
academical year or in two separate academical years: 
Latin, with Greek. 
Logic and philosophical introduction, with psychology. 
Logic and philosophical introduction, with moral philosophy. 
Psychology, with moral philosophy. 
Moral philosophy, with political economy. 
Ancient history, with British history. 
Ancient history, with classical archeology. 
The only restrictions put on the curriculum are as follows: 
Every curriculum admitted for an ordinary degree must embrace subjects tal 
from at least three out of the four departments of study, enumerated in No. II of t! 
additional regulations, geography to be reckoned for the present purpose as a sub: 
in the department of history and law. 
Every student at the beginning of his first term must submit the subjects which| 
proposes for his curriculum, and at least a provisional order of study for the appr: 
of the official advisers, who act under the control of the faculty. 
Any subsequent alteration of the curriculum must be submitted to the offi 
advisers and the dean. 
It is evident from this that a practically unlimited amount 
freedom is given to the student in selecting his course of study; 
fact he can virtually construct his course for his degree in arts u 
almost any lines he chooses. The old idea, therefore, of the degre 
arts representing a definite course of education and a definite stand: 
of culture has entirely disappeared. One of the reasons for 
policy has been the increasing demand for the M. A. degree on 
part of those proposing to enter the teaching profession. T!
-P-A-G-E-553
EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN SCOTLAND. 545 
students wish to qualify themselves more and more in certain subjects 
which they think will be of value to them afterwards, and so the M. A. 
degree has ceased to be regarded as a general culture degree and has 
become a specialized degree to meet the requirements of the teaching 
profession. 
This scheme of the senatus was strenuously opposed by certain 
members of the general council, but they were defeated, and the 
scheme as it stands was approved of. Whether it is to be regarded 
as a real reform is a very different question, and it is looked upon 
by many with great doubt and hesitation. The passing of an ordi- 
ance which gives power to the senatus and the university court to 
eal with its own curriculum is certainly a step in the right direction, 
ut it is perhaps unfortunate that the first opportunity which a 
cotch university has had of exercising such autonomy has resulted 
nsuch a complete abandonment of any conception of what a uni- 
ersity education means or what should be included in the M. A. 
legree, and it remains to be seen in the future what the outcome of 
his policy will be. 
Another reform which has recently been carried out in the Scotch 
niversities is the adoption of the three-term system in place of the 
ld system of a long winter session and a summer session devoted to 
special classes. 
      
           
        
    
          
     
    
        
    
   
    
    
      IMPERIAL GRANTS TO THE UNIVERSITIES. 
The only other matter of special interest to be referred to in con- 
ection with the universities is the necessity that has been pressed 
pon them of obtaining larger grants from imperial sources to meet 
heir growing expenditure. The assistance which has. been given to 
e universities by the Carnegie trust, which will be referred to 
ter, has generally taken the form of capital endowmenf, and this, 
hile improving their usefulness, has necessarily increased their 
aintenance expenditure, and the funds are not available at present 
r meeting this increased expenditure. This demand for additional 
nds from the imperial treasury has necessarily raised the delicate 
uestion of the extent to which the giving of such moneys is to result 
governmental control. With our usual want of system in this 
untry, the result of the appeal of the universities for more money 
‘om the national purse has been of two kinds. On the one hand, a 
ecial committee was appointed by the treasury to inquire into the 
eds of the universities, and this committee has reported in favor 
giving additional grants, amounting to some £40,000 a year, on 
mdition that the schemes for the expenditure of this money should 
submitted to the treasury. But in addition to this a clause 
lause XVI, (b)] was introduced into, the 1908 education (Scotland) 
| 59041°—xp 1910—vor 1—35  
-P-A-G-E-554
546 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
act in that portion of the act dealing with the future expenditure of 
the consolidated funds which have already been referred to, and by, 
this clause the Scotch education department are enabled to make| 
grants to the universities. The clause is as follows:    
       
     
    
     
   
          
        
   
     
   
    
        
   
   
      Tomaking payment to the universitiesof Scotland, in addition toany sums other- 
wise payable to them under any act, of such sums in respect of yearly maintenance 
expenditure as the secretary for Scotland, on application by the university courts, o1 
any of them, may determine after consideration of the results of such inquiries as h 
may from time to time direct to be made by a special committee appointed by him 
Provided, That each university court shall make an annual report to the secretary fo: 
Scotland as to the mode in which it has applied any sum so granted. 
If this clause is contrasted with that dealing with the central! 
institutions [Clause XVI, (c)], it at once reveals a fear on the part o: 
universities that they might come under the control of the Scote 
education department, a fear which has resulted in a proposal tha 
any money granted to the universities out of these funds should b 
paid through a special committee. This would not be the committe 
which has been dealing with the application for an increased treasur. 
grant. The universities themselves are, on the one hand, going t 
draw £40,000 a year from the treasury, submitting their scheme t 
the treasury direct, a grant over which the Scotch education depar 
ment will have no control and regarding which it will not be able t 
exercise any voice, and on the other hand they may be able to g 
additional grants through the Scotch education department und 
this other committee appointed by the secretary for Scotland. The: 
is probably no other country in the world except our own whe: 
such a scheme could have been passed. 
THE UNIVERSITIES AND STATE CONTROL. 
It is evident that this matter of additional grants to the universiti 
is of fundamental importance, because the whole question is raisi 
as to what the relations of the State to the universities should be. 
is obvious that, as the universities depend ultimately upon the Sta 
for part of their endowments, the State in the final resort must ha 
the right to interfere, but it is of the utmost importance, if high 
education is to develop and progress, that the universities should 
free from state interference. Nevertheless such interference w 
come, as it has come in the past, through royal commissions if t 
universities do not get into touch with all the modern moveme 
around them. It is a remarkable fact, as has already been show] 
that the universities have no voice in the leaving certificate exa 
nations in connection with the secondary schools, but have allow 
the control to get entirely into the hands of the Scotch educati 
department. On the other hand, they are moving very slowly towa: 
a hearty cooperation with the new and vigorous central institutio 
which are developing at their doors. Serious problems are a

   ‘ising in the technical schools, owing to the necessity for reorganizing 
e relationship of the university to the extramural schools. While 
ey are thus delaying to put themselves into living touch with the 
ucational movements of the time, they are jealously fearing inter- 
rence on the part of the State. It is hardly necessary to point out 
at this double policy must ultimately result in the State again 
tervening, probably in the form of another royal commission. 
THE CARNEGIE TRUST. 
It is impossible to leave the subject of the universities without 
ying a few words about the Carnegie trust. This body continues 
benefit higher education in Scotland through its three channels of 
meficence, namely, the payment of students’ fees, the giving of 
pital grants for founding new chairs and building laboratories, and 
e encouragement of scientific research by providing grants for the 
rchase of apparatus, the institution of research fellowships and 
earch scholarships. When the scheme was originally drawn up, 
must have been very difficult for the trustees to decide in what way 
ley were going to administer the funds devoted to the payment of 
s. Their final decision was to use this money in raising the stand- 
of education in the universities, both for those entering it and 
se continuing their studies, and it will be found that the regula- 
ns are drawn up to this effect and have undoubtedly improved the 
ndard of work throughout. It is unnecessary to say anything of 
benefits gained to learning and science by the administration of 
other part of the funds in the hands of the trustees. At the same 
e there is one direction in which, if possible, they might still do a 
at deal to advance the pursuit of pure science, and that is by 
anging to grant research assistants to professors whose staffs are 
irely occupied with teaching. In certain cases the Carnegie trust 
done this, and has, I believe, found difficulties in carrying out 
h a scheme in practice, but its value to science would be 
ense and is worthy of their further consideration. 
Tur TRAINING OF THE TEACHER. 
p to the year 1901 the method of training teachers in Scotland 
the elementary schools was by means of the pupil-teacher system, 
young student carrying on his or her education and doing a cer- 
amount of teaching at the same time, and finally passing on to 
of the training colleges which were in the hands of the various 
rches. In Edinburgh we had three training colleges for teachers, 
ducted by the Established Church of Scotland, the Free Church 
cotland, and the Scottish Episcopal Church. In 1901 the Scotch 
cation department began to modify the whole of the scheme, and

   the new scheme is now getting into thorough working order on qui 
a different basis. In the first place, the Scotch education departme: 
has, itself, taken over the training colleges from the Established a: 
Free churches, and have created in the four university towns 
Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, and St. Andrews, four bodies kno 
as provincial committees which are responsible for the training 
teachers. These committees were selected to represent varied educ! 
tional interests. At the same time, the old pupil-teacher system h 
been abolished and has been replaced by regulations governing t 
passage of students who wish to become teachers, from the elementa: 
schools into the higher grade schools, and from the higher gra’ 
schools to the training colleges, while assistance is provided by 
system of scholarships. The education of the primary teacher 
given in two stages, the pupil teacher or junior student stage, ai 
the senior student stage. Candidates for the junior studentship m 
hold the intermediate certificate of the Scotch education departme 
They must therefore be 15 years of age, and for a period extendi 
normally over three years they undergo instruction in English a: 
another language, history, geography, mathematics, element: 
science, drawing, physical exercises, music, and also in some cas 
in woodwork or needlework or school gardening. Junior stude 
have also to undergo systematic training in the art of teaching e 
of the primary school subjects. Those who perform all their w 
satisfactorily and who pass an examination at the end of their cou 
are awarded a junior student certificate, giving full details regard: 
their attainments. 
The candidate next passes to the senior stage, and there underg 
a further course of education and professional training, which exte 
generally over not less than two years. The senior student may 
further instruction in the subjects of general education enumera’ 
above for junior students, and the training authorities may all] 
students to attend a university, or a school of art, technical colle 
agricultural college, or college of domestic science for the furt 
study of subjects for which they are qualified as shown by entrie: 
their junior student certificates. At each training center, a partic 
study is made of such professional subjects as hygiene (includin 
course in physical exercises), psychology, logic, ethics, and the hist 
and principles of education. The students in training must unde} 
a course of instruction in the methods of teaching all the subject: 
the primary school curriculum, and must obtain adequato prac 
in the schools in the district in teaching these subjects under s 
supervision. If the student aims at being a teacher in a second 
or intermediate school, the standard of knowledge required 
speaking generally, that of a university degree with honors in 
subject, or proof of attainments in it equivalent to this. The co

of training for secondary school teachers is not definitely prescribed, 
but generally includes a number of the same subjects as are studied 
by those who are going to be primary teachers. The training of 
teachers of special subjects, such as cookery and laundry work, 
drawing, manual training, etc., is not quite so satisfactorily developed 
in Scotland yet, as in the case of primary and secondary teachers. 
This new system has now got thoroughly under way, and the pupils are 
beginning to enter the training colleges under the new system. The 
total number of students in the various stages of preparation for 
teaching in Scotland being for 1908-9, 3,208 junior students and 
2,953 senior students. Of the junior students 2,500 were females 
and 700 were males. Of the 824 students in training in Edinburgh 
last session 380 were attending university graduating courses, show- 
ing how largely university education is now being taken advantage of.

It will be found from the foregoing account that the whole field of 
Scotch education is at present alive with fresh movements and 
developments, and that consequently in the course of a short article, 
such as this, it is impossible to deal adequately with all these phe- 
nomena, while the final result on the reader’s mind might be one of 
confusion. Behind the movements, however, that are taking place 
in connection with elementary and secondary education, continuation 
work, the central institutions, and the training of teachers, there can 
be seen certain guiding principles at work on the part of the Scotch 
education department. It may be difficult to state these completely, 
but at any rate, one or two of them are sufficiently obvious. In the 
first place, it is evidently the desire of the Scotch education depart- 
ment to get rid as far as possible of all external examination tests. 
This country has suffered almost as much as China has from this 
system of detecting merit, and as the whole methods of the depart- 
ment are more and more evolved, they show an evident desire to 
build up the various institutions, whether they be elementary schools, 
econdary schools, or technical colleges, on broad lines, and then to 
eave to those responsible for the educational work in these institu- 
ions the decision as to the capabilities of the scholars, and their fit- 
ess for other work. This may seem to be in the United States an 
vious plan, but it has been a slow and difficult battle to persuade 
hose in this country who have got wedded to the examination system 
hat it is one which tends to kill all true education. In this respect, 
ngland is years behind Scotland, and its educational system is still 
ound in the trammels of the external examination idea. It is also 
uite evident by studying the various developments taking place 
hat the Scotch education department is trying to make all education

                                  an organized whole, in which every part has its place, and in which, 
yet there is one organized scheme permeated by a central idea. 
As has already been pointed out, while the elementary schools, the 
secondary schools, and the central institutions are all working har- 
moniously toward these ideals, the difficulty which is looming in the 
future is the question of their relationship to the universities. This 
has already been raised in connection with the university preliminary 
examination. In the past the university has accepted in lieu of that 
examination the leaving certificate in definite individual subjects, 
but the leaving certificate of the future is to be a group certificate 
and a great variety of groups are to be instituted. Is the university, 
then, to accept these groups, as evidence of a sufficient secondary 
education for admission to its degrees, and nothing be done to bring 
the university itself into touch with these leaving certificate exam- 
inations, giving it some voice as to the lines on which secondary 
education is to move? This is one problem; the other is the rela- 
tionship of the universities to the new and vigorous central institu- 
tions growing up around them and the reorganization of the extra 
mural system. If universities can realize the importance of these 
central institutions and come forward with a broad and generous 
policy, Scotland should continue to hold its place as a center of higher 
education for students from all parts of the Empire.

ELEMENTARY. 
In Ireland, according to Mr. Graham Balfour, the problem of public 
ducation at the beginning of the nineteenth century ‘‘seemed almost 
opeless.”” The principal adverse factors were differences of race 
md of religion between the governed and the governing classes, 
bsence of trade and industry to provide an outlet for the surplus 
opulation, and widespread poverty. It was only in 1781 and 1792 
at the penal statutes of William and Ann had been repealed which 
brebade Catholics either to teach in Ireland or send their children 
road to be taught. In fact up to the end of the eighteenth century 
e majority of schools were founded, apart from the ideal of the 
551

  552 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
advancement of learning, for the sake of propagating the religion 
and language of the dominant race. In 1824 what elementary edu- 
cation there was in the country may be summarized as follows: First, 
there were the lay societies (mostly Protestant) who had taken under 
their control many of the parish schools founded under an act of 
Henry VIII. The chief of these, the Kildare Society, had on it 
books at that date 59,208 pupils out of a total of 106,012 for all th 
societies, Then there were the Catholic schools with 46,119, the pri 
vate and other schools with 13,686 pupils, and, lastly, there were n 
less than 394,732 scholars in the so-called ‘‘pay”’ schools, which wer 
mainly the old Catholic ‘‘Hedge schools” where under the old penal 
laws—     
       
   
    
        
         
     
    
      
    
   
       
    
    Still crouching ’neath the sheltering hedge or stretched on mountain fern, 
The teacher and his pupils met feloniously to learn. 
The Kildare Place Society mentioned above owed its initial suc 
cess to the fact that it was composed of persons of various denomi 
nations, with the professed object of supporting schools of an unde 
nominational character, but the reading of the Scriptures withou| 
note or comment was insisted on in all its schools, and this ultimatel 
rendered it unacceptable to the Catholics, while the state grant 
which were its main support, were withdrawn in 1832. In 182 
the Catholic emancipation act, relieving Catholics of nearly al 
their disabilities, became law, and in the previous year a sele 
committee of the House of Commons had reported in favor of 
general scheme of combined literary and separate religious educ: 
tion, which, in the words of the chief secretary for Ireland, ‘shoul 
be capable of being adapted to the views of the religious persuasio 
which prevail in Ireland as to render it in truth a system of nation: 
education.”’ It is only fair to add that the real, though unacknow| 
edged, author of this scheme was the famous educationist, M 
(afterwards Sir) Thomas Wyse. 
In 1831 steps were taken to give effect to this policy, which w: 
strongly supported by D. O’Connell, ‘the liberator,” and the Rom 
Catholic hierarchy. The central control was placed in the han 
of a board of commissioners of national education, composed 
Protestants and Roman Catholics of high personal character. T 
commissioners originally numbered 7; subsequently their numb 
was increased, and in 1860 it was limited to 20, 10 of whom were 
be Protestants and 10 Roman Catholics. A paid commissioner w, 
added to the board shortly after its foundation under the title 
resident commissioner. The principal functions of the board w 
to have complete control of the schools, to make grants, provid 
local contributions were forthcoming, to require the schools to 
kept open for a certain number of hours for combined moral a: 
literary education, while making provision on one or two days 
 
-P-A-G-E-561
  EDUCATION IN IRELAND, 553 
separate religious instruction, to exercise control over all school books 
in use, to allow the local patron (generally a clergyman) or man- 
agers to appoint the teachers, subject to the board regulations, which 
did not, however, allow of a right of appeal to the board in case of 
dismissal, and, finally, to inspect the schools. 
The religious difficulty was not long in showing itself. The Prot- 
lestants and the Presbyterians objected to the exclusion of the Bible 
in school hours. On the other hand, the rules were not rigorously 
applied in all districts, and the Catholics, fearing proselytism, held 
aloof. In 1834 there were only 789 schools, with 107,042 children, 
mder the board. But in 1866, after some thirty years of trial and 
xperiment, the religious difficulty was settled by reverting to the 
riginal rule that no child should be allowed to remain for the 
eligious instruction of a denomination other than its own unless the 
arent has requested it in writing, while the religious instruction has 
be’so fixed that no child shall be excluded indirectly or directly 
‘om the general advantages of the school. 
The principal religious societies which remained outside the control 
f the board were the Church Education Society and the Christian 
rothers. The Church Education Society was a Church of Ireland 
ody. It flourished for many years, and in 1867 it had no less than 
451 schools and 63,549 scholars; but after the disestablishment 
f the Church of Ireland its numbers greatly declined, and in 1891 
tt had only 260 schools and 6,494 pupils. 
The Christian Brothers was a ‘‘congregation” founded in 1802 in 
aterford by Mr. Edmond Rice for the education of poor Catholic 
oys. It was based to a certain extent on the model of the Christian 
rothers of de la Salle in France. The members take the vows of 
overty, chastity, and obedience, and also a vow to teach children 
ratuitously. It grew rapidly. In 1863 it had in Ireland 171 schools 
f different kinds which were educating some 19,380 children. In 
891 the figures were 130 schools and 21,382 pupils. In many of 
hese schools they are doing work of a higher literary or ‘“‘voca- 
ional’”’ kind, as will be described later. The Christian Brothers 
ave also extended their activities to England and the colonies. As 
nn agency of true democratic education they have performed to a 
markable extent the function of giving many of the brighter boys 
if the nation the chance of rising in life. In 1903 they were edu- 
ting some 27,000 elementary children and 3,000 intermediate. 
A select committee under Mr. Wyse as chairman, which reported 
the House of Commons in 1838, may be mentioned here as antici- 
lating many reforms, some of which have since been adopted. A 
eat feature was made of object lessons. Manual and physical 
aining were recommended, as well as agricultural teaching. Sing- 
g and drawing were strongly advocated. The creation of local 
ucation authorities with power to strike a rate was also proposed.

    The board has founded in all some 32 model schools to promote 
“united education,” to act as schools of experiment and example, 
and to train teachers. These schools have failed, unfortunately, to 
secure the full confidence of the Roman Catholics. In spite of this 
and other drawbacks the number of schools under the board steadil. 
increased. In 1865-69 they numbered 6,586, with an averag 
attendance of 354,853 pupils. A royal commission under Lor 
Powis was appointed in 1868. Its report in nine volumes was pu 
lished in 1870, and many of its chief recommendations have since 
been adopted. The comparatively low state of education is show 
by the statement, “‘ We know very well that 45 per cent of the attend 
ance in the national schools are in the first book.” 
The state of things in 1871 is thus described by Doctor Starkie 
“A very large proportion of the schools were wretched thatche 
cabins, badly lighted, badly and inadequately furnished, and kep 
in bad repair. * * * The attendance was a negligible quantit; 
Pupils strolled into school all day and left without any excuse. Thi 
rolls were not called until a fair muster was made at 12 o’clock o: 
later. In 1871 there were 1,000,000 children on the rolls, and th 
average attendance was 350,000—exactly 35 per cent. In som 
counties the attendance was below 20 per cent—for instance, i 
Mayo, 11.9. * * * In 1871 only 7.9 were in the senior classe 
* * * Tn Mayo only 15 were in the highest class out of a pop 
lation of 250,000.’ These figures are highly significant in the lig! 
of subsequent progress. 
Teachers’ salaries in 1841 ranged from £20 to £12 for males, £1 
to £10 for females, special methods being adopted for the payme 
of teachers belonging to religious bodies. Payment by results wi 
introduced in a modified form in 1871. According to compete 
witnesses, it produced a beneficial effect at the time in the way 
leveling up the teaching, but it reproduced here, as elsewhere, t! 
same injurious effect of making the teaching mechanical, and j 
1900 the system was abolished. In 1875 two important acts affec 
ing teachers were passed. One was an attempt to induce loc 
authorities to raise money for education by offering addition: 
treasury grants. Of the boards of guardians interested, not mo 
than 73 out of 163 ever took up the matter. This number sank 
1897 to 25, and in 1900, on the abolition of payment by result, t 
source of contribution ceased. The total amount from local soure 
of all kinds only amounts to about 6 per cent. The other importa: 
act of 1875 afforded to a certain extent financial facilities for provi 
ing residences for teachers—a long-felt want. This act was follow 
by a similar one in 1879, which also contained provisions for teac| 
ers’ pensions, a sum of £1,300,000 of the funds of the disestablish 
church being set aside for that purpose.
-P-A-G-E-563
  
EDUCATION IN IRELAND. 555 
The deficit in trained teachers in Ireland was brought out by the 
tatistics of 1883, which showed that only 52 per cent, or 1,412 out 
f 2,714 Protestant teachers, and 27 per cent, or 2,142 out of 7,907 
oman Catholic teachers, were trained. The schools also were 
uch understaffed. England at that time had three times and 
cotland nearly six times as many teachers in proportion as Ireland. 
‘he revelation of this disparity led to the creation or recognition of 
certain number of voluntary training colleges in addition to the 
oard’s own college in Marlborough street, Dublin. Government 
lelp was given to such colleges up to 75 per cent of their annual 
penditure. As a result of these reforms the number of teachers 
ho had received one or two years’ training rose to 53 per cent in 
O01. 
Compulsory education for Ireland was proposed by the House of 
mmons in 1883. It was not till 1892, however, that education, 
hich had previously been made free in Scotland and England, was 
mdered gratuitous in Ireland, and an attempt was made to set up 
mpulsory attendance in the town and townships. The discretion 
extending it to the counties was given to the county councils, 
ich were created in 1898. Owing to financial difficulties the 
inciple was adopted slowly, even in the towns. In 1901 only 83 
t of 120 townships had adopted the requisite machinery, and 43 
ral districts. Taking these districts together, the total attendance 
ter a few years showed an excess of 5 per cent over the rest of 
eland, the improvement being most marked in rural districts. 
At the outset the board was very anxious to encourage industrial 
d agricultural training. The efforts at industrial education did 
t produce any permanent results. In agriculture they were more 
tunate. In 1837 two agricultural schools were established, and 
1838 a model farm and garden were opened at Glasnevin. Subse- 
ently the commissioners began to lease and manage farms. 
ese in 1875 numbered no less than 228. Agriculture was made 
obligatory subject. Unfortunately it was largely theoretical, and 
value may be gauged by the statement that the highest marks 
re earned, according to Doctor Starkie, by the town ‘‘gamins”’ 
Belfast. By 1900 all the farms belonging to the commissioners 
d been given up with the exception of Glasnevin and another, 
ich were taken over by the agricultural and technical department, 
ose duties were twofold, one to encourage agriculture and indus- 
and the other to encourage scientific and technical instruction in 
schools. The work of the department, which is mostly con- 
ned with higher and technical education, will be described later. 
n 1898 a vice-regal commission, called the Belmore commission, 
orted in favor of a more practical education being introduced 
the schools, thereby confirming many of the recommendations

of the Wyse committee fifty years before, involving an extension « 
the kindergarten for infants and of woodwork and hand and ey 
training for the older children. Drawing (taken by only 31 per cer 
of the children) and singing were to be made compulsory; the bool 
ish agriculture was to be replaced by elementary science. T 
general verdict of the commission was that while it fitted boys 
enter the secondary schools (intermediate), it left them “not fit 
enter a technical school, even if they had such a school at th 
doors.” Two years later a body of organizers for instructing a 
advising teachers was created, and the teaching is every year beco 
ing more and more practical in the schools. Classes also for trai 
ing national teachers in science and art are carried on by the ag 
cultural and technical education department in the technical schoo! 
such classes being under the joint inspection of the national boa 
and of the department. 
The beginning of the twentieth century showed a revived pub! 
interest in Irish education, elementary as well as university. T 
whole system was fiercely attacked by Mr. Macarthy in his ‘‘Prie 
and People,” and by Mr. Hugh O’Donnell in his ‘‘ Ruin of Irish Edu 
tion.” A certain number of outspoken criticisms were also made 
Doctor Starkie, the resident commissioner, speaking in his priv: 
capacity at the meeting of the British Association in Belfast 
September, 1902. Doctor Starkie pointed out that while the revis| 
scheme for teachers’ salaries might be expected to do much 
improving education, the absence of a strong public opinion 
favor of education was a marked feature in Ireland. He a 
brought out the comparative lack of effective compulsion, attenda 
in Ireland being only 63 per cent as against 82.4 in England and 8 
in Scotland. Even the worst Welsh County, Anglesey, had a bet: 
average (73.3) than the best Irish county. He chisted on 
defective state of the schoolhouses (1,100 described ‘‘as scare 
habitable”). He criticised the comparative indifference of 
managers, whether Church of Ireland, Presbyterian, or Catho. 
and alluded to, but did not advocate, the levying of local rates 
education as a means of enlisting and interesting local public opini 
The parties concerned were not long in composing their rep. 
and a vigorous pamphlet was published by Rev. M. O’Riord

influences in Sir Horace Plunkett’s ‘‘Ireland in the New Centw 
Other brochures of a similar kind were issued by the Rev. J. Malo 
P. P. (‘Trish Education’’), and the Rev. M. Curry. 
In the midst of this turmoil of controversy one point seems pre 
clear—that if the clerical managers had not always shown all 
zeal they might, they were after all the main persons in the coun 
to show any zeal at all, as far as elementary education was concer: 
     
     
        
      
   
   
   
     
      
      
   
      
      
  
-P-A-G-E-565
EDUCATION IN IRELAND. 557 
In 1904 Mr. F. H. Dale, an inspector in the English board of educa- 
tion, was deputed by the lord lieutenant, ‘‘to inquire and report how 
typical Irish elementary day schools compare with similarly circum- 
stanced public elementary schools in England as regards premises, 
equipment, staffing, and instruction; and to what causes differences 
in economy and efficiency appear to be due.’ He reported that 
the Irish school buildings in towns were ‘‘markedly inferior” to 
English of a similar type, and proposed as a remedy the creation 
of local bodies with rating powers for education. On the other 
hand, he stated that the majority of country school buildings did 
not compare unfavorably with the corresponding English ones. 
The equipment was ‘‘tolerably satisfactory,” but except in the 
convent schools the Irish schools were very deficient in attractive- 
ness of appearance and equipment other than in necessaries. Mr. 
Dale noted that ‘‘a much larger proportion” of Irish teachers were 
trained than English, ‘‘a circumstance that creates a strong 
presumption of greater efficiency.” The difference in salaries for 
head teachers on the whole was, ceteris paribus, not remarkable, 
while many head mistresses were even better paid than their English 
colleagues. The salaries of assistants was ‘‘distinctly lower,” but 
their chances of promotion to headships were greater. Mr. Dale 
further pointed out the unnecessary multiplication of small separate 
chools, which had steadily increased, though the population was 
inishing. ‘‘The primary cause has been the preference for a 
trictly denominational system of education. The object of the 
ational school system in Ireland has therefore not been achieved.” 
ess strict control on the part of the central authority than exists 
England over the supply and organization of schools was also 
iven as a contributory reason. Mr. Dale likewise indicated that 
ittle or no local interest was shown except by the clergy. The con- 
ent schools were singled out as at once the least expensive and 
mong the most efficient and best-managed schools. Other points 
f criticism were the inadequacy and faulty distribution of the staff, 
specially in the small schools of 40 to 59 pupils: the irregularity of 
ttendance, which in several schools might be improved by the 
onveyance of the children in covered carts; the inferiority of the 
iscipline and of the methods and aims of instruction. The subjects 
ecently introduced into the code were pronounced a success with 
Ihe exception of the hand and eye training. 
The board at once took cognizance of Mr. Dale’s report, and in 
heir annual report for 1903 published some very remarkable statis- 
ics of progress during the last century. In 1851 (twenty years 
fter the foundation of the board) the illiterates over 5 years old 
umbered 47 per cent of the population. In 1901 they had sunk 
14 per cent. In 1871 of the children between 10 to 15 only 59

per cent could read and write; in 1901 the percentage had risen tc 
94 per cent. They further pointed out that the percentage of trained 
teachers, 57 per cent, was much higher than that for England and 
Wales. 
Certain of Mr. Dale’s recommendations were adopted by the 
board within a year or two of his report, notably in respect to dimin- 
ishing the excessive number of small schools, to increasing the 
salaries of assistants, and making an addition to the staff in the shape 
of a manual instructress in small schools with an average of 35 to 49 
The rebuilding and remodeling of unsuitable buildings had long 
been occupying the serious attention of the board. But for several 
years after 1901 the preparation of new plans hung fire and delay 
was no doubt also caused by the uncertainty of the political situation. 
There was, in consequence, an accumulation of arrears in the way 0: 
urgent cases. In1907 an Irish council bill was brought in by the 
Government. As far as education was concerned, the national boar¢ 
and the intermediate board, which looks after secondary education 
were to be replaced by an educational department or committec 
under the control of the council and organized by it, additiona’ 
members (not excluding women) to be added by the lord lieutenant: 
The bill was, however, withdrawn, and subsequently no attempt has 
been made to coordinate Irish education. One great difficulty of the 
board was the absence of any local rate or aid toward the cost o: 
education. It has, however, been pointed out that apart from the 
very large number of children educated free by the Christian Brother: 
the whole upkeep of the schools, occasionally part of the teacher’ 
salary, and half the rent of the teacher’s residence, are provide 
locally. The latter half is usually, however, paid by the teache 
but in about 5 per cent of the schools the teacher’s residence ij 
provided entirely locally. In 1907 a fixed sum was given by th 
English treasury of £40,000 for three years in order to assist th 
commissioners in making building grants. Certain sums from th 
development grants were also provided which did not, howeve 
materialize, and judging from the most recent report much sti 
remains to be done. In 1908 a parliamentary grant of £114,00 
was made to improve teachers’ salaries. The principle has also bee 
adopted of providing covered carts for the conveyance of childre 
living at a distance. 
Special training in horticulture has been arranged for in conjun 
tion with the department of agriculture and technical instructio: 
but the necessary funds for carrying it out are still lacking. T 
study of Irish has been fostered with striking results. There we 
105 schools taking the subject in 1899; in 1901 the number w: 
1,198. At the end of December, 1906, the schools numbered 2,07: 
with 161,740 pupils. In 1908 the number of schools had risen

047. During the same period the bilingual schools rose from 36 to 
68. The number of children taking Irish was 195,801. According 
a recent report by Mr. D. Mangan to the board, the standard of 
tainment is rather uneven, but much good work is being done. 
The schools themselves are becoming more and more denomina- 
onal in practice. In 1883 the percentage of schools containing 
th Roman Catholics and Protestants numbered 53.8 of the whole 
mber. The percentage has progressively declined, and at the 
d of each quinquennium the percentages were successively 48.4, 
.5, 38.1, 33.1, 30.4, the latter being the figure for 1908. This 
eans, in other words, that more than two-thirds of the children are 
schools where the pupils are either exclusively Protestant or 
clusively Catholic. This of course is the real cause of the number 
small schools. In 1908 out of 8,336 there were 5 with less than 10 
the rolls; 196 with less than 15; 253 with less than 20; 677 with 
s than 25; and 699 with less than 30; thus, 1,830, or 22 per cent of 
e whole, have under 30 pupils. 
The percentage of average attendance for 1908 is noteworthy as 
ing the highest on record, amounting to 71.1. The total percentage 
trained teachers is 64.7. 
It would seem that the controversies that arose at the opening of 
le twentieth century have largely quieted down, not, however, 
thout leading to a substantial increase in efficiency in the ways 
ntioned above, though much still remains to be done in the way 
improving the school buildings and raising the standard of attend- 
ce toa higher level. The chief outstanding problems would appear 
be better pensions for teachers, further amalgamation of small 
ools, the establishment of higher grade schools for continuative 
ucation, provision of school gardens and improvements in cleaning 
d heating in the schools, in the cost of which the local managers 
lw appear to be willing to share.

vide for Irish education by the foundation of the so-called dio 
esan free schools, which quickly became schools of a classical a 
grammar-school type, and of the royal free schools which were main 
established within the Ulster ‘‘plantation.”” Although intended to 
free to all denominations, these schools were practically attended 
Protestants alone, owing to their Protestant ‘‘atmosphere.” A f 
more grammar schools were founded during the seventeenth centu 
by private persons, notably the Earl of Cork and Erasmus Smith, 
alderman of London. The penal statutes of William IIT (1631) a 
of Anne (1692) entirely deprived the mass of Catholic population 
all education. Henceforth parents were condemned to send th 
children abroad secretly to school or have them educated equa! 
surreptitiously at home. 
A commission that reported in 1791 found there were 46 gram: 
schools with 1,214 pupils and an income from endowment of £7,6 
Commissioners of charitable donations and bequests were appoin 
in 1800 to look after charitable endowments. In 1858 they mana; 
an income of £2,461, mainly applicable to education. More impo| 
ant were the board of commissioners of education in Ireland, who wi 
appointed in 1813 to look after all the endowed schools with cert 
definite exceptions. They do not seem to have had a very success} 
record in the management either of the estates or of the schools. 
select committee, who sat from 1835 to 1838, with Mr. Wyse as ch: 
man, drew up a scheme for secondary education as comprehensiv: 
that they proposed for elementary education (see Elementa: 
There was to be in every county an academy or provincial coll 
and in each of the four provinces an agricultural college. The ty 
of education were not only to be classical, but commercial and sci 
tific. Local education rates were recommended, and the creatio: 
a chair of education at the university advocated. 
The Ursuline nuns were permitted to establish themselves 
Ireland in 1771. In 1821 the Loretto nuns, a teaching commun 
founded their first Irish branch. The foundation of the Chris’ 
Brothers was at an earlier date (see Elementary), but for many y 
their work was almost entirely elementary. Later on they wen 
largely for higher education and in 1903 they were educating a t 
of the boys in secondary education. 
The Kildare commission, reporting in 1858 on the endowed scho 
found there were 52 endowed grammar schools and 2 super| 
English schools with an income of £15,452. At the same time ti 
pointed out there were no less than 91 towns with a population of

under the commissioners for elementary education. The total 
endowments amounted to £85,000, but of this only £8,000 was in 
funster and £891 in Connaught. In 1885 the education endowment 
lact was passed which allowed the endowed schools to be reorganized 
nd their endowments as far as possible to be extended to the benefit 
f both sexes, while the board of commissioners of education was 
eformed and reconstructed. 
In the same year as the Rosse commission was appointed a new 
ody was called into existence to provide for the state organization 
f secondary education. The need especially from the Catholic point 
f view was particularly urgent. While out of every 100,000 people 
in Scotland 371 were receiving a secondary education, in Ireland out of 
imilar numbers of Protestants and Catholics, respectively, there were 
99 Protestants and only 2 Catholics. To remedy this glaring defi- 
iency, the intermediate education act was passed. The administra- 
ion of the act was entrusted to a board composed of representatives of 
ifferent denominations. Its functions were to carry on a system of 
ublic examinations, to grant prizes, exhibitions, and certificates, and 
jo pay managers of schools fees dependent on the results of its public 
xXaminations. 
As regards income, the board were allotted £1,000,000 out of the 
nds of the disestablished church, the income of which amounted to 
32,000, though it subsequently sank to £27,000. The local taxation 
ct of 1890, which assigned £78,000 to the national board, handed over 
e available residue, some £50,000 a year, to the intermediate board. 
he intermediate board was successful from the outset as regards the 
umber who took the examinations, but criticisms were not long in 
aking themselves felt, as was only likely in a system based on pay- 
ent by results. The board themselves finally recognized ‘‘there 
ere grave defects in the system,”’ and on their own petition they were 
mstituted in 1898 into a vice-regal commission to inquire into and 
port on the system and its working. Judging by the evidence, 
ong the main evils alleged against the system were the excessive 
mpetition and cramming it engendered. It was further declared 
make the teaching mechanical, to discourage preparation for all 
her types of continuative education other than university, and to 
mpt the teacher to concentrate on the clever pupils to the neglect 
the rest. It was said to lead to overwork and physical overstrain. 
was accused of producing a neglect of voluntary subjects and a 
rect discouragement of oral teaching in modern languages and of the 
actical teaching of science. It was stated that not half the inter- 
ediate pupils were presented for the examinations and not a third 
ssed them. Many witnesses declared that it encouraged ‘‘tout- 
g” for distinguished pupils and actually led to bargaining between 
rents and teachers.

On the other hand its administration was ‘‘universally”’ admitted t 
be impartial. The examinations had proved their value as ai 
independent and authoritative test of the work of the schools. I 
had enabled poor pupils of ability. to get a better education, stimu 
lated the work of the teachers, and given a great impulse to educationa 
work in general. This was especially clear from the statistics of th 
number of Catholics receiving secondary education before and twent; 
years after the establishment of the examination. And finally th 
system was said to have stimulated parental interest, helped t 
raise the status and salaries of teachers, and given an enormo 
impetus to the education of girls. 
The board reported in 1899 and said that without legislation the 
were powerless to carry out their recommendations. Next ye 
Parliament by the intermediate education act gave them the nece 
sary liberty to draw up their own rules subject to the approval of t' 
lord lieutenant and Parliament, and power was given to appoii 
inspectors, which in the opinion of the board and of the gre 
majority of witnesses before the commission was necessary to su 
plement examination, inspection being taken in the opinion of t 
board to include the sanitary conditions of the school, reasonablene: 
of school hours, and proper provision when practical science w: 
taught. 
New regulations were issued in 1902, and candidates are able 
take, in three out of the four grades, either honors or pass pape: 
No one is eligible under 13 or over 19, and the first or preparato 
grade is only open to pupils under 15. An intermediate roll has 
be sent in by each head master containing the names of all pup: 
eligible by: age to compete. The examination was divided into t 
courses in 1902. They have since been expanded into five—t! 
classical, modern literary I (French or German, with Irish), mode: 
literary II (French and German), mathematics, and experimen 
science. English and mathematics are compulsory in all cours 
and other subjects have to be chosen by the candidates. 
In 1901 six temporary inspectors were appointed. Extracts fr 
their reports were published in 1902. They criticised the too excl] 
sive preparation made by the schools for the examination, the imp 
fect grading of the pupils, and the excessive number of schools in t 
same districts. They commented on the excellence of the discipli 
and the high conscientiousness of the teachers, but they spoke un 
vorably of the slowness of the teaching and the inaudibility of t 
pupils. The English teaching, in spite of sundry criticisms, 
praised for arousing interest. The history and geography w 
apparently taught on rather old-fashioned lines. The Latin a: 
Greek were pronounced to be good in the larger schools, but less s 
isfactory in the smaller. In modern languages the work in gramm:

ranslation, and composition was commended, but the colloquial side, 
r which no allowance was made in the examination, was naturally 
isappointing. In respect to mathematics and experimental science 
e inspectors stated ‘‘We can speak highly of the labor, patience, 
md care that have been bestowed on these subjects in the great 
ajority of schools.” The deficiency in competent science teachers 
as noted and the need of special supervision in that branch of the 
hool work. j 
Next year the experiment of sending out inspectors was renewed. 
eanwhile the results of their work were so satisfactory that the 
oard unanimously were of the opinion that “inspection should be 
once organized on a permanent footing,” but owing to the uncer- 
inty of the political situation nothing was done. To insure stand- 
dization of the examination from year to year eight permanent 
aminers were appointed. 
The backwardness of science teaching in Ireland, alluded to above, 
due to the somewhat checkered career that the teaching of the 
bject had previously experienced in Ireland. From the outset 
eland shared in the bounty of the science and art department on 
e same lines as Great Britain. In 1852 out of 20 art schools in the 
gdom Ireland had 2. In 1860 out of 87 subsidized schools Ire- 
nd had 8. In 1868 these schools had risen in number to 76, as 
ainst 16 in Scotland. The high-water mark was reached during 
e years 1887-1890. In 1889 the number of schools receiving 
ants was 342 and the total grant £8,836, or more than one-eleventh 
the whole grant for the Kingdom. It then fell away, until in 1897 
only amounted to £2,500 out of £172,000, or about one-seventieth 
the whole grant, the reason being that while South Kensington grad- 
lly ceased to subsidize national and night schools, the rules of the 
termediate board hindered the schools in working for the science and 
+ department. In 1899 the English science and art department was 
placed by act of Parliament by a department of agriculture and 
chnical instruction, of which the president was the chief secretary 
r Ireland. The vice-president is a paid official, and the first person 
fill the post was Mr. (since Sir) Horace Plunkett, to whom Irish 
riculture and Irish technical education owe so much. There is a 
meral council of agriculture and two advisory boards, one of which 
for technical education, while for coordinating educational admin- 
ration there is a small consultative committee, consisting of the 
lce-president and one representative each from the technical, agri- 
Itural, national, and intermediate boards. The fall in science was 
own by the fact that in 1891 there were 2,885 candidates in this sub- 
+ at the intermediate examinations. The number had decreased in 
99 to 673, and in 1901 there were only 6 laboratories in the secondary 
ools. The recovery was equally rapid, thanks to the efforts of

the new department. By the end of 1902, 101 permanent and 4 
provisional laboratories had been established, at a cost of £30,00! 
and summer courses were started on a large scale for teachers. 
| 1901-2 no less than 6,412 candidates took the first year in physi 
The intermediate board always lend a helping hand to managers 
making loans to enable them to provide proper equipment. The 
loans in 1904 had already amounted to over £16,000, and in ai 
after 1905 science was for some years made compulsory, with cel 
tain reservations, on all students save those taking the classic 
course. : 
In 1904 Mr. Dale, who had already reported on elementary educ 
tion, was commissioned, in conjunction with Mr. Stephens, anoth| 
inspector of the English board of education, to report on the syste 
of intermediate and technical education in Ireland—“ the latter 
far as it is connected with the former”—and “to ascertain whet! 
any organic or other changes in that system are desirable.” Th 
were specially to deal with coordination of intermediate with 
forms of education, primary, technical, and university; with t 
staffing, equipment, and sanitation of intermediate schools; with t: 
methods of allocating the funds of the board and the possibility 
making grants to selected schools; and with the possibility of est 
lishing a profession of intermediate teachers. As regards the la 
of coordination they pointed out the undue overlapping betwe| 
primary and intermediate schools, the deficiency in scholarships 
other means of helping on the poorer children to higher educati 
except in the case of the Christian Brothers and one or two ot 
bodies, and the shortage especially in the north of Ireland of inti 
mediate schools. This want of coordination they attributed to 
absence of any central department to survey the two systems a 
whole. They advocated the creation of scholarships tenable at int 
mediate schools for elementary and other children and mentio: 
with approval the scholarships given by eight counties under the a, 
cultural and technical department. They also praised the departm 
for the work it had carried out in cooperation with the interme 
ate board in erecting laboratories and reforming the teaching 
experimental science. The connection of the universities wi 
intermediate education was described as very imperfect. As 
remedy for the lack of coordination, they suggested a school-leavi 
certificate with a consultative committee. The premises and eq 
ment of the schools with over 65 boys and 52 girls were reported 
satisfactory, but this was not the case with two-thirds of the sma! 
schools. They found 55.3 per cent of the men and 30 per cent of 
women in Protestant schools had degrees, while the majority of theCa| 
olic teachers were in orders and had been trained at Maynooth or so 
Catholic institution of university rank. They noted the lowness of

salaries of assistants, the average in 70 boys’ schools being £82 6s. 7d. 
and in 47 girls’ schools, £48 2s. 7d. They commented on the excessive 
cost of administration and examination, which, however, was swollen 
in the year under review by the cost of the temporary inspection. It 
amounted to nearly £15,000, out of a total income of about £85,000. 
They asserted that a permanent inspectorate would not be a satis- 
factory remedy for current defects, unless more effective control, 
which legally seemed doubtful, could be exercised by the board over 
the schools, and the extent and cost of the examination were lessened 
at the same time. They recommended, therefore, an amendment 
of the acts, coupled with a block grant, an internal examination of 
each recognized school under the general supervision of the inspectors, 
and external examinations for the leaving certificates conducted by 
the central authority. They noted the absence of registration and 
proposed that teachers should avail themselves of the British reg- 
ister (since defunct), pointed out existing institutes for training in 
Treland, and suggested that salaries would best be raised by the adop- 
tion of registration and inspection. 
The abortive attempt has already been described which was made 
in 1907 to carry into effect by parliamentary enactment the admin- 
istrative reforms outlined by the report of Mr. Dale for primary 
education as well as those contained in the above report. It will 
be remembered that under this Irish council bill it was proposed to 
dissolve the intermediate board and the commissioners of national 
education and hand over primary and secondary education to an 
educational department or committee under the control and organi- 
zation of the council. The bill was withdrawn, and since then no 
urther effort has been made to coordinate Irish education or create 
local educational authorities. Next year the board at last received 
ermission to appoint six permanent inspectors, who were appointed 
in the following year. The result of the experiment will naturally be 
waited with great interest. Obviously, if inspection can be found 
o replace partially the examination, the worst tendencies of the 
stem of payment by results will be neutralized, such as the tempta- 
ion to neglect the weaker children and voluntary subjects not con- 
ained in the examination courses. The adoption of the two leaving 
ertificates as advocated by Messrs. Dale and Stephens and correspond- 
ng to the system already obtaining in Scotland seems a more or less 
ossible step. The elimination of the weaker teachers by means of 
egistration would probably enable, as Messrs. Dale and Stephens 
ave suggested, the better teachers to command better salaries. 
uch is in fact already the case with the teachers of science who are 
gistered by the technical department. It is curious to find that 
he course of Latin and modern languages, as noted by Doctor 
tarkie, is still lacking in the list of courses; yet its utility has fully

been proved in France and by the curriculum of the Real Gymnasium 
in Germany. 
A few statistics may be added here to show how fully, except 
for the condominium in science teaching that it shares with the 
department of agriculture and technical instruction, the interme- 
diate board has become the authority for secondary education. 
In 1903, 262 schools, with a school population of 12,135 boys and 
7,322 girls, were receiving grants from the board, while in 1901 (the 
latest census figures available) there were in the 475 so-called superior 
schools (excluding certain colleges and elementary schools) 26,760 
pupils (15,307 boys and 11,453 girls). In 1900, 6,093 boys and 
2,194 girls entered for the examination, or 8,287 in all. In 1908 
the numbers had risen to 8,283 boys and 3,906 girls, or 12,159 in all. 
The numbers who passed in 1900 and 1903 were 5,314 and 6,972, 
respectively, being 59.9 per cent of the boys and 63.9 per cent of the 
girls, or 61.2 per cent of the whole number. The total school grant 
was just under £50,000. The board’s income amounted to about 
£86,000. 
One word of caution is perhaps necessary to anyone seeking to 
appraise the work of the intermediate board. The inevitable ten- 
dency of all critics, especially among a critically minded people, and| 
of all commissions of inquiry, is to insist on the unsatisfactory rather] 
than on the satisfactory side—on what remains to be carried out rathe 
than on what is already accomplished. It may therefore be advis 
able to point out that when all has been said and done, the interme 
diate board in its thirty-odd years of existence may safely be credite: 
with two important services which must together outweigh the su 
total of all its defects, real or imaginary. It has practically, if no 
actually, called into being Catholic secondary education (compar 
statistics of 1878), and it has given an immense impetus to th 
intermediate education of girls.

The réle played by the science and art department in fosterin; 
these two subjects in Irish schools has been described elsewhere 
As has already been stated, the money available under the loca! 
taxation act of 1890, amounting in the case of Ireland to a variabl 
sum of about £128,000 a year, was handed over to the national an 
intermediate boards instead of being devoted to technical education| 
as in England and Scotland. The science and art department there} 
fore continued to give grants for the teaching of science and art unde 
the regulations of that department. In 1887-88 the total amount wa: 
about £7,000, of which £4,577 odd was contributed by the local autho: 
ities. Meanwhile a local, which later became a national, movemen 
was springing up in the country in favor of reviving and extendin,

   Trish agriculture and industries by means of education. A small 
committee was formed in Dublin to promote technical education 
in 1886. In 1887 the city of Dublin technical schools were opened. 
They were supported by voluntary contributions and a grant from 
the Dublin corporation under the library acts. In 1889 the first 
technical education act applicable to Ireland was passed, but Dublin, 
Galway, and Cork were practically the only places to avail themselves 
of it. The movement received a vigorous impetus from the forma- 
tion of the recess committee, in 1896, composed of members of all 
parties, which advocated the formation of a department of agricul- 
ture and industries. This, as has already been described, was 
created in 1899. Salaries and office expenses are provided by annual 
parliamentary vote. The department was set up with an income 
of about £166,000 a year, of which £55,000 was reserved for tech- 
nical instruction; £78,000 of this money represented the local tax- 
ation grant of 1890 hitherto paid to the national board, who now 
received in its place a yearly equivalent sum by House of Commons 
vote. In 1908-9 the endowment fund had risen to £180,000, of 
which £72,000 was available for education. The board also received 
under the act of 1899 capital to the extent of about £205,000; this 
in 1909 had been augmented by the unexpended cash balances, etc., 
and amounted to £285,288. Against this, liabilities had been 
incurred amounting to about £104,000. The department also 
continued to receive a sum (about.£7,000) in lieu of the equivalent 
grant, a compromise on the science and art grant. 
The agricultural side of the department’s work touches education 
at many points. It maintains an agricultural faculty in the Royal 
College of Science and Art and the Albert Agricultural College, 
Glasnevin, which gives training in horticulture as well, the Mun- 
ster Institute, and the Ulster Dairy School. The latter two 
are open only to women and give instruction in dairy work, feed- 
ing and management of cows, poultry keeping, agriculture, and 
domestic economy. Agriculture is further taught at the agricultural 
stations at Athenry, Ballyhaise, and Clonakilty. Agriculture and 
rural domestic economy are also taught at the ‘‘aided”’ agricultural 
college at Mount Bellew and at the nine schools of rural domestic 
economy, at Westport, Ramsgrange, Claremorris, etc. And finally 
there are the classes, lectures, and practical demonstrations carried 
lon by the itinerant instructors in agriculture, horticulture, poultry 
keeping, and butter making throughout the country. Classes for 
training qualified teachers of agricultural subjects have also been 
tablished at the Royal College of Science, at the Albert College, 
nd the Munster Institute. These trained teachers in 1908-9 num- 
lbered 123. The number of itinerant teachers numbered 128. Winter 
lasses in agriculture were formed in 1908-9 in 20 counties. There  
-P-A-G-E-576

were in all 50 classes, and 375 students were admitted. In 1901-2 
the agricultural board voted £3,000 for rural industries and technical 
instruction connected therewith. This in 1908-9 had grown to 
£9,000. Classes in lace and crochet making, basket making, and 
other rural industries are also financed by the agricultural board, 
at a cost in 1908-9 of £3,000. 
In 1908-9 the institutions maintained by the department under| 
the annual parliamentary vote were the Royal College of Science, 
the National Museum of Science and Art, the Metropolitan School 
of Art, and the Royal Botanical Gardens. The cost of these insti- 
tutions in 1908-9 was £44,292. 
The board of technical instruction is a body composed of th 
president, the vice-president of the department, fifteen representa. 
tives of local afithorities, one representative from the inter. 
mediate and national boards, respectively, and four persons nomi 
nated by the department. 
The whole policy of the department is based on the principle o 
helping those who help themselves and the congested districts wer 
expressly excluded from its purview in 1902, though it has late 
taken over some of the agricultural work of the congested distric 
board. In accordance with this policy the department was prohib: 
ited from applying any of its funds (except in special cases) t 
schemes in respect of which aid was not given out of money pro 
vided by local authorities or from other local sources. Every urba: 
district council and every county council may raise a twopenn 
rate to be applied to technical institutions in towns and to technical 
instruction and the fostering of agriculture and rural industries i 
the country. They may also borrow money for building purposes} 
The local authorities formulate schemes for their districts whic! 
must be approved by the department. This has allowed of a cer| 
tain diversity between town and country districts, as well as per 
mitting the erection of purely commercial schools in Rathmines an 
Cork in addition to the ordinary technical school in the latter cit; 
The £55,000 income was divided into two parts; £25,000 was give 
to the six county boroughs (Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Limerick, Londo: 
derry, and Waterford), to be applied in aid of technical schem: 
approved by the department. This has scarcely varied at all (gr: 
in 1909-10 being £26,000). The remaining £30,000 (£29,000 i 
1909-10) was expended by the department on technical instruction i 
urban and country districts, while £4,000 of it is set aside for centr: 
purposes (senior scholarships, teachers’ classes, etc.). Grants amoun 
ing to three-fourths of the approved expenditure are made to sp 
cial trade preparatory schools in Belfast, Portadown, Pembroke, Kil 
kenny, and Queenstown. In 1902-3 27 county schemes and 24 urba 
schemes were more or less fully in operation, together with those of t

5 county boroughs, and in 1903-4 the total raised by rates was esti- 
mated at £25,000, of which, roughly, half came from the counties 
und half from the county boroughs. This amount came to £29,- 
302 odd in 1908-9. Every county in Ireland contributed, and the 
otal included over 70 urban and rural districts. It is interesting to 
note that in 1902 it was estimated a 1d. rate all over Ireland would 
roduce a little under £60,000. 
In 1906 a committee of inquiry was appointed to inquire into the 
orking of the department. The report on the whole was favorable | 
o the department. 
The last report, 1908-9, speaks of the work while still extending, 
aving entered on a phase of consolidation. The rapid development 
f technical education is attributed to the substitution of inspection 
r examination and the facilities afforded by the department for the 
raining of teachers. The new regulations for technical schools, 
ith their increased grants and demand for higher standard of 
ficiency, are stated to have been very beneficial. The cooperation 
f employers has been increasingly secured. The schools of com- 
erce are flourishing, but the question of suitable buildings is a 
rious one. Hygiene and home nursing have been added during 
e last two years to the domestic economy in rural districts. 
In the secondary schools the teaching of the department’s pro- 
ramme is maintained efficiently and harmoniously. Domestic 
onomy as a subject is growing in girls’ schools. The summer 
urses for teachers were attended by 622 teacher-students, and 523 
ceived certificates; 113 national teachers presented themselves for 
amination in elementary experimental science and 67 received 
rtificates. A large number of scholarships to the intermediate, 
ade, domestic economy schools, and to the Royal College of Science 
d to the Metropolitan School of Art were awarded, as well as 
rtain local exhibitions. One of the most promising developments 
the department is the encouragement offered during the last three 
ars under its revised regulations to technical schools in technology, 
ndicraft, commerce, applied science, and art. Other interesting 
partures are the two schools it has established, one for training in 
mestic economy and one for instructors and domestic servants. 
lhe amount allocated for the session 1907-8 to technical schools was 
15,805, while the secondary schools for experimental science, drawing, 
anual instruction, and domestic economy received £26,725, and the 
imary schools for drawing and manual instruction £1,819. In 1908-9 
e grant to the technical schools was £18,952. In the forthcoming 
ar it will be probably oyer £22,000. These moneys are derived from 
e science and art grant, which in 1897-98 had sunk to £2,613, but 
s since been rapidly growing, especially in recent years. In 1906-7 
amounted to £26,400. It was £37,550 in 1907-8, and in 1908-9 it 
d risen to £43,600.

  570 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
UNIVERSITY. 
The early beginnings of Irish university and secondary educatio: 
have already been described (see secondary section). The tote 
destruction of higher education commenced, as we have seen, by th 
repeated inroads of the Danes, and, completed by the long drawnou 
struggle of the Anglo-Norman conquest, left a blank which was no 
filled up till the foundation of Trinity College in 1591. It is true tha 
Archbishop Leck attempted to found a university in Dublin in 1311 
and an act of Parliament was passed in 1465 for establishing a univer 
sity at Drogheda, while Pope Sixtus IV issued a bull for founding 
university in Dublin in 1475. But these attempts bore little fruit, an 
the Dublin University, such as it was, perished at the time of t 
confiscation of the monasteries. 
Trinity College was founded by charter by Queen Elizabeth. 
was built on the site of the old suppressed Augustinian monaste 
of All Hallows near Dublin and was opened to students in 1593. T. 
college was described in the charter as ‘‘Unum Collegium Mat 
Universitatis,’ but no other college has ever been established, so th: 
the university and the college became practically identical. It is 
moot point whether it was originally intended for the whole popul 
tion or only for a denominational section, but as things turned o 
it was exclusively Protestant for two hundred years, except during 
brief period in the reign of James II, who appointed a Catholic 
provost. 
The college was admittedly founded in imitation of Oxford a: 
Cambridge, and, as a matter of fact, the first four provosts we 
Cambridge men. 
Certain confiscated lands in the north and £2,000 collected 
money formed the first endowment. 
The government consisted of the provost and the fellows (later 
the senior fellows only). In 1615 James I gave the college the rig 
to return two members to Parliament. In 1637 Charles I grant 
a new charter, resuming for the crown the right of making statut 
The statutes then issued, with certain modifications, lasted till t: 
times of modern reform. 
The first provision for medical education was made outside Trini 
in 1667, when a charter of incorporation was granted to the Ro 
College of Physicians. It was incorporated under the title of t 
King’s and Queen’s College in 1692. Under legislation in 1741 a 
later, four King’s professors of medicine in Trinity were created; th 
election, however, was placed in the hands of the Royal College 
Physicians. There were also faculties of law and medicine, and 
1776 two royal chairs of modern languages were founded. In 16] 
the first school of engineering in the Kingdom was established 
Trinity.

   Up to 1794 the university was closed to Catholics and Dissenters, 
ough the presence of a few was tolerated. After that date the 
niversity was thrown open to both. They were not, however, 
lowed to hold office in the university. 
There was an outburst of educational activity during the last two 
ecades of the eighteenth century. The Royal College of Surgeons was 
corporated in 1784 and opened as a licensing and teaching institu- 
on. The astronomical observatory at Dunsink, created in 1785, 
as placed in 1791 under the care of the royal astronomer of Ireland. 
he Apothecaries’ Hall was incorporated in 1791 and the Royal 
ish Academy in 1786. Barristers are admitted by the King’s Inns 
concurrence with the law school of Trinity College, a scheme that 
cording to the commission of 1906-7 has worked well. 
In 1795, owing to the destruction of the ecclesiastical colleges in 
rance, the Irish Parliament passed an act appointing trustees for 
dowing an academy for Catholics only and giving an annual grant 
£8,000. This was the origin of the celebrated College of Maynooth. 
lay college was attached to it in 1800 for boys over 14, but it was 
scontinued in 1817. Its failure is attributed by Doctor Starkie 
the fact that it had no ‘‘root fibers in a system of primary and 
condary schools.” Maynooth was incorporated in 1845, when the 
nual grant was raised to £26,360 and provision was made for 520 
udents, a sum of £30,000 being given for building. On the dis- 
tablishment of the Irish church Maynooth received a lump sum of 
69,040 in lieu of the annual grant. 
The Presbyterians received, about the same time as the foundation 
Maynooth, a grant for the education of their ministers. In 1814 
ey opened the Belfast Academical Institute, which later became the 
meral Assembly’s Theological College at Belfast. Their grant, 
ich was £1,500 in 1828, was £2,500 in 1849, and at the disestab- 
hment it was commuted to £48,976, and £15,000 was given for 
ildings. 
In 1845 Sir Robert Peel passed an act providing for the establish- 
lent of three Queen’s colleges ‘‘in order to supply the want which 
d long been felt in Ireland for an improved academical education, 
ually accessible to all classes of the community without religious 
tinction.” The scheme itself goes back to the report of the select 
mmittee of 1838, and was really due to its indefatigable chair- 
n, Mr. Wyse, the moving spirit in all educational reform, whether 
mentary or secondary, during the first half of the nineteenth cen- 
ry; £100,000 was granted for sites and buildings at Belfast, Cork, 
d Galway, and each college received £7,000 a year. The colleges 
re strictly undenominational. Three faculties were established 
each, arts, law, and physics. They were opened in 1849, and in 
50 the Queen’s University was founded to act as an examining

   university for degree students from these colleges. The latt 
opened in 1849 with 223 matriculated students, 63 being Establish 
Church Protestants, 80 Catholics, and 80 Presbyterians and Di 
senters. It was provided by the act that the visitors of the colleg 
should represent the several religious persuasions, but the Rom 
Catholic ecclesiasts refused to serve. Next year, at a plenary syn 
of the Catholic hierarchy held at Thurles, the new Queen’s colleg 
were definitely condemned and it was resolved to found a Cathol 
university in Ireland at the suggestion of the Pope. 
A royal commission on Trinity College was appointed in 18 
which reported that the income amounted to £62,000, while fees 
1850 brought in over £3,000. There were 1,217 undergraduates 
the books. The commissioners found the general state of the u 
versity satisfactory. Certain internal reforms were proposed, ma: 
of which were adopted in 1857. 
Meanwhile the proposals of the Thurles synod were realized 
1854 by the foundation of a ‘Catholic University of Ireland| 
modeled on the University of Louvain. The first rector w| 
Doctor Newman, afterwards Cardinal Newman. Between 1851-18 
£125,000 was collected and an additional £59,000 by 1874. T 
fees were almost nominal, salaries came to £5,000 out of a to 
annual cost of £6,000. In 1879 the funds were nearly exhaust

In 1866 Alexandra College was founded for the higher education 
women, and a residence house opened, and in 1870 the University 
Dublin held its first examination for women. 
In 1867 the government of the day removed the religious d| 
abilities attached to the holding of certain chairs in Dublin U: 
versity, and in 1873 all tests were abolished except for the divinj 
professors and lecturers. Early in 1873 Mr. Gladstone brought 
a bill to solve the Irish university difficulty. He described the U. 
versity of Dublin as being in servitude to a single college. ‘ 
means servitude to eight gentlemen who elect the other fellows, w| 
elect also themselves, and who govern both the university and 
college.” He proposed a new Irish national university composed 
Trinity, the Catholic University, Magee College, and the Queen’s ¢| 
leges of Belfast and Cork. The theological faculty in Trinity was to

recognition without endowment to the Catholic University, and the 
measure was lost by three votes on the second reading. 
In 1879 the Queen’s University was replaced by the Royal Uni- 
versity of Ireland. In 1883 the annual grant rose from £5,000 to 
£20,000 a year, the university receiving for the first time its full 
income from the funds of the disestablished church. The new charter, 
issued in 1880, gave power to confer degrees in all faculties except 
theology. No residence or attendance at lectures (except for medical 
tudents) was required. The religious difficulty was thus shelved 
land Catholics readily availed themselves of the examination and 
ccepted office in the new university. In debatable subjects like 
hilosophy, alternative sets of questions were set by examiners 
hosen respectively from Catholics and Protestants. 
The corporation consisted of a chancellor, senate, and graduates. 
wenty-nine arts and eight medical fellowships were created, as 
ell as scholarships and prizes. By a tacit understanding half of 
hese fellowships were given to the Queen’s colleges, with the excep- ~ 
ion of one, which was assigned to Magee College, the remaining half 
eing given to the University College, Stephens Green, which took 
ver the buildings of the former Catholic University, the new Catholic 
niversity consisting henceforth of the above college, together with 
aynooth, Blackrock, Carlow, Clonliffe, and the Catholic Medical 
chool. 
In 1882 the classes and scholarships in the Queen’s colleges were 
hrown open to women, while as regards the Royal University 
omen were from the first placed on an equality with men. The 
ttendances at the Queen’s colleges fluctuated considerably. Their 
aximum numbers were reached in the early eighties. Thus at 
elfast in 1881-82 there were 567 students, of whom 353 were Pres- 
yterians and 25 Catholics. These in 1899-1900 had sunk to 347, of 
hom 247 were Presbyterians. Cork had 402 in 1881-82 (with 221 
atholics). In 1900-1901 it had only 171 (98 Catholics). Galway 
ad 208 (87 Catholics) in 1881-82. In 1898-99 there were only 83 
f whom 28 were Catholics). Many of the above students were 
hibitioners and scholars. Thus at Galway in 1900-1901 they 
umbered 56 out of 84 matriculated students. 
The Queen’s University had 302 candidates for examination in 
870 and 748 in 1880. The Royal examined 2,364 candidates in 
884 and 2,658 in 1900. In 1896-97 the Catholic college, Stephens 
reen, Dublin, with only 130 pupils obtained 49 first-class distinctions 
the examinations, as against 33 for all the Queen’s colleges. The 
lumber of degrees taken by women was 9 in 1884 and 65 in 1900. 
1901 the number of students at Maynooth was 504, at Magee 70, and 
the General Assembly’s Theological College 46.

574 EDUCATION REPORT, 1910. 
Trinity College is partly a residential and partly an examining 
university. It was stated that in 1891 less than 20 per cent of the 
students obtained degrees by examination only. The largest num- 
ber on its books during the last century was 1,338 in 1881; of these 
115 were Roman Catholics. In 1894 there were only 1,063, and in 
1901 the numbers had sunk to 976. It is estimated of 1,200 student: 
who matriculated between 1891 and 1895 only 6 per cent wer 
Catholics. 
The Catholic position was excellently put by Archbishop Wals: 
in 1890: “To all Catholics it comes as a fixed principle that eve: 
institution such as Trinity College, embodying what is known 
the ‘mixed system’ is from the nature of that system a source o 
danger to Catholic students if they frequent it; a source of dange 
to the vigor and even the integrity of their faith; a source of dange: 
also to their constancy in the full and faithful observances of th 
practical duties by which they are bound as Catholics.” 
In July, 1901, a royal commission was appointed “to inquire inti 
the present position of higher general and technical education in Ir 
land, outside of Trinity College, and to report as to what reforms, i 
necessary, are desirable in order to render that education adequat 
to the needs of the Irish people.” The final report was signed by 1 
out of the 12 commissioners, with sundry reservations. The co 
missioners. considered that the present arrangement by whic 
degrees of the Royal University were obtainable by examinatio: 
alone had lowered the ideal of university life and education in Ir 
land and should be abolished. It insisted that the Royal Un 
versity should be converted into a teaching university, in whic 
attendance at lectures should be indispensable for degrees. TT! 
Queen’s colleges should be the constituent colleges of the universit 
together with a fourth, Catholic, college in Dublin. Belfast shoul 
be liberally endowed and equipped, but Cork and Galway we 
rather to be reduced. 
In December, 1903, Trinity College was thrown open to wome' 
and those who had taken the necessary examinations elsewhe 
were also admitted to degrees “ad eundum.’’ This latter privile, 
was only continued till the end of 1907, but no less than 800 wome 
mainly from Oxford and Cambridge, availed themselves of it, ai 
the fees thus received, some £16,000, were set aside by the colle 
for the promotion of women’s education. 
Statistics issued by the three Queen’s colleges in 1907 showed 
steady recovery from the low figures of 1900-1901. Thus in 19 
Belfast had 390 students. Its teaching staff had also been mu 
strengthened, and numbered 40, as against 20 in 1887, and 8 n 
laboratories had been added. Galway reported 111 students a 
Cork 265, of whom 179 were Roman Catholics. The principal

he latter also renewed the claims of Cork to be made a separate 
niversity for Munster, and referred to the offer of £50,000 under 
ertain conditions from Mr. W. O’Brien and his wife. 3 
Meanwhile, the report of the commission of 1903, though its gen- 
ral conclusion of a federal university proved inacceptable, made 
lhe solution of the university question seem more pressing than 
ver. In March, 1906, the Government announced its intention to 
ppoint a royal commission on Trinity College. According to the 
rish secretary, Mr. James Bryce, it was to “deal with the revenues 
f the college, with its government and administration, with the 
leaching staff, with the system of examinations and rewards. A 
eneral consideration of the place Trinity College ought to occupy in 
e higher education of Ireland, so that it might become more useful 
the people of Ireland at large than perhaps it was at the moment, 
lould not be excluded.’’ The terms of reference bore out the Irish 
cretary’s prognostications, and the full title of the commission 
pointed in June, 1906, was Royal Commission on Trinity College, 
blin, and the University of Dublin. The commission was further 
powered to take cognizance of the reports and evidence received 
the commission of 1901. 
The commission issued its final report in 1907. The commis- 
oners reported that Trinity College was a satisfactory organ for 
rotestant Episcopalian education, but not for Roman Catholic. 
our commissioners were in favor of a federal university, composed 
Trinity, a suitable Catholic college in Dublin, and the three 
ueen’s colleges. Another favored the solution, but doubted its 
ccess from the hostility of the colleges concerned. Three com- 
issioners favored a reconstitution of the Royal as a teaching uni- 
rsity, composed of the three Queen’s colleges and a new Catholic 
llege in Dublin, and one, the representative of Trinity and a 
tholic, was against the creation of any new college. Thus, while 
e commission was practically equally divided on the question of 
modeling Dublin University or not, an overwhelming majority 
las in favor of the creation of a new college in Dublin acceptable 
Catholics. No changes in the constitution of Trinity could be 
commended which would make it acceptable to Catholics, but 
tercollegiate cooperation was recommended between Trinity and 
e new proposed college, and the offer made by Trinity of special 
rangements for Catholics, Presbyterians, and Methodists was to be 
cluded in the new statutes. 
It was recommended that the governing body of Trinity should be 
odeled. The existing governing body was to furnish one-fourth 
e members, half were to be elected by the fellows and professors from 
ong the fellows, and a fourth from the professors who were not fel- 
s. In place of the council there was to be an academic council

   and boards of studies. Hitherto the fellows had been elected bj 
examination, which involved, as a rule, much laborious work for se 
eral years after full graduation. As a permissible alternative t 
commisisoners recommended the presentation of a thesis or oth 
original work. It was reported that the cooperation between the La 
School and the King’s Inns had been advantageous. More encourag 
ment was to be given to Irish and the prosecution of research wor 
The office of lady registrar should be made permanent. The rig 
of recognizing lady teachers in any college for women within t! 
30-mile radius was to be granted to the college. 
On March 31, 1908, Mr. Birrell, who had succeeded Mr. Bryce 
Irish secretary, introduced a bill giving force to many of the 
recommendations. ‘Trinity College was left alone. Two new w 
versities were to be founded, one at Belfast, the other to comprii 
Cork and Galway, with a new college in Dublin. The Royal U: 
versity was to be dissolved. There were to be no religious tests f 
professors, lecturers, fellows, or students, no state endowment 
theology or for building or maintaining places of worship, the latt| 
to be provided, if desired, by private enterprise. The universiti 
were to be governed by senates, nominated at first provisionally f 
a term of years, but hereafter to be elected for the most part a 
demically. Women were to be represented upon them. The u 
versities were to have the power of admitting to their examinatio 
and degrees the matriculated students of any “recognized”’ colle 
This, as it afterwards appeared, was meant to refer to Magee a 
Maynooth. No external students were to be admitted to exami 
tions. This latter condition was not to the liking of the natio 
teachers, who saw that they would largely be cut off from taki 
degrees in the new university. 
The bill passed the second reading by an overwhelming major 
and was “warmly supported”’ by the Nationalist members, most 
the criticism it received in Parliament coming from the Protest 
members for Ulster. 
The third reading was passed on July 27, and the bill recei 
royal assent. : 
In summing up the main features of the measure the Journal 
Education says: 
“To an outsider situated between the two opposing camps 
Irish religious and political beliefs the measure seems to be about 
colorless as it is possible to make it. The absence of religious te 
the exclusion of the clergy from ex officio representation on the g:

wholly to private endowment, would seem to be the only safeguai

onal, denominational it will be, in spite of all the acts of Parliament 
the world.” 
By the financial clauses of the act Galway was allotted an annual 
ant of £12,000, Cork of £20,000, Dublin £32,000, and Belfast 
18,000. The original endowment of the Royal was divided between 
e two universities, whose total income (colleges included) was thus 
5,000, against £35,000 before the act; £60,000 was given for 
ilding to Belfast and £170,000 to Dublin. By letters patent 
ued December 2, 1908, the new university in Dublin received the 
le of National University of Ireland, and Queen’s College, Belfast, 
s rechristened Queen’s University, Belfast. New statutes were 
ued on May 24, 1909, for the two universities and the constituent 
lleges. In the National University the senate elects the vice- 
ancellor and appoints and dismisses all professors, lecturers, etc. 
academic matters it is assisted by boards of studies. Convoca- 
m which elects the chancellor comprises the officers and senate of 
le university and all graduates, including those of the Royal who 
y a fee. Women are eligible. There are eight faculties: Arts, 
ilosophy and sociology, Celtic studies, science, law, medicine, 
gineering and architecture, and commerce. ' Agriculture is included 
der science and Irish under arts. There are diplomas in agricul- 
e, journalism, hygiene, etc. The senate may recognize colleges 
a university type, provided no secondary education is given ‘in 
m. 
At Belfast, in addition to the senate, there is an academic council 
control internal affairs and a general board of studies. The stu- 
nts have a council to represent their interests. Convocation is 
en to all graduates, including women. ‘There are four faculties: 
ts, science (including engineering and architecture), law, and 
dicine. Scholastic philosophy is included under arts. This has 
eady been attacked in the House of Commons and before the 
vy council as violating the undenominational character of the 
iversity, but the petition against its inclusion was dismissed by 
privy council in October, 1909. The matter has been revived 
a final settlement has evidently not yet been reached. 
horty after the passing of the act a strong agitation sprang up 
h a view of making Irish compulsory for entrance in the National 
iversity. Early in 1909 the Episcopal standing committee of the 
kh hierarchy issued a statement deprecating compulsory Gaelic 
proving not only a hindrance to the language movement but as 
ly also to drive away students. The Irish Nation declared, on 
other hand, that the issue was between a substitute for Oxford 
Cambridge and a democratic and national university. The Gaelic 
ue naturally took a very prominent part, as well as many of 
urban and district councils and the county councils, and in June,

1909, their demands were indorsed by the general council of the Iris 
county councils. By October 1, 130 urban and. district councils an 
23 county councils had pronounced in favor of compulsory Iris 
Many of the councils threatened to refuse to strike a rate in suppo 
of university education if their demands were not complied with. 
Meanwhile, in July, 1909, Magee College, which it was expecte 
would apply for recognition to Belfast, decided to accept affiliatio 
with Trinity College. On November 1 the new universities cam 
into official existence. The fees at the National University were fixe 
at £10 a year for arts, £12 for engineering, and £14 for science an 
medicine. On February 23, 1910, St. Patrick’s College, Maynoot! 
was admitted to recognition by the senate of the National Unive: 
sity. In the early part of the same year the question of the recog: 
tion of the women’s colleges also came to the front. But the petitio 
of Alexandra College to Trinity College for recognition of certain 
its lectures for university purposes was rejected. A similar reque 
from certain of the women’s colleges to the new University Colleg 
Dublin, was likewise refused. On the other hand, no provision h 
been made in the new Dublin College for technological subjects; 
seems not improbable that the Royal College of Science will ult 
mately be recognized for such courses. 
On April 6 Mr. Birrell stated in the House of Commons that t 
number of students in the new University College, Dublin, was 4 
(including 39 women). 
The agitation in favor of compulsory Irish at the National Unive 
sity continued with unabated vigor through the first six months 
1910. On May 5 the senate decided to make a course in Irish co 
pulsory for those who did not take it at matriculation. This sol 
tion proved unacceptable to publie opinion, and after a “long su: 
pense,” to use Archbishop Walsh’s words, the senate finally decid 
to make Irish compulsory in and after 1913. The decision th 
arrived at will insure from the county council alone, an income 
£8,000 to £9,000 a year. The adoption of compulsory Irish mea 
that the new university is assured of aid from the coun 
councils alone of something between £8,000 and £9,000 a ye 
The final decision was arrived at at the end of June, and Arc 
bishop Walsh attributed the long delay in part to the feder 
nature of the university, which, owing to the distances separati 
the different colleges, makes the work cumbrous and costly. It see 
quite possible that Cork, as Doctor Windle, its president, has late’ 
predicted, may retire from the Federal University and become 
independent university for Munster. It has quite recently receiv 
a sum of £10,000, and the offer of Mr. W. O’Brien of £50,000 
always available. If this happens the National University will 
only following in the footsteps of the Victoria University in Englan 
whose three former members, Manchester, Liverpool, and Lee 
are to-day all independent universities.

  The year was marked by three international congresses pertaining to recent developments in respect to 
welfare of the young. Many private agencies have been called into existence in the United States by the 
id spread of interest in thesubject to which these congresses relate, and, as already stated in this report, 
proposition to hold the Fourth International Congress on Home Education in the United States has 
n adopted by the organizing committee of the congress. To mect the inquiries which this decision will 
urally excite, together with demands for information on the kindred subjects of school hygiene and phys-

    gress was held at Milan in 1906, in connection with the international 
exposition that celebrated the completion of the Simplon tunne 
through the Alps. (For an account of this congress see the Annual 
Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1906.) 
The recent. meeting at Brussels was attended by more than 2,00 
members, representing practically all the civilized countries of thi 
world. The.congress was organized by a commission selected by th 
Belgian Government, and the officers selected at Milan, in coopera: 
tion with international committees appointed by foreign govern 
ments. Mrs. Lucie Félix-Faure Goyau, of France, was the presiden 
of the congress, Mr. Paul De Vuyst, of Brussels, vice-president, an 
Mr. Louis Pien, of Brussels, secretary. Nineteen foreign govern 
ments were represented on the international commission. 
In addition to the general meetings of the congress, special sec 
tional meetings were held for the discussion of particular topics 
The first section concerned itself with matters touching the study o 
* children (pédologie). Nine topics were selected as the basis of th 
papers and discussions of the section. The first question touche 
upon the general mental characteristics of children, their tendencie 
and faults. H. Thiselton Mark, of the University of Mancheste: 
England, discussed the instinctive tendencies of children, which li 
on the border land between the mental and physical. He pointe 
out that the child’s instincts are his inherited power to grapple wit 
the world and to use its resources; that the instincts being psych 
physical organisms, all acquisition must be based upon their us 
and that the school must not interrupt normal development of thi 
instincts. Miss Theda Gildemeister, of the State Normal School 
Winona, Minn., presented some of the mental traits of children t 
be developed in instruction in reading. Biography and autobi 
graphical literature were recommended for their wealth of ideals an 
varied types of character which should be presented to children durin 
the preadolescent period. Professor Claviére, of the Jean-Bart Co 
lege, Dunkerque, France, presented an interesting genetic study o 
the faults of children based upon the returns of a questionnair 
Children were asked to name (1) their own chief faults and (2) t 
faults of their classmates. Their own faults they attribute (1) 
thoughtlessness, (2) to timidity, (3) to idleness, (4) to obstinacy, a: 
(5) to impulsiveness. It was interesting to note that 47 per cent 
the boys questioned thought their faults due to thoughtlessnes 
while only 15 per cent of the faults in their fellows were attributed 
this cause. Thirty-one per cent of the faults in colleagues wei 
attributed to idleness, while less than 7 per cent of the boys thoug 
idleness a cause of their own misdemeanors. 
Five papers were presented on the methods of studying childre 
the most significant contribution being that. of Dr. I. Ioteyk

lirector of the psychological laboratory in the University of Brus- 
els. She pointed out the need of standards in testing children, and 
f the use of instruments and appliances that might give accurate 
ind definite results. The ergograph of Mosso she thought of special 
alue, and she recommended the use of the dynamometer and other 
struments that give graphic results. Doctor Ensch, of Brussels, 
alled attention to the need of more definite anthropometric tests of 
hildren, and Doctor Herderschée, of Amsterdam, gave the results 
f measurement of the cranium of 1,000 school children and the cor- 
lation of the results with the mental ability of the pupils. Papers 
y Mrs. Nadine Koschkine, of the University of Grenoble, France, 
md Dr. Joseph O. Vertes, of Budapest, dealt with instruments, 
ethods, and results in the study of the memories of children 
Russia and Hungary. 
Methods of studying mental fatigue were discussed by Doctor 
amelincke, of Ghent; Professor Van Wayenburg, of the University 
Amsterdam, and Mr. P. Michaux, of Brussels. The speakers con- 
dered the various methods in current use in determining the power 
endurance of children; they indicated faults in each of the well- 
own methods, and urged the development of new methods which. 
ight obviate the objections to the extensively used direct and indi- 
ct methods of the Germans, French, and Italians. 
The problem of child suicide, and its scientific study, occupied one 
ssion of the child-study department. It was the judgment of the 
ction that the recent German report on the subject gave undue 
ominence to the school as a cause of self-destruction among children. 
ne physical condition of the child and his home environment, 
gether with religious training and social relations, it was urged, were 
t sufficiently considered in the German study. 
Mrs. Frederic Schoff, president of the Mothers’ Congress in the 
ited States, presented a paper dealing with the causes of crime 
ong normal children. Among the causes, based upon a study of 
89 juvenile delinquents, the following were enumerated: Drunk- 
mess of parents, disorganized homes (separation of parents), poverty 
the family, and habits of truancy. Mrs. Schoff thought the most 
portant step in the reduction of juvenile crime among normal 
ildren was the education of the parents. She believed that it was 
re important that education of parents concerning child develop- 
nt and care be made compulsory than laws for the compulsory 
endance of children at school. 
General questions touching family education were brought before 
second section of the congress. Ten topics had been formulated 
the groundwork of the 58 papers and addresses, including ‘‘Char- 
er and need of parents’ associations,’ ‘‘Control of the child’s 
ding in the home,’ ‘‘The family and the peace movement,”

‘Moral and civic instruction in the home,’’ ‘‘Problem of domesti 
science,” ‘“‘Modern language study in the home,” ‘‘The home as 
factor in the choice of the child’s occupation,” ‘‘Hygiene and ssthe 
ies of clothing,” and ‘‘Agriculture and the rural home.” -A significan 
paper was that of Mrs. Fannie Fern Andrews, of Boston, on ‘‘Th 
union of the school and the family.”’ She gave an account of th 
Boston Home and School Association and outlined its numerou 
civic, social, and educational activities. Such associations, sh 
pointed out, composed of the men and women whose children wer 
in the schools, brought about an understanding between parents an 
teachers that greatly facilitated the work of teaching and furthere 
progressive reform movements. Among other values of the a: 
ciations were higher standards in the home, increased responsibilit: 
of parents, and the development of a community life that unified al 
the endeavors for the good of the community. 
Miss Winifred Gibbs gave an account of ‘‘Home education i 
proper feeding in New York City,”’ and outlined the methods of socia 
workers in instructing poor women and girls in their own kitchen: 
how to utilize the materials of food at hand so that a maximum o| 
strength might be obtained from a minimum of outlay in the way o| 
money. Mrs. J. Scott Anderson told the congress of the working} 
of the Philadelphia Home and School League, and Miss Charlotte 
Mason of the Parents’ National Educational Union in Great Britai 
Both these papers indicated some of the practical means that wer 
being employed in America and England to bring the home and th 
school into sympathetic cooperation. 
The home value of play was the subject of a paper by Miss Alic| 
Ravenhill, of Kings College for Women, England, and the contr 
of the home reading of the child was presented by Miss Pauli 
Herber, of Boppard, Germany; Charles L. Wesseling, of Haarle 
Holland; Edouard Froidure, of Ypres, Belgium; the Abbé Soulang 
Sodin, of Paris, France; D. Tikhomirof, of Moscow, Russia; and 
Merchier, of Lille, France. Several of the speakers deplored the lac| 
of suitable books for young people and the absence of supervision 
the book lists of the young. It was clear from the discussion th 
most of the European countries are distinctly behind the Unite 
States in the matter of library facilities for young people. 
Prof. C. H. Spence, of Clifton College, England, in presenting t 
question of the home in relation to civic instruction, maintained th 
the family was the unit of civic life, and that the discussion of pub 
questions in the family should lay the foundation of civic trainii 
and develop such civic virtues as patriotism and public spirit, rigi 
honesty and a high sense of honor in money matters, a love of fa 
play and good temper, and respect for the motives and opinions 
political opponents. Mr. Charles Rossignol, of Brussels, follow

with a paper on the réle of the family in propagating doctrines of 
peace. 
Seven papers were devoted to the subject of the family as a factor 
in the moral education of the child, and here, as in several of the 
other sections, the question of moral education called forth some of 
the liveliest discussion of the congress. Gustave Spiller, president 
of the International Union of Ethical Societies of London, gave the 
first paper of the series. Moral education in the family he thought 
should be made more concrete. The Abbé Simon, of Grand-Leez, 
Belgium, indicated five ways in which the family might influence the 
moral education of the child—the example of the parents, the forma- 
tion of good habits in the child, correction for faults and unmoral acts, 
the selection of the right kind of a school, and the close supervision 
lof the child during the times when he is not in the home. Several 
lof the speakers did not think that the moral education of the child 
could be separated from religion. 
Mrs. Fannie L. Lachmund, of the Teachers’ College at St. Louis, 
©., presented a paper on the conservation of the intellectual life 
f the people through the development of vocational interests and 
fficiency; George Blondel, ‘of Paris, on the extension of economic 
nowledge in the home; A. Spreng, of Berne, Switzerland, on the 
rganization of special courses for the study of popular economic 
uestions; M. Boufroy, of Villers-Bretonneux, France, and Walter 
ippmann, of England, on the study of modern languages in the 
ome by conversational methods; the study in the home of the 
hildren’s natural aptitudes and their development with a view to 
hoosing a career, by Henry C. Divine, of England; Dr. L. Sissingh, 
f Holland, and Mr. Audollent, of France. 
The question of family instruction on matters of sex was excellently 
resented by Prof. Edmond Goblot, of the University of Lyon; Prof. 
. Malapert, of the Lycée Louis le Grand, Paris, and Mr. Jules Renault, 
£ Woluwe-Saint-Lambert, Belgium. It was the opinion of the 
peakers that the home was the proper place to impart instruction 
oncerning matters of sex to children, but it was urged that to accom- 
lish this result satisfactorily scientific courses should be organized 
x fathers and mothers that they might themselves be properly 
structed with reference to the hygiene and pathology of sex and 
ight be given some pedagogic instruction with reference to methods 
f presenting such knowledge to children. It was pointed out that 
nowledge of the right sort, and given at the proper time, was the 
fest guarantee of the purity of the child. Mr. Renault furnished 
In extended bibliography of works in French calculated to aid parents 
the matter of sex instruction. Professor Goblot maintained that 
struction in matters of sex was the foundation of moral education, 
dhe deplored the prudery that excluded the functions of the organs

of reproduction from lessons in ethics and religion. The approach to 
the moral betterment of the race he thought must begin with sexual 
morality in family education. 
The improvement of family life in rural communities was the sub- 
ject of a half dozen excellent papers. Mr. C. Mallien-Goreux, of Bier- 
wart, Belgium, pointed out the advantages of country life for the 
education of the child, and he lamented the drift toward the cities. 
Physically and morally the rural districts furnish the best environment 
for the child. Statistics show that crime increases and that the race 
grows physically weaker in consequence of urban residence. He 
advocated the establishment of agricultural schools throughout the 
rural districts and the inculcation of doctrines of simpler living. Mr. 
Paul De Vuyst, vice-president of the congress and inspector of agri- 
culture in the Belgian ministry, presented a thoughtful and forceful 
paper on the professional education of the farmer and the improvement 
of conditions of life in rural communities. He traced the economic} 
betterment of Belgian farmers through governmental initiative in 
agricultural education and he emphasized the importance of amelior- 
ating -the social conditions of agricultural communities. John C. 
Medd, member of the Departmental Committee on Agricultural Edu 
eation.in England, discussed the education of rural children. Hi 
called attention to the fact that the rural school has not to educat 
for the life of the farm only, as many of their pupils migrate to th 
cities, and he thought that the village communities should suppl 
the towns with good material. He deplored the tendency to give th 
rural lad: less education than the city boy. The country boy, hi 
argued, whether destined to till the fields or not, needs just as thoroug 
an elementary education as the town boy, and is entitled to receiv 
what may enable him to rise to any position in life. 
Several papers were presented to this section on the needs an 
methods of child study in the home, the most significant of whic 
was that by Edmund Schopen, of Stoltzheim, Germany, on th 
importance of child psychology. The vast movement which ha 
swept over Europe and America, having for its object the bette: 
understanding of the mental development of children, he believed 
had not sufficiently influenced the home. He called attention i 
particular to the period of adolescence and the importance of parent: 
comprehending its mental and physical characteristics. A brief pape 
was presented on the problem of mental effort and mental fatigue 
by the writer of this report, and some of the hygienic aspects of speci 
significance to the home, such as sleep, food, and periods of growt! 
The third section of the congress considered problems touchin 
family education before school age. The question of the diet of th 
child was discussed by Doctors Henrotin and Leconte, of Brussels 
clothing by Miss Marie Parent, of Genval; sense training by

ermany. s 
The fourth section of the congress discussed family education 
uring the school age; and, after section two, it was the: largest 
ctional meeting of the congress. Miss Lempereur, principal of the 
yceée Fénelon at Lille, France, presented the opening paper on the 
uestion of school age. If conditions are normal and the health of 
e child good, she thought school instruction in certain studies— 
mnastics, manual training, reading, writing, drawing, and num- 
er—might begin at the age of 5 years; the more formal study of the 
aternal language at the age of 7; English, geography, and music at: 
; history and the elements of science at 9; German and arithemtic 
d hygiene at 10, and Latin at 15. Miss L. Baudeuf, of Tourcoing, 
rance, had a paper on the value of the principles of Froebel in the 
mily education of the child, and Mrs. E. L. Franklin, of England, 
dicated some lines of education that must be carried on in the home 
luring the school age. The home, she urged, must be held respon- 
ble for the physical well-being of the child; it must enforce habits of 
rsonal hygiene; cultivate a love for physical exercises and fresh 
r, provide frequent and thorough ablutions and simple and nutritious 
od. She thought, also, that the home should he held responsible 
r the training of the conscience of the child, and for moral lessons 
purity, truth, honesty, etc. 
Professor Merriam, of the School of Education of the University of 
issouri, had an important paper on the school’s contribution to the 
me. He pointed out that the home life of boys and girls should 
nsist largely in playing, in seeing and wondering, in doing with the 
nd what may be useful or ornamental, and in enjoying the printed 
related story. In the home is the immediate life of the pupil. 
ciency in immediate life is the best preparation for an effective 
ter life. The viewpoint of the child in his development is more 
ndamental than that of the adult. The child lives in the present; 
e adult looks into the future. The school must be productive, not 
rmal. The community may rightly demand of a school a broadly 
actical education. Thus the school serves as a means of advancing 
me life. Home life is primarily an end; it is only incidentally a 
leans of education for later life.

   The education of girls was the subject of twelve papers by as man: 
different speakers. Doctor Cordier, of Brussels, outlined an elabo 
rate course of semimedical instruction suitable for girls in secondar 
schools and essential for the duties of wifehood and motherhood 
including such topics as dangers of prematurely young marriages 
hygiene of pregnancy, conditions attending childbirth, the diet o 
babies, children’s diseases, and infant mortality. Miss C. Hamel, o 
Munich, Germany, believed that the education of girls should 
_ regarded chiefly from the viewpoints of hygiene, domestic economy, 
and ethics. Mrs. Van Besien, of Brussels, emphasized the impor. 
tance of courses of instruction in hygiene, maternity, child study, an 
dietetics. She pointed out the particular need of such courses in thi 
schools for girls in rural districts. The same topics were recom 
mended in the paper of Mrs. Matilde Garcia del Real, of Madrid; Mi 
R. Boreux, of Liege, recommended the dropping of many of th 
so-called literary and artistic studies in girls’ schools and substitutin, 
laboratory courses in physics, hygiene, and bacteriology. Miss AJ 
Pelseneer, of Ghent, advocated kindergarten training courses} 
clinical courses in nurseries, and courses in sexual hygiene and chil 
study. 
Seven papers presented the problem of nurses, governesses, an 
domestic servants in their relation to the home education of th 
child. Most of the speakers emphasized the need of greater trainin, 
for such posts, and particularly more extended courses in hygien 
and child psychology. Several papers were also devoted to th 
training of teachers. Mr. V. Mirgeut, of Brussels, thought that no: 
mal schools and training colleges should devote more time to th 
psychology of childhood and adolescence, questions touching mate’ 
nity and paternity, school hygiene, manual training, and soci 
science; and in normal schools for women, domestic science. 
The formation of the character of the young was the subject | 
papers by Mrs. Sophie Bryant, principal of the North London (En, 
land) Collegiate School, the Abbé Dejace, principal of St. Pa 
Institute, at Liege, and Dr. J. van Rees, of Amsterdam. Mrs. Bryan 
pointed out that a larger share of attention, insight, and skill rathe| 
than a larger portion of time was what was most needed in charact 
training, since this kind of educational work can not be measure 
in hours per week. Steady discipline is what counts most. A we 
ordered school life aids most in such virtues as courtesy, fair pla 
generosity, courage, etc. 
The value of manual training in the education of the child w 
presented by Inspector Marvin, of England; Mrs. Hierta Retzius, 
Sweden; Mr. C. Vry, of Holland, and Mr. J. B. Tensi, of Belgiu 
Mr. Marvin maintained that manual training should be an integr 
part of the education of every child. The expression of ideas i

manual activities is strong in childhood, and the child’s early con- 
tructive work contains in germ the adult’s artistic and mechanical 
chievement. Moreover, manual training forms the best basis for 
haracter training. Manual training gives keenness, resourcefulness, 
eadiness of mind and hand to turn old things to new uses, and 
abits of usefulness and economy. , 
Education in esthetics was considered from various view points 
yy seven speakers. Mr. J. H. Bradley, head master of the Beadles 
chool, England, argued that modern education was too exclusively 
tellectual. More attention should be devoted to hand work and 
rt in all their forms as means of intellectual, moral, and wsthetical 
raining. Four important agencies in the cultivation of the esthetic 
nse of the child are drawing, music, dancing, and dramatic art. 
istic appreciation can not be put into the child, only drawn out 
yy means of self-expression, and self-expression should at once be 
he end and the means of training the wsthetic sense. The Abbé 
isin, of Ferriers, Belgium, discussed scenery and country life as 
actors in the development of the esthetic sense. We must not. only 
ach the children to love the country, but to love the manual labor 
the country fields. Prof. Paul Gautier, of Stanislas College, Paris, 
resented some of the means of cultivating taste among young 
ople for things artistic. He spoke of the value of the study of 
rtistic buildings, statuary, and paintings through reproductions, 
upplemented by frequent visits to art museums. Mr. J. Lejeune, 
f Brussels, gave an account of esthetic courses in the elementary, 
condary, and normal schools of Belgium. Baron Driesen, of Russia, 
inted out the value of the theater as an agency in the development 
if the esthetic sense of the child. 
To the American student of education the small consideration 
iven to coeducation—one brief paper—came as something of a 
atter of surprise. But it will be recalled that outside of the tke 
ttled sections of a few countries in northern Europe, coeducation 
n scarcely be said to exist in Europe. The paper by Mr. Ernest 
ontou, of Aquitaine, pointed out the value of coeducation in an out- 
oor school. 
Forty-four papers were presented to section five, which was con- 
rned with family education after the school age, more than a dozen 
ing devoted to the matter of continuation schools for girls. Here, 
in the other sections, it was pointed out that elementary and sec- 3 
dary education, as at present administered, fail to give the kinds 
training needed for the functions of motherhood, child rearing, 
d housekeeping. Lady Riicker, of Kings College for Women, 
ngland, urged the addition of courses in biology, hygiene, sanitary 
‘ence, household economics, and child training as requirements for 
aduation in women’s colleges. She also urged the organization of

continuation classes for parents who already have children. Other 
speakers indicated what was being done in the different European 
countries in the matter of continuing the education of those who hav 
completed the compulsory school period. In this respect the indus. 
trial cities of western Europe seem to surpass the United States. 
The same section considefed the problem of social education 
The paper by Dr. Michael E. Sadler dealt with the problem of supple 
mentary education of young men from the social point of view. H 
thought that there was a tendency to think too exclusively of th 
utilitarian and technical side of supplementary education. Suc 
courses should inculcate the love of music, the love of drama, the lov 
of painting, and the other fine arts. Education of character and th 
training for the duties of the civic life are also of importance. Alber 
Mansbridge gave an account of the rise of university tutorial classe: 
in England. The purpose of this institution is (1) to arouse amon; 
the industrial classes greater interest in higher education and t 
direct their attention to the facilities already provided; (2) to ascer. 
tain the needs and wishes of workers in regard to education; and (3 
to provide, either in conjunction with local authorities or otherwise} 
facilities for studies of interest to workers which have hitherto bee 
overlooked. 
School excursions were discussed by Mr. P. Groeninckx, of Belgium 
and Professor Desfeuilles, of France. The international exchange o; 
pupils for the purpose of apprehending modern languages was pre 
sented from various view points by Mr. H. Mocquillon, of Paris, M 
Francois Kemény, of Budapest, and the Abbé Grand, of Cologn 
Local organizations in Europe carry on the necessary negotiations fo: 
the exchange of pupils. 
The sixth section of the congress was devoted to matters concer 
ing the education of abnormal children. Besides the introducto 
address by Doctor Decroly, of Brussels, on the classification of defectiv: 
children, the really important address of the section (and of the co: 
gress) was that made by Dr. Henry H. Goddard, of Vineland, N. J. 
. on heredity as a factor in mental defectiveness, In his own instit: 
tion some two hundred family trees have been partially worked ou 
Forty of them have been studied in detail, giving information as t 
the mental and physical condition of individuals in from two to fiv| 
generations. Charts were exhibited which showed much degenerac; 
running through the families; in several cases where both paren 
were alcoholic or tuberculous, all the children born to them wer 
feeble-minded. On the other hand, where one parent was tube 
culous and the other alcoholic, about half the children were health: 
His chart showed that when both parents were imbecile, most of t 
children were imbecile. The expert character of Doctor Goddard 
work was widely recognized.

INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON SCHOOL HYGIENE. 589 
The seventh section of.the congress dealt with various child-saving 
ugencies such as societies for the prevention of alcoholism and 
tuberculosis, children’s courts, care of abandoned children, etc.; 
he eighth section considered the various documents and other publi- 
ations bearing upon family education. In addition to the general 
nd sectional meetings of the congress there were several receptions 
nd visits to various educational institutions. 
Three invitations were presented by the United States for the 
ext meeting of the congress. Mrs. Frederic Schoff, on behalf of 
he Mothers’ Congress of America, presented an invitation from the 
ity of Washington; Mrs. J. Scott Anderson, in the name of several 
rganizations, the University of Pennsylvania, and the municipal 
uthorities, presented an invitation from the city of Philadelphia, 
nd Mrs. Fannie Fern Andrews presented an invitation from the 
ity of Boston. 
The executive committee decided to accept provisionally the 
nited States as the place of the next meeting, but the matter of 
ity and date, as well as the organization of the next congress, it left 
the following American committee: President, Commissioner 
Imer E. Brown, of the United States Bureau of Education; vice- 
resident, Prof. M. V. O’Shea, of the University of Wisconsin; 
cretary, the writer of this report. Other members of the com- 
ittee: Mrs. Frederic Schoff, of Philadelphia; Mrs. J. Scott Andersen, 
if Swarthmore; Mrs. Fannie Fern Andrews, of Boston, and Mrs. 
lien M. Henrotin, of Chicago. The next meeting will probably be 
eld during August, 1912 or 1913.

Sm: I have the honor to respectfully present a report as repre- 
ntative to the Third International Congress on School Hygiene, 
1d at Paris August 2 to 7 of the present year. 
The official opening of the congress took place on August 2 at the 
rbonne, Paris. It was a brilliant assembly of more than 1,600 
legates, representing nearly all the countries of the world. Pro- 
ssor Landouzy, dean of the faculty of medicine of Paris, represent- 
g the minister of public instruction, presided. 
Doctor Landouzy dwelt upon the aims of the congress and stated 
at there was no greater work than that of moral and physical

hygiene. Hygiene instruction begun at an early age he said meant 
the moral and the physical health of the individual and of the race. 
Dr. Albert Mathieu, the president of the congress, replied. 
In advocating open-air schools and their extension, Doctor Mathieu 
said that the time spent and the recreation taken in the open air were 
of the first importance to the health of the school children. Hel 
declared that the education of to-morrow, which will be the natural 
education, the physiologic education, would be how to improve the| 
intellectual education of the young, while at line same time diminish- 
ing the time devoted to study. He made a strong plea for the uni- 
formity of methods in the medical inspection of schools, and showe 
that the reorganization of the system of school hygiene would resul 
in more air in the schools, in the lungs, and in the programmes. 
Short addresses were made by the official representatives of th 
various governments. The representative of the National Bureau 
of Edueation of the United States conveyed to the congress the as. 
surance of widespread interest in this country in the purposes of th 
congress. The debt which America, as a young country, owes to th 
Old World, especially to France, in matters of general sciences, edu 
cation, and art, was duly acknowledged, and the gifts of genera 
anesthesia by etherization, of the amelioration of the ravages o 
puerperal fever, and the daring and brilliancy of American surgery 
were offered in part payment for the indebtedness. 
The conviction was expressed that educators and physicians i 
America were awake to the lessons of preventive medicine, and espe 
cially to the opportunities here for avoiding many of the condition’ 
now being fought by school hygiene in the older countries. 
The hope was expressed that the congress would meet in Americg 
in the near future in order that the methods in use here might receiv 
the advantage of review and correction from the leaders in hygien 
from the Old World. 
The sessions of the congress were held daily at the Grand Palai 
on August 3, 4, 5, and 6. Each session opened with a general meet 
ing, at which a report upon some particular topic, as “ Uniformity 
of method for physical examination in schools,” “ Sexual education, 
“ The training and appointment of the school doctor,” was presente 
by special reporters. Discussion continued from 9 to 10.30 o’cloc 
a. m., at which time adjournment tcok place for the work of th 
various sections. 
In the reports on the uniformity of methods for physical exami 
nations in schools, the French reporters (Doctors Méry and Dufestel 
advocated an anthropometric measurement of height, weight, an 
perimeter of the chest with a record of the respiratory amplitud 
and a somatic examination of the chest, of the glandular system, o} 
sight, of hearing, of the skeleton, of the nervous system, as well

of the scalp and hair. Weighing and measuring without clothing and 
shoes was advocated; testing hearing by the whispering voice rather 
than by watch tick was favored; and microscopic examination of the 
hair in cases of alopecia was thought essential. 
The English reporter (Doctor Kerr) divided the duties of the 
doctor into two groups: (1) For the prevention of infectious dis- 
eases; (2) for the improvement of general health and detection of 
defects requiring amelioration. 
The prevention of infectious diseases in Jarge towns and cities was 
considered futile if limited to efforts in schools alone. “The home 
nd the streets are more promising as a battle ground.” “ Daily 
isitation of schools by doctors with a vague preventive aim is 
aste of time and money.” “Inspection for improvement of the 
eneral health and the detection of defects must be both scientific 
nd practical. The accumulation of large masses of data is to 
e discouraged. A preliminary sorting of children on entrance is 
dvocated and after that the recording of abnormal children should 
e employed.” 
The report on sexual education was presented by Doctor Chotzen, 
f Breslau, and was the object of much heated controversy, that con- 
inued throughout the congress. The necessity of keeing the in- 
ruction in the hands of doctors chosen for that purpose was ad- 
itted generally, “because for the time being the doctors alone pos- 
ss the necessary knowledge for this class of teaching.” Parents and 
achers should be instructed before attempts are made to instruct 
e pupils. No method presented, by which instruction on sexual 
ygiene could be given in school to groups of pupils, was considered 
orthy of approval. Each method suggested had more elements of 
bjection than of approval. No other topic was so fully and 
rnestly discussed as this topic of the teaching of sexual hygiene. 
The third general report, namely, the training and the appoint- 
ent of the school doctor, was presented by Doctor Lesieur, Lyon, 
d Doctor Desquin, Antwerp. This report was by far the most 
portant of the congress. Every one realized that upon the proper 
lution of this problem rested the whole superstructure of school 
giene. Both reporters independently reached the same conclusion, 
mely, that it is not necessary that the school doctor should be a 
ecialist, but that he should be a man of science and of conscience. 
ompetitive examination, as instituted at Paris by the recent plan of 
ganization, was strongly urged. A general medical knowledge of a 
perior type, with a special knowledge of problems of infantile 
edicine, was considered a basis of good preparation. In addition 
these, special work in hygiene, in laboratories of bacteriology and 
emistry, and a knowledge of sociology and pedagogy with a capac- 
y for teaching both by means of familiar lectures were advocated as

essentials. The necessity for cooperation of doctor, teacher, and the 
home was accepted as a sine qua non of success. 
The programme upon which medical inspection of schools should 
rest should be without exaggeration of the medical point of view and 
should give full recognition to the school’s aim and purpose. The 
programme was stated as follows: 
    
         
   
     
         
     
    
   
   
       
   
     
    
   The school, considered, often with reason, to be the source of diseases and 
divers deformities, ought to serve in preserving the children from those diseases 
and in repairing the deformities from which they are suffering; to fight against 
the predisposition which heredity or bad conditions in which they live have 
placed them; to strengthen their constitutions; in a word to make them suit- 
able, intellectually and physically, in the struggle for life. 
The general work of the congress was divided into eleven sections. 
In each section one or two reporters had been selected to report at 
the opening of the session upon some particular subject. These re- 
ports formed a volume of nearly 500 pages. In addition to these 
special reports, special communications were admitted at each session 
of each section. These with the discussions are to be published in 
book. form. 
Section 1 was devoted to educational buildings and furnishings. 
Shower baths were recommended as a part of necessary school equip- 
ment, In Norway 27 per cent of the towns have baths in the schools, 
Some are free, others charge a small price:for towels. Swimmin; 
baths do not exist in any of their schools, ‘although rescuing the 
shipwrecked and swimming lessons are given. Children recently a 
baths are not permitted to go out for recreation on account of dange 
of catching cold. Objections raised by parents are: Fear of catchin; 
vermin in the dressing rooms, the confinement of children in room 
when the air is vitiated by the emanations of linen and dampness. 
and the direct weakening of power for work in lessons following th 
bath. : 
Section 2 was devoted to the hygiene of residential schools. Th 
plan of small dormitories (10 or 12 beds) was favored and the rural 
rather than the urban, style of construction advocated. The amateu 
theatricals and evening parties were condemned as potent factors i 
causing or aggravating sexual bad habits. 
To warn the boarders of the danger resulting from onanism is a two-edgei 
weapon which slips from the doctor’s hands, especially when used prophy 
Jactically. It is only in the case where the fault will have been detected tha 
it would be profitable for the guilty to know the dangers to which they ar 
exposed. The explanation can be given by the doctor, the mother, or th 
teacher (Gozdzicki, Sarsovie). 
Section 3 considered medical inspection of schools and individua’ 
health records. Practical Measures for active application. This sec 
tion dwelt strongly upon the necessity of cordial relations of docto

      acher, home, and the family physician. The differing aspects of 
edical inspection in rural and in the urban schools were pointed out 
well prepared papers. Three examinations during the child’s 
hool life were proposed: (1) On admission, as a filter; (2) at about 
e eighth year of age, a compulsory examination, especially of the 
ind and special senses; (3) before leaving, preferably in the thir- 
enth year of age. - 
Reports were presented from France, Italy, Germany, and Eng- 
nd, showing the methods employed in each country. The term 
chool doctor,” or “school physician,” expresses more accurately the 
ties outlined than the term “medical inspector,” as understood in 
merica. All reports emphasized the necessity of avoiding inter- 
rence with the family physician in the care or treatment of school 
ildren. The value of school nurses in following up the children 
spected was highly indorsed. School clinics had their advocates 
d their opponents. A most comprehensive and special report on 
e organization of the medical inspectors of schools in France was 
esented by Dr. M. L. Guibert. 
Physical training was the subject considered in section 4. “ Play- 
ounds are as indispensable for pupils as air and light. These 
aces ought to be situated in proximity to schools. It is the abso- 
e duty of authorities who have not dealt with the question of 
ygrounds to take the subject into consideration” (Converset). 
e term “ physical education” was substituted for the term “ gym- 
stics ” “ because it rouses an idea of conscious and natural exercise, 
ays adapted to a useful aim and not to a particular system of 
vements.” (Demeny). Physical education should have four quali- 
s—health or strength; dexterity and agility; bodily beauty and 
tiative; courage, daring, and the persevering will. Each of these 
acquired by particular exercises, and physical education is the 
rmony of the various and different movements which give these 
lalities physical perfection. Automatic exercises were condemned 
being unintelligent, and simple exercises demanding from the 
pil a personal effort which develops his will and initiative were 
ocated. The exercises should be in accordance with age and 
acity. In a child the avoidance of violent exercise or overexertion 
ecessary on account of the overpowering influence of the action of 
wth. Here games in the open air, liberty, and hygiene are the 
per course. The relationship of proper attitudes in manual work 
in sloyd was the subject of much discussion. The use of the 
ht and left hands alternately in all possible forms of work was 
vocated. s 
ection 5 dealt with the prevention of contagious diseases in school 
with illnesses attributable to school attendance. Besides reports

on parasitic diseases of skin and on the prevention of malaria amon; 
school children, two special reports were presented on the superintend 
ence of infected children when out of school and the conditions o 
their readmission to school. The French reporter (Doctor Merklen 
advocated isolation periods as follows: Measles, eight days after com 
mencement of eruption; scarlet fever, during peeling, minimum, fort: 
days; smallpox, fifteen days after recovery; chicken pox, during th 
drying, minimum, fifteen days; rubeola, four or five days after en 
of the eruption; mumps, twenty-five days after commencement; dip 
theria, forty to sixty days; whooping cough, during stage of fits o| 
coughing; vermin, after disappearance of nits. Readmission on ce! 
tificate of physician only. Those exposed are to be excluded as fo! 
lows: Measles, twenty days; scarlet fever, six weeks; smallpox, fi 
teen days; rubeola, twenty-five days; diphtheria, while harborin 
germ; whooping cough, eight days. The American reporter (D 
Thomas F. Harrington) showed that the greatest danger lies in t 
mild or unrecognized cases of infectious diseases; that the prese 
state of our knowledge points to the sores, or discharge of lips, mout 
nose, ear, or throat as the probable source of contagion in scarlet fev 
rather than the peeling or desquamation. The decline in morbidity 
school diseases in summer is seasonal and not due to school closur| 
as statistics for twenty years in Boston show that the decline in t 
wave of morbidity began three weeks before the opening of the schoo| 
in the fall term. School closure not necessary unless there is a roo! 
outbreak of diphtheria or scarlet fever. Infection in measles occu 
before the rash, hence all not immune are probably infected upon t 
detection of the first’ case. 
The section voted to adopt the resolution offered by Doctor Ha 
rington that special quarantine nurses were the most effective mea 
of controlling in the home cases that would not accept hospital is 
lation, and secondly, that the high mortality and morbidity fro} 
measles and whooping cough were unnecessary and were due to crir 
inal ignorance on the part of parents. These diseases are mo 
fatal than scarlet fever or smallpox. 
The section thought prophylactive doses of antitoxin more eff 
tive in controlling diphtheria in schools than the exclusion 
“ carriers.” 
The idea was emphasized that parasitic diseases of the skin al 
all avoidable, and that the liberal use of soap and water is sufficie 
to accomplish that end. X-ray treatment advocated for favus. I] 
struction by school nurses was acknowledged to be a most effecti 
method of education in the homes in combating infection, 
Open-air schools, vacation colonies, and out-of-school hygie 
were the subjects of section 6. The distinction observed in Ameri 
between open-air “day schools” and the sanatoria was emphasiz

‘he former rooms or schools are for the weak, anemic, glandular 
nildren, and are preventive; the latter form of school—the sana- 
orium—is for those exhibiting active signs of tuberculosis. In the 
yon open-air school the midday rest is much shorter than in the 
reign schools, because the pretubercular do not require so much 
sst as the tuberculous. The formula “ Double rations of air, double 
ations of food, half rations of work” should be adopted for all 
pen-air instruction. Definite programmes for open-air schools were 
resented. 
In section 7 the teaching staff, their hygiene, their relations with 
he homes and with the school doctor were given special attention. 
he physical examination of all candidates for the teaching profes- 
on was urged and special examination for signs of tubercular dis- 
se, aortic regurgitation, mitral disease with heart failure, Graves’s 
isease (even in its slightest form), marked neurasthenia, chronic 
right’s disease, and diabetes mellitus, any one of which should reject 
e applicant. “Graves’s disease is six times more common among 
males than among males and more common among female teachers — 
an in other individuals” (Williamson). School nurses and the use 
schoolrooms by parents were argued as effective agencies in accom- 
ishing happy relationship between masters and parents. “ Medical 
pectors and hygienists who are interested in the schools ought 
ways to remember that ‘ once for all school is not a sanatorium; it is 
x the pupils as for the masters a craft, a profession, and each craft, 
en the easiest, admits in itself some dangers.’ In addition, school- 
asters must not forget that the school réle does not exclusively con- 
t in accumulating as much knowledge as possible in the pupils’ 
‘ains, but also in making them clever and healthy men ”. (Altschul). 
Section 8 dealt with the teaching of hygiene to teachers, scholars, 
d parents. The importance and the necessity of the teaching of 
fant rearing to mistress and pupils were particularly urged. Also 
e teaching of temperance in schools. “The master can exercise 
s trust only if he himself knows general hygiene, and more espe- 
liy school hygiene. His intelligence and devotion can not supply 
je place of the knowledge of this delicate science, of which he ought 
have a sufficient notion if he desires to have the right of teaching 
blicly ” (Hallé). 
Teaching methods and syllabuses in relation to school hygiene was 
heading for section 9. Definite time-tables were presented for 
ildren of different school ages. These tables were based upon 
logy, and had in view the recognized fact that young organism, 
ile having a very active cellular activity, soon exhausts itself. 
ence the necessity for frequent rest and change. 
he subject of inattention was particularly interesting. The 
ses of inattention given were: (1) Parents’ influence; indifferent

to instruction or having need of their children for domestic. work: 
the parents do not impose on them a regular attendance; sometimes 
they give them a mentality incompatible with fitness for school tasks 
(2) Indiscipline, which prevails especially in secondary instruction: 
also sometimes in a too severe restraint. (8) Insufficiency of acquired 
knowledge, lack of homogeneity, apathy of character, dull witted. 
ness, exclusive taste for out-of-school tasks; in a word, intellectua 
weakness. (4) Various physiological causes, e. g., muscular weak. 
ness, sensorial infirmities, inequality or insufficiency of age, lymphat. 
ism, neuropathic heredity, imperfect nourishment, season, disposi 
tion, ete. 
Causes of inattention associated with plans and methods of in: 
struction are: (1) The disproportion between some subjects of in. 
struction and the pupils’ age; the waste of time. (2) Lack o 
adaptation of methods, whether intuitive or dialectic, according t 
the personality of the master or the pupil. (3) With the masters 
_lack of psychology, which makes them confuse amusement and inter 
est and does not permit them to adapt their process to the pupil 
temperaments. The remedies suggested were: All tonics of th 
mind and body, especially everything that improves and regulate} 
the principal physiological functions; more regularity in school a 
tendance and collaboration with the paveute: methods better adapte 
to pupil’s age; programme less full and nearer to life; more conce! 
tration in the use of time; a discipline, kind but severe; a bette 
arrangement of material and premises; and, finally, the cultivatior 
by masters of the physiological sense and of intellectual’ sympath: 
The evil effects on attention resulting from imperfect sanitary cond 
tions of the schools, results which are both psychical and physica’ 
were shown. 
Another subject of equal importance considered in this section w 
the advantages and the disadvantages of distributing or concentra 
ing lessons in planning the time-tables. Schreg, of Berne, maintaine 
that too many subjects are taught simultaneously; that there is 
unity in the minds of the pupils; and that we aim too exclusively 
the training of the memory. Concentration was favored. “ If onl] 
we succeed in finding an intimate link between the subjects of a ce! 
tain group, the inadequacy of our present system can be much mit 
gated.” 
The subjects were grouped into two classes—the one made up 
languages and the other of mathematics and science; the latt 
subjects to be grouped around one common center—the action of t 
hand. Lévy-Wogue contended that there was no class type, bi 
pupils only. That what distinguishes pupils from each other a 
difference of attention, will, and education. He showed that t 
sensation of fatigue is not measured by the duration of the classi

ut by the nature of the subject; and that every pedagogical problem 
omes back to the art of keeping the attention. Short lessons and 
arying exercises were offered as remedies. 
The abnormal child was the subject of general discussion in sec- 
ion 10. The distinction between the backward child and the men- 
lly defective was plainly set forth. The advantage of manual 
ork in the time-table was emphasized and the necessity for follow- 
g the natural sentiments of the child in the order of development, 
mely, curiosity and attention. 
Section 11 was divided into subsections on the hygiene of the eye, 
the ear, of the mouth and teeth. Le Prince advocated as a treat- 
ent in short-sighted pupils upright writing for the young children, 
nd later slant writing. The manner of holding of the pen by the 
ild has much importance. Dufour corroborated Cohn’s rules, viz: 
) In all schools the number of short-sighted pupils increases from 
lass to class. (2) The average degree of short-sightedness increases 
om class to class. (3) The number of short-sighted pupils in- 
eases with the increase of school demands. 
Drs. Gellé fils, of Paris, and Hennebert, of Brussels, presented a: 
int report on how to measure the hearing power of school children. 
ey concluded that all who can not hear a whispered voice at two 
eters can not profit by stay in the class. Schoolrooms from 8 to 
meters long.for 30 pupils were advocated as best for teacher’s voice 
d pupils’ ears. Dental clinics and popular lectures were favored 
ir combating the neglect of oral hygiene. 
Each afternoon, demonstrations of physical exercises, games, 
lays, and folk dances were given by groups of pupils from schools 
different nations. Each group demonstrated the strength and the 
akness of each type of exercise. 
The excursions and social entertainments arranged by the local 
mittees were all well planned and offered to the visitors and 
legates very pleasant opportunities for instruction and enter- 
nment. 
The concluding meeting of the congress was held at the “ Sor- 
Inne” Saturday, August 6. M. Henry Chéron, secretary of the 
artment of marine, presided. Addresses were made by M. Ché- 
and by Doctor Mathieu, president of the congress. Short ad- 
lesses were offered by Sir Lauder Brunton, representing England, 
id Dr. Thomas F. Harrington for the United States. The city 
Buffalo, United States of America, extended an invitation to the 
gress to meet in that city in 1913. The representation from 
ffalo agreed that the organization and planning of the scientific, 
icational, and social parts of the congress should be in the hands 
a national committee to be elected later under the auspices of the 
erican School Hygiene Association. With this assurance, Doc-

       Boston, September 7, 1910, 
To the Comaiussioner or Epucation, 
Washington, D. C. 
Sir: I have the honor to respectfully present the report of th 
Third International Congress on the Physical Education of th 
Young, held at Brussels. August 10 to 13 of the present year. 
The United States was represented by Drs. H. M. Bracken, Arth 
T. Cabot, R. Tait McKenzie, and Thomas F. Harrington. T 
congress opened August 10 at the Grande Salle des Fates of t! 
Brussels Exposition. Dr. Victor Desquin was president of th 
congress. In his opening address Doctor Desquin pointed out. t! 
extreme importance of physical education and the widespread re 
ognition of this fact to-day. “L’élan est donné déclare t-il, il 
sarrétera pas.” 
M. A. Fosséprez, the secretary-general of the congress, presented 
report in which he declared that physical education is a question 
progress, of patriotism, and of humanitarianism; that it makes ea 
child a strong unit in the collective humanity; that it is not possib! 
to separate the physical education from general education, for all tl] 
biologic phenomena, which are intellectual, moral, or physical, a 
intimately united. He contended for shorter lessons in schools 
order that the pupils might have more time for physical exercises 
the open air. Following this report the delegates representing H 
land, Austria, Russia, Mexico, Argentine, United States (Doct 
McKenzie), Portugal, and France presented the greetings of the 
respective Governments. 
The work of the congress was divided into two general divisions, o: 
devoted to the theory of physical education, the other to the meth 
and application. A series of questions had been prepared and diff 
ent authorities asked to prepare a report on each. Daily sessions we| 
held on August 11, 12, and 13.

3 CONGRESS ON PHYSICAL EDUCATION. 599 
At the opening session the question of preparation of the young 
for military life was discussed, and out of the discussion the follow- 
ing resolutions were adopted: (1) All grouping recalling the school 
battalion should be banished from the school. (2) The instruction 
given in the school and in the societies should not encroach upon the 
professional military domain. (3) The federation and sporting soci- 
eties keep their autonomy, and in exchange for certain advantages 
they offer to the State the result of their work. (4) The gymnastics 
applied to the school ought to be adequate to the aptitude and to the 
nature of the child, and directed by educators possessing pedagogical 
knowledge. 
At the second session the question of games, plays, and sports was 
presented. In this report and discussion the difference between organ- 
ized games and free play was pointed out, and the danger of prolonged 
sports, such as football for half an hour, in producing hypertrophy 
lof the heart, was emphasized. There was much difference of opinion 
ion the value and the advantages of football as a school sport, espe- 
ially for boys under the age of 18 years. Handball was favored in 
reference to football. All matches, contests, and competition in 
sports were condemned. Athletics for sport’s sake alone were advo- 
sated. Here, as in the previous report on preparation for military 
ife, the problem did not have direct bearing upon the conditions in 
he United States, many of the games and sports discussed, especially 
football, being different from the American school games. 
M. Sluys maintained that the aim of play is the recreation, the 
evelopment of sociability; that contests and matches destroyed 
hese; that one plays only for the glory. He expressed himself 
strongly against the publicity given to the “ridiculous and murder- 
us” sporting events. 
The congress advocated the adoption of plays and sports better 
dapted to the physiologic development of the pupils, and recom- 
ended a greater preparation of teachers of physical education in 
oint of view of plays and sports. After the age of 18 years inter- 
cholastic matches and the giving of prizes of very small value were 
bermitted. 
The reports on questions of general methods and on the applica- 
ion of gymnastics were very important and brought out some heated 
ontroversies. The discussion at times partook much of the form of 
ersonalities between the advocates of rival schools. After much 
eated discussion it was voted to adopt the conclusion that (1) peda- 
ogic gymnastics ought to comprehend the attitude, the movements, 
Ihe exercises of which the scientific and experimental studies have 
erified the physiologic éffects as capable of favoring the aim of 
hysical and general education. (2) There is cause for forming 
boratories where the physiologic effect of the different gymnastics

should be studied. The results of the labors should be published in a 
bulletin. The labors should be confined to physiologists possessing 
the technique of special instructors and accustomed to the practice of 
gymnastic exercises. 
The congress took a decided stand in favor of little or no formal 
gymnastics in the kindergarten and lower primary grades. At that 
age the education of the aptitude by means of play with playthings, 
marches with songs, allegorical plays, and dances were favored. In. 
the upper primary classes, the corrective and analytic gymnastics be- 
come most important. “In the first two years of the grammar school 
and in the classes below those of the atheneum, one should give equal 
attention to each of the three aims—hygiene, esthetic, economic, but 
accentuating somewhat corrective gymnastics. He should accustom 
himself to notice, at that age, in the pupils’ bones, an evolution of the 
organism which it is necessary to watch closely if one wishes to avoid 
the deformities” (Denéve). In the last year of the grammar school 
and in the high school, the exercises of application take a prominent 
place. Games and sports should be recommended to young men. 
In the discussion of the application of gymnastics, the following} 
resolutions prevailed: (1) That pedagogic gymnastics should be th 
basis of the application of gymnastics. (2) The applications unde 
the form of play, of swimming, of dances, of rhythm should appertai 
to programmes of all degrees of instruction and ought to be in har; 
mony with the fundamental principles of pedagogic gymnastics 
(8) The professional application of gymnastics, such as the specia 
exercises of military gymnastics, of those of firemen, of marines, ete 
do not form a part of the programme of schools. (4) The schoo 
gymnastics should not go to the application, but should tend toward it. 
On question No. 6, “ Comparative value of the theoretic deduc 
tion and the scientific experimentation in the fixation of the base: 
of the method,” M. G. Demény presented the results of his researches 
This report was construed as an attack upon present methods o: 
gymnastics, especially the Swedish school. Two sessions were con 
sumed in the discussion, which became very personal at times 
Demény contended for movements which, in order to obtain the maxi 
mum of useful effect, must be natural and have a practical aim. H 
deprecated the artificial movements and advocated movements mor 
complete, more varied, more conformable to those connected with th 
ordinary occupations. He pointed out especially the abuse of th 
movements of respiration so often associated with an unnecessar 
expenditure of force preceding the effort. 
At the session on August 12 the following resolutions, which ha 
been adopted at the International Congress on School Hygiene ai 
Paris, the week previously, were adopted: (1) It is desirable tha 
the physical education of all the boys and of all the girls in all school;

public and private, shall be obligatory. (2) It would be well that in 
all the examinations the major points should be reserved for those 
who prove that they have followed a good course in physical edu- 
ation. 
Many of the other questions presented at the congress were similar 
o those discussed at the Paris Congress on School Hygiene, i. e., med- 
eal examination of boarding schools; hygiene of games, plays, and 
ports; baths, shower baths, and swimming; difference between rural 
nd urban organization of gymnastics; school excursions; plan of 
‘vmnastic lessons, ete. 
Each day practical demonstrations were given by classes from the 
yarious schools of Brussels and vicinity. The congress concluded 
ith a féte of gymnastics comprising about 8,000 gymnasts. This 
emonstration formed a part of the Brussels general exhibition in 
ession during the Congress on Physical Education. 
The delegates representing the United States desire to express their 
igh appreciation of Mr, Bryan, the United States minister at Brus- 
els, for his kind assistance in their mission and to thank him for his 
omelike hospitality and entertainment during their stay at Brussels. 
This report is respectfully submitted on behalf of the delegates, 
rs. H. M. Bracken, R. T. McKenzie, and Thomas F. Harrington, 
vho met formally at Brussels and authorized its presentation by the 
ndersigned.

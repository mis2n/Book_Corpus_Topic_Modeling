  FOREWORD 
HIS is a new sort of book, and unique. That 
is why I look upon the permission to write 
a brief preface for it as a rare privilege. Writings 
on children are frequent. When, in 1875, I 
contributed, for Karl Gerhardt’s immense Hand- 
' buch, my Hygiene of the Child, I quoted seven 
hundred treatises or pamphlets on that subject. 
There are now at least seven thousand of the kind, 
and the number of text-books on the diseases 
of children and infants do no longer lead a pardon- 
able, rarely a laudable, existence. A few mono- 
graphs on special subjects, or modern publications, 
as Erich Wulffen’s The Child: His Nature and 
Degeneration (Berlin, 1913), or the two large 
anthropological volumes by H. Ploss, The Child 
in the Customs and Morals of Nations (third edi- 
tion by B. Renz, 1911), are praiseworthy examples 
of useful books. But while these are instructive 
they do not rouse historical interest. 
Indeed, the history of the child has been grossly 
neglected. The epoch-making works of Rosen- 
stein, Charles West, Rilliet and Barthez, and 
Karl Gerhardt contain no history. The work of 
Puschmann (Neuberger and Pagel) fills twenty 
pages with the history of the child in a text of

three thousand pages relating to the history of 
medicine. Altogether our country has been dis- 
respectful to its best possessions, viz., the children. 
There was until a few decades ago not even a 
professional teaching of the children’s diseases 
in our medical schools. A regular chair was 
established in 1860 (New York Medical College), 
—it lasted for a few years only. The second was 
in 1898 (Harvard). There were few child’s 
hospitals or wards in hospitals until a few years 
ago, even in the largest cities. Society, law, 
humanitarianism did not mind children. It is 
only a few months that an official publication in our 
democratic country carried the title; ‘‘Is There a 
Need of a Child Labour Law?”’ and our civilization 
was humbled by medical discussion of the ad- 
visability of killing the deformed or unpromising 
newborn. It seems to take a long time before 
this republic of ours begins to work out of the ruts 
of semi-barbarism. And now, at last, there is a 
book to supply our wants. 
Laymen have advanced ahead of the medical 
profession. Christ and the Stoics, the clergy and 
the public opinion of the Crusades and the Christ- 
ian sentiments of the Medieval Church, aye, the 
great slaughterer and revolutionary reformer, 
Napoleon, have called the children under their 
protection and benefactions. 
A vast amount of study relating to primary 
populaces and nations in gradual development 
was required to learn the history of the child.

Foreword Vv 
Without the history of the child there cannot be 
a scientific knowledge of the thousands of years of 
child life. Nobody has given it until the author 
of this book afforded us the wealth of his vast 
studies. This book furnishes what no other 
work presents to us. I know of none which 
acquaints us with the position of the child in his 
social, political, and humanitarian existence in all 
nations and in all eras. Adults and adult life 
have long been served by the endeavours of 
historians, philosophers, and psychologists. We 
do not believe in completeness of our knowledge 
unless all that have been perfected. Medical men 
do not believe in possessing a scientific grasp of 
any of their subjects without an embryological bas- 
is. Statesmen, aye, even politicians, of the better 
class, insist upon an ample knowledge of the 
history of their countries, their institutions, and 
their laws. That is how the last years of our 
medical and professional life in this country have 
developed amongst us physicians the taste for 
history and such books as Fielding Garrison has 
been able to prepare for us within the last year. 
When I said the book before us was unique, I 
meant to say that it is a special monograph of the 
life through thousands of years of slow physical, 
domestic; economic, social existence of the child. 
No historian, no medical practitioner or teacher, 
surely no existing pediatrist will be without it.

PREFACE 
the author from the onerous task, ofttimes 
a graceless one, of writing extended prefa- 
tory remarks. It was in the course of some re- 
searches into the origin of the Child Protection 
movement in this country that I discovered how 
little attention had been paid to the historical 
aspect of this important question. This book 
represents really a process of elimination, behind 
which were many fascinating byways, alluring 
blind alleys, and seeming countless beckoning 
theories. Toward the last, for a person with 
human instinct writing on a humane subject, it 
was hard not to tilt. In the main, however, the 
author believes that he has hewed to the line. 
The author is indebted for many courtesies to 
the officials of the New York Public Library, like- 
wise to the Congressional Library at Washington, 
the British Museum at London, and the Biblio- 
théque Nationale at Paris. His thanks are due 
also to Dr. C. C. Williamson, formerly Chief of 
the Economics Division of the New York Public 
Library, who took a deep and serious interest in 
the work; to Professor Richard Gottheil of Colum-

Gabriel Schlesinger, for assistance in reading the 
proofs; and, above all, to Mr. Robert E. MacAlar-

criticism and deep personal interest the author 
owes more than can be here set down.

concept of the first family that crossed the 
vague and age-consuming frontier between 
animality and humanity, it would be safe to say 
that this primitive and almost animal mind would 
reach for an approximation, on the part of the 
male, to the maternal affection. 
In the gathering of food and the making of 
protective war, many animals are the rivals in 
instinct and intelligence of primitive man. Con- 
tinued development in that regard might have 
produced a race of men ‘“‘formidable among ani- 
mals through sheer force of sharp-wittedness,” 
but not homo sapiens. In the passage from ani- 
mality to humanity, there was not only mental 
I [' it were possible to postulate the first definite

evolution, but moral, and the developing mind 
would naturally exercise itself for days and years, 
and perhaps for long periods around that one 
emotion—the love of the female for its young— 
an emotion he was incapable of understanding, 
but the outward manifestations of which he would 
be bound to imitate. 
Whether man was led to an understanding of 
the maternal affections by the ‘‘sensuous aspects 
of the newly-born progeny” appealing to man 
himself,’ or through pity and sympathy, as Spen- 
cer suggests, or still more through imitation of the 
maternal delight, he undoubtedly would be led toa 
higher mental plane as he slowly came to under- 
stand that the maternal affection was not self- 
gratifying in the sense that marked the entire 
gamut of his own emotions up to that time. y 
_ Even in recent times tribes have been found §0 
low in the social scale that coition and child-birth 
have been assumed to have no relation, the latter 
phenomenon being explained by ascribing to cer- 
tain trees the power to make women fructile) 
In a society as low in mentality as this, it would 
be easy to conceive that the woman’s unselfish- 
ness—her lack of the self-gratifying impulse— 
in protecting, nursing, and rearing a burden super- 
imposed on her with no pleasurable antecedents, 
would be even more amazing than it would be to 
the male living in a state sufficiently advanced to 
understand the reproductive function. 
t Alex. Bain, The Emotions and the Will.
-P-A-G-E-27
     Sociological Leap 3 
In either state of society, there then begins in 
the human consciousness a disturbance ‘“‘which 
is significant of something having another value 
than that of mere pleasure, and which is pregnant 
with the promise of another than the merely 
sensuous or merely intellectual life.””* The words 
quoted are Prof. Ladd’s, discussing the philosophy 
of conduct of civilized man—but here, even in 
the primitive man, the rule applies—the moral 
idea is born, legitimately enough, out of the al- 
truistic maternal affection. 
Not infrequently one comes across such expres- 
sions as ‘‘when man became civilized,” starting 
always the baffling inquiry—what civilized man? 
The mystery of life, as Bergson suggests, may be 
its solution, for in the acquired tendency of look- 
ing on the world as containing one emotion at 
least that was not purely self-gratifying, man was 
preparing himself for the virtues that followed in 
the wake of his own first altruistic concept. The 
loyalty without which there could be no sociality 
has, on the one hand, a reasoned basis—the selfish 
and protecting one that may also explain the gre-— 
gariousness of animals—but it differs from grega- 
riousness by subordinating to the good of another 
one’s own pleasure, just as the mother subordi- 
nates her wishes to the pleasure and good of the 
infant. Itis, in fact, the developed emotion that 
the male acquires through imitation and sympathy 
from the female, for, ‘‘when a tendency splits up 
«George Trumbull Ladd, Philosophy of Conduct,
-P-A-G-E-28
  4 History of the Child 
in the course of its development, each of the special 
tendencies which thus arise, tries to preserve and 
develop everything in the primitive tendency that 
is not incompatible with the work for which it is 
specialized.’’* 
Back of this sociological ‘“‘leap’’ is Nature’s 
long preparation. , ‘‘The stability of animal mar- 
riage,’’ says Wundt,? ‘‘seems in general to be 
proportional to affection for the young,” and yet 
the primitive instincts are sometimes so powerful 
that even among those animals in whom the 
maternal instinct is strongly developed, they will, 
even after facing great danger for their young, 
desert them when the time comes to migrate. 
This Darwin says is true of swallows, house mar- 
_tins, and swifts. But even in the lowest animals the ‘‘chief 
source of altrusim”’ is the family group as it re- 
volves round the care of the young, while with 
the increase in the representative capacity that 
differentiates man from the brute, and the pro- 
longation of the period of human infancy, there 
is born real altruism, the germ of morality, through 
the ‘‘knitting together of permanent relations 
between mother and infant, and the approxima- 
tion toward steady relations on the part of the 
male parent.”

        First Conceptions of Humanity 5 
“How then does it happen that an instinct that 
has been productive of so much for humanity, an 
instinct that has given birth to most of those vir- 
tues that mark civilized from savage man,‘ served 
apparently so little as a safeguard for the offspring 
that generated the moral evolution? Studying 
the cross currents and the ever-present struggle 
for existence of the various nations that worked 
out of barbarism to civilization, we see that after 
all it is by and through the very virtues, ten- 
derness, sympathy, and humanity, that were first 
aroused by the helpless offspring, that the infant 
comes in turn to be protected, though the path is 
frequently a tortuous one. 
The society that was able to exist in primitive 
times was always the one that sacrificed the indi- 
vidual,? and the infant was naturally low in the 
scale of value. That very sacrifice of the weakest, 
stratified into a national characteristic, produced 
in the greatest civilization of ancient times, a 
narrow and egoistical morality, with little concep- 
tion of what we call humanity. ‘‘No Greek ever

of her thoughts and her deeds. Thus the strength of her erotic 
instincts diminished. The tenderness awakened in her by her 
children also benefited the father. Out of this tenderness—as 
also out of the admiration for the manly qualities which the father 
developed in the defence of herself and her children—gradu- 
ally arose the erotic feeling directed to this man alone. Thus 
love began.”’ m

attained the sublimity of such a point of view,” 
says George Henry Lewes.* 
In this, the ‘‘century of the child,” there is a 
great conception of humanity, and even of child- 
ren’s rights. Little attempt, however, has been 
made to trace in consecutive and co-ordinate 
fashion the development among races and nations 
of the progress of the human race in its attitude 
toward children. We who are so much interested 
in the betterment of the race and who are so much 
moved by humanitarian considerations that almost 
the first consideration of the state is to provide 
for the children, have reached this point of view 
only after a long struggle against blind ignorance 
and reckless selfishness. 
The fact that less than fifty years have passed 
since we began a definite policy concerning the 
tights of children shows how rapidly the human 
tace moves. The race may be, let us say, some- 
thing like 240,000 years old; of that time civilized 
man—accepting the most generous figures on 
Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilization—has 
existed only 10,000 years, or stv of the life of 
the human species. 
( Humanized man has existed not more than a 
few hundred years, and it is within only fifty 
years that the race has been concerned with the 
protection of the child. How deeply ingrained 
are the habits of barbarity and darkness, may 
be seen from the fact that cannibalism broke

The Century of the Child 7, 
out in Japan not more than a hundred years 
ago. ) 
Unquestionably, this is the century of the child. 
Undoubtedly, more serious thought is being given 
in the present generation to the subject than has 
ever been given before in the entire history of the 
world. More has been written about the child in 
the last fifty years than had been written in the 
world in all civilized times up to the beginning of 
this half-century. In order to appreciate this 
statement one must remember that (the best 
friends of the child—Jesus, the Jewish Prophets, 
and Mohammed—lived centuries before the human 
theories that they preached had really a living 
existence. 
In this connection, it is germane to state that the 
theory that philosophy and religion go hand in 
hand with humanity, is shattered by the fact that 
Plato, Aristotle, Confucius, and Gautama affected, 
apparently, not a single jot, the ancient attitude of 
insufferance toward the undesired children. 
There has ever been, on the question of his 
children, a struggle between man and nature. 
Endowed with the possibilities of a large offspring 
man has fought the burdens that nature has thrust 
upon him. (On first view, it seems that parental 
affection never develops to great degree unless the 
economic conditions are favourable;)yet the vari- 
ous artifices and ‘“‘laws”’ used by tribes to get rid 
of children would show that parental affection 
kept struggling with the inclinations of men. In   
 
-P-A-G-E-32

other words; if we find, as we do, female children 
sacrificed in one place because they are useless, 
and all first-born children sacrificed in another 
place because the gods must be propitiated, it is 
evident that parental affection (as represented by 
the women) was strong enough to force the male 
sovereigns to invent plausible excuses and taboos 
in order to have the women give up their offspring. 
Considering all that is being done, said, and 
written on the subject of the child and the rela- 
tion of the state and citizen toward the child, it 
would seem safe to assume that there would be 
some interest in the attitude of our predecessors 
toward children. 
From the regulation of Romulus, as set forth by 
Dionysius Halicarnassus, to the story of Mary 
Ellen, as set forth by a settlement worker on the 
East Side of New York City, is a far cry, but the 
progress from the first to the second is steady. 
(The Roman General, Agathocles, who made as a 
part of the terms of peace with the Carthaginians 
an agreement on the part of that branch of the 
Semitic race that they would cease to sacrifice 
children, was a legitimate sociological progenitor 
of the representative of the arm of the law that 
stops a drunken father from beating his child and 
creates a Children’s Court where the child gets 
gentleness with justice, not contamination and 
corruption.

jurist ought to be a historian,” says Ortolan, and

Children in Progress 9 
the historian of child progress feels not only the 
truth of that statement but the added necessity 
of meeting the various economic theories that 
have dealt with the care of the child, from those 
of Lycurgus to the latter-day essay of Malthus. 
The law of primogeniture and the varying laws 
of inheritance have occasionally led to the study 
of children as children, but generally the main 
interest in them of historian and jurist has been 
as a channel for the transmission of property. 
Theories about population and the fascinating 
pursuit of unravelling tangled economic laws, have 
obscured the fact that the attitude of a state to- 
ward children has been, with few variations, an 
index to its social progress. The same thing has 
been said of women, but while the Greeks treated 
women well, yet with the exception of the single 
dema* of Thebes, infanticide was common in all 
the Greek States. 
(The Chinese are kind to their women and yet 
there is no country today where infanticide is more 
common:) (The oldest civilization in the world, the 
Babylonian, was not one in which women were 
x #lian: the second book, chapter vii. 
“This is a Theban law most just and humane: that no Theban 
might expose his child or leave it in a wilderness, upon pain of 
death. But if the father were extremely poor, whether it were 
male or female, the law requires that as soon as it is born it be 
brought in the swaddling clouts to the magistrate, who, receiving 
it, delivers it to some other for some small reward, condition- 
ing with him that he shall bring up the child, and when it is 
grown up take it into his service, man or maid, and have the 
benefit of its labour in requital for its education.”
-P-A-G-E-36
  10 History of the Child 
ill-treated, yet all the indications are that infan- 
ticide was practised in the shape of human 
sacrifice,’ 
_ The Rajputs of India pleaded for their privilege 
of destroying infant children when theirs had been 
the highest civilization in the world. 
“In other words, disinterested affection for the 
infant is not necessarily coincident with civiliza- 
tion, or the kind treatment of women a sure sign 
that the lives of children are safe. 
Various writers, including Walt Whitman, 
Nietzsche, and Edward Carpenter, have taken the 
attitude that our much vaunted civilization does 
not really represent progress, and one vivacious 
author’ has even undertaken to show in a clever 
and lively way that there is no such thing as 
progress,(pointing to Greek civilization, in which 
children were killed at will and public men were 
confessed degenerates, as the ideal from which we 
of modern times have fallen away. 
What is undoubtedly true is that civilization 
does not always indicate social progress, and what 
is truer is that civilization does not necessarily 
indicate the humanization of the people.

says ‘‘Nothing human is alien to me,” is the

shown by Virgil is that of a great gentleness, a 
great humaneness,—a difference in their times,— 
and/yet Cicero, who represents the stoical and 
gentler sentiments of the Virgilian times toward 
the helpless and powerless victims of force as did 
no man up to his day, speaks tolerantly of the 
inhuman practices of his time.) But there is a 
growth of humaneness from Homer to Virgil, 
there is advance from Plato to Cicero, humanely 
speaking of course; there was greater advance in 
the teachings of Christ, and there was further ad- 
vance in the course of the long-drawn-out struggle 
between the nominal acceptance of those teachings 
and their incorporation into the daily philosophy. 
So, too, progress in the care of the rights of infancy 
and childhood has been made very little by very 
little. 
It is the fact that, until 1874, there was no organ- 
ized movement to defend the ‘‘rights” of children 
that led the author to investigate the conditions 
that had existed previous to that time. The first 
Child’s Protective Movement began in New York 
in the year mentioned, and the rapidity with which 
this spread throughout the world indicated that 
some general law, or as Brinton says, psycho- 
logical process was at work. Today there are pro- 
tecting societies in every country where there are 
Caucasian peoples. To go to the sources of the 
Child Protection Movement, it was necessary to 
understand the industrial conditions which arose 
in the nineteenth century, the eighteenth cen-

tury, and the latter part of the seventeenth, when 
the boast was made that children were at last 
being made useful. 
Back of the misuse of children in factories is the 
interesting story of the rise of modern industrial- 
ism with the early attempts of the guilds to pro- 
tect children, not so much out of any development 
of the human feelings as from the guild’s desire to 
protect the male labourer from unfair competition. 
The Decree of Napoleon in 1811,* declaring that 
the unprotected infant was a charge on the state, 
marked another advance in humanitarianism; 
back of this advance was the long and interesting 
story of the endeavours of the religious orders and 
the charitably disposed persons of the Middle 
Ages to save the lives of children, the most con- 
spicuous benefactor of childhood being the noble 
St. Vincent de Paul. It was he who gave to the 
golden glories of France’s golden age a touch of 
humanity that would otherwise have been lacking 
in the epoch ruled over by Mazarin and later the 
Great Louis. 
Leading up to the efforts of St. Vincent de Paul 
was that complex and interesting chapter of the 
mixing of the old German laws with the Roman 
laws, as the barbarians found them. 
That the semi-barbarous tribes that descended 
on Rome were better qualified to take up the hu- 
mane side of the Christian work than was the de- 
cadent Roman, we can assume from the statement 
1 See Appendix A.
-P-A-G-E-39
  Datheus and the Foundlings 13 
of Tacitus, that among the Germans children were 
treated more kindly than they were by the then 
ruling lords of the earth. 
Satire there may have been, as Guizot and Vol- 
taire suggest, in much that Tacitus wrote about the 
superior morality of the Germans, but later his- 
tory demonstrated their ethical superiority over 
the nation that was then on the verge of moral 
decay. ; 
In any case, as the Christian religion spread 
among the tribes that had enfiladed Rome, there 
are evidences of more humane consideration for 
children until we find Bishop Datheus as early as 
787 A.D. founding an asylum for children in a 
spirit strangely in advance of his time, though the 
bitter protests of the Christian fathers in the 
second century against the slaughter and misuse 
of children put the mark of infamy on the perse- 
cutors of children for all time. 
The Roman laws, as the barbarians found them, 
were the result of a slow growth of a thousand 
years from the time when the founder attempted 
to check the slaughter of young children by what 
must have been, in those primitive times, more or 
less drastic legislation. That the teachings of 
Christ and the teachings of the Stoics led to the 
same result does not detract from the credit due 
to Christianity for first putting on its proper basis, 
as we see things now, the standing of the child 
in the matter of its rights. 
Back of the Roman developments is the Greek

attitude toward children, disappointing, if we look 
for the perfection that we find in art and in philo- 
sophy, doubly disappointing when we find that 
both Plato and Aristotle saw the child only as a 
“possibility—only as something of which we must 
await developments—only as a human ovwm.) 
(When we come to trace the attitude of other 
races, of other civilizations, toward children, we 
find much the same story: out of barbarism, civi- 
lization; out of civilization, humanity, though it has 
been usually the great Semitic religions—Judaism, 
Christianity, and Mohammedanism—that have 
awakened the humane instinct the world over. The 
humane teachings of the Stoics were not unlike 
those of the great religious teachers, but, lacking 
the intense driving power of religious fervour, it 
is doubtful if they could have accomplished the 
revolutions that these three religions did. 
That all the great nations, the historical di- 
visions of the races, or those that passed out of 
barbarism into civilization, carried with them some 
trace of early cannibalistic days or child-murder 
days, seems a safe conclusion; and while occasional 
followers and interpreters of the Malthusian 
philosophy have at times attempted to defend 
indirectly these practices as part of the checks and 
balances by which over-population is defeated, 
the fact remains that the development of the 
parental instinct, the greatest of civilizing forces, 
has slowly, but surely, tended to put an end to 
these ‘‘checking” and ‘‘balancing”’ practices. /

hundred thousand years since the beginning of the 
Ghellian epoch, the pleistocene precursors under- 
went very few or slight specializations or develop- 
ments, a fact due mainly to the moderate and 
unchanging character of the climate during this 
long period. Progress in the arts, however, there 
was, to such an extent that in some things the 
period has not been equalled. Of this character 
are the exquisitely wrought flints of the Silurian 
period, which cannot be reproduced now. 
Primitive man as he existed in the Stone Age 
had very little in common with the ‘‘primitive 
men” of today. There are savages today who 
represent, in a way, a degree of savagery and a 
remoteness from civilization that in some respects 
takes them farther down the social ladder than 
any of the Aryan race of the Stone Age. ‘‘No 
pure primitive race exists in any part of the world 
today.”) Contact with more advanced races 
has invariably produced, sometimes a good and 
sometimes an evil effect. Races are what climate, 
soil, diet, pursuits, and inherited character make 
them,? and the Aryan savages of the Stone Age 
had a different set of these conditions to face from 
the Negro savages of today.

many respects represents the Stone Age period of 
civilization, displaying, together with the most 
barbarous customs, a wide knowledge of the arts, 
indicating that there had been contact with some 
higher race or its representatives. 
(Tribes grade into one another in the matter of 
culture so that it is hard to classify them.?) A 
struggle for existence may leave its mark on an 
advanced tribe so that while it may in general 
retain prominent barbaric or primitive character- 
istics, it will, in every other regard but these, seem 
an advanced tribe. (The Nigritans, for instance,? 
have learned from their neighbours, the Abyssini- 
ans and the Arabs, the use of iron; yet they have 
not arrived at the Stone and Bronze ages in cul- 
ture, and show in their social relations and domes- 
tic habits none of the characteristics of the more 
advanced tribes.) 
(So in the treatment of children. Wherever the 
treatment of the child is at variance with the other 
customs or conditions of the race, it will almost 
invariably be discovered that the change is due 
to economic reasons or to contact with a stronger 
race. That it is this contact with higher races 
that has helped undeveloped races to advance, is 
the opinion of Sir H. H. Johnson.3)

retrograde one. As we come to read the unwritten 
history of Africa by researches into languages, 
manners, customs, traditions, we seem to see a 
backward rather than a forward movement going 
on for some thousand years past—a return towards 
the savage and even the brute. I can believe it 
possible that, had Africa been more isolated from 
contact with the rest of the world, and cut off from 
the immigration of the Arab and the European, 
the purely Negroid races, left to themselves, so far 
from advancing towards a higher type of human- 
ity, might have actually reverted by degrees to a 
type no longer human.” 
On the other hand, G. Stanley Hall says that 
our intercourse with the African races ‘‘had been 
a curse and not a blessing. Our own Indians are 
men of the Stone Age whom Bishop Whipple 
thought originally the noblest men on earth. 
Look at them now!’’? 
Up to a short time ago men of authority asserted 
that marriage had sprung up from a ‘“‘state of 
promiscuity,’”’ the believers in this theory forget- 
ting that even ‘‘among animals the most akin to 
man, this state of promiscuity is rather excep- 
tional.” 
Most of the people cited as following this practice 
have been shown to have individual marriage to 
the exclusion of other forms. Undoubtedly in 
many cases what are called group marriages have 
*G. Stanley Hall, The Relations between the Lower and the 
Higher Races.

Origin of Marriage 19 
been mistaken for promiscuity. Almost equally 
low in the social scale is polyandry, where one 
woman may have several husbands. 
(Whatever the origin of marriage, the fact is, 
however, that the idea of marriage comes after 
the idea of the child—as in the animal world, the 
family is established for the purpose of taking 
care of the children that have been brought into 
the world.?) 
In Mahabharata, the Indian poem, we are told 
that marriage was founded by Swetaketu, son of 
the Rishi Uddalaka; according to the Chinese 
annals, the Emperor Fou-hi established the 
custom; the Egyptians ascribed its introduction 
to Menes, and the Greeks to Kerops. Nowhere 
is it assumed as a condition of the race of all time. 
(Its origin, growth, and development are really the 
“Origin, growth, and development of the idea of 
protecting human offspring. } 
A convincing scientific explanation of marriage, 
however, has been set forth by Westermarck.? 
Among the great sub-kingdom of the Invertebrata 
not even the female parent exhibits any anxiety 
about the offspring. The heat of the sun hatches 
the eggs of the highest order, the insects, and in 
most cases the mother does not even see her young. 3

3D. G. Brinton, Races and Peoples, p. 55. ‘‘The sequel of the 
sexual impulse is the formation of the family through the devel- 
opment of parental affection. This instinct is as strong in 
many of the lower animals as in human beings. In primitive  
-P-A-G-E-48
  20 History of the Child 
Parental care is rare among the lowest verte- 
brata. Among fishes the young are generally 
hatched without the assistance of the parents. 
There are exceptions to this among the Teleostei, 
where the male assumes the usual maternal func- 
tions of constructing a nest and jealously guarding 
the ova deposited there by the female. The 
male of certain species of the Arius, carries the 
ova in his pharynx. Nearly all of the reptiles, 
having placed their eggs in a convenient sunny 
spot, pay no more attention to them. 
With few exceptions, the relations of the sexes 
of the lower vertebrata can be described as fickle; 
they meet in the pairing time, part again, and have 
little more to do with one another. 
‘The Chelonia form,” says Westermarck, ‘‘with 
regard to their domestic habits, transition to the 
birds, as they do also from a zodlogical and par- 
ticularly from an embryological point of view.” 
He then goes on to show that parental affection 
in the latter class, not only on the side of the 
mother but on that of the father, has come to high 
development. Members of the two sexes aid 
each other in nest-building, the females bringing 
the materials and the males doing the work. Other 
duties which come with the mating season are 
conditions it is largely confined to the female parent, the father 
paying but slight attention to the welfare of his offspring. To 
this, rather than to doubt of paternity, should we attribute the 
very common habit in such communities of reckoning ancestry 
in the female line only.”

  Sharing Parental Duties 21 
shared by both, the mother being concerned with 
incubation and the father aiding her by taking 
her position when she leaves the nest for intervals, 
providing her with food which he gathers, and 
protecting her from dangers. When the breeding 
season is over and the young have come, a new 
set of duties is evolved. Young birds are not left 
alone by their parents, absences being necessitated 
only by searches for food for all members of the 
nest. When dangers threaten the nest both 
father and mother defend it bravely. 
All efforts are made to have the young shift for 
themselves as soon as they have grown strong 
enough to make it feasible. Independence and 
self-dependence come only after they are in all 
ways capable of meeting their needs. 
On the other hand, there are some species whose 
young, from the beginning of their ultra-oval 
existence, require and receive no care from the 
parents. (The duck is one of a species which leaves 
all parental care to the female. In general it may 
be said that both parents share the parental duties, 
the chief duties, such as hatching and rearing of 
the young, falling to the mother, while the father 
gathers food and keeps off enemies. *_) 
The relations of the two sexes are, therefore, 
very intimate, and association lasts even after the

sits on the eggs, and brings up the young birds, the female never 
troubling herself about either of these duties—Brehm, Bird-Life,

breeding season has passed. And only the birds 
of the Gallinaceous family are an exception to the 
tule of making such association permanent once it 
has been started, death alone ending it. 
(Real marriage is to be found only among birds.* 
For mammals the same cannot be said, for though 
the mother generally gives much attention to the 
young, the father does not always have as much 
concern. He even, in some cases, is the enemy of 
his own offspring, Yet even in the cases of mam- 
mals there are durable associations between the 
sexes. Very often these last only during the 
rutting season, but among whales, seals, hippo- 
potami, the Cervus campestris,? gazelles, the 
Neotragus Hemprichii and other small antelopes, 
reindeer, the Hydromus coypus, squirrels, moles, the 
ichneumon, and certain carnivorous animals, 
among the latter cats, martens, the yaguarundi 
of South America, and the Canis Brasiliensis and 
perhaps the wolf, there are durable matings. As- 
sociation between the sexes is common among all 
of these animals for periods after the young have 
been born. And in all cases the male is the 
family’s protector.)

of Prosimii are nursed by both male and female 
jin common. Among the Arctopitheci the female 
is always assisted by the male in taking care of 
the young. 
¢Y Coming to the man-like apes, we are told by 
Lieutenant de Crespigny that ‘‘in the northern 
part of Borneo they live in families—the male, 
female, and young one. On one occasion,” he 
says, ‘‘I found a family in which were two young 
ones, one of them much larger than the other, 
and I took this as a proof that the family tie had 
existed for at least two seasons. They build 
commodious nests in the trees which form their 
feeding-ground, and, so far as I could observe, the 
nests, which are well lined with dry leaves, are 
occupied only by the female and young, the male 
passing the night in the fork of the same or another 
tree in the vicinity. The nests are very numerous 
all over the forest, for they are not occupied above 
a few nights, the mias (or orang-utan) leading a 
roving life.” 
Dr. Savage says that the gorillas live in bands 
and that but one male is seen in every band. M. 
du Chaillu says that the male gorilla is always 
accompanied by the female. 
It is among the Negritians of Africa that we 
find today the at-hand evidence of the attitude 
of man toward his progeny in the first stages of 
culture, or perhaps the last stages of savagery. 
It must be remembered that in Africa, however, 
habits of other races will be found grafted on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  24 History of the Child 
negro stock, thereby causing them to appear some- 
times unusually gentle or again unusually ad- 
vanced. In Africa the Semitic and the Hamitic 
grafts on negro stock provide many varieties of 
mankind, just as in Oceania, the Mongol (Malay) 
and the Caucasian (Indonesian) grafts on the 
negro stock have produced many varieties there. 
As an example of the methods of the lowest of 
savage tribes, there is, however, no better ex- 
ample than the Papuans of New Guinea of whom 
the ethnologist, Keane, says: ‘‘They stand in 
some respects on the lowest rung of the social 
ladder.” 
As an example of the low state of culture in 
which part of them exist it is said that those near 
Astrolabe Bay on the north-west coast of New 
Guinea had no knowledge of the metals, all their 
implements being of stone, wood, or bones; neither 
had they knowledge of fire, the grandfathers of 
the present generation being able to recall the 
time when they had no fire at all, but ate their 
food raw. In the study of these people we are 
studying contemporaries of our own neolithic 
ancestors. 
According to their most popular myth, a croco- 
dile named Nugu was responsible for the frequent 
disappearance of children until the tribe made an 
agreement to supply him with pig’s fat instead. 
Here we have the beginning of the theory of 
sacrifice.

violent and cruel,” says Alfred Russell Wallace,* 
and an example of their idea of kindness may be 
gathered from the following description of the 
“ornamentation” of a young Papuan: 
“The faces of both men and women are fre- 
quently ornamented all over with cicatrices either 
circular or chevron-shaped. The operation is a 
painful and costly one, as the professional tattooer 
has to be highly paid for his trouble, and not every 
child’s friends can afford the fee demanded. The 
instrument used is the claw of the flying-fox. 
The unfortunate patient is not allowed to sleep 
for two or three nights before the operation is 
performed, and then, when he is ready to drop from 
weariness, the tattooer begins his work, and com- 
pletes it at one sitting. I never saw the actual 
process, but a child was brought for my inspection 
whose face had just been finished off. It was ina 
painful state of nervous irritation, and the face 
swelled to an enormous size.”’? 
Of the condition of these people no one is better 
able to speak than Lieutenant Governor J. H. P. 
Murray, who describes tribes where the savages 
have only weapons of wood, know nothing of the 
bow and arrow, and are noted for their immorality.

  26 — History of the Child 
young girls are sold by their parents as courtesans, 
the native name being Jelibo. I came across men 
married, and possessing, in addition, these women. 
Young fellows, not having reached puberty, had 
clubbed together in parties of three and four, and 
bought young girls from the parents to make 
courtesans. At feasts, these girls are used for 
the purpose of enriching themselves and their 
owners.”’? 
As to the attitude of the children, we gain some 
idea of the aboriginal point of view by this state- 
ment: 
“There are some villages in which children 
absolutely swarm, but there are few large families; 
practically every one is married, but there are 
many couples who have no children, or only one 
or two. In many parts of the territory it is con- 
sidered a disgrace for a woman to have a child 
until she has been married at least two years; 
infanticide and abortion, though rarely proved, 
are said to be common, and a medical expert would 
probably discover the existence of other checks 
to population. The result of all this is that in 
some districts the population is increasing while 
in others it is not; such investigations as we have 
been able to make lead, in the absence of definite 
statistics, to the conclusion that the population 
in that part of the territory which is under control 
is certainly not diminishing, though the increase, 
if any, is probably very small. The reason why 
1J. H. P. Murray, Papua or British New Guinea, 1912.
-P-A-G-E-59
  Burying Children Alive 27 
the population does not increase as one would 
expect now that village warfare has ceased is, as 
far as I can'see, simply that neither men nor women 
want children, which I take to be the chief cause 
that limits population elsewhere. The reason 
why they do not want them is, I think, partly 
because they find them a nuisance (which is a 
consideration that was probably effective even 
before the white man came) and partly that, in 
their present state of transition from one stage 
of development to another, they do not exactly 
see what there will be for their children to do.” 
Another custom of these people is to bury child- 
ten alive, when the parents or some person of 
importance dies; the excuse given for this practice 
is that the child will be needed to wait on the 
parent in the other world, a practice that lasted 
long among the civilized Egyptians. 
Cannibalism is rife among these people. Mr. 
Murray reports that on one occasion a young man 
was brought before him for having murdered a 
man in order to please a married woman with whom 
he was in love—a lover who has not ‘‘killed his 
man”’ being considered lukewarm. 
“On. my remonstrating with him on the impro- 
priety of paying attention to a married woman he 
informed me that there were no girls in the village, 
as they had all been killed and eaten in a recent 
raid. The position of a young man who found 
himself in a village where all the women were 
either married or eaten was no doubt a difficult  
-P-A-G-E-60
  28 History of the Child 
one, and I hope that_I took it into consideration 
in passing sentence.’’! 
How little is the feeling among these people 
over the murder of children, is shown from the 
fact that murder is the only outlet for their feelings! 
“T have known cases where a man, grieving 
over the loss of a relative or over some slight that 
has been put upon him, has set fire to his house, 
quite regardless of whether any one was inside, 
with the result, occasionally, that a child is burnt 
to death, and I recently tried a case of murder 
which was the direct outcome of grief over the 
death of a pig. The prisoners were brothers, and 
their pig bore the pretty name of Mehboma; but 
Mehboma died, and the brothers in their un- 
quenchable grief went forth and killed the first 
man they saw. The victim had nothing to do 
with Mehboma’s death, but the mourning brothers 
did not care for that—somebody had got to be 
killed over it. The prisoners told me that it was 
the custom of the village to show their grief in this 
way, so that their neighbours must occasionally 
have suffered rather severely.’’? 
As the Australians are closely allied to the Papu- 
ans and represent about the same period of cul- 
ture, we may postulate their attitude toward 
woman and a marriage from the description of an 
early Victorian tribe-marriage given by Brough 
Smith and quoted by A. H. Keane, the latter au-

culture is the treatment of their women, and in 
this respect the Australians must, as Prof. R. 
Semon shows, be ranked below the Bushman and 
ona level with the Fuegians.” 
“A man having a daughter of thirteen or four- 
teen years of age,’’ says Mr. Smith in his descrip- 
tion of the marriage customs in vogue among the 
Victorian tribes, ‘‘arranges with some elderly 
person for the disposal of her; and, when all are 
agreed, she is brought out and told that her 
husband wants her. .Perhaps she has never seen 
him but to loathe him. The father carries a spear 
and a waddy, or tomahawk, and, anticipating 
resistance, is thus prepared for it. The poor girl, 
sobbing and sighing, and muttering words of 
complaint, claims pity from those who will show 
none. If she resists the mandates of her father, 
he strikes her with his spear; if she rebels and 
screams, the blows are repeated; and if she at- 
tempts to run away, a stroke on the head from the 
waddy or tomahawk quiets her. The mother 
screams and scolds and beats the ground with her 
kan-nan (fighting-stick) ; the dogs bark and whine; 
but nothing interrupts the father, who, in the 
performance of his duty, is strict and mindful of 
the necessity of not only enforcing his authority, 
but of showing to all that he has the means to 
enforce it. Seizing the bride by her long hair he 
drags her to the home prepared for her by her new 
owner. Further resistance often subjects her to

the bridegroom does not hesitate to strike her 
savagely on the head with his waddy, and the 
bridal screams and yells make the night hideous.’’!

on the conditions among the Papuans and 
allied tribes as it appeared to me important 
that the very beginnings of the family should be 
understood. The general agreement of ethnolo- 
gists as to the low standing of the Papuans justifies, 
I believe, our assuming them tobe as near the point 
of culture of our neolithic (or paleolithic) ancestors 
as it is possible to come. 
From now on the course is upward. Strange 
as it may seem, the lowest tribes are less “human,” ~ 
both. the matter of offspring ¢ and in the matter 
of sentiment of love for women, than some of the 
beasts,2 and birds,* but having touched that depth, 
the next s step brings us in contact with feelings 
that, in a way, begin to approximate our own.

ren that she bears. Now begins the development of 
the parental affection. It is, however, confined to 
the female at first; ‘‘to this fact, rather than to 
doubt of paternity, should we attribute the very 
common habit in such communities of reckoning 
ancestry in the female line only.’’? 
Man, no longer relying on his own cannibalistic 
brute force to do with his progeny as he wishes, 
invents reasons for doing away with his burden- 
some offspring. 
(We have already seen that the Papuans re- 
stricted their families to two children, when it 
was possible. As late as the middle of the seven- 
teenth century, Dapper reported that in Benin 
no twins were found, as it was regarded as a sign 
, of dishonour for a woman to have twins.” 
(Among the Arunta tribes in Central Australia, 
* twins are ‘immediately killed as something which 
is unnatural.’ Among northern tribes they 
“are usually destroyed as something uncanny.’’4 
With the Kaffirs, it was found that ‘‘when twins 
are born, one is usually neglected and allowed to 
die.’’5 Of the western Victorian tribes we learn 
that ‘‘twins are as common among them as among 
Europeans; but as food is occasionally very scarce 
and a large family troublesome to move about,

it is lawful and customary to destroy the weaker 
twin child, irrespective of sex.”*/ 
(in some parts of the Benin territory, according 
to a contemporary of Dapper, the twin-bearing 
women are treated very badly:) 
(According to Nyendael, they actually kill both 
mother and infants, and sacrifice them to a certain 
devil, which they fondly imagine harbours in a 
wood near the village. ‘‘But if,” says this author- 
ity, ‘‘the man happens to be more than ordinarily 
tender, he generally buys off his wife, by sacrificing 
a female slave in her place; but the children are 
without possibility of redemption obliged to be 
made the satisfactory offerings which this savage 
law requires. In the year 1699, a merchant’s 
wife, commonly called ellaroe or mof, lay-in of two 
children, and her husband redeemed her with a 
slave, but sacrificed his children. After which I 
had frequent opportunities of seeing and talking 
with the disconsolate mother, who never could see 
an infant without a very melancholy reflection 
on the fate of her own, which always extorted 
briny tears from her. The following year the like 
event happened toa priest’s wife. She was deliv- 
ered of two children, which, with a slave, instead 
of his wife, he was obliged to kill and sacrifice with 
his own hands, by reason of his sacerdotal function; 
and exactly one year after, as though it had been 
a punishment inflicted from heaven, the same 
woman was the second time delivered of two child-

ren, but how the priest managed himself on this 
occasion I have not been informed, but am apt to 
think that this poor woman was forced to atone 
for her fertility by death. These dismal events 
have in process of time made such impressions on 
men, that when the time of their wives’ delivery 
approaches, they send them to another country; 
which makes me believe that forthe future they 
will correct these inhumanities.’’* ) 
(On the west coast of Africa ‘‘twins are killed 
among all the Niger Delta tribes, and in districts 
out of English control the mother is killed too,’’? 
which shows the fanatic point to which a belief, 
or rather an excuse, founded on the economic desire 
to keep down the size of a family, may be carried. 
All Kaffir children are neglected, according to 
Kidd, but on the birth of twins, ‘‘one frequently 
is killed by the father, for the natives think that 
unless the father places a lump of earth in the 
mouth of one of the babies, he will lose his 
strength.”’ 
The next provision to keep down the ‘‘cost of 
living”’ is directed against children with blemishes, 
a practice that was not easy to check even among 
civilized peoples. Among the Australian aborigines 
“it is usual to destroy those that are malformed.” 45)

  “Unlucky” Birthdays 35 
(Among certain tribes on the west coast, children 
whose mothers have died are thrown into the 
bush, ‘‘as are all children who have not arrived in 
this world in the way considered orthodox or who 
cut their teeth in an improper way.’ A child 
born with teeth is put to death, in some parts of 
Africa; children born in stormy weather are 
destroyed in Kamchatka. In Madagascar ‘‘the 
superstition of lucky and unlucky days prevailed 
throughout all the tribes, and the unfortunate 
infants that came into the world on one of_these 
unlucky days were immediately destroyed.” 7/ 
( How obvious are the so-called reasons for killing 
the children may be seen from the fact that accord- 
ing to another authority, the proscribed or un- 
lucky periods and days include all children born 
in March and April, or in the last week of each 
month, or on Wednesdays and Fridays. Among 
the Antankarana tribes of the Amber Mountains 
in Madagascar, a child that sneezes at or shortly 
after its birth is exposed. Among the Basuto, 
when a child is born with its feet first, it is killed, 4 
whereas among the Bondei it is killed if it is born 
head first. 
/ Among the Bondei, the excuses found for killing 
children are many. If the child is born head

if it cries, itis a kigego and is strangled. If the 
father has not been in the galo (kekutoigwa), or 
the mother has not been in the kiwanga (kekuvi- 
niwa) (initiated), the child is a tumbwi (offence) 
and is strangled.” ) 
(Mental processes the world over are much the 
same. The American legislator raising the tariff 
to keep out competitors is not employing a system 
entirely dissimilar from that of the barbarians 
who, finding the first proscriptions fail to keep 
down the birth-rate, widen the scope of the pro- 
scription. And so the customary law grows to 
include female children among the proscribed. 
Writing in the latter part of the eighteenth cen- 
tury, Don Felix de Azara declared he had found 
that among the Guanas in South America it was 
the custom for the women to bury alive the major- 
ity of the female children, and that they_never 
brought up more than one boy and one girl.?/ 
Rude attempts to regulate the number of 
children next appeared. It has been suggested 
that this phase of primitive development argues 
mentality sufficient to foresee destruction of the 
tribe that does not provide for the future. Doubt- 
less, in the mind of some savage Malthus, the 
idea that the tribe must allow at least a given

number of children to live, was conceived with 
the warm glow of discovery. 
G Among the Tokelaus, or Line Islanders, ‘‘no 
married pair are allowed by their law to have or 
bear more than four children; that is, only four 
get the chance of life. The woman has a right 
to rear, or endeavour to rear, one child. It rests 
with the husband to decide how many more shall 
live, and this depends on how much land there is 
to divide.” ) 
On Radack Island a woman ‘“‘is allowed to bring 
up only three children; her fourth and every suc- 
ceeding one she is obliged to bury alive herself.’ 
(Two boys and one girl were all that the Aus- 
tralian mother brought up, according to Curr, al- 
though the women bore an average of six children. 3 
(Economie ingenuity—and trepidity—could go 
no further than the practice in the Solomon Is- 
lands, where ‘‘a small portion of the Ugi natives 
have been born on the island, three-fourths of them 
having been brought as youths to supply the place 
of offspring killed in infancy. When a man needs 
support in his declining years, his props are not 
his own sons, but youths obtained by purchases 
from the St. Christoval natives.”4 Another 
author says of the same islands that when ‘‘it

becomes necessary to buy other children from other 
tribes good care is taken not to buy them too 
young.” ) 
(At Vaitupu, of the Ellice Islands, ‘‘only two 
children are allowed to a family, as they are afraid 
of a scarcity of food.? It is on these coral islands 
that Robert Louis Stevenson says the fear of 
famine is greatest. He bears out the statement 
that only two children were allowed to a marriage 
on Vaitupu Island, and adds that on Nukufetu 
only one child was permitted; ‘‘on the latter the 
punishment was by fine, and it is related that_the 
fine was sometimes paid and the child spared.” 
(In the Dieyerie tribe, of Australia, “‘thirty per 
cent. are murdered by their mothers at their birth, 
simply for the reasons—firstly, that many of them, 
marrying very young, their first-born is considered 
immature and not worth preserving; and secondly, 
because they do not wish to be at the trouble of 
rearing them, especially if weakly. Indeed all 
sickly and deformed children are made away with 
in fear of their becoming a burthen to the tribe.’’3

jero offer up their ‘‘first-born sons as sacrifices, 
because, once upon a time, when summer and 
winter were jumbled together in bad season, and 
the fruits of the field would not ripen, the sooth- 
sayers enjoined it.” *) 
CAfter telling an almost unprintable tale, Dr. 
Brinton says of the Australian blacks that ‘‘among 
several tribes it was an established custom for 
a mother to kill and eat her first child, as it 
was believed to strengthen her for later births. ) 
C‘In the Luritcha tribe, young children are 
sometimes killed and eaten, and it is not an infre- 
quent custom, when a child is in weak health, to 
kill a younger and healthy one and then to feed 
the weakling on its flesh, the idea being that this 
will give to the weak child the strength of the 
stronger one.’’? 
(Frank admission that the children are in the 
way and are a burden, may be regarded either as 
a sign that the tribe has progressed, or that it has 
not yet reached the point of shame where it 
cloaks the evil practice under the guise of religious 
sacrifices, hygienic or customary regulations. ) 
(In this regard it is not possible to say that the 
father, as opposed to the mother, is more inclined 
to do away with offspring, or is more frequently 
entrusted with that grewsome duty, although I 
would venture to say that an exhaustive research

  40 History of the Child 
on this one aspect of the study would probably 
show that the mother at first opposed and gradu- 
ally accepted, under the force of man’s will, the 
idea that the destruction of her offspring was good; 
first for herself and her lord and master, and 
secondly for the tribe. ) 
‘Should investigation uphold such an hypothesis, 
it would be easily understood how the frank 
acknowledgment represented an advanced stage, 
when the woman, no longer satisfied with the 
various trivial excuses offered for the destruction 
of her young, insisted on keeping them alive, and 
was met with, not the many invented reasons 
that we have seen, but the plain truth, that their 
continued existence endangered the food supply. ) 
CUrgent want and sterility of the niggardly 
earth’’ were the reasons given by the natives of 
the island of Radnack for the law limiting the 
number of children.t A second child is killed 
among the natives of Central Australia ‘‘only 
when the mother is, or thinks she is, unable to 
rear it”? and yet the same authors say that ‘‘an 
Australian native never looks far enough ahead 
to consider what will be the effect on the food 
supply in future years, if he allows a particular 
child to live; what affects him is simply the ques- 
tion of how it will interfere with the work of his 
wife so far as their own camp is concerned; while,

from the woman’s side, the question is, can she 
provide food enough for the new-born infant and 
the next youngest ?”: / 
(The long suckling time, that these authors and 
other travellers have noted, and that is here given 
as a reason, as opposed to the economic one, for 
the frequent killing of children, is due ‘‘chiefly 
to want of soft food and animal milk.*) 
( Among the members of the Areoi society, a 
peculiar and somewhat ‘“‘secret” society of the 
islands of the Pacific, ‘‘a man with three or four 
children, and this was a rare occurrence, was said 
to be a éaata taubuubuu, a man with an unwieldy 
or cumbrous burden; and there is reason to believe 
that, simply to avoid the trifling care and effort Z 
necessary to provide for their offspring during the 
helpless period of infancy and childhood, multi- 
tudes were consigned to an untimely grave.” A 
Malthusian motive has sometimes been adduced, 
and the natives have been heard to say, that if all 
the children born were allowed to live, there would 
not be food enough produced in the islands to 
support them. 4 
( From many authorities comes direct evidence 
of a clash between the man and the woman in the 
Polynesian Islands. ‘‘As the burden of the plan- 
tation and other work devolves on the woman, she

thinks that she cannot attend to more than two or 
three children, and the rest must be buried as soon 
as they are born. There are exceptions to this 
want of maternal affection. At times the husband 
urges the thing contrary to the wishes of the wife. 
If he thinks the infant will interfere with her 
work, he forcibly takes the little innocent and 
buries it, and she, poor woman, cries for months 
after her child.’”*) 
Among the nomadic tribes it is frankly admitted 
that the children are a hindrance. The Lenguas, 
of the Paraguayan Chaco, make journeys of from 
ten to twenty miles, the women doing most of 
the hard work. The consequence is that children 
are not desirable. So with the Abipones, of whom 
Charlevoix says: ‘‘They seldom rear but one child 
of each sex, murdering the rest as fast as they come 
into the world, till the eldest are strong enough to 
walk alone. They think to justify this cruelty 
by saying that, as they are almost constantly 
travelling from one place to another, it is impos- 
sible for them to take care of more infants than 
two at a time; one to be carried by the father, and 
the other by the mother.”? ) 
(The explanation offered by the Kurnai was that 
“St was often difficult to carry about young child-

ascends. The unfavourable conditions into which 
nomadic tribes frequently come produce not 
infrequently, a perverted type that is lower than 
the animals to which our semi-human progenitors 
of the extremely remote past belonged. ( “The 
instincts of the lower animals,’ says Darwin, ‘‘are 
never so perverted as to lead them to regularly 
destroy their own offspring or to be quite devoid of 
jealousy.” 
In parts of New South Wales, such as Bathurst, 
Goulburn, and the Lachlan, or Macquarie, ‘‘it was 
customary long ago for the first-born of every 
lubra to be eaten by the tribe, as part of a religious 
ceremony; and I recollect,” says J. M. Davis, ‘‘a 
black fellow who had, in compliance with the 
custom, been thrown when an infant on the fire, 
but was rescued and brought up by some stock- 
keepers who happened accidentally to be passing 
at the time.”? 
Ellis declares that among the Marquesans who 
inhabit a group of islands to the south-east of 
Hawaii, children are sometimes, during ‘‘seasons 
of extreme scarcity, killed and eaten by their 
parents to satisfy hunger.’’3)

and nation. ( It might with equal force be said 
that the attittide of the tribe or nation toward its 
young is also a barometer of progress. Behind 
the harsh measure and savage customs, under- 
neath the cruelty and at times ferocious indiffer- 
ence to pain, there is in general among the lowest 
of the tribes an affection for their young, once it 
has been decided that they are allowed to live.) 
(In that too frequently suppressed affection, 
stunted as it is by customary law and the unequal 
struggle with nature, there is the beginning of 
humanitarian progress. Given reasonable secu- 
rity that there will be a sufficiency of food supply 
and a surcease of neighbourhood wars, this affec- 
tion will pass from precept to concept and protect 
even the unborn.t ) 
(‘‘No people in the world are so fond of, or so 
long-suffering with, children,” Stevenson says of 
the same South Sea Islanders among whom he has 
just said infanticide is common.? But even after 
it has been decided to bring up the child, and it 
has become an object of great affection, it is still in 
danger should famine conditions seem imminent, $ 
or should the cupidity and avarice of the parents 
be aroused, with the consequence that children 
are readily sold into slavery.

  South Sea Island Customs 45 
Nature’s methods are stern, and her progress 
slow; despite perplexing examples of reactionary 
forces, the primitive move is steadily toward an 
understanding of one’s duties as a human being— 
or he dies. For the civilized man, pain is nature’s 
warning that he has violated the rules of his own 
body, and for the primitive man, decay and despair 
are the warnings that the path of progress lies 
the other way. 
Looking over this vast field, including not only 
blacks, Mongols, and Indians, but even the Euro- 
peans, as we shall come to see later, we gather that 
those that have struggled upward have been only 
those who have taken nature’s lesson of lessons 
to themselves. Horrible as is the story of these 
stationary and degenerate peoples that we get, 
what must be the whole story, with its full picture 
of anguish?

people show that the years of civilization or near- 
civilization have not changed the primitive roving 
inclinations, inclinations that partly account for 
the indifference to child life among the Chinese. ) | 
(Our knowledge of ancient China rests prin- 
cipally on two authorities, the Chou King of 
Confucius, written 484 B.c., and the Sse Ki of Tsse 
Ma Thsein, written at the beginning of the first 
era before Christ. Confucius was not able to go 
further back than seventeen centuries before his 
own time, so that we can safely say that we know 
something about Chinese history for about 2200 
years before the Christian era. The social and 
political life of the Chinese people in the time of 
Yao, the first of the emperors named by Confucius, 
was that of a pastoral people, but even then most 
of the useful arts had been invented, writing was 
already known, and the first notions of astronomy 
on which they founded their calendar had been 
acquired. The successor of Yao was Chun, and 
after Chun came Hia, the founder of a dynasty 
which lasted from 2205 to 1767 B.c., with which 
dynasty began the real history of China. 
(When Confucius appeared the Chinese Empire 
was a highly civilized nation, but of Confucius 
it has been said that he, more than any other one 
man, went to make China a nation. Born at a 
time when his country was torn with discord and 
desolated by war, husbandry neglected, peace of 
households destroyed, and plunder and rapine

48 History of the Child 
common occurrences, Confucius was nineteen when 
he married and added to the national woes his 
own domestic troubles, divorcing the lady after a 
brief period in captivity, but not however until 
she had borne him a son. 
CIt is through this son that we learn something 
of the personal character of Confucius. An in- 
quisitive disciple asked the son if he had learned 
any more than those who were not related to the 
great teacher. ) 
“No,” replied Le. ‘‘He was standing alone 
once when I was passing through the court below 
with hasty steps, and said to me: 
“Fave you read the Odes?’ 
“On my replying, ‘Not yet,’ he added: 
““Tf you do not learn the Odes, you will not 
be fit to converse with.’ 
“Another day in the same way and the same 
place, he said to me: 
“““Have you read the rules of Propriety?’ 
“On my replying ‘Not yet,’ he added: 
“““Tf you do not learn the rules of Propriety, 
your character cannot be established.’ ”/ 
“‘T asked one thing,” said the enthusiastic dis- 
ciple, ‘‘and I have learned three things. I have 
learned about the Odes, I have learned about the 
rules of Propriety, and I have learned that the 
Superior Man maintains a distant reserve toward 
his son.” 
(In this anecdote—and in his works—it is evi- 
dent that Confucius had the Chinese estimate of
-P-A-G-E-85
         Confucius and Parental Sovereignty 49 
the child—the father was sovereign; the child, 
as long as that sovereign lived, a mere subject. 
It was this idea and the strongly implanted idea 
of filial piety that led to the callous attitude 
toward children among the disciples of Confucius. 
(The Chinese explanation and defence of this 
phase of their life is that up to the year 232 B.C. 
there did not exist in China anything but the most 
humane system of treatment of children.) (The 
Jesuit authors of the Mémoires declare that up 
to that time there is no trace of the drowning of 
infants, their abandonment, etc. Instead of being 
a burden, says the missionary chronicler, children 
were considered an asset and the orphan was gen- 
erally in the position of having to choose between 
many would-be adoptive parents. The law is 
cited to prove this, the Code declaring that in 
case there were several people anxious to adopt 
an orphan, preference should be given to those 
who were childless. *) 
(It was under Ts’in Chi Hoang,? who reigned 
about 232 B.c., that the abominable practice grew 
up, along with many other ills. The greed and 
avarice of the nobies and the Emperor’s immediate 
following produced much suffering, in the wake 
of which came famine, causing mothers and fathers 
to abandon children that they were not able to 
feed. )

  50 History of the Child 
Whatever truth there may be in this statement, 
there is very little doubt that the reign of Ts’in 
Chi Hoang was one of bloodshed, war, and suffer- 
ing and that with the end of the Chou (or Chow), 
dynasty, and the accession of the Prince Ts’in, 
first as the dominating King and then as Emperor 
of China, there was much suffering.) 
(‘It was a time of extreme severity,” says the 
historian Tsse Ma Thsien, ‘“‘and all affairs were 
decided according to the law without either grace 
or charity.”’* 
In addition to his bloodthirsty qualities, the 
Prince Ts’in, who was known as the Great First 
Emperor and who insisted that all successors 
should be known as the Second, Third, and Fourth 
Emperors, was superbly egotistic. Everything, 
including literature, was ordained to begin from 
his reign, to which end he issued an edict that all 
books should be burned. He put to death so 
many hundred of the literati who refused to obey 
this edict that the ‘‘melons actually grew in winter 
on the spot beneath which the bodies were buried’’? 
—a tribute to the fertile character of the Chinese 
literati.)

ten as we know it today did not extend farther 
back than the period ascribed to it by the Catholic 
missionaries, the period of Ts’in Chi Hoang, the

      Chinese Severity 51 
earliest records of the Chinese indicate that the 
family was placed on a plane that, for severity 
toward children, challenges even the Roman patria 
potestas. To the Emperor Yao or Yau, who is 
supposed to have reigned about 2300 years before 
Christ, is ascribed the first step in establishing the 
Chinese attitude toward parents and the respect- 
ful obedience exacted from children. Particular 
emphasis was laid on the son’s obedience. It was 
apparently taken for granted that a daughter 
would not be rebellious.) 
( Having occupied the throne a long time, Yao, 
as it is said, called his ministers about him and, 
telling them that he had now reigned for more than 
seventy years, expressed his willingness to abdicate 
in favour of any one who felt capable of taking 
the Emperor’s place. When no one volunteered 
—they were wise Chinese—he asked them to sug- 
gest someone who was deserving of charity. 
“Yu Chun,” answered the ministers, ‘‘though 
an aged man, is without a wife and comes from an 
obscure family. Though his father was blind 
and of neither talent nor mind, and his mother a 
wicked woman by whom he was mistreated, and 
though his brother Siang is full of pride, he has 
observed the rules of filial obedience and has lived 
in peace and has gradually improved the condition 
of his family.” 
( ‘‘Then,” replied the Emperor, ‘“‘I shall give 
him my two daughters in marriage and he shall 
succeed me on the throne to the exclusion of my 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
52 History of the Child 
son, Ly, who has shown himself to be unworthy 
by his lack of respect for his parents.”’ 
And it was this Yu Chun, it is said, who fur- 
ther established the Chinese principles of morality, 
by which the family and not the individual shaped 
the progress of the nation. » 
How well established those principles became 
may be seen from the Li Ki, which was composed 
about a thousand years later. This is a code or 
book of ceremonials on the civil life, composed or 
put together by or under the patronage of Tscheou 
Kong, uncle of the Emperor Tchin Ouang, in 
II45 B.C. 
““A son,” says the Li Ki, ‘‘possesses nothing 
while his parents are living. He cannot even 
expose his life for a friend.” 
““A son has received his life from his father and 
his mother,” says Confucius in the Hiao King, 
composed 480 B.c., ‘‘and this gives them rights 
over him that are above all others.” 
In the legend of How Tseih, the founder of the 
House of Chow, whose mother was Keang Yuen 
and whose father was ‘‘a toe print made by God,”’ 
the adventures of the child are thus described:) 
He was placed in a narrow lane, 
But the sheep and oxen protected him with loving care. 
He was placed in a wide forest, 
Where he was met with by the wood-cutters. 
He was placed on the cold ice,

   And a bird screened and supported him with its wings. 
When the bird went away 
How Tseih began to wail. 
His cry was long and loud 
So that his voice filled the whole way. 
_No indication is given in the ode as to who was 
responsible for exposing the infant to these dangers, 
but just as in other mythologies in which the heroes 
or near-gods survive the dangers of infancy, there 
is no doubt that this Chinese hero was pictured as 
having overlived dangers that were the common 
lot of the average child. The commentators take 
different views of the person responsible for the 
dangers to which How Tseih was subjected, Maou 
believing that it was the father, the Emperor 
K’uh; Ch’ing on the contrary holding that it was 
Keang Yuen, the mother, who did it herself but 
not for the purpose of getting rid of the child so 
much as to show what a ‘“‘marvellous gift he was 
from Heaven.”’* 
It is not that there are not occasional tender 
strains in the ode. Number seven in the Odes 
of Ts’e, the poet, sings: 
How young and tender 
Is the child with his two tufts of hair. 
When you see him after not so long a time 
Lo! He is wearing the cap.?

54 History of the Child 
Writing later the Emperor Tai Tsong, the author 
of a book called the Mirror of Gold, repeated these 
ideas on ancestor worship in the following ordi- 
nance (627 to 650 A.D.): 
“The foundation of all the virtues is filial piety. 
It is the first thing to learn and I in my youth have 
received the right lessons. I have done my best 
to place at ease all my subjects to the end that 
the parents might be in a state to bring their 
children up properly and that infants in their 
turn might acquit themselves of their duties toward 
their parents. 
“When the virtue of filial piety flourishes, then 
all other virtues will follow. In order that the 
Empire may know that such is my desire and that 
it is nearest to my heart, I now order that there 
be distributed in my name and my account to all 
those who are known for their filial piety, five 
large measures of rice. To those who have passed 
their eightieth year, two measures; to those of 
ninety years, three measures; . . . Moreover one 
shall give, commencing with the first moon, to 
each woman who gives birth to a son, a measure 
of rice.” 
\ But twice is there mention of human sacrifice 
in the Chu’un Ts’ew but both references indicate 
that there was little regard for honour as well as 
for human life. In the account of the reign of 
Duke He, who ruled from 658 to 626 B.c., it is 
said that when the Viscount Tsang went to cove- 
nant with the people of Choo, the Viscount was

sacrificed as an animal might be sacrificed on an 
altar built on the banks of the Suy in order that 
the wild tribes of the East might be frightened 
and ‘‘drawn toward him.’’? ) 
Cin the twelfth year of the reign of Duke Ch’aou, 
who was Marquis of Loo from B.c. 540 to 509, the 
army of Ts’oo seized Yew (Yin) and sacrificed 
him on Mount Kang.’ > 
C Not until the reign of Choen Tche (1633 to 1662 
A.D.) was there any movement to check the slaugh- 
ter of infants. Then it was found that infanticide 
had desolated so many of the provinces that it 
was necessary for this Emperor, the founder of 
the Tsing dynasty, to condemn the crime and 
warn the inhabitants of Hang Hoi, of Kiang Sou, 
and of Fou-kien that the practice must stop. ) 
( The first official document endeavouring to save 
the children was dated the second day of the 
third moon, 1659, and was an appeal to the Em- 
peror by an under-official. ) 
( “The Supreme King,” it begins, ‘‘loves to give 
life and to prevent destruction. All men have 
received from Heaven a pitying heart. But the 
corruption of morals comes between the father 
and the child and causes men to be guilty of cru- 
elty. I, your humble subject, have learned that 
in the provinces of Kiang Nan, Kiang Si, and Fou 
Kien there exists the barbarous custom of drowning 
little girls.” )

  56 History of the Child 
_ The request of the official for an imperial edict 
against the practice was approved by Choen Tche, 
who condemned the murder of female children and 
ordered the mandarins of the provinces named to 
use means to check the practice. On the twenty- 
third day of the third moon in the same year in 
the presence of his advisers, he issued the following 
edict: 
“We had heard that there were people who 
drowned their girl children but we had not been 
able to believe it. Today our censor T’Kiai 
having addressed to us a petition on this unholy 
practice, we are led to believe that it must really 
exist. 
“The paternal emotions come from nature and 
there ought not be any difference in the manner 
of treating sons and daughters. Why should 
parents conduct themselves cruelly toward girl 
babies and condemn them to death? Meng Tse 
has said: 
“When one sees an infant on the point of 
falling into a well every man feels in his heart the 
sentiments of fear and compassion.’ 
“Here, however, it is not a question of strangers 
or of passers-by. Since all men are moved at the 
sight of an infant in danger when that infant is a 
stranger, what kind of parents must those be who 
deprive their own children of life? What excesses 
are they not capable of when they can commit 
such crimes? /

that all beings might enjoy themselves without 
harm. But if a mother and father destroy the 
child to which they have given life, how can they 
help but see in that act a blot in the celestial 
harmony? 
C “Tf flood and famine, war and pestilence, visit 
their terrors on the people, it is because these mis- 
fortunes are the punishments for the crimes spoken 
of. The ancient Emperors wept bitterly over 
these faults of the people and pardoned crimes, 
and by that spirit imitated the Spirit of Heaven, 
who loves to give life. When one of our officers 
addresses us a report concerning a great wrong, 
we first look to save the life; if it is not possible to 
use clemency, and if it is necessary that we pro- 
nounce the sentence of death, such a decision 
causes us genuine sadness. How great ought to 
be our sorrow, however, at the sight of an infant, 
that had hardly been born, condemned to death. 
iG “Although the mandarins have prohibited this 
custom, all people are probably not aware of the 
prohibition. Measures must therefore be taken 
to bring this prohibition to the knowledge of all 
and an end must be put to this custom. Not 
until then will we be joyous and content.» 
(‘Ho Long Tou in his book entitled On Abstain- 
ing from Drowning Litile Girls has written these 
words: 
“““The Tiger and the Wolf are very cruel but 
they understand the relations that should exist 
between the parent and its offspring. Why then 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  58 History of the Child 
should man, gifted as is no animal, show himself 
to be on a lower plane? Our infants, boys and 
girls, are equally the fruit of our bodies. I have 
heard that the sad cry uttered by these girl babies 
as they are plunged into a vase of water and 
drowned is inexpressible. Alas! that the_heart 
of a father or a mother should be so cruel.’ ””) 
( Choen Tche then makes an appeal to his subjects 
asking them not to tolerate further this barbarous 
custom, dwelling on the superior and more gentle 
quality of daughters over sons, citing historical 
instances of the good fortune that many daughters 
had brought to their parents, and concluding by 
promising the benediction of Heaven on those who 
would protect the lives of the little females.) 
Choen Tche (or Shun Chih) was the ninth son 
of T’ien Ts’ung and was left to the care of his 
uncle as regent. His reign was marked by an 
endeavour to consolidate the newly acquired 
empire. His biographers speak of his magnanim- 
ity as a ruler and he was much praised by his 
contemporaries. The fact that he treated the 
Catholic missionaries with favour may also par- 
tially explain his horror over the conditions of 
which he was apparently ignorant until the 
protest. 
( Choen Tche’s reign also marked the beginning 
of many modern things in the history of China. 
It was during his life that there took place the 
first diplomatic intercourse between the govern- 
ment of the Middle Kingdom and the European  
-P-A-G-E-97
  Beginning of many Modern Practices 59 
nations, both the Dutch and the Russians having 
had an embassy resident at Pekin during 1656, 
but although both were treated most politely, 
neither achieved the substantial gains they sought." 
It was during his reign too that tea was first intro- 
duced to England and a substitute produced for 
the quart of ale with which even Lady Jane Grey 
washed down her morning bacon. } 
It was, however, under the reign of Kang Hi, 
the son of Choen Tche, that the modern attitude 
toward children was approximated. The great 
works of Kang Hi and his long reign have obscured 
the wisdom and moderation of Choen Tche. One 
of Kang Hi’s first acts was to abolish for all time 
the eunuchs, a law being passed and engraven on 
metals that it might stand the ravages of time, 
forbidding for all time the employment in public 
service of this class of person, and the Manchus, 
until the time they gave up the sceptre a few years 
ago, held to their word. Thus passed out of 
Chinese history its most industrious class of 
trouble makers. 
But two years after the death of Choen Tche, 
a writer named Li Li Ong collected the edicts 
that were being issued by mandarins to show 
the spread of vice among the people. Among 
this collection was the following addressed to the 
governor of the province of Tche Kiang by the 
mandarin, Ki Eul Jia, prefect of Yen Tcheou: )

(‘The Heaven and the Earth love to shower 
benefits on man and to conserve life. But alas! 
the inhabitants of this prefecture of Yen Tcheou 
have the habit of drowning their girl babies. The 
tich as well as the poor have been found to be 
guilty of thiscrime. The tiger, despite his cruelty, 
does not devour his young, and it is hard to think 
that man should be insensible to the cries of his 
drowning infant. I myself have witnessed such 
drownings and that is why I ask that you send 
into my six districts a proclamation strictly pro- 
hibiting infanticide. It will be printed on stone. 
If any one should then be guilty of the crime, his 
neighbours should be encouraged to notify the 
magistrates that he might be dealt with according 
tolaw. As you are charged to maintain morality 
among the people, I propose that you use this 
means.’’ ) 
\ Whether this suggestion was taken or not, it is 
known that in that particular province infanticide 
increased instead of diminished. The particularly 
interesting part of this document is that it brings 
to light the fact from an official source that the 
tich as well as the poor were the offenders and 
that it was not lack of food alone that made this 
practice so common in China. 
Even in modern times this is so, a midwife who 
was asked in recent years to become a Christian 
saying that it was impossible inasmuch as it in- 
terfered with her business. She said that fre- 
quently she was asked by wealthy people to drown

courage to kill themselves.* 
(In 1720 Father d’Entrcolles translated a manual 
for the use of mandarins which bore the title The 
Perfect Happiness of the People and which contained 
a plan for a ‘‘ House of Pity for homeless infants’’? 
and an exhortation to put such a plan into execu- 
tion, declaring that in times past there had been 
such institutions for the reception of orphans 
and homeless children and that nurses had been 
provided for them when they had been rescued. ) 
The next proclamation of which we have any 
knowledge was that issued with the approval of 
the Emperor Kien Long, who reigned from 1736 ° 
to 1796. In1772, Ngeou Yang Yun Ki addressed 
to the Emperor, in the thirty-seventh year and 
the twenty-ninth day of the tenth moon of his 
reign, a communication in which it was stated that 
the poor families had been obliged to drown their 
daughters because they had not had enough food. 
Permission was asked to inflict on the person who 
committed this crime, the penalty of sixty blows 
from a cane, and a year in exile. In 1773 the 
Emperor Kien Long himself issued the following 
edict against infanticide: > 
‘The statutes fixing the penalty for the murder 
of a grown-up child or a small child presuppose 
that the child has not failed to obey the orders 
of its parents or grandparents, and cover cases

where the infants are murdered deliberately and 
with premeditation. This crime, which violates 
the laws of nature, should be punished with the 
whip and with banishment. If the infants that 
are thus killed are but newly-born and therefore 
without intelligence and reason, the guilty can- 
not plead the disobedience of these daughters as 
an excuse for their crimes. Therefore henceforth 
whenever any one following the barbarous custom 
shall drown his infants, he will be prosecuted for 
murder with premeditation, and when the proof 
has been properly established before the proper 
tribunals he will receive a sentence equal to that 
which is meted out to the parents or grand- 
parents who voluntarily assassinate their children. 
It is not necessary to ite. a special ordinance. 
Let all respect this decree.”’ 
A dozen years later another voice was raised 
in protest against the drowning of girls. Chen, 
Treasurer General of the province of Kiang Sou, 
presented to the governor of that province a pro- 
clamation against infanticide and begged him to 
publish it.) 
In 1815 a writer named Ou Sing King made an 
appeal to the officials of China to stop the drown- 
ing of infants and the sale of women, and this appeal 
falling into the hands of the Emperor Kia King, 
a proclamation was issued against both vices. 
The writer, Ou Sing King, was given imperial 
permission to go further in his investigations.

the then governor of the province of Tche Kiang, 
believing that the expensive wedding gifts were 
the real cause of the child murder, decreed:) 
Cit is ordered that ornaments of gold, pearls, 
precious stones, and embroidered gowns are for- 
bidden at all marriages. As for silver ornaments, 
silks, and other materials, this is the rule that we 
hereby establish: ) 
“For rich families the sum set out for such 
purchases must not be over one hundred taels. 
For people of medium fortune the expense must 
be limited to from forty to fifty taels. Those of 
inferior blood must not spend more than twenty 
or thirty taels and the poorest people must not 
go beyond two or five.* ) 
( “As for gifts by the parents to the husband, the 
quantity is left to their discretion; this being the 
means to avoid all dispute. After the marriage, 
on certain occasions, it is permitted to make one 
or two presents. The celebrations of three and 
seven days when the grandson is born or when he 
attains his first year are hereby forbidden and 
henceforth the people should not have any more 
difficulties about bringing up daughters. If, in 
spite of this, the poor are unable to bring up their 
female children, they must carry them to the 
orphanage or give them to other families.” 2»

  64 History of the Child 
General Ki of the province of Koang Tong insti- 
tuted an investigation to find out what the actual 
conditions were in his provinces, and after receiving 
his reports, issued a proclamation in which he said: 
“Tam convinced that in the province of Koang 
Tong the custom of drowning and suffocating the 
girl babies is common and that the rich as well as 
the poor are guilty. The poor pretend that, not 
having sufficient means of existence, they are not 
able to bring up their female children, while the 
tich declare that there is no object in bringing up 
children that occupy a purely ornamental position 
in the household.” 
( Ki then goes on to philosophize on the enormity 
of the crime and the folly of these reasons. Never, 
perhaps, did any single individual in China devote 
himself with more energy to trying to eradicate 
this evil than did Ki, both by verbal castigation of 
those who were guilty of the crime and by appeal- 
ing to the sympathies of the inhabitants of his 
province. He distributed copies of the works of 
Ouang Ouan. He sent out advice and instructions 
to his subordinates that infanticide must be pre- 
vented; he enlisted the nobles and educated people 
in this fight and reiterated that those who were 
guilty of the crime would be seized, judged, and 
punished with sixty blows and a year’s banishment 
as the law directed. Throughout the province 
his efforts were regarded as extremely interesting, 
his proclamations as delightful literature, and there 
was no decrease in the number of murders

  Establishment of Orphanages 65 
(In 1845 the Emperor Tao Kang himself pub- 
lished an edict condemning the practice and de- 
claring that the extreme punishment permitted by 
the law would be meted out to the guilty. The 
edict had no effect. ) 
(In 1848 another endeavour was made by the 
chief magistrate of Canton, acting on the initia- 
tive of Ki, to eliminate the evil in that particular 
city, but neither in Canton or in the province of 
Koang Tong was there a cessation of the evil for 
eighteen years afterward. The Emperor Kong Tche 
listed both Canton and the province as among the 
places where infanticide was most common.) 
(During the reign of Hien Fong, 1851-1862, little 
progress was made. In many parts of China during 
the following reign, that of Tong Tche, 1862-1875, 
attempts were made to check the evil) 
‘During the minority of the Emperor the two 
Boies: Regents issued a proclamation in which 
they appealed to the ‘‘nobles and rich of all vil- 
lages to contribute for the erection of orphanages 
where there might be received abandoned child- 
ren so that the poor will not be able to justify their 
abominable practice on the ground of poverty.” 
The reign of Koang Siu began in 1875, and was 
marked with vigorous proclamations and warnings 
to the people to take their children to the orphan 
asylums that were being —— rather than 
to throw them into the river.‘ )

(of the conditions as they exist in modern times, 
travellers and writers are of one accord—infanti- 
cide is horribly prevalent. The conditions vary 
with different localities. 
(“In Fuhkien province,” says Williams, ‘‘espe- 
cially in the department of Chang Chau, in- ’ 
“‘Foochow—' The Prefect and the local magistrates have within 
the last few days issued a stringent proclamation against the 
practice of female infanticide. It provides that all parents guilty 
of destroying a child shall be punished according to the law 
against the destruction of descendants, which, it seems, provides 
sixty blows and a year’s imprisonment, as the proper punish- 
ment. A midwife, who destroys a child, is to be punished by 
strangulation. Neighbours who know of the commission, and 
do not report it, are to be punished as accessories to murder; 
and the Tepo are to be punished in the same way. A vigorous 
execution of this proclamation would do much to remedy the 
evil; but it remains to be seen whether the proclamation is more 
than a periodical fulmination, with the probability that it is not.’

“From the Foochow Herald. ‘The following proclamation 
was recently issued by the Prefect of Foochow, and is, we under- 
stand, extensively circulated throughout the city and suburban 
districts. ) 
( “‘“Weng, acting Prefect of Foochow, issues an emphatic 
proclamation. 
“««Tt has been found that the drowning of newly-born female 
infants is of frequent occurrence in places under this prefectural 
jurisdiction. As a reason for this cruel and outrageous behaviour 
towards their children, the poor allege that they are without 
the means to support them; the rich that they dread the expense 
of providing them with dowries. The Acting Prefect has re- 
peatedly issued prohibitory proclamations since assuming charge 
of this post, and has also instructed the magistrates to arrest 
delinquents. It has been reported of late that in the neighbour- 
hood of Shang Kan, under the jurisdiction of the Min magistrate, 
the practice of female infanticide still exists; it is further reported

fanticide prevails to a greater extent than in 
any other part of the Empire yet examined. Mr. 
Abeel extended his inquiries to forty different 
towns and villages lying in the first, and found 
that the percentage was between seventy and 
eighty down to ten, giving an average of about 
  
that in one spot over ten infants have been found drowned, so 
that there is every reason to believe that this vicious practice 
extends to other places too. It is the Prefect’s duty to draw up 
the most stringent supervisory regulations in order to the re- 
claiming of people from this rooted habit. The Prefect has 
instructed the magistrates to act in this spirit, and has now to 
issue this proclamation peremptorily forbiddng the practice. ) 
ae “Wherefore now know ye all, gentry, elders, scholars, civil 
and military, and all persons whatsoever in this prefecture, that 
it is your duty to act one and all of you in accordance with the 
spirit of the following Regulations, and exercise a watch upon 
each other. If any families are found drowning their female 
infants, it will assuredly be at once reported to the magistrates, 
who will severely punish the act in accordance (with law). If 
any persons favour or connive at this practice and do not act 
upon the instructions, on the discovery or report of a case the 
hundred-men, neighbours, and relatives will be held equally 
accountable. No leniency will be shown. Tremble at this! 
Obey this! Do not disobey! A special proclamation.”’ 7) 
“Rules relating to midwives: 
c ‘Female infanticide must always be practiced immediately 
r birth, and is generally committed by the midwife, but even 
if the parents do it themselves, the midwife must know. The 
leading gentry and the hundred-men are hereby charged hence- 
forward to take notice of midwives in their respective villages 
who may dare to assist in drowning female infants. The leading 
gentry, the hundred-men, members of families, and neighbours 
are authorized to ascertain and send in the names of such mid- 
wives, and apply for their punishment as accomplices.’ )

forty per cent. of all girls born in those places as 
being murdered. In Chang Chau, out of seventeen 
towns, the proportion lies between one fourth 
and three tenths in some places, occasionally 
rising to one third, and in others sinking to one 
fifth, making an average of one fourth put to 
death. In other departments of the province the 
practice is confessed, but the proportion thought 
by intelligent natives to be less, since there is less 
poverty and fewer people than formerly.” ) S 
“Infanticide, which until now has gone unpun- 
ished,” says Dr. Lauterer, “‘is practised especially 
in Pekin and Fuhkien. A large per cent. of female 
infants meet with an unnatural death because of 
their parents’ poverty or their niggardliness. The 
unfortunates are simply cast into the nearest 
stream and the corpse left until the morning when 
the government’s wagon collects them, or they are 
exposed in the open where, not being protected 
from the cold, they soon perish. Lately a decree 
has been made to prohibit it.’ 
{ ‘The province of Fuhkien,” says Douglas, ‘‘is 
that in which this crime most obtains. Inquiries 
show that in many districts as large a portion as 
one fourth of the female children born are destroyed 
at birth. At Pekin, on the other hand, it cannot 
be said to exist at all. But in this as in so many 
social offences in China, the sword of the law, which 
is alone capable of putting down crime, is allowed 
to hang like a rusty weapon on the wall.) It is

with all the impressiveness that could be desired,

from without it will continue, in China, to yield

(“The custom of infanticide,” wrote Professor 
Krausse, ‘‘is one which has obtained in many parts 
of China for ages. It does not, as a rule, take the 
form of actual murder, but consists rather in assist- 
ing the laws of Nature. Thus an infant will be 
neglected and permitted to perish, or if it sicken, 
will be put aside and allowed to take its chance.”’? )

= ous people named Koropok-guru, who 
lived in conelike huts built over holes 
dug in the earth and who were exterminated by 
the Ainu people. The latter were in turn con- 
quered by the race that we speak of today as the 
Japanese; these last settlers coming to the islands 
of Japan from somewhere in the north of Cen- 
tral Asia, while a second stream of South Asian 
immigrants were drifted to Japan by the Japan 
current.) 
In the Kojiki, or ‘Records of Ancient Matters,” 
dictated by Hide-no-are and completed in a.p. 
711 or 712, we have a record of the mythology, 
manners, language, and the traditional history 
of Japan; this “‘history’’ purports to give the act- 
ual story of Japan from the year 660 B.c., when 
the first Emperor Jimmu, ‘‘having subdued and 
pacified the savage deities and extirpated the un- 
71 a first inhabitants of Japan were a numer-

submissive people, dwelt at the palace of Kashi- 
wabara.” Modern Japanese scholars as well as 
Western scholars are inclined to say that there is 
really no authentic history before A.D. 461 but as 
a picture of the customs of early Japan, the Kojiki 
is still the only authentic document that we have. 
Inazo Nitobe, in dividing the history of his 
country into periods, groups the legendary age 
and all that went before the political reforms of 
the seventh century as the first period, under the 
name of the ‘‘ancient period.” 
These ancient people, the mythical people of 
the Kojiki, had passed through a genuine Bronze 
Age and had in general attained a high level of 
barbaric skill. Of their many curious customs, both 
in the Kojiki and in the equally important Ni- 
hongi or ‘‘Chronicles of Japan,” prominent notice 
is made of the “‘parturition house””—‘‘one-roomed 
but without windows, which a woman was sup- 
posed to build and ae into for the purpose of 
being delivered unseen,’ " Here i is evidence that th the 
the head of the house. » 
Even up to recent times in the island of Ha- 
chijo the custom survived according to Ernest 
Satow, who visited this island in 1878. 
(‘In Hachijo,” wrote Mr. Satow, ‘‘women, when 
about to become mothers, were formerly driven 
out to the huts on the mountainside, and accord- 
ing to the accounts of native writers, left to shift 
for themselves, the result not unfrequently being

the death of the new-born infant, or if it survived 
the rude circumstances under which it first saw the 
light, the seeds of disease were sown which clung 
to it throughout its after life. The rule of non- 
intercourse was so strictly enforced that the 
woman was not allowed to leave the hut even to 
visit her own parents at the point of death, and 
besides the injurious effects that this solitary 
confinement must have had on the wives them- 
selves, their prolonged absence was a serious loss 
to households where there were elder children and 
large establishments to be superintended. The 
rigour of the custom was so far relaxed in modern 
times that the huts were no longer built on the 
hills, but were constructed inside the homestead. 
It was a subject of wonder to people from other 
parts of Japan that the senseless practice should 
still be kept up, and its abolition was often recom- 
mended, but the administration of the Shoguns 
was not animated by a reforming spirit, and it 
remained for the government of the Mikado to 
exhort the islanders to abandon this and the pre- 
viously mentioned custom. They are therefore 
no longer sanctioned by official authority and the 
force of social opinion against them is increasing, 
so that before long these relics of ancient ceremo- 
nial religion will in all probability have disappeared 
from the group of islands.” / 
As with most early histories there is little de- 
scription of custom or manners in either the Kojiki 
or the Nihongi, but we gather what the general 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  74 History of the Child 
attitude was toward children from the fact that 
the conception of marriage was probably limited 
to cohabitation, this condition lasting until well 
on into the Middle Ages, ‘ cohabitation being often 
secret at first, but afterward acknowledged. 
When the latter conditions had come to prevail, 
the young man, instead of going to his mistress 
under the cover of the night, brought her back 
publicly to his parents’ home, and that was the 
beginning of his own home. } 
Little is there in the Kojiki about the care of 
children but the harshness toward women about to 
have children, as shown in the frequent reference 
to the parturition houses, shows that unless they 
were children of royalty they were left to what- 
ever care their mothers might be able to bestow 
on them. 
In the account of the making of Japan by the 
two Heavenly Deities, known as the Izani-gi-no- 
kami and Izana-mi-no-kami, the Man Who In- 
vites and the Female Who Invites, it is stated 
that their first child was not retained. 
“This child,” says the legend,” after retailing 
the events that led up to its birth, ‘‘they placed 
in a boat of reeds and let it float away. Next they 
gave birth to the island of Aha. This is not reck- 
oned among their children.” 
( Among the gods, therefore, children were re- 
jected or accepted without ceremony, and with 
? Brinkley, vol. i., p. 61. 
? Kojiki, introduction, p. xl. 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
  
Sex Inequality 75 
such an attitude of rejection or acceptance de- 
picted as the normal condition among the deities, 
it may easily be imagined what was the attitude 
of the ordinary beings who modelled their conduct 
on that of the deities. 
It is told of the first Emperor Jimmu, that, 
meeting a group of seven maidens, he invited one 
of them to become a wife of his, and on her accept- 
ance the sovereign passed the night at her house. 
This constituted the only marriage ceremony that 
the times knew. As far as the woman was con- 
cerned, all that the new condition meant was that 
she was liable to receive a visit at any time from 
her new lord and master, but on his side there 
was no obligation, no duty of fidelity, and he was 
free to form as many similar unions as fancy 
dictated. ) 
The children were brought up by the mother 
and one household of a man might be in absolute 
ignorance of another. Mistress, wife, and con- 
cubine were on the same footing and could be 
discarded at any moment. When the Deity of 
Eight Thousand Spears, attired in his favourite 
courting costume, is about to go forth and search 
for a ‘‘better wife” he boldly announces that :)

  76 History of the Child 
| To this the Chief Empress, Her Augustness the 
Forward Princess, to whom the frank statement 
is made, plaintively replies: 
“Thou ... indeed, being a man, probably 
hast on the various island-headlands that thou 
seest and on every beach-headland that thou 
lookest on, a wife like the young herbs. But I, 
alas! being a woman have no man except thee; 
I have no spouse except thee!’’! 
(What became of the children in the cases of 
conjugal separation does not appear, a statement 
that is made by no less a Japanese authority than 
Chamberlain.? In only one instance is there any 
reference made to the fate of a child that had been 
deserted, but this is an unusual case, where the 
father had violated the rules of the parturition 
house, with the result that the mother disappears, 
leaving the father to take care of the child. He 
pledged himself to look after it until the day of 
his death but the sister of the child’s mother was 
first invoked to act as nurse. 
The result of this system of family life was that 
where the children of different mothers but of 
the same father discovered one another’s presence 
there were feuds and much fighting, especially as 
it was the children of the latest affection who were 
generally the recipients of his favour to the chagrin 
and anger of the less favoured children and fami- 
lies. Marriages between half-brothers and half- 
* Kojikt, section xxv. 
2 Chamberlain, Introduction, p. xl.
-P-A-G-E-117
  Consanguineous Marriages 77 
sisters were another result of the system, the only 
restriction on marriages of any kind being that 
children_of the same mother should not marry. 
Sons of the same father were thus incited to be 
enemies rather than brothers, in the accepted 
sense, and the annals of the civil wars are replete 
with tales of treachery and ambition and show 
almost an entire absence of natural affection. 
The fact that the children had no claim on the 
love and the protection of the father and that 
their mother was condemned under the ancient 
system to the function of a mere animal, is cited 
by Brinkley as the reason for this cruelty and 
treachery.* 
This was the position of the child in the society 
that is depicted in the Kojiki and the Nihongi, 
although the latter, written about forty years 
after the Kojiki (A.D. 720), and under the influ- 
ence of the Chinese, is more apt to depict the 
conditions that sprang up with the spreading 
Chinese culture. 
The fourth century brought to Japan a know- 
ledge of Chinese classics, and Chinese morals, and 
in 552 A.D., there came a still greater change when 
the Buddhistic religion was introduced through a 
copy of the scripture and an image of Buddha 
being sent to the Yamato Court by the govern- 
ment of one of the Korean kingdoms. Unsuccess- 
ful preachments there had been by unofficial 
missionaries before this, but the arrival of the

Korean ambassador served to bring to the atten- 
tion of the government the new religion in a man- 
ner calculated to arouse interest in its doctrines. 
( Whatever may be the defects of Shintoism, 
human sacrifice never seems really to have been 
part of its practice,* and to this fact, with the in- 
creasing regard for life that came with civiliza- 
tion, is undoubtedly due the little emphasis given 
to infanticide among the Japanese. Another in- 
fluence, undoubtedly, and this is said to be the 
“best point of Shinto,’’? is that the people were 
taught that they themselves were sons and daugh- 
ters of the gods, a belief apt to save the killing 
of surplus members of society in a time of economic 
stress. 
( According to the Nihongi, human sacrifice was 
put an end to in Japan in the year A.D. 3: 
“Tenth month, fifth day: Yamato-hiko, the Mi- 
kado’s younger brother by the mother’s side, died. 
‘Eleventh month, second day: Yamato-hiko 
was buried at Tsukizaka in Musa. Thereupon 
his personal attendants were assembled, and were 
all buried alive upright in the precinct of the tomb. 
For several days they died not, but wept and wailed 
day and night. At last they died and rotted. 
Dogs and crows gathered and ate them.) 
(‘The Emperor, hearing the sound of their weep- 
ing and wailing, was grieved at heart, and com- 
manded his high officers, saying:

    Substitution in Sacrifice 79 
Gs ‘It is a very painful thing to force these whom 
one has loved in life to follow himin death. Though 
it be an ancient custom, why follow it if it is bad? 
From this time forward, take counsel so as to put 
a stop to the following of the dead.’ 
“A.D. 3, seventh month, sixth day: The Em- 
press Hibasuhime no Mikoto died. Sometime 
before the burial the Emperor commanded his 
ministers, saying: 
“We have already recognized that the practice 
of following the dead is not good. What should 
now be done in performing this burial?’ ) 
“Thereupon Nomi no Sukune came forward and 
said: 
Ke ‘It is not good to bury living men upright at the 
tumulus of a prince. How can such a practice be 
handed down to posterity? I beg leave to propose 
an expedient which I will submit to your Majesty.’ 
“So he sent messengers to summon up from the 
land of Idzumo a hundred men of the clay-workers 
Be. He himself directed the men of the clay- 
workers Be to take clay and form therewith shapes 
of men, horses, and various objects, which he 
presented to the Emperor, saying: 
““Fenceforward, let it be the law for future 
ages to substitute things of clay for living men, 
and to set them up at tumuli.’

‘““Thy expedient hath greatly pleased our 
heart.’ )

“So the things of clay were first set up at the 
tomb of Hibasuhime no Mikoto. And a name 
was given to those clay objects. They were 
called hani-wa or ‘clay rings.’ 
“Then a decree was issued, saying: 
““*Henceforth these clay figures must be set up 
at tumuli; let no men be harmed.’ 
“The Emperor bountifully rewarded Nomi 
no Sukune for this service, and also appointed 
him to the official charge of the clay-workers Be. 
His original title was therefore changed, and he 
was called Hashi no Omi. This was how it came 
to pass that the Hashi no Muraji superintended 
the burials of Emperors.’’* 
The date ascribed to this incident cannot be 
depended on. ‘‘Chinese accounts speak of the 
custom of human sacrifices at the burial of a 
sovereign as in full force in Japan so late as A.D. 
247,” says Aston. Probably all the events of 
this part of Japanese history are very much ante- 
dated. But of the substantial accuracy of the 
narrative there can be no doubt. Some of these 
clay figures (known as tsuchi-ningio) are still 
in existence, and may be seen in the British 
Museum, where they constitute the chief treasure 
of the Gowland collection. The Uyeno Museum 
in Tokio also possessed specimens, both of men 
and horses. None, however, remain in situ at the 
tombs. The hani-wa (clay-rings), cylinders which

can hardly have all been surmounted by figures. 
But they are of the same workmanship and of the 
same date, and no doubt some of them are the 
pedestals of images, the above-ground part of 
which has been destroyed by the weather or by 
accident. | 
“A similar substitution of straw or wooden 
images for living men took place in China in an- 
cient times, though by a curious inversion of ideas, 
the former practice is described as leading to the 
latter.’’* 
(While neither the lion or the tiger ever troubled 
Japan and her most carnivorous and destructive 
animals have been wolves, tradition has ascribed 
the sacrifice of human beings in Japan to the desire 
to placate the god of wild animals. The victim 
was always a girl, and from the earliest ages the 
manner of selecting her was to affix to the roof of 
a house a bow and arrow. When the householder 
arose in the morning and discovered what was 
accepted as a divine intimation, the eldest daugh- 
ter of the family was buried alive, it being supposed 
that her flesh served as a meal for the deity. 
Later the priests of Buddha found a more profit- 
able method of disposing of these girls by selling 
them as slaves; thereby following out the funda- 
mental tenet of the Buddhistic religion, which is

the sanctity of human life, and at the same time 
increasing their wealth. Some writers refer to this 
practice as being a sacrifice to an animal in the 
service of Shakamuni, which would have made it 
a Buddhistic rite, but the idea is scoffed at by 
Brinkley.t Even up to recent times it is said 
the habit of sacrificing human beings in order to 
make the foundation of any great work more stable 
was common. The corpses of two human beings 
were said to be under the scarps ‘‘of the futile 
forts hurriedly erected for defence of Yedo [Tokio] 
in the interval between Commodore Perry’s first 
and second coming.’’? ) 
In the Tokugawa period, extending from about 
1615 to 1860, two and a half centuries, Japan was 
a hermit nation distinguished for its peaceful 
character. Yet its population for one hundred 
years remained almost stationary. By some 
authorities, this has been explained not only on 
the ground of many famines and devastating 
diseases but the common practice of abortion and 
the fact that the Samurai considered it disgraceful 
to marry until they were thirty, and equally 
disgraceful to raise a family of more than three 
children? 
< ‘Among the lower classes it was not common to 
rear all the children born, especially if girls came 
too frequently.” Also, ‘‘While there was hardly 
in the whole country a hospital in our sense of

the term, there were in the large cities physicians 
famous for their skill in preventing the birth of 
living children. They kept private establishments 
to accommodate calculating patrons. All author- 
ities agreed that sexual morality in the large cities 
was at a very low ebb among all classes, while 
luxury and effeminacy prevailed among people 
high in birth and wealth.’’* 
As a picture of what the people were driven to 
and a terrible example of what attitude famine 
may lead parents to take toward their children, 
there is no more important document than the 
statement of Shirakawa Rakuo, distinguished as 
the Minister of Finance of the Eleventh Shogun, 
Iyenari. The trace of cannibalism in semi- 
civilized peoples is easier to understand after the 
fearful famine in the third year of Temmei (1783). ) 
“A trustworthy man,” says Rakuo,? ‘‘who had 
travelled in this district [northern part of country], 
told me that in a village which had previously 
contained 800 houses there were only thirty left, 
the inhabitants of the rest all having died. Hav- 
ing entered a village in which the houses seemed 
to be larger and more numerous than usual, he 
proposed to rest there for the night. He soon 
discovered, however, that not a single house was 
inhabited, but in all the houses he saw bones and

skulls scattered about the floor.)/ As he went on 
he saw innumerable bones and skulls by the road- 
side. He met a man leading a pack-horse on the 
road, who said that he could survive without eating 
the flesh of human beings as he was supported by 
a rich uncle. In some places even those who 
abandoned themselves to eating human flesh 
could not find food enough to live. Great num- 
bers starved to death. The price paid for a dog 
was 500 sen, sometimes even as high as 800 sen, 
a rat 50 sen. A rare work of art found no pur- 
chasers and could not be exchanged for a go of 
rice. Ifa person died he was of course eaten by 
the survivors. Those who died of starvation, 
however, could not be eaten, because their flesh 
decayed so soon. Some people, therefore, killed 
those who were certain to starve and put the flesh 
into brine so as to keep it fora longtime. Among 
other people there was a farmer who went to his 
neighbour and said, ‘My wife and one of my sons 
have already died from want of food. My re- 
maining son is certain to die within a few days, 
so I wish to kill him while his flesh is still eatable, 
but being his father, I do not dare to raise the 
sword against him, so I beg you to kill the boy for 
me.’ The neighbour agreed to do this, but stipu- 
lated that he should get a part of the flesh as a 
reward for his service. This was agreed to and the 
neighbour at once killed the boy. As soon as the 
deed was done, the farmer, who stood by, struck 
his neighbour with a sword and killed him, saying
-P-A-G-E-127
      Reforms of Yoshimune 85 
that he ‘was very glad to avenge his son and at 
the same time have double the quantity of food.’ ’”) 
( Up to the close of the seventeenth century, 
feudal legislation was very harsh, one of the worst 
laws of ancient times in force until that time being 
that by which children were punished for the 
crime of their parents.* If a man or a woman 
had been sentenced to be crucified or burnt and 
had male children above fifteen years of age, 
those children were similarly executed, and if they 
were under that age they were given over to a 
telative to be reared until they reached the age 
of fifteen, when they were banished. When the 
criminal parent was condemned to the ordinary 
hanging or beheading it was still within the discre- 
tion of the judge to condemn the male children 
to be executed or exiled. The female children, 
while exempt from the capital punishment, were 
liable to be sold as slaves. 
(In 1721, during the reign of the enlightened 
Yoshimune, who was Shogun from 1716 to 1746, 
there were many reforms, and it was then enacted 
that for all crimes, even those punishable with 
crucifixion and exposure of the head, only the 
criminal himself must be punished. In the case 
of the most heinous of all crimes, according to 
Japanese standards, parricide or the murder of a 
teacher, a special tribunal was declared to be the 
only place where it could be decided whether the 
children and grandchildren should be implicated.)

  86 History of the Child 
(Interesting too is the fact that this leniency ex- 
tended to the farmers and merchants only, the 
Samurai not being included, it being assumed that 
the crime of a person of nobility and education 
was a more serious matter than a crime by a person 
less fortunate—a theory of justice that has never 
taken root in the minds of the Occidentals except 
among romancers. 
\ From the time, early in the seventeenth century, 
when the governing power of Japan fell into the 
hands of the Buddhist Tokugawa family, through 
Iyeyasu, the head of the house, there was an en- 
deavour to check the sale of children. No less 
than eight enactments were issued between 1624. 
and 1734 declaring the sale of human beings 
punishable by death.) 
( Progress naturally was slow when the conditions 
were so flagrant that there were open offices where 
the sales and purchase of children were effected.* 
In 1649 an absurd compromise was attempted 
when a law was passed declaring it was lawful to 
sell a child, providing that the consent of the child 
was obtained. There was an attempt to regulate, 
without abolishing, slavery in the law of 1655, 
which declared that in a dispute between an em- 
ployer and the employed, the employer, if found 
to be in the wrong, might be imprisoned or meted 
out any punishment that the employed might 
suggest. It is safe to add that the administrative 
criminal machinery was not in the hands of the

proletariat, nor was there any suffrage that 
threatened to put the employed in the position 
of judge. ) 
( It was during this period that the law was passed 
allowing the parent to have his son or daughter 
imprisoned, a just cause being assumed. A father 
had the right to punish his son, but the son had 
the right to appeal to a magistrate for a review of 
the sentence; but ‘“‘costs” of the appeal were 
dangerous inasmuch as if the son lost he had to 
suffer whatever penalty his father might dole out 
to him. The Occidental mind will not appreciate 
so readily the attempts of the Tokugawas, begin- 
ning 1627, to regulate the social evil, one of their 
early laws depriving employers of all authority 
“to retain the services of a female for immoral 
purposes outside the appointed quarter.”’) 
(Modern writers on Japan lay stress on the affec- 
tion of the Japanese for their children, and yet 
“during the famine of 1905 many girls who had 
been sold by the suffering parents were redeemed 
by the Christians.”* This sacrifice of the children 
to the welfare of the parents is traceable to the 
influence of Confucius. To the same source may 
be ascribed the fact that, though in ancient times 
the female sex was prominent in Japan, after the 
introduction of Confucianism the Samurai con- 
sidered it beneath him to even converse with his 
wife and children.? ‘‘Neither God nor the ladies

inspired any enthusiasm in the Samurai’s heart,” 
says Professor Chamberlain. For is it not written 
by the great moralist Karbara Ekken in the Owna 
Dargaku, ‘‘It was the custom of the ancients, on 
the birth of a female child, to let it lie on the floor 
for the space of three days. Even in this may 
be seen the likening of the man to heaven and of 
the woman to earth.’’* 
Only a few years ago a child, both of whose 
parents had died of cholera, was on the point of 
being buried alive by neighbours when it was 
rescued.? ‘‘Certain parts of Japan have been no- 
torious from of old for this practice,’”’ says Gulick. 
“In Toas the evil was so rampant that a society 
for its prevention has been in existence many 
years. It helps support children of poor parents 
who might be tempted to dispose of them crimi- 
nally.” 
On the other hand, this word from Professor 
Goodrich, who as a member of the faculty of the 
Imperial College pictures a nation far from indiffer- 
ent to the welfare of the child: 
“Ever since the beginning of that indefinite 
period which we call ‘modern times’ the birth of a 
child has always been an occasion for rejoicing. 
To be sure, in Japan that joy was very much 
greater when it was a boy baby; yet the Japanese 
have never displayed such intense dislike to girl 
babies as have the Chinese. One great reason

for this was that the population of Japan was not 
so dense as it isin China. It was easier to provide 
for children, and therefore there was no incentive 
to put girl babies out of the way. I am sorry to 
say that very lately, since the Russo-Japanese 
War (1904-5), when the Japanese people are 
almost crushed by the weight of taxes to provide 
money with which to pay war expenses and to keep 
up army and navy, the number of cases of female 
infanticide is increasing alarmingly.”’*

who in the fourth millennial period B.c. were- 
already a cultured and civilized people.) 
(Recent excavations have changed the entire 
historical attack. Instead of beginning with the 
Homeric Age as an age of legend, ‘“‘civilization 
may now be traced beyond the Mycenzan epoch, 
through the different stages of Aigean culture 
back into the Neolithic Age.”' In Egypt we 
can now go back before the pyramid builders to 
the earliest dynastic kings, even to Neolithic 
Egyptians of whom there are no written records. 
Back of the known civilization of Assyria and 
Babylon, there has been discovered an even older 
civilization.) 
(“On the northern and eastern confines of the 
Babylonian culture-system, new nations pass 
within our ken; Vannic men of Armenia, ruled by 
powerful kings; Kassites of the Zagros, whose 
language seems to contain elements which if really 
Aryan are probably the oldest known monuments 
of Indo-European speech (c. 1600 B.C.); strange 
tongued Elamites, also, akin neither to Iranian 
nor Semite. Nor does it seem to us remarkable 
that we should read the trilingual proclamations 
of Darius Hystaspis to his peoples in their origi- 
nal tongues, although an eighteenth century philo- 
sopher would have tegarded the prospect of our

ras!’’? )

  92 History of the Child 
( Recent excavations have established the fact 
that the earliest known civilization was in what 
afterwards came to be known as Mesopotamia, 
between the Euphrates and the Tigris, and that 
groups of people living in cities and calling them- 
selves, in the lower section of the country, the 
Sumerians, and in the upper section, the Akkadi- 
ans, dwelt in civilized state until they were con- 
quered by the Semitic peoples. The Semites in 
their conquest of the Greeks, as we now know, 
took from the conquered the culture of the race 
that was physically weaker, as indeed the Gauls 
did from the Romans. 
In government, law, literature, and art the Su- 
merians were the superior people, and though the 
Semites improved on their models, the impulse, 
says King, came from the Sumerians. ' It is now 
known that Hammurabi’s Code of Laws, which 
influenced in so marked a degree the Mosaic 
legislation, was of Sumerian origin, and_the later 
religions and mythological literature from which 
the Hebrews borrowed so freely, was also of 
Sumerian origin. 
( Even with the excavations that are now going 
on and the discoveries that are being made almost 
daily, our evidence is still too scanty and imper- 
fect, the gaps in it are too numerous, ? as Professor 
Sayce says, apropos of the Babylonian religion, to 
make it possible for us to discuss with any definite-

ness the attitude of these first civilized peoples to- 
ward children. Years will pass before the tablets 
already in the museums will have been deciphered, 
to say nothing of those that are being dug out now. 
A library of 30,000 tablets was discovered by M.de 
Srazec at Telloh in Northern Babylonia, at Nippur 
in the great temple of Bel, and five times as many 
were discovered later by the American excavators. 
Once the British Museum was the sole repository of 
these treasures, containing everything from busi- 
ness contracts to prayers to the gods, but now 
they are in the Louvre, the Berlin Museum, the 
Museum of Constantinople, the University of 
Pennsylvania, and even in private collections. ) 
(: ‘From these Semitic conquerors of the Sumerians, 
however, there came the first civilization and the 
first humanization, for in this rich valley with its 
abundance of water and its rich soil, the Nomads 
became an agricultural people; there was plenty for 
all, and the germ of human tolerance that the world 
was to show later toward the child, was there in 
that long ago pre-Semitic civilization of Babylonia. ) 
(Traces there are, however, of an earlier attitude, 
when the first-born was sacrificed. Speaking of a 
Babylonian text, that he believed established the 
fact that there were sacrifices of the first-born 
among the Sumerians, Professor Sayce said: ” 
(“‘My interpretation of the text has been dis- 
puted, but it still appears to me to be the sole 
legitimate one. The text is bilingual, in both - 
Sumerian and Semitic, and therefore probably goes 4 
?
-P-A-G-E-136
  94 History of the Child 
back to Sumerian times. Literally rendered, it 
is as follows: ‘Let the abgal proclaim: the off- 
spring who raises his head among men, the off- 
spring for his life he must give; the head of his 
head among men, the offspring for the head of the 
man he must give, the neck of the offspring for 
the neck of the man he must give, the breast of the 
offspring for the breast of the man he must give.’” 
It is difficult to attach any other meaning to this 
than that which makes it refer to the sacrifice of 
children. * 
_Further corroboration of this belief of Professor 
Sayce was furnished by the recently dug up Stele 
of the Vultures, now in the Louvre. Here there 
is a representation of a wicker cage, filled with 
captives who are waiting to be put to death by 
the god Ningirsu, who holds in his hand the 
heraldic emblem of the city of Lagash. The Stele 
of the Vultures records the triumph of the King 
of Lagash, the great Eannatum, over the men of 
Umma who are undoubtedly the captives and 
are about to be sacrificed.2 These few ex- 
amples of human sacrifice indicate, however, that 
the practice had disappeared at an early date, but, 
as we shall see, it did not entirely disappear, or 
rather reappeared_among the Semites of Palestine 
at a later period.

      Reforms of Urukagina 95 
( More positive knowledge, however, we have of 
the Sumerian laws, laws it should be remembered 
that tell of a civilization 1000 years before the 
Chinese. \ 
(That there was a sense of justice in Sumer 
and Akkad long before the period of Hammurabi, 
is evident from the inscriptions found at Tello 
by Gerzec. Inscriptions of the year 3500 B.C., 
according to Cuq, and about the year 2800, accord- 
ing to King, show that Hammurabi was indebted 
to the reform king, Urukagina, for many of his 
laws. Urukagina declared that the people had 
rights, and even went so far as to say that if the 
king bought the property of a subject, he must pay 
forit. Wehave many tablets telling of the wonder- 
ful things that he did, but the one reform which 
indicates that he had a regard for the family, and 
consequently, there was probably more care for 
children, is that provision of his laws which 
deals with divorce. ) 
Cin telling of his reforms in these inscriptions, 
Urukagina records the fact that under the old 
régime, if a man put away his wife, he paid the 
patesi five shekels of silver and gave one to the 
grand vizir. 
(Undoubtedly in the beginning, the object of 
these fees was to prevent the nobles, and through 
them by force of example, the plain people, from 
putting away their wives too easily. In other 
words there was a desire to hold together the old 
Sumerian family. In the course of time, however, 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
    96 History of the Child 
this became merely a bribe, for as the economic 
conditions improved, the money became not so 
much a deterrent as a bribe. One of the things 
that Urukagina did was to abolish the fees of 
divorce, and to attempt to stamp out practices that 
were growing up.. 
. Tablets of the time of Urukagina and his prede- 
cessor, Lugalanda, translated by M. de Genouillac, 
give some indication of what the family condi- 
tion was, although we still have to guess as to 
what was the real attitude toward children. Wo- 
men were important; they could hold property 
and they were protected in their property rights 
by law. This in itself might indicate that there 
were no such primeval practices as exposing or 
drowning female children. Among these tablets 
of Tello, is a series telling what provision was made 
for the women who were attached to the Temple of 
Bau, the goddess to whom the great ruler prays, as: 
“|. . The one that grantest life unto the 
land.) .. 
( “Thou art the Queen, the mother that founded 
Lagash.”* In these tablets the name of each 
woman is followed with the number of infants be- 
longing to her family, and their sex. In all, two 
hundred and twenty-nine infants are enumerated, 
of which ninety-seven are boys and one hundred 
and thirty-two, girls. Five hundred and fifty-two 
women are named, but before coming to a con- 
clusion as to the percentage this shows of children

    Pensions for Mothers! 97 
to mothers, it is well, as de Genouillac points out, * 
to remember that among these five hundred and 
fifty-two women there were many young girls. 
Some idea of the size of the Sumerian family 
may be obtained from the fact that the number of 
infants charged to a single mother is seldom more 
than four. Once the number seven occurs, but 
this is in connection with the wife of the king, 
and two of these children would seem to have 
been adopted.) 
(“The education of a large number of infants, ” 
concluded de Genouillac, ‘‘was encouraged by . 
the pension for mothers.’”’ Here indeed was 
progress!—at a time when there was nothing 
but barbarism everywhere else in the world. 
(Gc is interesting to note in these same tablets 
the fact that the wife of the king or the patesi 
was of great importance, for all documents signed 
by Lugalanda bear the name of his wife, Barnam- 
tarra, and those under Urukagina have the signa- 
ture of his wife, Sagsag. It is more than likely 
too, that the service mentioned above as being 
for the Temple of Bau, was for the goddess’s 
representative, the Queen Sagsag. Another 
tablet, in which are set forth the expenses of the 
servants who were apparently more attached to 
the queen, speaks of thirty infants to fifty-seven 
women,” and in this and other tablets the fre- 
quent reference to the orphans who were being

taken care of, shows that there was provision for 
the infant whose immediate protectors had passed 
(In the Imperial Museum at Constantinople two 
tablets show that parents were free to sell their 
children and that these sales were frequent matters 
of legal adjudication four centuries before Ham- 
murabi. Tablet No. 830, excavated at Tello, is 
imperfect, but there is enough of it to show us 
that in the month of the féte of the goddess Bau, 
the daughter of Ab-ba-gi-na was sold by her father, 
and the sale was confirmed and properly sworn to 
and then registered. In Tablet No.925, we have the 
sale of a daughter to a cook, by a widow who was 
probably in hard straits. The daughter tries to 
break the contract and the mother stands by her, 
but the cook brings two witnesses who prove that 
the sale took place and was a proper one; as a result 
of this attempted fraud, the master then inflicts 
punishment on the slave. >) 
As a further evidence of the humanity of the 
Sumerians, we have the fact that, like the Egyp- 
tians, they had a god who presided over the ac- 
couchements, a god who corresponded in some ways 
to the Hera of the Greeks and the Juno of the Lat- 
ins, but who had other and more kindly functions, 
and was there to ameliorate pain and apparently to 
protect the young. Among the Greeks and Ro- 
mans the young were never thought of except as the 
property of adults, whose interest always came

first.. In fact, among the Babylonians and Egyp- 
“tians, there was this essential difference, that the 
goddess was really a midwife. Among the Sumeri- 
ans, she was known as Belitile, and was after- 
wards identified with Mama, the goddess of 
the young; and in two texts translated by P. 
Dhorme,* the two are referred to as one. Later 
on the two goddesses were absorbed by the all- 
powerful Istar. ) 
It was in December, 1901, that M. J. de Morgan, 
Director-General of the expedition sent out by the 
French Government, while excavating the acropo- 
lis of Susa, found three large fragments of a block 
of black diorite among the debris. When fitted 
together these three fragments formed a stele eight 
feet high, on the upper end of the front side of 
which was a bas-relief showing the sun-god, 
Shamash, presenting the Code of Laws to the king, 
Hammurabi. 
Under this bas-relief was the longest cuneiform 
Semitic inscription yet recovered, having sixteen 
columns of text of which four and a half formed the 
prologue. On the reverse of the stele there were 
twenty-eight columns, the entire inscription being 
estimated by Johns to contain ‘‘forty-nine columns 
four thousand lines, and eight thousand words.”

Hammurabi, identified by Assyriologists as the 
Amraphael of Genesis xiv., 1, was the sixth King 
of the dynasty of Babylon, reigning over fifty- 
five years, about 2250 B.c., and the first king to 
consolidate the Semitic empire, making Babylon 
the capital." 
There are two periods in the history of human- 
ity: one when the morals make the laws, and one 
when the laws change the morals. The Code of 
Hammurabi, the oldest known code in the world, 
belongs to the second period.? ) 
(While it appears from the prologue and epilogue 
of the Code that Hammurabi was deeply devoted 
to religion and was, in addition to being king, a 
pious, God-fearing man, one who destroyed his 
enemies North and South, the Code is strictly 
devoted to civil and secular affairs. Nevertheless, 
scarcely anything is known of the laws of the time 
dealing with crimes, nothing having been dis- 
covered to show how murder or theft was treated. ) 
Hammurabi’s Code is undoubtedly a compi- 
lation and, while he enacted fresh laws, he built 
for the most part on the foundations of other men. 
In the Sumerian days that preceded these Semitic 
kings, of whom Hammurabi, Sargon I., and Lugal- 
zaggisi were the greatest, there were codes of laws

      Hammurabis’ Code 101 
on which Hammurabi doubtless built. The atti- 
tude taken toward children in this period is indi- 
cated in extracts from the series called ana ittisu, 
the seven tablets of the series giving the following 
seven laws: ) 
C1 If a son has said to his father, ‘You are not 
my father,’ he may brand him, lay fetters upon 
him, and sell him. 
“TI. Ifa son has said to his mother, ‘You are 
not my mother,’ one shall brand his forehead, 
drive him out of the city, and make him go out of 
the house. 
“TIT. Ifa father has said to his son, ‘You are 
not my son,’ he shall leave house and yard. 
“TV. Ifa mother has said to her son, ‘You are 
not my son,’ he shall leave house and property. 
“V. If a wife hates her husband and has said, 
“You are not my husband,’ one shall throw her into 
the river. 
“VI. If a husband has said to his wife. ‘You 
are not my wife,’ he shall pay half a mina of 
s'lver. 
“VII. Ifa man has hired a slave and he dies, is 
lost, has fled, has been incapacitated, or has fallen 
sick, he shall measure out 10 ka of corn per diem as 
his wages.” 
(From this it will be observed that if the son 
repudiates his parent, real or adoptive, he meets

with a swift and heavy punishment. (On the other 
hand, a father and mother have the power to drive 
the child out without any ceremony whatever. 
That such laws were the result of the disposition 
of foundling children is without question. We will 
see later that the Roman Empire in its endeavour 
to save the lives of children, was continually at- 
tempting legislative reforms for the purpose of 
giving men and women incentive to protect the 
helpless infant that had been deserted by its own 
parents. 
Adoption was an ancient institution, and the 
rights of the man who adopted the infant were 
protected in order that he might be paid for the 
trouble and expense of his charge. 
The adoption of children in the Code of Ham- 
murabi is the subject of much minute regulation. 
In the Code the endeavour to protect the father 
who picks up a child, is shown in paragraphs 185, 
186, 187 and 188: 
“785. Ifaman take in his name a young child 
as a son and rear him, one may not bring claim for 
that adopted son. 
“186. Ifaman take a young child as a son, and, 
when he takes him, he is rebellious toward his 
father and mother (who have adopted him), that 
adopted son shall return to the house of his 
father. 
“187. One may not bring claim for the son of

“188. Ifan artisan take a son for adoption and 
teach him his handicraft, one may not bring claim 
for him.’”*) 
Coming down to a later period, we may see the 
influence of other peoples on the Babylonians in 
the Assyrian Doomsday Book or Liber Censualis, 
copied from the cuneiform tablets of the seventh 
century, B.C.? Sixty-eight families are enumerated 
in these tablets, and to these sixty-eight hus- 
bands there are allotted ninety-four wives. Sev- 
enty-four sons are mentioned and only twenty-six 
daughters, a proportion that is extremely suspi- 
cious. That there was no such slaughter of the 
females as we find in other countries, is shown by 
the fact that in some of the families enumerated 
there were as many as three daughters to one son, 
but the majority of the families were without 
female children and had one or two sons, an even- 
ness of distribution which would lead one to surmise 
that the people of the district of Harran, where this 
census was taken, were regulating the birthrate 
themselves. ) 
(Of this period too, is the story of Sargon the 
younger—a legend that is interesting not alone 
because of its similarity to that of Moses, but 
because it shows that this section of the country

had also fallen into the ways of the rest of the 
world. Here, at the time of the legend, it was a 
common thing for a child to run the risks of expo- 
sure and death. 
As an indication of the conditions a thousand 
years later, we may take the certificate of adoption 
cited by Dr. Rogers, of the time of King Kuri- 
galzu who reigned in Babylon from about 1390 
B.C. to 1375. 
“Tna-Uruk-rishat, daughter of (mu) shallim, 
had no daughter and therefore she adopted Etirtu, 
daughter of Ninib-mushallim, as her daughter. 
Seven shekels of gold she gave. She may give her 
to a husband, she may appoint her a temple slave, 
but she may not make her a servant. If she does 
make her a servant, Etirtu shall go to her father’s 
) house. As long as Ina-Uruk-rishat lives, Etirtu 
shall pay her reverence. When Ina-Uruk-rishat 
dies, Etirtu, as her daughter, shall offer the water 
libation. If Ina-Uruk-rishat should say, ‘Thou art 
not my daughter,’ she shall lose the gold which she 
has paid. If Etirtu should say, ‘Thou art not 
my mother,’ she shall become a servant. There 
shall no claim be made. Before Ellil, Ninib, Nus- 
ku, and_King Kurigalzu they have made oath 
together. 
“Before Damkum, her uncle on the mother’s 
side. Before Rabasha-Ninib. Before Ellil-ibni, 
son of Ellil-ishu. Before Etel-pi-Azagshug, son 
of Amel-Marduk; before Rish-Marduk, son of

Ninib-mushallim. The fifth day of Shebat, the 
twenty-first year of Kurigalzu, king of the world.’’* 
‘From another point of view we may also under- 
stand the Babylonian morality. As a character- 
istic it is interesting to note “that the general 
modesty of the Babylonian art, in the matter of 
clothes, is very marked,” says Ward, ‘‘we never 
see any display of Phallism.”? That the influence 
and importance of the women had much to do with 
the character of these people is undoubtedly true. 
They were a truly remarkable people of whom 
we are yet to learn a great deal. Future excava- 
tions may reveal much, but up to now ‘‘the abun- 
dant literature of Babylon,” says Dussaud, ‘‘does 
not offer a single example of human sacrifice and 
yet one has the right to suppose that it was 
common among them.” 3 )

Caste System of Egypt 107 
the Egyptians, just as we find among the Sumerians 
and the Akkadians, who were contemporaneous in 
civilization about four and five thousand years 
before Christ, that the attitude toward children is 
settled, and apparently in the child’s favour; 
for aside from occasional sacrificial offerings in 
which the child is on a par at least with the slave 
or the servant about to be sacrificed, there is no 
evidence of the endeavour to do away with the 
children on the scale that we find in ancient Greece 
and Rome and later in India and China. ) 
(Had there been, however, less positive division 
of castes in Egypt, the infants of the higher class 
would not have been as well treated. The lives 
of the military and priestly castes were almost 
sacred’; it was on them that the king relied for 
support, and the rest of the population, whether 
nominally free or slave, were foreordained to a life 
of incessant toil. Maspero quotes from the Sellier 
Papyrus, a satiric poem, which goes to show the 
conditions in the earliest time among these work- 
men whose lives of hardship were only varied by 
the irregular visits of the tax-gatherers. These 
visits, though dreaded, were never prepared for and 
were always the occasions of several days of pro- 
testations, threats, beating, cries of pain from the 
tax-payers, lamentations from the women and child- 
ren, the gathering up of the tax, the departure of the 
tax-collectors and then the calm with the resump- 
tion of labour until the next visit of the collectors.)

  108 History of the Child 
( “T have never seen a blacksmith on an embassy,” 
so runs the complaint of the proletariat 3000 years 
before Christ,—‘‘nor a smelter sent on a mission— 
but what I have seen is the metal worker at his 
toil,—at the mouth of the furnace of his forge,— 
his fingers as rugged as the crocodile, and stink- 
ing more than fish-spawn. The artisan of any 
kind who handles the chisel, does not employ so 
much movement as he who handles the hoe; 
but for him his fields are the timber, his business is 
the metal, and at night when the other is free,— 
he, he works with his hands over and above what 
he has already done, for at night, he works at 
home by the lamp. The stone-cutter who seeks 
his living by working in all kinds of durable stone, 
when at last he has earned something, and his two 
arms are worn out, he stops; but if at sunrise he 
remain sitting, his legs are tied to his back. The 
barber who shaves until the evening, when he falls 
to and eats, it is without sitting down—while 
running from street to street to seek custom; 
if he is constant (at work) his two arms fill his belly, 
as the bee eats in proportion toits toil. Shall I 
tell thee of the mason—how he endures misery? 
Exposed to all the winds—while he builds without 
any garment but a belt—and while the bunch of 
lotus-flowers (which is fixed) on the (completed) 
houses—is still far out of his reach—his two arms 
are worn out with work; his provisions are placed 
higgledy piggledy amongst his refuse, he consumes 
himself, for he has no other bread than his fingers,   
-P-A-G-E-155
  Misery of Egyptian Poor 109 
and he becomes wearied all at once.) (He is much 
and dreadfully exhausted—for there is (always) a 
block (to be dragged) in this or that building, a 
a block of ten cubits by six,—there is (always) 
a block (to be dragged) in this or that month (as 
far as the) scaffolding poles (to which is fixed) the 
bunch of lotus-flowers on the (completed) houses. 
When the work is quite finished, if he has bread, 
he returns home, and his children have been beaten 
unmercifully (during his absence). The weaver 
within doors is worse off there than a woman; 
squatting, his knees against his chest,—he does 
not breathe. If during the day he slackens weav- 
ing, he is bound fast to the lotuses of the lake; 
and it is by giving bread to the doorkeeper, that 
the latter permits him to see the light. The dyer, 
his fingers reeking—and their smell is that of fish- 
spawn ;—his two eyes are oppressed with fatigue, 
his hand does not stop,—and, as he spends his time 
in cutting out rags—he has a hatred of garments. 
The shoemaker is very unfortunate; he moans 
ceaselessly, his health is the health of the spawning 
fish, and he gnaws the leather. The baker makes 
dough, subjects the loaves to the fire; while 
his head is inside the oven, his son holds him by 
the legs; if he slips from the hands of his son, he 
falls there into the flames. ’’*) 
(The matriarchal tendencies of the Egyptian 
Government also account for the fact that children, 
1G. Maspero, Dawn of Civilization, pp. 311-314.
-P-A-G-E-156
110 History of the Child 
as arule, were not only allowed to live but were 
better treated than they were among other peoples. 
Even the first Egyptians, although semi-savages 
like those inhabiting Africa and America, were 
different in their attitude toward women to such 
an extent that the Greeks were led into believing 
that in Egypt the woman was supreme. The 
husband entered the house of the wife instead of 
the wife entering his* and this led to the child- 
ren recognizing the parental relation through the 
mother alone. ) , 
(To this matriarchal tendency may also be attrib- 
uted the activity of Maskonit, the god who ap- 
peared at the child’s cradle at the very moment of 
its birth, and Raninit, who gave him his name and 
saw that he was properly nursed. With two such 
deities in the list of gods, obviously the creations 
of women and hardly those of semi-savage men, 
it was evident that the women were using their best 
supernatural means to protect childhood. Signi- 
ficant, too, may be the fact that these protecting 
deities were goddesses, for, as may be seen from the 
story of the ill-fated prince,*—there was always a 
chance that either the crocodile, the serpent, or 
the dog, might get the infant. In the possibility 
of death by either of the three, there was the mem- 
ory of days when mothers were either less careful 
or had not much authority.)

          Such knowledge as we have of the kings of the 
Fifth Dynasty indicates that they were builders, 
but it was during this dynasty, in the reignof Tetka- 
Ra (about 3366 B.c.), that what has been described 
as the oldest book in the world, the Precepts of Ptah- 
Hotep, was written. In this remarkable document 
the first care of the author after a stirring picture 
of old age, for it is evident that Ptah-Hotep wrote 
in his old age, is to enjoin those who read, that by 
following in the ways of the fathers, the children 
will prosper. All through there are, as M. Chabas 
pointed out, evidences that it furnished the basis 
for many of the later injunctions of the Hebrews 
in regard to filial obedience: 
C‘Bring up your son in obedience.’’ 
“The son who receives the word of his father 
will live to be old because of it.” 
“Beloved of God is obedience; disobedience is 
hated by God.” 
The later injunction of Ecclesiastes, ix., 9, is 
found in the 18th rubric: 
“If you are wise take good care of your house; 
love your wife and cherish her.”’? 
( The husband and wife are frequently represented 
together at this time, and their attitude toward 
one another is most affectionate. In the group of 
M’Ayptah we see the Priest of Ptah in what to our 
modern understanding is a real family group, not 
unlike those the photographer of the congested

districts in large cities is frequently called on to 
perpetuate. On the left of the Priest is his wife, 
Ha’tshepest, while on his right is his grown-up 
daughter. Two smaller figures represent a second 
daughter and the grandson of M’Ayptah.t The 
prominence of women here in relations so affection- 
ate is unlike anything that we find in other ancient 
nations, and argues the presence of a spirit different 
from that of most nations at the same stage of 
culture. ) 
(In the time of the Old Kingdom (from the Third 
to the Sixth Dynasty), a man had but one wife, who 
was the mother of his heirs, was in every respect 
his equal, and shared authority with the father 
over the children. The natural line of inheritance 
was through the eldest daughter, and the closest 
ties were through the mother.” 
| In the Adventures of Sanehat, a story written ap- 
parently at the time of Amenemhat I., the founder 
of the Twelfth Dynasty, Sanehat’s description 
of his reception in the court of the king, when 
the royal children were brought forth to join in the 
general celebration, would also indicate that there 
was no desire to show any preference to either 
sex.3)

Dynasty‘ is the belief of Messrs. King and Hall,

who point to the excavations at Thebes, in the 
precinct of the funerary temple of Nebhapet- 
Ra-Mentuhetep and about the central pyramid 
which commemorated his memory. There were 
buried a number of ladies of his harim, who were 
without doubt killed and buried at the same time, 
in order that they might accompany their royal 
master to his new abiding place. With each of 
these ladies there was buried a little waxen human 
figure placed in a little coffin, the image being 
intended to take the place of the slave of the lady 
of the harim. As the ladies were not royal, real 
slaves were not killed for them, which shows that 
the idea of sacrifice even then had contracted until 
it was restricted to personages of the highest rank. \ 
According to Porphyry, who quotes a work of 
Manetheo on Antiquity and Piety,* the law per- 
mitting or ordering the sacrifice of men was 
repealed by Amosis. Amosis, it is said, ordered 
that waxen images be substituted. The excava- 
tors have found not only the wax images but those 
of later days, when wood and glazed faience as 
well as stone were used, the growing humanity 
of the age seeking in this way to progress from 
the primitive indifference to the death of others.” >

  114 History of the Child 
Twentieth, or from about 2800 to IIO B.C.), 
children were ill-treated or suffered from any of the 
usual methods of getting rid of surplus progeny. 
It is true that the monuments are more given to 
warlike exploits than to revelations of social man- 
ners, but the conditions in early Egypt all seem to 
point to the fact that, living in a land of plenty, 
they had early passed beyond the stage when the 
life of the child was the first sacrifice to the god 
of necessity. 
‘In this Connection it must be said that the 
only direct evidence we have from the ancients 
is that of Diodorus Siculus, a contemporary of 
Cesar, who visited Egypt in the course of his 
thirty years’ preparation for his historical work. 
In what he says of the punishment of those who 
killed their children, he is citing the ancient Egyp- 
tians before they came under the influence of the 
Greeks and Romans: / 
(“Parents that killed their children, were not 
to die, but were forced for three days and nights 
together to hug them continually in their arms, 
and had a guard all the while over them, to see 
they did it; for they thought it not fit that they 
should die, who gave life to their children; but 
rather that men should be deterred from such 
attempts by a punishment that seemed attended 
with sorrow and repentance.”’?) 
In another section of his work, Diodorus is

(“The Egyptian priests only marry one wife, 
but all others may have as many wives as they 
please; and all are bound to bring up as many 
children as they can, for the further increase of 
the inhabitants, which tends much to the well- 
being either of a city or country. None of the 
sons are ever reputed bastards, though they be 
begotten of a bond maid, for they conceive that 
the father only begets the child, and that the 
mother contributes nothing but place and nourish- 
ment. And they call trees that bear fruit, males, 
and those that bear none, females; contrary to 
what the Grecians name them. They bring up 
their children with very little cost and are sparing, 
upon that account, to admiration: for they pro- 
vide them broth, made of any mean and poor 
stuff that may be easily had; and feed those that 
are of strength able to eat it, with the pith of bul- 
rushes, roasted in the embers, and with roots and 
herbs got in the fens; sometimes raw, and some- 
times boiled; and at other times fried and boiled. 
Most of their children go barefooted and naked, 
the climate isso warm and temperate. It costs not 
the parent to bring up a child to man’s estate, 
above twenty drachmas; which is the chief reason 
why Egypt is so populous, and excels all other 
places in magnificent structures. The priests 
instruct the youth in two sorts of learning; that 
which they call sacred, and other, which is more

common and ordinary. In arithmetic and geo- 
metry, they keep them a long time: for in this 
regard, as the river every year changes the face 
of the soil, the neighbouring inhabitants are at 
great difference among themselves concerning the 
boundaries of their land, which cannot be easily 
ane but by the help of geometry.”’* 
\Strabo also speaks of the Egyptians as excep- 
tions, when he refers to the parents’ power of life 
and death over children: and others assert that 
while they were cruel toward the new-born of the 
Hebrews, they were kind toward their own.?) 
( The early development of the belief in a here- 
after, as it showed itself in the unusual care of the 
body of the deceased, also affected, without doubt, 
the attitude of the Egyptians toward their own 
progeny, if it did not affect it toward that of others; 
in dealing with the primitive and early peoples we 
must always realize that we can understand them 
only by the way in which they dealt with their own. 
Their kindness to their own, argued an advanced 
civilization—to test their degree of civilization by 
the attitude they took to the children of slaves or 
the children of servants, is to ask more of them 
than we can ask of our contemporaries. / 
In the desire to look after the future life, the 
Egyptians were exceptional, as their embalming 
showed. They lived in a salubrious country, they 
boasted that they were ‘‘the healthiest of mor-

tals,”"* and so great was their horror that any one 
should mutilate the human form, that the paras- 
chistes (mapusytoctjs) who made the necessary inci- 
sions in the dead when a body was to be embalmed, 
became an object of execration as soon as his job 
was over. According to Diodorus Siculus, he was 
always assaulted by his own assistants, stones being 
thrown at him with such violence that he had to 
take to his heels in order to escape with his life.? 
(Perhaps it isa far cry, but it seems as though a 
people who made such preparations as the Egyp- 
tians did for the dead, would have been chary of 
causing the death of those who had sprung from 
their own loins. For the care of the dead was not 
confined to the noble and the wealthy alone—the 
lower classes were also affected by the desire for a 
proper kind of funeral, to the extent that enterpris- 
ing people procured an old empty tomb, enlarged 
it, and let places out init. Hither then, came the 
fisherman, the peasant, and the dancing girl— 
in death they were the equal of the king, for they 
were buried with ceremony, their bodies were 
placed where the tomb equipment might be by 
them—and thus with the king, the noble, and the 
wealthy, they waited the time that was to be.3 ) 
(Among such a people it is hard to think that 
the death of even a child was treated lightly.)

  118 History of the Child 
‘ Of the Egyptians after the conquest of Alex- 
ander we must write as of the Greeks; and in the 
matter of children it is important to note that 
a recently discovered papyrus, written in Greek 
in the year I B.c., shows how completely the for- 
eign point of view had been absorbed in a land 
in which four thousand years yielded up not a 
single evidence of the assassination of children) 
\The papyrus is a letter from Illarion, whose 
home is at Oxyrhynchus, and who evidently has 
‘ gone to Alexandria with other workmen. He has 
apparently not sent his wife many messages of af- 
fection despite the fact that she is about to have 
a child. When the other workmen are going to 
return home, he plans to stay in Alexandria, but 
he promises to send home some of his wages. The 
part of the letter that is most interesting to us is 
his injunction that if the child that is expected 
should turn out to be a female, it should be cast 
out. In the salutation, Illarion refers to his wife 
as his sister, marriages between brother and sister 
having been common in Egypt, and the term being 
one of endearment. The letter follows:) 
(‘‘Illarion to Alis his sister, many Greetings, 
and to mother Berous and Apollonarion. Know 
that I am still even now at Alexandria. I urge 
and entreat you to be careful of the child, and if I 
receive wages soon I will send it to you. When 
you bear offspring, if it is a male let it be, if a female 
expose it. »

toward the child, there could be no more 
illuminating study than that of the habits of 
our own ancestry, the so-called Aryan primitives. 
Whether the cradle of the race was in India and 
spread from there throughout Europe, or whether 
the original habitat was Central Europe, the fact 
remains that the earliest records of the civiliza- 
tion of all of the races from the Indians and 
Aryans in Asia to the Celts, Teutons, Hellenes, 
Goths, and Italians indicate that they were a 
pastoral rather than an agricultural people and 
that while the family was the unit, the father was 
undoubtedly the supreme power that later marked 
the pater familias in Rome. ) 
(The mere absence of fish-hooks in the archz- 
ological remains and the fact that the Aryans 
120 ( |" an examination of the attitude of early man

were for a long time a fish-hating race (the word 
fish-eater used as a term of opprobrium by Her- 
odotus, there being no mention of eating fish in 
the Vedas and only occasionally in Homer) go to 
show how limited was the food of that race. It 
is only as the various branches of the race devel- 
oped that they came to know the art of fishing 
and the value of fish, a fact that is shown in the 
lack of a common name for fish in the Aryan 
tongues. The age of Homer was really the begin- 
ning of the Iron Age of the Aryan people, the culture 
of Italy and Hellas resulting from a ‘‘lengthened 
process of historical evolution” stimulated and 
developed by contact with the high culture of the 
Semites, which again was derived from the proto- 
Babylonian people.*) 
_Up to this time in the struggle for existence of 
these semi-savages everything was sacrificed for 
war, and infanticide and human sacrifice were 
practised, there being reason to believe that even 
cannibalism was practised in Britain, if not by the 
Celts certainly by the Iberians.) 
(Early Greek myths reveal a condition of society 
little different from that which the missionaries in 
recent years have found at Dahomey. Children 
were killed when they were not wanted; wives 
were bought and sold. The practice of breaking 
a bottle over the bow of a vessel is a survival of a 
savage practice of the vikings of binding a human 
being to the prow when the war galley was

launched in order that the keel might be sprinkled 
with sacrificial blood.) 
(Recent philological research corrected by arche- 
ological discovery has established the fact that the 
members of the Aryan race up to the time of the 
Homeric legends were nomad herdsmen who had 
domesticated the dog and wandered over the plains 
of Europe in wagons drawn by oxen. They knew 
how to fashion canoes out of the trunks of trees 
but with the exception of native copper they were 
ignorant of metals. It is extremely doubtful if 
they practised any agriculture. They collected 
and pounded in stone mortars the seed of some 
wild cereal, either spelt or barley. They recog- 
nized the association of marriage but they were 
polygamous. They practised human sacrifice and 
they retained after birth only those children that 
they could conveniently rear, or those male children 
who were regarded as necessary for the increase of 
the fighting forces of the tribe.) 
/( Upon the Dasyas, the dark-skinned, flat-nosed 
people who originally inhabited India, the Aryans 
triumphantly descended, eventually driving the 
Dasyas out of their lands. From the Rig Vedas 
we learn the nature of the Aryan conqueror. He 
was a warrior, but he was a prayerful warrior 
who prayed for health, a defensive armour, and a 
comfortable dwelling. There were frequent sacri- 
fices to the gods and at all of the sacrifices inter- 
esting philosophical and sphagiological discussions 
took place. In ‘his prayers he prayed for racy

and healthy children, but he always prayed for 
boys and never for girls. His children were part 
of his scheme of wealth; they were his body and 
soul." , 
(The two great epics, the Mahabharata and the 
Ramayana, are the two sources of information 
on this period. Written down when the art of 
writing became known about the year 800 B.C., 
these books mirror the life of the people for cen- 
turies further back. The attitude toward chil- 
dren can only be gleaned from such statements as 
that Bhishma, one of the heroes of the Mahabha- 
rata, was the eighth son of his father, and the first 
to be allowed to live. The deaths of the previous 
seven are explained on the ground that his father 
Shantanu, the King of Hastinapur, was married to 
Ganga, the river goddess, who had consented to be 
the wife of the King on condition that, no matter 
what he might see her do, he would ask no ques- 
tions. When she, however, having drowned the 
seven, attempted to drown the eighth son, he was 
obliged to cry “‘enough,” thereby saving the son 
but losing his wife, who departed declaring that the 
previous seven sons had been seven of the deities, 
condemned to a fresh life for some venial sin, and 
had been released by her from their punishment by 
an early death. 
(With such a ‘story recited as semi-religious doc- 
trine it can easily be seen why there grew up early 
the feeling that there was no crime in taking the

  124 History of the Child 
lives of those children who were regarded as un- 
necessary. 
Bhishma takes a vow not to marry, in accord- 
ance with which he refuses the offer of Amva who 
revenges herself when she is born a second time, 
as Chikandini, the daughter of a great king. The 
epic opens up another view of the early Aryan 
attitude when it is stated that Chikandini, al- 
though a daughter, is allowed to live; but in order 
to accomplish this her mother hides her sex for 
twenty-one years.*) 
( In the Sankhayana-Grihya-Sutra there is a 
long description of the ceremony of the Pum- 
savana (the ceremony to secure the birth of a 
male child) which with its earnest prayer for a 
male child, not only at the time of coition but 
again with much ceremony in the third month, 
shows that the female child was doomed to a most 
unwelcome reception at the very best. As we 
shall see later, these ceremonies were bound to 
produce, in the course of time, not only the prac- 
tice of killing female infants without remorse 
but even the disgusting ceremonies that marked 
female infanticide in some places.? ) 
The feeling of these people at all times about 
women is best expressed in the words of the ordi- 
nance of Manu: “Women are born to bear chil- 
dren.’ The female child that escaped death had

therefore a sharply defined life before it. It is a 
question, as Professor Gottheil suggests, as to 
whether it is a degeneracy that brings about the 
death of these infants in view of the life they would 
be obliged to lead. Girls were betrothed at three 
or four years of age and at seven had gone through 
the ceremony of marriage to boys of whom they 
knew nothing, and when those boys died they re- 
mained virgin widows. At one time it was possible 
for them to be taken to their boy husbands’ 
homes and in some instances they became mothers 
before they were eleven. Not until March 19, 
1891, was a law passed in India prohibiting cohabi- 
tation before twelve.* 
Vatsyayana, an ancient Hindu sage, author of 
the Kama-sutra, in which are given rules for the 
domestic life of the Hindus, mirrors the point of 
view of his time, about the first century, A.D. 
According to Vatsyayana parents were to show to 
their children all indulgence and freedom—until 
they were five. From five to sixteen they were to 
be instructed in the fourteen sciences and sixty- 
four arts, after which time the lord of creation was 
enjoined to become a householder.? 
COf this early period there is plenty of evidence 
of human sacrifice which, even when it did not 
consist entirely of children, led to the slaughter of 
children. ‘‘There is no evidence,” as Professor 
Wilson says, ‘‘that the practice ever prevailed to 
t Sir Monier-Williams, Brahmanism and Hinduism, p. 387.

  126 History of the Child 
the extent to which it spread through most of the 
ancient nations, or partook in general of the same 
character. They were in the main sacrifices of an 
expiatory nature performed in fear and intended 
to deprecate the anger of the gods.”’*) 
Monier-Williams suggests that it is possible that 
human sacrifice was at one time part of the 
Brahmanical system and adduces the story of 
Hariskandra and Sunahsepa as an evidence of 
that practice.? In this legend, Hariskandra, being 
childless, prays to Varuna to grant him a son, vow- 
ing to sacrifice him to the god. A son is born but 
the father does not keep his word, and when the 
son reaches the age of discretion he refuses to be- 
come a victim. From a starving Brahman he 
purchases a son for one hundred cows, but this 
victim escapes by being adopted by the priest 
Visvamitra who is a royal sage. 
In the Purushamedha, or the section of the 
Satapatha-Brahmana dealing with the human sac- 
tifice, a large number of men and women are bound 
to eleven sacrificial posts, and after the necessary 
tites have been performed on them, they are set 
free and eleven animals are killed instead. That 
in times previous to this adoption human beings 
had been sacrificed, there is no doubt.) 
\ Despite all that can be said in favour of the 
Buddhistic religion and the reforms that it wrought,

  Buddhism and Infanticide 127 
it is not possible to find that it made any change 
in the attitude of the Hindus toward their chil- 
dren or the practices of the day as did the religion 
of Christ and later the religion of Mohammed, one 
of which sanctified the child, while the other 
expressly forbade infanticide. Laying down the 
law that life was a period of suffering and humility, 
the Buddhistic religion still declared that Nirwana 
was not obtainable by those under seven, so that 
the life of the child did not take on any increased 
value under the new religion of Gautama.) 
(it was natural that with no forceful check on 
infanticide contained in the new religion, the 
primitive idea so well planted should spread and 
become stronger rather than diminish. It is 
therefore not surprising that in the Manava- 
dharma-castra ascribed by Burnell’ to the period 
between the year I A.D. to the year 500, the daugh- 
ter is placed very low in the scale of things human: 
“*184—Children, old people, the poor and sick, 
are to be known [to be] lords of the sky; an elder 
brother is equal to a father; a wife and son are 
one s own body.) 
¢°185—And one’s own servants are one’s own 
ganlow: a daughter is the chief miserable object. 
Therefore offended by these, one should always 
bear it without heat.’’?

Alexander that it attracted the attention even of

that Greek in his march of conquest through the 
country, is evident in the records that he brought 
back. ) 
Q. Curtius Rufus relates,* that on entering the 
kingdom of Sophytes, Alexander was astonished 
at the wisdom of the laws of this barbarian. 
According to Curtius and Diodorus, Sophytes was 
governor of a territory west of the Hyphasis while 
according to Arrian it lay along the banks of the 
Hydaspes. 
| “Here,” says Curtius, ‘‘they do not acknow- 
ledge and rear children according to the will of the 
parents, but as the officers entrusted with the 
medical inspection of infants may direct, for if 
they have remarked anything deformed or defec- 
tive in the limbs of a child they order it to be killed. 
In contracting marriages they do not seek an 
alliance with high birth, but make their choice 
by the looks, for beauty in the children is a quality 
highly appreciated. ’’? 
“These, ’’ said Diodorus Siculus, ‘‘were governed 
by laws in the highest degree salutary, for while 
in other respects their political system was one to 
admire, beauty was held among them in the highest 
estimation. For this reason a discrimination 
between the children born to them is made at the 
stage of infancy, when those that are perfect in 
their limbs and features, and have constitutions 
which promise a combination of strength and 
beauty, are allowed to be reared, while those that

    Beauty Among Sophytes 129 
have any bodily defect are condemned to be 
destroyed as not worth rearing. They make their 
marriages also in accordance with this principle, 
for in selecting a bride they care nothing whether 
she has a dowry and a handsome fortune besides, 
but look only to her beauty and other advantages 
of the outward person.’’*) 
(‘A very singular usage,’’ says Strabo, ‘“‘is re- 
lated of the high estimation in which the inhabi- 
tants of Cathaie hold the quality of beauty, which 
they extend to horses and dogs. According to 
Onesicritus, they elect the handsomest person as 
king. The child [selected], two months after birth, 
undergoes a public inspection, and is examined. 
They determine whether it has the amount of 
beauty required by law, and whether it is worthy 
to be permitted to live. The presiding magistrate 
then pronounces whether it is to be allowed to 
live, or whether it is to be put to death. ”? 
(As far as I have been able to discover, the first 
attempt made by the British Government and 
perhaps the first organized effort in the Eastern 
world to put an end to the murder of female chil- 
dren was in 1789 when the British resident officer 
of Benares, Jonathan Duncan, afterwards Governor 
of Bombay, authenticated from the confessions of 
a race called the Rajekoomars the existence of 
the custom. Sir John Shore, afterwards a witness

: Teignmouth, in an address to the Royal Society 
of Bengal in 1794 described how, after many 
suggestions, it was decided that the only way that 
the Rajekoomars could be moved was by getting 
them to sign an ‘“‘engagement”’ binding them to 
desist ‘‘in future from the barbarous practice of 
causing the death of their female children.” 
Inasmuch as that engagement was the beginning 
of the work in India and was afterwards used as a 
model for other engagements and reveals a curious 
attitude of mind on both sides, I reprint it in full: 
“Whereas it hath become known to the Govern- 
ment of the Honourable English East India 
Company, that we, the tribe of Rajekoomars, do 
not suffer our female children to live; and whereas 
this is a great crime, as mentioned.in the Brehma 
Bywant Pooran, where it is said that killing even 
a Fetus is as criminal as killing a Brahman, and 
that for killing a female, or woman, the punish- 
ment is to suffer in the nerk, or hell, called Kat 
Shootul, for as many years as there are hairs on 
that female’s body, and that afterwards that person 
shall be born again, and successively become a 
leper and be afflicted with the Jukhima; and 
whereas the British Government in India, whose 
subjects we are, have an utter detestation of such 
murderous practices, and we do ourselves acknow- 
ledge, that although customary among us they are 
highly sinful, we do therefore hereby agree not to 
commit any longer such detestable acts; and any 
among us (which God forbid) who shall be here-

after guilty thereof, or shall not bring up and 
get our daughters married to the best of our 
abilities among those of our caste, shall be expelled 
from our tribe, and shall neither eat, nor keep 
society, with us, besides suffering hereafter the 
punishments denounced in the above Pooran and 
Shafter. We have therefore entered into this 
agreement») 
“Dated the 17th of December, 1789.” 
€On May 27, 1805, Colonel Alexander Walker, 
the resident at Baroda, called the attention of the 
government at Bombay to the conditions in Guz- 
erat, and the government authorized him to go 
ahead and use such measures as he deemed wise 
to suppress infanticide, sending him a copy of the 
engagement of Duncan as a suggestion of lines that 
might be profitably employed.? ) 
(it was while in the course of his investigations 
and work in suppressing the practice that Colonel 
Walker heard first from the Hindus the suppos- 
edly divine origin of the practice of putting female 
children to death. It was the supposedly divine 
origin and the fact that they acted within the ob- 
servance of their religious duties that gave pro- 
tection against interference from civil authorities. 
The Jharejas, a tribe among whom Walker made 
his investigations, informed him that the origin of

  132 History of the Child 
the practice of infanticide came about through the 
fact that a powerful Raja of their caste, who had a 
daughter of singular beauty and accomplishments, 
desired his Rajgor or family Brahmin to affiance 
her to a prince of desert and rank equal to her 
own.* 
The Rajgor, after much travelling, returned to 
the Raja and informed him that he was not able to 
find any one to meet the proper requirements. 
The Raja was so dejected over this that, according 
to the story, he finally consented to the Rajgor’s 
putting his daughter to death as the only means out 
of the difficulty; and from that time on, according 
to the Jharejas, female infanticide was practised 
throughout the land. 2, 
There is much frankness in this explanation 
inasmuch as it was the difficulty of marrying their 
daughters in a way they considered properly that 
encouraged the practice. There is no doubt there 
had been a persistent warfare in the formative 
periods of the tribes, and when the warlike condi- 
tions made it impossible to marry the daughters 
advantageously, the daughters become a burden 
with the result that the practice of infanticide 
sprang up. z

               pal families, of placing their daughters in nunner- 
ies, might be traced to the same motives that led 
the Jharejas to put theirs to death; and both have 
originated in the desire of diminishing the cares 
and expense attending a numerous family.”*) 
(That the practice, no matter how deeply rooted 
in the tribe, still leaves the decision with the father, 
is shown from the following explanation of putting 
the child to death: ) 
(‘When the wives of the Jhareja are delivered 
of daughters, the women who may be with the 
mother repair to the oldest man in the house; this 
person desires them to go to him who is the father 
of the infant, and do as he directs. On this the 
women go to the father, who desires them to do as 
is customary, and so to inform the mother. The 
women then repair to the mother, and tell her to 
act in conformity to their usages. The mother

\ The heads of the tribes were consulted. Many 
of them declared that the women and children were 
well treated and pointed out the fact that the 
Hindu religion has always protected the female 
sex from violence and that it was unlawful to put 
a woman to death for any offence whatsoever. In 
support of this they quote the following Sloke verse,

(Among these people the following story was told 
as giving the origin of the sacrifices of human 
beings: 
“A certain Raja, having built a spacious and 
beautiful tank, found every effort to fill it with 
water impracticable. 
“This greatly distressed the Raja, and having in 
vain exerted every expedient of devotion and labour 
the Raja at last vowed to his particular deity the 
sacrifice of his own child, provided this precious 
offering was accepted by the grant of his prayer. 
“Accordingly the Raja directed one of his 
children to be placed in the centre of the tank, on 
which the deity instantly gave an undeniable 
testimony of his assent and gratification; the tank 
immediately filled with fine water, and the child 
was sacrificed in being drowned.”' )

that founded Judaism, Christianity, and Is- 
lamism—its attitude will be better understood if we 
approach it through the tribes whose religions and 
humanitarian ideas were eventually to become 
the religions and humanitarian ideas of the civilized 
world. ) 
( The beginning of the nation of Israel was the 
result of the frequent immigration into Palestine of 
Semites who fused with the aborigines and formed 
the Phoenician or Canaanitish people. From the 
time of Lugalzaggisi (about 4000 B.c.) there were 
successive Babylonian immigrations also, and from 
1500 B. C. onward there were added to this mixture 
the Aramean tribes that had previously inhabited 
the highlands between the Mesopotamian Valley 
and the Mediterranean Sea. Originally pure

nomads, the Israelites after settling in Canaan 
became excellent agriculturists,‘ and there devel- 
oped the worship of Yahweh—‘‘the worship of no 
other god contributing to the sum of humanity’s 
ethical ideas and spiritual conceptions a tithe of 
the value of that contributed by the worshippers 
of Yahweh.’’? 
( These nomadic Semites when they settled in 
Palestine about 1000 B.c., after years of wandering, 
had many of the characteristics of a highly culti- 
vated people but they also had the habits of the 
nomadic people that had originally come out of 
Arabia. Many too were the lapses into the ways 
of primitive people during the four hundred years 
of their wandering after their life in Goshen. 
Cif, as has been said, three generations without 
education would reduce the civilized peoples of 
today to savagery, the proneness of the Semites 
to fall back into godless ways may be well under- 
stood; so too one may well understand the protests 
and lashings of the prophets who saw their people 
retrograding. ) 
(When the Israelites began to write their own 
history they were a highly developed race in which 
there were few traces of early savagery, but the 
habit of sacrificing the firstling was a remnant of 
earlier economic stress that had passed into their 
religion. In order to understand the Israelite

branch of the Semitic race and how it was possible 
for it to produce, on the one hand, the humani- 
tarian ideas that rule the world today, when at 
practically the same time its leaders were protesting 
against savage sacrifices, but a step removed from 
cannibalism, one can do no better than to quote 
the eloquent and learned Chwolson, though his 
theory of the innate quality of a race is open to 
serious objections. 
Commenting on the fundamental causes of the 
peculiarities of a people, one of which he says is the 
nature of ‘‘its heart and nervous system,’’ he thus 
describes the disposition of the Israelites?: 
“In reference to the disposition (Gemueth) and 
organization of the nervous system: the Semite 
possesses a deep, easily excitable disposition, and 
is capable of mighty feelings; he is, therefore, 
lively, mobile, easily excited, passionate, quickly 
enthused for an idea, active and enterprising, 
flexible and adapting, easily finding himself at 
home in strange relations and circumstances, 
accommodating himself to them without difficulty, 
without, however, allowing of being absorbed by 
them.” 
_While, therefore, some of the Israelites developed 
in humanitarianism and poetry and religion, under 
the favourable conditions in Canaan, others, under 
various other influences, reverted to former prac- 
tices. Among these practices was that of sacri- 
ficing the first-born child. )

  Sacrifice Born of Fear 141 
(To understand better how the people who gave 
to the world the Child’s Friend retained so late the 
habit of sacrificing children, the scope of the 
custom must be understood. 
The sacrifice of human beings to the gods, says 
Grimm,' rested on the supposition that human 
food was agreeable to the gods and not until man 
had advanced did the idea come that substitutes 
might be offered. In the cannibalistic stage of 
development these sacrifices were eaten by the 
sacrificers, thus establishing a connecting link 
between the humans aue the invisible gods whom 
they hoped to appease. ) 
(The whole theory of sacrifice will be better 
understood if we grasp the fact that it was born of 
fear. When a nation sacrificed out of gratitude or 
in apparent joyous exultation, it was in memory of 
days when they suffered and their gratitude was 
as much a propitiation as anything else. Born in 
fear, the next step in the development of sacrifice 
was to economize ‘‘without impairing efficiency.’’? 
The result of this second effort is seen in ingenious 
devices by which the burden on the worshipper is 
lightened by his substituting something less val- 
uable than what he is supposed to offer, or what 
the god is supposed to want, but which the wor- 
shipper believes will be acceptable. These sub- 
stitutions are always made when the forces of 
nature are treating man more kindly and when his

  142 History of the Child 
attitude toward his gods is less fearful, for the 
mind of man in time of plenty and security has 
always presupposed that time to be when the gods 
are more or less drowsy.) 
( With some primitive peoples, the sacrifice began 
as an offering of a meal to the ancestor who had 
gone before, but as with all primitive peoples the 
determining factor in religion is fear rather than 
affection, it became a method of soliciting favours 
for the future, and such were the sacrifices among 
the Greeks and Romans, the Hebrews, the Aryans, 
and the Chinese. *) | 
( Primitive man, when unwelcome children were 
born, found easy excuse for getting rid of them by 
offering them as a sacrifice to the impatient and 
fearful gods. That at some stage in the develop- 
ment of the parental instinct the excuse that the 
gods must be propitiated was needed to quiet the 
awakening mother love, is more than likely. 
And surely, no more crushing answer could there 
be to the request to allow a child to live than that 
the gods were angry and had to be propitiated)) 
( Another reason given for offering children was 
that, having just come from the other world, they 
were nearer to the gods and freer of sin and there- 
fore more acceptable. Such reasoning argues a 
stage far in advance of the cannibal who ate his 
own children under the idea that he was propitiat- 
ing an angry god. ‘‘The institutions of man de-

velop with considerable uniformity all over the 
globe, although as races advance, they naturally 
diverge more or less under the influence of different 
climate, food, and other conditions.”* Cannibal- 
ism was one of the earliest stages to which we are 
able to trace many of the customs even of today, 
and the idea of sacrifice of children undoubtedly 
had its origin in primitive cannibalistic feasts, 
“ceremonies that were softened by the rise of civi- 
lization as well as migration to more fertile land 
and an abundance of food sufficient to make the 
substitution of an animal for a human possible.’’ 
(Among primitive people the sacrifice of children 
is common. In most cases there is some specific 
result that is desired when the child is sacrificed. 
In the Tonga Islands in the South Pacific, the 
sacrifice of the child is called nawgia and strangling 
is the method adopted, whenever it is found that 
the ordinary cures do not affect some sick parent. 
It is said that the natives watch the ceremony of 
strangling with much pity but that they feel it is 
better ‘‘to sacrifice a child who is at present of no 
use to society, and perhaps may not otherwise live 
to be,”’ than to allowa sick chief to die. On one 
occasion when the gods had been offended the 
native priests decreed that the child of Toobo 
Toa, the chief, should be sacrificed, ‘‘on such

occasions the child of a male chief being always 
chosen as being worthier than others,’’ and a two- 
year-old child was strangled against the protests of 
its mother, who tried to conceal it.*/ 
( That the health of the Ynca also led to sacrifice 
of children is stated by Acosta: 
“They vsed in Peru to sacrifice yong children 
of foure or six yeares old vnto tenne; and the great- 
est parte of these sacrifices were for the affaires 
that did import the Ynca, as in sickness for his 
health, and when he went to the warres for victory, 
or when they gave the wreathe to their new Ynca, 
which is the marke of a King, as heere the Scepter 
and the Crowne be. In this solemnitie they sacri- 
ficed the number of two hundred children, from 
foure to ten yeares of age, which was-a cruell and 
inhumane spectacle. The manner of the sacri- 
fice was to drowne them and bury them with 
certaine representations and ceremonies; some- 
times they cutte off their heads, annointing them- 
selves with the blood from one eare to another.””? 
( Acosta also declared that when an ordinary man 
was sick and believed he would die, his own son 
was sacrificed to the Sun or to Virachoca. 
Francisco de Jerez says that the Peruvian In- 
dians sacrificed their own children and tinted the 
doors of their temples and the faces of their idols 
with the blood.

C‘They sacrifice each month their own children, 
and with their blood smear the faces of the idols 
and the doors of the temples, and sprinkle the 
blood over the graves of their dead.”’* 
It is certain, according to the story of Sieur le 
Moyne de Mourgues, that ‘‘in that part of Florida 
which is near Virginia,—and where the French are 
under the leadership of Sieur le Laudonniére—the 
people of this country regard their chiefs as sons 
of the Sun and, for this reason, they pay them 
divine honours, sacrificing to them their first- 
born.’’) 
C“ Their custom is,’”’ according to Le Moyne, ‘‘to 
offer up the first-born son to the chief. When 
the day for the sacrifice is notified to the chief, he 
proceeds to a place set apart for the purpose, 
where there is a bench for him on which he takes 
his seat. In the middle of the area before him is 
a wooden stump two feet high and as many thick, 
before which a mother sits on her heels, her face 
covered in her hands, lamenting the loss of her 
child. The principal one of her female relatives or 
friends now offers the child to the chief in worship, 
after which the women who have accompanied the 
mother form a circle and dance around with 
demonstrations of joy, but without joining hands. )

sacrificer takes the child and slays it in honour of 
the chief, before them all, upon the wooden stump. 
This offering was, on one occasion, performed in 
our presence.’’* ) 
“Tt was the Custom in Peru, to sacrifice Child- 
ren from four to ten Years of Age, which was 
chiefly done when the Inga was sick, or going to 
War, to pray for Victory, and at the Coronation 
of those Princes they sacrific’d two hundred 
Children. Sometimes they strangl’d, and bury’d 
them, and other times they cut their Throats, and 
the Priests besmear’d themselves with the Blood 
from Ear to Ear, which was the Formality of the 
Sacrifice. Nor were the Virgins (Mamaconas) of 
the Temple exempt from being sacrific’d and, 
when any Person of Note was sick, and the Priest 
said he must die, they sacrific’d his son, desiring 
the Idol to be satisfied with him, and not take away 
his Father’s life. The Ceremonies us’d at this 
Sacrifice were strange, for they behav’d themselves 
like mad Men. They believ’d that all Calamities

were occasion’d by Sin, and that Sacrifices were 
the Remedy.’’! 
/Further evidence of the attitude of the Indians 
is given by the first secretary of the Colony of 
Virginia Brittania, who asserted that the Indians 
in Florida sacrificed the first-born male child. 
According to this writer, their Quiyoughquisocks, 
or prophets to the Indians, persuaded the warriors 
to resist the settlements of the white people be- 
cause their Okeus, who was god of the tribe, would 
not be appeased by the sacrifice of a thousand 
children if they permitted the white people, who 
despised their religion, to dwell among them.? 
Cin parts of New South Wales such as Bathurst, 
Goulburn, the Lachlan, or MacQuarie, the first- 
born of every lubra was eaten by the tribe as a 
part of the religious ceremony. Here, too, it was 
the male infant that was more desirable as a sacri- 
fice, the female infants being sometimes allowed to 
live. In this connection, it is interesting to note 
that where children are killed without any other 
excuse than that they are a drain on the resources 
of their parents, it is the female children who are 
slaughtered. When, however, there is a so-called 
religious reason for the infanticide, it is the male 
child that suffers. )

‘(In India, as we shall see, children were frankly 
killed for economic reasons; but here too there are 
evidences of the sacrifice theory. Up to the be- 
ginning of the present century, the custom of offer- 
ing a first-born child to the Ganges was common, 
A custom akin to this was that of the Ganga Jatra, 
the murder of sick relatives on the banks of the 
sacred river. As late as 1812, a mother and sister 
burned a leper at Katwa near Calcutta, their ex- 
cuse being that by so doing he would be given a 
pure body in the next world.) 
| Women, too, who had been long barren dedi- 
cated their first child, if one were given them, to 
Omkar Mandharta.' 
Bathing in blood, especially the blood of child- 
ren, in Northern India was regarded as a power- 
ful remedy for disease. In 1870, a Mussulman 
butcher, losing his child, was told by a Hindu 
conjurer that in order to make the next child 
healthy, he should wash his wife in the blood of a 
boy, with the result that a child was murdered. 
At Muzaffar Nagar a child was killed and the blood 
drunk by a barren woman,’ 
In the city of Saugor in India, human sacrifices 
were offered up in the year 1800, when they were 
stopped by the local governor, Assa Sahib, al- 
though the Brahmin priests objected strenuously 
to the innovation. Outside the city, there was a 
spot where the young men sacrificed themselves

in order to fulfil the vows of their mothers. The 
belief was that when a woman was without a child, 
she could overcome barrenness by promising her 
first-born, if a male, to the god of destruction, 
Mahadea. If a boy was born after this vow, she 
concealed from him the vow until he attained the 
age of puberty, when it was his duty to obey his 
mother’s call and throw himself, at the annual fair 
on the sandstone hills, from a perpendicular height 
of four or five hundred feet and be dashed to pieces 
upon the rocks below. ? 
Among the Banjarilt, acaste of travelling traders 
noted in “Bhadrachellam and Rekapalli Talu-

starting off on a business journey, to procure a 
little child and bury it in the ground up to its 
shoulders. Then the traders would drive their 
loaded bullocks over the victim and in proportion 
as the bullocks ‘‘thoroughly trampled the child to 
death”’ was their belief in a successful journey in- 
creased. Probably very little credence can be 
given to their assertions that they have completely 
left_off such cruelties>

We come now to the results of recent excavations 
in Palestine. 
(There were discovered at Gezer, the bodies of 
adults that had been sacrificed at foundation rites 
and deposited with the corner-stones much as 
moderns deposit mementoes and newspapers. 
Mr. MacAlister, who had charge of the excavations 
at Gezer, says, however, that adult or adolescent 
victims were rare in comparison with the number 
of infants or very young children whose remains 
were found under the corners of houses. Such 
deposits were found in all the Semitic strata but 
were very rare in the Hellenistic stratum, showing 
that the practice died down when the Greeks came 
into control of the land. The children sacrificed 
at these foundation rites were deposited in the 
same manner as those found at the messobath 
or high place, where there was discovered a ceme- 
tery of jar-buried infants that went to show how 
general was the practice of sacrificing their new- 
born infants among the Canaanites. ) 
(“That these sacrificed infants were the first- 
born, devoted in the Temple, is indicated by the 
fact that none were over a week old. This seems 
to show that the sacrifices were not offered under 
stress or any special calamity, or at the rites 
attaching to any special season of the year. The

these infants must have been something inherent 
in the victims themselves, which devoted them to 
sacrifice from the moment of their birth. Among 
various races, various circumstances are regarded 
as sufficient reason for infanticide—deformity, the 
birth of twins, etc.; but among the Semites the 
one cause most likely to have been effective was 
primogeniture.”’*) 
In the vessels in which the infants were placed, 
were found by the excavators smaller vessels which 
were probably food vessels with a viaticum for the 
victim. 
(At Ta’ Annek? after the discoveries at Gezer, 
a cemetery containing some twenty infants, also 
buried in jars, was discovered about a rock altar, 
the age of the infants that had been sacrificed 
having been as much as five years. At Megiddo? 
underneath a corner of a temple, there were found 
four jars with the bones of children and near them 
smaller jars and a bowl, which undoubtedly con- 
tained the food that children were supposed to 
need in the other world. Professor Sellin sug- 
gests that the bones found at Tell Ta’ Annek

reason for the sacrifice of the children, for the 
foundation sacrifices were—one might almost say 
are, so recently have there been instances of the 
practice—of a different order from the sacrifice 
of the first-born) 
( On these foundation sacrifices, Dr. Driver has 
made some interesting notes. We are all familiar 
with our own foundation ceremonies, which are 
really nothing more or less than a modification of 
these primitive ceremonies that consisted almost 
entirely ot the sacrifice of a human being and in 
many instances of an infant, inasmuch as the 
infant, having just come into the world, was 
purer and nearer to god and therefore more 
acceptable. Traces of the custom of sacrificing 
a human life in order that some destructive god 
or demon might be propitiated and the lives of 
those about to occupy the building thereby made 
safer are found in India, New Zealand, China, 
Japan, Mexico, Germany, and Denmark. ) 
( The extent of these foundation sacrifices had 
been revealed by Dr. Trumbull in his Threshold 
Covenant, all going to show that different branches 
of the human family, though far removed, mounted 
much the same steps in their endeavour to achieve 
the truth about the world in which they lived. 
Among the Danes, when the fortifications were 
first being built around Copenhagen many years 
ago, the walls, as they were built, kept sinking in, 
and it did not seem possible that they would ever 
stand firmly.

    Sacrifice and Foundation Rites 153 
(“The workmen finally took a little girl, placed 
her at a table, and gave her play toys and sweet- 
meats. Then, as she sat there enjoying herself, 
the masons built an arch over her and in this way 
the walls were made solid.’’* 
A similar story is told? of a castle of Liebenstein. 
It was made fast and impregnable by buying a 
child from its mother and walling it in.) 
(Slavensk, a Slavonic town on the Danube, had 
beén devastated by the plague and when it was 
built anew the wise men of the town agreed that 
there must be a human victim. Messengers were 
sent out before sunrise to seize the first living 
creature they met. The victim was a child and it 
was buried alive under the foundation stone of the 
citadel, and from that time on, a citadel was called 
a Dyetinet, from Dyetina, a child.) 
Cin Africa in Galam, Tylor says‘ that a boy and a 
girl were buried alive before the gate of the city 
in order to make it impregnable. In other places, 
such as Great Bassam and Yarriba, such sacrifices 
were usual even when the foundation was only 
that of a house.) 
(In some places, such as among the Tantis of 
Africa, the sacrifice was made at every new moon. 
In Sargos, a girl was offered up that there might be 
good crops. In Bonny, they sacrificed every year

“The connection between cannibalism and 
human sacrifice,’ says Dr. Waitz, “Gs manifest 
enough in the festivals of Dahomey.’’! 
There were two principal and solemn sacrifices 
among the Pipiles, a Maya people in Central 
America—one at the commencement of summer 
and one at the beginning of winter. Little boys of 
ten and twelve years of age were the victims, and 
their blood was sprinkled in re direction of the 
four cardinal points.?) 
( Among the Milanau Dyaks when the largest 
house was being erected, a deep hole was dug and 
a slave girl was placed in it. An enormous timber 
was then allowed to descend on her and crush her 
to death. 
As late as 1843 in Germany, when a new bridge 
was being built at Halle, the common people 
fancied that a child was wanted to be walled into 
the foundations. According to Grimm, the tower 
called the Reichenfels Castle was built on a live 
child and a projecting stone marks the place. If 
that were pulled out, the wall, it is said, would 
tumble down.‘

stones of Scutari, but what they built by day, the 
Vila tore down at night. At last she made known 
to the kings that the place would never be finished 
until two brothers or sisters ‘‘of like name” were 
built into the foundations. Nowhere could such 
be found. Then the Vila required that one of the 
wives of the kings should be walled up in the 
ground. The next day the consort of the youngest 
king, never dreaming of such a decree, brought out 
some dinner to the workmen; thereupon the three 
hundred masons dropped their stones around her 
and began to wall her in. At her entreaty, they 
left a small opening and there she continued to 
suckle her babe who was held up to her once a day.” 
(The foundation sacrifice is well known in India. 
At Madras, it has long been a tradition that when 
the fort was first built a girl was built into it to 
render it impregnable.? A Raja was once building 
a bridge over the river Jargo at Chunar and when it 
fell down several times, he was advised to sacrifice 
a Brahman girl to the local deity. She has now 
become the Mari or ghost of the place and is 
regularly worshipped in time of trouble. In 
Kumaun, there are professional kidnappers known 
as Doghutiya, or two-legged beasts of prey, who 
go about capturing boys that they may be used in 
foundation sacrifices. }

HEBREW WRITERS ON THE ORIGIN OF THE RELIGION 
OF HUMANITY—CHILD SACRIFICE CONDEMNED IN 
THE STORY OF ISAAC—CIRCUMCISION SUBSTITUTED 
—REVERSION TO BARBARIC HABITS IN CANAAN— 
TRIUMPH OF THE PROPHETS. 
G AVING reviewed the ethnological and 
H archeological aspect of the attitude of the 
Semitic people toward the sacrifice of 
the first-born, we turn to the written record of the 
small bands of Semites who gave to the world the 
humane ideas that dominate it today. From that 
written record we will learn that nowhere among 
the civilization of the world was there the same 
spirit that there was in that outlandish corner of 
Syria. Israel was never content with the abuses 
of the world and in this her philosophy differed 
from Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, 
Chinese, and Indian philosophies as we have been 
able to judge of them in the writing of the civiliza- 
tions they produced. If, to make one more com- 
parison, the Greeks were wanting in humanity 
the Israelites were passionately human. ‘‘The 
Israelitish prophets were impetuous writers such 
as we of the present day should denounce as social-

  158 History of the Child 
ists and anarchists. They were fanatics in the 
cause of social justice. ’’*) 
Modern Bible criticism has made the period of 
the writing of the Elohistic part of the Hexateuch 
about 770 B. c.?. Whatever the sources that were 
drawn on and whatever actual historical value 
they have, we know that the ideas contained 
therein represent the ideas of the eighth century 
B.C. 3 
‘According to these writings, Abraham, the 
eponymic father of the Israelites, was tested in his 
loyalty to Yahweh by being told to take his son 
Isaac into the land of Moriah, a district in Pales- 
tine, and there sacrifice him as a burnt offering. 
In the land of Canaan at the time the Jahvist and 
the Elohist wrote of this temptation, the ceremony 
of sacrificing the first-born of a living thing was 
still practised; among the neighbouring peoples— 
the Phoenicians on one side and the Sabeans on 
the south-east—children were still sacrificed. The 
Elohist therefore was anxious to show that a 
thousand or more years back, in the time of the 
founder of their race, it was not the custom of the 
tribe to sacrifice children and that it was onl 
done when the Lord gave the especial command. 
With Abraham the command, while painful, was 
apparently not surprising. He went about the 
execution in a businesslike way, only to find when

he was about to sacrifice the boy, that the Lord 
was satisfied with his display of zeal and did not 
intend the command to be carried out. Then 
“Abraham lifted up his eyes, and behold, behind 
him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns: and 
Abraham went and took the ram and offered him 
up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.’’*) 
Here was the first case of substitution, in which 
the early writer testifies that not only was the 
substitution satisfactory to the deity, but the 
human sacrifice was forbidden and an animal pro- 
videntially provided that the ceremony of sacrifice 
might be gone through without loss of human 
blood. However strong the popular inclination 
to accept the bloody rites of the religion of the 
surrounding tribes, from that time there was a 
fixed standard to which the prophets and true 
believers of Israel held—human sacrifice had been 
stopped by the Lord himself.) 
Among the Assyrians also, father Orhan was 
represented as having substituted an animal for 
human beings, the Assyrian patriarch being repre- 
sented as a man of benevolent aspect, seated in an 
armchair without any sort of military pomp or 
circumstance.” 
(To make the substitution of an animal for a 
human being more effective, and more popular, 
Abraham entered into a covenant with Yahweh 
by which the deity was still given the blood of

humans without a life being sacrificed. The rite 
of circumcision is the substitution commanded by 
Yahweh himself: 
(“This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, be- 
tween me and thee, and thy seed after thee; 
Every man child among you shall be circumcised. ’’?/ 
This rite, mixed as it is with phallic worship 
(see Genesis), had its origin in the castration of 
prisoners of war,? and, as far as the Israelites were 
concerned, probably originated in Egypt, al- 
though it has been found to be performed among 
the tribes of Central Australia with a stone knife 
just as is recorded of the Israelites. With progress 
and the fact that use was found for prisoners, 
castration gave way to marking the prisoners, until 
the original significance passing, as among the 
Egyptians according to Herodotus, the practice 
became one of purely hygienic value.) 
( That this covenant with Yahweh was kept 
when all about them the first-born children of the 
Egyptians were sacrificed, the feast of the Pass- 
over (from mop, pesach, meaning “‘to pass by, 
to spare’”’) attests. Yahweh told Moses that he 
was to claim the lives of not only the first-born of 
the Egyptians “from the first-born of Pharaoh 
that sat on his throne unto the first-born of the 
captive that was in the dungeon,” but also the

  Significance of ‘‘Passover” 161 
first-born of all the animals in the land. That the 
chosen people might not suffer in this contemplated 
destruction they were instructed, through Moses, 
to take the blood of a lamb, ‘‘a male of the first 
year,” and “‘strike it on the two side-posts and on 
the upper door-post of the houses,” that it might 
be known wherein the faithful dwelt.> 
(Here we see the beginning of the threshold sac- 
tifice or covenant, which became, in time, the 
foundation sacrifice) 
(So complete was ‘this claiming of the first-born 
that ‘‘there was not a house where there was not 
one dead.’’*_D 
(From their deliverance from this visitation, 
Yahweh instructed Moses to “sanctify unto me 
all the first-born, whatsoever openeth the womb 
among the children of Israel; both of man and 
beast, it ismine.”’ Already there was the example 
of the patriarch Abraham that an animal might be 
substituted; now there was the statement from the 
One on high that the first-born of the chosen people 
might be redeemed. Of the temper of the people 
at this time and their proneness to fall into the 
vices of their neighbours, and of idolatry, we need 
only the statement of Joshua? that while in 
Egypt—Renan says that they were not there more 
than three hundred years—they acquired the habit 
of worshipping false gods.

worship of the golden calf while Moses was away

from them for a short time, is another evidence 
of their excitability, although modern scientists 
have declared that under adverse circumstances 
the entire civilized peoples would revert to bar- 
barity in three generations. : 
The struggle upward out of barbarism could 
have been attended with nothing less than hercu- 
lean belief on the part of the leaders of Israel, 
when we see this lapse came after their miraculous 
escape from Egypt and after the receipt of the ten 
commandments. Illuminating too is the fact 
that the making of the golden calf was superin- 
tended by no less a person than Aaron, the brother 
of Moses, his confidant and first lieutenant. ) 
When we come to the period of the Judges, we 
find the Israelites falling away from their human- 
itarianism. While Joshua and his contemporaries 
were alive, they held to their religion, but the gods 
of Canaan, together with the more easily under- 
stood and more deeply ingrained rites of idolatry, 
reappeared as soon as the patriarchs had passed 
away.) 
(Nothing indeed is more interesting in this study 
of the Old Testament than the record of the 
difficulty that the leaders and prophets had in 
keeping a semi-barbarous people up to their stand- 
ard of civilization and humanization. Ethno- 
logical and archeological data picture the struggle 
forward but feebly, when compared to the written 
records of the Israelites, especially during the period 
of the Judges. )
-P-A-G-E-223
  Israel in Retrogression 163 
(The period of the Judges was the period of the 
formation of the nation, and had there not been 
all around them reminders of their own previous 
nomadic habits, and had they been a less excitable 
people, there would not have been the recurrence 
to barbaric traits that we find. Even then, the 
progress of the Israelites in humanitarianism is 
unique in the world. From the settlement in 
Canaan, which was about 1200 B. c., until the 
birth of Christ, they suffered conquest, disintegra- 
tion, and many afflictions, but progressed steadily 
in humanitarianism. In that time the Greeks rose 
and fell, achieving great intellectual and esthetic 
perfection, but failing to even approach the Israel- 
ites in humanity. A few hundred years after the 
settlement in Canaan, the Romans appear as a 
civilized people and, aided by a transplanted stoi- 
cism, developed a great humanitarianism under the 
Emperors Trajan and Hadrian; the last named, 
however, despite his greatness, indissolubly linked 
with the degeneracy that was the mark of Greek 
self-centredness, or lack of humanity, as Mahaffy 
calls it.) 
The transition from idealism to nationalism is 
never affected with impunity, says Renan, and 
so the growing nation suffered in its material 
growth and through the insistence that Yahweh 
‘oved Israel and hated all the rest of the world.’’* 
Baal and Yahweh were not far apart and at Sechem 
there was a Baal-berith, or Baal covenant, which

-P-A-G-E-224
  164 History of the a 
the idolators worshipped as Baal, and the Israelites 
as Yahweh.' ‘‘If the religion of Israel had not 
gone beyond this phase, it is certainly the last 
religion to which the world would have rallied.’’? 
(It is in this period that we have the story of 
Jephthah, an outcast, the head of ish and an 
illegitimate son, who was asked by the Israelites 
of Gilead to help them against the Ammonites. 
Jephthah vowed that if he should be successful he 
would sacrifice to Yahweh the first thing that met 
him on his return from the campaign, and the 
first thing to meet him was his daughter. ‘‘And 
he sent her away for two months and she went with 
her companions and bewailed her virginity upon 
the mountains. And it came to pass that at the 
end of two months that she returned unto her 
father who did with her according to the vow which 
he had vowed.’’3 ) 
(It is suggested by Renan that what probably 
happened was that Jephthah, before undertaking 
a difficult war, sacrificed one of his daughters 
according to the barbarous custom put into prac- 
tice on solemn occasions when the country was in 
danger. ‘‘Patriarchal deism,”’ he says, ‘‘had con- 
demned these immolations; Yahwehism with its 
exclusively national principle was rather favour- 
able to them. Not many human sacrifices were 
offered to God nor to the Elohim. The gods

  Triumph of Yahweh 165 
whom they thought to propitiate by means of 
human sacrifices were the patriot gods, Camos of 
the Moabites, Moloch of the Canaanites, Mel- 
qarth of Carthage.” 
(The coming of David was the triumph of Yah- 
weh over the contending religions, though, as 
modern critics have pointed out, there was lit- 
tle humanitarianism in the semi-barbarous poet. 
When there was a three years’ famine in the land it 
was ascribed to the wrong done the Gibeonites by 
Saul and the Gibeonites were allowed to say what 
should be the sacrifice to atone for the wrong. The 
ancient historian records the fact that they asked 
that they might be allowed to hang the seven sons 
of Saul, and this was done. The sacrifice was asked 
for by the Gibeonites and it was for the purpose of 
ending the famine, but, incidentally, it enabled 
David to get rid of those who stood in his way.? ) 
(A few hundred years later, in the ninth century, 
we find the effect of the sacrifice of the first-born 
telling on the Israelites even though at that time 
it is evident that they themselves have given up 
human sacrifice. Jehoram, King of Israel, and 
Jehosophat, King of Judah, united to defeat the 
remarkable King of Moab, Mesha. The combined 
forces drove him within his strong fortifications of 
Kir-Haraseth and when he found that there was 
no way of escape, as a last resort: )

in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering 
upon the wall. And they [the Israelites] departed 
from him and returned to their own land.” 
The efficacy of the sacrifice is hereby admitted 
although it was offered to Camos and not to Yah- 
weh. The ancient historian says nothing in exten- 
uation of the effect. Ewald suggests that Yahweh, 
full of bitterness' against Israel for having driven 
the King of Moab to such a deed of fearful bravery, 
filled the army full of terror. Renan, however, 
suggests that though they did not then offer human 
sacrifices themselves, the Israelites still had the 
fullest faith_in their efficacy and retired lest they 
be defeated. ) 
( Coming nearer, to a period that is contempora- 
neous with that which is revealed in the excavations 
at Gezer and Tell Ta’Annek, we have the direct 
statement in Kings and Chronicles? that Ahaz, 
the eleventh King of Judah (about 741 to 725 B.C.), 
“made his son pass through the fire.” To gain 
the aid of Tiglath-Pileser against the Edomites and 
the Philistines he became a vassal of the Assyrian 
monarch and his name appears among the names 
of those who acknowledged his sovereignty and 
paid tribute.’ 
Manasseh was another King of Judah (697 to 
642 B. C.) who sacrificed his son,# emulating Ahaz 
~in this as in other heathenish customs, increasing

the popularity of the foreign gods and causing the 
streets of Jerusalem to run with the blood of 
the prophets whom he put to death. In every 
way he tried to make the heathen religions more 
acceptable and accessible to the whole nation by 
providing them with temples and altars. In 
addition to sacrificing one of his own sons to Mo- 
loch, he revived that religion on a large scale, 
building for it a magnificent burning place (To- 
phet) in the valley of Hinnom on the southern wall 
of Jerusalem. The tortures to which the children 
were subjected soon associated themselves in the 
minds of the pious with what punishment beyond 
the grave must be like, so that the name of hell 
itself was taken from this valley, Ge-Hinnom,*) 
as the reforms of Josiah we hear no more of 
such treatment of children but we must not sup- 
pose that while barbarous practices were going on 
the prophets had remained silent. The latter day 
writers revolted against the entire idea of sacrifice, 
Hosea declaring: ‘‘I desired mercy and not sacri- 
fice; and the knowledge of Yahweh more than 
burnt offerings.’ Jeremiah even declared that 
the Lord had not commanded the people to sacri- 
fice when they came forth from Egypt: \ 
} (“For I spake not unto your fathers, nor com- 
manded them in the day that I brought them out 
of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings 
or sacrifices. ’’3 )

to become the ethical keynote of the future 
religion: 
‘‘Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and 
bow myself before the high God? Shall I come 
before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a 
year old? 
“Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of 
rams, or with ten thousand rivers of oil? Shall I

‘ey the one remaining tribe of the Semites, a 
name that has meant so much to the civiliz- 
ation of the world, it is hardly necessary to 
offer a prelude. Coming, however, in the mouth 
of the defenders of the latest religion and as the 
youngest of the Semitic languages, it is necessary 
to say of the Arabic language that it is nearer akin 
than any of the others to the original archetype, 
the Ursemitisch, from which they are all derived; 
“just as the Arabs, by reason of their geographical 
situation and the monotonous uniformity of the 
desert life, have, in some respects, preserved the 
Semitic character more purely and exhibited it 
more distinctly than any people of the same 
family.”*

and third, the Mohammedan period, beginning

first periods the little that we know except the

The Sabeans were inhabitants of the ancient kingdom of 
Sheba, located in south-western Arabia. According to the 
records of Mohammed Abu-Taleb Dimeshqi, the Sabeans’ 
sacrifices were made to the planets when they reached their 
point of culmination. They sacrificed either a man or a woman 
according to the divinity who was being worshipped. To the 
Sun, a selected girl was sacrificed; to the Moon, a man with full 
face. To Jupiter, a boy three days old, the child of the girl who 
was sacrificed to the Sun. To Mercury they sacrificed a young 
man of brownish colour who was a scribe and well educated; to 
Mars, a very red man with a red head; to Venus, a beautiful 
woman. These sacrifices were connected with various prepar- 
ations and mysterious ceremonies. 
The following passage, showing the extreme of horrible bar- 
barism, describes one of their sacrificial ceremonies; it is from Dr. 
D. Chwolsohn’s Die Ssabier und der Ssabismus (vol. ii., pp. 28-29). 
“On the 8th of August the Sabeans pressed the wine for the 
gods and called it by many different names. On this day they 
sacrificed to the gods, in the middle of the forenoon, a new-born 
male child. First the child was slaughtered, then boiled until it 
became very soft, when the flesh was taken off (the bones). The 
flesh was then kneaded with fine flour, oil, saffron, spikenard and 
other spices, and, according to some, with raisins. It was then 
made into small cakes of the size of a fig, and baked in a new oven. 
This was used by the participants in the mystery of Shemal. 
No woman, no slave or son of a slave, or no idiot was al- 
lowell toeatofit. To the killing and the preparation of the child 
only three priests were admitted. Everything remaining, such 
as the bones and other things not eatable, the priests offered as 
a burnt sacrifice to the gods.”

Age-of Ignorance or Barbarism, and, in the ample 
remnant of the poetry of that day, we are enabled 
“to picture the life of those wild days in its larger 
aspects, accurately enough.’’* 
The pagan Arabs had long been in the habit of 
burying their infant daughters alive, the excuse 
offered being that it cost too much to marry them 
and that their lives were too closely attended with 
the possibility of disgrace “if they should happen 
to be made captives or to become scandalous by 
their behaviour.” For these reasons there was 
never any disguising the fact that the birth of a 
daughter was considered a great misfortune and 
the death of one a great happiness. )

  172 History of the Child 
ployed by the Arabs to get rid of the female 
infant was to have the mother who was about to 
give birth to a child lie down by a pit when she 
was about to deliver the child, and if it was a 
daughter, it was thrown into the pit without any 
more ado.* 
\Another version is that when a daughter was 
born the father, if he intended to keep her, would 
have her clothed in a garment of wool or hair as an 
indication that later he intended to have her keep 
camels or sheep in the desert. If, on the other 
hand, he intended to do away with her, he would 
allow her to live until she was six years of age, and 
then said to her mother: 
“Perfume her and adorn her, that I may carry 
her to her mothers.” 
This being done, he led her to a well or pit that 
had previously been dug for that purpose, pushed 
her into it, and then, filling the pit, levelled it 
with the rest of the ground. It does not seem that 
the latter practice could have been other than 
rare. 
Al Mostatraf is quoted by Sale as saying that 
these practices were common throughout Arabia, 
and that the tribes of Koreish and Kendah were 
particularly notorious in this respect. The mem- 
bers of the former tribe were in the habit of burying 
their daughters alive in Mount Abu Dalama, near 
Mecca.)

of Tamim were noted for their addiction to this 
practice and claimed, in after years, that it was 
brought about by the action of their chief, Qays, 
who was acontemporary of the Prophet. Accord- 
ing to this story, Moshamraj the Yashkorite de- 
scended on the camp of Qays and carried off, among 
other women, the daughter of the sister of Qays. 
This captive was assigned to the son of Moshamraj, 
and when her uncle appeared to ransom her, she 
declined to leave her new-found husband. Qays 
was so incensed over this action that, on returning 
home, he is said to have killed all of his daughters 
by burying them alive, and never thereafter allowed 
another daughter to live.) 
(During his absence some time later, his wife 
gave birth to a daughter, and knowing the feeling 
of the father she sent the infant to some relatives 
to have the child raised in secrecy. When Qays 
returned home she told him that she had given 
birth to a dead child.) 
(Years after, when’the child had grown up, she 
came to visit her mother and while the two were 
together they were discovered by Qays. 
“TI came in,” related Qays himself to Mo- 
hammed, ‘‘and saw the girl; her mother had 
plaited her hair, and put rings in the side locks 
and strung them with sea shells and put on a 
chain of cowries, and given her a necklace of dried 
dates. I said:) 
“«Who is this pretty girl?’ and her mother wept 
and said:
-P-A-G-E-234
  174 History of the Child 
“«She is your daughter’; and told me how she 
had saved her alive. 
“So I waited until the mother ceased to be 
anxious about her; then I led her out one day, 
dug a pit and laid her in it, she crying: 
“*Pather, what are you doing with me?’ 
“Then I covered her up with the earth and still 
she cried: i 
“*Pather, are you going to bury me? Are you 
going to leave me alone and go away?’ But I 
went on filling in the earth till I could hear her 
cries no longer, and that is the only time that I 
felt any pity when I buried a daughter.” 
There were others however before Qays who did 
not take this attitude toward children. Sa’sa’a, 
the grandfather of the poet Al-Farazdac, fre- 
quently redeemed female children that were about 
to be buried alive. Inasmuch as he too was of the 
tribe of Tamim his action would indicate that 
Qays was not aninnovator. In order to save them 
he was obliged to buy them off and the price he 
paid every time was two she-camels, big with 
young, and one he-camel.? 
Boasting of this humane action on the part of his 
ancestor (who was the Francois Villon of his day) 
Al-Farazdac vauntingly declared one day before 
the Khalifs of the family of Omayya: 
“T am the son of the giver of life to the dead.”

    Humaneness of Sa’sa’a 175 
When he was reproved for this boasting he 
justified it by quoting the Koran: 
“He who saveth a soul alive shall be as if he had 
sayed the souls of all mankind.’’* 
The Aghani explains the practice on the ground 
of poverty and credits Sa’sa’a with being the first 
one to attempt to put an end to the practice. 
Thereafter this humane grandparent of a vaga- 
bond poet was known as Muhiyyu’l-Maw’udat, or 
“He who brings buried girls to life.” According 
to the Kamil he saved as many as one hundred and 
eighty daughters. ) 
“That infanticide was rare in the desert is the 
claim made by defenders of the faith. The follow- 
ing verses are quoted by Lane as going to show 
that the Arabs really had a tender feeling toward 
their women and their children; and that infanti- 
cide, which is commonly attributed to the whole 
Arab nation of every age before Islam, was in reality 
exceedingly rare in the desert, and after almost 
dying out only revived about the time of Moham- 
med. It was probably adopted by poor and weak 
clans, either from inability to support their child- 
ren, or in order to protect themselves from the stain 
of having their children dishonoured by stronger 
tribes, and the occasional practice of this barbar- 
ous and suicidal custom affords no ground for 
assuming an unnatural hatred and contempt for

girls among the ancient Arabs. These verses of 
a father to his daughter tell a different story: 
If no Umaymah were there, no want would trouble my 
soul, no labour call me_.to toil for bread through 
pitchiest night; 
What moves my longing to live is but that well do I 
know how low the fatherless lies, how hard the 
kindness of kin. 
I quake before loss of wealth lest lacking fall upon 
her, and leave her shieldless and bare as flesh set 
forth on a board. 
My life she prays for, and I from mere love pray for her 
death—yea, death, the gentlest and kindest guest 
to visit a maid. 
I fear an uncle’s rebuke, a brother’s harshness for her; 
my chiefest end was to spare her heart thé grief of 
a word. 
Once more, the following lines do not breathe 
the spirit of infanticide: 
Fortune has brought me down (her wonted way) 
from station great and high to low estate; 
Fortune has rent away my plenteous store: of all my 
wealth, honour alone is left. 
Fortune has turned my joy to tears: how oft did For- 
tune make me laugh with what she gave!

thrust from door to door as hard,

Nay, but our children in our midst, what else but our 
hearts are they walking on the ground?

says no to slumber all night long." 
CThat the custom was deep-rooted when Moham- 
med arrived on the scene is evident from the fact 
that Ozaim the Fazarite, according to Abu Tam- 
man, when he decided to save his daughter Lacita, 
had to conceal that fact from his people, although 
she was his only child.? )

barians [the Goths] were terrified at this marvel- 
lous prodigy and from that time forth when they 
proceeded on any enterprise, displayed none of 
their former and usual ferocity, but advanced 
with hesitating steps.’

the wily Arab might have been impelled not so 
much by the cannibalistic strain as by cunning 
and generalship.

undoubtedly from cannibalistic times is the vow 
of the mother to drink wine from the skull of the 
slayer of her son.3/ 
These were the conditions that Mohammed 
undoubtedly ended by his preaching.

hath forbidden ye; that is to say that ye be not

This, Jalal-ad-din says, was revealed at Medina: 
“By God, ye shall surely be called to account 
for that which ye have falsely devised. They 
attributed daughters unto God but unto them- 
selves children of the sex which they desire. And 
when any of them is told the news of the birth of a 
female, his face becometh black, and he is deeply 
afflicted: he hideth himself from the people, because 
of the ill tidings which have been told him; consid- 
ering within himself whether he shall keep it 
with disgrace, or whether he shall bury it in the 
dust.’’? 
And again he says: “‘Kill not your children for 
fear of being brought to want: we will provide 
for them and for you: verily, killing them is a 
great sin.” And finally he says: ‘‘When the sun 
shall be folded up; and when the stars shall fall; 
and when the mountains shall be made to pass 
away; and when the camels ten months gone with 
young shall be neglected; and when the wild beasts 
shall be gathered together; and when the seas 
shall boil; and when the souls shall be joined again 
to their bodies; and when the girl who hath been 
buried alive shall be asked for what crime she was 
put to death.” )

andhislaw. And, bloodthirsty as he was in war, it 
is to his credit that much was done to check infan- 
ticide wherever the Mussulman reigned. The 
extent to which the law on children was regulated 
by the Arabs at a time when Europe was in dark- 
ness may be seen in ‘‘Al Hidaya,” by Shaykh 
Burhan-ad-din Ali, who died a.H. 591 and was, 
according to his contemporaries, a distinguished 
author on jurisprudence. 
| The Hidaya consists of extracts from a number 
of the great works on Mussulman jurisprudence in 
which the authorities on different opinions are set 
forth together with reasons for preferring any one 
adjudication.* In this work an entire book is de- 
voted to the Lageets, which, it is explained, signi- 
fied, in the primitive sense, anything lifted from the 
ground, but later came to mean an abandoned 
child, and, in the law of the Arab, had come to 
mean a child that had been cast out from fear of 
poverty or for other reasons.? 
Here it is stated that, when the finder sees a 
Lageet under circumstances which suppose that if 
it is not taken up it may perish, it is not only 
praiseworthy to adopt a child, but it is incumbent. 
Coming centuries after Christ, it is noteworthy 
to observe that Mohammed was able to instil 
into his followers such humane doctrines as the 
freedom of the foundling and its maintenance from

Maintenance of Foundlings 181 
the funds drawn from the public treasury at a time 
when the Christians of Europe were groping vainly 
as to the proper treatment of infants. 
“A foundling is free,’ says the Shaykh Bur- 
han-ad-din Ali, ‘because freedom is a quality 
originally inherent in man; and the Mussulman 
territory in which the infant is found is a territory 
of freemen, whence it is also free: moreover, free- 
men, in a Mussulman territory, abound more than 
slaves, whence the foundling is free, as the smaller 
number is dependent to the greater.’’* 
‘Christian philosophy offers few more striking 
mixtures of humanity and democracy. It was also 
the law when the foundling was to be maintained, 
the expense of bringing up the child was to be paid 
out of the public treasury, and in favor of this law 
the opinion of Omar was cited. A very good reason 
given for this was that ‘‘where the foundling dies. 
without heirs, his estate goes to the public treasury.’’ 
{ The person who took up the foundling was 
‘own as a Multagit and it was the law of 
that day that the Multagit could not exact any 
return from the foundling on account of main- 
tenance except where he had been ordered by the 
magistrate to bring up the foundling at its own 
expense, in which case the maintenance ‘‘is a debt 
upon the foundling, because, the magistrate’s 
authority being absolute, he is empowered to exact 
the return from the foundling.’”’? }

  182 History of the Child 
According to Al-Quduri,* this was the proper 
thing to do as the letting out was regarded as con- 
ducive to the education of the Lageet. In the Jami 
Saghir the hiring out of the foundling was opposed 
on the ground that the Multagit had no right to 
turn the faculties of his foundling to his own ad- 
vantage. The opinion of Shaykh Burhan-ad-din 
Ali was that Al-Quduri was right and that the 
child did gain by being let out. 
( In Al-Siyar there is given a specific injunction 
that children must not be slain: 
“Tt does not become Mussulmans to slay women 
or children or men that are aged, bed-ridden, or 
blind, because opposition and fighting are the only 
occasions which make slaughter allowable (accord- 
ing to our doctors), and such persons are incapable 
of these. ’’? 
( In the minute instructions in regard to divorce, 
much care is given as to the disposition of a child. 
Where the husband and wife separate, the law 
was that the child went with the mother, and this 
was based on a decision of the Prophet. )

prophet, saying ‘O, prophet of God! this is my 
son, the fruit of my womb, cherished in my bosom

which the prophet replied, ‘Thou hast a right in

thou dost not marry with a stranger.’’’* ) 
(if the mother of an infant died, the right of 
Hidana, or infant education, rested with the mater- 
nal grandmother. So deeply was this idea imbued 
that even if the mother were a hated Zimmi or fe- 
male infidel subject, married to a Mussulman, she 
was still entitled to the Hidana of her child until the 
time when the child was capable of forming a judg- 
ment with respect to religion. When such a time 
arrived the child was generally taken from the 
mother if she continued to be an infidel, in order 
that no injury might come to it from imbibing 
the doctrines of a Zimmi.

  Lack of Humanity in Greece 185 
(The Greek’s kindness did not extend to his new- 
born children. We shall see later among the 
Romans that, from the time of Romulus to the 
passing of the Roman Empire, there was an up- 
ward tendency in the attitude of the Romans 
toward children. In eight centuries, the Romans 
changed, from a people indifferent to the fate of the 
newly-born, to a nation over which the humane 
Antonines ruled, and ruled successfully.) 
( Among the Greeks, from the time of Homeric 
legend, which is supposed to be about 1000 B.c., 
up to the time of the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, a period 
of over a thousand years, the Greeks changed not 
at all in callous indifference as to what became of 
that portion of their population that was daily 
exposed. Ardent defenders of the Greeks, like 
Andrew Lang, see in the fact that little mention 
is made in the Homeric legend of the exposure of 
female infants, an indication that ‘Homeric 
society with its wealth and its tenderness of heart 
would not be so cruel” as to expose little girl 
babies.* ) 
(Homer says little of children and the only child 
to appear directly in the action of the Iliad is the 
infant son of Hector and Andromache. ‘‘ When 
Andromache meets Hector as he is hurrying to the 
field of battle, the nurse accompanying her car- 
ties in her arms the merry-hearted child, whom 
Hector called Scamandrius, but the rest called 
him Astyanax (Defender of the City), for Hector

alone defended Ilium.’’’* It is true that there 
is no example of exposure in Homer, though 
Hephaistos says his mother Hera desired to con- 
ceal him because he was lame.? 
( But why one should expect a tenderness con- . 
trary to the history of the race is difficult to 
imagine, especially in view of the picture Achilles 
offers, as he drags the slain Hector about the walls 
of Troy to the lamentations of the dead man’s 
father and mother. 
Wherever there was a Greek, colony we have a 
story of the exposure of some god or hero. Greek 
mythology might also be said to have had, as one 
of its foundations, the right of the parent to reject 
its offspring. The Dorians of Crete pictured even 
mighty Jove as a victim of this practice, and as 
being suckled by a goat. He was taken as soon 
as he was born, to Lystus first, the most ancient 
city of Crete, and then; / 
“Hid in a deep cave, ’neath the recesses of 
the divine earth in the dense and wooded Agean 
mount.’’3

Rhea brought forth Poseidon she delivered him

     Exposure in Greek Myth 187 
Among the Lemnians, Hephaistos was supposed 
_to have been exposed,‘ as was the Dionysus of the 
Etolians and the Thracians. 
In Epidaurus it is said that Coronis, when 
. she gave birth to Asculapius, ‘exposed the infant 
on that mountain which at present they call Tit- 
thion, but which was before denominated Myrtion; 
the name of the mountain being changed, because 
the infant was suckled by one of those goats which 
fed upon the mountain.’’? ) 
In Argos, when Crotopos reigned, a grandson 
was born to him, but the infant’s mother, fearing 
the wrath of her father, ‘exposed the child to 
perish. In consequence of this, it happened that 
the infant was torn to pieces by the dogs that 
guarded the royal cattle.’’3 
In Arcadia, Auge, when she was delivered of 
Telephus, “concealed him in the mountain 
Parthenion, and he was there suckled by a hind.’’4 
In his disappointment at not having a son born 
to him, Jasus had the Arcadian Atalanta exposed 
on the Parthenian hill’; the ancestor of all the 
Athenians, Ion, and the founders of Thebes, 
Amphion, and Zethus, were exposed on the same

Perhaps we can best judge the attitude of the 
Homeric Greeks toward children by the later point 
of view of the flower of Greek intellect. There is 
not a line in Plato to indicate that the practices we 
regard as so reprehensible were at all abhorrent to 
him. In fact, there are passages that would 
indicate that he not only regarded infanticide as 
inevitable, but as unobjectionable; and in any 
case, the incidental references to the practices of 
his day show that the matter was one that had 
given him no concern and had not disturbed his 
philosophic calm. _Thus, Plato has Socrates say 
in the Theetetus?: 
\“‘Then this child, however he may turn out,

round the hearth with him, and see whether he is

passion if I take away your first-born? 6 
And in another place, Socrates emphasizes not

rial advantages that accrued to its progenitors$ :

Is this a slight matter about which you and Ly-

Cis it true that, aside from the laws of Gortyna, 
which were excavated in 1884 on the island of 
Crete,* and the injunctions of Lycurgus, as given 
to us by Plutarch, we have no positive declaration 
as to the attitude of the legislator in reference to 
children; but what is lacking in positive legislation 
is made up by the plethora of literary allusions, 
going to show a condition singularly heartless. It 
is interesting to note that the laws of Gortyna, 
which represent a period of civilization about 500 
years before Christ, are not as humane as the 
law ascribed to Romulus by Dionysius of Halicar- 
nassus, though the Greek laws are those of a people 
supposedly more civilized than the tribes then 
beginning their history on the Capitoline Hill. 
There was a prohibition in the first law ascribed to 
Romulus: and the extent of the law, as far as we 
may presume to judge it, was to urge caution on 
the people who were about to destroy their off- 
spring. Under the Roman law, all children were 
to be kept for a short time at least, this limiting 
the power of the father to kill, whereas the law of

Gortyna emphasized the power of the father in the 
matter of the life and death of the child; in one 
specific instance, it gives the mother direct per- 
mission to do away with the infant.) 
“Tf a woman bear a child,” so ran the Cretan 
laws, ‘while living apart from her husband (after 
divorce), she shall carry it to the husband at his 
house, in the presence of three witnesses; and if he 
do not receive the child, it shall be in the power of 
the mother either to bring up or expose it. Ifa 
female serf bear a child while living apart, she 
shall carry it to the master of the man who married 
her, in the presence of two witnesses. And if he do 
not receive it, the child shall be in the power of the 
master of the female serf. But, if she should 
marry the same man again before the end of the 
year, the child shall be in the power of the master 
of the male serf, and the one who carried it and 
the witnesses shall have preference in taking the 
oath. If a woman living apart should put away 
her child before she has presented it as written, 
she shall pay, for a free child, fifty staters, for a 
slave, wenty-five, if she be convicted. ) 
eis the man have no house, to which she may 
carry it, or she do not see him, if she put away her 
child, there shall be no penalty. If a female serf 
should conceive and bear without being married, 
’ the child shall be in the power of the master of the 
father.”

  “The Phoenician Maidens” 191 
(In prehistoric times, the chief of the yevos 
exercised his right of domain over his own house, 
by deciding whether children should be brought 
up or exposed. The reason back of this practice 
was undoubtedly economic: ‘‘the fact of yesterday 
is the doctrine of today,”’ says Junius. > 
(The Hellenes in their attitude toward children 
were as all the Aryan people, and, with few excep- 
tions, as most primitive people where moral ideas 
had little developed; the right of the male parent 
to kill his child if he so willed is, with variations, a 
relic of the Stone Age. ) 
cAmong the Greeks, the practice was well es- 
tablished, for, wherever we find a Greek colony, the 
traditions of the people show that either a notable 
human or some mythical god began his history with 
the story of exposure. 
At Athens infanticide was especially common. 
Aristophanes refers to it in a way that shows it was 
an accepted practice. The first poet of humanity, 
Euripides, dwells at great length, in the story of 
Ton, on the exposure of an infant toward the end of 
the fifth century; and in ‘The Phoenician Maid- 
ens,”’ he has Jocasta tell the story of the exposure 
of Gdipus*:

In the fourth century B.c., the favourite figure 
in the comedy of the day was the child that had 
been exposed and saved, and afterwards found by 
its parents. Terence and Plautus afterward used 
this theme frequently, and undoubtedly their 
comedies were all borrowed from the Greek. 
Strange as it may seem in the cultured and refined 
city of Athens with its great philosophers and 
its wonderful art, the object of jest was a starving 
and dyinginfant. Glotz, in discussing the motives 
of this frequent exposure of infants in Athens, as- 
cribed to the shame of young women an initiatory 
prominence. Viewing the subject more broadly, 
however, we know that shame really plays a minor 
part. 
‘More frequently than not, the exposure of the 
infant was ordered by the male parent. It was a 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
    
  Exposed Infants in Greek Drama 193 
live question, current and customary, that the 
father was obliged to face every time a child was 
born: would he raise it or would he expose it? As 
with all primitive peoples, the child was his abso- 
lute property.* On the fifth day, the Amphidromia 
took place. If one interprets literally the passage 
in the Theetetus of Plato, one must conclude that 
this ceremony for receiving an infant into the 
house was rigorously followed out in all cases, and 
that before the altar of Hestia, ‘the goddess of the 
hearth, the father finally decided and proclaimed 
whether he intended to keep the child and protect 
it, or to abandon it. On the other hand, a father 
who did not wish to recognize his child probably 
needed no preliminary ceremony for such a deci- 
sion; if it was decided to abandon it, there was 
probably no Amphidromia. 
(Doubt as to the paternity of the child, to judge 
by the history and literature of the times, was of 
frequent occurrence and this usually led toexposure. 
Agis, King of Sparta, refused to recognize Leo- 
tychides, a son born of his wife. In the Hecyra 
of Terence, the Athenian Pamphile does not wish 
to serve as father to an infant of another. Per- 
seria, “‘having viewed at an amorous crisis a statue 
of Andromeda,”’ conceals her infant from her hus- 
band.’ At Gortyna, the divorced woman had 
to present her son to her former husband; if that 
man did not take it, then the woman had her

choice between nourishing it or exposing it. In 
most cases, the disavowal of paternity meant the 
exposure of the infant. ) 
(But the mere fact that the legitimacy of the 
child was incontestable did not save it; many 
Greeks were discouraged by the thought of the 
care and trouble children necessitated. Thou- 
sands of these little ones seem to have been re- 
sented by the Athenians, with what Glotz calls 
“ singuliére vivacité.”* With the intensive and 
complete education necessary for those reared, 
some children had to be sacrificed_to so compli- 
cated and burdensome an enterprise. ) 
“No,”’ says a character in Menander, ‘‘there is 
nothing unfortunate in being a father, unless one 
is the father of many children.” 
“Nothing more foolish than to have children,” 
says a Greek proverb. ‘‘To raise children is an 
uncertain thing,’’ said the philosopher Democritus; 
“success is attained only after a life of battle and 
disquietude. Their loss is followed by a sorrow 
which remains above all others.”’) 
It was not necessary to have children, reasoned 
the nimble-minded Athenians; many who wished 
both tranquillity and posterity adopted a young 
man whose education was already complete. The 
greater number of exposures should not be attrib- 
uted, however, to this excessive love of tranquillity. 
The principal objection to children was their 
expense. For the daughter, it was necessary to

  Avoidance of Large Families 195 
prepare a dot: for boys, there was the expense of 
an education prolonged until they were sixteen or 
eighteen years of age. The latter imposed the 
opening of an account not easy to close. ) 
(“I thought my family now large enough,” says 
the father of Daphnis in explaining to the new- 
found son why it was he was exposed." ) 
“Sons of the very rich,’’ said Plato, ‘‘who com- 
mefice to frequent schools at a very early age and 
leave them late’”"—the rich themselves did not wish 
to bring up too many sons to such an expensive 
life. The rich father of Daphnis considered a son 
and a daughter a large family. ) 
/ At a pinch, the Athenians Would undertake to 
bring up a first child, but, as a rule, the second was 
condemned. It was not for themselves, alone, 
that this was done, they claimed: it was also for 
their children that the heads of the Greek families 
dreaded poverty. The direct transmission and 
equal partition of property among the male child- 
ren was part of the Greek law, and a fair-sized 
estate, if broken into many parts, made small 
provision for many children. Hesiod wished for a 
single son par famille: ‘Let there be only one son to 
tend his father’s house: for so shall wealth increase 
in the dwelling.’’? And Theognis reproached the 
citizens for having no other ideal than to bury 
away treasures for their children. Even in later 
times, Xenophon speaks of the paternal foresight 
* Longus, Daphnis and Chloé, book iv. 
2 Hesiod, Works and Days. 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  196 History of the Child 
that led to continual worrying over the care of 
children yet to be born. ) 
It was Diphilus, or Menander, who found in the 
reality of the Greek life and communicated it to 
the author of the Adelphi, this counsel addressed 
to the father: ‘‘ Manage, pinch, and save, to leave 
them (your sons) as much as you can.”’? 
But it was not only the poor who found expo- 
sure expedient, although they had an excuse; they 
“had not the heart to leave their misery to their 
progeny like a grave and dolorous malady.”’ 
( Toa philosopher of the first century after Christ, 
it appeared as the greatest scandal, however, that 
a number of fathers ‘‘who did not have the excuse 
of poverty, who were well off and even opulent, 
should dare to refuse food to the puny infants 
in order to enrich their elders, should dare to kill 
their brothers in order that the living might have 
the greater patrimony.”? / 
This was indeed the Greek excuse or explana- 
tion—some of the children had to be sacrificed 
that others might be raised. The head of a Greek 
family, if asked why he had exposed some of his 
children, would have probably answered in the 
words of the Scythian Anacharsis, ‘‘ Because I love 
the children I have.” This was the principal 
reason alleged by the Greeks for exposing their 
progeny on the highways, and the father of Daph-

(In the religious and social ideas of the ancients, 
the female child was of little importance—a son 
alone perpetuating the race. The daughter was 
hardly a member of the family in which she was 
born, from the day of her birth until the day she 
was married. On that day, she passed into the 
possession of her husband and became his, body 
and soul. Up to the time she was married, she was 
in charge of her parents: after that time, she did 
not-even exist for them.) 
\On the contrary, it was a sacred duty to bring 
up a boy. To raise one, was to provide against 
all possible trouble; whereas a girl was an expensive 
luxury, a sacrifice for which there was no com- 
pensation, and for this reason, in the legend, the 
father of Atalanta refused to bring up his daughter. ) 
“Do you remember,’ asks Sostrata of her 
husband in the Heautontimorumenos, ‘‘me being 
pregnant, and yourself declaring to me, most per- 
emptorily, that if I should bring forth a girl, you 
would not have it brought up?””? Thus it was that 
Antiphili, although of good family, was exposed 
by order of her mother. )

comedy to see how the Greeks plainly preferred 
boys, and under what various artifices they dis-

as arule, they might possibly be saved by 
others and precautions were frequently 
taken to this end. The gruesome task of doing 
away with the infant was generally entrusted to a 
slave or to a midwife, who were willing, apparently, 
to undertake many services." The time usually 
chosen was early in the day, inasmuch as the child 
would perish if it passed the entire night without 
attracting attention. \ 
The lexicographers and the scholiasts of the 
time speak of children being left in deserted places. 
In the ‘‘golden days,” they were placed where 
they could be seen. There is evidence that the 
most frequented places were the most popular— 
the hippodromes, the entrances to the temples, 
and the sacred grottoes, where they would be most 
in evidence. A watch was kept on the place or it ‘& “fe Greeks who exposed their children hoped,

  200 History of the Child 
was revisited, in order to be sure of the fate of the 
infant. } 
Care was usually taken to wrap the child up 
carefully. When Laymonde, the shepherd, discov- 
ered Daphnis, the child was being suckled by a goat. 
“Struck with natural astonishment, he advances 
closer to the spot and discovers a lusty and hand- 
some male child with far richer swathing clothes 
than suited its fortune in being thus exposed; for 
its little mantle was of fine purple, and fastened 
by a golden clasp; and it had a little sword with a 
hilt of ivory.’ ) 
(The jests of Aristophanes show that more 
often children were exposed in large copper pots 
with two handles, called kuirai (xuteé&). The 
Athenians had been in the habit of making 
sacrifices to some of their divinities in these kutrat, 
and it is likely that when children were first 
abandoned, they were placed in these receptacles 
that they might invoke the protection of the 
immortals. Recent excavations at Gezer and Tell 
Ta’ Andkk show children were sacrificed in a similar 
way. ( Various objects were placed with the child when 
it was so exposed. Creusa, the daughter of Erec- 
theus, King of Athens, when she exposed Ion, 
the son whom she had secretly borne to Apollo, 
“observant of the customs of her great progenitors,” 
in addition to leaving with him what ornaments 
she had, also added:

A branch of olive then I wreathed around thee, 
Plucked from that tree which from Minerva’s rock 
First sprung; if it be there it still retains 
Its verdure; for the foliage of that olive, 
Fresh in immortal beauty, never fades.” 
(This, and the sacred bandelettes, were always 
the symbols of inviolability. 
This final act of maternal affection, characteris- 
tic of both the human and the barbaric side of 
Greek parents, became, in time, a widespread 
custom. When the child was exposed, there was 
generally placed alongside of it a small basket or 
collection of trinkets. The royal daughter of 
Erechtheus attached to the neck of her son many 
precious ornaments, including a serpent of massive 
gold. The shepherd Laymonde found on Daphnis 
a clasp of gold and a small ivory sword. Among 
the very poor, hand-made collars, shoulder straps, 
with various trinkets of little worth, were used 
to mark the infant. ) 
In all this, dramatists saw but a means to es- 
tablish the identity of the hero and heroine and an 
assistance to the dénouement. The ceremony, with 
its pathos and its strangeness, was, to tragic as 
well as to comic writers, but a means to end the 
fifth act. The pity of it all never seems to have 
occurred to the Greek mind) 
(It was rare that the father or the child-mother 
who renounced the infant had any real desire to

-P-A-G-E-264
  202 History of the Child 
find it when better days came. The real wish was 
that the child might be taken up by some stranger 
before death came and the trinkets were an in- 
ducement to befriend the child.) 
( If, on the other hand, the child should die, the 
feeling was that these ornaments would assure for 
it a happy life on the other side of the Styx. 
For this reason the favoured objects of mothers 
were amulets; and, as in the case of the serpent 
placed around the neck of Ion, Creusa hoped to 
invoke the aid of Minerva, who had guarded her 
ancestor, Erichthonius, with two dragons; the 
object being to watch over the child’s existence. 
These gewgaws were supposed to ai the infant 
exposed all the rights of a suppliant. 
(As to how far these ceremonies of supplication 
were successful, as to how far they commended 
the unfortunate infant to the public, is a grave 
question. From the religious and literary myths 
one might imagine that the greater number of the 
infants were saved. We read of Hephaistus, 
nourished by the Sintians or by Thetis; of Atalanta 
by a bear; of Zeus and Dionysos, nursed by 
the nymphs; the shepherds found and received 
Telephus, Amphion, and Cidipus; Ion, by a 
priestess, and Sirus, by a beggar. ) 
Greek artists frequently show a Satyr holding in 
his arms a newly-born that he had found on the 
road. 
Poets of the new comedy delight to represent 
their heroes, or, more frequently, their heroines, as

people who had gone through the trial of exposure 
and were raised by either courtesans, shepherds, or 
innkeepers. It is in this way that Menander, 
among others, shows us Silenium growing up in the 
house of Melenis to whom she has been given by 
the evil woman who picked her up’; Casina treated 
as a daughter by the brave Cleostrata.? 
Longus, in this way, brings Daphnis and Chloe 
into the cabin of a goatherd. 
(But these examples prove little about the actual 
conditions, only going to show the facility of the 
writers of the time, and Glotz suggests that these 
scenes flattered the Athenians, who liked to think 
of themselves as a philanthropic people. 
Apparently, the first impulse when a child was 
found was to ignore it, for the attitude of Athen- 
ian society was probably well expressed by Longus 
when he said: ) 
“Those who seek paternity are many.” 
‘In fact, the author of Daphnis and Chloe says 
that when Daphnis was first seen by the shepherd 
being suckled by a goat, ‘‘ Laymonde (the shepherd) 
resolved to leave it to its fate, and to carry off only 
the tokens; but feeling afterward ashamed at the 
reflection, that in doing so he should be inferior in 
humanity, even to a goat, he waited for the ap- 
proach of night and then carried home the infant 
with the tokens.”’$

story seeks to excuse himself for having exposed 
his daughter, by a number of bad reasons: he did 
not have the means, it was a moment of weakness, 
he hoped that the nymphs would take pity on the 
child: and then, there were so many people who 
did not have children, etc. The most interesting 
of his reasons, however, is the statement that 
he had spent his fortune equipping theatrical 
choruses! 
As a rule, when adoption did take place it was 
not for the benefit of the child. In many instances, 
those who wished to adopt a son waited and adopted 
a grown-up one so as not to have the trouble and 
expense of educating him. 
As set forth in the plays, it was apparently not 
infrequent that a courtesan sought to attach a 
lover, or a wife a husband who was slipping away 
from her, by adopting a child and passing it off 
as her own. It was to this subterfuge that Silen- 
ium, in the Cistellaria of Plautus, owes her life. 
Speaking of the incident, the Procuress in the 
play, says: ) 
“But once upon a time, that girl (Silenium) who 
has gone hence in tears, from a lane I carried her 
off a little child exposed. . . . Imadea present of her 
to my friend, this courtesan, who had made men- 
tion of it to me that somewhere I must find for her 
a boy or a girl, just born, that she herself might 
pass it off as her own. 
““As soon as ever the opportunity befell me I 
immediately granted her request in that which she

     had asked me. After she had received this female 
child from me, she at once was brought to bed of 
the same female child which she had received from 
me. . . . She said that her lover was a foreigner.’’' 
It is hardly likely, however, that many courtesans 
in real life were willing to be so encumbered, and 
perhaps, as Demosthenes says, this was only the 
sort of thing one ‘‘sees in tragedies,” like the fatal 
and convenient malady described by Heine as a 
sort of ‘‘fifth act sickness.” 
(That the substitution of foundlings and exposed 
children was frequent in Greece is evident, how- 
ever, from the many plays bearing this name. 
Cratinus the younger was the author of a piece 
called The Substituted Child [ixoGodtyaoc], and 
the title was also used by Menander. Athenzus 
quotes from a play by Alexis entitled The Supposi- 
tious Child? and from one by Epinicus called 
the Suppositious Damsels [broRoddAopevar] and from 
another by Crobylus called the Pseudo-Supposi- 
tious Child (Falsus suppositus).4 
In the Thesmophoriazuse, Aristophanes depicts 
the father of Euripides, Mnesilochus, as making a 
tactless defence of his son-in-law at the festival of 
Thesmophoria by abusing the very women he 
would placate. °)

(« { nd I know another woman,” he says ‘‘who 
for ten days said she was in labour, till she pur- 
chased a little child while her husband went about 
purchasing drugs for a quick delivery. But the 
child an old woman brought in a pot with its 
mouth stopped with honeycomb that it might 
not squall. Then, when she that carried it nodded, 
the wife immediately cried out: ‘Go away, hus- 
band, go away, for methinks that I shall be 
immediately delivered.’ For the child kicked 
against the bottom of the pot. And he ran off 
delighted, while she drew out the stoppage from 
the bottle and it cried out. And then the abomin- 
able old woman who brought the child, runs smiling 
to the husband, and says: ‘A lion has been born 
to you, a lion; your very image, in all other re- 
spects whatever, and its nose is like yours, being 
crooked like an acorn cup.’”* ) 
\That there was a class of people who looked on 
children in the light of good or bad bargains we 
must assume from the certainly serious words of 
Demosthenes in his oration against Midias. In 
his attack on his physical assailant, Demosthenes 
says that the real mother of Midias was a wise 
woman because she got rid of him as soon as he 
was born, whereas the woman who adopted him 
was a foolish woman because she made a bad 
bargain. )

and learns that he had been exposed, congratulates 
himself on having escaped slavery, indicating 
that in all probability the majority of children 
saved after they had been exposed by their parents 
were saved by the professional slave dealers. The 
general view, however, was that children were 
cheap, Xenophon,’ declaring that ‘‘good slaves 
when they had children generally become still 
better disposed, but bad ones increase their power 
to do mischief.” 
( Only in two instances as far as we know did the 
law of the Greeks reach out to protect the child 
against the destroying whim of the parent. Ac- 
cording to Alian’ the Thebans were not allowed 
to expose their children or leave them in a wilder- 
ness under the pain of death. If the father were 
extremely poor, the child, whether male or female, 
had to be brought to the magistrate in its swaddling 
clothes, and there delivered to some person who 
would agree to bring up the child and when it was 
grown up, take it into service and have the benefit 
of its labour in return for its education. \ 
(As to the other instance of the law protecting 
the child it has been truly said that all that Lycur-

gus did was to insist that all ‘‘fit” children should 
be raised. 
“Tf,” says Plutarch,* “they (the Spartans) 
found it puny and ill-shaped, they ordered it to be 
taken to what was called the Apothete, a sort of 
chasm under Taygetus, as thinking it neither for 
the good of the child itself, nor for the public 
interest, that it should be brought up, if it did not 
from the very outset, appear made to be healthy 
and vigorous.” : 
And this was the most ‘“‘protecting” move of the 
ancient Greeks.

called the legal movement which fructified

nineteenth century, had its beginning in the 
eighth century B.C. in Rome;/it is. doubly interest- 
ing that legend ascribes to Romulus the first 
interest in what can conservatively be called the 
child protection movement: 
/ Like all other lawmakers—even legendary ones 
—tspecially those who: sought to prepare and 
safeguard their states for and against hostile 
neighbours, the first concern of the founder of 
Rome was a strong nation; and a strong nation 
meant necessarily as many adult males in good 
health and physical condition as possible. Sol- 
diers were more important than other human 
beings; in this the supposed founder followed the 
spirit of his time and the standard of his age of 
development. 
According to the legend, Romulus, having made

peace with the Sabines and become the king of 
both people on the death of Tatius, was bent on 
making the new city impregnable, working out a 
system of government that, in the mind of the 
historian, was worthy of ‘‘a man of great military 
accomplishments, personal courage and extremely 
capable of instituting the most perfect sort of 
government. ’’* 
To the end that there might be as perfect a 
fighting machine as possible, Romulus pledged his 
people to bring up all males except those who were 
lame or monstrous from birth. To the same end, 
and according to the same authority, he pledged 
them to bring up the first-born of the females— 
and in this he acted purely in the spirit of the time 
and as the founder of a warlike race.| Personal 
interest may be conceded, inasmuch as he would 
have been the victim of the practice of exposing 
children had his uncle Amulius had his way.? 
In his introduction to the Institutes of Justinian,3 
Sandars declares that Roman law will be better 
understood if those interested will apprehend the 
distinction between the contribution of Romulus 
and the tribe of Ramnes, who dwelt on the Pala- 
tine Hill, and the contribution of Numa and the 
Titienses who dwelt on the Capitoline and the 
Quirinal. The two races combined to make a 
united society, the Ramnes bringing distinct ideas 
of public law and, in the dimmest days of history,

    presenting the features of a carefully organized 
polity. ‘‘When the tribe went out to war it did 
not conquer lands for the benefit of individuals, 
but_for the whole people.” * 
(The Titienses, or Quirites, on the other hand, 
were of Sabine extraction. To them are traceable 
the private law, and, what is of interest to us, the 
peculiar notions of the family and of property. 
The great peculiarity of the Sabine law, or as it was 
called by the Latin writers, the jus Quirium, was 
the form of the manus—the hand. The manus 
was the conqueror’s sign of conquest, or rather the 
insignia of the freebooter; all he laid hand upon 
became absolutely his; he could deal with it as he 
pleased. All that his wife and children had, also 
belonged to him, to be done with as he willed— 
even their lives. This was the Sabine contribution 
to what afterward became ‘‘Roman Law,’ when 
the Sabine tribes of the Capitoline Hill and the 
Ramnes tribe of the Palatine united to form the 
city of Rome. > 
Nowhere in law or history is there so interesting 
a duality as this origin of Rome and the Roman 
law, and no single custom arising as it did, has 
affected civilization as strangely and so widely.

London or New York as an example of the extent 
of the Rome of that day—it seems impossible that 
such a law, thus accepted, should become the law > 
of the world, and remain so for centuries. 
\ This power of the Roman father over the very 
lives of his children was called the patria potestas 
and nowhere else in a civilized community was 
there anything like it.* He had the power to sell 
his children, he had the* ‘power to mutilate them, 
he had the power to kill them; \and it is because 
there is evident first, in the laws ascribed to 
Romulus, an intention to abate that power, not 
only for military purposes but for what we would 
now call humane reasons, that I have referred to 
the first Roman lawmaker as an innovator along 
lines which have been historically neglected/ 
‘It matters little whether or not the Romulus of 
Plutarch and Dionysius existed; it does matter 
that the human note, was in the laws of his time, 
and that citizens of the new city were enjoined 
not only to bring up all healthy male children— 
and at least one female child—but that all chil- 
dren must be allowed to live until they were three 
years old, unless they were lame or eos

tion of the rights of children. ine the lame and 
* Gibbon, vol. iv., p. 341: “The law of nature instructs most 
animals to cherish and educate their youthful progeny. The law 
of reason inculcates to the human species the returns of filial 
piety. But the exclusive, absolute and perpetual dominion of the 
father over his children is peculiar to the Roman jurisprudence 
and seems to be coeval with the foundation of the city.”
-P-A-G-E-275
  Pledges of Romulus 213 
the monstrous in the eyes of this early lawgiver 
had some rights, for it was further decreed that 
parents in doing away with them must act not 
entirely on their own judgment. 
(‘These (the lame and monstrous infants) he 
allowed their parents to expose, provided they first 
showed them to five of their neighbours and these 
also approved of it, and besides other penalties he 
punished those who disobeyed this law with the 
confiscation of half their fortunes.” * 
It may be contended perhaps that we are giving 
high attributes to one who is not much more than a 
mythical person, but no other explanation of the 
law of Romulus is offered than that already re- 
ferred to in Dionysius. 
(Despite the credit given to Numa Pompilius, 
by both Plutarch and Gibbon, Romulus gains by 
the comparison, although Numa amended one of 
the laws of Romulus in the matter of the right of a 
father to control a son up to the point of being 
able to sell him as a slave.” 
CTf a father gives his son leave to marry a woman 
who, by law, is to partake of his sacrifices and 
fortunes, he shall no longer have power of selling 
t Dionysius Halic., bk. ii., par. 15. 
2W. A. Hunter, Roman Law, p. 190, calls the conclave of 
neighbours a “humane and interesting exception.’ John F. 
McLennon, in Primitive Marriage, says it is a “fine example of 
good old savage law.’’ According to Hunter, infanticide receives 
its first customary check when the destruction of males and the 
eldest female is forbidden: the ancient tribes preferring rather to 
steal their wives than to rear them.

    his son”—such was the amendment of Numa for 
which Plutarch commends the Sabine lawmaker; 
but in amending the law of Romulus permitting 
a father to sell his children, the second king of 
Rome was actuated by the idea of making it 
attractive for the young women to marry; doubt- 
less he was having no easy time in eradicating the 
differences between the two warlike tribes first 
brought together under his predecessor. Lessening 
the power of the parents, as he did in the most 
material degree,* it was for the purpose of general 
polity and the accomplishment of his own har- 
monious designs, rather than for what I like to call, 
even in that early day, humanitarian reasons. 
There was no consideration of the child, or the 
female as such in Numa’s amendment. His 
object was to make marriages more desirable that 
there might be more male Romans. ? 
As a matter of fact, declaration of the power of 
the father over the women and children of his 
family was nothing more on the part of Romulus 
than the codification of the laws of the past, with 
the softening provisos to which I have already

2“Numa Pompilius,” Plutarch, Dryden’s Translations, vol. 
ix., p. 106: “He is also much to be commended for the repeal, or 
rather amendment, of that law which gives power to fathers to 
sell their children; he exempted such as were married, condition- 
ally that it had been with the liking and the consent of their 
parents; for it seems a hard thing that a woman who had given 
herself in marriage to a man she judged free, should afterwards 
find herself living with a slave.”

referred. ( The power of the father to imprison, 
scourge, or sell his son for a slave, or put him to 
death, was not lessened even when that son had 
risen to the highest honours of the State, as we 
shall see later} ; 
CExpulsion of the kings and the establishment of 
the Republic is dated B.c. 509, some two hundred 
and fifty years after the reputed founding of the 
city. With this stern period begins a series of 
thrilling examples of the use made of the patria 
potestas—stories that in themselves show how the 
power of the father extended over the life of the 
child, even when the child had become a man, and 
that man had been honoured by the State as was 
Cassius Viscellinus. The latter, although a tribune 
of the people and the author of the first Agrarian 
Law, was tried in the house of his own father, who, 
after having him whipped, “‘commanded him to be 
put to death and his estate consecrated to Ceres.) * 
That there was little progress made in the next 
great step in the history of Roman law, by which 
of course one refers to the adoption of the laws of 
the Twelve Tables, was because those laws were 
practically the codification of the ancient cus- 
tomary law of the people, despite the story that 
the patricians dispatched three commissioners to 
t Valerius Maximus, edition of 1678, lib. v., cap. viii. Accord- 
ing to Niebuhr, the story was disbelieved, and the historian 
himself says it is an invention by those who found it difficult to 
believe that after three consulships and as many triumphs, 
Cassius was still in his father’s potestas. Hist. of Rome, vol. ii.,

Athens to bring home a copy of the laws of Solon. 
Acrid political fights, uncertain and sometimes 
corrupt administration of the law, led to the 
commission empowered to draw up what after- 
ward became the Twelve Tables and the founda- 
tion of the whole fabric of the Roman law. 
(As the laws of the Twelve Tables represented 
the earliest fight against privilege, it would be 
too much to expect that they should contain any 
amelioration of the statute which gave the father 
the right to sell or kill his children. Even the 
language of the laws, in the fragments which have 
come down to us, shows in rugged, concise, and 
sternly imperative style that the law gained the 
respect in which it eventually came to be held, by 
no soft or easy methods.* 
“Tf the complainant summon the defendant 
before the magistrate, he shall go; if he do not go, 
the plaintiff may call a bystander to witness, and 
take him by force;”’ this is the first section of the 
first paragraph of the laws of the Twelve Tables. 
( Where there was so much sternness, and where 
every family was presided over by a parent who 
had the right to inflict death as a punishment for 
disobedience, the disciplinary attitude of the 
Roman mind naturally became such, no matter 
what it had been in the beginning, that tender or 
human emotions had but little place. It is not 
surprising therefore that the one extract of the 
laws of the Twelve Tables, relating to our subject, 
Stephen, Hist. of the Criminal Law of England, p. 1.
-P-A-G-E-279
    Rome of the Republic 217 
should deal curiously, abruptly, and sharply with 
the power of the father to sell his son, a power that 
was diminished only after the_son’s spirit must 
haye been entirely extinguished./ 
( Si pater filium ter venum duit, filius a patre liber 
esto—if a father sells his son three times, let the 
son then go free of the father. /In other words, 
three times did the father have the right to dispose 
of his son as a slave; and, while a slave might 
purchase his freedom, by paying his master, the 
son of a Roman citizen did not become free until 
the father had abused his right and misused the 
potestas three times. 4 
One sees the Rome of the Republic in the plays 
of Terence and Plautus, and the attitude of the 
fparents toward exposure is vividly shown in the 
Heautontimoroumenos of the former. 
(N early always the exposed child died. Occasion- 
ally some escaped through the tenderness or 
cupidity of some passer-by who would pick up an 
exposed child either out of pity or for the material 
profit that came with the possession.) 
(Sometimes mothers who were obliged to obey 
the orders of their husbands, arranged to have their 
children rescued. The comedy of Terence goes to 
show what the attitude of the father was under 
such circumstances. It is indeed, as De Gour says, 
“a chapter of the morals of the Greeks and 
Romans seen in action.’ 
Chremes, departing on a long voyage, orders

his wife, Sostrata, who is about to have a child, to 
expose the child if it should turn out to be a girl. 
In obeying this order, she hopefully places a ring 
with the child. 
Years later she meets the child at a bath and is 
given (by her own daughter) a ring to guard. 
Sostrata recognizes the ring and when she sees 
her husband the following dialogue ensues: 
Sos. (turning ’round). Ha! my husband! 
Curem. Ha! my wife! 
Sos. I was looking for you. 
CuremM. Tell me what you want. 
Sos. In the first place, this I beg of you, not to. 
believe that I have ventured to do anything con- 
trary to your commands. 
CurEM. Would you have me believe you in 
this, although so incredible? Well, I will believe 
you. 
Sos. Do you remember my being pregnant, and 
yourself declaring to me, most peremptorily, that 
if I should bring forth a girl, you would not have it 
brought up? 
Curem. I know what you have done, you have 
brought it up. 
Sos. Not at all; but there was here an elderly 
woman of Corinth, of no indifferent character; to 
her I gave it to be exposed. 
Curem. O Jupiter! that there should be such 
extreme folly in a person’s mind. 
Sos. Alas! what have I done? 
Curem. And do you ask the question? 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
  Confession of Sostrata 219 
Sos. If I have acted wrong, my dear Chremes, 
I have done so in ignorance. 
CuREM. This, indeed, I know for certain, even 
if you were to deny it, that in everything you both 
speak and act ignorantly and foolishly: how many 
blunders you disclose in this single affair! For, in 
the first place, then, if you had been disposed to 
obey my orders, the child ought to have been dis- 
patched; you ought not in words to have feigned 
her death, and in reality to have left hopes of her 
surviving. But that I pass over; compassion, 
maternal affection, I allow it. But how finely 
you did provide for the future! What was your 
meaning? Doreflect. It’s clear, beyond a doubt, 
that your daughter was betrayed by you to this 
old woman, either that through you she might 
make a living by her, or that she might be sold in 
open market as a slave. I suppose you reasoned 
thus: ‘‘Anything is enough, if only her life is 
saved.” What are you to do with those who 
understand neither law, nor right and justice? Be 
it for better or for worse, be it for them or against 
them, they see nothing except just what they 
please. 
Sos. My dear Chremes, I have done wrong, I 
own;Iam convinced. Now this I beg of you; inas- 
much as you are more advanced in years than I, 
be so much the more ready to forgive; so that your 
justice may be some protection for my weakness. 
Cure. I'll readily forgive you doing this, of 
course; but Sostrata, my easy temper prompts you 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
  220 History of the Child 
to do amiss. But, whatever this circumstance is, 
by reason of which this was begun upon, proceed 
to tell it. 
Sos. As we women are all foolishly and wretch- 
edly superstitious, when I delivered the child to 
her to be exposed, I drew a ring from off my finger 
and ordered her to expose it, together with the 
child; that if she should die, she might not be with- 
out some portion of our possessions. * 
CuremM. That was right; thereby you proved 
the saving of yourself and her.? 
Sos. (holding out the ring). This is the ring. 
CureM. Whence did you get it? 
Sos. From the young woman whom Bacchis 
brought with her. 
CureM. What does she say? 
Sos. She gave it to me to keep for her, whilst 
she went to bathe. At first I paid no attention to 
t Madame Dacier observes upon this passage, that the ancients 
thought themselves guilty of a heinous offence if they suffered 
their children to die without having bestowed on them some of 
their property; it was consequently the custom of the women, 
before exposing children, to attach to them some jewel or trinket 
among their clothes, hoping thereby to avoid incurring the guilt 
above mentioned, and to ease their consciences. 
2 Madame Dacier says that the meaning of this passage is this: 
Chremes tells his wife that by having given this ring, she has 
done two good acts instead of one—she has both cleared her 
conscience and saved the child; for had there been no ring or 
token exposed with the infant, the finder would not have been 
at the trouble of taking care of it, but might have left it to perish, 
never suspecting it would be inquired after, or himself liberally 
rewarded for having preserved it. (Bohn trans.) See chapters 
xii. and xiii.

it; but after I looked at it, I at once recognized 
it, and came running to you. 
CurEM. What do you suspect now, or have 
you discovered, relative to her? 
Sos. I don’t know; unless you enquire of 
herself whence she got it, if that can possibly be 
discovered. 
Crem. Is this woman living to whom you 
delivered the. child? 
Sos. I don’t know. 
CuREM. What account did she bring you at 
the time? 
Sos. That she had done as I had ordered her. 
Curem. Tell me what is the woman’s name, 
that she may be inquired after. 
Sos. Philtere. 
CuREM. Sostrata follow me this way indoors. 
Sos. How much beyond my hopes has this 
matter turned out! How dreadfully afraid I was, 
Chremes, that you would now be of feelings as 
unrelenting as formerly you were on exposing the 
child. 
CureM. Many a time a man cannot be such 
as he would be? if circumstances do not admit of 
it. Time has now so brought it about, that I 
should be glad of a daughter; formerly I wished 
for nothing less. 
There is no evidence that the Romans as a 
people at any time approved of the sale of children,   
This he says by way of palliating the cruelty he was guilty of 
in his orders to have the child put to death. 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  222 History of the Child 
and while the suggestion is made by Gibbon that 
early in the days of the kings impoverishing condi- 
tions occasionally made it necessary to dispose of 
members of the family, from the time of the 
adoption of the Twelve Tables as the codified law 
of Rome there is not a single indication that the 
power of the father over grown-up children was 
used otherwise than sparingly, and with a view 
to strengthening the stern and military character 
of the Roman idea of family. (The main use of the 
provision for the sale of children, in time of pros- 
perity at least, was to put the boy out to business, 
this being in general more a form that took the 
place of what was later apprenticeship and, still 
later, the labour contract. As late as Constantine 
this was permitted, even of new-born children, but 
only in cases of extreme need (propter nimiam 
paupertatem),* and then when it seemed the only 
way to prevent their parents from murdering them.)

World. The visitor to Pompeii today, noting the 
large and heavy paving blocks, the narrow side-

twenty thousand inhabitants but a million; the 
noise and the congestion increased out of all 
proportion to its size because of the character of 
its dwellers, for Rome had a large foreign popula- 
tion. As in modern New York or London, it was 
in the foreign quarters that were found the dis- 
comforts, the loud misunderstandings, and the 
noisy, tragic fights for small things.) 
The stranger arriving in Rome had hardly en- 
tered its gates when he was being jostled and 
shoved. The narrow streets were filled with pedlars 
calling their wares of all kinds, from matches (sul- 
phurata), in exchange for broken glass where money 
was scarce, to a dish of boiled peas for an as, or fine 
smoking sausages for those who had more money. 
Idlers filled the streets at all hours, but especially 
at the lunch hour (the sixth) when business ceased 
and those who patronized the cafés (taberne), were 
hurrying to get to their accustomed tables.”

taberne, built up against the houses, this practice 
becoming so much of a nuisance (as in modern

to be issued against them, forcing the owners to 
remove the encroachments and confine themselves 
to the area of the house. /

226 _ History of the Child 
A drunken man taking the entire via in his 
navigation—to the amusement of the crowd; a 
member of the city guard hurrying some offender 
to the court; or, reclining in his Jectica, a noble, 
carried by six uniformed slaves, his other nu- 
merous attendants clearing the way for him— 
all these added to the noise and confusion—while 
through it all children crowded the curb with their 
games. > 
‘Such was the Rome that Augustus found, its 
proud citizens masters of the world, luxurious, 
sensual, disdainful of the very idea of duty, idling 
days away while they scoffed at marriage. | But 
the foreigners, the freedmen, and the slaves married, 
and when the burden of a new child was too much 
for the small income made by amusing or serving 
some Roman citizen, the little newcomer was 
thrown into the Tiber or left unmarked on a busy 
thoroughfare. One of the first undertakings of 
Augustus was to try to remedy these evil condi- 
tions by laws and fiscal measures} his principal 
endeavour being to put an end to the corruption 
of morals and the exhaustion of the legitimate 
population. ) 
From the day of the battle of Actium (B.c. 31) 
when the Roman world practically lay at his feet, 
Octavius, or Augustus as he was afterward called, 
while gratifying his ambition in adding to his 
power, studiously and ostentatiously observed the 
forms of popular government. In this he was 
paying heed to the fate of his uncle and also 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
    Laws of the Twelve Tables 227 
conciliating the people, though with every in- 
gratiating move he increased his power. 
One of the first laws he proposed was the lex 
Julia (de maritandis ordinibus) which was rejected 
by the comitia tributa, B.C. 18, but was adopted in 
A.D. 4. To this was added as a supplement the 
lex Papia Poppea, the two being known as the 
lex Julia et Papia or as nove leges, or simply leges, 
the latter reference indicating that they were 
referred to as the laws par excellence. Not only 
marriage, but everything connected with it was 
treated in these two laws, which really constituted 
a code, the most extensive after the laws of the 
Twelve Tables. 
(These laws made a great impression on Roman 
society. | | How completely customs had swung to 
extremes since the days of Romulus is shown in 
this lex Papia, as Gaius calls it{ ‘Instead of 
securing the father in his right over the life of 
children, as the stern head of the house who might 
decide at will whether he should let his offspring 
live, the law now decreed that it was through the 
children that he gained a status in the community. 
Persons who were not married and had no children 
were unable to inherit; the unmarried person not 
being able to take any part of what had been left 
to him, and the married person without children 
(orbus) being able to take only one half.t Among 
* Gaius, ii., 286: ‘“ Unmarried persons who by the lex Julia are 
debarred from taking inheritances and legacies were in olden 
times considered capable of taking fideicommissa. Likewise 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  
228 History of the Child 
the provisions of the lex Julia, or the leges, were 
those entitling that candidate for office who had 
the greatest number of children to preference. 
Of the two consuls it was decreed that he should 
' be the senior whose children were the most numer- 
ous; a relief from all personal taxes and burdens 
was granted to citizens who had three children if 
they lived in Rome, four if they lived i in Italy, and 
five if they lived in the provinces. /) 
With the establishment of the taduca, by which 
there was instituted a punishment for sterility 
and a reward for legitimate procreation, it can be 
seen that there would follow some diminution in 
the number of children exposed, though according 
to Tacitus, * ‘‘marriages and the rearing of children 
did not become more frequent, so powerful are the 
attractions of the childless state.” 
By giving the people, or the common treasury, 
the benefit of the clause forfeiting the inheritance 
on account of sterility, the law was recognizing 
the populus as the common father, a legal concept 
that is becoming more and more the attitude of 
the twentieth century, and was then first trench- 
antly expressed. 
childless persons, who by the lex Papia lose half their inheritance 
and legacies because they have no children, were in the olden 
time considered capable of taking fideicommissa in full. But 
afterward by the senatus consultum Pegasianum they were 
forbidden to take fideicommissa as well as inheritances and 
legacies. And those were transferred to those persons named in 
the testament who had children, or if none of them had children, 
to the populus, just as the rule is regarding legacies and inherit- 
ances.” 1 Tacitus, Ann.,, iii., p. 28.

Reforms of Augustus 229 
Suppressed in part by the constitution of Cara- 
calla as to the privileges of paternity to the claim 
upon the caduca, and by Constantine as to the 
penalties for celibacy, these. laws were not com- 
pletely and textually abrogated until Justinian. 
They were the beginning, however, of the new 
movement; out of the degeneration and degrada- 
tion of the waning days of the Republic there had 
come at least this forward step, though the patri- 
cians complained that these provisions gave rise to 
despised informers and opportunities for tyrannical 
misuse of power. 
(\ The child now had some other than a future use; 
it had an immediate value. Occasionally, in 
times past, strangers had picked up children 
exposed by their parents and had reared them as 
slaves, or maimed and blinded them for the pro- 
fession of begging. Augustus set aside a reward 
of two thousand sesterces (about $40.00) for, the 
person who would rear an orphan. This was the 
seed of a growing humanity, the first intimation of, 
an inclination to treat children with es 
though it contrasts with Augustus’s own persona 
conduct when his anger was aroused. Both his 
daughter and granddaughter were so profligate 
that he banished them; when his granddaughter 
Julia was delivered of a child after sentence, he 
ordered that the child be ‘‘neither owned as a 
relative nor brought up.” *

reign of Nerva, 96 av} the violent sway of the 
army and the tragic fate of successive emperors 
cloud the history of Roman law and progress. 
( The Emperor Claudius distinguished himself by 
ordering that Claudia, a child by his first wife, 
“who was in truth the daughter of his freedman 
Boter, be thrown naked at her mother’s door.”’* 
There were no successors to the great jurists of 
the type of Capito and Labeo, whose opinions in 
Augustan days were accepted by even the em- 
peror himself. With the coming of Nerva there 
was a great change in the attitude toward children. 
Despite a short reign of two years and a reputation 
for a weak will, it was to his initiative that the 
State owed the movement to put an end to the 
practice of abandoning infants,by having the gov- 
ernment subsidize poor =) 
( Apparently there was no othér way of stopping 
this ruinous custom in a degenerate day. It was 
useless to appeal to the rich to rear families, and 
the poor who were still producing children were 
becoming poorer. One of Nerva’s noteworthy acts 
to alleviate conditions was the founding of colonies, 
and it was in accordance with the same general 
plan that, a few months before he died, he ordered 
that assistance should be given parents who found 
themselves without the means of bringing up their 
offspring. > 
(This order was issued in the year 97, and so 
successful was the experiment under his successor, 
1 Suetonius, Life of Claudius, par. 27. 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
    Politics and Children 231 
who accepted and enlarged the plan, that in the 
year 100, five thousand children were receiving aid 
from the State.} Much credit is given to Trajan 
for following up the ideas of Nerva, but it was to 
Nerva that Rome owed Trajan, one of the most 
humane of her emperors. ) 
( Another evidence of thé humanity of Nerva was 
the fact that he prohibited the making of eunuchs, 
a practice that had met with the disfavour of the 
Emperor Domitian years before, and a practice 
that led the Pope Clement XIV., to decree, cen- 
turies later, that no more castrats should sing in 
churches. And these things he did when the 
extravagance of his predecessors had made it 
necessary for him to sell the imperial furniture 
and jewels in order to replenish the treasury. 
One of his coins shows him seated in the curule 
chair, dispensing charity to a boy and girl, the 
mother_standing near, with the legend ‘‘Tutela 
Italia,”’ ) 
One need only to read the gentle replies of the 
Emperor Trajan to the younger Pliny, to see that, 
in that reign at least, there was a great change and 
that the conception of duty in the modern sense 
was creeping into a military world. Pliny himself, 
in a letter to Cannius, describes how he settled 
five hundred thousand sesterces (about $20,000) 
on the city of Como for the maintenance of chil- 
dren, ‘‘who were born of good families’’—an act as 
traceable to the growing protective tendency as to 
Pliny’s patriotism and love of glory. 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
  
  232 History of the Child 
According to the tablet of Velia* to the Emperor 
Trajan, the landed proprietors of the place received 
on mortgage at five per cent.,? less than half the 
usual rate of that time, what would be about $50,- 
000 of our money, the interest of which was to go 
to the maintenance of three hundred poor children. ) 
( The means employed to help parents and pre- 
vent them from exposing their children were 
skilfully contrived. Through the municipality, 
Trajan lent money to certain proprietors to im- 
prove their land, and the interest paid on this loan 
constituted a benevolent fund by which the chil- 
dren were taken care of, or rather, by which their 
parents were rewarded for not murdering them. 
From the table of Velia we learn also that fifty- 
one proprietors of that section received on land 
twelve times the value of the loan, or 1,116,000 
sesterces ($52,820) the annual interest of which, 
55,800 sesterces ($2,650), constituted a fund for 
the support of three hundred children, two hundred 
and sixty-four boys and thirty-six girls. The boys 
received annually 192 sesterces, and the girls 144 
sesterces. Illegitimate children were given less, 
the boys 144 sesterces, and the girls 120 sesterces, 
t Velia was a town in Liguria destroyed by a mountain slide. 
It was near the present town of Piacenza, about an hour’s railway 
ride from Milan. In 1747 the inscription was found, one of the 
longest that has come down to us, containing six hundred and 
thirty lines in seven columns. 
2 The usual rate in provinces was twelve per cent. Pliny, Epist., 
x., 62 (duodenis assibus). Later, Alex. Severus lent money to the 
poor to enable them to buy land at three per cent, 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
       New Attitude of Nerva 233 
although in the tablet there were only two illegiti- 
mate children, one boy and one girl. The fact that 
the number of girls assisted was only one-tenth the 
number of boys, goes to show, that this new insti- 
tution was not due so much to the fact that the 
sentiment of charity had infiltrated through pagan 
society, as to the fact that pagan society was 
endeavouring to repair the ravages of degenerate 
and pauperistic days, shown in the diminution of 
the class of freedmen in Rome.* 
(Writing to Pliny at Bithynia, to which place he 
had been sent by Trajan as imperial legate, the 
Emperor mildly answers an inquiry as to what the 
law shall be in that province regarding deserted 
children. Trajan rules that deserted children, who 
are found and brought up, shall be allowed their 
freedom without being obliged to repay the money 
expended for their maintenance. 
(“The question concerning Such children who 
were exposed by their parents,” says Trajan, 
“and afterward preserved by others, and edu- 
cated in a state of servitude, though born free, has 
been frequently discussed; but I do not find in the 
constitutions of the princes, my predecessors, any 
general regulation upon this head extending to all 
the provinces. There are, indeed, some rescripts 
of Domitian to Avidius Niguinus and Armenius 
Brocchus, which ought to be observed; but Bithy- 
nia is not comprehended in the provinces therein 
mentioned. I am of opinion, therefore, that the 
Tacitus, Ann., iv., 27. 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  234 History of the Child 
claims of those who assert their right of freedom 
upon this principle, should be allowed, without 
compelling them to purchase their liberty by re- 
paying the money advanced for their mainte- 
nance. ”’* 
A new note this, for in order to encourage the 
saving of children who had been exposed, the 
custom had been rigidly followed that the person 
who saved a child was able to regard it as his slave, 
without regard to what its condition had been 
previous to exposure. 
As shown in the correspondence of Pliny and 
Trajan, there is much truth, in the contention 
that the Emperor shows up better than the philo- 
sopher and poet. 
The noteworthy thing about this remarkable 
exchange of letters is that a new spirit is revealed. 
It is a living, working philosophy that we discover, 
practical results of that philosophy bringing a 
kindlier treatment of slaves, a greater respect for 
women, a more thoughtful regard for the education 
of the young, and_a gentler assistance of the help- 
less and distressed.) 
True, Cicero, a century and a half before had 
preached doctrines that paved the way, and for 
generations earlier there had been such a kindlier 
spirit in the air. But not until now do we find a 
man of Pliny’s dominating prominence, or near- 
ness to power, suggesting that he will pay a third 
of the expenses of the cost of founding a university 
t Pliny’s Letters, Letter 72, vol. ii. 
 
-P-A-G-E-299
  State Aid to Parents! 235 
in his own town. His reason, he says, is to save 
youths from going to Milan for their education 
and thereby getting away from the proper home 
influences. 
C Tracing the thin thread of child progress through 
these livid days we are brought in touch with the 
little known but better side of Roman life; for 
despite the general debauchery of the upper classes 
and the unwholesome pictures of Juvenal, there 
is evidence that there were Roman families un- 
touched by the general immorality where women 
of the type of Marcia or Helvia, addressed in the 
letters of Seneca, presided over homes in which 
there was an atmosphere of virtue and self-re- 
straint, and where tales of deeds of the Romans of 
the earlier days still had their charm and their 
influence. )

race enjoyed a state of prosperity equal 
to that under the reign of Hadrian, the 
successor to Trajan, and like him a philosopher 
among emperors. From Nerva to Marcus Aure- 
lius—the five emperors, Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, 
Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius—there was 
a reign of philosophy. Indeed they may also be 
called the emperors of the children for the reforms 
they accomplished and initiated—working as they 
did, contrary to the entire law and tradition of 
their country, and without the inspiration of com- 
plete knowledge of the intellectual and spiritual 
conditions that were governing them. ) 
To appreciate all that Hadrian did, one must 
remember that he had Plutarch for a master, 
Suetonius for his secretary, and. Phlegon, his freed- 
man, as amanuensis to write the history of his 
reign. As a youth he had studied all the philo- 
sophic systems including that of Epictetus, and

showed an acquisitive spirit. Had he lived in our 
age of private railway cars probably he would 
have spent little time at the Capitol: in a time 
when travel was both disagreeable and dangerous 
he journeyed back and forth over his great domain, 
to the dissatisfaction of the Romans, but to his 
own greater knowledge of his people and conse- 
quent greater humanitarianism. 
Out of that philosophy, that association, and 
that teaching, out of the character of Hadrian— 
for, despite the attempts of his biographers, Star- 
tianus and Dion Cassius, to make him a cruel and 
vain tyrant, his whole life shows an abhorrence of 
bloodshed—there was born a new rule.*) 
(He closed the ergastula, or workhouses, where 
so many men, carried off by surprise, were detained 
and tortured; he protected slaves against the 
cruelty and murderous punishments of masters, 
prohibiting their sale to houses of prostitution or 
schools for gladiators, and also declaring against 
the indiscriminate torture of slaves whose masters 
had been assassinated. Up to that time even 
those who had not been within sight or hearing of 
a murder were liable to punishment. A woman 
who had ill-treated her female slaves he sentenced 
to five years’ imprisonment—an unheard-of thing 
in those days.) 
(Once before, during the reign of Tiberius, Car--— 
thaginian priests had been crucified by the Em- 
peror for the sacrifice of children to their god 
1 Tertullian, Epst., 9. 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
  238 History of the Child 
Moloch, but apparently the punishment had not 
acted as a deterrent, for we find a similar provision 
in the laws of Hadrian.) 
Going further and, as Duruy says, ‘‘employing 
logic in the service of humanity,” he ruled that 
any woman who had been free at the time of 
pregnancy must naturally give birth to a free child, 
a ruling not important in itself but closely in 
touch with what we will come to see was the argu- 
ment of the Christian Fathers in behalf of the lives 
of little children, ) 
He ameliorated the condition of women, allow- 
ing them to make wills, and for the first time 
softened the law of the Twelve Tables which, 
according to Ulpian, had given a mother no rights 
in the property of a son dying intestate. Hadrian, 
however, following a senatus consultum Tertulli- 
anum, gave the mother, under the jus trium lib- 
erorum, the right to inherit when she had had three 
sons, and, if a freed woman, when she had had 
four.) , 
(But the great blow Hadrian struck at the theo- 
ries that had hitherto held sway was the con- 
demning to banishment a father who had killed 
his son. From time immemorial the boast of 
Rome had been fathers who, in the ardour of patri- 
otism, and sometimes in the heat of anger or re- 
sentment, had sacrificed their sons, no matter how 
famous or important their sons were? 
‘Lucius Brutus,” says Valerius Maximus, giving 
suitable incidents of the father’s power, ‘“‘who

equalled Romulus in honour, for he founded Rome 
and thus the Roman liberty, coming to the su- 
preme power, and understanding that his sons 
endeavoured to restore Tarquin, caused them to 
be apprehended, and to be whipped with rods 
before the Tribuna; and, after that, caused them 
to be tied to a stake, and then ordered the sergeant 
to cut off their heads. He put off the relation of a 
father, that he might act like a consul; rather 
chose to live childless, than to be remiss in public 
duty. } 
‘Cassius, following his example, though his 
son was a tribune of the people, and was the first 
that had promulgated the Agrarian law, and by 
many other popular acts had won the hearts of the 
people, when he had laid down his command, by 
advice of his kindred and friends, condemned him 
in his own house for affecting the kingdom; and 
after he was whipped, commanded him to be,put 
to-death; and consecrated his estate to Ceres.) 
(“Titus Manlius Torquatus, famous for his 
many great dignities, and a person of rare experi- 
ence in the civil law and the pontifical ceremonies, 
did not think it necessary to consult his friends 
in an act of the same nature. For when the Mace- 
donians had by their ambassadors complained to 
the Senate of D. Silanus, his son, who was gover- 
nor of that province, he besought the Senate 
that they would determine nothing in that affair 
till he had heard the difference betwixt his son 
and the Macedonians. Then, with the general 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
  240 History of the Child 
consent of the conscript fathers, and of them that 
came to complain, he sat and heard the cause in 
his own house, wherein he spent two whole days 
alone, and the third day, after he had diligently 
examined the testimonies on both sides, he pro- 
nounced this sentence: ‘Whereas it hath been 
proved that Silanus, my son, has taken money of 
our allies, I think him unworthy to live either in 
the commonwealth, or in my house, and I command 
him forthwith to get out of my sight.’ Silanus, 
struck with the sharp and cruel sentence of his 
father, would not endure to live any longer, but 
the next night hanged himself. ) 
“But M. Scaurus, the light and ornament of 
his country, when the Roman cavalry was worsted 
by the Cimbrians and deserting the proconsul, 
Catullus, took their flight toward the city, sent 
one to tell his son, who was one of thosé that fled,

away. For he caused his son, eminent among his 
equals for his wit, learning, and beauty, to be put 
to death because he took part with Catiline, being 
seduced by ill-counsel; having brought him back 
by force, as he was going to Catiline’s army, and 
uttering these words before his death, that he ‘did 
not beget him to join with Catiline against his 
country, but to serve his country against Catiline.’ 
He might have kept him till the heat of the war 
had been over, but that would have been only the 
act of a cautious, this was the deed of a severe 
father.” 
(The father who was brought before Hadrian 
under the old conditions would have been honoured 
—he had killed a son who befouled his name. 
Nevertheless this man was ordered to be deported, 
“because he had killed as a thief rather than as 
one using the power (jure) of father; nam patria 
potestas in pietate debet, non atrociate consistere.”’* 
Whatever the excuse given, he was punished. 
That he had not observed the forms in killing his 
son by calling a consultation of the members of 
his family, was the nominal reason for punishing 
him, but the unchecked power of the father over 
the life of his children, even when they had become 
adults, was ended.)

lished for the exposure of children. But advance 
it was when no longer were children left in unfre- 
quented highways, no longer were they thrown 
into the Tiber,) E 
( ‘There were two places where it was the custom to 
leave abandoned children. One was near the Vela- 
brum, a street on the western slope of the Aven- 
tine Hill between the Vicus Tuscus and the Forum 
Boarium where the oil dealers and the cheese 
mongers made a practice of selling their wares; 
and the other, in the vegetable market, where 
there rose a column round which the children 
were placed.| Because of this practice, according 
to Festus, ie column was called the Lactaria.* 
It was said that courtesans favoured the Velabrum, ) 
(What happened to the children even in this 
“advanced”’ age was doubtless little different 
from the treatment they received when they were 
found on the highways. The elder Seneca has 
given a vivid account of the practice of the day in 
the ‘‘Thirty-third Controversy,” book five, headed 
“Debilitans Expositos.”’? 
\ Difficult as it is to believe that the people who 
eventually charged themselves with the rearing 
of the foundlings made a business of mutilating 
them, there is no doubt but that such was the case. 
In the “Controversy” of Seneca the question is

-P-A-G-E-311
    Mutilation for Profit 243 
whether those who mutilated exposed children 
have done a wrong toward the State. The debate 
is opened by Porcius Latro, who asks if after 
having suffered the misfortune of being exposed, 
it is not a piece of good luck to have someone 
find them. 
Cassius Severus then expresses his opinion. 
“Look,” he exclaims, ‘‘on the blind wandering 
about the streets leaning on their sticks, and on 
those with crushed feet, and still again look on 
those with broken limbs. This one is without 
arms, that one has had his shoulders pulled down 
out of shape in order that his grotesqueries may 
excite laughter. Let us view the entire miserable 
family shivering, trembling, blind, mutilated, 
perishing from hunger—in fact, already half dead. 
Let us go to the origin of all these ills—a laboratory 
for the manufacture of human wrecks—a cavern 
filled with the limbs torn from living children— 
each has a different profession, a different mutila- 
tion has given each a different occupation.” 
The conclusion is that inasmuch as the exposed 
children are slaves, being the property of those 
who rear them, they have no cause for complaint 
against the State. 
“What wrong has been done to the Republic?” 
asks Gallio in reply to Severus. ‘‘On the con- 
trary, have not these children been done a service 
inasmuch as their parents had cast them out?” 
(“Many individuals,” adds F. Claudius, ‘‘rid 
themselves of misformed children defective in some

born under evil auspices. Someone else picks 
them up out of commiseration and, in order to

ing event of Hadrian’s reign is the fact 
that the opinions of the jurists, when they 
were unanimous, were now recognized as written 
law.* The constitutions or proclamations of law 
of the emperors, although none were ascribed to 
an earlier date, had probably been issued for a 
century previously, but now what is called the 
“Perpetual Edict” is finally arranged and author- 
ized, and law proceeds from an intellectual and 
philosophic source, instead of from an imperial 
head. 
In empowering Salvius Julianus, one of the 
four greatest lawyers Rome ever produced, to 
frame an edict, and by a senatus consultum em- 
body this edict in the statute law of Rome, the 
entire law of the Empire underwent a change in 
spirit. What had hitherto been done by Augustus, 
by Nerva, by Trajan, and by Hadrian himself, Pte the strictly legal side the most interest-

had furnished only the value of example or of an 
immediate law passed for the benefit of some par- 
ticular condition. A succeeding emperor was at 
liberty to imitate or pass similar laws, or ignore 
the acts of his predecessors as he might choose. 
As we shall see, he usually ignored the noble ex- 
amples of those who had gone before. 
( But by placing the making of the law in the 
hands of the jurists, men who were thinkers and 
scholars and under the influence of the spreading 
Stoic philosophy, many disciples of Zeno and 
Chrysippus, and some later to be under the influ- 
ence of the Christian philosophy, Hadrian was 
laying a broad foundation for the complete passing 
of the Roman idea of the unimportance of the 
child as a child, and making way for the Christian 
idea which was to take its place.) 
. By a senatus consultum, passed before the Edict 
of Julianus, the right of fathers to expose their 
children was for the first time taken away; durante 
matrimonio they were compelled to rear their 
children instead of exposing them, while later 
regulations made it necessary to maintain even 
those children born after divorce.* 
This was the first attempt to prohibit the ex- 
posing of children) 
As we have seén, the right of the father to reject 
his offspring was restricted in earliest times to 
weak and deformed children, and then only after 
there had been a conference with five neighbours, 
1 Julianus, 611; Walker, p. 77. 
 
-P-A-G-E-315
  Code of Justinian 247 
but the frequent reference to the exposure of child- 
ren under the Republic and under the emperors 
indicates that there was little regard for this legal 
restraint. Even Augustus himself did not hesitate 
to_expose the child of his granddaughter. ) 
(The law of Hadrian has not been placed by 
scholars and commentators as the first law against 
exposing children, partly no doubt because it was 
too new to be really effective. In an interesting 
controversy* between Gerardus Noodt and Cor- 
nelius Van Binkershoek, as to whether there were 
any prohibitory laws prior to those of Valentinian, 
Valens, and Gratian (367 A.D.), Binkershoek main- 
tains with great show of authority, what is un- 
doubtedly true, that there were. Interesting, too, 
is the fact that we find in the Code of Justinian 
(vii., 16, 1) reference to a rescript of Hadrian in 
which the sale of children is referred to as ‘‘res 
dlicita et inhonesta,” which is assumed by Walker 
to refer to the sales not being properly conducted, ? 
but which, judging from the temper of the Emperor, 
referred to the thing itself.) 
_As the war-loving Trajan was succeeded by the 
lover of peace, the nomadic Hadrian was succeeded 
by the home-loving Antoninus Pius, who did not 
leave Rome for almost a quarter of a century, 
except for one rapid tour through Asia. He made

it possible for children to inherit from their parents 
even though they had neglected to imitate a 
father in becoming a Roman citizen. He further 
showed his humanity by compelling cruel masters 
to-sell slaves they had maltreated. ) 
( In the name of his wife, Faustina, for whom— 
despite the assaults on her character—he retained 
ever affection and respect, he consecrated a pro- 
tective foundation for the benefit of girls, puelle 
alimentarie Faustiniane—the first of its kind in the 
world, and the initial move to save female children 
other than the first-born. A medal of the time, 
showing the Empress, bears on the reverse side 
Antoninus surrounded by children, with the words 
Puelle Faustiniane in the exergue.t This, together 
with his continuous support of the pueri alimentarii, 
entitles him to the credit of saving more children 
from the ‘‘ancient and abominable’? custom of 
being thrown out on the crossroads to die than 
any of his predecessors. ) 
( At the end of his réign it is evident from the 
inscriptions that endowments similar to those 
originated by Nerva had been made at Atina, 
Abellinum, Abella, Vibo, Caieta, Anagnia, Fundi, 
Cupra Montana, Industria, Brixia, Aquileia, 
Compsa, Aiclanum, Allifee, Aufidena, Cures, Auxi- 
mum, and other places. What is more interesting 
than the point of view of E. E. Bryant, in his 
Life of Antoninus Pius, that these ‘‘endowments 
undoubtedly pauperized Italians and lightened

unwisely the responsibility of parents for the 
maintenance of their children? But they must 
certainly have been of assistance to farmers, and have 
supplied them with the capital necessary for 
successful agriculture.”’* / 
( The progress made in the matter of child history 
would be incomplete if one did not recall that in 
this reign appeared that bold and able defender 
of Christianity, Justin Martyr. The time had 
gone by for darkness and seclusion, and now, that 
which had been contemptuously but so well de- 
scribed as the religion of ‘‘slaves and women, of 
children and old men,” strode abroad, proclaiming 
its right to be heard as a rational and uplifting 
doctrine. Pleading for the oppressed and the 
downtrodden, pleading for those the Roman world 
affected to despise, preaching a religion of humility 
—there is a fine, robust, masculine note in Justin’s 
opening words of his apology, the challenging 
conviction of a man who knowingly throws down 
the gauntlet to the masters of the world. )

It was during the reign of Antoninus that Ter- 
tullian was born. 
(Under Antoninus’s philosophic successor the 
alimentary institution was further developed, 
Marcus Aurelius showing his interest by putting 
the supervision under a person of pretorian or 
consular rank. He upheld the rights of children, 
going one step further in the direction of freedom 
by ‘ending the tyrannical power of the father to 
oblige his son to put away his wife, if the latter 
were disagreeable to the head of the family.) 
(With Marcus Aurelius vanished the humane 
emperors—they had reigned long. Culminating 
in his beneficent sway the Stoic philosophy, from 
Aristotle to Marcus Aurelius, kept developing, 
in the midst of surroundings the least encouraging. 
The Stoics, with their ideas of humanity, of mutual 
good will and moral equality, arrived at almost 
the same conclusions regarding religion and the 
same sentiment regarding humanity as did the 
followers of the Christian religion, although work- 
ing from an entirely different source. The one 
reached its conclusion through the medium of 
patrician orators, philosophers, and emperors, 
+ Duruy, vol. v., p. 467. E.E. Bryant, Life of Antoninus Pius, 
p. 122, refers to the inscription at Aquileia of a “‘ prefectus

the other through the slaves, the distressed, and 
those for whom life faced an unbroken wall.) 
(From Aurelius to Septimus Severus there is 
little but bloodshed in Roman history. The selec- 
tion of Papinian, the greatest of Roman jurists, 
as his adviser is in a way the greatest claim to fame 
that Severus has.t Among his many laws was 
one that permitted the sons of a condemned crimi- 
nal to retain the rights the father had over freed- 
men, which was considered a great indulgence 
—benignissime rescripsit. He condemned to tem- 
porary exile the woman who, by practising abor- 
tion, had deprived her husband of the hope of 
children. ) 
C Of thé bloody reign of Caracalla it is to be noted 
principally that he changed the lex Julia in such 
a way as to deprive paternity of its privileges. 
Those who were not married (celebs) and those 
who were married and had no children (orbus) 
suffered in regard to their inheritances as they 
had under the old law, but Caracalla filled his 
treasury by sweeping into the fiscus all the caduca. _) 
( While the barbarians are now beginning to press 
down on the northern frontiers of the Empire and 
the Christians beginning to rapidly and swiftly 
permeate the vast domain, there is little but a 
bloody chronicle of making and unmaking of em- 
perors up to Diocletian. Even when persecuted 
and proscribed, says Ortolan, Christianity had a 
liberalizing and softening effect on the progress of 
« Hunter, p. 68. 
 
-P-A-G-E-320
  252 History of the Child 
jurisprudence and legislation. The softening effect 
was also the effect of a new understanding. Tra- 
jan, one of the greatest of the humane emperors, 
had come from Spain, and Diocletian, who tem- 
porarily braced up the Roman legions, put energy 
) into the government, and held the barbarians in 
check, was himself from a family of freedmen. 
The best of the patrician blood had become thor- 
oughly impregnated with Stoic ideas, although it 
was true that the jurists who had obtained their 
philosophy from Greece and were given the task 
of defending existing law and institutions were 
still against the new religion. Though the perse- 
cutors under Diocletian were unusually severe, 
theirs was the final burst of oppression before 
the new religion was to triumph in having the 
head of the great Roman Empire, Diocletian’s 
own successor, Constantine, accept the despised 
faith. 
It matters little whether Constantine’s conver- 
sion was a political move, based on a desire to 
absorb a growing and powerful organization. 
This was a century in which things were happen- 
ing and his was a reign (306 or 313-337) that 
marked a long turn in the road in the attitude of 
the State toward the child. Despite the progress 
that had been made, the practice of murdering 
and exposing new-born children was becoming 
more and more frequent in the provinces, and 
especially in Italy." )

(elt was due to poverty, says Gibbon,’ and the 
principal causes of distress were the unendurable 
taxes. The historian declares that ‘‘moved by 
some recent and extraordinary instances of de- 
spair,’’ Constantine addressed an edict? to all the 
cities of Italy and afterward to those of Africa, 
directing that immediate and sufficient aid be 
given by magistrates to parents who produced 
children that they were too poor to bring up. 
Against the opinion of Gibbon is set that of Gode- 
froy that it was not some unusual bit of misery, 
some ‘‘Mary Ellen case,” that moved the Emperor 
to take this significant step. >) 
The edict was published on May 12, 315 A.D., 
a few months before his victory over Licinius. 
The Christians had prophesied to Constantine 
that he would be victorious and he was more than 
likely to be influenced by their point of view, espe- 
cially that of Lactantius, the noted rhetorician 
and teacher, to whom he had entrusted the educa- 
tion of his son, Crispus. Lactantius had just 
written his work on The Divine Institutes, designed 
to supersede the less complete treatises of Minu- 
cius Felix, Tertullian, and Cyprian. He had dedi- 
cated the work to Constantine, and perhaps had 
conversed with him about it, discussing one par- 
ticular chapter in which the Christian Father had 
inveighed, with his accustomed grace but with 
tZosimus, book ii., says parents were obliged to sell their 
children to pay the tax collectors.

unusual force, against infanticide and the sale 
and exposure of infants. A new day, indeed, had 
come—the proud Emperor of the mighty Romans 
sits high on his throne, listening to, and moved by 
—a Christian Father! 
This is Lactantius’s plea for the new-born, from 
the sixth book of his Divine Institutes*: 
( ‘‘Therefore let no one imagine that even this 
is allowed, to strangle newly born children, which 
is the greatest impiety; for God breathes into their 
souls for life, and not for death. But men, that 
there may be no crime with which they may not 
pollute their hands, deprive souls, as yet innocent 
and simple, of the light which they themselves 
have not given. Any one truly may not expect 
that they would abstain from the blood of others 
who do not abstain even from their own. But 
these are without any controversy wicked and 
unjust. What are they whom a false piety com- 
pels to expose their children? Can they be con- 
sidered innocent who expose their own offspring 
as a prey to dogs, and as far as it depends upon 
themselves, kill them in a more cruel manner than 
if they had strangled them? / 
\“Who can doubt that he is impious who gives 
occasion for the pity of others? For, although 
that which he has wished should befall the child 
—namely, that it should be brought up—he has 
certainly consigned his own offspring either to 
servitude or to the brothel? But who does not

-P-A-G-E-323
   Plea of Lactantius 255 
understand, who is ignorant what things may 
happen, or are accustomed to happen, in the case 
of each sex, even through error? For this is 
shown by the example of Gdipus alone, confused 
with twofold guilt. It is therefore as wicked to 
expose as it is to kill. But truly parricides com- 
plain of the scantiness of their means, and allege 
that they have not enough for bringing up more 
children; as though, in truth, their means were in 
the power of those who possess them, or God did 
not daily make the rich poor, and the poor rich. 
Wherefore, if any one on account of poverty shall 
be unable to bring up children, it is better to 
abstain from marriage than with wicked hands to 
mar the work of God.” ) 
As an additional protective measure Constantine 
withdrew the right of liberty that the Antonines 
had secured to foundling children, and in order 
to encourage strangers to pick up waifs cast away 
by parents, the Emperor made them the slaves 
of those who raised them. The father was pun- 
ished for rejecting his infant by being no longer 
able to claim a right that had previously been his. 
Rather than that there should be murder, the 
Emperor went further; he gave poor parents the 
right to sell their new-born children. ) 
“One more step and the story of the Roman child 
ends. The Emperor Valentinian, a strange mixture 
of cruelty and sense—the same who kept two 
ferocious she-bears near him and saw that they 
had human food a-plenty,—is in the books as the

new-born infants. It was in 374 that this edict 
was issued in thename of the Emperors Valentinian, 
Valens, and Gratian, declaring that whosoever 
should expose his children should be subject to 
punishment. *

  CHAPTER XVIII 
PLEAS OF THE CHRISTIAN FATHERS. 
T has been said that the only way to understand 
| the Middle Ages is to comprehend that the 
Roman Empire did not die down, or fade 
away; it remained, or continued to be the centre 
of civilized government, until comparatively re- 
cent times. Un fact, nominally the Holy Roman 
Empire, the directdescendant of the Roman 
Empire, did not pass away as an idea until 1806, 
when the Emperor Joseph II. announced to the 
Germanic Diet his refusal to carry any longer the 
title of Emperor of the Romans.2) 
Even when the Roman Empire was at its great- 
est point of power and wealth, the actual founders 
of the Holy Roman Empire were at work in Rome 
itself, in the persons of the Christian Fathers; for, 
after all, it was the Church that was to rule the 
world once swayed by Roman legions. (The men 
who, as representatives of Christ, were later to 
tame the barbarians, really laid the foundations 
for the future greatness of Christian Rome, amid

   the very luxury and opulence of the pagan Rome 
soon to pass away. 
The struggles of these Christians among the 
polished and cruel Romans was, in a way, a pre- 
paration for the struggle to come later with the 
unpolished, but equally cruel, barbarians. In 
their conquest of the Roman world, the Christian 
founders saved their religion; in the conquest of the 
barbarian hordes, they saved civilization; without 
Christianity the German and Celtic races, with 
their lustful, revengeful, and passionate natures, 
either might have overwhelmed Roman civiliza- 
tion entirely, bringing on a night of barbarism, or 
have been themselves ‘“‘corrupted and destroyed by 
the vices and sensuality which surrounded them.”? 
_ Amid all the differences of opinion and doctrine 
that we find among the early founders of Christian- 
ity, there was one thing on which they were unan- 
imous, and that was the attitude toward children. 
It was a ceaseless war they waged in behalf of 
children—those early and ofttimes eloquent found- 
ers. From Barnabas, contemporary of the Apos- 
tles, and by Luke even called one of them, to 
Ambrosius and Augustine, they did not cease to 
denounce those who, no matter what their reasons, 
exposed or killed infants. _) 
( No distinction was made by the Fathers between 
infanticide and exposure.? Both were murder- 
ous acts, particularly bitterly condemned by the

Christians because their enemies had charged them 
with murdering infants at secret rites. The letter 
attributed to Barnabas by Clement of Alexandria 
and Origen, and which in any case goes back to the 
earliest days of the religion, severely condemned 
infanticide. ‘‘Thou shalt not slay the child by 
procuring abortion, nor again shalt thou destroy 
it after it is born.”* By such protests as these, 
made with one cannot tell what frequency, the 
Christians took their stand on the basic principles.) 
Justin, whose vigorous manner of addressing 
the Emperor is so attractive, succumbed, at the 
age of seventy-four, to the calumnies of the cynic 
Crescentius, and became a martyr; but his example 
and fervour left an indelible mark upon his time. 
CAs for us,” he says, “‘we have been taught that 
to expose newly born children is the part of 
wicked men; and this we have been taught lest 
we should do any one an injury, and lest we should 
sin against God; first, because we see that almost 
all so exposed (not only the girls, but also the 
males) are brought up to prostitution. .. . Now 
we see you rear children only for this shameful 
use; and for this pollution a multitude of females 
and hermaphrodites, and those who commit un- 
mentionable iniquities are found in every nation. 
And you receive the hire of these, and duty and 
taxes from them, whom you ought to exterminate 
from your realm.’’? )

(And again he says: ‘‘We fear to expose child- 
ren, lest some of them be not picked up, but die, 
and we become murderers. But whether we 
marry, it is only that we may bring up children; 
or whether we decline marriage, we live conti- 
nently.”* ) 
Athanagoras,* the Athenian philosopher, who 
presented to Marcus Aurelius and to Commodus 
an apology for the Christians, in 166 A.D., asked 
the logical Romans to use their famous common 
sense in weighing false charges made against 
Christians. 
_ “What man of sound mind,” he said, ‘‘will 
affirm that we, who abhor murder, are murderers; 
we who condemn as murder the use of drugs for 
abortion, and declare that those who even expose 
a child are chargeable with murder.’’) 
Tertullian, whose apology was written in the 
year 200, or 205, of our era, was equally bold. 
“Rulers of the Roman Empire,” he began, 
“seated for the administration of justice on your 
lofty tribunal ’’—and then made the charge direct: 
“You first of all expose your children, that they 
may be taken up by any compassionate passer-by, 
to whom they are quite unknown; or you give 
them away to be adopted by those who will act 
better to them the part of parents.” ¢)

  Vision of Paul 261 
Later, in another address, this time to the pagan 
people, he returns to the charges. 
€ ‘Although you are forbidden by the laws to 
slay new-born infants, it so happens that no laws 
are evaded with more impunity or greater safety, 
with the deliberate knowledge of the public and 
the suffrages of this entire age, .. . You make 
away with them in a more cruel manner, because 
you expose them to cold and hunger, and to wild 
beasts, or else you get rid of them by the slower 
death of drowning [sic].’’* 
““Man is more cruel to his offspring than ani- 
mals,” “said the learned Clement of Alexandria. 
“Orpheus tamed the tiger by his songs, but the 
God of the Christians, in calling men to their true 
religion, did more, since he tamed and softened 
the most ferocious of all animals—men them- 
selves.’’? ) 
No abler pleader for the new order of things 
was there than Minucius Felix, a Roman lawyer 
of education, who, on his conversion to the new 
faith, became one of the eloquent founders of 
Latin Christianity. A disciple of Cicero, he has 
been called the “precursor of Lactantius in the 
graces of style.” 
( ‘How I should like to meet him,” he exclaims, 
indignantly, ‘“‘who says or believes that we are 
initiated by the slaughter and blood of an infant

dare do it. And I see that you at one time ex- 
posed your begotten children to wild beasts and 
to birds; and another, that you crush them when 
strangled with a miserable kind of death... 
and these things assuredly come down from the 
teachings of your gods. For Saturn did not expose 
his children, but devoured them. With reason 
were infants sacrificed to him by parents in some 
part of Africa, caresses and kisses repressing their 
crying, that a weeping victim might not be sacri- 
ficed. Moreover, among the Tauri of Pontus, 
and to the Egyptian Busiris, it was a sacred rite 
to immolate their guests, and for the Galli to 
slaughter to Mercury human, or rather inhuman, 
sacrifices. The Roman sacrificers buried living 
a Greek man and a Greek woman, a Gallic man 
and a Gallic woman; and to this day, Jupiter 
Latiaris is worshipped by them with murder; 
and, what is worthy of the son of Saturn, he is 
gorged with the blood of an evil and criminal 
man.”’* a 
CTo dfive home the awful character of a crime 
that was so common we have the vision of Paul, 
who sees the man and woman who have exposed 
children, suffering in hell the terrible tortures of 
the damned) ) 
“They [the parents] gave us for food to dogs 
and to be turned out to swine. Some of us they 
threw into the river,’ exclaimed these children; 
“and so now the guilty are condemned to eternal

punishment while the children are committed to 
the angels.”* ) 
(We have quoted already the eloquent Lactan- 
tius. Basil the Great thundered against infanti- 
cide and the spectacle of free children being sold 
by avaricious creditors of their fathers. The 
same Ambrosius, who, although only a Christian 
Bishop, castigated the Emperor Theodosius for 
the massacre at Thessalonica, brought his force 
and courage to play against the law which per- 
mitted a debtor to satisfy his claim, at the cost 
of the liberty of his son, or the debauchery of his 
daughter, as the fisc was then authorized to sell 
infants to pay unsatisfied taxes. ) 
(A new religion in one of the least important 
ee of the Roman Empire, Christianity, in 
three centuries, pushed its doctrines to the very 
end of the vast Roman domain, and even made the 
conquest of the imperial throne itself. 
( Its impassioned preachers and apostles vaunted 
the humanity of their new faith; for cast-out in- 
fants and the despised slaves the new priests 
fought such a battle of perseverance and martyr- 
dom as the world had never seen before. » 
(In the name of their new God, Jesus, himself 
admittedly a poor Jew and a carpenter, they took 
all the truth there was in the aristocratic philo- 
sophy of the Romans and their emperors, and 
made it live indeed—they applied it to the lowest, 
and the most humble—even to children. ‘‘No-

children had souls, to which religious doctrine 
probably more is due in the way of checking the 
practice of infanticide than any other single idea. 
We have seen how Plutarch, the polished philo- 
sopher, had gone as far as the pagan mind could 
under its philosophy, in directing thought as 
to man’s responsibility for actions toward the 
child, by collecting opinions of the philosophers 
as to when an unborn child became a human 
being. 
The Fathers won the battle in that they con- 
vinced the Roman world that children had souls 
—but the economic battle was one not yet to be 
won by preaching. But it was not by orations and 
preaching alone that they had won as much as 
they had. 
Constantine, in the year 315, as we have seen, 
had put forth the proclamation: 
_ “Let a law be at once promulgated in all the 
towns of Italy, to turn parents from using a par- 
ricidal hand on their new-born children, and to 
dispose their hearts to the best sentiments. Watch 
with care over this, that, if a father brings his 
child, saying that he cannot support it, someone 
should supply him without delay with food and 
clothing; for the cares of the new-born suffer no 
 
-P-A-G-E-335
    Law of Constantine 265 
delay, and we order that our revenue, as well as 
our treasure, aid in this expense.’’* 
To this he added, in 321, including the provinces: 
“We have learned that the inhabitants of pro- 
vinces, suffering from scarcity of food, sell and put 
in pledge their children. We command then that 
those found in this situation, without any personal 
resource, and being able only with great trouble 
to support their children, be succoured by our 
treasury before they fall under the blows of pov- 
erty; for it is repugnant to our morals that any 
one under our Empire should be pushed by hunger 
to commit a crime.’’? 
(Ten years later, Constantine had to modify 
the laws in relation to children—so acute were 
the sufferings in the Empire—by permitting those 
who ‘‘took up” children to have the right of 
property in them.: ) 
“Whoever,” said Constantine in his latest law, 
“has taken in a new-born boy or girl, exposed by 
the order and with the knowledge of its father or 
master, outside of the house of the one or the other, 
has the power to keep him as son or slave without 
fear that those who rejected him can reclaim him.” 
The conditions of the times, as Dugour points 
out, are well shown by the frequency with which 
these conditions are referred to. Julius Firmicus, 
an astrologer of the fourth century, devotes a 
* Codex Theodosianus, xi., xxvii., 1.

chapter of his work to revealing combinations of 
planets that will tell what will be the fate of the 
child that is exposed. Under certain signs the 
child will perish through lack of food; under others 
it will drown; under still another it will be eaten 
by dogs, and another combination indicated that 
it would find a saviour and a second father. 
( In 374, the Emperors Valentinian, Valens, and 
Gratian declared that the exposure of all infants 
was punishable, and ordered that parents see to 
it that their children were fed. The main ques- 
tion that seemed to agitate both the Empire of 
the East and the Empire of the West was that of 
the rights of the adoptive parent, as against those 
who owned the land where the child had been 
abandoned. 
“Let men look to it that they nourish their 
children. If they expose them, they may be 
punished in conformity with the law. If other 
persons take the children up they cannot be re- 
claimed; as people cannot take again children 
they have wilfully permitted to perish.”’) 
In 391, Valentinian, Theodosius, and Arcadius 
permitted, by other law, the child sold by its 
father to become a free man after a short term of 
servitude, without reimbursing a master.? 
In 409, Honorius and Theodosius issued an 
edict in favour of Romans sold to other Romans, 
limiting the period of slavery to five years. Never- 
theless, in 412, Honorius and Theodosius confirmed 
* Codex Theodosianus, chapter iii., title 3. 
   
-P-A-G-E-337
  Rights of Adoptive Parents 267 
the law of Constantine concerning the sale of 
infants purchased or taken up with the knowledge 
of the bishop of the diocese. 
An edict of the emperors maintained the rights 
of the adoptive parents. ' The right of the latter 
to their property was also confirmed in cases 
where the parent or master willingly and know- 
ingly had allowed the child to be exposed. 
Another imperial edict ordered that no new- 
born could be taken from the place where it had 
been found without the presence of witnesses. 
A form was drawn up which was to be signed by 
the bishop. 
In 438, these regulations were collected by 
Theodosius the Second under the Code that bears 
his name. 
In 451, Valentinian the Third declared that the 
“nutritor, or person who had taken up the child, 
should receive an indemnity, independent of the 
years of service, and fixed the price to be paid him. 
The Emperor also declared that those who had 
sold children to barbarians, or who had purchased 
a free person for the purpose of transporting him 
across seas, should be_ compelled to pay to the 
fisc, six ounces of gold.*) 
Following the preachings of the Fathers, and 
supplementing and strengthening the laws of the 
Empire, the Church at various councils, called 
always for some other purpose, took action and 
frequently condemned the loose morals of the day. 
* Codex Theodosianus.

  268 History of the Child 
Not orations, nor apologies and pleas alone, 
says Labourt, would have brought about the new 
point of view among people so hard pressed and 
so thoroughly imbued with the ideas of another 
civilization. At the Council of Ancyra, the mod- 
ern city of Angora, in the year 314, it was decreed 
that the woman guilty of killing her offspring 
should be punished by being forbidden to enter 
a church for the rest of her life, a terrible punish- 
ment in those days. 
At the Council of Elvira, the first one held in 
Spain, by some held to have met before 250, but 
by Tillemont placed in the year 300, a decree 
limited the period of retribution to ten years, of 
which two were to be passed in weeping, at the 
end of which time the recreant mother could 
receive the sacraments. 
( At a Council in 546, the period of penitence 
was reduced to seven years. At the Council of 
Constantinople, in 588, or 592, the crime was 
compared to homicide, and finally Sixtus Quintus 
and Gregory the Fourteenth stated that the 
culprits should suffer capital punishmen: 
At the Council of Nicaea, in 325,—the famous 
council at which a controversy between Bishop 
Arius and Bishop Athanasius was “‘settled,”’ with 
the result that Arius was declared a heretic,—it was 
prescribed, in Article Seventy of its conclusions, 
that in each village of the Christian world there 
should be established an asylum, under the name 
of the Xenodocheion, the object of which was to 
   
-P-A-G-E-339
  Decrees of Church Councils 269 
assist voyageurs, the sick, and the poor. Without 
doubt, as Labourt suggests, these places became 
asylums for abandoned children., 
(The question of the property right was one that 
the Church had to face in the Council of Vaison, 
in 442. Frequently after charitable strangers” 
had taken children off the highways, educated 
them, and brought them up, their parents or their 
owners would demand their return. It was a 
vital question of the day: to whom did these 
children belong? ) 
(The Emperor Constantine had declared that 
those who received them had a right to them and 
the Emperor Honorius had added the restriction 
that the Church must know of the adoption. 
Many were the arguments and the legal battles 
that ensued, during which time people were little 
inclined to rescue the abandoned infants and 
many perished as victims of the voracity of dogs, 
many as the victims of hunger and cold.*) 
These conditions were presented to the Council, 
which ordered the following measures: 
(‘‘Whoever takes up an abandoned child shall 
bring him to the Church where that fact will be 
certified. The following Sunday the priest will 
announce that a new-born child has been found 
and ten days will be allowed to the real parents 
to claim their infant. When these formalities 
have been complied with, if any one then claims 
a child or in any way calumniates those who have

  270 History of the Child 
received it, he will be punished_according to the 
Church laws against homicide.” ') 
Ten years later the act of the Council of Vaison 
was sanctioned at the Council of Arles and again 
in 505, by the Council of Agde. 
( It has been said that this was comparatively 
little when one thinks of this great union of bishops 
representing not only the interests of religion but 
“the moral needs of the epoch.’’ On the other 
hand, any criticism would be unjust that did not 
take into consideration the fact that it was great 
progress in_the face of great poverty and greater 
barbarity.? ) 
Church and State united in the movement for 
the protection of the child in the laws of Justinian, 
who, raised to the throne in 527, published in 529, 
and with considerable changes in 534, a collection 
of laws that have immortalized his name, in which 
the great lawyer Tribonian remade the three other 
codes, the Gregorian, Hermogenian, and the 
Theodosian, 
| Justinian proclaimed absolute liberty for found- 
ling children, declaring that they were not the 
property of either the parents who exposed them 
or of those who received them.) 
One of these laws, promulgated in 553, punished 
severely those who tried to hold as slaves, children 
who had been exposed. This law stated expressly 
t Acta Conciliorum Paristis, 1715. Tomei.,p.1789. Chapters 
Concilium Vasense, Anno Christi 442, chapters 9 and 10.

    Laws of Justinian 271 
that all children left at churches or other places 
were absolutely free. It also stated that the act 
of exposing a child exceeded the cruelty of an 
ordinary murder, inasmuch as it struck at the 
most feeble and the most pitiable. ) 
The imperial edict of 553 invited the Archbishop 
of Thessalonica and the prefect to give to the 
foundlings all the help possible and to punish those 
who disobeyed the injunction with a fine of five 
livres of gold. In addition, the Justinian Code 
contained a provision by which a father whose 
poverty was extreme was allowed to sell his son 
or his daughter at the moment of birth and to 
repurchase the infant later. The Emperor also 
ordered that some organized endeavour be made 
to take care of children for whom no other provi- 
sion had been made. Unchanged and little modi- 
fied, with the exception of those amendments 
made by the Emperor Leon, the philosopher, 
these laws and these conditions governed the 
Eastern Empire from_now on until its fall before 
the arms of the Turks.)

the barbaric hordes that were then en- 
filading the Roman civilization. For the first 
time in the history of man the religious law was 
the same as the civil law, and for the first time in 
the history of man both represented human law. 
With Diocletian’s division of the Empire into 
four almost equal parts under two Augusti and 
two Cesars, there was frank acknowledgment that 
the great Roman Empire was at an end. With 
him, too, ended the fiction of a popular sovereignty. 
The Roman Emperor became an Eastern despot. 
He was no longer a man of the people easily to 
be seen and showing his democracy in frequent 
unofficial parade. 
He was now a secluded person wearing the dress 
of the Orientals, surrounded by servile officials;

and the Orientalism of the government went 
further when Constantine, at the farthest limit 
of Europe, built a new city, Constantinople, 
named after himself. Nominally it was but to 
divide with Rome the honours of being the capital; 
in reality it was to dim the even now fading lustre 
of the Seven Hills. 
From the frontiers of China to the Baltic there 
came pressing down on the fast disintegrating 
Roman Empire armies of barbarians. Amid all 
the disorder, the calamities without number, 
when civilization, science, and the arts were all 
obscured, the Church gained strength, its tenets 
held sway, its humanities were accepted as the 
conquerors in their turn became the conquered. 
The Christian religion slowly gripped them all as 
out of the convulsions of government there was 
born the modern Europe. 
To the Romans and their adopted allies it was 
a world of terror—to the Christians it was a 
friendly world, for the barbarians were known to 
the Church long before they were known to the 
soldiers who tried to repulse them. 
It has been the fashion to decry the value of the 
check that the Church put on the barbarous tribes 
in the early part of the Christian era.? Up to the 
very door of the Church there was, it is true, 
slaughter—there it stopped. Had it not been for 
the Church upholding what it did of civilization 
and humanity, it is difficult to say what would

have been the outcome of the hordes of Ostro- 
goths, Visigoths, Gephids, Longobards, Vandals, 
Burgundians, Franks, and Saxons who, at one time 
or another, fell upon Rome. 
But from the third century these invaders in 
their very triumph came face to face with a moral 
force that checked them as no army could, softened 
their manners, and uniting their rude strength with 
the last remains of the glory of Rome, gave to the 
world the civilized nations that now practically 
control both hemispheres. 
Of the first missionary efforts little is known. 
Jesus himself had said, ‘“‘Go ye therefore and teach 
all nations. . . . Teach them to observe all things 
whatsoever I have commanded you,’’' and was 
indeed himself the first missionary of the new faith. 
Of his immediate followers only three undertook 
missionary work. 
After the death of Jesus, the Apostles scattered 
over the whole world. ‘‘Thomas,’’ says Eusebius, 
“received Parthia as his alloted region; Andrew 
received Scythia, and John, Asia. . . . Peter ap- 
pears to have preached through Pontus, Galatia, 
Bithynia, Cappadocia, and Asia... and Paul 
spread the Gospel from Jerusalem to Illyricum.’’? 
From another source we are told that Matthew 
went into Athiopia, but in the following century 
there is little light as to who were the missionaries; 
but that they were everywhere successful is shown

by the reports of the Roman governors to the 
emperors. Undisputed claims of Tertullian and 
Justin also show that the work of conversion, 
despite the proscriptions, was going on rapidly 
enough. Ulfilas, ‘‘the Apostle of the Goths,” 
translated the Bible into their language in 325; 
Eusebius, Bishop of Vercelli in 370, made his 
cathedral the centre of missionary work. Chry- 
sostom trained people in the Gothic language and 
in missionary work and sent them among the Goths 
according to Theodoretius. * 
It was harder work in the West but it was more 
lasting. From Berins, an islet off the roadstead 
of Toulon where, in 410 A.D., a Roman patrician, 
Honoratus, had founded a monastic home, there 
were sent bishops to Arles, Avignon, Lyons, Troyes, 
Metz, and Nice, and many other places in southern 
and western Gaul, all to become the centres of 
missionary work. ? 
The proselyting spirit among these Frankish 
bishops gave rise to a great movement in the 
north. The preaching of Patrick was followed by 
what has been described as a marvellous burst of 
enthusiasm; and Celtic enthusiasm was from now 
to be counted on. Columba, the founder of Iona, 
was the missionary for the Northern Picts and the 
Albanian Scots; Aidan for the Northumbrian

Virgilius for Carinthia; Fridolin in Suabia and 
Alsace; Magnoald founded a monastery in Fingen; 
Trudpert penetrated as far as the Black Forest, 
where he was killed. 
(Among these people there had been a variety 
of conditions before the coming of, first the Romans, 
and secondly the Christians. Before the arrival 
of St. Patrick and the conversion of the natives 
there is very little doubt that part of the pagan 
worship included human sacrifice. On a plain 
in what is now the county of Leitrim which was 
then called the Magh-Sleacth, or Field of Slaughter, 
these primeval rites took place.) 
“There on the night of Sambhin, the same dread- 
ful tribute which the Carthaginians are known to 
have paid to Saturn in sacrificing to him their 
first-born, was by the Irish offered up to their 
chief idol, Crom-Cruach.’’* 
Of the Gauls and the Germans we learn some- 
thing from Cesar and Tacitus, but both are vague 
enough when it comes to the subject of children. 
The two people, according to Strabo, were as much 
alike as brothers. 
“The two races have much in common,” said 
Martin, ‘‘in their social organization.”” In Gaul 
the power of the father was absolute—viri in 
uxores sicut in liberos vite necisque habent potesta-

tem, wrote Cesar, and Tacitus tells us in Germant- 
cus that the husband had assisted in the execution 
of his adulterous wife by her nearest relatives— 
a condition that would lead one to believe that 
there was high regard for the mother of the family, 
although it has been said that Tacitus in painting 
the Germans as virtuous as he did? was following 
much along the lines of Fenimore Cooper in paint- 
ing the Indians a holy pink—he wished to improve 
the morals of his own countrymen and sacrificed 
truth as a detaining cargo. 
The Germans of the fourth century represented 
about the period of culture that our American 
Indians did when the English first arrived in this 
country. Unlike the Indians, they had the power 
to learn, whereas the Indians seemed to be able to 
learn only the vices of civilization. Their imagi- 
nation stirred by the stories that came back to 
them of the glory of Rome, they were for pressing 
forward. With the growing population that made 
migration necessary, and with the inimical forces 
pushing them from the rear, the ‘“‘open road” 
beckoned them on to Rome. 
Before the close of the fourth century the Gospel 
had been carried to them, especially to those near 
the Roman border.

  278 History of the Child 
among the Frisians, we learn that the father had 
the right to kill and expose his children when he 
was unable to provide them with nourishment; 
but once the child had taken of milk or eaten 
honey it could not be killed. The Emperor Julian, 
who loved literature more than he loved religion 
and has been decorated with the title Apostate, 
speaks of a custom of some of the barbarians who 
lived on the banks of the Rhine, which consisted 
of abandoning the new-born children on the waves 
of the river, believing that adulterous children 
would drown and legitimate children would 
survive.) 
The Church was here able ‘‘to concord the es- 
sentials of two bodies of law by discarding the 
elements of formalism and egoism in the Roman 
law and the hard and barbaric qualities of the 
German law; and introduced as governing prin- 
ciples of social and communal life the grave moral 
principles which Christ had proclaimed. The 
New Testament was the great law, the legislative 
ideal for all the Romano-Germanic peoples.” * 
In the semi-barbarian laws that came out as 
the result of the blending of their own customs 
with the Roman law, the combined product being 
softened by the Christian teaching, there is evi- 
dent always the Germanic idea of the wergeld by 
which a man paid for a crime, from the smallest 
to the greatest. And instead of the patria potestas

  Provisions of Salic Law 279 
we find the mundium, this word (hand) being 
used to describe all classes of protection. 
Infanticide is not mentioned as frequently as 
is abortion. To the belief that the infant had a 
soul was traceable this phase of semi-barbarian 
legislation. ) 
The Franks were not spoken of in history until 
240 A.D. (Aurelianus) and Salian Franks whose 
laws Montesquieu declared were much quoted 
and seldom read were subdued by Julianus.* 
According to the Salic law? to “‘kill a child that 
did not as yet have a name, that is to say one under 
eight days of age, was to be subject to a fine or 
wergeld of 100 sous or 4000 deniers’’$ xxiii, 4.

(To kill a boy under ten, according to the early 
manuscripts, meant a fine of 24,000 deniers, while 
the later manuscripts raised the age to twelve, as 
there was greater wergeld for killing one who was 
then considered a man. Oghlou suggests that 
while it cost but 200 sous to kill an ordinary free 
man, the price of an infant under twelve was 600

because ‘‘the cowardice of killing a child that 
had not arrived at the twelfth year appealed to 
the barbarians.” Such an interpretation would 
be crediting the Salians with a most humanitarian 
and nineteenth-century point of view. As a 
matter of fact, the fine for the murder of a child 
is the same as for the killing of a sagbaron (Dicuntur 
quosi senatores). 
The words puer crintus have been shown by 
Kern‘ to refer not to the fact that the boy was one 
of twelve years who had been allowed to wear his 
hair long, but one who ‘“‘by right of birth is al- 
lowed to wear his hair long in contradistinction to 
slaves and serfs.’’? 
(. To cut the hair of a boy or girl by force—and 
apparently against their will—meant a fine of forty- 
five sous. To kill a free girl before the age of 
twelve cost 200 sous, after the age of twelve, here 
given as the age of puberty, meant 600 sous. To 
kill a woman who was enceinte meant a wergeld of 
700 sous; to strike a woman who was enceinte was 
200 sous; if the child died, 600 sous, if the woman 
also died, 900 sous, and if the woman was in verbo

       bert, and Lothair, is also interesting in that it put 
a penalty on murders in such a way as to show 
that even the unborn child was given a value. A 
wergeld of 700 sous was declared against one who 
killed a woman who was enceinte, and to kill an 
unborn child entailed a wergeld of 200 sous. 
The law of the Allemands, the people who have 
passed away but who have left the name by which 
the French designate the Germans, differed from 
the Salic law in an interesting way. 
(The tendency and underlying idea of the laws 
of the time is well shown in the law of the Angles 
which punished the murder of a noble girl non 
nubile with the same wergeld of 600 sous that it 
punished the murder of a noble woman who was 
no longer able to bear children. The murder of a 
woman who was capable of bearing children was 
punishable by a wergeld three times the size of 
this. But the fine for a young girl or non fecund 
woman of the plain people was only 160 sous. ) 
(The Burgundians in their law had no regulation 
on either infanticide or abortion. The Ripurian 
Francs declared strongly against both in a law 
that imposed a fine of 100 sous on ‘‘any one 
who killed a new-born child that had not been 
named.” ) 
( The code of the Visigoths which was arranged 
after the middle of the fifth century is the severest 
of all in its penalties as to abortion and those in 
any way responsible for it.> 
In the matter of exposed children the law went 
\
-P-A-G-E-354
  282 History of the Child 
into details. Parents could not sell children, it 
states, nor put them in pawn. 
(_ “Whoever nourished a child that had been ex- 
posed, gained the value of a slave, which had to be 
paid by the parents of the exposed child when it 
was reclaimed by its parents. If the parents did 
not present themselves but they should be found 
out, they were forced to pay and might be sent into 
exile. If they did not have the means to pay, the 
one who had exposed the child became a slave in 
his-place to the rescuer. / 
“Tf a slave expose a child unknown to the master 
and the master swear that he was ignorant of the 
act, the person who rescues and brings up the 
child can recover only one fourth of its value; 
but if the exposure has been with the master’s 
knowledge, the rescuer can recover the full value 
of-the child.” 
\. Those to whom a child had been given away to 
bring up received an agreed price during the first 
ten years of the child. After that the law declared 
that the service of the child was sufficient com- 
pensation for its nurture—an interesting side- 
light on the time when a child became amenable

ples, ascribed to Alfred, made it necessary for 
the person in charge of a foundling at the time of 
its death, to establish the fact that the death had 
occurred in a perfectly natural way, a sage pre- 
caution and one centuries ahead of the time. ) 
Theodoric, or Dietrich as Charles Kingsley 
called him to the chagrin of Max Miller and 
others, as King of the Ostrogoths made an inter- 
esting ruling on the subject of the freedom of 
children in the year 500. We learn of this through 
his secretary, Cassiodorus, for, like other kings, 
the Ostrogoth was wise enough to have the clever- 
est literary man of his day to write his letters and 
leave behind his own approved account of his 
rei! 
According to this law, when a father because 
of poverty was obliged to sell his child, the child 
did not therefore lose his liberty.* 
Showing how nimble was not only the literary 
talent but the spirit of Cassiodorus, it is interesting 
to read in another part of the writings of the same 
author a rescript sent in the name of King Atha- 
laric, the successor of Theodoric and his grandson, 
to Severus, the governor of Lucania. Asa picture

belong to their respective sexes and ages, whom not 
captivity but freedom sets a price upon. These 
are with good reason sold by their parents, since 
they themselves gain by their servitude. For 
one cannot doubt that they are benefited even as 
slaves (or servants?), by being transferred from 
the toil of the fields to the service of the cities. }

sound of the human voice, as if the fountain itself 
desired to listen to the sermon.

to confide infants to the Church when mothers felt 
that they were unable to raise their offspring. ) [ the Eastern Empire it was always a fight

  288 History of the Child 
The gain made by the Church by this step was 
immeasurable, for however much those opposed to 
Christianity might argue, the onward march was 
irresistible when religion rested itself on the mother 
instinct and, without accusation or attempted 
retribution, willingly assumed the ties that mater- 
nity was obliged to forego. 
(By the door of the churches it became the 
custom to have a marble receptacle in which 
mothers placed the children that they were forced 
to abandon. The newly born was received by 
the matricularii or by the priest, who, following the 
form prescribed, asked those who assisted at the 
adoption ceremonies if there was any known per- 
son who would consent to take charge of the 
infant. These formalities had to receive the sanc- 
tion of the bishop. Not infrequently the priest 
succeeded in finding among the parishioners of 
his church someone who would adopt the infant, 
but if he did not, the church always assumed the 
responsibility and took care of the orphan. In 
some places the children that had been abandoned 
by their mothers were, by the order of the bishop, 
shown at the door of the church for ten days fol- 
lowing their abandonment, and if any one recog- 
nized and was able to declare who the parents 
were, he made such a declaration to the ecclesias- 
tical authorities—a dangerous custom as many 
unfortunate though innocent people discovered,’ 
In the case where some person not ‘officially 
connected with the church assumed the respon-

sibility of bringing up the abandoned child, such 
a person (nutricarit) received with the charge, a 
document wherein the fact of adoption was set 
forth, the circumstances under which the child 
was found, and the right of the adoptive parent to 
hold the child henceforth as a slave. In this con- 
nection it must be remembered that the Code of 
Justinian, which had put an end to this custom in 
the East, had no force in the West. The result 
was that in the European States which succeeded 
to the Western Roman Empire it was an almost 
general custom that abandoned children grew up 
in slavery. Indeed, so general was this custom 
that even the Church placed the newly born as 
among its assets, the church of Seville in Spain 
enumerating the number of abandoned children 
taken in as among its revenues. ) 
( At the Council of Rouen, held in the seventh 
century, the priests of each diocese were enjoined 
to inform their congregations that women who 
were delivered in secret might leave their infants 
at the door of the church. The church thereby 
attended to the immediate care of the newly born, 
and while the fact that the children were brought 
up in slavery was bad, it was a great improvement 
over the conditions in Rome and Greece. At 
least, if brought up in slavery, they were brought 
up with no criminal purpose and as far as the 
ecclesiastical authorities were able to regulate 
their lives, they were not condemned to lives of 
immorality.) 
19
-P-A-G-E-364
  290 History of the Child 
So bad, however, were the conditions in the 
seventh century, and so miserable and poor were 
the people, that despite the example and the 
preachings of the Church, thousands of children 
were thrown on the highways or left in deserted 
places to perish of starvation. Among the Gauls, 
before the domination of the Franks, the heads of 
families that lacked food, or the means to obtain 
it, took to the market their children and sold them 
as they would the veriest chattels. This traffic 
was not only common but it took place publicly, 
and not only in ancient France but in Germany, 
in Flanders, in Italy, and in England. Northern 
Europe was colder, more swampy, and more de- 
solate then than, it is now and across the bleak 
and uncultivated country, country such as one 
finds nowhere in Europe today but on the pro- 
fessional and bleak battlefields of Bulgaria and 
Servia, the half-starved peasants tramped, each 
with his group of children to place on sale when 
the coasts of Italy or France were reached./ 
It was in this way that Saint Bathilde, after- 
ward the wife of King Clovis II., became the slave 
of the mayor of the palace, Archambault. Bought 
by the latter, she was working as a slave in his 
household when the King saw her and fell in love 
with her.? 
_ Moved by such great misery and such odious 
traffic, holy men went, purse in hand, to the places

  Children Sold to Barbarians 291 
where these infants were being sold and purchased 
the unfortunates, giving them later their liberty. 
In this manner, Saint Eunice was purchased by 
an Abbé du Berry and Saint Thean by Saint 
Eloi.) The poverty led to even worse crimes than the 
selling of their own children for when it was found 
by the shiftless and impoverished that they could 
sell their own children and the foundlings that 
they picked up, not infrequently they robbed 
more fortunate parents of children that were being 
well taken care of/ 
Similar distress and want had led to similar 
conditions in the fifth century. In 449 A.D., the 
times were so hard and the people were in such a 
famished condition in Italy and Gaul that parents 
sold their children to middlemen even though 
they knew the children were to be resold to the 
Vandals in Africa. Two years later Valentinian 
broke up this practice, declaring that the person 
who sold a free person for the purpose of having 
that person sold to the barbarians would be fined 
six ounces of gold. ) 
This traffic was carried to such an excess in the 
British Islands that it became the principal ob- 
ject of an apostolic mission of Gregory who became 
Pope in 590. 
“Our Divine Redeemer,’’ he wrote, ‘‘has deliv- 
ered us from all servitude and has given unto us 
our original liberty. Let us imitate his example

by freeing from slavery those men who are free 
by the laws of nature.” 
The attitude toward children in England under 
the Anglo-Saxon kings' is shown by the fact that 
a boy’s accountability, his capability of bearing 
arms and of the management of his property be- 
gan, according to the earlier laws, in his tenth, but 
according to the laws of Athelstan, in his twelfth 
year.” ‘‘The accountability of children was ex- 
tended even to the infant in the cradle, whereby, 
in the case of theft committed by the father, they, 
like those of mature age, were consigned to slavery, 
but this cruel practice was by a law of Cnut 
strictly forbidden. This premature majority of 
the Anglo-Saxon youth accounts for the early 
accession to the throne of some of the kings, as 
Edward the Martyr, who was crowned in his 
thirteenth year. Majority at the age of ten is 
not mentioned in any other Germanic laws, ex- 
cepting in favour of the young testator, or the 
son whose father could not or would not support 
him. The beginning of the thirteenth year as 
that of majority is strictly and universally Ger- 
manic.’’4

    Views of Datheus 293 
Monfalcon, ‘‘were indeed admirable—they breathed 
the purest, the finest morality and the most ardent 
love of humanity, but they were unable to prevail 
against the ignorance of the people and the bar- 
barity of their morals.” 
Coming to the first attempts at organized effort 
to save children by the Church we find that Article 
70 of the Council of Nicaea instructed the bishop 
to establish in each city a place to which travellers, 
the sick and the poor, might appeal for aid and 
shelter. The Xenodocheion, as it was called, is 
to this day the word for ‘‘hotel” in modern 
Greece, where the traveller in Europe will conclude 
there is little evidence of improvement since the 
ecclesiastical foundation. These places were also 
used as the asylums for children, a fact that led 
them to be called Brephotrophia.* 
In the West a similar movement sprang up, and 
in the life of Saint Gour, contemporary of Childe- 
bert, it is said that at Tréves there was something 
like a systematic endeavour to protect children. 
A great obscurity hangs around this foundation, 
and it is equally difficult to determine positively 
what is the exact character of the institution 
ascribed to Saint Marmbceuf, who died in Angers 
in 654. 
Of the efforts of Datheus, however, there are 
no doubts, though interesting is the fact that no 
biographical encyclopedia contains even his name. 
He was Archbishop of Milan, and the first insti-

204 History of the Child 
tution to take care of helpless children was founded 
by him in 787. 
( “An enervating and sensual life,” declared 
Datheus in founding the asylum, ‘“‘leads many 
astray. They commit adultery and do not dare 
show the fruits in public and therefore put them 
to death. By depriving the children of baptism 
they send them to hell. These horrors would not 
take place if there existed an asylum where the 
adulterer could hide her shame, but now they 
throw the infants in the sewers or the rivers and 
many are the murders committed on the new-born 
children as the result of this illicit intercourse. ) 
“Therefore, I, Datheus, for the welfare of my 
soul and the souls of my associates, do hereby 
establish in the house that I have bought next to 
the church, a hospital for foundling children. My 
wish is that as soon as a child is exposed at the 
door of a church that it will be received in the 
hospital and confided to the care of those who will 
be paid to look after them. ... . These infants 
will be taught a trade and my wish is that when 
they arrive at the age of eight years they will be 
free from the shackles of slavery and free to come 
or go wherever they will.” *) 
In 1380 asimilar institution was opened in Venice, 
and in Florence in 1421. There is no doubt that 
similar institutions were most frequent in the 
fifteenth century. Pontanus, a writer of that

age, speaks of having seen nine hundred children 
in the one at Naples, and openly expresses his ad- 
miration for the liberal education that they re- 
ceived and the care bestowed on them by their 
teachers." ) 
The most purely religious institute appears to 
have been, according to the able Gaillard, that 
of the Bourgognes? in imitation of the charity of 
St. Marthe in her house in Bethany. An order, 
that of the chanoines réguliers du Saint Esprit, was 
founded, or at least encouraged by Guy of Mont- 
pellier about the end of the twelfth century for 
the express purpose of caring for poor and aban- 
doned children. The same institution is also 
said to have had for its founder, Olivier de la 
Crau in oro. In any case it was not until 1188, 
eight years after the foundation of the order 
ascribed to Guy of Montpellier, that the hospital 
of Marseilles was established. ) 
(The historians of Languedoc’ do not justify 
the assumption that this same Guy was the son 
of the Count of Montpellier, and all that we know 
is that ‘‘Brother Guy” or “‘Master Guy,” as he 
was differently called,‘ apparently founded an 
asylum for sick men and abandoned children. )

substantial donation to the Hospital of Saint 
Esprit at Montpellier, and to Guy, its founder.? 
Public approval was followed by official approval, 
for the Senate of Marseilles, or the Honourable 
Council, as it was called, held its meetings in the 
hospital founded there by Guy in 1188 and began 
its deliberations always with a discussion about 
the condition of the poor.?_/ 
Following the efforts of Guy of Montpellier, 
at Montpellier and at Marseilles, the movement, 
under the auspices of the hospitaliers of Saint 
Esprit, spread so rapidly that before the end of the 
century there were institutions at Rome,* one at 
Bergliac, and one at Troyes, and others in different 
places.‘ The order founded by Guy was given the 
approval of the Holy See, and its founder was 
called to Rome by Innocent III. and placed in 
charge of the house of Santa Maria in Sassia, 
where the Pope wished the same spirit that had 
marked Guy’s own institution at Montpellier. 
Guy died in Rome, 1208. 
The house of Santa Maria in Sassia to which 
Guy was called was attached to the church of that 
name which had been founded by Gna, king of the 
later Saxons, in 715. It had undergone many 
disastrous changes, but in 1198 Innocent III., at

his own expense, had it renovated and repaired 
for the sick and poor of Rome. In 1204, moved 
by the frequency with which the fishermen of the 
Tiber found in their nets the bodies of children 
that had been thrown into the river, the Pope 
dedicated part of the hospital to the care of aban- 
doned children, and it was to this institution that 
Guy of Montpellier was called. 
The humane movement spread rapidly, gener- 
ally under at least the nominal guidance of the 
Order of Saint Esprit. Many institutions, how- 
ever, were founded in the name of Saint Esprit 
where little attention was paid to children. 
The institution at Embeck? founded in 1274 
made a special work of taking care of abandoned 
children in the name of Saint Esprit. We come 
now to the name of Enrad Fleinz,? that bourgeois 
of Nuremberg, who in 1331 founded in his natal 
town the first hospital where not only children 
might be left, but where women might go to be 
delivered, without regard to whether the offspring 
were legitimate or not. This, too, was in the name 
of Saint Esprit, and in the year 1362, a similar 
asylum for orphans was founded in Paris. 
It was indeed under the auspices of this order 
that the movement which began with the imperial 
Brephotrophia in the sixth century grew, until 
the various institutions of one sort or another 
intended to prevent the outright murder of child-

ren or their abandonment in deserted places were 
dependent, not on the humanity of any one man 
or group of men, but on the new-born spirit that 
was then spreading throughout Europe and that 
continued to spread even when individualism and 
materialism as ruling forces had supplanted re- 
ligion and asceticism. The history of charity, 
which, as Lecky says, is yet to be written, will 
doubtless reveal, when it comes to be written, the 
various unappreciated factors that went to produce 
the humane movement. — 
Some idea of how rapidly these institutions had 
multiplied may be obtained from a bull of Nicho- 
las IV., containing a long enumeration of the vari- 
ous foundations, which includes places in Italy, 
Sicily, Germany, England, France, and Spain.* 
( Besides those enumerated by the Pope, there 
were however other institutions springing up 
where, either as an adjunct to hospital work or as 
an independent work itself, children were being 
cared for. As one of the original and most schol- 
arly writers on this phase of the subject has pointed 
out, it is difficult to make positive statements 
about these foundations, for the men interested 
were intent on their work rather than on leaving 
a record of it behind. Perhaps in this connection, 
some future historian, in viewing the voluminous 
charitable records of our day, will assume that 
“‘social”’ egotism has been well saddled, and made

to do more than the work of a timely charitable 
impulse. 
The conditions that led to the crusade of 
incent of Paul antedated that philanthropist 
by several hundred years. Where the religious 
spirit had failed to arouse interest in the problem 
of the welfare of parentless children, the large 
cities of Europe were themselves forced to take 
some action. Milan, in 1168, on the prayer of the 
Cardinal Galdinus, founded a hospital (which 
would indicate that the institution founded by 
Datheus had either fallen into disuse or was in- 
adequate) and Venice in 1380 followed the example 
of Milan, while the magnificent hospital for found- 
ling children in Florence (Spidale degl’ Innocenti) 
was founded, after a long deliberation in open 
council, on October 25, 1421, 
( Included in these governmental or municipal 
movements is that of St. Thomas of Villeneuve, 
Archbishop of Valence, who created an asylum in 
his own palace at the beginning of the fifteenth 
century, and gave orders that no children pre- 
sented there should be turned away. 
( The Hotel-Dieu de Notre Damé de Pitié of 
Lyons, which by letters patent of 1720 was de- 
clared to be the oldest hospital of France, com- 
menced in 1523 the same work, and in that year 
is recorded as having received nine children. On 
February 25, 1530, Frangois the First recognized 
the right of the institution to take in these 
children. ) 
   
-P-A-G-E-378
  300 History of the Child 
In 1596 the city of Amsterdam began to make 
proyision for the abandoned children.) 
_The beginning of the movement in Paris, we 
learn, was the result of the terrible conditions 
that followed the war in 1360, 1361, and 1362.7 
Poverty and misery were everywhere, and a large 
number of orphans practically lived and died in 
the streets, says Breuil in his Antigquités de Paris. 
Various charitable people took in some of these 
unfortunates, the Hotel-Dieu being overrun; but, 
as the conditions were but little ameliorated, on 
February 7, 1362, a group of citizens went to the 
“Reverend father in God, Messire Jean de Meu- 
lant, 88th Bishop of Paris,” and discussed with 
him the frightful conditions of the poor boys and 
girls of Paris. The evils attending the homeless 
condition of the latter were especially considered. 
We are told that the result of the conference was 
that the Bishop gave them permission to institute 
and erect a hospital of Saint Esprit and bestowed 
on-each one of the conferees forty days’ indulgence.) 
\ The institution that arose as a result of this 
conference has been criticized as being narrow in 
its purpose, inasmuch as the rules declared that 
only legitimate children, born of parents in Paris, 
were to be admitted; but the restriction, it must 
be understood, was necessary, in view of the small 
funds in hand. 
(But humanitarian feeling was growing; and

in which the orphan children of Paris were brought 
up, referring to the Hospital of Saint Esprit and 
the House of the Enfants-Dieu. After long

WORK AND HIS SUCCESS. 
history of the child in Europe moves as 
from one mountain peak to another with 
a long valley of gloom in between. Datheus has 
received no credit; Vincent de Paul has been justly 
recognized as a deserving contemporary of that 
list of brilliant men who went to make up the 
Golden Age of France. Golden Age that it was, 
with its highly polished manners, there, under the 
reign of the elegant Mazarin and the delicate Anne 
of Austria, it was no uncommon sight to see a 
child lying dead on the pavements, while others 
died of misery and hunger under the very eyes of 
the passers-by. Not a day passed, say the chron- 
iclers, when the men who had charge of the sewers 
or the police did not draw out at least the body 
of one child. 
At the beginning of the seventeenth century 
Europe, and France especially, was war-ridden.

  Responsibility of Sedgueurs 303 
During the sixteenth century, the religious and 
charitable impulses had suffered, first through the 
national war, then by the factional wars, and 
finally by religious wars. 
“The religious war,” said the historian of Lan- 
guedoc,* ‘‘almost entirely destroyed the Hospital 
of Montpellier . . . and even the order of Saint 
Esprit was dying out throughout France.” 
It was a curious and disjointed society, that of 
the France of that day. Kingdoms there were 
within the royal domain; the laws of the large city 
frequently clashing with those of the province 
within which it was located; here and there pro- 
vinces following their own laws rather than the 
laws of the kingdom itself. In some provinces 
the Church dominated; in others the nobles; else- 
where, the two classes were beginning to melt into 
the body of the nation which occasionally overrode 
both.? ) i 
(At Aix, for instance, it was the custom to place 
the abandoned child in a religious home where, 
as in the rest of Provence, the unknown bastard 
was charged to the nearest hospital. Practically 
the same law was observed in Bretagne. / 
At Poitiers, a decree on September 15, 1579, 
“condemning the provision by which religious 
orders nourished infants found at their door,” 
ordered that the monasteries and ecclesiastic chap- 
ters of the place should be called on to regu-

late their contributions to the support of the 
children. 
But as a rule the great nobles were obliged to 
take care of the foundlings abandoned within their 
jurisdiction. In the origin of the fiefs, the bas- 
tards had been set down as épaves (waifs), and the 
interpreters of the law (jurisconsults) had decided 
that the lord had no right to refuse to take care 
of the épaves. The parliaments too took the view 
that, inasmuch as the seigneur profited by all 
deaths that occurred and succeeded to all titles 
in the case of disinheritance within his domain, 
he should accept the liability for the care of the 
unknown children found within their domain.) 
Of the many decrees which touch on this im- 
portant point, the oldest is that of the Parliament 
of Paris in the year 1547. Many other arréts 
followed, until on September 3, 1667, the following, 
in the interest of the special hospitals, declared 
that: 
“All the seigneurs (hauts jusiiciers) will be held 
responsible for the expense and nourishment of 
all infants whose parents are unknown, and who 
are found exposed on their lands and taken to 
hospitals.” \ 
This regulation, as Ramcle says, failed in its 
purpose, for it was not possible to force what was 
considered charity on the none too generous nobles. 
The laws were evaded, and each community tried 
to send to its neighbours the unfortunate infants 
it should have guarded.
-P-A-G-E-383
  Work of Vincent de Paul 305 
(The mortality of infants increased, and as in 
Rome in the days of the Empire, mothers threw 
their children into the sewers or left them on the 
highways. Those less inhuman left them at the 
doors of the hospitals, where, during the winter, 
in the morning, they were frequently taken in 
more dead than alive. 
les course, the laws against these abandonments 
re promptly enforced—the unfortunate women 
were easily punished. A girl who killed her off- 
spring was hung, and others who were caught leav- 
ing children in solitary places were whipped and 
disgraced in the cities and villages where they lived.) 
By an edict of Henry II., under penalty of 
punishment, a woman enceinte was obliged to de- 
clare her condition; and to add to this bungling 
legislative effort, she was obliged to tell who the 
guilty man was, the maxim creditur virgini being 
accepted everywhere. The attempts at curing the 
ills failed, for, while the intentions of the legis- 
lators were undoubtedly honest, they only exposed 
shameless conditions, made the unfortunate suffer 
even more, brought ruin to many honest families, 
and gain to shameless women only. The number 
of children abandoned and murdered in defiance 
of the regulations increased instead of decreasing. ) 
(At this time there came an individual effort to 
better things, by a woman whose name is not even 
known and whose efforts at a noble work have, 
owing to the actions of her servants, been much 
misinterpreted. )

  306 History of the Child 
Living in a house in the Cité de Saint-Landry, 
Paris, with two servants, she received every morn- 
ing the infants that the soldiers (or police) had 
collected during the night. So many were even- 
tually turned over to her, that she was unable to 
feed them, and many died in her own house for 
lack of food. In the crowded conditions we are 
also told a selection? was made and some of the 
children were exposed again, or at least they were 
turned over to some charitable or interested per- 
son who would accept them. The care of the 
children devolving finally on the two servants, 
many of them are said to have perished from 
the drugs they were given to keep them quiet. 
The availability of children as beggars led the 
servants to look on them as a means of money 
making, and they were sold for various cruel and 
evil purposes, a condition that eventually led to 
the reform undertaken by Vincent de Paul) 
. The fact that they frequently fell into the hands 
of magicians, mountebanks, and pedlars, who 
deformed them in order to make them of assistance 
in earning a livelihood, is attested by the biog- 
rapher of Vincent. 
\ “Returning from one of his missions,” says 
Maury, ‘‘Vincent de Paul, whom I have dared to 
call almost the visible angel of God, found under 
the walls of Paris one of these infants, in the hands 
of a beggar, who was engaged in deforming the

limbs of the child. Although almost overcome 
with horror, he ran to the savage with that in- 
trepidity with which the virtuous man always at- 
tacks crime. ) 
‘Barbarian,’ he cried, ‘how you deceive me— 
from a distance I took you for a man!’ 
“He snatched the victim from its persecutor, 
carried it in his arms across Paris, gathered a 
crowd about him and called on them to witness 
the brutality of the day and place in which they 
lived. A few days later he had founded his first 
institution for children, and the cause of children 
had enrolled one of its noblest champions.” 
In order to thoroughly understand the situation, 
a number of charitable women under the guidance 
of Madame Legas, niece of the Lord Chancellor 
Marillac,* went to the house in the Cité de Saint- 
Landry and studied the question from the inside 
of the house. Their horror at the things they 
saw led them to declare that the children mas- 
sacred by Herod were fortunate in comparison 
with the condition of the orphans of Paris.? As 
it was impossible to take charge of all the children 
then in the Cité de Saint-Landry twelve children 
were taken, and in 1638, under the care of Madame 
Legas and some charitable women, a house was 
opened for them in the Faubourg Saint-Victor. 
As they were able to enlarge the scope of their

institution, more and more children were taken 
care of; the enthusiasm of these women ran so 
high under the glowing example of Vincent, 
that even in the dead of night in the cold corners, 
they would be found going about the streets of 
Paris, into the worst and least lighted sections, 
doing police duty, gathering the unfortunate 
victims, and carrying them to the house in the 
Faubourg Saint-Victor.*) 
In the course of time, sufficient interest had 
developed in this work so that enough money was 
forthcoming to enlarge the scope. Vincent gath- 
ered together the pious women who had acted as 
his assistants and addressed to them that tou- 
chante allocution, sometimes quoted as a model of 
eloquence. The house in the Faubourg Saint- 
Victor was soon found to be too small, and 
the Chateau de Bicétre was obtained from the 
king. 
The place was not found suitable on account of 
the vivacité de l’air and the children were trans- 
ferred to the Faubourg Saint-Lazare, then in 
1672 to the Cité, near Notre Dame, where they 
remained up to the Revolution. Then they were 
assigned the ancient abbaye of Port Royal and the 
maison de l’Oratoire, located in the southern part 
of Paris. 
The success of the new undertaking was so 
great that even Louis XIII. became interested and

    Edict of Louis XIV. 309 
donated four thousand francs per year to the char- 
ity. Inasmuch as in the long history of the child’s 
fight for a place in the government, this was the 
first recognition by a government since the Roman 
emperors, it is interesting to read Louis’s own 
statement in the preamble of the letters patent 
relating to this gift: 
C‘Having been informed by persons of great 
piety, that the little attention which has been 
given up to the present to the nourishing and care 
of the parentless children exposed in the city and 
outskirts of Paris has been the cause of death, 
and even has it been known that they have been 
sold for evil purposes, and this having brought 
many ladies to take care of these children, who 
have worked with so much zeal and charitable 
affection that their zeal is spreading, and wishing 
so much to do what is possible_under the pres- 
ent circumstances, * we have,” etc.) 
The example of Louis was followed in 1641 by 
his widow, Anne of Austria, who made an annual 
gift of 8000 francs. She had become regent and, 
speaking in the name of the young King, said that 
“Gmitating the piety and the charity of thelate 
King, which are truly royal virtues, he adds to this 
first gift, another annual gift of 8000 francs. 
Thanks to what has already been given and the 
charity of individuals, the greater number of the

Bas and in Cologne, and the conspiracy of Cinq-Mars had just 
been discovered.

infants rescued have been raised, and there are 
now more than four hundred living.” 
In June, 1670, Louis XIV. made the children’s 
hospital one of the institutions of Paris, and 
authorized it to discharge the functions and enjoy 
the-privileges of such an institution. 
(‘As there is no duty more natural,” he declared, 
“and none that conforms more to the idea of 
Christian charity than to care for the unfortunate 
children who are exposed—their feebleness and 
their misfortune making them doubly worthy of 
our compassion ... considering also that their 
protection and safeguarding is to our advantage 
inasmuch as some of them may become soldiers, 
others workmen, inhabitants of the colonies,”’ etc. * 
The edict declared that while the expenses of 
the institution had reached forty thousand francs 
a year, the royal donation could not exceed twelve 
thousand francs, and the King exhorted the 
women of charity who had done so much, to con- 
tinue their notable work.) 
This royal recognition of the great institution 
at Paris was not without evil effect in the pro- 
vinces. The nobles and the civic authorities of 
rural communities, wishing to get rid of the burden 
of the infants deserted within their jurisdiction, 
had the unfortunates taken to Paris.27, They were 
usually carried there by men who were driving 
in on other business, and as many stops were

made between the starting point and the destina- 
tion, and as the drivers were more interested in 
other things than in the infant baggage, for which 
they were paid in advance, the mortality greatly 
increased, 
(“There was hardly a town in the kingdom,” 
said Latyone,' “‘where abandoned children were 
admitted freely and without information being 
requested. In the towns that were not too far 
from Paris, they were carried thirty and forty 
leagues, at the risk of having them die on the 
way; and the hospital at Paris was overcrowded 
and in debt.’’) 
© This condition of affairs led to a new law, after 
a report which declared that of two thousand in- 
fants carried to Paris from the provinces, in all 
sorts of weather, by public vehicles without care or 
protection, three quarters had died within three 
months. The new law decreed that any wagoner 
bringing an infant to Paris to expose it would be 
fined one thousand livres. Inasmuch as the rule 
was made in the interest of the children, it was 
also decreed that abandoned children must be 
brought to the nearest hospital, and if that hospi- 
tal declared that it had not enough funds to sup- 
port the foundlings, the royal treasury might be 
drawn on,)

CHAPTER XXII 
RISE OF FACTORY SYSTEM—THE CHILD A CHARGE ON 
THE STATE—CHILDREN ACTUALLY SLAVES UNDER 
FACTORY SYSTEM—REFORM OF 1833—OASTLER 
AGAINST THE CHILD SLAVERY—“‘ JUVENILE LABOUR 
IN FACTORIES IS A NATIONAL BLESSING”’ 
HE cannibalistic stage has passed and the 
TI day of sacrifice has passed—no longer is 
the child frankly a convenience nor is its 
life, as a result of past economic stress, a lightly 
considered trifle to be tossed into the cauldron of 
religious ceremony. Philosophy, humanity, civi- 
lization, and religion have combined to make the 
life of the child safe. 
With what result? 
The general belief that children were not regu- 
larly employed until the middle of the last cen- 
tury, when the factory system arose, had led to the 
equally erroneous belief that it was in the factory 
where the industrial abuse of children was first 
practised. In France where there was little in- 
dustrial use for children in the large centres of 
population, where in other words children did not 
pay, the problem of modern humanity was to 
save infants from exposure and death. In Eng- 
312 
 
-P-A-G-E-391
  Industrial Abuses 313 
land where there was an industrial use for them 
from early times, and where from the earliest 
times there are records of their abuse, there was 
no necessity for measures to protect them from 
infanticidal tendencies. But it is in England 
that we must study the ill-treatment of children 
that was brought about by the desire to make 
them useful. 
The industrial records of the Middle Ages con- 
tain but few references to children, for the adults 
were busy with their own troubles. One of the 
first of these notices was an order issued by the 
famous Richard Whittington, in 1398, and, al- 
though it is mixed with other considerations, it 
shows the human spark. It reads: 
“ORDINANCES OF THE HuRERs.

“On the 20th day of August, in the 22d year,

“In the first place——that no one of the said

taining to scouryng, belonging to the said trade, 
in any open place: but they must do this in their 
own houses; seeing that some persons in the said

trade have of late sent their apprentices and 
journeymen as well as children of tender age and 
others, down to the water of Thames and other 
exposed places, and amid horrible tempests, 
frosts, and snows, to the very great scandal, as 
well of the good folks of the said trade, as of the. 
City aforesaid. And also, because of that divers 
persons, and pages belonging to lords, when they 
take their horses down to the Thames, are often- 
times wrangling with their said apprentices and 
journeymen; and they are then on the point of 
killing one another, to the very great peril that 
seems likely to ensue therefrom.’’! 
In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, when 
the peasants were the villeins of the owners of the 
land and held their small farms in return for the 
work done, the work of children was contracted 
for, ‘‘the lord very frequently demanding the 
labour of the whole family, with the exception of 
the housewife.”’?, 
Nearly all the trades and manufactures in the 
Middle Ages were under the control of the guilds, 
so that almost all of the children working, except- 
ing those on farms or in domestic service, came 
under their supervision. The attitude of the 
guilds toward child labour is shown in the regula- 
tions of the apprenticeships, but this interest was 
mainly industrial, for in regulating the work of

    the children they protected their members from 
cheap labour and at the same time, by their super- 
vision over the work of the rising generation, saw 
that the guild’s reputation for the proper kind of 
labour was kept.up and prices therefore held to a 
desirable level.* ) 
¢ ‘At the same time there was a religious side to the 
guilds, a strong religious side, and while everything 
they did, such as the prohibition of night work 
(not out of consideration of the health of the workers 
but because it might lead to bad work),? had a 
purely industrial aspect, there is no doubt that 
this social and religious side developed in the guilds 
and their members an outlook on the broader 
and more humane aspects of their own place in 
society. The custom of not permitting a man to 
employ other than his own wedded wife and his 
own daughter was not humanitarian in its inten- 
tion but its effect could not be other than beneficial 
(‘No one of the said trade,” said the ordinances 
of the Braelers (makers of braces) in 1355, ‘‘shall 
be so daring as to work at his trade at night . . . © 
also, that no one of the said trade shall be so 
daring as to set any woman to work in his trade, 
other than his wedded wife, or his daughter.” s 
In 1562 the Statute of Artificers was passed, 
regulating the system of apprenticeship which had

hitherto been a matter of regulation only among 
the guilds themselves. The national sanction 
thereby given to the apprentice system meant 
much and had a great influence in the years to 
come. The chief features of the Act, binding by 
indenture, registration of the agreement, and a 
minimum term of seven years on the indoor system, 
led to the master’s entire control of the boy and 
up to 1814 affected the relationships of the child 
employed or otherwise under the control of an 
employer. 
Coincident with the development of the interest 
in the child as an industrial factor arose the inter- 
est in the child as a charge on the State, a phase 
of the child question that in the ancient civiliza- 
tions had found its answer mainly in the toleration 
of infanticide. The Common Council of London 
on September 27, 1556, passed an Act, the follow- 
ing extract from which will go to show that there 
was then an attempt to go back of the child 
problem and an endeavour to regulate marriage.

(In the time of Henry VIII. an attempt was 
made to take care of the question of the growing 
number of vagrant children by making all vagrant 
children between the years of five and fourteen 
liable to be bound out to some master as appren- 
tices, the boys until they were twenty-four and 
the-girls until they were twenty.’ 
(in 1601 a statute was passed which gave to 
justices of the peace the power of apprenticing 
not only the children of paupers and vagrants 
but the children of those parents who were over- 
burdened with children and who were unable to 
support them.

In the seventeenth century, the practice of 
putting children prematurely to work prevailed 
to an extent which, when compared with the ex- 
tent of the manufacturing system, ‘‘seems almost 
incredible,” says Macaulay.? 
A little creature of six years old was thought fit 
for labour in the town of Norwich, the chief seat 
of the clothing trade. Writers at that time, and 
among them some who were considered as emi- 
nently benevolent, * mention, ‘‘with exultation, the 
fact that in that single city boys and girls of tender 
age created wealth exceeding what was necessary 
for their own subsistence by twelve thousand 
pounds a year.”

Getting Rid of Idiots 319 
c made within twenty years, steam was applied to 
~ the new looms, and the modern factory system 
had fairly begun. With the demand for labour- 
ers and the fact that the division of labour brought 
about a call for low-priced workmen, some of the 
divisions really necessitating no greater intelli- 
gence than that of a child, the children were in 
great demand.’ 
‘Tt was here that the Statute of Artificers as- 
Sisted in the crushing industrial conditions, for 
the overseers of the poor became the agents of 
the mill-owners and arranged for days when the 
pauper children could be inspected and selected 
for the factory work. When the selections had 
been made, the children were conveyed by canal 
boats and wagons to the destination, and then 
their slavery began. Sometimes men who made 
a business of trafficking in children would transfer 
them to a factory district where they were kept 
in a dark cellar until the mill-owner, in want of 
hands, came to look them over and pick out those 
that he thought would be useful. Nominally 
the children were apprentices, but actually they 
were slaves and their treatment was most inhuman. 
The parish authorities, in order to get rid of the 
imbeciles, often bargained that the mill-owners 
take one idiot with every twenty children. What 
became of the idiots after they had passed into 
the hands of the capitalist is not known, but in

most cases they did not last long and mysteriously 
disappeared. / 
No matter what the conditions and no matter 
how ill the children, they were worked without 
any visible vestige of human feeling. Even as 
late as 1840 in the evidence given before the Select 
Committee investigating the conditions of facto- 
ries after the passage of the Reform Act of 1833, 
these were the conditions that the inspectors 
reported: 
Q. “Have you many lace-mills in your dis- 
trict?” 
A. “T have about thirty mills.” 
Q. ‘‘What are the usual hours of work in these 
mills?” 
A. ‘‘The usual hours are, about Nottingham, 
twenty hours a day, being from four o’clock in the 
morning till twelve o’clock at night; about Chester- 
field, the report I have had from the superintendent 
is, that they work twenty-four hours, all through 
the night, in several mills there.” 
Q. ‘‘Are there many children and young per- 
sons in those mills?” 
A. ‘The proportion is less in lace-mills than 
in others, but it is necessary to have some of 
them; the process of winding and preparing the 
bobbins and carriages requires children; those 
that I saw so employed were from ien to fifteen 
years of age.” 
Q. ‘Are the children detained in the mills 
during a considerable period of the day and night?” 
 
-P-A-G-E-401
    Select Committee of 1840 321 
A. “TI can speak from information derived 
from two or three mill-owners, and also more 
extensively from reports by one of the superinten- 
dents in my district; and I should say that in 
most of the mills they do detain them at night; 
in some of them, the report states that they are 
detained all night, in order to be ready when 
wanted.” 
Q. “Are the children that are so detained 
liable to be detained throughout the day, and do 
they sometimes begin their work at twelve o’clock 
at night?” 
A. “In the mills at Nottingham there are 
owners that make it a rule that they will not keep 
the children after eight, or nine, or ten o’clock, 
according to the inclination of the mill-occupier.” 
Q. ‘Where are those children during the time 
they are detained in the mill?” 
A. When detained at night, and not employed 
I am told they are lying about on the floor.” 
Q. ‘‘Is it customary to close at eight on Satur- 
day evening in the lace-mills?”’ 
A. “TI think it is.” 
Q. ‘How then do they compensate for the 
loss of those four hours’ work in those mills?” 
A. “By working all night on Friday ; those 
are the mills in which they pay so much for their 
power.” 
Q. ‘‘Must not there be a considerable wear and 
tear upon the physical constitution of children 
who are kept in this state?” 
2r   
 
-P-A-G-E-402
  322 History of the Child 
A. “TI think it is self-evident.” 
Q. ‘‘Is there any possibility of their obtaining 
education under those circumstances?” 
A. “None whatever, except on Sundays.” 
Q. ‘‘But, after one hundred and twenty hours’ 
work in the week, is it possible that they can 
have much capacity for study on Sunday?’ 
A. “It is not always that the same children 
are kept twenty hours, because some mills have 
two complete sets of hands for their machinery, 
and they work the same set of hands only ten 
hours.” | 
Q. ‘But, even under those circumstances, it 
must frequently happen that the same children 
are employed during the night twice or thrice in 
the course of a week?” 
A. ‘The practice generally is that they take 
the night-work for one week, and then the next 
week the morning-work.”’ 
Q. ‘‘So that during one whole week they are 
employed in the night-work?”’ 
isi TX eS. 
Q. “At the end of a week, during which they 
have been employed in the night, do you think 
that they have much capacity left for study on 
Sunday?” 
A. ‘“‘No; my opinion is most decidedly that 
either turning out at four o’clock in the morning, 
or being kept out of bed at night, must be inju- 
rious to children, both to their physical constitu- 
tion and their mental powers.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-403
  “Twenty Hours a Day” 323 
Q. ‘The law, as it stands, does not prevent 
the children from being employed even twenty 
hours?” 
A. “It does not apply to lace-mills.” 
Q. ‘Therefore the period during which the 
child is employed depends upon the varying 
humanity of the individual proprietor of the mill?” 
AS, eS uYes.”” 
Q. ‘You say that it sometimes happens that 
the children come to the mill at five in the morn- 
ing, and do not leave it till ten at night?” 
A. “‘Itis reported to me that it does so happen 
about Chesterfield.” 
Q. “If a child is kept in winter till twelve 
o'clock at night, and has then to go home and 
return to the factory in the morning, a distance 
of two miles, does not he undergo fearful hard- 
ships?” 
A. ‘‘Certainly.”* 
(The children who were apprenticed out to the 
mill-owners were fed on the coarsest kind of food 
and in the most disgusting way. They slept by 
turns, in relays, in beds that were never aired, 
for one set of children were turned into the beds 
as soon as another set had been driven out to their 
long and filthy toil. Some tried to run away and 
after that they were worked with chains around 
their ankles; many died and the little graves were 
unmarked in a desolate spot lest the number of 
the dead attract too much attention, /

-P-A-G-E-404
  324 History of the Child 
Sixteen hours a day, six days a week, was no 
uncommon time for children, and on Sunday they 
worked to clean the machine. 
“Tn stench, in heated rooms, amid the constant 
whirling of a thousand wheels, little fingers and 
little feet were kept in ceaseless action, forced 
into unnatural activity by blows from the heavy 
hands and feet of the merciless overlooker, and 
the infliction of bodily pain by instruments of 
punishment, invented by the sharpened ingenuity 
of insatiable selfishness.”’* ) 
The agitation against these conditions led, in 
1802, to an Act being passed by the influence of 
Sir Robert Peel for the preservation of the health 
and morals of apprentices and others employed 
in cotton and other mills./ 
The immediate cause of this was the fearful 
spread through the factories in the Manchester 
district of epidemic diseases due to overwork, 
scanty food, wretched clothing, long hours, bad 
ventilation, among the working people and espe- 
cially among the children.) 
As far as reforming the conditions in which the 
children lived, the Act, however, was a dead letter, 
and in a debate introduced by Sir Robert Peel 
on June 6, 1815, one speaker, Horner, told of the 
sale of a gang of children with the effects of a 
bankrupt. } 
“A still more atrocious instance,’ continued 
the speaker, ‘“‘had been brought before the Court

      Richard Oastler’s Crusade 325 
of King’s Bench two years ago, when a number of 
these boys apprenticed by a parish in London to 
one manufacturer had been transferred (7. e., 
sold) to another and had been found by some 
benevolent persons in a state of absolute famine.’’* 
No longer could people ignore conditions such 
as these and a Select Committee of the House of 
Commons was empowered to take evidence on 
the state of children working in the manufactories 
of Great Britain. Despite the horrible nature of 
the evidence, when the Act resulting from the 
investigation was passed, all that it did was to 
make nine years the limit to age employment and 
twelve hours a day the working day for those 
under sixteen years. But it was limited in effect 
to cotton factories only, leaving the woollen and 
worsted factories absolutely untouched, and even 
in the matter of the cotton factories these provi- 
sions were frequently avoided. 
Conditions continued to become worse instead 
of better, children of both sexes being beaten and 
overworked to make profit for the rich capitalists 
until 1830, when Richard Oastler, who had led 
in the fight against black slavery, had his atten- 
tion called to the conditions under which the 
children of England were practically enslaved. ? 
Oastler was talking one night about his slavery 
reforms to a friend near Bradford and the remark 
was made to him: “I wonder you never turned

your attention to the factory.” ‘‘Why should I?” 
replied the young abolitionist, ‘‘I have nothing 
to do with factories.” ‘‘Perhaps not,’’ was the 
answer, ‘‘but you are very enthusiastic against 
slavery in the West Indies and I assure you that 
there are cruelties practised in our mills on little 
children which I am sure if you knew you would 
try to prevent.” 
The man who gave this suggestion, John Wood, 
was himself an owner of a mill and he admitted 
to Oastler that in his own mill the little children 
were worked from six in the morning until seven 
at night with a break of only forty minutes for 
lunch and that various devices, including beatings 
with sticks and straps and clubs, were employed 
to-goad them on to renewed labour. 
The very next day Oastler began a crusade 
which lasted for many weary years. He succeeded 
in interesting J. Hobhouse and M. T. Sadler, 
both members of the House of Commons, and the 
ten hours agitation began in and out of Parlia- 
ment. In the course of a speech delivered in 
March, 1832, in favour of the ten hours bill, Sadler 
declared that so great was the demand in some 
districts for children’s labour that ‘‘an indispens- 
able condition of marriage among the working 
classes was the certainty of offspring whose wages, 
beginning at six years old, might keep their in- 
human fathers and mothers in idleness.’”) 
( “Our ancestors could not have supposed it 
possible,’ exclaimed Sadler, ‘‘posterity will not 
 
-P-A-G-E-407
      Sadler Committee’s Report 327 
“ believe it true—that a generation of Englishmen 
could exist, or had existed, that would work lisp- 
ing infancy a few summers old, regardless alike 
of its smiles or tears, and unmoved by its unresist- 
ing weakness, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, sixteen 
hours a day, and through the weary night also, 
till in the dewy morn of existence, the bud of 
youth was faded and fell ere it was unfolded.’ 
But, to the nation’s eternal disgrace, that gen- 
eration of Englishmen did exist, and Mr. Sadler 
told the House, detail by detail, of the evils and 
outrages of the whole abominable system. Ex- 
cessive hours, low wages, immorality, ill-health— 
all were enumerated, and then he continued: 
“Then in order to keep them awake, to stimu- 
late their exertions, means are made use of to 
which I shall now advert, as a last instance of the 
degradation to which this system has reduced the 
manufacturing operatives of this country. Child- 
ren are beaten with thongs, prepared for the 
purpose. Yes, the females of this country, no 
matter whether children or grown up, and I hardly 
know which is the more disgusting outrage, are 
beaten, beaten in your free market of labour as 
you term it, like slaves. The poor wretch is 
flogged before its companions, flogged, I say, like 
a dog, by the tyrant overlooker. We speak with 
execration of the cartwhip of the West Indies, but 
let us see this night an equal feeling rise against 
the factory thong in England.”’*)

  328 History of the Chlld 
(interesting too was the fact brought out at this 
time that while these were the conditions in Eng- 
land, in the colonies black labour was protected 
to the extent that nine hours a day was the legal 
day for adults and young persons and children 
were not allowed to work more than six, while 
night work was simply prohibited. ) 
The investigation of the Sadler Committee 
evoked the interesting information from one wit- 
ness that children were never employed if they 
were under five. 
The attitude of the employers toward the agita- 
tion can be best judged from the following extracts: 
“Every man acquainted with the political 
history of the last century must know, that the 
labour of children was actually pointed out to the 
manufacturers by Mr. William Pitt, as a new re- 
source by which they might be enabled to bear the 
additional load of taxation which the necessities 
of the State compelled him to impose. The neces-. 
sity for labour created by this taxation has not 
yet abated; because the immense capital taken 
away by the enormous expenditure of the great 
wars arising out of the French Revolution, an 
expenditure which was mainly supported out of 
the industrial resources of the country, has not 
been replaced. But even independent of these 
considerations, and irrespective of a past which can 
never be recalled, we mean to assert, as we have 
done elsewhere, in broad terms and the plainest 
language, that the infant labour, as‘it is erroneously 
 
-P-A-G-E-409
    Shaftesbury’s Reform 329 
called—or the juvenile labour, as it should be 
called—in factories, is in fact a national blessing, 
and absolutely necessary for the support of the 
manifold fiscal burthens which have been placed 
upon the industry of this country. It is quite 
sufficient to say that the children of the operatives 
have mouths, and must be fed; they have limbs, 
and must be clothed; they have minds, which 
ought to be instructed; and they have passions, 
which must be controlled. Now, if the parents 
are unable to provide these requisites, and their 
inability to do so is just as notorious as their 
existence, it becomes absolutely necessary that 
the children should aid in obtaining them for 
themselves. To abolish juvenile labour, is’ plainly 
nothing else than to abolish juvenile means of sup- 
port; and to confine it within very narrow limits, 
is just to subtract a dinner or a supper from the 
unhappy objects of mistaken benevolence.” * 
( The result of all this agitation and debate was 
the famous Act of 1833 introduced by Lord 
Shaftesbury which prohibited night work to 
persons under eighteen in cotton, woollen, and 
other factories, and provided that children from 
nine to thirteen years of age were not to work 
more than forty-eight hours a week and those 
from thirteen to eighteen not to work more than 
sixty-eight hours. Children under nine were not 
to be employed at all

Even this much was not obtained until Oastler 
had succeeded in driving home to the British 
mind conditions such as:are described in a speech 
delivered at Huddersfield, December 26, 1831, of 
which the following is an extract: 
“T will not picture fiction to you,” said Oastler, 
in the early days of the factory movement, ‘‘but I 
will tell you what Ihaveseen. Takea little female 
captive, six or seven years old; she shall rise from 
her bed at four in the morning of a cold winter 
day, but before she rises she wakes perhaps half a 
dozen times, and says, ‘Father, isit time? Father, 
is it time?’ And at last, when she gets up and puts 
her little bits of rags upon her weary limbs— 
weary yet with the last day’s work—she leaves 
her parents in their bed, for their labour (if they 
have any) is not required so early. She trudges 
alone through rain and snow, and mire and dark- 
ness, to the mill, and there for thirteen, fourteen, 
sixteen, seventeen, or even eighteen hours is she 
obliged to work with only thirty minutes’ interval 
for meals and play. Homeward again at night 
she would go, when she was able, but many a time 
she hid herself in the wool in the mill, as she had 
not strength to go. And if she were one moment 
behind the appointed time; if the bell had ceased 
to ring when she arrived with trembling, shivering, 
weary limbs at the factory door, there stood a 
monster in human form, and as she passed he lashed 
her. This,” he continued, holding up an over- 
looker’s strap, ‘‘is no fiction. It was hard at

work in this town last week. The girl I am speak- 
ing of died; but she dragged on that dreadful 
existence for several years.’’? 
While Oastler was delivering this speech and 
these conditions were rife, Malthus was revising 
the first edition of his Essay on Population.

the United States a humanitarian move- 
ment, an aftermath well becoming a 
unique and heartrending struggle. In that pe- 
riod, humane endeavour, like so many creepers, 
overran ordinary activities, and philanthropic 
movements unprecedented sprang up over the 
country. 
Labour conditions until this period were about 
the same in the United States as they were in 
England. The Puritan idea had been that sin 
was in idleness, even for small children; ‘‘Colonial 
records bear evidence that it was a matter of 
conscience to keep children at work.’’* 
In the latter half of the eighteenth century the 
development of manufactures, especially the cloth- 
making industry, impressed on the American 
mind, as it had impressed the English mind, that Pre vista the Civil War, there began in

child labour was a national asset. When the 
first cotton factory was started at Beverly, Mass., 
it was stated that it would afford ‘‘employment 
to a great number of women and children many 
of whom will be otherwise useless, if not burden- 
some to society.’’* 
A special report was made by a committee to 
the Massachusetts Legislature in 1866 in which it 
was stated that representatives of the factories 
went about, systematically canvassing for small 
children: \/Small help is scarce; a great deal of 
machinery has been stopped for want of small 
help, so that the overseers have been going around 
to draw the small children from schools into the 
mills; the same as a draft in the army.” 
Asked if there were ‘‘any limit on the part of 
the employers as to the age when they take child- 
ren,” a witness replied: ‘“They’ll take them at any 
age they can get them, if they are old enough to 
Stand? 7 ., 22 
The same year that this report was made there 
was founded in New York a Society for the Pre- 
vention of Cruelty to Animals, in imitation of a 
similar society that had been founded in England, 
in 1823. Out of that movement in America there 
grew, in 1874, a movement to look after the rights 
of children, the first enunciation in terms of modern- 
ity of the fact that society must not only punish 
crimes against children, but that it must prevent

-P-A-G-E-416
  334 History of the Child 
them. Following the formation of this society, 
the first special laws ‘‘known in the world were 
enacted specifically to protect and punish wrongs 
to children.” 
The result of this development was that in 
1880 Frederick A. Agnew visited America and 
after an examination of the work being done in 
New York and the methods employed, returned 
to Liverpool, his home, and there in conjunction 
with Samuel Smith, M. P., founded the Liverpool 
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, 
in 1883—the first society in Europe to prevent 
wrongs against children. Shortly after this the 
Earl of Shaftesbury organized a similar movement 
in London. Then, under the auspices of the late 
M. Jules Simon, whose work in behalf of children 
has not yet been fully appreciated, the movement 
was taken up in France, M. Paul Nourisson and 
M. Ernest Nusse aiding greatly in bringing about 
a comprehensive law in relation to the prevention 
of cruelty to children. 
With Lieut.-Gen. D. von Pelet-Narbonne as 
* chairman, the ‘“‘ Verein zum Schutz der Kinder vor 
Ausnutzung und Misshandlung’’ was formed in 
Berlin. In 1899 Fraulein Lydia von Wolfring 
aided in the organization of the ‘‘ Wiener Kinder 
Schutz und Rettungs Verein” with von Krall, Privy 
Chancellor of Austria, as chairman. Count Bor- 
romeo inaugurated the movement at Milan in 
Italy where the padrone system flourished to such 
an extent as to indicate that the old Roman theory 
 
-P-A-G-E-417
    Mary Ellen’s Case 335 
of the patria potestas was still alive, at least with 
the peasants. Through the other countries of 
Europe the interest in the new movement ran and 
the work was taken up; then into India, China, 
and South America, until today there is no quarter 
of the globe where there is not a society, organized 
for the purpose of assisting the law in preventing 
crimes against the helpless child. 
Nothing indicates better the seeming accidental 
and casual beginnings of large movements than 
the formation of this first society in America. 
Like Vincent of Paul’s recognition of the horrible 
crimes that were being perpetrated in Paris only 
when he came face to face with an ill-treated 
infant, so it was only when it was discovered that, 
with all the law, there was no legal way of protect- 
ing an American child, that the child-protection 
movement, with its many subsequent laws in 
behalf of children, sprang up. 
‘A mission worker named Mrs. Etta A. Wheeler 
had found in what was then the slums of New York 
that a child, famous after as Mary Ellen, was being 
cruelly beaten and ill-treated by a man and woman 
who had taken it when it was less than two years 
of age froma charitable institution. Some idea of 
the condition among the slums of a large city of 
this time may be gained from the statement of a 
contemporary newspaper that ‘‘at least 10,000 
young boys roamed the streets of New York by 
day and took shelter by night in any place that 
seemed to afford a safe retreat, while their older 
 
-P-A-G-E-418
336 History of the Child 
and more vicious confederates planned how they 
should succeed in pilfering and plundering the 
public. The crumbling and rotten wooden docks 
of the metropolis had been for years haunted by 
these young vagabonds, and as they were at that 
time inefficiently policed, they were excellent 
localities for the incubators of petty thievery.”’) 
Unless these youngsters actually committed a 
crime, or unless someone collected evidence that 
they were leading an immoral life, they were free 
to do what they willed. 
Mrs. Wheeler was unable to gather the evi- 
dence necessary to remove the child in which she 
had become interested, and as the stories of the 
cruelties continued, she went to the Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, at the head of 
which was Henry Bergh, whose work in this direc- 
tion was as notable in this country as was Richard 
Martin’s in England. 
After consultation with the counsel of the 
Society, Elbridge T. Gerry, it was decided that 
“the child being an animal” the Society would 
act. Mr. Gerry after a careful examination of the 
evidence, sued out a writ de homine replegiando, 
the child was taken to court, complaints were 
made against the so-called guardians, and the 
woman who had cruelly beaten the child was 
afterwards sent to the penitentiary for one year. 
And so, for the first time by legal machinery, 
punishment was meted out for cruelty to children. 
When it became known that the Animal Soci-

ety, as it was called, would interest itself in child- 
ten who were being ill-treated, the complaints 
became numerous. It was decided that a separate 
society should be incorporated as a hand attached 
to the arm of the law. 
Of the various movements that grew out of the 
protection movement, none was more interesting 
or attracted more controversy than the endeav- 
ours to protect children of the stage. We have 
seen in the account of the elder Seneca and in 
the treatment by the mountebanks of children 
in Paris in the seventeenth century, how easily 
the unprotected child lent itself.to the calling of 
the vagabond entertainer. While no such bar- 
barities were practised in modern times, it was 
difficult for many people to realize that the child 
of five, undergoing training as an acrobat for 
long hours, was not being brought up in accord- 
ance with the modern theory of the obligations of 
the State toward the helpless. 
(_ The importation of children that had been sold 
by their parents in Italy was also a matter that 
the Society took up, and in 1879, the white 
slave question, even now a live question, arose 
in an endeavour to stop the padroni from bring- 
ing into America the minors they had gathered 
abroad. 
Probably the most important question that has 
come before the Society in recent years has been 
the proper treatment of those children who, for 
one reason or another, are brought into contact 
22  
-P-A-G-E-424
  338 History of the Child 
with the police. One of the first things that the 
New York Society did was to insist that the child- 
ren who had to be taken to court should not be 
mixed with the really criminal. In 1892 an amend- 
ment to the Penal Code made the separation im- 
perative, and out of this movement has grown the 
children’s court movement and the proper study 
of the so-called juvenile criminal. 
Another important branch of the child-protec- 
tion movement that had its beginning in New York 
City, was placing laws on the statute book, and 
then enforcing them, against the sale of injurious 
liquors to children. Laws tending to protect the 
morality of children followed these, and in fact al- 
most from the first year of its birth, every year 
has seen the Protection Society enlarging its field 
of action until today it hardly seems possible that 
it was only a few hundred years ago that the very 
life of a child itself was considered of no im- 
portance. 
The general law laid down by Spencer, in virtue 
of which everything passes ‘‘from the homogene- 
ous to the heterogeneous, from the indefinite to 
the definite, from the simple to the complex,’ is 
evident in the history of the progress of the child 
asa factor in society. 
When in neolithic times there was no moral 
instinct in man, the child’s only hope of life was 
the parental or rather the maternal instinct, of 
beings not yet risen to the plain of reasoning 
animals. In a higher stage of civilization one 
   
-P-A-G-E-425

finds, where the matriarchal régime exists, children 
have a value, the value of chattels and live stock, 
though the maternal uncle has more rights over 
them than their own father.' The patria potestas 
of the Romans was not so strange or unusual as 
it seemed to Gibbon, for the power of life and 
death (jus vite ac necis) is found among the

child takes on an importance of its own; it is 
humanely treated because it is now recognized as

on to the time when the child, as the father of the

3D TITLE. — 
Of Abandoned Children and Poor Orphans 
5. Abandoned children are those born of known 
parents and at first raised by them, or by other persons 
for them, and are abandoned by them, the where- 
abouts of the parents being unknown or there being 
no means of discovering them. 
6. Orphans are those who, not having either father 
or mother, have no means of subsistence. 
4TH TITLE. 
Of the Education of Foundlings, Abandoned Children, 
and Orphans. 
7. Newly born foundlings will be placed with a 
wet nurse as soon as possible; up to that they will be 
nourished by the bottle or even by means of wet 
nurses resident in the establishment. If they are 
weaned or susceptible of being weaned, they will either 
be put to nurse or weaned. 
8. These children will receive a layette. They will 
remain to the age of six years. 
g. At six years, all the children will be, or as 
many as can, put to board with farmers. The price 
of the board will increase each year up to the age 
of twelve, at which period the infant males in a 
state to serve will be placed at the disposition of the 
Minister of the Marine. 
10. The infants who cannot be put to board, the 
crippled and the infirm, will be raised in the hospitals. 
They will be occupied in the workshops at those 
employments that are not below their age.
-P-A-G-E-429
    Appendix A 343 
5TH TITLE. 
On the Expenses of Foundlings, Abandoned Children, 
and Orphans. 
11. Hospitals designated to receive foundlings 
are directed to furnish the layettes and all the inside 
expenses pertaining to the nourishment and education 
of the children. 
12. We herewith set aside the sum of 4,000,000 
francs annually to contribute to the monthly payment 
of wet nurses and the boarding of the foundlings 
and abandoned children. 
If it should turn out after the division of this sum 
that it is inadequate, the difference will be provided 
by the hospitals from their revenues or by drawing on 
the funds of the community. 
13. The monthly payments of the nurses and their 
board shall not be made except on the certificate of the 
mayors of the communities where the children are. 
The mayors must attest each month that they have 
seen the children. 
14. The administrative commissioners of the 
hospitals will visit at least twice in the year each 
infant, either a special commission, or by physicians 
or surgeons, vaccinators or others. 
6TH TITLE. 
Of the Guardianship and of Foundling Children and 
Abandoned Children 
15. Foundling and abandoned children are under 
the guardianship of the hospital, in conformance with 
existing regulations. A member of this commission is 
especially charged with this guardianship.
-P-A-G-E-430
  344 Appendix A 
| 
16. The aforesaid children, brought up at the cost 
of the State, are entirely at its disposition, and when 
the Minister of Marine so decides, the guardianship 
of the Commission ceases. 
17. When the infants have reached the age of 
twelve years, those whom the State has made no 
disposition of will, as soon as it is possible to do 
so, be apprenticed out, the boys with the workmen, 
the girls with housewives, seamstresses, and other 
workwomen in the factories or manufacturing es- 
tablishments. 
18. The contracts of apprenticeship shall not 
stipulate in favour of either the master or the appren- 
tice, but they will guarantee the master the free 
services of the apprentice up to an age which shall not 
exceed the twenty-fifth year, and the apprentice food, 
shelter and clothing. 
19. At the call of the army, or a conscription, 
the obligations of the apprentice will cease. 
20. Those of the infants who cannot be put out as 
apprentices, the crippled and the infirm, who cannot 
find places outside of the hospitals will remain there 
as a charge to each hospital. 
Workshops will be established in order to provide 
them with employment. 
7TH TITLE. 
On the Recognition and Announcement (Reclamation) 
of Foundlings and Abandoned Children. 
21. No charge is made in the rules relative to the 
recognition and advertising of foundling and aban- 
doned children, but before exercising any right, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-431
    Appendix A 345 
parents must, if they have the means, reimburse the 
authorities for all expenses made either by the State 
or by the hospitals, and in no case, can an infant of 
which the State has made disposition, be released 
until those obligations are met. 
8TH TITLE. 
General “‘ Dispositions” 
22. The Minister of the Interior will propose to us 
before January 1, 1812, the rules of administration, 
which will be discussed in our Council of State. These 
rules will determine, for each department, the number 
of hospitals where foundlings will be received and 
all that relates to their administration concerning 
principally the disposition of the infants now in 
charge and the payment for nurses and boarding. 
23. Individuals who are convicted of having 
exposed children and those who make it a practice of 
transporting them to hospitals will be punished in 
accordance with the law. 
24. Our Minister of Marine will present to us a 
plan dealing with: 1st. An organization relative to 
those clauses in which his powers are defined in this 
decree. 2d. For the regulation of the employment 
without delay of those who, on the ist of January, 
will become twelve years of age. 
25. Our Minister of the Interior is directed to see 
to the execution of the present decree and will have it 
inserted in the bulletin of laws.

AMERICAN CONSULATE, 
ALEPPO, Syria, December 15, 1913. 
Subject: TREATMENT OF CHILDREN. 
(Consul, JEssE B. JACKSON, ALEPPO, SyRIA.) 
THE HONOURABLE, 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE, 
WASHINGTON. 
Sir: 
I have the honour to report as follows concerning the 
treatment of children by the various races and sects 
in Aleppo Consular District, viz.: 
In many ways the treatment of children by the 
various races and sects inhabiting Northern Syria 
differs vastly from that practised in other countries. 
Strangely similar in one particular to the custom of the 
American Indian, immediately after birth the child 
is wrapped in cloths until it resembles the form of a 
mummy of ancient Egyptian times, in which state it is 
kept and carried about by nurses and small children 
until it is considered old enough to learn to walk, when 
it is given the freedom of its limbs. Very young babies 
must suffer considerably by this treatment, evidenced 
by their constant restlessness and crying, no doubt 
preventing the baby from attaining to its natural 
strength and activity until after it has been free for 
349
-P-A-G-E-436
      350 Appendix C 
  some months. During cold weather a ball of a certain 
kind of clay about the capacity of a quart is heated 
and kept wrapped at the feet of the infant to prevent 
it catching cold. Among certain of the lower classes 
the illness of a girl baby does not cause the anxiety 
that it does in the case of a boy, consequently causing 
a much higher rate of mortality among the female 
than the male children. 
Among the Arabs, as soon as the children of the 
tribesmen are six or seven years old they are put to 
herding sheep and goats, which vocation they generally 
follow during their lives, never going to school or 
having any kind of instruction. The sons of the 
sheiks (chiefs) of the tribes are either sent to school in 
the cities, or a private tutor, usually a ‘“‘hodja” 
(Mohammedan teacher or priest), is engaged, while 
the girls are given no education whatever. 
The position of a girl varies greatly as between the 
different races and sects of the country. For instance, 
among the Arab and Kurdish tribes, and the Fellaheen 
(non-Christian farmers), a girl is a source of revenue 
to the father who, when she is of marriageable age, 
trades or sells her to her prospective husband, ob- 
taining live stock or money to the equivalent of eight 
to twenty ‘‘chees,” or $176 to $440 (a ‘‘chees” equals 
$22.00), the selling price depending upon the beauty 
of the girl and the prominence of her family from the 
standpoint of wealth and influence. Among these 
races the really fat girl commands the highest admira- 
tion. The heavier she is the more she is desired and 
the better price she brings. 
Formerly the Christian and Hebrew families gave 
their girls little schooling, but instead taught them 
to do embroidery and crochet work. Among even
-P-A-G-E-437
    Appendix C 351 
relatively poor families there exists a certain pride that 
causes housework to be regarded as degrading, and 
only those will become servants who are forced to do so 
by straitened circumstances. In late years there is 
a tendency to give the girls some education, which the 
Christians and Jews receive at the mission establish- 
ments of the Americans, French, English, Italians, 
Germans, Swiss, etc., while a very limited number 
of Mohammedan girls attend local public schools 
conducted exclusively for them. 
Contrary to the custom prevailing among the Arabs, 
Kurds, and Fellaheen, the Christians and Jews greatly 
prefer to have boy babies, and it is considered a great 
misfortune if most or all of the children of a family are 
girls. The boys are sent to the respective community 
and foreign mission schools, and some of the more 
enlightened and progressive families afterwards send 
their boys to the colleges at Beyrouth, Syria, to 
complete their education. 
It is the main object of every such family to marry 
off the girls as soon as possible, for it is considered a 
great shame to the girl if she is left unmarried until 
after twenty or twenty-two years of age. Marriage 
is the most important event, and the only one in 
which she is in any way prominent in all her life. Her 
great object in life is to become a wife and be the 
mother of a boy, the latter event always raising her 
in the estimation of her acquaintances and friends, and 
giving her considerable importance for the time being, 
whereas it is the contrary if the baby is a girl. In 
many families the young wife is not permitted to speak 
aloud in the presence of strangers or of the father-in- 
law until a boy is born to her. 
Parents generally engage their children at very 
 
-P-A-G-E-438
  352 Appendix C 
early ages, in which little attention is paid to the wishes 
or dislikes of the prospective bride and groom. In 
fact, unborn children are sometimes provisionally 
engaged to each other by their parents, either for 
sentimental or financial reasons. Perhaps three- 
fourths of the girls of the country are married before 
they reach the age of sixteen, and many are married 
between twelve and fourteen. 
The consideration paid on the occasion of the 
marriage of non-Mohammedan, or Christian and 
Jewish girls, goes the other way from that paid at the 
marriage of an Arab girl, it being the desire of the 
groom to have as large a dowry as possible for his 
wife, and which goes to help make up the family 
exchequer. It consequently results that if a family 
that is not well to do has many girls it is very difficult 
to marry them well. 
A certain brutality of parents towards their children 
exists among the lower classes, a condition that is 
probably due more to inferior intelligence caused by 
lack of education than to anything else. As but a very 
small minority of the population of this part of the 
country, say twenty per cent., and a much smaller 
proportion of the tribes of the interior read and write, 
this attitude is readily understood. 
The prevalence of crippled begging children in the 
cities leads to the supposition that they are not all 
deformed by accident or disease, but that in many 
instances they have been purposely so rendered in 
order to more profitably ply their trade by creating 
sympathy in the minds of the persons addressed in 
their appeals forsuccour. During the summer months 
a considerable number of such pitiable creatures 
between four and eight years old may be seen in the
-P-A-G-E-439
    Appendix C 353 
streets of Aleppo, some with deformed legs, some with 
spinal afflictions, and others blind or otherwise 
maimed, many unable to walk and hutching from 
place to place, collecting coppers from those whom 
their condition touches. As the hour grows late in the 
night these unfortunates gradually disappear one by 
one, and if a person is interested in their destination 
they may be seen to be gathered up in some obscure 
corner by an apparent relative or guardian, lifted to 
the shoulder and carried away into the maze of var- 
jous Oriental residential quarters, where their scanty 
collection is spent in support of a family, or for the 
poisonous rakee, a strong alcoholic drink much 
relished by the lower element. It was suspected that 
a sort of society existed whereby such children were 
produced and let out to certain parties to be exploited 
for their personal benefit, but no serious investigation 
has ever been made, and the nefarious traffic continues.

AMERICAN CONSULAR SERVICE, 
SrerrA Leone, Arrica, April 7, 1914. 
GrorGE Henry Payne, EsqQ., 
New York. 
Sir: 
Yours dated November 1, 1913, has been in my 
hands some time. The information you request is 
rather broad, and would require much investigation 
to be of any real service to you. Certainly I have 
some information, in a general way, but to write it 
would take much more space than a letter could 
contain. But in short, the attitude of the natives of 
Sierra Leon at present toward children is all of that 
of a primitive people emerging into European civiliza- 
tion. Children are regarded very much as a financial 
asset, especially by the mothers, and are kept much 
under the influence and control of the mothers so long 
as they live. Those emerging out of tribal customs 
 
-P-A-G-E-441
  Appendix C 355 
into European customs have pretty much the same 
relations as exist between parents and children in 
Europe or America. However, there is little love 
between the child and father, generally speaking, 
but much between mother and child. Boys usually 
remain in the care of the mothers until they reach 
the age of puberty, at which time they leave the 
association of their mothers and sisters and have that 
of their older brothers and fathers, almost exclusively. 
Upon leaving their mothers’ care and training they 
are usually, among those who cling to tribal customs, 
turned over to the ‘‘medicine man,’ or doctor, who 
claims to know much. They are taken into the ‘‘Poro 
Society’? where they are circumcised, and taught the 
duties of a man, the use of certain native medicines, 
etc. The girls remain in the care of the mothers, but 
at the age of puberty, or a little while before, are 
placed into the care of one or more old women who . 
conduct a female school, the ‘‘bundoo” society, where 
the girls have an operation performed upon them 
similar to circumcision, and are taught the duties of a 
mother and wife, how to care for themselves, and the 
use of certain native medicines. The rule is that the 
girls are not eligible for marriage until they have been 
through the ‘‘bundoo,” and boys or young men not 
until they have been circumcised; but in addition 
boys must earn their wives by the payment of dowries 
—presents to the girls’ mothers and fathers. Children 
are usually required to perform such work or labor as 
they are physically able to perform, strict obedience 
to their parents and great respect for their seniors, 
even for older brothers and sisters, though they be not 
grown. Children are expected to care for and to 
provide for their parents in their old age. Etc.

GerorGE HENRY PAYNE, EsQuirRE, 
New York Ciry. 
DEAR Sir: 
In reply to your inquiry regarding the attitude of 
the people of Japan toward children and the practice 
of infanticide, I have the following, which is the result 
of interviews with representative Japanese and of my 
own observations. 
As arule, Japanese are very kind to children and 
very fond of them; usually they are allowed their own 
way a good deal when small and spoiled so that very 
severe discipline is administered later in an effort to 
correct this. Among the lower classes children are 
very often looked upon as a sort of insurance or 
investment against old age; also the system of ancestor 
worship makes it a highly desirable thing to have 
children, particularly sons. For these reasons children 
are looked upon with great favour and large families 
are the rule. 
Infanticide ‘s now a crime and is so strictiy and 
severely punished that it cannot be said to be common, 
although it does exist to some extent. However, up 
to about fifty years ago this was not the case; it was 
not a crime and was very common. The father of a 
 
-P-A-G-E-443
  
  Appendix C 357 
family had supreme power over the family, even 
including the power of life and death, and was free to 
do with his children almost as he chose. In regions 
where the people were poor, infanticide was the 
regularly recognized means of preventing large fami- 
lies. The following incident illustrates this very well: 
In a certain section in northern faokn was a district 
where so little could be produced that the people 
were very poor and no family had more than one or 
two children, infanticide being regularly practised. 
The feudal lord of the district, being a wise man, 
decided to remedy this condition, which he proceeded 
to do by a system of irrigation which made the district 
quite fertile; immediately the size of the families rose 
to eight and ten and infanticide disappeared. 
With regret for my long delay in answering, which 
has been due to an effort to find some books on this 
subject, and trusting that this may cs some slight 
use to you, 
Iam, 
Yours very truly, 
jee. Kr 
Assistant Japanese Secretary. 
AMERICAN ConsULATE-GENERAL, 
Santo Dominco, D, R., December 16, 1913. 
Mr. Grorce Henry PAYNE, 
New York, N. Y. 
SiR: 
In reply to yours of November 1, 1913, I have not 
been able to find any material of interest in regard to 
the attitude of the natives before the landing of 
   
-P-A-G-E-444
  358 Appendix C 
Columbus. The ruthless attitude of the Spaniards 
toward the natives is well known, and apparently 
neither women nor children were spared. The treat- 
ment of the natives resulted in their rapid decrease in 
number, and as early as 1510 the traffic in African 
slaves was begun and long continued. 
Statistics as to the present condition of the child 
are few. During a typical quarterly period there were 
registered 8288 births (4269 males and 4019 females) 
but this probably represents only a portion of the 
actual births; of this number 3290 were legitimate and 
4998 illegitimate. This does not, however, represent 
the extreme state of immorality that it might indicate, 
as mating lasting through years and clung to with 
fidelity and accompanied by a tender care for the 
offspring is frequently not preceded by a marriage 
ceremony, which is regarded as more or less of a use- 
less expense. The population of the Republic is not 
known but is estimated as approximating 600,000. 
As among the Spanish races in general, great affec- 
tion is shown to children. Fathers and mothers, 
brothers and sisters lavish caresses upon them con- 
tinually and in public. 
There being few factories ia the Dominican Republic, 
child labour, as we know it, does not exist. Children 
early begin to earn their living, but the work is mostly 
in the open air or open shops and labour conditions are 
far from strenuous. The clothing worn by children is 
scant, and youngsters of the lower classes up to the 
age of five or six years usually run nude, decorated 
only by a necklace or a pair of earrings 
School facilities, though provided by the State, are 
inadequate. The reported annual attendance at all 
schools in the country is only 20,000. 
 
-P-A-G-E-445
    
Appendix C 359 
Health conditions in the island are good. The 
total deaths registered in one quarter (again short of 
the real figures) is 1770, of which 318 deaths were of 
children less than a year old, and 336 of children 
between one and five years. The number of persons 
reported guilty of crimes or disorders in one quarter 
totaled 1910, of which 301 were between fourteen and 
twenty-one years of age.

Mr. GeorGE Henry PAYNE,

Sir: 
Your letter requesting information for your book 
on the history of the attitude of states and tribes 
toward children received. Such information as has 
been obta‘ned would indicate that the South African 
natives in this section are universally kind to children. 
The only “‘natives’’ in this district, using the words 
in a strict sense, are the ‘‘Bantus’’ otherwise the 
Kaffirs. These people are specially fond of children 
and use them well. ? 
If a child is left an orphan, any relative, no matter 
how distant, is willing to adopt the child. Indeed the 
services of the magistrate are frequently required in 
deciding disputes between claimants.

Social Progress and 
the Darwinian 
Theory 
A Study of Force as a Factor in 
Human Relations 
By George W. Nasmyth, Ph.D. 
With an Introduction by 
Norman Angell 
The philosophy of force, according 
to the author, is the real cause of the 
breakdown of civilization in Europe. 
This philosophy claims to find a scien- 
tific foundation in the application to 
human society of Darwin’s theory of 
“the struggle for existence” and the “sur- 
vival of the fittest.”’ A critical study of 
this so-called “Social Darwinism,” which 
upon analysis is found to consist in a be- 
lief that collective homicide is the cause 
of human progress, shows it to be entirely 
false. Moreover it is in direct contra- 
diction to the ideas of Darwin himself, 
who bases his whole theory of social pro- 
gress upon justice and the moral law.
